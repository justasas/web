1
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,468
Hey.

2
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,143
Look at this.

3
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,321
Hey.

4
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,573
Look.

5
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,753
It is the voice of the dead.

6
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,862
This is gold.

7
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,537
Oaks.

8
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,411
You won't get away with this, Oaks!

9
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,721
Give me water.

10
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,434
Water.

11
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,788
Gold.

12
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,794
There's gold for everyone.

13
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,211
Gold...

14
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,467
Down at the river.

15
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,268
It's cold as anything in here!

16
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,066
Sure, it's cold as anything.
Get your pants on.

17
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,278
Hell, come on this side.
It's deep here!

18
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,572
Come on in!

19
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,450
That feels nice and fresh!

20
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,157
You need a bath.

21
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,334
This side is deeper.
Come over here and see.

22
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,406
Hey, run for cover!

23
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,206
Take cover! Take cover!

24
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,791
Get down!

25
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,214
Come on, hurry up!
Get out of the way!

26
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,506
They're all around us!

27
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,212
How many are there?

28
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,720
We better not waste time, boys.
Come on, give me a hand.

29
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,801
Let's get this down.

30
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,311
Sure is heavy.

31
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,230
Let's have a look.

32
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,167
Yahoo!

33
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,831
This'll make life a lot easier for all of us.

34
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,911
The answer to anyone's troubles is gold,
and we got plenty of it.

35
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,464
The secret is knowing the right moment.

36
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,347
This time we really hit the jackpot, huh?

37
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,181
Oaks, mind if I butt in
on the conversation you're having...

38
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,731
...with yourself?

39
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,605
Let me in on it.
I want to cross the border.

40
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,187
We've gotta be in Mexico before dark.

41
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,695
I was talking to myself because I've
got a lot of gold to talk about.

42
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,447
We sure do.
We each got a good share coming.

43
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,904
We worked hard for it.
What's more, it's pleasing work.

44
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,662
Lots of gold and lots of pleasure,
but now it's time to divide it up.

45
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,164
Well?

46
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,790
Don't we?

47
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,372
I don't feel like dividing.

48
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,018
You hear that?
Says he don't feel like dividing.

49
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,978
I don't think I can believe my ears.

50
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,556
I'll say it again.

51
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,483
I don't feel like dividing.

52
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,560
I've come too far,
done too much...

53
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,988
...to let anyone else
get their hands on this gold.

54
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,065
I've had to put up
with the stink of your skins.

55
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,527
I don't divide my gold
with no motherless Mexicans.

56
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,373
<i>Qué pasa?</i>

57
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,840
Hands up, you two.

58
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,281
Shoot! Shoot! Don't let him get away!
Shoot him down!

59
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,518
Tough luck, half-breed.

60
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,932
Guns don't shoot with no bullets inside.

61
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,850
Dig it wide. Dig it deep.

62
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,773
Hey, boys, that's a beautiful grave.

63
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,067
Ain't seen one bigger.

64
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,895
You're gonna be real comfortable.

65
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,232
Ain't that right, boss?

66
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,402
We work for you...

67
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:32,206
...and now you are going to kill us
without giving us one drop of tequila.

68
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,874
You'll be able to say your prayers in Spanish...

69
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,747
...as you lie down to die.

70
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,595
How 'bout your half-breed prayers, huh?

71
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,296
In English or Spanish?

72
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,758
I don't have to pray for salvation
once I've been killed.

73
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,764
You do.

74
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,345
You're a murderer.

75
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:02,899
I'm pleased to call you my friend,
since you're gonna give me your gold.

76
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,129
Hey!
Catch that man!

77
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,377
Don't let him get away!
Kill him!

78
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,299
What's he doing?

79
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,377
Quick, shoot him down!

80
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,214
Don't let him get away!

81
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,228
They can't leave without horses.

82
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,733
Jack! Montana! You gotta do something
to stop him! Save the horses!

83
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,235
You won't be goin' no place without horses, Oaks.

84
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,411
The horses are getting away!

85
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,915
You're scaring the horses away!
Hold your fire.

86
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,018
I must say, you've done a brilliant job.

87
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,982
You won't get away with this, Oaks!

88
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,279
Fire!

89
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,808
With gold-made bullets.

90
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,437
It is your gold.
The gold you died for.

91
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,611
Gold bullets better than lead.
Go deeper.

92
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,239
For you who have seen
the ﬂame of death...

93
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,817
...gold can be useful
to fire at your killers.

94
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,493
We stay with you.
Be your companions.

95
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,573
But you tell us
of happy hunting grounds you've seen...

96
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,453
...on other side of river of life.

97
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,626
You who have seen the land of the dead...

98
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,672
...must give us the wisdom you have learned
from the mouths of the great gods.

99
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,546
If you remember and tell us these things...

100
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,922
...we will serve you and follow you.

101
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,610
Give up? Give up!

102
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,834
No, please, Uncle Max!

103
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,844
No, don't! I'll bite you.

104
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,093
I'll bite you!

105
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,779
Sure don't look like heaven.

106
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,200
It's better than the desert though.

107
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,545
You're not aimin' to stay here?

108
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,670
Don't like the looks of it.

109
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,172
And where do you suggest we go, Collins?

110
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,381
It's hot out here and I need a drink.

111
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,639
I'm hungry, fellas, and when I'm hungry
like I'm hungry, I ain't afraid of a thing.

112
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,517
You can bet your life I'm not.

113
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,769
He's right. One town's the same as the next.

114
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,601
There's nothin' to be afraid of, Collins.

115
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,437
Who's afraid?
Nobody here's a coward.

116
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,773
I just said I -

117
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,483
I don't fancy the looks of it.

118
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,194
Why don't you shut up?

119
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,826
We ain't got no choice.
I'm hungry too.

120
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,721
You stay here with the horses,
and I mean stay with 'em.

121
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,555
You go to the store.

122
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,028
You two come with me.

123
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:23,116
Make them horses drink slow,
Charley, if you don't want 'em to bust.

124
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,422
Good morning to all you gentlemen.

125
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,671
Great little town you got here.

126
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,798
First time in these parts.

127
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,014
You can see right away
it's real friendly here.

128
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,592
Any one of you interested
in selling a few horses?

129
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,100
We're headed north. There's work waitin' for
us up there, but we can't walk all the way.

130
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,433
Most of our horses met with accidents.

131
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,777
Kept gettin' dizzy from the heat.

132
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,480
So I said crawl or hop.

133
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,361
So here we are.

134
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,339
Stop throwin' darts, Evan.

135
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,295
Come on, put 'em down.
Let's see what you got.

136
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,048
No, no. First put up your money.

137
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,756
Ain't no lack of horse meat here.
just that they cost money.

138
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,140
No problem there, mister.

139
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:37,019
We earned ourselves a lot of money,
and we're prepared to pay.

140
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,812
Whiskey all around.
You heard him.

141
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,977
The best.

142
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,813
From the look of you,
you had yourself a long walk.

143
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,196
It's worth a long walk
to find yourself work to do...

144
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,619
...if it pays well.

145
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,449
It's real nice to meet some people
who work like you, mister.

146
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,626
It's enough to take one good look at you.

147
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,456
You can see from your expression
that you're hardworking and honest.

148
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,540
You're all covered in white dust.

149
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,921
I guess you must have crossed the desert.

150
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,596
You took the toughest way
to get to my old hometown, huh?

151
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,425
Best way for you, huh?

152
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,227
Now you can sell your horses.

153
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,226
You talk like a businessman.

154
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,982
Well, how about it?
We ain't got time to lose.

155
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,313
I told you, horses cost money here.

156
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,540
This is better than money.

157
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,413
That's what I'll pay you with.

158
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,669
Well, how many horses
do you have to have?

159
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,750
Nine.

160
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,458
You got more of this to pay for the rest?

161
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,385
Sure.

162
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,139
I'll do my best to get them for you.

163
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,933
Hey, Richie, why don't you play
some music for our guests, huh?

164
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,106
Florie. Florie!

165
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,275
What are you waitin' for?
Come on down.

166
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,524
We got gentlemen here to be entertained.

167
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,401
Let 'em hear one of your songs.

168
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,032
<i>♪</i> My town <i>is so</i> nice <i>♪</i>

169
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,081

How about that?
She's a pretty girl. Real pretty.

173
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,801
A pretty voice too.
Uh-huh.

Do you want anything else?

182

No, no. That'll do.

183
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,669
Now let's just see what we got.

184
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,960
It seems you want a lot of vittles.

185
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,791
Yeah, we got a mighty long ride ahead of us.

186
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,252
We're makin' for the north
to begin work there.

187
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,797
Dried salt beef, sugar...

188
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,974
...beans, two cases of...

189
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:45,226
And we're gonna need at least
10 boxes of carbine cartridges.

190
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,977
Ten boxes?

191
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,777
If you went hunting you wouldn't find
that much to shoot in these parts.

192
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,853
Please excuse me.

193
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,564
Won't be long.

194
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,900
Hello, Alderman.
And good day.

195
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,450
You should see the gold they got.
They're a bandit gang.

196
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,035
Hmm.

197
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,462

208
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,839
Don't you get the impression
it's kind of black in here?

209
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,673
Sure don't seem natural.

210
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,850
That's stupid.

211
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,393
It's just the desert.

212
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,766
We've become used to the sun.

213
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,037
Don't move. You are still weak.

214
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,412
But I feel a lot better.

215
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,839
I'm stronger than I look.

216
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,839
Can't you make this horse
get a move on?

217
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,762
He move more slowly now because he is old.

218
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,808
How do you ever expect to get there?

219
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:52,478
The men we follow have no meat or water,
and few horses to carry them.

220
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,186
They will stop in small town over hill.

221
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,687
How much further is it?

222
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,939
Not far.

223
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,027
It lies in next valley at edge of desert.

224
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,111
But what's the name of it?

225
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,869
I not know what white man call it.

226
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,373
The people of the Indian tribes
call it the Unhappy Place.

227
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,090
Hurry. This way. Follow me.

228
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,804
Come on, hurry!

229
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,881
Can't let 'em get away.

230
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,885
What are you waiting for?

231
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,999
Get 'em!

232
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,042
We can't let them get away!

233
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,847
Hold him. Hold him.

234
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,060
Keep him down!

235
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,326
Hold him!

236
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,916
Hurry up!
Stop him! Stop him!

237
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,533
Hold him still while I get
this rope around his neck.

238
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,417
Get that rope around there.
Come on.

239
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,218
Come on, get a move on.

240
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,926
Mother of God forgive you all.

241
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,977
May they hang you for this.

242
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,122
There's plenty of rope to spare
in this town, and little else.

243
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,255
Now you're supposed to be hanging
these men, so get on with it!

244
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:31,071
Thieves, murderers-
There's no salvation for men like you.

245
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,903
Pray for forgiveness to Almighty God.

246
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,080
That one there is starting to dance.

247
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,998
Get out your harmonica, Slim.

248
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,825
He looks like a fish out of water!

249
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,502
Hey! There's one still alive.

250
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,043
Well, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, what are you waiting for?

251
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,673
He's getting away!

252
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,674
He's gone around the corner!

253
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,554
Go this way!

254
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,562
Go around the other side!

255
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,150
Get down over there!
Come on!

256
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,776
Get under cover.

257
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,283
Get down!

258
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,374
He's cornered.

259
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,473
You'll never get out of that house alive, Oaks,
long as I'm here.

260
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,698
What's wrong with you?

261
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,821
Ain't there someone here
with a bit of courage?

262
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,244
I'll offer $500 for the man who'll get him out.

263
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,001
My eyes must be playin' tricks.

264
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,721
It isn't him.

265
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,549
It can't be.

266
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,403
Who is it?

267
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,822
Who is it?

268
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,711
Who are you?

269
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,808
How have you got here?
I have to know!

270
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,197
You've come back from hell!

271
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,214
Go on, fire!
You're all supposed to be dead!

272
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,681
Go on, fire!

273
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,100
Why don't you come on out
from behind there?

274
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,614
My leg. My leg!

275
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,379
Don't leave him there.
String him up with the rest of'em.

276
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,349
Wait.
What's goin' on?

277
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,300
It's Sorrow.

278
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,136
Wait, I said. Put him down.

279
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,388
You heard me.

280
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:20,521
This man interests me.
I want him alive.

281
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,321
He has some information I want.
There's plenty of time for hanging.

282
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:28,026
Why wait, Mr. Sorrow? You know darn
well we're gonna hang the man anyway.

283
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,236
Pancho!
Yes, sir.

284
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,820
What is it, Mr. Sorrow?

285
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,077
Get those bullets out of him,
and make sure you bring him to me alive.

286
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,908
Come on, men.
Help me get him out of here.

287
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,919
I didn't know pity was part of your nature.

288
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,550
You know better than that, Alderman.

289
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,757
There are a few things I want to
find out concerning those men.

290
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,434
They're a bunch of killers-murdering outlaws...

291
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,728
...and we done what we felt had to be done.

292
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,726
But you don't know what it is I heard.

293
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:02,272
We just brought them to justice.
They couldn't hide much from me, Mr Sorrow.

294
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,774
By God, you can have all the justice you like.

295
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,485
I got an eye skinned for something
much more important.

296
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,740
Come on, Willy.

297
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,119
I got a little talkin'
and a little listening to do.

298
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,949
Do as you choose, Mr. Sorrow.

299
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,501
We can help.
That's wise of you.

300
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,375
Now let's see what miracles Pancho can perform.

301
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,723
We want to know something.

302
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,150
Are you going to stay here or move on?

303
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,946
I guess I'll stay.

304
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,496
Here. You won't feel a thing.

305
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,295
Go on, do it.

306
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,227
Stop yelling, you coward.

307
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,648
Keep going, Pancho. Hurry up.

308
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,476
He'll be better in no time, right?

309
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:53,063
And he'll be eager to tell us his life story.

310
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,697
A horrific story full of crime and murder.

311
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,529
I refuse to listen.

312
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,115
I love autobiographical memoirs.

313
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,292
I can't wait to hear them.

314
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:11,294
I hope our word of good citizens will carry a
lot more weight than the lies of a criminal.

315
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,921
No, Tern pier.

316
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,970
I'll have my usual raspberry syrup drink.

317
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,769
Good for you, Pancho. You got it.

318
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,346
He's as good as a real doctor.

319
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,731
But this is gold. Gold!

320
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,435
Gold?

321
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,026
What are you doing? Stand back!

322
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,781
Back!

323
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:45,115
Pancho, you idiot!
You didn't have to kill him, did you?

324
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:48,077
I'm sorry, sir, but all my life
I've searched for gold...

325
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,911
...and this man is full of it.

326
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,496
Bah!

327
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,462
Ahh.

328
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,168
This bullet's solid gold.

329
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,424
Yeah, they shot him full of gold, Mr. Sorrow.

330
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,177
I don't like these kind of games you're playing.

331
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,258
It's no game.

332
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,432
Gold is a sure way to kill a man.

333
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,061
It's a game, all right...

334
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,440
...and I'd say a very expensive one for a gunman.

335
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,487
Thirty dollars a shot.

336
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,816
Sure. It was an investment.

337
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:24,204
You're, uh, gonna give me that $500,
aren't you mister?

338
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,953
Since when did he get so generous?

339
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,999
You're gonna pay $500?

340
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,624
It's not for me, Mr. Sorrow,
but for the public good.

341
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,627
Justice is worth paying any price for.

342
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:38,051
I wouldn't count a lot on seeing
that money, stranger, if I were you.

343
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,299
It's only gold, isn't it?

344
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,222
All right, stranger.
Here's your $500.

345
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,268
That's what you came in here to collect.

346
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,730
Well, right now what I need's a bed.

347
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,732
Pay me tomorrow.

348
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,310
There's no hurry.

349
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,536
You got a room for me, boy?
Yes, sir. Right away.

350
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,096
Listen to me, Templer.

351
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,596
Nobody in this place
gives anything away for nothing.

352
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,517
You can be sure of that.

353
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,517
You were in a little bit too much
of a hurry to hang those guys.

354
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,974
And that young stranger helped you out.

355
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,980
Now this one's dead,  and no one can talk.

356
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,484
Those outlaws were much too dangerous.
No point in waiting to be killed.

357
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,315
I don't care about them gringos.

358
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,900
Only what they had.

359
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,079
A load of gold- that's what I'm
talking about and what I want.

360
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,579
Saddlebags full of gold.
Not those gold bullets either.

361
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,036
Go get it and bring it to me.

362
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,049
I don't know what they've been telling you...

363
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,217
...but if there was any,
someone has escaped with it.

364
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,838
I keep my cowboys wide awake...

365
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:09,301
...and since this is my own land, nobody goes
through it without my hearing about it.

366
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,183
Alderman here is a witness.
Aren't you?

367
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:16,107
It's not me that's the witness,
but the Lord in heaven who showed us the way.

368
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,810
We'll find it, whatever it is.

369
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,736
Don't you worry about that.

370
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,906
Come on, boys! Let's go.

371
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,529
Look. Here it is.

372
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,285
Just like I said.

373
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,411
He signed his name with a cross.

374
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,665
Bill, I don't understand why
you didn't give him the money.

375
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,997
He didn't want it.
Just wanted to sleep here.

376
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,175
Listen.

377
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,763
Not sleeping very good.

378
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,969
Well, he's not gonna get the chance
to sleep late.

379
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,851
Tomorrow he can take his dollars and get out.

380
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,776
I knew it. I suppose you're gonna
give all the money we saved to him.

381
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,944
How about all those things
we planned together?

382
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,397
Don't you worry yourself about that.

383
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,030
You mean you'll marry me? I don't
like being just your woman.

384
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,237
Sure, Florie. I'll marry you.

385
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,632
You mean it, Bill, don't you?

386
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,715
Sure. You know I do.

387
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,971
Soon as we can.

388
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,099
Listen. That man stopped walking.

389
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,522
Be fair. I ought to have
at least twice your cut.

390
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,570
You must be crazy, Templer.
Well, I was the one who found it.

391
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,152
Uh-huh. How would you have hidden
it if I hadn't helped you?

392
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,112
I could have gotten
someone else to do that.

393
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,698
Is that so? And who's lent
you money all these years...

394
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,283
...that you never paid back?

395
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,663
Listen, Alderman.

396
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,791
I made investments that could be
useful to the whole community.

397
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,794
It's your money, but what did you do with it?

398
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,760
I spent it improving this town, making it prosper.

399
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,759
I paid you my interest, and plenty of that.

400
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,887
No man can say I was anything but honest.

401
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,640
I've defended the morals
of the folk here always.

402
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:43,724
I've never been afraid to teach the
way of justice and the fear of God.

403
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,477
I taught half of them to pray.

404
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,485
Now we must divide this gold,
split it equally.

405
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,740
Or do you want to cause trouble
that will attract the attention of Sorrow?

406
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,786
Is that your kind of justice?

407
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,957
That's just what I expected, you swindler.

408
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,785
You can't fool me,
you low-down chiseler!

409
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,963
Keep your voice down, Templer.

410
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,049
It's not enough.
It's all you'll get.

411
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,003
This gold is going to be divided equally.

412
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,095
We'll see about that.
Are you threatening me?

413
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,467
You're not goin' nowhere with that.
I'm taking my share.

414
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,017
We decided what that is.

415
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,971
Half! That's what it is.

416
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,150
Stay where you are.
Get out of my way.

417
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,190
It's mine! I warned you.
Leave it where it is.

418
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,363
You can't stop me taking my share.

419
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,156
Nothin'! That's your share.

420
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,985
My share is half. Half!
Do you hear?

421
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,952
Who's there?

422
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,332
Mind if I talk to you, sir?

423
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,417
What do you want?

424
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,549
I want to ask you a favor.

425
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,176
You woke me up.

426
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,805
Is it very late?
Yeah, it is, sir.

427
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,519
Well? What do you want?

428
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,229
Come on, speak up.

429
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,940
I wanted to ask you to take me with you, sir.

430
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,404
With me?

431
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,283
Where to?

432
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,114
Doesn't matter where.

433
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,295
That reminds me.
I've gotta go somewhere too.

434
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,428
You're a brave man.
Brave as anyone here.

435
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,177
Take me with you, sir.

436
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,508
Being brave's not important.

437
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,145
What makes you want to get out of here?

438
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,565
It's awful being in this wicked town.

439
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,517
I won't spend another night here.

440
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,444
There must be someplace better
in this world.

441
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,818
I've seen better places, boy.

442
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,650
Then it's all right?
You'll take me with you?

443
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,781
I'm not leaving.

444
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,534
I'm staying right here.
You better make other plans.

445
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,332
I'm sorry.

446
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:36,046
- What's your name, boy?
- Evan!

447
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,965
Evan!

448
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,134
Evan!

449
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,881
Evan!

450
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,861
Evan! Evan!

451
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,323
What's goin' on?

452
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,526
Just look what Evan did
to my beautiful clothes!

453
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,361
Your son just ruined all the beautiful
things you got me in Denver.

454
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,322
Your son, he is a monster.

455
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,625
He'll end up hanging from a tree,
like those dead bandits out in front.

456
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,623
Calm down.
I'll buy you lots of new clothes.

457
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,751
No, even if you did, you know
the same thing would happen.

458
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,299
I wish you wouldn't blame Evan.
You know it isn't his fault.

459
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,968
Not his fault? He hates me
and I can't make you see it!

460
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,886
Calm yourself. I'll punish him for it.

461
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,714
Evan. Evan!

462
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,215
Evan!

463
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,306
Come here. Come here.

464
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,410
Help me cut 'em down.

465
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,750
We'll help you do your duty.

466
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:06,303
The spirits of these outlaws have to go free.

467
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,969
They have waited all through the night.

468
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:14,433
The desert cools after sundown,
and the nights are cold.

469
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,662
Now will you tell us?

470
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,419
Tell you what?

471
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,916
How is death.

472
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:25,671
We heard that there are
a great many wild beasts to hunt.

473
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:30,471
They tell us the pastures are full of
buffalo and the land is green and fertile.

474
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:33,846
Hey, you!
Who told you to cut those men down?

475
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,722
Did you hear that?

476
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,148
We want those outlaw killers to hang there...

477
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:46,980
...as a reminder to strangers
not to try and disobey our orders.

478
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,612
You be warned by that.

479
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:51,988
Did you hear that?

480
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,866
Better be careful,
and nothing will happen to you.

481
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,539
Take his advice, stranger!

482
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,504
Here's your $500. Take it.

483
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,250
Now get out of town.
We don't like folks we don't know here.

484
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:10,758
Make things easy, stranger.

485
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,338
Go while the going's good.

486
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:29,739
Um, you see, we got problems, my friend.

487
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,282
Uh, even up in... heaven.

488
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:34,865
So you are in need of a horse.

489
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,348
Quick! Catch the black one!

490
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,266
No. No, no. The brown.

491
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,613
Go with the wind!

492
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,979
No! No!

493
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,856
Let me go. Please!
Please!

494
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,490
No.

495
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,749
- Oh, no!

496
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,668
You're hurting me!

497
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,502
Leave him alone!

498
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,628
Hey, you, stranger.

499
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,213
Come over here.

500
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:24,099
Do you know it's dangerous to stick your nose
in other people's business around here?

501
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,642
But it looked like fun,
so I thought I'd join in.

502
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,726
Fun's exactly what they were having.

503
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,857
They were just inviting him to a party

504
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,563
He's guest of honor.

505
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,194
He doesn't look anxious to go to your party.

506
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,706
That's the reason we asked him to come to it.

507
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,410
Why don't you come too?
I admire you for your gun play.

508
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,918
Though it's a pity you waste all that
gold every time you shoot somebody.

509
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,921
It's only on special occasions I use 'em.

510
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,970
How about listening
to a proposition I'll make you?

511
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,047
On my ranch there's room for a man like you.

512
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,474
Do you want to work for me?

513
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,347
Maybe I do.

514
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,724
Depends what you want done.

515
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,228
Tie him up tight.

516
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,901
There ain't no need
to be afraid of hurting him, Max.

517
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,274
- Pedro.
- Yeah, boss?

518
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:17,152
Take one of my fastest horses.

519
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,108
Pay a visit to his father.

520
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:23,822
Tell that idiot we want all the gold they
found on those outlaws that they hanged.

521
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,874
I am bargaining for the life of his son.

522
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,169
And you can tell him, Pedro,
I want it all soon.

523
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,372
I am anxious to make this deal.

524
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,206
Sure thing, boss.
Right away.

525
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,166
Boys, there'll be gold for all of you.

526
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,433
What do you think, my friend?

527
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:47,978
I am a great believer
in the affections of a father.

528
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,397
But while we're all waiting,
it'll be amusing...

529
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,474
...to entertain our handsome young guest.

530
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,022
Juanito!

531
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,114
Johnny, we are waiting to begin the party.

532
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,736
Yes, señor I'm bringing

533
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,454
Put it over here.

534
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,957
Why not sit down?
Go on, sit there.

535
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,589
Make yourself at home next to me, won't you?

536
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,881
You see what a good time
my boys have here?

537
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,513
Why don't you join them
in their entertainment?

538
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,261
Larry had a big piece. Get outta the way!
Let me at it!

539
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,230
Pick it off of the table, will ya?

540
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,985
Come on, drink up, eat something, and before
you know it, you'll feel you're one of us.

541
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,566
The pleasures of food and drink
satisfy men's baser senses...

542
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,902
...and open the way
to more refined sensation...

543
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,283
...like crime, for instance.

544
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,330
It don't seem right to me...

545
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,460
...you holdin' that kid here as a hostage.

546
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,163
I'd never have suspected you were a moralist.

547
00:56:56,246 --> 00:57:00,171
You must have broken the law sometime.

548
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,173
You handle a gun too good, stranger.

549
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,097
I have good reason to practice.

550
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,474
It's most unlikely
you got that kind of practice...

551
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,602
...being an honest, law-abiding man.

552
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,605
You'll have fun being a member of my gang.

553
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:21,359
It should be quite obvious.
Mira, amigo.

554
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,360
My muchachos are hardworking,
yet look what I give them...

555
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,696
...the best of everything, amigo.

556
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,781
You can see for yourself.

557
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,664
I taught them well to enjoy good things.

558
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:45,504
Tastes good.

559
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:12,164
If I have to pay the ransom for my son's life,
I think you should pay it too!

560
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,162
What have I got to do with it?

561
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:17,085
He's your son.
You'll pay with your share of the gold.

562
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,754
We're partners in
this, share the same secret.

563
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,457
You'll pay the ransom, not me.

564
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,508
My share is not enough.
They'll kill him.

565
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:27,053
Don't you see?
They're determined to get all of it.

566
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:30,349
Not my share of the gold.
That stays here.

567
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,177
The kid's not my responsibility.

568
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,978
I thought you were my partner.

569
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,772
I am your partner, Templer,
but the boy is yours.

570
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,350
My God, you're a rat.

571
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:42,107
You leave me be,
or I'll shoot you.

572
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,023
I'll make you pay.

573
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,496
Where are you?

574
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,074
Can't you make your
minds up quick about the gold?

575
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,086
Take it easy there.
What's your big hurry?

576
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,833
Help yourself
to as much as you want.

577
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,797
You can tell them they got five minutes...

578
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,680
...to m-make... their lousy minds up.

579
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,976
Did he agree?
No.

580
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,349
Wouldn't he give it you?
I couldn't make him see reason.

581
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,060
It was our chance
to get our hands on all of it, Bill.

582
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,941
You mean you'd let them kill the kid?

583
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,943
Bill, can't you see it's only a trick?
That's all!

584
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,491
They're just trying to scare you
into giving in to them.

585
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,988
I'm not going to risk that.

586
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,412
The trouble with you is,
you're weak as water.

587
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,957
You're being fooled into telling them you
managed to find the gold. Deny it, deny it!

588
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,831
Make them think
you don't have it, Bill.

589
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,257
Here's Pedro.

590
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:58,395
It's no good.
He says he doesn't have the gold.

591
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,472
He asked you to let the boy go!

592
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,352
I have a job for you, stranger.

593
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,525
You can carry this kid's corpse
back to his father.

594
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,030
Lex! You know what to do.

595
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,205
Uh,wait a minute.

596
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,286
I have an idea how he can be useful to us.

597
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,831
I'll get your gold.

598
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,793
You want to save the boy, don't you?

599
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,468
For the gold.

600
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,055
All right.

601
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,133
But you gotta win him.

602
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:43,061
You must first shoot that rope there,
the one that ties him to the wall.

603
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,738
I know you are an excellent shot,
so it should be easy for you.

604
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:54,493
But not so easy after you have drunk
what's left of this whiskey, mmm?

605
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,070
What about it?

606
01:01:56,296 --> 01:02:01,427
Now let's see, shall we,
just what kind of a man you are.

607
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:50,896
I'll handle this.

608
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:57,195
Very smart.
You surprise me, amigo!

609
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,861
Very smart indeed.

610
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:04,869
But you certainly should know better.
The boy is still tied.

611
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,950
I'll give him to you anyway.

612
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,957
Cut that cord!

613
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,134
Cheer up, boy.

614
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:20,885
If you want to please your father,
you should start playing at being dead.

615
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,969
Now your life is worth less
than the golden sand in the desert.

616
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,306
Well, what is this? A funeral?
Get on with the party.

617
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,089
Evan!

618
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,257
Evan!

619
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,971
Evan.

620
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,144
Who fired a gun?

621
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,901
On your feet!

622
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:27,943
He committed suicide
'cause there was no one standing guard.

623
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:30,245
Kid must have taken my gun.

624
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,539
Damn fool to do a thing like that.

625
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:36,915
I know how you must feel, stranger,
after you did your best to save his life.

626
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,709
He didn't want to be a man.
What do you mean?

627
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,210
A man who can take on responsibilities...

628
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:45,294
...a man who does what he must and accepts it.

629
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,014
I'd say he died a lot like a man.

630
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:52,513
My offer is still open to you, if you'll accept it.

631
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:56,472
Take him into town and get that father of his
to give me all the gold he's got hidden.

632
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,977
If he won't, he'll have visitors.

633
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:02,277
I'll go, but I don't think
it'll do any good anyway.

634
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,902
I think it will. It depends on you.
Pablo, saddle up a horse.

635
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,529
You see anyone?
Not yet.

636
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,452
Why don't they come?

637
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,849
Templer!
Well, what is it?

638
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,019
The stranger is bringing him in now.

639
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,524
What happened?
How is he?

640
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,823
You'd better prepare yourself, Templer.
It doesn't look good.

641
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,241
Florie!

642
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,910
Here they are.

643
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,038
Oh, my God.

644
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,936
Here. Come here.

645
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,783
Evan.

646
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,913
Take him.

647
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,873
Help me with him.

648
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,228
Come on.
Move away from that table.

649
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,892
Evan.Evan.

650
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,953
Evan, my son. Oh, God.

651
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,584
My poor boy.
What did they do to you?

652
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,749
Are you mad?

653
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,927
Get your hands off me!

654
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,857
What's up with him?

655
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:54,908
He must have gone out of his head not to
respect the feelings of a father for his son.

656
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,405
We gotta kick him out of here once and for all.

657
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:18,722
You've gotta give up that gold, Templer.

658
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,470
Or they'll come and get it.

659
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,029
You're letting him just walk out of here?

660
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:43,244
No, not now.
There are too many witnesses.

661
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:06,063
They do not know that you still have many
golden bullets to shoot from your gun.

662
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,060
Son, you must have much hate.

663
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,359
When you have finished all your bullets,
you will leave here.

664
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,353
We have an enemy in common,
you and I.

665
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,060
You know who I mean.

666
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:57,981
Templer is a man to beware of.
Be careful.

667
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:01,151
He's already threatened me with violence.

668
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:05,071
Say, come into my house.

669
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,327
This is where I live.

670
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,829
I didn't know there was a house in this town
where they welcomed guests.

671
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,414
My house is different.

672
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:18,502
If a stranger comes by, tired and
hungry, he's always welcome here.

673
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,550
Come on in, stranger.

674
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,301
How come you're so generous?

675
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,851
Because I'm scared.

676
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,682
I've been threatened.

677
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,438
You can protect us.

678
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,019
I must have protection.

679
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:37,987
I'll pay you.

680
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,445
I do everything myself.

681
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,030
I have no servants.

682
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,082
I don't trust them.

683
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,956
They steal things.

684
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:36,037
Too many good things here.

685
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,791
Eat up. I'm sure you're hungry.

686
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:45,631
I'll treat you special if you stay here.

687
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:49,513
You won't believe this,
but I treat everybody special.

688
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,516
You appear to live alone.
I feel like I do.

689
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,735
I've been unfortunate.

690
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,562
I almost wish I did.

691
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:04,274
I've seen a woman at the upstairs window.

692
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,366
You've seen her already?
Yeah.

693
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,115
She's my wife.

694
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,788
But she might as well not exist.

695
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,706
She's unbalanced.

696
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:14,705
You understand?
The girl is insane.

697
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,754
I've had to lock her in room, poor creature.

698
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:22,167
She wouldn't harm anyone.
She has the mind of a child.

699
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,468
If anything should happen to me...

700
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,921
Sorrow's men might come around,
and they're dangerous.

701
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,305
And imagine if Templer were to come here.

702
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,137
He's a man with
no religious principles whatsoever...

703
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,143
...a man without scruples or morals.

704
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,270
That's why the Lord struck down his son.

705
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:41,228
He lives with that woman openly
and they're not married.

706
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,317
It's a scandal everyone talks about.

707
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,945
Please say you'll protect us.

708
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,394
She is always like this.

709
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,471
There's nothing I can do.

710
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,534
We'd better find that stranger
and have him killed.

711
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,365
And find him before dawn.

712
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,372
And see about those two Indian men.

713
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,704
We'll have to find a reason to beat them up.

714
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:44,882
Do whatever you want, but I must be sure
he's dead as a doornail by tomorrow.

715
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,631
All right, boss, leave it to me.
I'll do it.

716
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,880
It's a good bed, this.

717
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,144
But you're not to fall asleep.

718
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:00,356
What's that?

719
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,864
Like this.
Don't turn it out.

720
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,987
I want you to rest, but stay awake.

721
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,740
I'm exhausted.

722
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:16,368
You can't stop me from going to sleep.

723
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,625
I'm getting up early tomorrow
morning and hitting the road.

724
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,047
Good night.

725
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,047
I said good night.

726
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,711
Hmm?

727
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:56,506
I knew I'd find you in here.

728
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,263
I heard voices and someone moving about.

729
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,594
Don't you recognize me?

730
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,896
Sure. I saw you at the window.

731
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:09,440
You didn't understand the signs I made to you.

732
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:12,234
What were you trying to tell me?

733
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,065
To get out. You're in danger.

734
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,196
You don't know
what the people are like here.

735
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,948
You're different from the others.

736
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:21,577
You mustn't stay here in this place.
I must try to save you.

737
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,125
What makes you think I'm in danger?

738
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,454
They'll try to murder you, I'm sure.

739
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,834
Life in this place is worth nothing.

740
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,416
Look at me.

741
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,642
Uh, what's your name?

742
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,219
Elizabeth.

743
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,315
He says you're crazy.

744
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,066
He's evil.

745
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,398
He wants me to think I'm mad...

746
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,654
...and he's nearly succeeded.

747
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:00,903
Why does he want to do that?

748
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,534
Because I fell in love...

749
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:08,711
...with someone fine...

750
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:12,086
...and I've been locked away here ever since.

751
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,962
Then you're not really mad.

752
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,590
I don't know.

753
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,548
What's the matter?

754
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,341
It's just...

755
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,098
...that I must have someone to love me.

756
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,561
He left your door unlocked.

757
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,610
Why did he do that?

758
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,492
Seems odd.

759
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:48,621
Because he wants me to make sure
you stay awake to defend his house.

760
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:51,329
Where's he gone?

761
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,916
Get out of here while there's time.

762
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,998
You haven't kissed me yet.

763
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,397
My love.

764
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:53,941
My love.

765
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,846
What's going on?

766
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:30,303
It's Sorrow's men!

767
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:33,731
Arm yourselves, all of you.
And wait at the windows. But don't shoot!

768
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,069
Open up, Templer!

769
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,988
Templer, if you don't open up this door,
we'll break it down!

770
01:21:42,106 --> 01:21:45,827
We've got to do something.
Hide the gold.

771
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,278
I know where to hide it.

772
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:49,489
Where?

773
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,245
Templer, you can't stop us!

774
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:56,830
Can you hear me, Templer?
We're not playing around. We're coming in!

775
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,586
All right, boys, break the door down!

776
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:08,762
You take care of the horses.

777
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:12,436
The rest of you, get up there
and break that door down.

778
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,610
Templer, we're coming in!

779
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:58,099
Have you no respect for the dead?

780
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,186
The saloon is closed.
We're in mourning here.

781
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,826
Listen to that.
Anybody’s think it was true.

782
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:12,155
You know what to do.
Search every corner of the house.

783
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,297
Well, Templer...

784
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,634
...are you gonna tell us
where you've hidden it...

785
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:15,968
...or do we kill you?

786
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,474
You're searching this place from top to bottom...

787
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,477
...and you can see the gold just ain't here.

788
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:21,978
It's been taken away.

789
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,901
It's been taken away
by that dirty rat Alderman.

790
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,650
You'll find it in his house.

791
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,106
If you're lying, Templer, watch out!

792
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:33,198
Quick! They're here! Save me.

793
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:34,995
Look. There they are.

794
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,786
Get away from the window.

795
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:41,414
Do something. That's why
you're here- to protect me.

796
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:47,086
What am I supposed to protect...

797
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:50,965
...your house, your reputation
or your poor wife?

798
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:53,513
Isn't there anything of greater value?

799
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:03,607
That's the house, all right.

800
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:06,936
Alderman, we're coming for the gold!
Your friend Templer gave you away.

801
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:10,068
We know you've got it, so let's have it
before we burn your house down.

802
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,578
Here it is. Take it. Give it to them,
my love, before they harm you.

803
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,079
You give that here!

804
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,706
You're mad!

805
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,207
You're mad!

806
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,039
Leave her alone!

807
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:35,389
Come on, Alderman! We know
you've got it in there! Open up!

808
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,682
Come on, Alderman!

809
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,024
There's somebody in the window.
We don't like waiting, Alderman!

810
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:51,776
Give us the gold!

811
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:57,240
It's the stranger!
Shoot him! Go on! Fire!

812
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:58,946
Get back.

813
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,751
Fire at that man!
Kill him!

814
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,796
Kill the stranger!

815
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:11,208
Get to the horses! Quick!

816
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:15,588
Get on your horses!

817
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:19,221
Come on!
Back off! Get on the horses!

818
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,791
Don't be afraid.

819
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,375
It's all over.

820
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,650
It's all right.

821
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,033
She's betrayed me.
A servant in my house.

822
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,406
No better than that damned half-breed.

823
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:23,409
I'll throw them both out together.

824
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,490
Then they'll find out who I am.

825
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,500
Can't I help you?

826
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,585
You should try to forget it.

827
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,088
Don't be so sad.

828
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:06,675
You know I love you.
I'm sure I can help.

829
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,523
Nobody can help me.

830
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,811
I've got to finish what I started.

831
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:20,689
I know.

832
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:23,525
I've always known that'd be your answer.

833
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,235
You'll leave me.

834
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,578
Where's my gun?

835
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,968
“I have given you the power...

836
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,300
...to walk upon serpents and scorpions...

837
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,887
...and to withstand the might of your
adversaries, whoever they may be.

838
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:57,352
Whosoever among you
shall say I am great, he shall be small...

839
01:29:57,434 --> 01:30:02,315
...and whosoever among you shall say
I am the first, he shall be the last.

840
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:06,652
For the Son of God came among you
not to be served, but to serve you...

841
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:10,456
...and he gave his life that you may live.”

842
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:13,249
All right, lower the coffin.

843
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:03,060
What a day.

844
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:09,616
Give me a drink, huh?

845
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,284
It's so hot.

846
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,152
Rotten thief.

847
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:52,234
Now you know what it costs to double-cross me.

848
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:55,745
That'll fix you and him at the same time.

849
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:03,211
He must have taken it while we were sleeping.
I want to know why.

850
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:06,294
I've gotta go find him.

851
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:09,876
What are you going to do
if the others come back to get the gold?

852
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:13,005
If you like...

853
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:15,177
I'll stay.

854
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:16,929
No. They'll kill you.

855
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:40,540
Don't worry.

856
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,285
Go.

857
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:46,588
And one day come back for me.

858
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:49,212
If you don't, I shall die.

859
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:54,428
Sure filled him full of holes.

860
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,972
Did a good job.

861
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,890
The stranger left his gun behind.

862
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,387
The chamber is empty.

863
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,972
I know this gun.
I'm sure I do.

864
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,729
Hey, wait a minute.

865
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,811
This bullet's solid gold.

866
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,241
It's the stranger's.

867
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:16,659
He murdered Templer.

868
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:17,986
Go get him.

869
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,117
Well, what are you waiting here for?

870
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,666
Florie. Where the devil is Florie?

871
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:26,244
Haven't seen her.
She's always been a bad woman.

872
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,295
I'm sure she's got something to do with this.

873
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:31,587
Better get going. And don't forget your guns.
Yeah, let's go. Come on!

874
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:45,146
Hey, mister! Hey!

875
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:47,565
You! Come here!

876
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,105
Listen.

877
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:56,987
I'm terrified.
I want you to help me.

878
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:58,534
They're gonna try to kill me.

879
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:01,534
Alderman has killed Bill.
It was awful.

880
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:03,240
But I managed to get away.

881
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:06,327
I saw him do it.
I saw him kill Bill Templer.

882
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:09,496
Where'd he do it?

883
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:13,049
In the saloon.
We'd just come back from the funeral.

884
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:17,129
N-Now he wants to kill me.
I'm in danger because I saw him do it.

885
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:20,056
I don't stand a chance in hell against Alderman.

886
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,350
He's a highly respected citizen.

887
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:24,974
He'll have me killed
and make it seem legal.

888
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:31,101
Would you like to get rich?

889
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:36,652
What do you mean by that?

890
01:35:39,484 --> 01:35:42,033
Just exactly what do you want me to do?

891
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:45,661
I know where he hid the gold.
All- All of Templer's.

892
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,744
If you'll help me to get it, we can split it.

893
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:52,171
Where is it?
At the cemetery.

894
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:53,464
In Evan's coffin.

895
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:56,088
I haven't the courage to get it myself,

896
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,671
...but there's enough gold in there
to do things that-

897
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:04,851
Listen here. If anyone tries to open
that boy's coffin, I'll see they get shot.

898
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:08,934
Haven't you done enough?

899
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,981
That gold belongs to Evan.

900
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:13,185
But we have to have it to leave this place.

901
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,521
And we've got to get out
before they kill us.

902
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:18,607
Your life's in danger as well as mine.

903
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,667
What do you think of this baby?
Not bad!

904
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:45,225
Looks like Alderman's getting anxious.

905
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,018
All right.
If you're ready, let's go.

906
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:48,640
Come on!

907
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:51,648
Now we'll see some action!

908
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:54,146
You heard him.
Get going.

909
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:58,025
If you want to sleep safe in your beds,
find those two...

910
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:01,779
...and make sure they do no more harm in our town.

911
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:28,893
Hey, there's
a friend of his here.

912
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:30,595
Who? The stranger?

913
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:36,481
Oh, those Indians.
They always hang around with him.

914
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,524
Hey. Anyone knows where he is,
they ought to.

915
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,484
Let's make them talk.
Come on, huh?

916
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:47,453
Let me get my hands on them.
Well, come on.

917
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:59,545
On your knees! You dog!

918
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:03,299
Don't shoot.
It would be a shame.

919
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:06,052
I've always wanted a scalp.

920
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:43,797
Done!
A perfect success!

921
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:47,096
Well done. Aren't I
a good hairdresser?

922
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:49,765
- You're a real pro!
- I heard him go “plop”!

923
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:00,894
Hurry! They're looking for you.
They want to kill you.

924
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:02,986
Where's your friend?
They killed him.

925
01:39:17,493 --> 01:39:19,086
Give me that rifle!

926
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:40,309
Hold it, stranger!
You can't get away this time!

927
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:53,405
Now you'll have to answer to Mr. Sorrow.

928
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:17,187
Where is he?
What have you done?

929
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,309
Your precious lover boy is dead.

930
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:22,483
Sorrow's men took him away
and tortured him to death.

931
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,523
I thought you'd be pleased to hear that.

932
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:27,113
I'll deal with you later.

933
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:33,281
Get in.

934
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:38,124
You'll never get out of there alive.

935
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:41,411
Hold it!

936
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:44,043
We don't want him unconscious.

937
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:58,891
I'm gonna tell you something.

938
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:02,019
You've been very stupid
not to take advantage of my offer...

939
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:04,021
...to make you one of my muchachos.

940
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,102
We could have been amigos.

941
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:09,485
But you preferred to go
your own way, didn't you?

942
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:12,238
You're gonna tell me
where that gold's hidden.

943
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,035
You'll tell me,
if I have to cut your tongue out.

944
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:16,738
You made a mistake.

945
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:19,498
How could you?

946
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:23,579
How could you make a mistake
as elementary as all that?

947
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:25,914
Now you're gonna have to pay.

948
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,716
Mr. Sorrow doesn't like to be cheated.

949
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:33,171
Carlos, go prepare our persuasive little pets.

950
01:41:35,965 --> 01:41:39,845
We have to get going,
but you won't find it lonely.

951
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:42,931
I'm gonna make sure
you have nice company.

952
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:46,109
What do you like, the company of snakes...

953
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:48,436
...or blood-sucking vampire bats?

954
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:51,656
Rats can also be good company.

955
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:54,655
You won't feel lonely.

956
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:56,987
Now I'll wish you good night.

957
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,616
Come on.

958
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:04,331
It's useless, Sorrow.

959
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:07,296
You can't scare me.

960
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:09,715
You'll never get me to tell you.

961
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:13,549
You don't know me.

962
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,552
We'll see. We'll see.

963
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:19,976
I've made stronger men than you
tell me everything.

964
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:22,725
You'll change your ideas soon.

965
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,601
Come on, Carlos.

966
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,559
Sleep easy.

967
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:04,410
Carlos! Willy! Nico! Miguel!

968
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:05,785
You can get going!

969
01:44:05,865 --> 01:44:08,618
We know now
where the gold has been hidden.

970
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:12,706
Our prisoner has at last
been persuaded to talk.

971
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,872
The cemetery.

972
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:50,668
The cemetery. The cemetery.

973
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:55,753
Having a good time with your friends, amigo?

974
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:58,050
Interesting, ain't it?

975
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,048
It's better than any party.

976
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:02,471
The cemetery.

977
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:04,139
The cemetery.

978
01:45:10,888 --> 01:45:12,390
Don't you want a drink?

979
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:16,478
If everything goes according to plan,
they'll be back before dawn.

980
01:45:58,185 --> 01:45:59,937
How did you get in here?

981
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:03,024
You don't think
this is just for playing music.

982
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:09,739
That's right, Corporal.
Go for the throat!

983
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:12,450
Gimme a drink!

984
01:46:13,784 --> 01:46:15,081
A drink!

985
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:17,955
A drink!

986
01:46:29,633 --> 01:46:32,512
All right, you dirty old drunk!

987
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:38,647
It's a pity you don't understand
what my muchachos mean to me.

988
01:46:40,895 --> 01:46:44,650
They make me so happy
in their black uniforms.

989
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:53,158
Drink, you feathered sponge!

990
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:56,918
You like.

991
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:59,213
More! I want more!

992
01:47:01,874 --> 01:47:05,549
Damn it, there's nothing in here!
We've been tricked!

993
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:08,552
But it must be here.
We've got to find that gold!

994
01:47:10,215 --> 01:47:12,138
Go on.
What are you waiting for?

995
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:13,764
Open up every grave!

996
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:16,347
Get going.
Dig, damn it, dig!

997
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:20,435
We've got to find it! If we have to,
tear up every grave in this cemetery!

998
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:23,737
Dig, damn it!
Hurry up! Find that gold!

999
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:30,035
Get your backs into it!

1000
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:32,363
Hurry up!

1001
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:34,119
Come on! Let's go!

1002
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:53,611
We need explosives.

1003
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:58,407
Here.
Take as much as you can carry.

1004
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:03,332
Come on. Hurry up.

1005
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:17,552
♪♪ Here. Take this.
They're coming back.

1006
01:49:27,478 --> 01:49:28,775
Come on. Let's go.

1007
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:48,632
Here they come! Go!
Hyah! Hyah! Hah!

1008
01:49:50,042 --> 01:49:52,465
Hey, that's Sorrow's horse!
Where?

1009
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:01,853
Come on!

1010
01:50:04,223 --> 01:50:06,567
Get outta here! Come on!

1011
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:23,743
The time has come, Sorrow!

1012
01:50:23,826 --> 01:50:25,920
The time has come, Sorrow!

1013
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:30,962
It's time! it's time!

1014
01:50:37,214 --> 01:50:38,887
The time has come!

1015
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:42,307
Too late!

1016
01:50:42,386 --> 01:50:44,434
Too late. Too late.

1017
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:47,228
Damn you.

1018
01:51:01,947 --> 01:51:03,949
Missed me! Missed me!

1019
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,642
Elizabeth!

1020
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,113
Elizabeth!

1021
01:52:48,929 --> 01:52:51,728
Whole darned building's in ﬂames!

1022
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:56,187
It's gone too far.
We can't stop this now.

1023
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:01,321
I hope there's no one inside!

1024
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,323
If there is, we'd better get 'em out quick.

1025
01:53:03,402 --> 01:53:05,200
Move yourself!
Come on!

1026
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:10,125
We must pray!

1027
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,500
Get down, all of you, and pray!
Can't you?

1028
01:53:13,578 --> 01:53:15,922
What a shame.
It was a beautiful place.

1029
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:17,625
Proud of it, wasn't he?

1030
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:18,880
He sure was.

1031
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:22,509
But there ain't no point
in having a house that burns like this is.

1032
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,510
I wouldn't give you two bits for it.

1033
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:18,151
Look there! It's all gold!

1034
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:17,331
I'm uglier than you!
