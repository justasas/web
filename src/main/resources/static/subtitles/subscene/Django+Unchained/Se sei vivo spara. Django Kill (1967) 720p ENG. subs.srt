1
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,842
Gold!

2
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,725
My gold.

3
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,088
My gold.

4
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,651
You won't get far, Oaks.

5
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,921
You won't get far.

6
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,920
<i>Relax, hombre.</i>

7
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,802
- The water.
- Relax, hombre.

8
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,489
So much gold for everyone, at the river.

9
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
Come on, take your clothes off!

10
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,368
Come on down!

11
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,245
You swim like a bastard.

12
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,324
Quit it! Stop joking around, you idiots!

13
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,442
The Mexicans are attacking us!

14
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,124
The guns,Joe! The guns!

15
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,123
<i>Adelante!</i>

16
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,801
Let's not waste any time.
Hurry up! Get it down.

17
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,405
Help me.

18
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,848
Come on, hurry up.

19
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,569
<i>Hombre!</i>

20
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,201
- Whiskey and women forever!
- Tequila, you mean.

21
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,126
- I'll buy you a ranch.
- More gold than in the Virgin's statue.

22
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,649
- Hug me, Miguel!
- I'll give you a kiss, <i>hermanol</i>

23
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,081
Nice things have to be earned.

24
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,925
This gold will last a lifetime.

25
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,486
When luck presents itself,
you have to grab it.

26
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,362
What a huge heist.

27
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,488
Oaks, what are you doing?

28
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,927
Talking to yourself?

29
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,970
Hey, listen.
Shouldn't we divvy up the loot?

30
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,203
I want to be in Mexico by nightfall.

31
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,682
I was talking to myself
about how huge this heist was.

32
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,445
Sure, we all did it together.

33
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,650
It was more of a party among friends.
Lots of gold, lots of laughter.

34
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,650
But it's time to divvy it up.

35
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,327
Don't you agree?

36
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,883
Divvy it up with whom?

37
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,845
The desert sun is messing with Oaks's head
like tequila on an empty stomach.

38
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,721
He says he doesn't know
who to divvy up the gold with.

39
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,486
Did you hear that?
That's what he said.

40
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,483
Sure, they heard me.

41
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,483
They heard me.

42
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,246
I've traveled too far to put my hands
on these bags of gold.

43
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,085
I've had to withstand the stench
of your greasy skin.

44
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,528
We're not divvying up gold
with any dirty Mexicans.

45
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,326
Stick 'em up!

46
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,686
<i> Qué pasa?</i>

47
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,043
You too.

48
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,847
Hands in the air, greasy skin.

49
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,530
Shoot!

50
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,285
Don't let him get away!

51
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,282
Shoot!

52
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,169
it's not loaded, half-breed.

53
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,928
Like all bastards, you're not that smart.

54
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,925
Always working.

55
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,129
Always working
with a pickax and a shovel.

56
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,282
That's our destiny.

57
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,885
That's right.
A nice big grave for the lot of you.

58
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,930
You can play dice underground.

59
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,767
Am I right, boss?

60
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,370
Killing us without even offering us
a glass of tequila first.

61
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,488
It's just not right.

62
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,771
Aren't you glad? You'll be able
to speak your Spanish for all eternity.

63
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,320
No gringos will be there to stop you.

64
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,768
You can have a nice chat with the devil!

65
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,771
What about you, half-breed?
What will you speak?

66
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,285
English or Spanish?

67
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,603
I've never made such distinctions
with my friends,

68
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,569
and you know it.

69
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,369
You're a pig!

70
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,048
I've never felt closer to you,

71
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,130
with all the gold you're leaving me.

72
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,649
It's so hot.
We need some water.

73
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,366
What are you doing?
Don't let him get away!

74
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,611
The horses!
He's hamstringing the horses!

75
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,127
Get him! Quick, run!

76
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,841
- He's ruining the horses.
- Run, quick!

77
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,209
<i>Bravo, muchacho.</i>

78
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,004
Run! What are you waiting for?

79
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,969
Catch him!

80
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,530
Help the horses!

81
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,841
Wait! Don't shoot!

82
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,888
They're getting away!

83
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,243
You won't get far without the horses, Oaks!

84
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,403
Go the other way, Charlie!
The other way!

85
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,926
Don't let the horses escape!

86
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,848
Hurry. We're wasting time.

87
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,003
- Now we're really in trouble.
- We have to hurry.

88
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,442
- I have a bad feeling, Charlie.
- I say we mow them down.

89
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,967
You won't get far, Oaks!

90
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,331
Fire!

91
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,129
Here's your gold.

92
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,766
Yes, it's your gold,
the gold you died for.

93
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,808
We made bullets out of it.

94
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,087
It's deadlier than lead.

95
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,722
Now that you've seen the fire of death,
this is the only use you'll have for gold.

96
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,121
We will stay with you and serve you,

97
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,568
but you must tell us
about the green pastures you've seen

98
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,449
and from which you have returned.

99
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,285
You, who have seen them
in the blinding light of death,

100
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,764
you must tell us about the great herds,
about our people, our great dead chiefs.

101
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,721
You will tell us about all this,
and we will follow and serve you.

102
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,845
No, Uncle!

103
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,287
Stop!

104
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,765
You're a bastard!

105
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,081
Bastard!

106
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,405
Get a load of this place.

107
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,208
What a shithole.

108
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,482
This is a strange place.

109
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,682
Let's not stop here, Oaks.

110
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,527
Where are we going to go without horses?

111
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,321
What are we going to eat?
The stones in the desert?

112
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,080
I'm hungry, guys-

113
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,369
And when I'm hungry, guys,
I'm not afraid of anyone.

114
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,930
I'm too hungry to be scared.

115
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,082
You're right, Pat. lt's just a town.

116
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,931
There's nothing to be scared of.

117
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,163
Who said anything about being scared?

118
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,483
It's just that maybe
we're not far enough away yet.

119
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,642
From what?

120
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,369
This is our path.
We've made our choices.

121
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,923
You stay here with the horses
and don't move for any reason.

122
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,809
You guys, go to the general store.

123
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,885
Tean, Woody, Charlie,
take care of the horses.

124
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,528
You two, come with me.

125
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,846
Good afternoon, hombres.
You've got a lovely town here.

126
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,890
It's my first time in these parts,
but I'm rarely wrong.

127
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,046
I can tell you're all nice people.

128
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,163
Do any of you have some horses for sale?

129
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,084
We're on our way up north,
and we find ourselves without horses.

130
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,243
The few horses we had...

131
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,888
just gave out on us.

132
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,088
So I thought, “Let's stop here.”

133
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,206
And here we are.

134
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,246
What are you waiting for, Norton?
Play your hand.

135
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,446
There.

136
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,809
Two pair, aces high.

137
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,282
I don't know why a man
with no horse would be laughing.

138
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,728
Cut it out, Evan.

139
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,801
We have horses,
but they're expensive around here.

140
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,327
Don't worry, boss.

141
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,802
We work hard, and we have money.

142
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,369
- Whiskey for everyone.
- Give it here.

143
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,965
I hope it's quality stuff.

144
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,280
You look like you've come a long way.

145
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,204
When you're looking for work,
it's worth the trip...

146
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,328
if the pay is good.

147
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,401
Yeah.

148
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,087
These days, it's good
to meet people who have work.

149
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,640
One look at guys like you is enough.

150
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,482
You can tell immediately
that you're really good guys.

151
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,607
You sure have a lot of dust on you.
You've crossed the desert.

152
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,561
You took the toughest road
to get to this place.

153
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,010
All the better for you.
You'll make money on the horses.

154
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,484
A business deal is like a card game.

155
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,091
Well, boss, we're in a hurry.

156
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,289
I told you, horses are expensive.

157
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,561
What, don't you like it?

158
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,927
It's what they paid us with.

159
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,250
- How many horses do you need?
- Nine.

160
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,130
Do you have more gold?

161
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,362
Of course.

162
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,771
I'll get them for you.

163
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,131
Richie, play something for these folks.

164
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,924
Flory!

165
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,844
What are you waiting for?
Come downstairs.

166
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,526
Our guests have come a long way.
They want to enjoy themselves.

167
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,285
- Let them hear your voice.
- Come on, let's hear it.

168
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,522
Put us in a good mood.

169
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,881
- She's pretty, isn't she?
- Very sophisticated.

170
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,803
And what a voice.

171
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,604
- Anything else?
- No, I think that will do.

172
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,127
Let's see what we have so far.

173
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,410
- I see you got a lot of food.
- We have a long way to go.

174
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,562
We're going north to work.

175
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,646
Jerky, beans, coffee, sugar.

176
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,250
Give us ten boxes of bullets, twelve gauge.

177
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,845
Ten boxes?

178
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,446
If you're going hunting,
you won't find enough game.

179
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,161
- Oh, we'll find it.
-just a moment.

180
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,322
I'll be right back.

181
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,247
- What is it?
- They're thieves, and they've got gold.

182
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,082
Scott, let's go.
That's everything.

183
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,730
Hang on. I'm tying the bags.

184
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,485
We have to join the others.

185
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,766
Oaks, listen.

186
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,890
Don't you think
it's a little too dark in here?

187
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,724
Idiot!

188
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,771
We're still dazed from the desert sun.

189
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,844
Don't move.
You're still weak.

190
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,967
But I feel fine.

191
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,251
My wounds are healed.

192
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,971
Can't we go any faster?

193
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,169
The horse is old. He's in no hurry.

194
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,684
Then we'll never catch up with them.

195
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,444
Hungry, thirsty men
without horses can't run far.

196
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,363
They'll have to stop.

197
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,727
There's a town up ahead.

198
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,924
Is it far?

199
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,250
No, it's just beyond those mountains,
where the desert ends.

200
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,128
What's the town called?

201
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,727
I don't know what white men call it.

202
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,369
Our people used to call it “The Field of Anguish.”

203
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,050
Come with me.
<i> Vamos, hombres! </i>

204
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,124
- Hurry up! No one can get away!
- Come on, all together!

205
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,124
- What are you waiting for?
- They're shooting.

206
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,009
Hurry UP!

207
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,690
- Shoot! Shoot!
- He's on the roof!

208
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,010
- Don't let him get away!
- Quick!

209
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,487
- There he is!
- Careful!

210
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,642
Shoot! Shoot!

211
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,441
- There's another one!
- Get him!

212
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,402
- Got him!
- We got him!

213
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,882
- Good going, Larry!
- Don't let him get away!

214
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,282
- Hold him down!
- Go on, Larry!

215
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,249
Watch out!

216
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,560
- Let's give it to him.
- Give it to him good!

217
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,726
Don't let him go!

218
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,487
Help!

219
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,211
Hold him down!

220
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,009
- There he is.
- Down here!

221
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,282
- This way.
- Get him!

222
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,690
- Got him!
- Run!

223
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,161
- The rope!
- Here it is.

224
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,528
- Hold him tight.
- Your days are over, grandpa!

225
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,365
To the gallows!

226
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,966
You can stop yelling.
It's all over for you.

227
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,691
- Where shall we hang him?
- Near the watering trough.

228
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,127
Let's not waste time.

229
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,009
There are others.

230
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,765
He's hit! We hit him.

231
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,362
He's still alive.

232
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,411
What are you waiting for, Hawkins?

233
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,806
Hold him. Don't let go.
He's dangerous.

234
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,327
- You should have cut your beard.
- Here's a good, thick rope.

235
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,971
- Hold him!
- He won't cooperate.

236
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,884
Go on, boy, Pray!

237
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,409
- Pull!
- Assassin! Thief!

238
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,802
- You're done running around.
- Murderer.

239
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,405
Let's put him with the others.

240
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,962
Here, Slim!
Show him how it's done.

241
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,929
- Do a nice job
- A clean job.

242
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,287
You're through scaring good people.

243
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,603
Good, Slim, very nice.

244
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,569
Have mercy.

245
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,291
- Give me my cigar.
- Make him happy.

246
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,442
- Ready, Billy?
- Ready for justice!

247
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,682
What are you waiting for?

248
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,568
- Come on!
- All together!

249
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,205
Once more.

250
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,045
- I like how they swing.
- I bet they enjoy it too.

251
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,770
This is a town of honest people.

252
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,883
There's no room for thieves and murderers!

253
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,045
- Come on, keep going.
- Pull!

254
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,769
Enough.
That's enough.

255
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,128
Watch out for the blood.
He's dripping like a pig.

256
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,322
Look! They're still moving.

257
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,643
- They're thick-skinned.
- That's because they're devils.

258
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,484
Murderers! Thieves!

259
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,723
There can be no mercy for you in this town!

260
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,929
It's the hand of God that's striking you down!

261
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,808
- Look, he's dancing a jig.
- Get your accordion, Slim.

262
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,327
- Get a load of their faces.
- They look like fish out of water.

263
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,402
- There's another one!
- He's their leader!

264
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,529
- Don't let him get away!
- Let's go!

265
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,086
<i>-</i> Come on!
- Let's get him!

266
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,165
There he is!

267
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,490
Come on, boys!

268
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,522
Let's get him!

269
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,850
Stop!

270
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,649
Don't challenge the ire of honest men.

271
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,688
- Surrender!
- Watch out! Get down!

272
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,002
Let's end this. isn't there anyone
with some guts around here?

273
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,242
500 dollars to whoever kills him.

274
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,290
Watch out, Lister!

275
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,084
He killed him!

276
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,403
Don't do it, Pat!

277
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,209
Watch out!

278
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,528
What are you doing, stranger?

279
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,443
Do you want to get killed?

280
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,965
500 dollars!

281
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,005
Damn them. I can't see.

282
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,211
Be careful, stranger.

283
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,000
No, it can't be him.

284
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,729
It can't be.

285
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,850
Go away!

286
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,723
Whoever you are, go away!

287
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,049
Where did you come from? Hell?

288
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,961
Go away!

289
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,611
I'm not dead like you!

290
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,042
What are you waiting for?
If you're not a ghost, shoot!

291
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,884
Shot!

292
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,804
He shot him full of lead.

293
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,803
- Yet he's still alive.
- Even better.

294
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,362
- He's in really bad shape.
- Sometimes it's better to be dead.

295
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,410
You're a good shot, stranger,
but you're a real butcher.

296
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,649
You really got him good.
You earned your 500 dollars.

297
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,688
Let's string him up with the others.

298
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,570
Give us a hand.
Lift him up. Grab his legs.

299
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,130
Wait a minute.

300
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,680
Wait, I said.
Put him down.

301
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,522
This man interests me.
I want him alive.

302
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,203
He has something to tell me.
There's plenty of time to hang him.

303
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,080
Why spare him? He's going
to end up on the gallows anyway.

304
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,642
- Pancho!
- At your service, Mr. Sorrow.

305
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,803
You're the expert. Take the lead
out of him and give him to me alive.

306
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,885
Come on, boys.
Help me get him out of here.

307
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,763
I wanted to hang him now.

308
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,447
- Mercy is not always a virtue.
- Who said anything about mercy?

309
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,602
I have some information on these men.

310
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,524
They're ruthless tramps,
thieves and murderers.

311
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,489
We know.
We've done our duty.

312
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,406
- They were hiding something under their rags.
- Sure, a depraved soul.

313
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,006
And we brought them to justice.

314
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,609
As far as I'm concerned,
you can have your justice.

315
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,365
I'm looking for something else.
Come with me, Willie.

316
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,284
He will talk.
And if not, someone else will.

317
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,842
- We're at your service, Mr. Sorrow.
- You'd better be.

318
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,367
Meanwhile, let's see what miracles
our friend Pancho can perform.

319
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,244
<i>Herman 0.</i>

320
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,964
Hermano, we'd like to know
whether we're staying or leaving.

321
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,921
- I think I'll stay.
- We knew it.

322
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,208
Here. Give him something to drink.

323
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,408
Drink. it's good for your hair.

324
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,007
Pancho, you must save him.
I have no use for his corpse.

325
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,321
I'll do my best, Mr. Sorrow.

326
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,330
Go on. Do it.

327
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,687
Stop screaming.
It's just a scratch.

328
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,086
Keep going, Pancho. Hurry up.

329
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,608
He'll be better in no time, right?
And he'll be eager to tell us his life stow.

330
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,727
A horrific story full of crime and murder.

331
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,610
I don't want to hear it.
I'll leave.

332
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,001
I love autobiographical memoirs.

333
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,287
I can't wait to hear it.

334
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,682
I hope the word of good citizens like us

335
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,003
will carry a lot more weight
than the lies of a criminal.

336
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,969
No, Templer.

337
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,931
I'll have my usual raspberry syrup drink.

338
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,929
Good for you, Pancho. You got it.

339
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,128
He's as good as a real doctor.

340
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,730
- But this is gold
- Gold?

341
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,802
- Gold?
- Gold!

342
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,090
Hold him, Larry!

343
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,603
- Get the knife!
- What are you doing?

344
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,205
Stand back.

345
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,044
Back!

346
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,966
What have you done, you idiot?
You killed him.

347
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,489
Forgive me, Sorrow. I've searched for gold
in vain my whole life, and he's full of it.

348
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,643
- It's true.
- He's full of gold, Mr. Sorrow.

349
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,210
A golden bullet.

350
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,841
Someone must be joking with us.

351
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,241
Why? isn't he dead?

352
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,250
Gold is an infallible way to kill someone.

353
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,288
No doubt about it, he's dead.

354
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,250
But he's an expensive dead guy
for any gunslinger.

355
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,687
Thirty bucks a pop.

356
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,047
An investment with a good return.

357
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,084
I think I've earned my 500 dollars,
right, Mr. Templer?

358
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,970
What? 500 dollars?

359
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,725
- Since when are you so generous?
- It's not for me.

360
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,408
- It's for the public good, Mr. Sorrow.
- Weeds must be killed at all costs.

361
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,328
You mustn't value gold much
if you use it for bullets.

362
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,243
Gold has its uses.

363
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,051
Here are your 500 dollars, stranger...

364
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,885
if this is what you came for.

365
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,481
Right now, what I need is a bed.

366
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,928
You can pay me tomorrow.

367
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,082
I'm in no rush.

368
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,531
- Is there a room for me, boy?
- Yes, sir, right away.

369
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,603
- He looks like he came from far away.
- Like all vagabonds do.

370
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,325
What should we do with this guy?

371
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,769
Listen to me, Templer.

372
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,640
In this town,
no one does anything for nothing.

373
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,530
You were in a hurry to kill them all,

374
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,682
and the stranger gave you a hand.

375
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,967
Now that guy can't talk.

376
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,487
They were too dangerous.
We couldn't wait.

377
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,884
I'm not talking about them,
but about what they had.

378
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,809
A load of gold.

379
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,720
That's what I want,
not that stranger's bullets.

380
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,683
Come up with that gold!

381
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,406
I don't have time to waste!

382
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,088
You're ill informed, Sorrow.

383
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,164
Or maybe one of them got away.

384
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,924
My boys are sharp.

385
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,209
They keep their eyes open,
and all the land around here is mine.

386
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,329
Nothing happens without my knowledge.

387
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,164
Hagerman is my witness.

388
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,410
I'm not the witness.
It is the Lord above who guided us.

389
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,968
We'll make him talk.
We'll make him talk.

390
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,764
Come on.

391
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,127
Here, look.

392
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,567
He signed with an “X”.

393
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,567
Why didn't you give him his money
and send him away?

394
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,490
He didn't want it.
He wanted to sleep.

395
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,163
Do you hear that?

396
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,730
He's not sleeping at all.

397
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,928
He's been pacing all this time.

398
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,844
Tomorrow <i>I'll</i> pay him, and he'll leave.

399
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,970
What about us?
Please, don't be weak.

400
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,840
- You have what you always wanted.
- Don't worry. I'll be ruthless.

401
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,365
Finally, we'll get married.
I'm tired of being your mistress.

402
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,125
Of course, we'll get married.

403
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,290
- Will you sleep with me tonight?
- No, not tonight.

404
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,643
I'm busy.

405
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,525
Listen.

406
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,887
He stopped pacing.

407
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,563
I should get twice as much as you.

408
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,325
- Are you crazy, Templer?
- But I discovered the gold.

409
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,449
Who helped you hide the bags?
Who caught the mules?

410
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,761
- I could have asked someone else.
- Oh, really?

411
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,282
What about all the money I've loaned you
over the years that you've never paid back?

412
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,048
Hagerman, I've made investments
that benefited the whole community.

413
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,726
You more than anyone, with your business.

414
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,164
I transformed this hellhole
into a prosperous, civilized town.

415
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,766
Besides, I've always paid you the interest.

416
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,684
Well, I have my merits too.

417
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,650
I've always defended our morals,
and you know it.

418
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,725
I've never tired of preaching
the fear of God and the law.

419
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,966
But we're not talking about merit.

420
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,609
In equal shares.

421
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,730
Or do you want a fight,
and I'll send Sorrow's men after you?

422
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,768
Blackmailer! Thief!

423
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,963
Don't insult me, Templer,
or you'll regret it.

424
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,805
You're a cockroach.
I can't wait to crush you.

425
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,009
Equal shares, I said!
Equal shares!

426
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,050
- I disagree.
- I don't care if you disagree.

427
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,567
This gold belongs to both of us,
and I won't be extorted by you.

428
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,130
We'll see about that.

429
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,209
Do you dare to threaten me?

430
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,248
- You're not getting anything.
<i>-</i> I'm taking my share.

431
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,368
- We haven't decided what your share is.
- Yes, we have.

432
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,330
- Leave it.
- You can't stop me. it's mine too.

433
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,402
- I said, leave it.
- I want what's mine.

434
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,289
Nothing is yours.

435
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,930
Who is it?

436
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,248
- May I come in, sir?
- What do you want?

437
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,002
I have a favor to ask you.

438
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,560
You woke me up.

439
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,609
- Is it full daylight?
- Yes, sir.

440
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,201
Well, what is it?

441
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,444
Aren't you going to say anything?

442
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,683
I want to ask you to take me with you.

443
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,930
With me?

444
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,527
- Where?
- Anywhere.

445
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,891
You've reminded me
that I'll have to go somewhere too,

446
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,281
but I don't know where.

447
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,729
You're good with a gun.

448
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,167
You can go wherever you want.
Take me with you.

449
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,403
Guns are useless, kid.

450
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,407
- Why do you want to leave?
- I don't want to stay in this house.

451
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,007
Or in this town. There must be
someplace better in the world.

452
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,087
Yes.

453
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,811
A few times, I've seen someplace better.

454
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,645
Well? Please, take me with you.

455
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,927
I can't.

456
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,641
I have to stay here,
right here in this town.

457
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,768
I'm sorry.

458
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,529
What's your name?

459
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,322
Evan!

460
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,807
- What's going on?
- Look at what your son did to me!

461
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,287
All the new dresses
you brought me from Denver.

462
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,488
He hates me.

463
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,803
He's a criminal. He'll end up on the gallows
like those men out there.

464
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,123
- Calm down. I'll buy you more.
- I don't want them!

465
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,646
- You always forgive him.
- It's not all his fault.

466
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,042
- You hate him too, Flow.
- That's not true!

467
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,885
- <i>He</i> hates me!
- Calm down. I'll punish him.

468
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,881
Help me get them down.

469
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,330
We knew you wouldn't forget your brothers.

470
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,968
It is well done.

471
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,967
They've been complaining all night.

472
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,723
The air was cold last night.

473
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,645
So, will you tell us?

474
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,087
- What?
- What it's like on the other side.

475
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,324
You've been there. Is it true
that the great pasture is full of bison?

476
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,804
They say the pastures are free and rich,
and that there is no more fighting.

477
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,724
Hey, you!

478
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,962
Listen to me.

479
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,123
Who told you to cut down those corpses?

480
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,801
You think you can do
whatever you want? No, you don't.

481
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,201
We're in charge here,

482
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,611
not the first mangy vagabond who walks in.

483
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,160
They'll hang there until they fall to bits.

484
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,403
This is a town of gentlemen.
We like order.

485
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,689
They have to set an example
and rot on the gallows.

486
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,528
Here's your 500 dollars.
Take it.

487
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,642
Take my advice and get out.

488
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,007
We don't like strangers, all right?

489
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,801
We don't like Indians,
and we don't like strange people.

490
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,771
We're all family men,
and we like everything in its place.

491
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,605
We like wholesome living, so get out!

492
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,930
I'm talking to you.

493
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,323
The great pasture isn't free.

494
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,006
And there's fighting on the other side too.

495
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,889
Then you'll need a horse.

496
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,050
Run, muchacho ! Faster!

497
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,284
Run, run!

498
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,611
You can catch him!

499
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,607
The black one!

500
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,961
Well done, charro!
You caught him.

501
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,849
Quick, tighten the knot!

502
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,922
- Hold the horse, Sugar.
- Calm down, boy!

503
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,883
- Let me go!
- Don't let him get away!

504
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,288
- Where are the others?
- They're coming! Down there.

505
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,285
- Hold still, or else.
- What are you waiting for? Tie him up.

506
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,488
- Help!
- Damn horse! Hold him!

507
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,562
<i>Que pasa? </i>  Damn it!
- Stop him!

508
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,563
Hold the boy!

509
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,967
Everybody stop now! Let him go!

510
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,288
Hey, stranger!

511
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,689
Come here.

512
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,328
Want to know what the deadliest disease is?

513
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,687
Sticking your nose in other people's business.

514
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,047
I didn't think this was business.

515
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,284
- I thought this was a game.
- It is a game.

516
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,727
The muchacho is our guest.

517
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,850
We've invited him to a party.
It will be a nice family affair.

518
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,930
It's not easy to refuse your invitations.

519
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,807
Well, in that case, you're invited as well.

520
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,929
I saw you shooting in town.
You're a good shot.

521
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,287
You can't afford to waste much ammunition

522
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,966
with those expensive bullets.

523
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,046
- They're only for special occasions.
- We'll give you plenty of those.

524
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,043
If you're looking for work,
come to my ranch.

525
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,441
What do you say?

526
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,204
Why not?

527
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,721
We can always work something out.

528
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,970
Pull it tight.

529
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,203
Don't be afraid to hurt him.

530
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,091
- Pedro!
- Yes, sir.

531
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,006
Take a horse, as fast as you can.
Go and see his father at once.

532
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:23,688
Tell him I want all the gold he stole
from those stupid bandits he killed

533
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,842
in exchange for the life of his son.

534
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,491
All of it, down to the last ounce.

535
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,167
Run and tell him right away.
I'll be waiting to hear what he says.

536
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,004
Right away, sir.
A horse!

537
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,402
Muchachos, we'll all be rich!

538
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,528
What do you think, my friend?

539
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,968
I have faith in fatherly love.
He'll end up paying.

540
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:53,206
Meanwhile, our muchacho
will be the belle of the ball.

541
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,284
Jonathan!

542
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,366
What are you waiting for?
Where's our food?

543
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,204
Here it is. The food's ready.

544
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,046
- Finally!
- Beautiful!

545
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,043
- Good for you, Jonathan.
- Let me kiss it!

546
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,804
Get your knives.

547
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,284
Stop, behave yourselves.

548
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,850
You sit here, stranger.

549
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,890
I like you,
and I want you next to me.

550
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,966
See how I treat my muchachos?

551
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,611
Aren't you tempted to join us?

552
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,283
Come on, get back.

553
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,002
I want a thigh.

554
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,289
- Leave that piece to me.
- Give it here!

555
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,888
Eat and drink, and soon enough
you'll feel like one of us.

556
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,571
The pleasures of the table
open the door to the senses,

557
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,247
the senses to brotherhood
and brotherhood to manly actions.

558
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,687
I'd call them criminal actions.

559
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,490
Holding a mere boy prisoner-

560
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,484
ls there anything more manly than crime?

561
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,283
Don't tell me you haven't tried it.

562
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,330
You're too good with a gun.

563
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,089
Yes, I've had certain friends.

564
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,403
If you've committed
any half-decent crimes with them,

565
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,642
perhaps you understand me.

566
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,610
Eating, drinking
and contemplating your victim.

567
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,251
There's nothing more sensual.

568
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,444
You can count on that.

569
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,568
My boys can feel it.

570
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,449
I've taught them well.

571
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:30,809
Look at how greedily they eat,
how thirstily they drink,

572
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,726
and, mostly, how they look at the muchacho.

573
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,323
If I have to pay the ransom, so do you.
They've ta ken my boy.

574
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,768
What do I have to do with it?
Your son's yours, my gold's mine.

575
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,490
No one's touching my part.

576
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,484
We're bound by the same secret.
That's why we're partners.

577
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,570
- You have to pay too.
- No one has asked me for anything.

578
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,044
Bastard!
Would you have an innocent killed?

579
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,363
I'm not killing anyone.
It has nothing to do with me.

580
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,171
It's your problem,
just like in the Book of Ezekiel.

581
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,969
Don't bring the Bible into this.

582
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,010
Nothing has changed, Templer.
I'm not giving you my gold.

583
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,130
- Coward! Thief!
- Stop, Templer, or I'll knock you down!

584
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,521
You'll pay for this.

585
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,204
Where are you?

586
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,887
When am I going to get my answer?

587
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,122
Calm down.

588
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,124
Serve yourself.
I'll be right back.

589
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,841
When can I get my damn answer?

590
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,922
Sorrow is waiting!

591
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,808
Do you really want to make him mad?

592
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,131
- Well?
- Nothing.

593
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,925
- He didn't give you his part?
- No, he refused.

594
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,162
So you're the sap who pays up?

595
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,766
- Would you sacrifice an innocent?
<i>-</i> What innocent?

596
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,888
What do you think they'll do to Evan?
He's just a boy.

597
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,651
- They're just trying to scare you.
- You're willing to risk it?

598
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,166
They can't know for sure
that you have the gold, you idiot.

599
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,811
Should we give up our share
for a moment of fear?

600
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,851
Deny it! Deny it!
Never admit anything. Deny it.

601
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,484
Here he comes.

602
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,764
Nothing to be done, Mr. Sorrow.

603
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,241
He says he's desperate,
but he doesn't have the gold.

604
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,805
He says he never had it.

605
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,487
He's begging you to spare his son.

606
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,480
I have a job for you, stranger.

607
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,647
You'll take the muchacho's corpse to his father.

608
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,485
Lister! You kill him.

609
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,685
Just a minute.

610
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,762
I think I know how the boy
could be useful to us.

611
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,045
I'll take care of the gold.

612
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,771
You really care that much about the boy?

613
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,047
Do you care about the gold?

614
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,007
All right. All right.

615
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,441
But you have to earn the boy's life.

616
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,805
You have to break his ropes
with a single shot

617
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,689
from ten paces away.

618
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,084
But I'll give you a handicap,
like they do with horses that run too fast.

619
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,846
First, you have to guzzle
halfa bottle of whiskey in one swig.

620
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,610
Are you in?

621
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,525
I want to see if you're a good drinker
as well as a good shot.

622
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,921
Besides, the muchacho
is well worth a bender.

623
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,680
Quiet!

624
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,411
Drinking is like praying.
A man needs silence.

625
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,608
That's it. Keep going.

626
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,411
Well done. You did it.

627
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,404
Now you have to shoot from ten paces away.

628
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,610
Everybody freeze!

629
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,523
Stand still.

630
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,361
He broke your hand.
You let him get you, you fool.

631
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,686
All right.

632
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,567
I can respect a man who's quick.

633
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,689
The <i>muchacho</i> is yours.
You've earned him.

634
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,964
Untie him.

635
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,690
What are you waiting for?

636
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,321
Our friend just saved his life.
He can go on living.

637
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,649
You're in luck, boy.

638
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:22,248
If you'd had to count on your father,
you'd be dead by now.

639
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,489
Now your life is worth a golden bullet.

640
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,086
What's with the long faces?
Come on! it's a party!

641
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,882
What's going on?

642
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:07,968
Evan!

643
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,042
- Who fired that shot?
- I don't know, Mr. Sorrow.

644
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,805
It was a gunshot.
Come on! Wake up!

645
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,803
I can't find my shoes.

646
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,882
- Where did the shot come from?
- Outside.

647
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,361
From the stables, Mr. Sorrow.

648
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,764
What happened?

649
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,242
- It looks like a stupid accident.
- He was playing with my gun.

650
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,447
- This accident was intentional.
- I'm sorry for you, stranger.

651
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,922
Last night you saved his life,
but he gave up on becoming a man.

652
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,209
- What kind of man?
- A man willing to live without fear.

653
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,569
A man who never shies away from anything.

654
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,042
He chose darkness and silence.

655
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,484
The job I offered you is still open.

656
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,249
Take him back to his bastard father,
and tell him I want that gold he's hiding.

657
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,926
Or else my boys will soon
pay him another visit.

658
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,526
I'll take the boy, but I doubt
I'll be of much use to you.

659
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,843
I'm sure you will. it's in your interest.
Pablo, prepare his horse.

660
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,242
- Can you see anyone?
- Not yet.

661
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,926
Why is it taking them so long?

662
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,847
Well?

663
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,241
The stranger is bringing him.

664
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,971
- But what happened?
- I have friends up at Sorrow's ranch.

665
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,606
It seems that it was
a tragic accident, Templer.

666
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,444
My God, Flow.

667
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,522
He's here.

668
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,762
Go on. Take him.

669
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,650
Leave him.

670
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,885
Leave him.

671
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,043
Make room on the table.

672
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,247
- Calm down, Templer.
- My poor son.

673
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,845
I'm sorry.

674
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,283
- What's the matter with you?
- He was disgusted by such a father!

675
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,930
Hold him.

676
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,650
- Beat him up!
- Help me, Billy!

677
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,529
- What got into him?
- The stranger started it.

678
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,331
He has no respect
for a father's mourning.

679
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,449
- We should kick him out once and for all.
- That's right.

680
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,044
You'll have to give up that gold, Templer.

681
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,088
You'll have to give it up.

682
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,041
Are we going to let him leave,
just like that?

683
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,005
No, not now.
There are too many people.

684
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:06,049
They don't know you can't leave this town
as long as you still have bullets.

685
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,202
You have many yet to shoot.

686
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,966
Once you've shot the last one,
you can tell us the truth.

687
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,968
I think the two of us
have something in common...

688
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,801
the same enemy.

689
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,887
Templer is a dangerous man.

690
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,769
He's violent.

691
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:02,049
He's threatened me more than once.

692
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,127
Why don't you come in?
This is my house.

693
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,604
I don't think the houses in this town
are very welcoming towards guests.

694
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,245
My house is different.

695
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,201
If a stranger is tired
from a long journey, he must rest.

696
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,081
Please, come in.

697
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,326
Why is it so important to you?

698
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,850
Because I'm afraid.

699
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,922
I've been threatened.

700
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,525
You can shoot.

701
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,762
I need protection.

702
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,444
<i>I'll pay YOU-</i>

703
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,840
Come.

704
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,606
Come.

705
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,290
Make yourself at home.

706
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,690
I do everything myself.

707
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,570
I have no servants.
I don't trust them. Servants steal.

708
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,165
If you only knew this town.

709
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,891
Go on, eat.
It'll do you good.

710
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,846
I'll treat you well if you stay.

711
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,041
You may not believe me,
but I've helped everyone here.

712
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,804
And now I'm afraid.

713
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,124
An honest man can't sleep
in peace in this town.

714
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,762
Do you live alone?

715
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,444
Unfortunately, yes.

716
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,568
Well, it's as if I did.

717
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,322
There's always a woman at the window.

718
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,562
- Oh, so you've seen her.
- Yes.

719
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,645
She's my wife,
but it's as if she didn't exist.

720
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,810
She's crazy.

721
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,723
I have to keep her locked in her room.

722
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,770
She wouldn't hurt anyone,
but she's lost her mind.

723
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,604
She's like a child.

724
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,604
I'm especially afraid for her,
if something were to happen to me.

725
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,924
Sorrow's men are raiders.
They'd find my house very tempting.

726
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:31,171
As for Templer, you've seen for yourself
what kind of man he is.

727
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,323
Besides, he lives openly in sin.

728
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,291
Maybe that's why the Lord's hand
punished him by killing his son.

729
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,250
You know, he's not married
to that woman Flow.

730
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,562
They've always caused a scandal
by living together.

731
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,087
Is it good?
Do you like it?

732
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,447
I want out!
I want out!

733
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,730
Do you hear that?

734
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,362
She always does this.

735
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,409
Poor woman.

736
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,683
What a mess.

737
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,889
Okay. Find the stranger and kill him.
He mustn't see another sunset.

738
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,962
Those two Indians are a nuisance.

739
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,441
We have to find an excuse to provoke him.

740
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,809
Do whatever you want, but I want
the stranger dead by tomorrow night, okay?

741
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,645
All right, sir.
I'll take care of it.

742
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,927
Here you go.
It's a good bed.

743
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,763
Don't leave me alone,
and don't fall asleep.

744
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,329
Did you hear that?

745
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,090
Like this.
Don't turn it off.

746
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,403
You can rest and still be alert.

747
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,244
I'm sleepy.

748
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,641
I'm sleepy, and I'm going to sleep.

749
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,883
I want to leave early tomorrow morning.
Good night.

750
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,167
I said good night.

751
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,526
So you're really here.

752
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,683
I heard your voice, steps, noises.

753
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,842
Don't you recognize me?

754
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,810
Yes, I saw you at the window.

755
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,446
I was signaling to you,
but you didn't understand.

756
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,250
What were you trying to tell me?

757
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,687
That you had to leave, get out of here.

758
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,401
This is no place for you.
You're different from the others.

759
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,451
You can't stay in this town.
You, at least, must save yourself.

760
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,366
- Save myself from what, death?
- No, from something much worse.

761
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,966
Living here is terrible.

762
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,124
Look at me.

763
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,402
- What's your name?
- Elizabeth.

764
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,650
- Are you sick?
- That's not true.

765
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:57,722
He wants me to think I'm crazy,
and I've accepted it.

766
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,491
Why? What did you do?

767
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,882
I fell in love with another man
a long time ago.

768
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,043
Ever since then,
he's kept me locked in that room.

769
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,320
- So you're not crazy?
- Yes, I am.

770
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,004
I don't understand.

771
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,482
Yes, because I need to be loved so badly.

772
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,400
And he let you out.

773
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,480
But Why?

774
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,884
So that you will defend his house,
his money, his stuff.

775
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,247
Where is he now?

776
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,761
No, don't.
Go away, while there's still time.

777
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:36,929
Do you really want to kiss me?

778
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,923
My love, my love.

779
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,960
- What's going on?
- Halt!

780
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,805
- It's Sorrow's men.
- Get your guns and go to the windows.

781
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,564
But don't shoot. Go!

782
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,688
Stop the horses.

783
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,843
Templer, open the door!

784
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:47,362
- What are we going to do? The gold!
- They'll find it!

785
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,488
We have to hide it.

786
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:56,051
Open up, Templer, or else!

787
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,408
There are many of us!
We could knock your house down!

788
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,010
Open up!

789
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,728
Come on, boys.
Let's stop wasting time.

790
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,609
Break the door down.

791
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,765
Carlos, Pablo, Vince, Jonathan, get up there!

792
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,922
You, hold the horses.

793
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,605
Go on!

794
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,364
Give it your all!

795
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,802
This is no time for social calls.

796
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,327
The saloon is closed.
We're in mourning.

797
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,763
Listen to him.
He almost sounds sincere.

798
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:12,481
Come on, boys.
Get to work and search the house!

799
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,286
<i>Guapa.</i>

800
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,650
Well, now.

801
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,729
Are you ready to talk?
Where did you hide it?

802
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,247
I let you search everywhere
so you could see for yourselves.

803
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,560
Now you have.

804
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:23,041
There's no gold here,
and you want to know why?

805
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,242
Because the gold is at Hagerman's.

806
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,810
He has it.

807
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,121
If you're lying, you'll be in big trouble.

808
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,324
They're here. They're coming.
You must save me.

809
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,325
They're outside. Look.

810
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,721
No! Don't show yourself at the window.

811
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,968
This is why I invited you here.

812
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,010
Shoot! Defend me!

813
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:51,242
You invited me here to defend
your house, your wife, your life.

814
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,403
Or is there something else
you wanted me to defend?

815
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,403
- Which house is it?
- I don't know.

816
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,121
- There's a light on down there.
- Vince, this is going to be fun.

817
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,282
There's Willie.

818
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,362
This is the house.

819
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,090
Hagerman!

820
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,205
Fork over the gold
if you don't want any trouble.

821
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,884
This is what you're defending.

822
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,803
- Give it to them, my love.
- Wretch!

823
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,804
- I don't want them to hurt you!
- You crazy hag, what are you doing?

824
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,370
Leave her alone!

825
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,724
Hagerman, open up!

826
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,966
We know you have it.

827
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,565
Open up!

828
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,960
- Look. There's someone upstairs.
- Open up, Hagerman. Templer confessed!

829
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,924
Fork over the gold!
We're running out of patience!

830
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,530
That's not him, Willie!

831
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,251
Watch out!
It's the stranger!

832
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,561
- The gold! Willie, it's the gold!
- Shoot!

833
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,850
- Shoot him!
- Here you go! Take the gold, if you can!

834
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,490
Shoot!

835
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,801
You bastard! You traitor!

836
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,407
Shoot!

837
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,604
Traitor!

838
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,449
Gather the horses.

839
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,404
In the saddle. Let's go!

840
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,881
Don't be afraid.

841
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,042
It's all over.

842
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,403
You damned hag!

843
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,721
You're a snake in the grass!

844
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,521
You and that dirty half-breed.
Is this how you defend me?

845
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,491
I'll crush you both.
You'll see what Hagerman's made of!

846
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,607
Try to forget.
Please don't be sad.

847
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,969
What about love?
Doesn't it count for something?

848
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,247
Doesn't it help at all?

849
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,366
Love is impossible...

850
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,848
as long as certain people walk the earth.

851
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,888
Yes, that's true.

852
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,526
I see them from my window.

853
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,128
They're horrible.

854
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,288
My gun!

855
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:48,570
I gave you the power to walk
over serpents and scorpions,

856
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,802
and over any enemy power.

857
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,042
Nothing will harm you.

858
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:57,770
Whoever among you covets greatness
will become a servant.

859
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,448
And whoever among you wishes
to be first will be the servant of all,

860
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,969
because the son of man himself
came not to be served,

861
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:13,685
but to serve and give his life
as ransom for many others.

862
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,121
God, what a day.

863
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,051
Get me something to drink.

864
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,441
That'll teach you
to give my address to your friends.

865
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:55,171
This will take care of both of you.

866
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,891
He took it while we were sleeping.

867
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,482
Why? Where did he go?

868
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,605
I must find him.

869
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:09,729
He's not alone.
There are too many of them.

870
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,768
I'm afraid you won't come back.

871
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,729
- Do you want me to stay?
- No.

872
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,849
You're the only one
who can face them. You must go.

873
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,282
I'll come back for you.

874
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,650
Remember.

875
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:48,129
If you don't take me away
from this prison, it's all over for me.

876
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,201
I'll be lost.

877
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,521
- He's riddled with bullets.
- He sure is.

878
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,810
Strange that he left his gun.

879
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,450
It's empty-

880
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,204
This gun looks familiar.

881
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,328
Wait a minute!

882
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,887
This is a golden bullet.

883
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:14,165
Murderer!

884
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,686
What are we waiting for?
Let's kill him.

885
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,207
Come on!
It's time to end this.

886
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:24,365
- Flory! Where is Flory?
- I haven't seen her all morning.

887
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:26,249
She's always been a hussy.

888
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,891
I bet she's involved somehow.

889
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,008
- Go and get your guns!
- Yes, let's go!

890
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,809
Come on, Larry!

891
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,850
Hey, you! You!

892
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,442
Quick, come here!

893
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,286
My God, something terrible's happened.

894
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,169
I still can't believe it.

895
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,846
Hagerman killed Templer,
and he wanted to kill me too.

896
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,287
I ran away.
I'm so frightened.

897
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:06,966
Only you can help me.

898
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,408
- How did it happen?
- It was at the saloon.

899
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:13,086
We had just come back from the funeral.

900
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:17,201
I'm in big trouble, you know.
They'll blame me for Templer's death.

901
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,489
Who will believe me over Hagerman?

902
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,403
We weren't even married.

903
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,926
He'll kill me or have me killed.

904
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,684
My God.

905
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,690
Do you want to be rich?

906
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,802
What do you mean?

907
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,240
Say what you mean, for once.

908
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,961
I'm serious.
The gold, Templer's gold.

909
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:49,044
If you help me,
we'll split it between us.

910
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:53,600
- Where is it?
- At the cemetery, hidden in Evan's coffin.

911
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,081
I'll never have the courage
to go and get it.

912
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:59,767
But there's enough there
for both of us to live on forever.

913
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,526
If anyone dares to touch Evan's coffin,
you had all better beware.

914
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,602
Isn't what's happened enough for you people?

915
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:09,082
You're rotten, more rotten than any corpse.

916
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,964
That gold belongs to no one.

917
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,202
Don't you see it's my only hope?

918
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,609
How can I leave this place?

919
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,205
You're crazy.

920
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,409
They'll kill me, and they'll kill you too.

921
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,688
Old Colt.

922
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,728
- Are we ready? Let's go.
- Let's move.

923
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,322
Let's get the bastard.

924
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:55,166
- He'll dance on the gallows!
- This'll be fun!

925
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:59,086
We're protecting our families.
Order will return to our town.

926
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,049
Let's crush the bastards.

927
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,168
- That's right, Hagerman.
- Wise words.

928
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,925
- Let's clean this town up
- We'll look everywhere.

929
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,480
- Let's stick together.
- Don't scatter.

930
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,166
- Do you see anyone, Larry?
- We have to circle the whole town.

931
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,164
- Death to the bastards!
- Let's all go look down there!

932
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,766
- Everybody together!
- To death with them!

933
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,160
- Gregory!
- What is it?

934
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,522
It's intolerable seeing dirty Indians
in a town like ours.

935
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,206
- There they are, the two redskins.
- Let's start with them!

936
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,648
We have to cleanse the town
of dogs, Indians and strangers.

937
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:46,441
- Let's send them to the Great Spirit.
- Yeah, let 'em have it!

938
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,046
- Let's do it.
- Get him!

939
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,600
- Down.
- On your knees, you dog!

940
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:03,602
Don't shoot.
It would be a shame.

941
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,082
I've always wanted a scalp.

942
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,527
- Done.
- A perfect success.

943
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:45,601
Well done.

944
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:48,684
- Aren't I a good hairdresser?
- You're a real pro.

945
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,842
I heard him go “plop.”

946
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:01,085
Hurry! They're looking for you.
They want to kill you.

947
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,845
- Where's your friend?
- They killed him.

948
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,610
Killer!

949
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,247
- Run!
- This Way!

950
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:40,451
Stop! You can't get away!

951
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,922
Go on, Willie, give it to him!

952
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,129
Get back. This man is ours!

953
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,091
Nice hit!

954
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,243
Traitor!
Now you'll deal with Sorrow.

955
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:17,171
Where is he?
What did you do to him?

956
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,009
You care about him, don't you?

957
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:24,689
He's in the hands of a man
who might hate him more than I do.

958
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,649
Come here.

959
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,245
Come on!

960
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:38,122
The only way you're getting out
of here is if you die, you whore!

961
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,129
Stop, Carlos.
That's enough.

962
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,884
So, you won't talk?
You're being stupid.

963
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:02,281
I offered you a job with the boys.

964
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,169
I liked you.

965
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,208
We could have been friends,

966
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,489
but you chose to double-cross me.

967
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,291
I want to know where the gold is,
and you're going to tell me.

968
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:17,322
Not so much for the gold,
but because you've disappointed me, deeply.

969
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,321
Sure.

970
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:23,769
You could have been one of us,
but you defended that shopkeeper's house.

971
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,002
You sided with that ﬂoozy.

972
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,970
But now I'll make you tell me everything.

973
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:34,285
Carlos, why don't you let loose
our little pets, our secret persuaders?

974
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:40,010
We have to leave now,
but you won't be alone.

975
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,845
You can choose your companions yourself.

976
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,445
Which do you prefer?

977
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:49,287
Desert snakes, vampire bats
or the black lizard of darkness?

978
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,488
I leave the choice up to you.

979
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,484
You'll have plenty of time.

980
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,128
Are you done, Carlos?

981
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:58,884
Let's go.

982
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,131
Forget about the theatrics.

983
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,928
It's no use, Sorrow.

984
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,569
You'll never have me.

985
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,450
You'll talk.

986
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:20,161
I've broken men much stronger than you.

987
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,561
Enjoy your solitude.

988
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:26,647
Let's go, Carlos, and leave him to it.

989
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,202
Willie, Jonathan, Carlos!

990
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,806
Are you ready?
You can go!

991
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,770
Our prisoner talked, finally!

992
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:10,569
You can go.

993
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,728
The gold is hidden in the cemetery.

994
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:16,727
Find it! Search everywhere
and come back soon.

995
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,325
Go On, go!

996
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:48,801
The cemetery.

997
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,088
Are you talking to yourself, friend?

998
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,208
Are you lonely?

999
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,722
Do you want some company?

1000
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,450
The cemetery.

1001
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,847
They should be back before daylight.

1002
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,848
Don't you want a drink?

1003
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:03,130
- How did you get in?
- I played an old song on my ﬂute.

1004
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,242
That's a good corporal.

1005
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:14,129
Give me a drink.
Give me a drink.

1006
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,363
You old drunkard.
I'm coming.

1007
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:39,326
You don't understand. It takes a uniform
to make a young man look good.

1008
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:45,043
Handsome and depraved,
with death always close at hand.

1009
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:51,723
Drink, you old sponge.

1010
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,125
You have more vices than I do.

1011
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,248
More!

1012
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,130
Damn it!

1013
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:06,647
There's nothing in here!
We've been had!

1014
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,724
The gold has to be here.
The stranger talked!

1015
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:12,371
It's here!
We have to find it!

1016
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,443
Come on! Get your shovels!

1017
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:19,091
Dig! Find it!

1018
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,645
Dig!

1019
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,848
We have to find it!

1020
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:32,130
Come on! Faster!

1021
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,806
Put your backs into it!

1022
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,045
Wait.

1023
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,451
Quick!

1024
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,522
Take as much as you can.

1025
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,289
Hurry UP!

1026
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,210
Here.

1027
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,682
Quick, they're coming.

1028
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,644
Now! Go!

1029
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:54,724
- The master's horse.
- Catch him!

1030
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,041
He must have broken his lead.

1031
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,327
- He's acting crazy!
- Try to stop him!

1032
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,846
- Don't let him out. Stop him!
- The other way, Santos!

1033
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,127
Grab his bridle!

1034
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:07,449
- Something's wrong.
- I got him!

1035
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,522
Watch out! Dynamite!

1036
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:27,489
Your time...

1037
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,041
Time... Your time...

1038
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,730
Your time has come.

1039
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,329
<i>Cabron!</i>

1040
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,366
Your time... Your time...

1041
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,086
What did you do, you miserable wretch?

1042
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:49,087
- Look at that fire.
- It's the entire upstairs.

1043
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:51,925
- Downstairs too. Look!
- The stairs are on fire!

1044
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,729
How did it happen?

1045
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,644
Look at the ﬂames.
Do something!

1046
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,768
Everything's on fire, even the ground ﬂoor.

1047
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,842
Who can get close to that?
Feel the heat!

1048
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,850
- The store!
- Hurry, go.

1049
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:12,042
Let's thank the Lord
that the church didn't catch fire!

1050
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:15,966
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Too bad. It was a nice house.

1051
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,566
- But where's Hagerman?
- I don't know.

1052
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:21,530
With all the people who owe him money,
you know how it is.

1053
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:24,968
If he were caught in there,
it would be good for a lot of people.

1054
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,964
- Did you hear a scream?
- I thought I heard one too.

1055
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,725
We can't get closer.
Feel the heat.

1056
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,883
- Good thing the house is detached.
- The whole town could have gone up in ﬂames!

1057
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:00,167
Let's stand back.
It's dangerous to stand here.

1058
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:04,131
- It could collapse at any moment.
- It's over.

1059
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,800
Look at me!
Look at me!
