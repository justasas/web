1
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,376
Piringo.

2
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:47,007
Been looking for you.

3
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:52,386
It's the end of the road for you.

4
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,262
What's that sound?

5
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:11,867
That's the sound of
the Gion Shoja temple bells.

6
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,911
What?

7
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,074
You know, them
Heike and Genji boys.

8
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,481
On a distant island,

9
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:24,989
these two clans split into
the Reds and the Whites.

10
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,581
Wage war.

11
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,686
Sort of like that
War of the Roses, you know?

12
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,924
In England?

13
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,127
Who won'?

14
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,033
The Whites?

15
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,031
This high noon battle
was waged in Dannoura.

16
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:50,047
Hear the Heike clan in red
got themselves hog-tied

17
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,947
by the Genji clan in white.

18
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:58,581
Their story goes
a little something like this.

19
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,319
The sound

20
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:05,022
of the Gion Shoja temple bells

21
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,293
echoes the impermanence

22
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,095
of all things.

23
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,137
What bells you say'?

24
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,640
The color
of the sala flower

25
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,609
reveals the truth

26
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,306
that to flourish

27
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,279
is to fall.

28
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,759
The proud do not endure

29
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,990
like a passing dream

30
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,330
on a night in spring.

31
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,215
The mighty

32
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,056
fall at last.

33
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,264
See you in hell.

34
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:26,441
To be no more than
dust before the wind.

35
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,622
Piringo.

36
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,489
That's Why I love you.

37
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,985
Ain't nothing back there.

38
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,897
You ain't heard me'?

39
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,933
It's an ain't nothing town.

40
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,199
Bet you came
for the gold, too.

41
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,071
White or Red'?

42
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,769
You Genji

43
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,337
<i>or Hake'?</i>

44
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,441
Which gang's gonna buy it'?

45
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,579
My reward is one third.

46
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:35,820
If there ain't no treasure, don't pay.

47
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,231
Benkei, show him.

48
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:45,292
No doubt about who's
gonna be left standing.

49
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:50,535
But best not get any ideas
about playing Yojimbo.

50
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:55,978
You got to be alive to
spend your money, stranger.

51
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:16,129
The kid's got a heart,
and balls to match.

52
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,537
No! Join us!

53
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,938
We'll do better than a third!

54
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,839
We'll leave you half!

55
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,104
Half'?

56
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,777
We'll give you everything.

57
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:36,411
But with us, it's a lifetime contract.

58
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,614
Don't know about that.

59
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,821
I don't stay long in one place.

60
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,990
Suits us fine!

61
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,969
We'll give you half
for this one-time deal.

62
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,852
Not too shabby.

63
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,628
Hey, boy!

64
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:23,292
Hey. If you're
such a quick draw,

65
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,563
you don't need them.

66
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,196
Take it all.

67
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,334
And tell them to shove
their lifetime contract.

68
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:39,011
Boy, don't rush yourself.

69
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:44,282
Make your choice
after cooling your heels.

70
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,324
This town can't grow from seed,

71
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,795
but I can offer
some soba tea at my place.

72
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,195
Come with me.

73
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,698
Hey-

74
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,148
So the Reds
rode in first, eh'?

75
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,448
Yeah. How do you figure that'?

76
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,120
Simple.

77
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,023
With the sheriff,

78
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,620
seeing the law hitched
with the weaker side

79
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:31,066
must mean they made him
an offer he couldn't refuse.

80
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,933
Uh, of course, now,

81
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:39,466
maybe he's looking
for a chance to switch sides.

82
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,840
<i>How long has it been like this'?</i>

83
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,280
<i>Two months since
the Heikes Walked in.</i>

84
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,686
<i>And before that,</i>

85
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,692
<i>gold prospectors
started coming 'round.</i>

86
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,904
What?

87
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,464
<i>But what we couldn't
figure out was</i>

88
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,307
<i>why so many people,
and why now?</i>

89
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,040
The end of last month,

90
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,310
a town with the same legend

91
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,714
found the mother lode.

92
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:26,587
The country's gone crazy
with Heike gold tales.

93
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,591
Every nook and cranny
of every tovvn

94
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,921
with the treasure legend

95
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,292
is swarming with prospectors.

96
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:38,825
It's a genuine gold rush!
Yee-ha ha ha!

97
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,137
You can't touch this land,
or you'll be cursed.

98
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,201
Ha!

99
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,908
We'll take that curse
off your hands.

100
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,817
And we can't quietly sit by
as you lay waste to our land!

101
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,833
<i>In the beginning,</i>

102
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,567
we expected them
<i>to</i> be a godsend

103
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,769
<i>because they were Heike,
like us.</i>

104
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,981
<i>But things soon went sour.</i>

105
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,547
<i>The Heikes
ran off the prospectors</i>

106
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,680
<i>and started digging.</i>

107
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,359
Look!

108
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,394
What?

109
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,930
Kiyomori! Boss Kiyomori!

110
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,966
We found this.

111
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:48,165
<i>Instead of that wood marker
that read “Fear the curse“.</i>

112
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,605
I knew it!

113
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:56,306
<i>So they figured the treasure
must be somewhere,</i>

114
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,974
<i>and they have
been here since.</i>

115
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,768
<i>Boss Kiyomori.</i>

116
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:36,209
From today, you're one of us.

117
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:41,349
Think of it as being on vacation.

118
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,292
Uh, yes.

119
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,229
I've been meaning
to take some time off.

120
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,766
Feeling a little beside myself.

121
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,432
<i>But his reign of power
didn't last long.</i>

122
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,780
Dang.

123
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,252
You boys are a day late
and a dollar short.

124
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,312
This is our town.

125
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,023
Huh?

126
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,086
Ooh..

127
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,327
Dang.

128
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,326
<i>Germs.</i>

129
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:02,330
Shigemori, we got to
fatten you up, boy.

130
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,169
<i>Boss Yoshitsune.</i>

131
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,887
<i>The Genjis didn't make
a move against the Heikes.</i>

132
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,689
<i>They left the gold digging to them,</i>

133
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,927
<i>sat back, and waited
for their chance to steal the loot.</i>

134
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,238
Hey-

135
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,113
Finders keepers.

136
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,277
<i>After that,
people began to leave.</i>

137
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,981
<i>Just a few families are left.</i>

138
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,992
Ah, we might as well hire you.

139
00:16:56,048 --> 00:17:00,463
But all the town can offer is this.

140
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,965
Dadacha-mame.

141
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,295
Try this.

142
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,668
Hey. Hey, welcome back.

143
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:15,545
This is my grandson.
Heihachi.

144
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,362
Give it a go.

145
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,742
Death isn't to be feared.

146
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,415
Don't Watch the blade.

147
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,620
How many times
do I have to tell you'?

148
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,027
Don't follow the blade
with your eyes.

149
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,727
Don't see it, feel it.

150
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,532
That's the essence
of Mononofu training.

151
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:20,673
Mononofu training
ain't samurai bullshit.

152
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:24,475
Being a samurai is
a philosophical Way of life.

153
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:29,918
But the life of Mononofu
means life of fighting!

154
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,318
If you ask me,

155
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,657
samurai are still
Wearing their skivvies.

156
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,822
They are vain.

157
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,197
They're still concerned
about their looks.

158
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,863
That's "tits on the bull" thinking.

159
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,573
But if you peel away that last layer

160
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:59,104
so you are naked,

161
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,175
this in the raw fighting the spirit is

162
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,984
Warrior's lot in life.

163
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,355
His realm,

164
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,621
our realm

165
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,926
is deeper than the samuraPs.

166
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,212
Now..

167
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,217
you gonna come at me

168
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,915
or whistle Dixie?

169
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,598
What's it gonna be'?

170
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:07,303
Take this handsome man
to the Reds

171
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:11,439
or hand him over to the Whites?

172
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,973
You know, I'm at sea.

173
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,748
I don't know.

174
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,550
Depends on him.

175
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,366
Today's special is the Whites

176
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,370
with a side of
mashed potatoes and soup.

177
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,997
Forget about the Heike gang.

178
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:41,408
Their Boss Kiyomori smells
like a dead dog on a hot day.

179
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,675
He's lost so much,
he's getting dumber.

180
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:56,449
"The sound of
the Gion Shoja temple bells

181
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:03,262
echoes the impermanence
of all things."

182
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,799
You follow'?

183
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:09,134
Yes, I.. uh..

184
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:13,472
It means everything in this
old world changes.

185
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:18,504
It means we can never
call our services off.

186
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,245
We'll finally restore the glory

187
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,845
of our family name
and the riding-high.

188
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,586
Genji gang will be lead to ruins.

189
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:37,765
"The color of the sala flowers

190
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,770
"reveals the truth

191
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:44,569
that to flourish is to fall."

192
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,269
That's it.

193
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,609
It's a law of nature.

194
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,512
The Genjis are going down!

195
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,922
From today,

196
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,825
I read this.

197
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,056
What's that?

198
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,397
Shakespeare. Henry VI.

199
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,493
The War of the Roses.

200
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,438
War of the Roses?

201
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,134
Come on, boy.

202
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,734
Don't you know your Shakespeare'?

203
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,271
It's a story about
the Reds winning the war.

204
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,046
The Reds win'?

205
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,383
Yes, we'll win.

206
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:38,920
Yeah! Kiyomori!

207
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,926
What?

208
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,025
Kiyomori.

209
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,143
Don't ever call me
Kiyomori again!

210
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,647
From today..

211
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,954
the name's.. Henry.

212
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:23,133
Side with the Genjis.

213
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:28,201
They got a young lady,
fine as cream gravy.

214
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,372
That painted lady
used to be a dancer.

215
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,420
She's the kid's mama,
but still mighty fine.

216
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,922
Hasn't aged a bit.

217
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:44,222
A Woman of true
Genji lineage.

218
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,354
<i>Hés Germ and Hake'?</i>

219
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,424
Huh'? Oh, the kid'?

220
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,132
Yeah, he's a half-breed.

221
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,367
And his father?

222
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,467
Got himself killed.

223
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:18,189
You're of
the same stock, boy'?

224
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,599
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

225
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:44,577
He can't talk no more.

226
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:48,819
Hard to after seeing
your dad murdered.

227
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,160
What's his mother doing
on the Genji side'?

228
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,626
Ahem.

229
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:04,235
To begin with, that granny's boy
went to vvork in the city.

230
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,867
<i>Then, one day,</i>

231
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:11,176
<i>that boy, her son Akira,</i>

232
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,513
<i>[brought the Gen]! Woman home.</i>

233
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:23,384
Mama, the days of being
Genji or Heike are done with.

234
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,526
<i>I don't know how
or where the two met,</i>

235
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,370
<i>but his mother
blessed their marriage.</i>

236
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,900
<i>So Red and White got hitched,</i>

237
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,447
<i>and they figured
crossing roses,</i>

238
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:48,245
<i>blooming in both colors,
was romantic.</i>

239
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,162
<i>And they raised Heihachi,</i>

240
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,757
<i>their Red and White treasure.</i>

241
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:11,600
<i>But then the fighting
started again.</i>

242
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,241
Finders keepers.

243
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,345
Ugh!

244
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,315
Kiyomori!

245
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:37,423
Get out.
There ain't no gold here.

246
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,594
That's it'?

247
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,035
Take it all!

248
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,441
If you want it, take it.

249
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,104
And get out!

250
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,718
Daddy!

251
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,480
Heihachi!

252
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,185
Daddy!

253
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,243
Love hurts.

254
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,327
My favorite color.

255
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,033
Looks good on you.

256
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,703
<i>[Folks say</i> a <i>Gen]! Woman
painted red</i>

257
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,074
<i>Ht a ﬂame in him.</i>

258
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,248
No! No!

259
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,515
Aah!

260
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,080
I'll teach you good!

261
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,726
I show you what a real man is!

262
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,932
I know, I know.

263
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:38,216
So <i>she rah to the hideout
of her own ﬂesh and blood.</i>

264
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,689
<i>Was it to protect her son,</i>

265
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,159
<i>or get vengeance
for her husband?</i>

266
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,963
How much for the lady'?

267
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,395
How much you got'?

268
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:25,007
Depends on how much
you'll pay me.

269
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:52,118
Keep it in your pants, lily liver.

270
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:56,256
The tougher man gets the girl.

271
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,006
Do what you like.

272
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,048
Do her here, upstairs.

273
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:17,246
Wherever and however
you please.

274
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,587
You are the second
cunning wolf

275
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,690
I ever really wanted
to draw iron at.

276
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,258
Who was the first?

277
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,065
A legend.

278
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:41,037
One I heard
when I was a kid.

279
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,371
Oh, yeah?

280
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,820
The Bloody..

281
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:00,090
Benten.

282
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:06,067
Bloody Benten.

283
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:13,507
The fighting goddess legend.

284
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,044
Shit.

285
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,010
Now I really want
to draw iron at you.

286
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,512
Nice.

287
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,580
Ain't refined,

288
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:05,219
but it hits you deep down.

289
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:11,291
The Anasazi play that music.

290
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:16,566
They were here
before any of us.

291
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:21,576
They still keep the old Ways.

292
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,525
<i>N'</i>

293
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,177
You'll do fine.

294
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:12,187
I want Kiyomori dead.

295
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:21,462
You've thrown away your body,
everything, all for revenge?

296
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,228
So what?

297
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,202
Don't pity me.

298
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,240
I don't need useless
compassion from you.

299
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:36,108
Good. It ain't
good for nothing, huh'?

300
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,715
Do you want me'?

301
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,523
Very much.

302
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,922
But be careful.

303
00:40:54,985 --> 00:41:01,266
Yoshitsunes men left town
to get a powerful weapon.

304
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,965
Yoichi wants you dead.

305
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,838
They'll likely be here by sunup.

306
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,405
When the shooting starts,

307
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:18,318
take Heihachi and
escape to the mountains.

308
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,845
You're not gonna run'?

309
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:28,420
Oh, you got something
against them, too'?

310
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,932
I got my reasons.

311
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:22,539
Have the roses
bloomed yet'?

312
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:26,520
What are they named'?

313
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,726
Love.

314
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,469
Howdy, Sheriff.

315
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:58,108
"A special Weapon
will be here soon.

316
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,086
<i>“Before the Germs get "w,</i>

319
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,862
Sorry.

320
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,767
What are you doing, boy'?

321
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,831
Shit or get off the pot!

322
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,513
Hold your horses.

323
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:36,422
Instead of telling them
the godawful truth,

324
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,620
don't you reckon
we better hightail it'?

325
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,898
I ain't listening to you no more.

326
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,969
Kiyomori!

327
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,840
Boss Kiyomori!

328
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,946
Aah!

329
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,643
The name's Henry.

330
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,152
Where have you been'?

331
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,783
I was spying on the Genjis,

332
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:15,422
and things are getting
Way out of hand.

333
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,796
Excuse me.

334
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,995
Come again?

335
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,722
Whoa!

336
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:50,630
See-ya! See-ya! See-ya! See-ya!

337
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,792
See-ya! See-ya!

338
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:56,565
I told you we shouldve
skipped town.

339
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,437
I told you.

340
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,010
Shit. Whoa!

341
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,217
Go!

342
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,527
Ye-yeah!

343
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,296
Fear nothing!

344
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,632
Hah!

345
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:11,002
Whoa!

346
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,453
Stupid.

347
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,047
You did this.

348
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,795
Fire, boys, and guard the Windows.

349
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,792
How'd he pull that off'?

350
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,386
Come!

351
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,533
Ichiro. Matsui.

352
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,098
Follow me.

353
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,734
What happened'?

354
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,176
Tell you later!

355
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,736
We're going to the old man's
place in the mountains.

356
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,339
Heihachi! Heihachi!
Come on, hurry!

357
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,112
- Come on!
- This way.

358
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:28,274
Watch your step.

359
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,846
Take Heihachi
and go without me.

360
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,176
What did you forget'?

361
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,273
Something important!

362
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,784
What's Wrong?

363
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:05,140
Forget them!
You don't need them!

364
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,844
No! They're..

365
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,826
They're..

366
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,395
They're my~

367
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,441
heart.

368
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:07,072
No matter what,
one of you's gonna die.

369
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,773
Heihachi. Please.

370
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,785
Please, not him.

371
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:21,186
If you want him to live,

372
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:27,126
drop.. your.. guns.

373
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,841
Stop bitching! Hyah!

374
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,759
The time is now!

375
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,460
Ho!

376
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:35,290
Hey. Hey!

377
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:48,070
Die!

378
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,614
Hmm.

379
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,547
<i>EATunQ</i>

380
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,281
Haah!

381
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,626
Aah!

382
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,468
Lucky me.

383
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,382
Henry!

384
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,019
Aah!

385
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:26,866
Hah! Ho!

386
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,160
Henry!

387
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:30,386
Shigemori,

388
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:34,765
I won't die until we win.

389
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,605
Uhh.. Uh..

390
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,307
Payback's a bitch!

391
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:59,119
Before you die..

392
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:06,366
I have something sweet.

393
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,662
You want some, bitch'?

394
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:52,410
You are an animal.

395
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,929
Toshio!
Throw it here!

396
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:49,496
Can't be..

397
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,039
bloody..

398
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,289
Heihachi.

399
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:20,061
Heihachi.

400
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:23,593
What are you doing'?

401
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,075
Open your eyes.

402
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,771
Hmm'?

403
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,575
See for yourself.

404
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:39,116
You can't close them
to reality.

405
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:43,519
Open your eyes!

406
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,720
Heihachi! Heihachi!

407
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:50,458
Open your eyes!

408
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,311
Aah!

409
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,308
Could you
visit this address

410
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:39,438
and stock up on these?

411
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:43,450
If he is still alive,

412
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:48,478
my signature here
should help you out.

413
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,318
I wish I could go,

414
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,726
but I can't
leave the boy alone.

415
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:55,728
Ruriko.

416
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,526
Hmm'?

417
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:02,263
But these are guns.

418
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,465
Tell him I need help,

419
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:09,101
and he owes me.

420
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,874
You are the only one
I can depend on.

421
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,747
What's "BB"?

422
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:54,255
When this doubly
talented goddess

423
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,223
used to play music.

424
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,625
She would hold
her instruments
in both hands.

425
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:04,722
But when she was
on the Warpath,

426
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:08,564
she held Weapons
in eight hands.

427
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,741
When the fire of vengeance dvvelled in her
eyes,

428
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:24,512
this murdering goddess
was Wide awake,

429
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:28,818
and everything in her Way
got stained blood red.

430
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:39,295
They dubbed her
Bloody Benten.

431
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:49,102
Nicknamed double B for short.

432
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,803
I was the one who
educated her in killing,

433
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:55,281
and it was tough going.

434
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,347
You like it'?

435
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:05,690
It's too sweet.

436
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:08,456
Well..
Too much sugar.

437
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,431
This is sukiyaki,
not a damn lollipop!

438
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,593
Oh, I'm so sorry.

439
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:19,163
How many times
do I gotta tell you

440
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:23,040
before it sinks into
that thick skull of yours

441
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:27,514
that you draw
the sweetness out of
the Chinese cabbage?

442
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,551
Sorry..
And this tofu.

443
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,847
It's kinugoshi!

444
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:37,380
But-But..
But the store was sold out.

445
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,754
Aah!

446
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:45,355
No.. damn.. darned excuses!

447
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,365
I'm sorry.

448
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,299
Dang useless woman.

449
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:52,362
Why I ever thought
I could make
a gunfighter out of..

450
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,951
Listen up, girl.

451
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,582
If this were a gunfight,

452
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,594
you wouldn't be saying
"They sold out of bullets,

453
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,597
let's shoot beans instead,"
now could ya'?

454
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:21,863
That'd mean death
to me and you, wouldn't it'?
Hmm, wouldn't it'?

455
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:26,199
That's my girl.
There you go.

456
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,900
Never let
your guard down.

457
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,375
Yes.

458
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,810
The Grim Reaper himself
dwells in that pot.

459
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,041
Don't you forget that.

460
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:40,784
I.. I nev..

461
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,687
Sugar.

462
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,763
Don't worry.

463
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:53,494
The sugar helps me.

464
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,632
Lordy lord.

465
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,172
You ain't pregnant,
is ya'?

466
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:08,510
I reckon it will be
a bouncing boy.

467
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,557
Oh, heck.

468
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:21,522
You mean Akira'?

469
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,063
Akira.

470
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,328
How the lovely sound

471
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:30,565
of that name
brings me back.

472
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,606
What can I say'?

473
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:37,668
At the end, I am
an anime otaku at heart.

474
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:39,610
What?

475
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,680
How's my boy'?

476
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:02,903
Ah, so.

477
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:12,276
That's Why you've come
for them irons, eh'?

478
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:20,781
You'll tell her this for me.

479
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,880
Life is all about goodbyes.

480
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:03,123
We are in your hands!

481
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,839
I'm surprised.

482
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,039
He is still alive.

483
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,649
I guess

484
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:02,382
every man's got his own reasons

485
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:06,825
for Why he has to keep on living.

486
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:21,955
Got a cold?

487
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:25,089
Don't you have one, too'?

488
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:54,723
Thank you.

489
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:00,532
You going'?

490
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,262
Huh?

491
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,964
Yep.

492
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:08,201
Going. Where to'?

493
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,604
To settle a score.

494
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:15,649
What score'?

495
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:18,378
The town's got nothing
to do with you.

496
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,010
Shit just happens.

497
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:23,284
That's all.

498
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:29,857
So the meaning of life
is shit happens, huh'?

499
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:34,128
Well, I don't want to run
from the shit anymore.

500
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:36,999
Sorry, but could you
fetch the treasure for me'?

501
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,200
There is one'?

502
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,975
Ruriko,
what about the town law'?

503
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:53,077
As anyone who's getting on
in years around here knows..

504
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:58,191
he was chosen to guard it.

505
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:01,660
That's the town law.

506
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:05,460
I thought Heihachi
would be the next chosen one,

507
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,058
but he's too weak.

508
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:13,471
I reckon he was born at the wrong time
and in the wrong place.

509
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:17,204
He does have a gift
for music, though.

510
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:22,181
But tenderness alone
Won't get you far in life.

511
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:25,275
What are you fixing to do
with the treasure?

512
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:29,289
Settle this
once and for all.

513
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,325
If we lose,
they can have it.

514
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:36,056
If we win,
you can have half.

515
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:39,656
How about it'? You game'?

516
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:43,397
Suits me fine.

517
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:45,029
Okay, then.

518
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:55,045
This way.

519
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,489
No. This way.

520
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,893
I ain't gonna listen to you no more!

521
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:19,100
That's my line!

522
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:21,971
I'll kill you!

523
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:29,981
Aah!

524
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:37,485
Smells like victory.

525
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:41,551
Got the Mr. Gatling riding shotgun.

526
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:46,157
And now, a shield.

527
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,997
A shield'?

528
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:54,097
If you were fatter, it would be perfect.

529
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,109
Hey! Hey!

530
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,376
Hey, hold on!

531
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:06,113
Come on, now! Hey! No! No!

532
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,922
Shit.

533
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:18,362
Hey, if I get taken down,

534
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,991
will you give this
to Heihachi for me'?

535
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:25,004
I'll think about it
if and when you die.

536
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,131
Hey! Hey!

537
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,544
I'll carry the treasure for you.

538
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,772
I'll carry the guns.

539
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,974
And if there's
any more carrying to do,

540
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,449
then let me do it.

541
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:43,457
Well, if you ain't the most stubborn
man I ever did meet.

542
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,956
Let him take it.

543
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:50,986
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

544
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:03,205
Go, Banjo. Go!

545
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,475
We get shot,

546
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,746
and you are the one's
gonna get smoked,

547
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,084
not me.

548
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,589
You die first.

549
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:20,456
No, you die first!

550
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,754
We die.

551
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,662
Okay, we die.

552
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:28,201
We die. I die.

553
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:31,704
You die, he dies, she dies, we die.

554
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,865
Everybody dies.

555
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:06,931
Here's the treasure!

556
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,639
Have at it, boys!

557
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,477
Winner takes all!

558
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,610
Hey! Look!

559
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:24,157
Gold! Gold!

560
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:59,350
Spread out!

561
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:00,859
- Here!
- This way!

562
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:31,213
This way.

563
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:20,202
<i>Where those Hake boys'?</i>

564
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,959
No! No!

565
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,597
No!

566
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:51,160
Get down!

567
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,351
You've got a new toy.

568
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,155
Shields!

569
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:20,959
Aah!

570
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,917
Yoshitsune!

571
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,054
Confess thy error!

572
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:38,511
This time, we win.

573
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:34,460
This time, we win!

574
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:36,365
Ha ha ha ha!

575
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,639
This time..

576
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,607
That's for the mayor.

577
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:27,344
I can.

578
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:35,187
I win.

579
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,355
I win.

580
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:58,281
I ain't dead..

581
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,412
till I beat you.

582
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,725
This is for Akira.

583
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,979
It's all mine!

584
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,089
It's mine.

585
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,641
It's all ours!

586
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:48,893
I§§

587
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:51,958
always..

588
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:54,599
you're..

589
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,567
Don't say it.

590
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:08,875
No one in the world
ever saved Benten's life.

591
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:14,545
Except for you.

592
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,854
Nope.

593
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:24,522
You..

594
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:30,092
You're Ruriko.

595
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:32,832
My..

596
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:37,570
Ruriko.

597
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,613
I'm not..

598
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,550
dead..

599
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,551
Vet.

600
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:06,156
Now this..

601
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:12,421
Is what I call class.

602
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:28,510
So that old granny
was Bloody Benten, eh'?

603
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,983
I'm glad I came here.

604
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:38,013
Hell, I'm glad I was born.

605
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:42,027
Finally, with a worthy opponent,

606
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:46,054
I can risk my life to the death.

607
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,659
Victory..

608
01:29:24,492 --> 01:29:25,971
or death!

609
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:48,710
That's plenty for me.

610
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,909
You keep the rest.

611
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:57,446
Just do me one thing.

612
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,924
Tend to the roses for me.

613
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:09,429
But when it doesn't feel right,

614
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:13,404
you can stop.

615
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:15,839
Now you've got money,

616
01:32:15,897 --> 01:32:19,936
you've got a gun,

617
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:23,141
and the roses, too.

618
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:28,851
Heihachi,

619
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,321
son,

620
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:36,760
no matter what the times may be,

621
01:32:36,817 --> 01:32:39,525
no matter Where you are,

622
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:45,367
what matters is you
and how you deal with this world.

623
01:32:47,795 --> 01:32:53,507
And there ain't no running from it.

624
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:05,855
Don't run.

625
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:10,294
Decide for yourself

626
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:12,228
what tomorrow's gonna be.

627
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:31,937
Love.

628
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:43,713
Your mother was a mighty fine lady.

629
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:34,300
