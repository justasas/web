00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,329
Whoa.

8
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,971
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

9
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:25,934
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

10
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,686
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

11
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,189
I mean you no harm.

12
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:36,194
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

13
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,197
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

14
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,699
I'm looKing for a pair of slave traders

15
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,534
that go by the name
of the Speck brothers.

16
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,536
Might that be you?

17
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,666
- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.

18
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,709
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

19

[Snorting]

20
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:56,464
- What kinda doctor?
- [Schultz] Dentist.

21
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,424
Now, are you the Speck brothers?

22
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,386
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

23
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,138
- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.

24
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,642
- Speak English.
- [Chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,019
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

26
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,481
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

27
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,067
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

28
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,694
Hello, you poor devils!

29
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,614
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

30
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,076
of the Carrucan plantation?

31
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,037
[Man] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

32
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,040
Who said that?

33
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,841
[Schultz lighting match]

34
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,630
What's your name?

35
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,678
Django.

36
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,598
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looKing for.

37
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,685
Do you know who
the Brittle brothers are?

38
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,315
Who are they?

39
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,360
Big John.

40
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,488
Ellis.

41
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:48,826
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

42
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,413
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

43
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,664
Not anymore.

44
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,794
Tell me...

45
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,172
...if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

46
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,008
- would you recognize them?
- [Man] Hey.

47
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,636
- Stop talkin' to him like that.
- Like what?

48
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,346
Like that.

49
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,807
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

50
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,017
Speak English, goddamn it.

51
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,936
Everybody calm down.

52
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:18,815
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

53
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,984
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

54
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,154
[Scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

55
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,448
Move it.

56
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:32,537
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

57
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,499
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

58
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,460
Last chance, fancy pants.

59
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,214
Oh, very well.

[Screaming continues]

64
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,412
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

65
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,497
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

66
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,958
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

67
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,545
You goddamn son of a bitch!

68
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,506
- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...

69
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,383
And you killed ace!

70
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,219
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

71
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,222
And I do believe I have...
One, two, three, four...

72
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,350
...five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

73
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,395
- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.

74
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,106
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

75
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,610
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

76
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,778
[Screaming resumes]

77
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,075
- [Man] God-fuckin'-damn it!
- As I was saying...

78
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,954
...if you were to see the Brittle
brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

79
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,332
Yeah.

80
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,791
Sold American!

81
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,921
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

82
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,845
That iron is nasty business.

83
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,186
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

84
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:21,854
Thank you. Django?

85
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:23,898
Get up on that horse.

86
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:25,858
Also, if I were you,

87
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:37,862
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

88
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

89
00:09:58,391 --> 00:09:58,558

00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,148
Goddamn it! Oh!
[Moaning]

91
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:10,486
One hundred... ten... 20...

92

...and five...

93
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:14,907
...for young Django here.

94
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:17,243
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

95
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:20,454
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

96
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:25,585
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

97
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,336
Do you have one?

98
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:30,423
- You go to hell, dentist.
- [Scoffs]

99
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:32,592
I thought not.

100
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:40,433
No worries. I come prepared.

101
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:42,185
Thank you.

102
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:50,693
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

103
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:58,117
[Nickering]

104
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:03,289
Whoa.

105
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:06,918
Now, as to you poor devils.

106
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:12,131
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

107
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:15,134
you gentlemen have two choices.

108
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:20,431
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

109
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:22,516
then carry him to the nearest town.

110
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:26,270
Which would be at least
37 Miles back the way you came.

111
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:32,109
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

112
00:11:34,654 --> 00:11:34,820
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

113
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,450
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

114
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:40,785
Choice is yours.

115
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:45,331
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

116
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,794
the north star is that one.

117
00:11:52,964 --> 00:12:00,964
Ta-ta. [ClucKing]

118
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:12,108
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

119
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:15,486
- [Lantern crashing]
- [Chains rattling]

120
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,366
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

121
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:23,536
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

122
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:27,290
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

123
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:30,418
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the Doc in El Paso,

124
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:32,628
- I'll get you your freedom.
- [Gun cocKing]

125
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:44,382
- No. No, please...
- [Gunshot echoing]

126
00:12:53,941 --> 00:13:01,941
[Dogs barKing nearby]

127
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:21,719
[SqueaKing]

128
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:23,262
All right, now.

129
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:25,431
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

130
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,769
- [Coughing]
- ...And then in the morning...

131
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:39,562
That's a nigger on a horse.

132
00:13:58,964 --> 00:13:59,131
What's everybody staring at?

133
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:02,843
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

134
00:14:05,096 --> 00:14:13,096
[Goats bleating]

135
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:22,939
Whoa.

136
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,327
Good morning, innkeeper!

137
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:30,955
Two beers for two weary travelers.

138
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:32,873
It's still a bit early.

139
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:35,459
We won't be open for another hour.

140
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:37,461
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

141
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,050
[Gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

142
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:48,681
Get that nigger outta here!

143
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:52,852
- [Panting] Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

144
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:56,188
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

145
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:58,232
[Man] Sheriff! Help!

146
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,235
Alas.

147
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,198
Now we must act as our own bartender.

148
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:15,950
Sit down, my boy.

149
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,338
- What kind of dentist are you?
- [Chortles]

150
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:30,556
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

151
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,061
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

152
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:44,028
...Bounty Hunter.

153
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:46,572
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

154
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:47,781
No.

155
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,618
Well...

156
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:54,914
...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

157
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:57,416
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

158
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:03,380
[TsKing] Hat

159
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:12,924
prost.

160
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:15,935
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

161
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:18,771
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

162
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:22,900
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

163
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:25,778
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

164
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:28,739
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

165
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:30,616
I truly have killed him,

166
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:33,786
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

167
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,749
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

168
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,546
What's a bounty?

169
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:45,172
It's like a reward.

170
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:48,717
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

171
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:50,761
Certain people, yeah.

172
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:52,054
Bad people?

173
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:56,183
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

174
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:58,644
Which brings me to you.

175
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:03,065
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

176
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:05,651
On one hand, I despise slavery.

177
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:08,946
On the other hand, I need your help.

178
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,200
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

179
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,036
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

180
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:18,414
work to my benefit.

181
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,753
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

182
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:37,057
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

183
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:43,564
I'm looKing for the Brittle brothers.

184
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:45,065
However, at this endeavor,

185
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,447
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

186
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:54,491
But you do. Don't ya?

187
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:56,869
I know what they look like all right.

188
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:00,539
Good. So here's my agreement.

189
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,126
- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we goin'?

190
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:06,920
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

191
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:09,256
but I don't know where.

192
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:13,719
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

193
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,017
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

194
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:23,562
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

195
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:27,858
$25 per Brittle brother. That's $75.

196
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,407
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

197
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,328
[Scoffs]

198
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,461
Ok, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

199
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,092
- [Overlapping chatter]
- All right, folks, calm down.

200
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:55,594
Go about your business.

201
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,932
These jokers will be gone soon.

202
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:05,521
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

203
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:09,942
And scare all these nice people.

204
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:12,778
You ain't got nothing better to do

205
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:16,156
than to come into bill sharp's town

206
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:18,575
and show your ass?

207
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:20,494
- [Metal springing noise]
- [Sheriff screaming]

208
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:23,622
- [Crowd gasping]
- [Groaning]

209
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,750
[Woman screams]

210
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,131
- What'd you just do to our sheriff?
- [Groaning]

211
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:34,174
- [Yelling]
- [Shot echoing]

212

[Woman gasps]

213
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:41,974
[Crowd screaming]

214
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,811
Now you can get the marshal.

215
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:48,313
[Man] Marshal! Marshal!

216
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:50,733
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

217
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,403
After you.

218
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:58,782
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

219
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:01,827
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

220
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:04,163
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

221
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:06,665
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

222
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:09,793
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

223
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:13,964
Somebody get poor bill
outta the goddamn street.

224
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:16,300
You in the saloon!

225
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,345
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

226
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,349
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

227
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:27,019
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

228
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,105
and I mean right now.

229
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:33,692
[Schultz] Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

230
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:35,652
Yes, it is.

231
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:37,905
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

232
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:40,699
[Schultz]
Na wunderbar, marshal.

233
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:44,453
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

234
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:47,539
and just as you have instructed,

235
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:50,375
I am ready to step outside

236
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,547
with my hands raised above my head.

237
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:58,133
I trust as a representative

238
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:01,678
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

239
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:07,684
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

240
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:10,687
before I've had my day in court.

241
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:13,190
You mean like you did our sheriff.

242
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:15,150
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

243
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:17,653
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

244
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,662
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

245
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:30,082
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

246
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,127
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

247
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,924
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

248
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:41,260
They're a little tense out there.

249
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,055
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talKing.

250
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:54,773
- [Doors squeaKing open]
- Come ahead.

251
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:56,191
You unarmed?

252
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:58,652
[Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.

253
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:02,155
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

254
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:04,283
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

255
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,953
as to the incident that just occurred?

256
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:10,581
- Go on.
- Thank you.

257
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:12,875
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

258
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:16,295
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

259
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:19,882
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

260
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:24,136
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

261
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:28,891
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

262
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:31,643
with a price on his head of $200.

263
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:34,771
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

264
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:36,273
The hell, you say!

265
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:40,485
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

266
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:43,822
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

267
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,242
sometime in the past two years?

268
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:48,410
Yeah.

269
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,997
[Schultz] I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

270
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:55,626
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

271
00:22:59,421 --> 00:22:59,588
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

272
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,427
circuit court judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

273
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:07,304
You're encouraged to wire him.

274
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:12,517
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

275
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,525
[Guns uncocKing]

276
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:24,613
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

277
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:33,121
[Medium-tempo song plays]

278
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:42,623
I'll be damned.

279
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:06,405
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

280
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,746
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...

281
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,417
What's your plan after that?

282
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:24,506
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

283
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:29,886
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

284
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,347
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

285
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:36,101
Oh, me and my wife do.

286
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,481
Old man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

287
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:43,775

291

I got no use for a nigger with sand.

I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?

She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

311
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:10,070
She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.

She speak a little German, too.

313

- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.

314

When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

to speak German with.

No?

never break character.

Yeah. Don't break character.

is that of the valet.

Mr. Bennett?

349
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:10,500
I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.

350
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,253
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

351
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,092
to parley with you now.

352
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:22,345
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

353
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:24,306
You and your jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee

354
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:26,141
to buy one of my nigger gals?

355

No appointment, no nothin'?

Oh, I'm afraid so.

357

Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?

358
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:35,025
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

359
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:40,322
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

360
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,407
Now what you got to say about that?

00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:45,827
Mr. Bennett.

362
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,417
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

363
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,211
I have 5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

[Chuckles softly]

365
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,430

[Chuckles]

368
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:18,026
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

369
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:20,570
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

370
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:22,906
to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

371

and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

377

As you please, Big Daddy.

378
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:43,301
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

379
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:45,971
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

380
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:49,140
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

381
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,105
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
- Yes'm?

382
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:57,440
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

383
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,527
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

384
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:03,571
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

385
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:06,866
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

386
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:09,911
No. That's not what I said.

387
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:14,582
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

388

Yes, I can see that. Uh...

00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:32,392
- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.

394
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:39,149

I'm lookin' for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.

They could be usin' a different name.

this past year.

states dead or alive,

nobody shoot 'em.

521

That's way too simple for these jokers.

- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

532
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,467
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

533
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:34,428
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

534
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,805
I coulda cut it better than this!

535
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:40,309
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

536
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:43,979
Not too good.

537
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:46,232
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

538
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:48,442
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

539
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:50,403
- Shit.
- [Man] Yeah.

Anybody bring any extra bags?

543
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,994
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

545
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:03,624
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

Oh, well, shitfire!

547
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:08,629
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

550
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:17,346
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

551
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:21,267

criticize, criticize, criticize!

554
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:32,027
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

555
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:33,529
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

556
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:37,533
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

557
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,496
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

558
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:43,622
Ok, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

559
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:47,877
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

560
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:52,548
- Yeah.
- [Mumbling agreements]

561
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:57,720
But, not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

562
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:59,889
So how 'bout no bags this time,

563
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:03,392
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

564
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,561
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

565
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:06,812
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

566
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,856
But nobody can see.

567
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:13,777
So?

568
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:19,325
So it'd be nice to see.

[Animal yipping nearby]

596

How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

597
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:16,358
Broomhilda is a German name.

598
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:20,112
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

599
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:24,199
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

600
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:26,327
Broomhilda is the name of a character

601
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:28,203
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

602
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:37,713
There's a story about Broomhilda?

603
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:45,512
Oh, yes, there is.

604
00:46:47,014 --> 00:46:53,020
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.

605
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:58,942
Would you like me to tell you?

606
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:03,197
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

607
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:04,615
She was a daughter of Wotan,
God of all gods.

608
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:07,034
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

609
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,870
What she do?

610
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:13,207
I can't exactly remember.

611
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,000
She disobeys him in some way.

612
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,418
So he puts her on top of the Mountain.

613
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:19,380
Broomhilda's on a Mountain?

614
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:23,592
It's a German legend,

615
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,349
there's always going to be
a Mountain in there somewhere.

616
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:36,146
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the Mountain.

617
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:42,736
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

618
00:47:43,821 --> 00:47:45,406
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

619
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:48,534
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

620
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:50,744
Does a fella arise?

621
00:47:51,453 --> 00:47:52,454
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

622
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,251
A fella named Siegfried.

623
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:02,423
Does Siegfried save her?

624
00:48:03,132 --> 00:48:07,302
Quite spectacularly so.

625
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:09,972
He scales the Mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

626
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,685
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

627
00:48:18,814 --> 00:48:20,482
And he walks through hellfire...

628
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:24,820
...because Broomhilda's worth it.

629
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:34,496
I know how he feel.

630
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:41,462
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

631
00:48:42,588 --> 00:48:46,175
Now, look, Django...

632
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:51,680
...I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

633

...but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.

634

isn't the place for you to visit.

Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

636
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:13,619
But let me ask you a question.

637
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:15,788
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

638
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,373
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

639
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,376
What's not to like?

640
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:23,629
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

641
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:25,756
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

642
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:28,759
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

643
00:49:28,926 --> 00:49:30,928
but normally, that's a good thing.

644
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:35,390
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

645
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,393
What you mean "partner up"?

646
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:43,524
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

647
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,610
...I give you a third of my bounties.

648
00:49:46,777 --> 00:49:49,988
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

649
00:49:54,243 --> 00:49:55,994
I'll take you to Greenville myself

650
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:59,706
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

651
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:01,250
Why you care what happen to me?

652
00:50:02,543 --> 00:50:05,420
Why you care if I find my wife?

653
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:09,424
Frankly...

654
00:50:10,676 --> 00:50:14,388
...I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

655
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:19,810
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

656
00:50:19,977 --> 00:50:22,604
Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

657
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:32,531
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:55,203
[Calvin] Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!

857
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,998
[Man screaming]

858
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:03,044
[Calvin] There you go!

859
01:06:03,211 --> 01:06:05,254
There you go! Look at that.

860
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:06,881
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

861
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:09,342
Do what I told you, boy!

862
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:12,553
- There you go!
- [Bones cracKing]

863
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,806
- No!
- [Calvin] Do what I told ya!

864
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,475
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

865
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:24,607
[Man screaming]

866
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:26,400
- Oh, no, Luigi.
- [Screaming]

867
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:29,403
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- [Screaming]

868
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:34,492
Oh...

869
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:36,786
- [Panting]
- [Man continues screaming]

870
01:06:36,953 --> 01:06:38,246
[Playing pool]

871
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:44,293
[Screaming continues]

872
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:47,255
Finish him.

873
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:50,508
Go on, boy, finish him!

874
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:54,095
[Screaming halts]

875
01:06:54,262 --> 01:06:56,472
[Moguy] That's why they
call him big Fred.

876
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,642
- Worth every penny.
- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

877
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:01,978
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

878
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:24,292
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

879
01:07:34,302 --> 01:07:35,803
Mercedes.

880
01:07:37,972 --> 01:07:39,473
Tequila.

881
01:07:41,893 --> 01:07:43,561
What's your name?

882
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:49,734
Django.

883
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:52,737
Can you spell it?

884
01:07:52,904 --> 01:07:54,488
D-j-a-n-g-o.

885
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,288
The d is silent.

886
01:08:02,455 --> 01:08:05,958
I know.

887
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,835
[Speaks foreign language]

888
01:08:08,002 --> 01:08:10,588
[Calvin] Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

889
01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:13,507
You find him a room
with a soft bed,

890
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:14,675
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

891
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:18,721
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

892
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:25,561
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

893
01:08:25,728 --> 01:08:27,021
Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

894
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:40,326
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

895
01:08:40,493 --> 01:08:41,702
Yessir.

896
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,498
- What's your name, boy?
- His name is Django Freeman.

897
01:08:45,665 --> 01:08:48,918
[Calvin chuckles]

898
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:52,713
Where'd you dig him up?

899
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:56,217
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

900
01:08:56,384 --> 01:08:58,511
I've heard tell about you.

901
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:02,890
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

902
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:07,269
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

903
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,650
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

904
01:09:13,693 --> 01:09:15,027
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

905
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:17,071
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.

906
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:18,948
No offense given...

907
01:09:19,115 --> 01:09:22,618
...none taken.

908
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:24,245
[Schultz] Monsieur Candie...

909
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,999
...I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

910
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:31,002
One...

911
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,004
...you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

912
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,006
- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.

913
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,258
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

914
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:40,928
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

915
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:42,805
Do not spare the rum.

916
01:09:42,972 --> 01:09:48,102
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

917
01:09:49,562 --> 01:09:52,773
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

918
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:55,359
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

919
01:09:55,526 --> 01:09:57,653
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

920
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:00,364
...I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

921
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:03,075
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

922
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:05,619
at above top-dollar market price.

923
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,791
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

924
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:13,294
it would be to discuss business.

925
01:10:15,588 --> 01:10:16,589
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

926
01:10:16,756 --> 01:10:19,467
We were discussin' my curiosity.

927
01:10:21,469 --> 01:10:24,930
Thank you.

928
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:26,640
[Calvin] Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

929
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,895
Sheba... you stay right there.

930
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:35,608
I know you didn't mean me.

931
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,818
- Prost!
- German.

932
01:10:37,985 --> 01:10:40,404
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

933
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:44,325
I'm doing business with both y'all.

934
01:10:44,492 --> 01:10:45,659
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

935
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:47,953
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

936
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,039
Hm.

937
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:52,166
So...

938
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,502
...bright boy...

939
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:56,170
...Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

940
01:10:58,339 --> 01:11:00,382
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

941
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:02,676
Not for top dollar.

942
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:05,096
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

943
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:07,223
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

944
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:11,352
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

945
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:15,815
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

946
01:11:18,067 --> 01:11:21,737
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

947
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:24,323
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

948
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:28,160
Well, you won't sell your best.

949
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:32,248
You won't even sell your second best.

950
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,084
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

951
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:39,713
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

952
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:44,802
[Chortles]
...Who knows what could happen?

953
01:11:46,554 --> 01:11:48,597
And what do you consider ridiculous?

954
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:53,686
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

955
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:56,063
How much would you say, Django?

956
01:11:58,232 --> 01:12:02,236
Twelve thousand dollars.

957
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:04,321
[Straw slurping]

958
01:12:18,002 --> 01:12:23,674
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

959
01:12:23,841 --> 01:12:26,260
but now you have my attention.

960
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:30,347
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

961
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:33,392
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

962
01:12:33,559 --> 01:12:35,102
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.

963
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:37,396
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

964
01:12:45,613 --> 01:12:46,906
[Schultz]
Oh, thank you very much.

965
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:55,331
You can tie your horse up back there.

966
01:12:55,497 --> 01:13:00,669
[Calvin] Django.

967
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:04,965
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

968
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:09,803
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

969
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,472
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

970
01:13:12,473 --> 01:13:14,516
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

971
01:13:15,643 --> 01:13:16,810
The exceptional nigger.

972
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:19,855
Bright day, huh, bright boy?

973
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,529
Sun is up.

974
01:13:27,696 --> 01:13:28,989
Shining on all of us.

975
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:30,866
- [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.
- [Schultz] Thank you.

976
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:34,411
Quite an honor.

977
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:37,539
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

978
01:13:38,499 --> 01:13:40,334
[Calvin] But I do believe that,
given time,

979
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,212
exceptional niggers
like bright boy here...

980
01:13:44,964 --> 01:13:49,551
...become if not frequent...

981
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:52,596
...more frequent.

982
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,266
Bright boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

983
01:14:05,484 --> 01:14:06,860
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

984
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:11,782
[Men laughing]

985
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:13,867
- Whoa!
- [Whinnying]

986
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:15,077
- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

987
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:17,246
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

988
01:14:17,413 --> 01:14:19,957
Are you kidding me?

989
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,836
- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

990
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:28,048
Now take your hand off your pistol!

991
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:31,760
Butch, that means you too.

992
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:34,054
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

993
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:38,517
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

994
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:41,729
He broke my collarbone!

995
01:14:43,105 --> 01:14:43,272
For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

996
01:14:45,733 --> 01:14:45,900
- [Man] Yessir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

997
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:48,527
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

998
01:14:50,154 --> 01:14:50,321
Oh, I'm gonna go
walKing in the moonlight with you.

999
01:14:52,323 --> 01:14:52,490
You wanna hold my hand?

1000
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:54,283
[Chuckling]

1001
01:14:56,953 --> 01:14:59,205
[Rap song playing]

1002
01:15:01,207 --> 01:15:07,588
[ClucKing]

1003
01:15:08,839 --> 01:15:16,839
Willie, take us home.

1004
01:15:56,012 --> 01:15:56,178
[Man] Start moving!

1005
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,596
Head 'em out!

1006
01:15:59,098 --> 01:16:00,307
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

1007
01:16:01,267 --> 01:16:01,434
No, sir.

1008
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:04,645
You want a boot heel in it?

1009
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:07,940
No, sir.

1010
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:10,026
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

1011
01:16:11,444 --> 01:16:11,610
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

1012
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:13,904
Now move, nigger!

1013
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:15,948
[Horse snorting]

1014
01:16:19,535 --> 01:16:19,702
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

1015
01:16:22,747 --> 01:16:22,913
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

1016
01:16:24,248 --> 01:16:26,751
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1017
01:16:30,129 --> 01:16:30,296
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he? [Chuckles]

1018
01:16:34,008 --> 01:16:34,175
Indeed.

1019
01:16:37,261 --> 01:16:37,428
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1020
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:44,769
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1021
01:16:46,604 --> 01:16:46,771
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1022
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:52,860
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1023
01:16:55,446 --> 01:16:55,613
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1024
01:16:58,991 --> 01:16:59,158
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

1025
01:17:01,035 --> 01:17:01,202
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

1026
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:03,829
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

1027
01:17:08,459 --> 01:17:08,626
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1028
01:17:10,586 --> 01:17:10,753
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

1029
01:17:12,546 --> 01:17:12,713
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

1030
01:17:15,216 --> 01:17:15,382
You lose sight of why we're here.

1031
01:17:20,346 --> 01:17:20,513
- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.

1032
01:17:25,184 --> 01:17:25,351
Stop antagonizing Candie.

1033
01:17:28,354 --> 01:17:28,521
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

1034
01:17:31,065 --> 01:17:32,066
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Miss.issippi, USA.

1035
01:17:37,488 --> 01:17:37,655
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

1036
01:17:39,448 --> 01:17:40,866
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

1037
01:17:41,992 --> 01:17:44,245
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

1038
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:45,746
and he didn't bat a eye.

1039
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:50,167
You remember that?

1040
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:53,170
Yeah, of course I remember.

1041
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:59,718
What you said was that
this is my world...

1042
01:18:02,888 --> 01:18:04,348
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

1043
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:06,934
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

1044
01:18:08,102 --> 01:18:10,187
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1045
01:18:11,689 --> 01:18:19,405
...that was the general gist.

1046
01:18:21,991 --> 01:18:23,284
[Sighing]

1047
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:33,327
See you at Candyland.

1048
01:18:36,797 --> 01:18:44,797
[Django]
All right, niggers, back at it.

1049
01:19:04,116 --> 01:19:12,116
That means you too, moonlight.

[Calvin] I'll be. D'Artagnan!

1053
01:19:22,718 --> 01:19:22,885
Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

1054
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:26,597
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

1055
01:19:29,016 --> 01:19:29,183
[Calvin] Yes, you can.

1056
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:31,977
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

1057
01:19:34,021 --> 01:19:34,188
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

1058
01:19:35,731 --> 01:19:35,898
- I cannot hear myself think!
- Quiet down, Marsha!

1059
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:38,692
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

1060
01:19:40,945 --> 01:19:48,035
Hush up! Hey!

1061
01:19:51,497 --> 01:19:51,664
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

1062

[Dogs whining]

1063
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:59,797
Come on now, boy...
Get on out that tree.

1064
01:20:01,173 --> 01:20:09,173
Yessir.

1065

[Dogs resume barKing]

1066
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:21,610
[BarKing stops]

1067
01:20:23,237 --> 01:20:24,363
How long was he loose?

1068
01:20:25,906 --> 01:20:26,073
[Speech slurred]
A night. Day.

1069
01:20:27,783 --> 01:20:27,950
Half the other night.

1070
01:20:30,077 --> 01:20:30,244
How far he get off the property?

1071
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,871
'Bout 20 Miles off the prop.

1072
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:36,375
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

1073
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:39,169
Hm.

1074
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,047
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1075
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:44,717
One-a this new lot.

1076
01:20:46,218 --> 01:20:46,385
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

1077
01:20:48,804 --> 01:20:48,971
[D'Artagnan weeping] Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

1078
01:20:51,432 --> 01:20:54,893
- Now, now, now, now, now.
- I can't...

1079
01:20:57,438 --> 01:21:00,357
Now, no beggin'.

1080

No playin' on my soft heart.

1081
01:21:08,949 --> 01:21:09,116
- You in trouble now, son.
- Yessir.

1082
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:11,660
I done paid $500 for you.

1083
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:15,706
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

1084
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:18,584
- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.

1085
01:21:20,085 --> 01:21:20,252
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

1086
01:21:23,255 --> 01:21:23,422
- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

1087
01:21:24,465 --> 01:21:27,134
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

1088
01:21:29,178 --> 01:21:29,345
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

1089
01:21:32,973 --> 01:21:33,140
Yessir.

1090
01:21:35,684 --> 01:21:37,561
Still, the fact remains:

1091
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,023
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1092
01:21:47,029 --> 01:21:49,406
So what about my $500, huh?

1093
01:21:49,573 --> 01:21:51,617
What about my $500?

1094

You gonna reimburse me?

1095

- [Laughing]
- [Calvin] Huh?

You will?

1100

Yep.

for practically a One-Eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1103
01:22:25,109 --> 01:22:27,570
No, he won't.

1104
01:22:27,736 --> 01:22:29,530
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1105
01:22:31,282 --> 01:22:32,491
Matter of fact, so am I.

1106
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:45,421
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1107
01:22:45,588 --> 01:22:49,258
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1108
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:52,011
You heard him.

1109
01:22:54,263 --> 01:22:55,723
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1110
01:22:56,724 --> 01:22:58,058
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1111
01:22:59,351 --> 01:23:00,936
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1112
01:23:07,026 --> 01:23:08,193
That right.

1113
01:23:09,361 --> 01:23:12,489
[Calvin] For that matter...

1114
01:23:14,992 --> 01:23:18,329
...nor have I.

1115

for this pickaninny here...

green around the gills

Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

Hm.

You are used to it?

I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

oughta show them every hospitality.

- Yessir. Him I understand.

Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1181
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,096
- In the big house?
- Well, you got a problem with that?

1182
01:29:51,263 --> 01:29:53,515
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1183
01:29:53,682 --> 01:29:55,892
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1184
01:29:56,059 --> 01:29:57,978
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1185
01:29:58,145 --> 01:29:59,771
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1186
01:30:01,898 --> 01:30:03,817
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1187
01:30:05,277 --> 01:30:06,445
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1188
01:30:07,362 --> 01:30:09,781

01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:14,995
Go on, now.

1191
01:30:15,162 --> 01:30:16,330
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in the big house.

1192
01:30:16,496 --> 01:30:21,168
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1193
01:30:21,335 --> 01:30:24,421
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1194
01:30:24,588 --> 01:30:29,634
Now...

1195
01:30:29,801 --> 01:30:33,805
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1196
01:30:35,057 --> 01:30:38,435
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1197
01:30:38,602 --> 01:30:41,980
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1198
01:30:42,147 --> 01:30:44,274
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1199
01:30:44,441 --> 01:30:45,484
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1200
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,402
Chester, Rodney, chicken charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1201
01:30:48,612 --> 01:30:51,365
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1202
01:30:52,074 --> 01:30:55,077
You know where it is.

1203
01:30:55,243 --> 01:30:59,039
Like you on a rope!

1204
01:30:59,206 --> 01:31:00,165
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1205
01:31:00,332 --> 01:31:03,335
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1206
01:31:03,502 --> 01:31:06,088
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talKing about?

1207
01:31:06,254 --> 01:31:10,425
Nigger gal?

1208
01:31:10,592 --> 01:31:14,763
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1209
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:18,308
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1210
01:31:18,475 --> 01:31:20,310
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1211
01:31:20,477 --> 01:31:21,895
[Laughs] You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1212
01:31:22,062 --> 01:31:23,730
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1213
01:31:23,897 --> 01:31:26,566
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1214
01:31:26,775 --> 01:31:30,445
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1215
01:31:31,947 --> 01:31:33,115
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1216
01:31:33,281 --> 01:31:36,034
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1217
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:37,661
- What?
- [Stammers] Uh, Hildi in the hot box.

1218
01:31:37,828 --> 01:31:40,163
[Calvin] What's she doin' there?

1219
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:42,999
[Stephen] What you think she
doin' there in the hot box?

1220
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:45,669
She bein' punished.

1221
01:31:45,836 --> 01:31:48,338
- [Calvin] What she do?
- [Stephen] She run off again.

1222
01:31:48,505 --> 01:31:51,174
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1223
01:31:52,092 --> 01:31:55,595
- Two.
- When did she go?

1224
01:31:55,762 --> 01:32:00,058
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1225
01:32:00,225 --> 01:32:03,145
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1226
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:04,521
[Stephen] Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1227
01:32:04,688 --> 01:32:06,356
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1228
01:32:06,523 --> 01:32:09,317
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1229
01:32:09,484 --> 01:32:12,154
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1230
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:15,365
[Calvin]
How long she been in the box?

1231
01:32:15,532 --> 01:32:19,453
[Stephen] How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1232
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:20,579
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1233
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:23,915
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1234
01:32:24,082 --> 01:32:27,294
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1235
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:29,880
Hildi is my nigger.

1236
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:32,507
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1237
01:32:32,674 --> 01:32:36,845
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1238
01:32:37,012 --> 01:32:38,180
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1239
01:32:39,473 --> 01:32:42,058
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1240
01:32:42,225 --> 01:32:45,604
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1241
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:47,147
Yessir.

1242
01:32:47,314 --> 01:32:52,194
[Calvin] Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1243
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,238
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1244
01:32:57,699 --> 01:32:59,910
[Lara lee] Of course, darlin'.

1245
01:33:00,076 --> 01:33:02,829
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1246
01:33:02,996 --> 01:33:05,540
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1247
01:33:05,707 --> 01:33:08,752
[ClucKing]

1248
01:33:08,919 --> 01:33:11,296
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1249
01:33:11,463 --> 01:33:13,924
Cora! Come here!

1250
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:17,469
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1251
01:33:58,343 --> 01:34:00,220
- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.

1252
01:34:01,054 --> 01:34:03,765
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1253
01:34:04,975 --> 01:34:06,351
- Yessir.
- [Soft guitar music plays]

1254
01:34:06,518 --> 01:34:10,063
[Hildi screams]

1255
01:34:11,356 --> 01:34:13,817
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1256
01:34:33,795 --> 01:34:37,340
[Hildi yelling]

1257
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:42,721
[Gasping screaming]

1258
01:34:46,266 --> 01:34:48,893
[Sobbing]

1259
01:36:04,594 --> 01:36:05,762
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1260
01:36:12,519 --> 01:36:13,978
[Slow-tempo song plays]

1261
01:36:14,145 --> 01:36:17,524

[Exhales]

1263
01:36:25,615 --> 01:36:27,742
Hello, ladies.

1264
01:36:28,785 --> 01:36:31,121
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1265
01:36:31,287 --> 01:36:34,082
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1266
01:36:34,249 --> 01:36:36,167
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1267
01:36:37,335 --> 01:36:39,337
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1268
01:36:39,504 --> 01:36:44,467
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1269
01:36:47,804 --> 01:36:50,140
- [Chuckles]
- [Forced chuckle]

1270
01:36:52,142 --> 01:36:54,102
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1271
01:36:55,645 --> 01:36:57,814
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1272
01:36:59,941 --> 01:37:03,570
The doctor here speaks German.

1273
01:37:04,362 --> 01:37:05,989
And I've been informed you do as well?

1274
01:37:06,156 --> 01:37:08,158
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1275
01:37:08,324 --> 01:37:09,993
[Speaking German]

1276
01:37:15,123 --> 01:37:17,333
Ha! [Laughs]

1277
01:37:26,843 --> 01:37:27,969
Astonishing.

1278
01:37:48,615 --> 01:37:50,200
[Speaking German]

1279
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:52,827
- And I shall bring you...
- [Schultz] Much obliged.

1280
01:38:30,907 --> 01:38:33,409
Ja.

1281
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,293
[Speaks German]

1282
01:39:26,129 --> 01:39:27,755
Don't be afraid.

1283
01:40:10,548 --> 01:40:12,592
Hm. Pardon.

1284
01:40:27,732 --> 01:40:29,317
Danke.

1285
01:40:29,901 --> 01:40:31,486
[Chuckling]

1286
01:40:33,905 --> 01:40:35,073
[Repeats German phrase]

1287
01:40:37,909 --> 01:40:41,204
Hey, little trouble maker.

1288
01:40:42,789 --> 01:40:44,123
[Gasping]

1289
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:45,541
[Moaning]

1290
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:48,670
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1291
01:40:48,836 --> 01:40:51,589
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss. Cora.

1292
01:40:51,756 --> 01:40:53,967
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1293
01:40:54,133 --> 01:40:56,719
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1294
01:40:56,886 --> 01:41:02,684
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.

1295
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:07,230
[Laughs] That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1296
01:41:08,606 --> 01:41:10,191
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1297
01:41:10,358 --> 01:41:13,695
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1298
01:41:13,861 --> 01:41:16,447
But the best three by far were samson...

1299
01:41:16,614 --> 01:41:19,701
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1300
01:41:19,867 --> 01:41:22,453
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1301
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,622
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1302
01:41:26,124 --> 01:41:31,462
[Chuckles] You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1303
01:41:31,629 --> 01:41:35,341
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1304
01:41:35,508 --> 01:41:39,262
[All laugh]

1305
01:41:39,929 --> 01:41:42,015
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1306
01:41:42,181 --> 01:41:43,975
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1307
01:41:45,268 --> 01:41:46,769
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1308
01:41:46,936 --> 01:41:48,062
Samson's the champion.

1309
01:41:48,229 --> 01:41:50,314
Them other two pretty good.

1310
01:41:50,481 --> 01:41:53,860
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1311
01:41:54,027 --> 01:41:58,322
It's all right.

1312
01:41:58,489 --> 01:41:59,574
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1313
01:41:59,741 --> 01:42:03,828
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1314
01:42:03,995 --> 01:42:04,954
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1315
01:42:05,121 --> 01:42:07,582
Is that right?

1316
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:11,544
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1317
01:42:11,711 --> 01:42:14,797
Hm.

1318
01:42:14,964 --> 01:42:17,717
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1319
01:42:17,884 --> 01:42:21,095
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1320
01:42:21,262 --> 01:42:22,889
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1321
01:42:23,056 --> 01:42:24,432
- A sense of showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1322
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:25,600
I want to be able to bill him
as the black Hercules.

1323
01:42:25,767 --> 01:42:27,894
[All chuckling]

1324
01:42:28,061 --> 01:42:33,441
The black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1325
01:42:33,941 --> 01:42:36,736
More like nigger-les.

1326
01:42:36,903 --> 01:42:41,199
[Laughing]

1327
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:44,077
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1328
01:42:45,328 --> 01:42:46,746
...'the right nigger."'

1329
01:42:46,913 --> 01:42:50,708
now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1330
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:52,794
But is he right as rain?

1331
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,712
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1332
01:42:54,879 --> 01:42:55,880
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1333
01:42:56,047 --> 01:42:57,882
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1334
01:42:58,049 --> 01:42:59,425
more than Monsieur
Calvin j. Candie here.

1335
01:42:59,592 --> 01:43:01,594
Nobody.

1336
01:43:01,761 --> 01:43:02,970
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1337
01:43:03,137 --> 01:43:07,350
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1338
01:43:07,517 --> 01:43:09,560
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1339
01:43:09,727 --> 01:43:13,689
Hm-mm.

1340
01:43:13,856 --> 01:43:16,400
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1341
01:43:16,567 --> 01:43:18,027
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1342
01:43:22,865 --> 01:43:24,492
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1343
01:43:25,701 --> 01:43:29,080
In other words, first thing is first.

1344
01:43:29,247 --> 01:43:31,124
First thing's first.

1345
01:43:31,874 --> 01:43:34,544
[Whispers in German]

1346
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:38,047
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1347
01:43:38,214 --> 01:43:40,049
Famously.

1348
01:43:40,216 --> 01:43:42,301
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1349
01:43:42,468 --> 01:43:44,512
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1350
01:43:44,679 --> 01:43:47,473
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1351
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,350
[Laughing]

1352
01:43:49,517 --> 01:43:54,730
Two weeks in Boston!

1353
01:43:54,897 --> 01:43:58,985
- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
- [Coughing]

1354
01:43:59,152 --> 01:44:01,028
[Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!

1355
01:44:01,195 --> 01:44:02,530
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1356
01:44:02,697 --> 01:44:03,948
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1357
01:44:04,115 --> 01:44:06,200
[Calvin] Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1358
01:44:06,367 --> 01:44:08,369
You might-a caught yourself

1359
01:44:08,536 --> 01:44:10,163
- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1360
01:44:10,329 --> 01:44:13,291
[Calvin] Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1361
01:44:13,457 --> 01:44:15,001
- [Stephen] Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.

1362
01:44:15,168 --> 01:44:17,420
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1363
01:44:17,587 --> 01:44:22,091
Yessir, you stuck. [Laughs]

1364
01:44:23,217 --> 01:44:23,384
[Lara lee] I don't know, doctor.

1365
01:44:25,845 --> 01:44:26,012
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1366
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:29,807
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1367
01:44:32,602 --> 01:44:32,769
[Lara Lee giggles]

1368
01:44:35,271 --> 01:44:35,438
Well, naturally.

1369
01:44:37,356 --> 01:44:37,523
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1370
01:44:38,566 --> 01:44:38,733
- not the plucked chicken.
- [All chuckle]

1371
01:44:40,735 --> 01:44:40,902
[Calvin] Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1372
01:44:43,112 --> 01:44:44,030
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1373
01:44:45,323 --> 01:44:45,490
[Cora] You got to clean these dishes,

1374
01:44:48,576 --> 01:44:50,328
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1375
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:52,497
You know that nigger, don't you?

1376
01:44:53,748 --> 01:44:53,915
- Who?
- "Who?"

1377
01:44:56,959 --> 01:44:57,126
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1378
01:44:59,962 --> 01:45:02,048
At the table?

1379
01:45:03,132 --> 01:45:04,592
I don't know him.

1380
01:45:07,053 --> 01:45:11,265
- You don't know him.
- No.

1381
01:45:12,475 --> 01:45:13,726
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1382
01:45:16,854 --> 01:45:23,319
[Chuckles]

1383
01:45:26,739 --> 01:45:28,116
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1384
01:45:33,287 --> 01:45:33,454
Ok.

1385
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:35,957
Yeah. If you say so.

1386
01:45:37,917 --> 01:45:38,084
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1387
01:45:41,546 --> 01:45:42,505
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1388
01:45:45,758 --> 01:45:47,009
What would your price be?

1389
01:45:52,807 --> 01:45:52,974
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1390
01:45:55,143 --> 01:45:55,309
...and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1391
01:45:56,269 --> 01:45:56,435
...9,000. Maybe.

1392
01:45:58,146 --> 01:45:58,312
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1393
01:46:00,481 --> 01:46:00,648
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1394
01:46:03,067 --> 01:46:03,234
Sure wasn't.

1395
01:46:04,861 --> 01:46:05,027
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1396
01:46:07,989 --> 01:46:08,156
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure

1397
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:13,035
bright boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1398
01:46:17,039 --> 01:46:17,206
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1399
01:46:20,042 --> 01:46:24,714
- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.

1400
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:28,217
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1401
01:46:32,305 --> 01:46:32,471
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1402
01:46:33,764 --> 01:46:36,225
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1403
01:46:38,644 --> 01:46:38,811
[Deep inhale]

1404
01:46:42,148 --> 01:46:42,315
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1405
01:46:44,442 --> 01:46:44,609
[Chuckles]

1406
01:46:48,154 --> 01:46:48,321
[Slamming table] Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1407
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:51,657
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- [Banging table] Hooray, doctor.

1408
01:46:53,451 --> 01:46:53,618
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1409
01:46:56,704 --> 01:46:56,871
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1410
01:46:59,916 --> 01:47:00,082
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1411
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:01,250
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1412
01:47:02,919 --> 01:47:03,085
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1413
01:47:05,713 --> 01:47:05,880
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1414
01:47:10,593 --> 01:47:12,762
Hm-mm.

1415
01:47:15,056 --> 01:47:15,223
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1416
01:47:16,474 --> 01:47:16,641
- by a physician of my choosing.
- [Calvin] Naturally.

1417
01:47:18,684 --> 01:47:18,851
So, say I return in about...

1418
01:47:21,812 --> 01:47:22,647
- ...five days time.
- Five days?

1419
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:26,442
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1420
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:28,611
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1421
01:47:30,613 --> 01:47:32,990
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1422
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:38,037
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1423
01:47:40,706 --> 01:47:40,873
Gentlemen...

1424
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:42,416
...may I propose a toast.

1425
01:47:43,834 --> 01:47:44,001
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him the black Hercules?

1426
01:47:47,838 --> 01:47:48,005
- [All chuckling]
- To the black Hercules.

1427
01:47:49,423 --> 01:47:49,590
[Stephen] The black Hercules.

1428
01:47:52,843 --> 01:47:55,930
[Speaks low]
To the black Hercules.

1429
01:48:00,977 --> 01:48:01,143
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass. [Chuckles]

1430
01:48:04,355 --> 01:48:04,522
Hm.

1431
01:48:07,275 --> 01:48:07,441
Hildi, top my drink off.

1432
01:48:10,194 --> 01:48:10,361
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in the big house, huh?

1433
01:48:11,696 --> 01:48:11,862
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1434
01:48:14,949 --> 01:48:15,116
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1435
01:48:16,701 --> 01:48:16,867
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that hot box or draggin' your ass

1436
01:48:18,035 --> 01:48:18,202
through a bramble bush.

1437
01:48:19,662 --> 01:48:19,829
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1438
01:48:21,163 --> 01:48:21,330
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, lord, she like them niggers.

1439
01:48:25,001 --> 01:48:25,167
- Sure do.
- Like samson? Huh?

1440
01:48:28,421 --> 01:48:28,587
[Hildi] No, sir.

1441
01:48:30,715 --> 01:48:30,881
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1442
01:48:33,926 --> 01:48:34,093
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1443
01:48:35,845 --> 01:48:36,012
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1444
01:48:38,389 --> 01:48:38,556
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1445
01:48:40,349 --> 01:48:40,516
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1446
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:42,727
No, we just talked and...

1447
01:48:45,813 --> 01:48:45,980
[Calvin] Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1448
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:48,107
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1449
01:48:50,484 --> 01:48:50,651
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1450
01:48:53,571 --> 01:48:53,738
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1451
01:48:56,741 --> 01:48:56,907
- Go on.
- [Lara lee] Uh, Calvin.

1452
01:48:59,493 --> 01:48:59,660
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1453
01:49:03,247 --> 01:49:03,414
[Calvin] But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1454
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:05,750
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1455
01:49:07,668 --> 01:49:07,877
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1456
01:49:08,961 --> 01:49:09,128
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1457
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:12,173
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1458
01:49:15,217 --> 01:49:16,886
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1459
01:49:19,305 --> 01:49:19,472
- [Stephen] Sure would.
- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.

1460
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:23,351
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
- Calvin!

1461
01:49:25,144 --> 01:49:31,525
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1462
01:49:33,069 --> 01:49:33,235
- [Exhales]
- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1463
01:49:34,904 --> 01:49:36,530
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1464
01:49:39,742 --> 01:49:39,909
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1465
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:42,536
[Lara lee]
Cora, come get this girl!

1466
01:49:43,871 --> 01:49:50,378
[Approaching footsteps]

1467
01:49:54,173 --> 01:49:54,340
- [Lara lee] She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. [Gasps] Oh!

1468
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,426
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1469
01:49:58,511 --> 01:49:58,677
Come on in here.

1470
01:50:04,266 --> 01:50:05,434
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1471
01:50:08,813 --> 01:50:10,981
You say you ain't know him.

1472
01:50:12,608 --> 01:50:13,609
Huh?

1473
01:50:13,776 --> 01:50:16,278
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1474
01:50:18,656 --> 01:50:19,990
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1475
01:50:20,157 --> 01:50:22,660
Mr. Stephen...

1476
01:50:22,827 --> 01:50:24,995
...I don't.

1477
01:50:25,162 --> 01:50:29,083
Why is you lying to me?

1478
01:50:30,751 --> 01:50:33,838
I ain't.

1479
01:50:34,004 --> 01:50:37,133
Then why is you crying?

1480
01:50:37,299 --> 01:50:40,177
You scarin' me.

1481
01:50:40,344 --> 01:50:43,180
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1482
01:50:48,519 --> 01:50:53,023
[Schultz] To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1483
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:56,026
was positively soul-enriching.

1484
01:50:58,028 --> 01:51:03,993
[Calvin] Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1485
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:05,536
You stay right here.

1486
01:51:05,703 --> 01:51:07,413
[Schultz] You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1487
01:51:08,038 --> 01:51:09,623
Why,yes.
Yessiree Bob, I did.

1488
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:13,127
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1489
01:51:14,253 --> 01:51:16,380
I'm all ears.

1490
01:51:16,547 --> 01:51:19,258
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1491
01:51:19,425 --> 01:51:20,551
- Monsieur Candie...
- [Calvin] Stephen!

1492
01:51:20,718 --> 01:51:24,472
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1493
01:51:24,638 --> 01:51:26,557
[Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1494
01:51:26,724 --> 01:51:30,060
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1495
01:51:30,227 --> 01:51:34,064
Excuse him.

1496
01:51:34,231 --> 01:51:36,859
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1497
01:51:37,026 --> 01:51:38,903
You mean get up out of my chair?

1498
01:51:39,069 --> 01:51:41,405
- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1499
01:51:41,572 --> 01:51:45,910
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1500
01:51:46,076 --> 01:51:47,870
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1501
01:51:48,037 --> 01:51:51,123
We're having white cake!

1502
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:53,167
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1503
01:51:53,334 --> 01:51:58,339
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1504
01:51:58,506 --> 01:51:59,673
[Whispers] Meet me in the library.

1505
01:52:00,591 --> 01:52:04,261
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1506
01:52:04,428 --> 01:52:06,180
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1507
01:52:06,347 --> 01:52:09,975
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1508
01:52:10,142 --> 01:52:11,435
Yessir.

1509
01:52:12,978 --> 01:52:14,772
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1510
01:52:20,945 --> 01:52:22,738
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1511
01:52:24,198 --> 01:52:27,576
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1512
01:52:27,743 --> 01:52:33,165
[All chuckle]

1513
01:52:33,332 --> 01:52:36,001
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1514
01:52:36,168 --> 01:52:37,670
[Calvin] You may clear
the dinner service.

1515
01:52:42,466 --> 01:52:44,260
[Cora] You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1516
01:52:49,515 --> 01:52:54,603
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1517
01:52:54,770 --> 01:52:58,315
[Chuckles] The circus?

1518
01:52:58,482 --> 01:53:01,235
[Fire crackling]

1519
01:53:01,402 --> 01:53:04,572
What is the matter?

1520
01:53:04,738 --> 01:53:08,409
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1521
01:53:08,576 --> 01:53:10,744
- They wants that girl.
- [Chuckling]

1522
01:53:10,911 --> 01:53:13,539
Stephen, what the hell
are you talKing about? Hm?

1523
01:53:13,706 --> 01:53:17,334
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talKing about.

1524
01:53:19,044 --> 01:53:20,629
They ain't here for
no musclebound jimmie.

1525
01:53:20,796 --> 01:53:23,173
They here for that girl.

1526
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:25,801
Wh... what girl? Hildi?

1527
01:53:25,968 --> 01:53:28,220
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1528
01:53:28,387 --> 01:53:31,599
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1529
01:53:31,765 --> 01:53:34,768
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1530
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:42,192
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1531
01:53:43,319 --> 01:53:45,112
But he's just about to buy

1532
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:47,781
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1533
01:53:47,948 --> 01:53:52,244
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1534
01:53:52,411 --> 01:53:54,246
Where you gettin' all this?

1535
01:53:54,413 --> 01:53:57,207
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1536
01:53:57,374 --> 01:54:00,461
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1537
01:54:03,047 --> 01:54:05,007
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1538
01:54:05,591 --> 01:54:09,887
She probably his wife.

1539
01:54:10,054 --> 01:54:13,557
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1540
01:54:13,724 --> 01:54:19,188
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1541
01:54:21,899 --> 01:54:23,567
If she's who they want...

1542
01:54:26,904 --> 01:54:28,530
...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1543
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:36,121
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1544
01:54:36,288 --> 01:54:37,706
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1545
01:54:39,416 --> 01:54:41,418
Yes, it did.

1546
01:54:42,252 --> 01:54:48,258
His wife, huh?

1547
01:54:50,469 --> 01:54:51,637
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1548
01:54:52,262 --> 01:54:57,059
[Chuckles]

1549
01:54:58,310 --> 01:54:59,770
Those lying...

1550
01:54:59,937 --> 01:55:02,731
...goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1551
01:55:02,898 --> 01:55:04,358
Sons of bitches!

1552
01:55:04,525 --> 01:55:06,694
...out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1553
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:09,947
Oh, there you are.

1554
01:55:10,114 --> 01:55:13,158
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1555
01:55:13,325 --> 01:55:14,410
[All chuckling]

1556
01:55:14,576 --> 01:55:18,455
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1557
01:55:18,622 --> 01:55:20,874
Lara Lee, I was just
looKing out the big window.

1558
01:55:34,138 --> 01:55:37,850
Billy crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1559
01:55:39,893 --> 01:55:42,813
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1560
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:46,984
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1561
01:55:47,151 --> 01:55:50,070
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1562
01:55:50,237 --> 01:55:52,364
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1563
01:56:08,839 --> 01:56:10,883
Apropos, before your exit,

1564
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:14,303
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1565
01:56:15,846 --> 01:56:17,347
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1566
01:56:18,682 --> 01:56:23,687
And we will again. In a moment.

1567
01:56:23,854 --> 01:56:26,273
Who's your little friend?

1568
01:56:27,357 --> 01:56:31,111
[Clearing throat]

1569
01:56:31,987 --> 01:56:34,031
This is Ben.

1570
01:56:34,198 --> 01:56:36,784
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1571
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:41,288
And I do mean a long damn time.

1572
01:56:43,874 --> 01:56:47,669
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1573
01:56:47,836 --> 01:56:53,717
...and my daddy's daddy.

1574
01:56:55,344 --> 01:57:00,641
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1575
01:57:01,892 --> 01:57:05,687
...old Ben took care of me.

1576
01:57:07,731 --> 01:57:10,067
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Miss.issippi

1577
01:57:10,234 --> 01:57:13,403
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1578
01:57:17,115 --> 01:57:19,576
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1579
01:57:22,579 --> 01:57:27,751
...surrounded by black faces.

1580
01:57:27,918 --> 01:57:32,840
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1581
01:57:33,006 --> 01:57:38,136
I only had one question:

1582
01:57:38,303 --> 01:57:41,723
- Why don't they kill us?
- [Laughs]

1583
01:57:44,268 --> 01:57:45,769
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1584
01:57:47,646 --> 01:57:48,939
old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1585
01:57:50,315 --> 01:57:55,112
Now, if I was old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1586
01:57:55,279 --> 01:58:00,367
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1587
01:58:02,202 --> 01:58:05,914
But he never did.

1588
01:58:06,081 --> 01:58:08,208
Why not?

1589
01:58:08,375 --> 01:58:13,881
You see, the science of phrenology

1590
01:58:14,965 --> 01:58:16,633
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1591
01:58:29,396 --> 01:58:31,356
In the skull of the African here,

1592
01:58:32,733 --> 01:58:34,902
the area associated
with subMiss.iveness

1593
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:44,786
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet earth.

1594
01:58:48,498 --> 01:58:48,665
[Sawing]

1595
01:58:49,916 --> 01:58:50,083
If you examine...

1596
01:58:55,088 --> 01:58:55,255
...this piece of skull here...

1597
01:58:57,758 --> 01:58:57,924
...you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1598
01:59:01,261 --> 01:59:01,928
Here, here and here.

1599
01:59:03,764 --> 01:59:04,389
Now...

1600
01:59:06,516 --> 01:59:06,683
...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1601
01:59:08,977 --> 01:59:09,144
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1602
01:59:13,315 --> 01:59:14,441
most associated with... creativity.

1603
01:59:15,776 --> 01:59:16,777
But this is the skull of old Ben.

1604
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,446
And in the skull of old Ben,

1605
01:59:21,615 --> 01:59:24,076
unburdened by genius,

1606
01:59:26,161 --> 01:59:28,288
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1607
01:59:30,624 --> 01:59:31,625
...servility.

1608
01:59:36,963 --> 01:59:38,215
Now, bright boy...

1609
01:59:39,674 --> 01:59:40,801
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1610
01:59:44,388 --> 01:59:44,554
But if I took this hammer here...

1611
01:59:47,516 --> 01:59:47,682
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1612
01:59:50,936 --> 01:59:52,020
...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1613
01:59:55,148 --> 01:59:55,315
...as old Ben.

1614
01:59:57,651 --> 01:59:57,818
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1615
02:00:00,612 --> 02:00:00,779
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1616
02:00:03,156 --> 02:00:07,869
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1617
02:00:10,288 --> 02:00:14,835
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1618
02:00:16,211 --> 02:00:20,674
but that you can believe!

1619
02:00:22,092 --> 02:00:26,096
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1620
02:00:27,597 --> 02:00:27,764
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1621
02:00:30,517 --> 02:00:30,684
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1622
02:00:33,145 --> 02:00:33,311
Where were we?

1623
02:00:34,688 --> 02:00:38,692
Jackass.

1624
02:00:40,026 --> 02:00:42,446
Ah, yes.

1625
02:00:43,947 --> 02:00:46,700
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1626
02:00:48,243 --> 02:00:49,703
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1627
02:00:51,955 --> 02:00:52,122
Am I right?

1628
02:00:53,373 --> 02:00:53,540
Right.

1629
02:00:55,083 --> 02:00:59,379
Bring out Hildi!

1630
02:01:01,965 --> 02:01:02,132
Get over there yonder.

1631
02:01:04,885 --> 02:01:05,051
- [Screams]
- Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1632
02:01:09,389 --> 02:01:09,556
[Stephen] Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1633
02:01:12,601 --> 02:01:12,767
[Calvin] Now shut your mouth!

1634
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:17,522
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1635
02:01:19,274 --> 02:01:19,441
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1636
02:01:21,401 --> 02:01:21,568
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1637
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:25,697
To which me myself said,
"what is your definition of ridiculous?"

1638
02:01:28,116 --> 02:01:28,283
To which you said, "$12,000."

1639
02:01:34,247 --> 02:01:34,414
- [Yells]
- Now, considering y'all

1640
02:01:38,168 --> 02:01:38,335
have ridden a whole lot of Miles,

1641
02:01:43,965 --> 02:01:44,132
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1642
02:01:47,928 --> 02:01:50,180
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1643
02:01:51,723 --> 02:01:52,557
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1644
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:55,727
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1645
02:01:59,272 --> 02:01:59,439
the price is $12,000.

1646
02:02:04,569 --> 02:02:05,654
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1647
02:02:07,948 --> 02:02:08,615
Yes, I do, doctor.

1648
02:02:11,326 --> 02:02:11,493
You see,
under the laws of chickasaw county,

1649
02:02:14,955 --> 02:02:18,875
Broomhilda here is my property.

1650
02:02:22,003 --> 02:02:22,170
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1651
02:02:24,297 --> 02:02:24,464
And if y'all think my price...

1652
02:02:28,969 --> 02:02:29,135
...for this nigger here
is too steep...

1653
02:02:33,306 --> 02:02:33,473
- [Grunts]
- ...What I'm gonna desire to do is...

1654
02:02:34,808 --> 02:02:34,975
...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1655
02:02:38,853 --> 02:02:40,063
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1656
02:02:41,398 --> 02:02:49,398
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1657
02:02:56,371 --> 02:03:00,417
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1658
02:03:02,294 --> 02:03:02,460
- [Hildi whimpering]
- What's it gonna be?

1659
02:03:05,005 --> 02:03:05,171
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1660
02:03:08,508 --> 02:03:14,347
Yes, you may.

1661
02:03:16,641 --> 02:03:16,808
That 12.

1662
02:03:20,478 --> 02:03:20,645
- Sold!
- [Screaming]

1663
02:03:22,397 --> 02:03:25,525
To the man with the exceptional beard

1664
02:03:27,694 --> 02:03:28,570
and his unexceptional nigger.

1665
02:03:30,322 --> 02:03:31,531
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1666
02:03:33,408 --> 02:03:34,367
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1667
02:03:36,828 --> 02:03:37,704
$12,000.

1668
02:03:39,331 --> 02:03:47,331
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1669
02:04:37,305 --> 02:04:45,305
Now, gentlemen...

1670
02:04:54,155 --> 02:05:02,155
...if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1671
02:05:06,501 --> 02:05:09,003
...we will be serving white cake.

1672
02:05:11,881 --> 02:05:13,341
[Beethoven's "fur elise"
played on harp]

1673
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:21,266
- [Screaming]
- [Dogs snarling]

1674
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:22,517
[Screaming]

1675
02:05:25,145 --> 02:05:25,311
Well done, Calvin.

1676
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:26,646
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1677
02:05:27,981 --> 02:05:28,148
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1678
02:05:30,066 --> 02:05:30,233
[Stephen] Doctor!

1679
02:05:31,651 --> 02:05:39,651
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1680
02:05:58,803 --> 02:05:59,804
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1681
02:06:02,056 --> 02:06:03,099
Let it be.

1682
02:06:04,309 --> 02:06:09,063
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1683
02:06:10,064 --> 02:06:12,025
I'll handle this.

1684

1685

I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1686
02:06:22,202 --> 02:06:22,994
Hm.

1687

[Calvin chuckles softly]

1688
02:06:28,416 --> 02:06:31,503
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1689
02:06:35,548 --> 02:06:35,715
Actually, I was thinKing of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1690
02:06:37,383 --> 02:06:37,550
D'Artagnan.

1691
02:06:39,093 --> 02:06:39,260
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1692
02:06:43,681 --> 02:06:43,848
Come again?

1693
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:47,727
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote the three musketeers.

1694
02:06:49,687 --> 02:06:51,731
Yes, of course, doctor.

1695
02:06:53,566 --> 02:06:55,777
I figured you must be an admirer.

1696
02:07:00,949 --> 02:07:03,243
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1697
02:07:05,036 --> 02:07:06,913
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1698
02:07:09,123 --> 02:07:12,961
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1699
02:07:15,755 --> 02:07:15,922
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1700
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:17,757
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1701
02:07:19,133 --> 02:07:21,261
Soft-hearted frenchie.

1702
02:07:24,222 --> 02:07:24,389
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1703
02:07:26,558 --> 02:07:26,724
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1704
02:07:28,935 --> 02:07:30,186
- May I?
- Of course.

1705
02:07:33,106 --> 02:07:41,106
Thank you.

1706
02:07:55,628 --> 02:07:59,215
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1707
02:08:01,509 --> 02:08:03,761
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1708
02:08:06,139 --> 02:08:14,139
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1709
02:08:20,028 --> 02:08:21,988
- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.

1710
02:08:25,783 --> 02:08:25,950
Thank you.

1711
02:08:30,413 --> 02:08:30,580

1712

...consider yourself a free woman.

1713
02:08:37,754 --> 02:08:41,633
Mr. Candie...

1714
02:08:42,926 --> 02:08:43,885
...normally,
I would say auf wiedersehen.

1715
02:08:45,428 --> 02:08:47,138
But since what auf wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1716
02:08:49,223 --> 02:08:51,100
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1717
02:08:52,143 --> 02:08:56,856
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1718
02:08:58,983 --> 02:08:59,484
Let's go.

1719
02:09:04,864 --> 02:09:05,698
Come on.

1720
02:09:07,742 --> 02:09:07,909
One more moment, doctor!

1721
02:09:10,954 --> 02:09:11,120
What?

1722
02:09:13,414 --> 02:09:14,290
It's a custom here in the South...

1723
02:09:17,210 --> 02:09:17,377
...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1724
02:09:19,379 --> 02:09:19,545
It implies good faith.

1725
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:23,466
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1726
02:09:26,469 --> 02:09:26,636
...in my house, doctor.

1727
02:09:28,429 --> 02:09:30,098
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1728
02:09:35,311 --> 02:09:35,478
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1729
02:09:40,441 --> 02:09:40,608
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1730
02:09:43,236 --> 02:09:44,112
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1731
02:09:46,948 --> 02:09:47,907
No, I don't.

1732
02:09:51,411 --> 02:09:52,370
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1733
02:09:58,042 --> 02:09:58,209
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1734
02:09:59,961 --> 02:10:00,962

have shook hands.

...you don't shake my hand.

1737
02:10:10,596 --> 02:10:13,516
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1738
02:10:14,851 --> 02:10:22,851
I don't think so.
