1
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:26,470
(theme song plays)

2
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:16,408
(chains rattling)

3
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,220
(man grunting)

4
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:40,397
(horse nickering)

5
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:57,174
- Whoa.
- (horses snorting)

6
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:59,979
(gentle metallic rattling)

7
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,616
Whoa.

8
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,270
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

9
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:26,243
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

10
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:29,007
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

11
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:31,515
I mean you no harm.

12
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:36,486
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

13
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,486
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

14
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:42,026
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

15
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:43,857
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

16
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,828
Might that be you?

17
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,964
- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.

18
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,003
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

19
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:53,105
(snorting)

20
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:56,766
- What kinda doctor?
- (Schultz) Dentist.

21
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,741
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

22
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:01,676
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

23
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,443
- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.

24
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:07,951
- Speak English.
- (chuckles) Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,318
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

26
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,790
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

27
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,395
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

28
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:17,962
Hello, you poor devils!

29
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:21,927
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

30
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:25,333
of the Carrucan plantation?

31
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,301
(man) I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

32
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:31,308
Who said that?

33
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,113
(Schultz lighting match)

34
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:19,890
What's your name?

35
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:25,998
Django.

36
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:28,862
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.

37
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:32,967
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

38
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:37,565
Who are they?

39
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,640
Big John.

40
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:43,746
Ellis.

41
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:49,121
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

42
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,720
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

43
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:53,951
Not anymore.

44
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,054
Tell me...

45
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,463
...if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

46
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:04,331
- would you recognize them?
- (man) Hey.

47
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,939
- Stop talkin' to him like that.
- Like what?

48
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,665
Like that.

49
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:11,106
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

50
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,337
Speak English, goddamn it.

51
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,243
Everybody calm down.

52
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:19,112
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

53
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:22,278
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

54
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:25,414
(scoffs) Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

55
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,749
Move it.

56
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:32,831
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

57
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:36,766
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

58
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:39,736
Last chance, fancy pants.

59
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:43,472
Oh, very well.

60
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,202
(horse whinnying)

61
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,112
(man screaming)

62
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,914
(scream echoing)

63
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,497
(screaming continues)

64
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,740
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

65
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:16,808
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

66
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,275
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

67
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:22,848
You goddamn son of a bitch!

68
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,815
- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...

69
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,681
And you killed Ace!

70
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:30,517
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

71
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:33,524
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

72
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,652
...five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

73
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,697
- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.

74
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,427
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

75
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,902
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

76
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,064
(screaming resumes)

77
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:53,368
- (man) God-fuckin'-damn it!
- As I was saying...

78
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:57,244
...if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

79
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,646
Yeah.

80
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,117
Sold American!

81
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:05,190
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

82
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,124
That iron is nasty business.

83
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,465
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

84
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,099
Thank you. Django?

85
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:26,178
Get up on that horse.

86
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,143
Also, if I were you,

87
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:32,274
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

88
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,267
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

89
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,837
(screaming)

90
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,883
Goddamn it! Oh!
(moaning)

91
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:12,752
One hundred... ten... 20...

92
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,723
...and five...

93
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,190
...for young Django here.

94
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,491
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

95
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:22,157
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

96
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:27,829
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

97
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,601
Do you have one?

98
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:32,711
- You go to hell, dentist.
- (scoffs)

99
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,836
I thought not.

100
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:38,473
No worries. I come prepared.

101
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,449
Thank you.

102
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,185
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

103
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,657
(nickering)

104
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,495
Whoa.

105
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:09,170
Now, as to you poor devils.

106
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:14,378
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

107
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,421
you gentlemen have two choices.

108
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:22,688
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

109
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,797
then carry him to the nearest town.

110
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:28,526
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

111
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:34,368
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

112
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:37,101
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

113
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:40,770
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

114
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,042
Choice is yours.

115
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:47,585
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

116
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,712
the North Star is that one.

117
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,354
Ta-ta. (clucking)

118
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:14,237
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

119
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:17,745
- (lantern crashing)
- (chains rattling)

120
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:21,320
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

121
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,815
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

122
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,553
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

123
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,687
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

124
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,891
- I'll get you your freedom.
- (gun cocking)

125
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:36,235
- No. No, please...
- (gunshot echoing)

126
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,760
- No. No, please...
- (gunshot echoing)

127
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,351
(dogs barking nearby)

128
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,444
(squeaking)

129
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:25,550
All right, now.

130
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,710
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

131
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:30,049
- (coughing)
...and then in the morning...

132
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:33,954
That's a nigger on a horse.

133
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:01,416
What's everybody staring at?

134
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:04,045
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

135
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:07,488
(goats bleating)

136
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:17,324
Whoa.

137
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,381
Good morning, innkeeper!

138
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:33,207
Two beers for two weary travelers.

139
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:35,149
It's still a bit early.

140
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,722
We won't be open for another hour.

141
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:39,722
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

142
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:45,297
(gasping) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

143
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,523
Get that nigger outta here!

144
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:55,130
- (panting) Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

145
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:58,471
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

146
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,511
(man) Sheriff! Help!

147
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,238
Alas.

148
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,174
Now we must act as our own bartender.

149
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,351
Sit down, my boy.

150
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:22,899
- What kind of dentist are you?
- (chortles)

151
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:28,332
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

152
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:36,244
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

153
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:39,849
...bounty hunter.

154
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,256
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

155
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,053
No.

156
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:51,390
Well...

157
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:57,162
...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

158
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:59,635
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

159
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:02,035
(tsking) Hat.

160
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:07,336
Prost.

161
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:18,184
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

162
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:21,054
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

163
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:25,152
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

164
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:28,062
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

165
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,998
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

166
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,900
I truly have killed him,

167
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,031
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

168
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,508
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

169
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,136
What's a bounty?

170
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:47,441
It's like a reward.

171
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:50,987
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

172
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:53,023
Certain people, yeah.

173
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,319
Bad people?

174
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,453
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

175
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,895
Which brings me to you.

176
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:05,333
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

177
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,939
On one hand, I despise slavery.

178
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:11,202
On the other hand, I need your help.

179
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,711
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

180
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,310
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

181
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,681
work to my benefit.

182
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,484
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

183
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:32,426
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

184
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,303
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

185
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:47,343
However, at this endeavor,

186
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,611
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

187
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:56,754
But you do. Don't ya?

188
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,119
I know what they look like all right.

189
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:02,785
Good. So here's my agreement.

190
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:06,386
- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we goin'?

191
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:09,194
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

192
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,530
but I don't know where.

193
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,004
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

194
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:21,375
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

195
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:25,851
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

196
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,587
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $ 75.

197
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,111
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $ 75.

198
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:33,987
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

199
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,059
(scoffs)

200
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:47,229
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

201
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:54,436
- (overlapping chatter)
- All right, folks, calm down.

202
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,210
Go about your business.

203
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,383
These jokers will be gone soon.

204
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:07,792
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

205
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:11,158
And scare all these nice people.

206
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:15,026
You ain't got nothing better to do

207
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,432
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

208
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,835
and show your ass?

209
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:22,770
- (metal springing noise)
- (sheriff screaming)

210
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:25,877
- (crowd gasping)
- (groaning)

211
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,410
(woman screams)

212
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:33,084
- What'd you just do to our sheriff?
- (groaning)

213
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:36,453
- (yelling)
- (shot echoing)

214
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:37,817
(woman gasps)

215
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,925
(crowd screaming)

216
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,694
Now you can get the marshal.

217
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,600
(man) Marshal! Marshal!

218
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:53,000
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

219
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:54,332
After you.

220
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:01,041
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

221
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,115
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

222
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,411
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

223
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,952
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

224
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:12,057
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

225
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,183
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

226
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:18,557
You in the saloon!

227
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:22,030
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

228
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:25,931
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

229
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,263
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

230
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:31,376
and I mean right now.

231
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:35,969
(Schultz) Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

232
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,912
Yes, it is.

233
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,177
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

234
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,583
(Schultz)
Na wunderbar, marshal.

235
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,717
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

236
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,794
and just as you have instructed,

237
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,659
I am ready to step outside

238
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,859
with my hands raised above my head.

239
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:00,405
I trust as a representative

240
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,940
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

241
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:09,946
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

242
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:12,949
before I've had my day in court.

243
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,451
You mean like you did our sheriff.

244
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,419
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

245
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:19,922
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

246
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:25,725
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

247
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:32,367
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

248
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:35,496
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

249
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,511
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

250
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,508
They're a little tense out there.

251
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:47,107
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

252
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:50,115
- (doors squeaking open)
- Come ahead.

253
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:58,459
You unarmed?

254
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,292
(Schultz) Yes, indeed we are.

255
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:04,433
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

256
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,538
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

257
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:09,038
as to the incident that just occurred?

258
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,844
- Go on.
- Thank you.

259
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:15,139
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

260
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,579
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

261
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:22,153
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

262
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:26,383
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

263
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:31,155
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

264
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:33,924
with a price on his head of $200.

265
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:37,035
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

266
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,534
The hell, you say!

267
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:42,767
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

268
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:46,105
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

269
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,736
sometime in the past two years?

270
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:50,672
Yeah.

271
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:54,274
(Schultz) I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

272
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,878
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

273
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:01,857
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

274
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:07,694
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

275
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,562
You're encouraged to wire him.

276
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:14,765
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

277
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:18,866
(guns uncocking)

278
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:26,874
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

279
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:29,954
(medium-tempo song plays)

280
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,017
I'll be damned.

281
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,685
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

282
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:14,356
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$ 75 in your back pocket...

283
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,568
What's your plan after that?

284
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,673
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

285
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:31,781
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

286
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:34,616
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

287
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:38,348
Oh, me and my wife do.

288
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,654
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

289
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,523
(man) Django.

290
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:48,792
Django, Django.

291
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:51,630
You got sand, Django.

292
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:54,236
Boy's got sand.

293
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:59,135
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

294
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:04,406
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

295
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,608
And the girl, too.

296
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:07,582
(groaning)

297
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:12,486
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

298
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:15,259
Both of 'em.

299
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:17,123
Separately.

300
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:20,929
And this one...

301
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:26,265
...you will sell him cheap.

302
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,730
In Greenville...

303
00:25:32,277 --> 00:25:35,246
...there should be some sort
of a records office.

304
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:44,649
You know when she was sold...

305
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:49,093
...you know where she came from,

306
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,093
and you know her name.

307
00:25:51,864 --> 00:25:53,456
What is her name?

308
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,260
Broomhilda.

309
00:25:56,835 --> 00:26:00,134
- What?
- Broom-hilda.

310
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:02,206
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-mm.

311
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,301
- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?

312
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,613
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

313
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:12,342
She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.

314
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:14,611
She speak a little German, too.

315
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:16,550
- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.

316
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,553
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

317
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,282
to speak German with.

318
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,454
Well, let me get this straight.

319
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:29,226
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

320
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:30,494
Yep.

321
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:37,269
They call me Hildi.

322
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,784
(rooster crowing nearby)

323
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:57,062
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

324
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:59,553
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

325
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,629
You'll be playing a character.

326
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:11,634
Hm?

327
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:13,776
No?

328
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:25,246
During the act, you can
never break character.

329
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:27,883
Do you understand?

330
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:31,152
Yeah. Don't break character.

331
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:37,434
And your character
is that of The Valet.

332
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,660
What that is?

333
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:43,005
That's a fancy word for servant.

334
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:44,438
- Valet?
- Hm-mm.

335
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:45,110
(chuckles)

336
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,769
(chuckles)

337
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:50,405
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

338
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,683
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

339
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,809
But of course.

340
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:59,617
(medium-tempo song
resumes playing)

341
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:25,777
Whoa.

342
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:33,683
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

343
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:37,226
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

344
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:41,298
- I said niggers on horses...
- (Schultz) His name is Django.

345
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:44,231
He's a free man.
He can ride what he pleases.

346
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,827
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.

347
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:53,535
My good sir,
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

348
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:56,169
Allow me to unring this bell.

349
00:28:56,314 --> 00:29:00,182
My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.

350
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,445
And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.

351
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,452
- (snorting)
- (women giggling)

352
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:07,691
Mr. Bennett?

353
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:12,058
I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.

354
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:16,190
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

355
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:18,234
to parley with you now.

356
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:23,371
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

357
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,038
You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee

358
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,011
to buy one of my nigger gals?

359
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:31,843
No appointment, no nothin'?

360
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:33,917
Oh, I'm afraid so.

361
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:36,486
Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?

362
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,350
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

363
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,720
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

364
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,793
Now what you got to say about that?

365
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:48,098
Mr. Bennett.

366
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:51,532
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

367
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,801
I have 5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

368
00:29:58,243 --> 00:29:59,267
(chuckles softly)

369
00:30:01,046 --> 00:30:04,504
Well, come on inside and get
yourself somethin' cool to drink.

370
00:30:06,485 --> 00:30:07,577
Hm-mm.

371
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:12,348
(chuckles)

372
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:20,988
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

373
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,727
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

374
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:26,269
to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

375
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:28,599
Oh, well, absolutely!
Uh, Betina.

376
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,503
- Yessir, Big Daddy?
- Uh...

377
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:32,576
What's your Jimmie's name again?

378
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,235
- Django.
- Django.

379
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:36,540
Betina, sugar, could you
take Django there

380
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:39,946
and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

381
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,382
As you please, Big Daddy.

382
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,479
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

383
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:48,991
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

384
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:51,652
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

385
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:54,822
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
- Yes'm?

386
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:59,596
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

387
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:03,134
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

388
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:06,210
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

389
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:09,279
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

390
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:12,542
No. That's not what I said.

391
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,209
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

392
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,282
Yes, I can see that. Uh...

393
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:24,885
What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?

394
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,021
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

395
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,963
- Oh, you mean Jerry.
- That's the boy's name. Jerry!

396
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:31,625
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?

397
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,898
- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.

398
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,009
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

399
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,509
(playing medium-tempo tune)

400
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,712
That house we just left from
is The Big House.

401
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:50,787
Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.

402
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:54,153
That there is the pantry.

403
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:57,819
That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.

404
00:31:57,963 --> 00:31:59,988
Po' little squirrels.

405
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,168
What you do for your massa?

406
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:06,065
Didn't you hear him tell you
I ain't no slave?

407
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,638
- So you really free?
- Yes, I's free.

408
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,139
You mean you wanna dress like that?

409
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:15,446
- Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.
- What you want?

410
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,708
I'm lookin' for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.

411
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,340
Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?

412
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:22,385
- Brittle?
- Yes, Brittle.

413
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,854
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.

414
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:28,789
I don't know them.

415
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:31,259
They could be usin' a different name.

416
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,660
They woulda come to the plantation
this past year.

417
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:35,066
- You mean the Shaffers?
- Maybe.

418
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,465
- You mean the Shaffers?
- Maybe.

419
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:38,762
- Three brothers?
- Uh-huh.

420
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:40,700
- They here?
- Uh-huh.

421
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,602
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

422
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,039
Well, one's over in that field.

423
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:53,815
(medium-tempo song plays)

424
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:00,751
(Django) Old Man Carrucan ain't
gonna appreciate this, now.

425
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:01,881
She work in the house, John.

426
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:03,927
You could mess her skin up,
and you gonna mess her up

427
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:06,053
and she ain't gonna be worth...
she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.

428
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,062
Now, your Bible say...

429
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:14,832
(Django) Look, I told you
that I was one that made her do it.

430
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,634
You ready?

431
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:19,107
She didn't wanna run off with me. If
anybody should be gettin' whupped now,

432
00:33:19,244 --> 00:33:20,643
it should be me. It should be me, John.

433
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,771
Now, I been here long enough, you know
me, you know me a long time, now.

434
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:26,475
(dogs barking in distance)

435
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,482
You know Massa Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this.

436
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:37,288
She's a... she's a house slave.

437
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:40,830
- She a house slave, she can't be...
- (screaming)

438
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:46,836
(dogs howling)

439
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:55,743
(screaming)

440
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:02,718
On my knees. I'm asking you this,
please. Ain't this what you want?

441
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:04,788
I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.

442
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:07,687
(gasping, sobbing)

443
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:11,855
I's on my knees, John.

444
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:13,987
I like the way you beg, boy.

445
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:16,623
(whip cracking, echoing)

446
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:20,268
Is that who you was lookin' for?

447
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:23,233
Yep.

448
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:25,873
Where the other two at?

449
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,810
They by the stable,
punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

450
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,609
They whippin' Little Jody?

451
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,082
Point me in that direction.

452
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,816
You go to that tree
and keep goin' that-a way.

453
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:44,520
Go get that white man
I came here with.

454
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:47,461
- (man) Come on, now.
- No, no, please!

455
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,123
- Come on, girlie.
- (shrieks) Please!

456
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,861
- Come on. Get you set up now.
- (screaming)

457
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:54,471
"And the Lord said,
'The fear of ye..."

458
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,598
- (cracking)
- "...and the dread of ye

459
00:34:57,742 --> 00:35:00,074
shall be on every beast
of the earth."'

460
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:01,200
(cracking)

461
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:02,745
Come here now, woman!

462
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:05,975
- You'd better give me that arm!
- (screaming)

463
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:24,897
OK, she's ready!

464
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:29,269
(whimpering)

465
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:42,976
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

466
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:48,358
John Brittle!

467
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:11,575
- You remember me?
- (metal springing noise)

468
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:24,860
I like the way you die, boy.

469
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:33,160
Goddamn son of a bitch!

470
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:44,010
(grunting)

471
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:46,048
(whip cracking)

472
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:47,842
(groaning)

473
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:52,689
- Keep it funny!
- (grunting)

474
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:58,289
(yelling)

475
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:08,896
(man groaning)

476
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:19,716
Y'all wanna see somethin'?

477
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:21,985
(cocking pistol)

478
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:24,882
No! (groans)

479
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:30,827
(clicking)

480
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,557
Who were they?

481
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:40,328
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

482
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:41,961
Where's Ellis?

483
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:44,472
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

484
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,838
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

485
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:52,916
- Positive?
- I don't know.

486
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:55,315
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what "positive" mean.

487
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:56,750
- It means you're sure.
- Yes.

488
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:59,186
- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

489
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:13,961
I'm positive he dead.

490
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:20,032
Django!

491
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:24,281
Everybody calm down.

492
00:38:24,415 --> 00:38:26,713
We mean no one else any harm.

493
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,409
Who are you two jokers?

494
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:31,579
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

495
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:34,419
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

496
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,155
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

497
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:41,288
In my pocket is a warrant,

498
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:45,528
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

499
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,606
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

500
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:54,769
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

501
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:56,971
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

502
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:02,580
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

503
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,381
These are wanted men.

504
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,012
The law wants 'em for murder.

505
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:10,321
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

506
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:13,794
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

507
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:17,367
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

508
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:22,906
I realize passions are high,

509
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:27,137
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force

510
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:29,678
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

511
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:33,716
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

512
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:41,490
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

513
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:44,687
Gimme.

514
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:02,610
Satisfied?

515
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,384
May I have that back, please?

516
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:20,121
- Get off my land.
- Posthaste.

517
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:25,202
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.

518
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:30,740
(Schultz whistling indistinctly)

519
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:54,554
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

520
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,909
(galloping hoofbeats)

521
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:05,807
(galloping hoofbeats)

522
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:11,944
- (dramatic choral music)
- (horses snorting, whinnying)

523
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,817
(men yelling, whooping)

524
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:35,867
Come on, men!

525
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:41,567
- (man 1) We're coming for you, nigger!
- (man 2) Hee-haw!

526
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:55,248
Now, unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

527
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:57,588
That's way too simple for these jokers.

528
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,991
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

529
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:06,160
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

530
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:11,268
Damn.

531
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,204
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

532
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:17,478
We ready or what?

533
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:20,015
(Big Daddy) Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

534
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:22,551
- (fabric ripping)
- Oh... Oh, shit.

535
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:24,917
I just made it worse.

536
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:27,149
Who made this goddamn shit?

537
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,283
- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

538
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:34,023
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

539
00:42:34,165 --> 00:42:36,759
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

540
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:38,630
I coulda cut it better than this!

541
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:41,567
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

542
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:42,968
Not too good.

543
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:47,476
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

544
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:51,139
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

545
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:53,341
- Shit.
- (man) Yeah.

546
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:55,546
I just made mine worse.

547
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:57,547
Oh, God.

548
00:42:57,688 --> 00:42:59,246
Anybody bring any extra bags?

549
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,382
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

550
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:04,187
I'm just askin'.

551
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:06,159
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

552
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:07,525
Oh, well, shitfire!

553
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:10,759
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

554
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:12,893
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

555
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:15,767
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

556
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:18,375
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

557
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:22,309
Now, I watched my wife work all day
gettin' 30 bags together

558
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:24,505
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

559
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:28,415
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

560
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:31,715
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

561
00:43:33,024 --> 00:43:35,925
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

562
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,188
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

563
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,661
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

564
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:44,700
OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

565
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:49,636
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

566
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:50,763
- Yeah.
- (mumbling agreements)

567
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:54,969
But, not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

568
00:43:55,947 --> 00:43:59,678
So how 'bout no bags this time,

569
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:04,845
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

570
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:07,014
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

571
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:10,559
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

572
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:12,720
But nobody can see.

573
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:13,955
So?

574
00:44:14,098 --> 00:44:15,998
So it'd be nice to see.

575
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:20,934
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

576
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:26,442
So what? All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

577
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,408
- (overlapping shouts)
- (man) Sons of bitches!

578
00:44:30,214 --> 00:44:31,909
I can't see shit!

579
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:35,712
(Big Daddy) There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!

580
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,579
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

581
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:40,350
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

582
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:41,958
- What?
- They tricked us!

583
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:43,151
Well, where are they?

584
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:44,727
Auf Wiedersehen.

585
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:48,461
- (all shouting)
- (horses whinnying)

586
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:52,265
Oh! (chuckles)

587
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:53,461
Bull's-eye.

588
00:44:53,604 --> 00:44:56,300
- (men yelling)
- (horses whinnying)

589
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,705
- (Django) Look at 'em run.
- (all shouting)

590
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:04,974
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

591
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:07,050
Goddamn it!

592
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,452
(Big Daddy) Goddamn it!

593
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:20,792
Would you care to?

594
00:45:27,605 --> 00:45:29,402
Can't see shit outta this!

595
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:32,202
- He's getting away.
- I got him.

596
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:35,735
(Schultz)
Big Daddy's getting away.

597
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,142
I got him.

598
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:44,076
- (slow-motion impact sound)
- (Big Daddy grunting)

599
00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:53,420
Got him.

600
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:01,294
(chuckles) The kid's a natural.

601
00:46:06,043 --> 00:46:07,601
(animal yipping nearby)

602
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:15,782
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

603
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,218
Broomhilda is a German name.

604
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:21,085
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

605
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:23,489
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

606
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:27,253
Broomhilda is the name of a character

607
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:31,357
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

608
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:33,470
There's a story about Broomhilda?

609
00:46:33,604 --> 00:46:35,333
Oh, yes, there is.

610
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:44,836
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.

611
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:52,620
Would you like me to tell you?

612
00:46:54,125 --> 00:47:00,121
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

613
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:06,062
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

614
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:10,335
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

615
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:11,736
What she do?

616
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,166
I can't exactly remember.

617
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:17,007
She disobeys him in some way.

618
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:20,311
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

619
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:22,145
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

620
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:23,583
It's a German legend,

621
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:26,519
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

622
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:30,684
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

623
00:47:32,363 --> 00:47:37,460
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

624
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:43,270
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

625
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:49,842
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

626
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:52,540
Does a fella arise?

627
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:55,675
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

628
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,844
A fella named Siegfried.

629
00:47:58,589 --> 00:47:59,578
Does Siegfried save her?

630
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:04,353
Quite spectacularly so.

631
00:48:05,429 --> 00:48:09,525
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

632
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:14,465
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

633
00:48:14,638 --> 00:48:17,106
And he walks through hellfire...

634
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,809
...because Broomhilda's worth it.

635
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,577
I know how he feel.

636
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:31,920
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

637
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:41,592
Now, look, Django...

638
00:48:44,535 --> 00:48:48,562
...I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

639
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:53,302
...but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.

640
00:48:54,345 --> 00:48:58,805
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.

641
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:01,850
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

642
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:06,949
But let me ask you a question.

643
00:49:14,465 --> 00:49:16,899
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

644
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:20,734
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

645
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:22,937
What's not to like?

646
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:25,507
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

647
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:28,510
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

648
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:30,773
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

649
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:32,882
but normally, that's a good thing.

650
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:35,914
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

651
00:49:36,053 --> 00:49:38,078
What you mean "partner up"?

652
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:42,522
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

653
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:45,485
...I give you a third of my bounties.

654
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,666
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

655
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,770
I'll take you to Greenville myself

656
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:57,101
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

657
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:03,108
Why you care what happen to me?

658
00:50:04,848 --> 00:50:06,839
Why you care if I find my wife?

659
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:08,383
Frankly...

660
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:12,588
...l've never given anybody
their freedom before.

661
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:16,557
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

662
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:21,492
Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

663
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:26,969
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

664
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:29,698
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

665
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,643
(medium-tempo song plays)

666
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:40,026
(man) You got her.

667
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:51,770
Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money"?

668
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,645
- His son's with him.
- Well, good.

669
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:56,412
He'll have a loved one with him.

670
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:59,044
Maybe even share a last word.

671
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:03,117
That's better than most of them get.

672
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,524
Damn sight better than he deserves.

673
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:15,068
Put down the rifle.

674
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:19,770
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

675
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:22,876
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

676
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,340
Read it aloud.

677
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:31,016
Consider that today's lesson.

678
00:53:33,457 --> 00:53:36,119
"Wanted. Dead or alive.

679
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:41,030
Smitty Bacall and the
Smitty Bacall G..."

680
00:53:41,164 --> 00:53:43,428
- (Schultz) Gang.
- "Gang."

681
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:47,264
"For murder and stagecoach...

682
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:50,230
...robbery.

683
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:53,207
- Seven-zero-zero-zero..."
- Seven thousand.

684
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:54,708
Thousand.

685
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:59,077
"$ 7,000 for Smitty Bacall.

686
00:53:59,216 --> 00:54:04,347
$1,500 for each of his...

687
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:06,285
...gang..."

688
00:54:07,324 --> 00:54:09,315
- Mem...
- "Members.

689
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:14,691
Known members of the Smitty Bacall
Gang are as follas:"

690
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:16,594
- Follows.
- "Follows."

691
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:20,430
"Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."

692
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:23,506
Crazy Craig Koons.

693
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:26,772
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

694
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,811
If Smitty Bacall wanted
to start a farm at 22,

695
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:31,915
they would never have printed that.

696
00:54:32,616 --> 00:54:36,074
But Smitty Bacall
wanted to rob stagecoaches

697
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:38,653
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

698
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:42,622
Do you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?

699
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:45,384
This is what I do.

700
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:49,056
I kill people and
sell their corpses for cash.

701
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,800
This corpse is worth $ 7,000.

702
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:56,167
Now quit your pussyfooting
and shoot him.

703
00:55:00,944 --> 00:55:02,935
(horse whinnying)

704
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:05,479
(boy giggles)

705
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:07,716
Pa?

706
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:09,148
Pa!

707
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:19,357
Here.

708
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:21,623
You need to keep this
Smitty Bacall handbill.

709
00:55:21,765 --> 00:55:23,892
- Why?
- It's good luck.

710
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:26,798
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

711
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,310
(up-tempo guitar music plays)

712
00:56:14,718 --> 00:56:16,151
That's accurate.

713
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:32,699
- (horses whinny)
- (overlapping gunshots)

714
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:44,812
(shell casings clinking)

715
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:53,790
(bellowing)

716
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:27,582
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

717
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:30,855
Who the hell-a you got there?

718
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:32,962
(Schultz) The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

719
00:57:33,096 --> 00:57:36,088
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

720
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,396
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner
Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.

721
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:45,200
Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,
they ain't going nowhere.

722
00:57:45,342 --> 00:57:47,742
Why don't you come in then
out of the snowy snow

723
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:49,743
and get yourselves some coffee.

724
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,440
We had a birthday yesterday.
Got some cake.

725
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:54,015
Pretty good.

726
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,998
(chains rattling)

727
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:18,471
(man 1) Move along!

728
00:58:23,814 --> 00:58:25,907
Move it, boy!

729
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,747
(man 2) Keep movin'.

730
00:58:28,885 --> 00:58:30,819
Get on up on that auction block.

731
00:58:32,355 --> 00:58:34,755
Don't let that mud slow you down.
Keep going.

732
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:52,436
Keep goin'!

733
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:58,847
(Schultz)
"Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27.

734
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:00,381
'R' on right cheek."

735
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:04,349
Calvin Candie.

736
00:59:04,487 --> 00:59:08,947
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.

737
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:10,456
Candyland?

738
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:11,686
Oh, so you've heard of it.

739
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:13,955
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

740
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:16,759
Well, apparently,
that's where your wife is...

741
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,629
- (sighs)
...and that's the repellant gentleman

742
00:59:18,768 --> 00:59:22,329
who owns her. Let's just hope she
works in the house, not in the field.

743
00:59:22,472 --> 00:59:24,633
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

744
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:26,742
She... she pretty.

745
00:59:27,444 --> 00:59:29,344
And she talk good, too.

746
00:59:30,947 --> 00:59:32,710
But when they tore her back up
and then they...

747
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:36,078
...burned that runaway "r"
on her cheek...

748
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,680
...they goddamned her.

749
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:40,482
(yells)

750
00:59:40,624 --> 00:59:42,148
- (sizzling)
- (screaming)

751
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:44,826
She ain't no field nigger
but she ain't good enough

752
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:46,952
for the house no more either.

753
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:48,428
They gonna try to
make her a comfort girl.

754
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:50,430
What's a comfort...? Oh.

755
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:52,665
Not while I got freedom.

756
00:59:54,237 --> 00:59:56,034
Not while I got my gun.

757
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:00,837
So do we offer to buy her?

758
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,845
So...

759
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,077
...say...

760
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:13,518
...a man wants to buy a horse.

761
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:15,682
Needs to buy a horse.

762
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,629
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
and he knocks on the farmer's door

763
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:21,458
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.

764
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:23,429
And do you know what the farmer says?

765
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:25,761
The farmer says no.

766
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:32,264
Well, I say fuck that farmer,
and I'm stealin' that horse.

767
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:36,573
Fair enough. But now you're a horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.

768
01:00:36,713 --> 01:00:38,874
Not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner

769
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:40,642
because the horse is still his property.

770
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:44,686
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

771
01:00:44,821 --> 01:00:47,119
Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,
then how we gonna get her?

772
01:00:48,224 --> 01:00:51,819
May I offer an alternative
plan of action?

773
01:00:51,962 --> 01:00:53,486
Go ahead.

774
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:58,226
So... the man walks up
to the farmer's farm,

775
01:00:58,368 --> 01:00:59,892
he knocks on the farmer's door...

776
01:01:00,603 --> 01:01:05,666
...and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm.

777
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:09,245
And makes an offer so ridiculous,

778
01:01:09,379 --> 01:01:12,143
the farmer is forced to say yes.

779
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:15,814
- We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
- No, it's far too big.

780
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:19,183
But apparently this farmer
ain't all about the farm.

781
01:01:20,657 --> 01:01:22,750
How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?

782
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:23,881
What?

783
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:26,894
Can you convincingly
masquerade as someone

784
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,759
who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

785
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:29,956
Why?

786
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,763
(Schultz) Because my character is that
of a big money buyer from Dsseldorf,

787
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:37,339
here in Greenville to buy my way
into the Mandingo fight game.

788
01:01:37,474 --> 01:01:41,410
And your character is a Mandingo expert
I hired to help me do it.

789
01:01:41,544 --> 01:01:43,512
(Django)
They call that "One-Eyed Charley."

790
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:48,049
Bonjour.

791
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:51,014
(speaks French)

792
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:54,123
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

793
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:55,815
Entraz.

794
01:01:58,328 --> 01:01:59,795
- Thank you.
- Hm-mm.

795
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,492
You want me to play a black slaver?

796
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:06,329
Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.

797
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:09,927
A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger...

798
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:12,700
...and, buddy,
that's pretty fuckin' low.

799
01:02:13,843 --> 01:02:15,868
Then play him that way.

800
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:20,216
Give me your black slaver.

801
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,579
(people singing
medium-tempo song)

802
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,713
* Along came the 219
Toot! Toot! Peanut butter!

803
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:30,189
(singing continues indistinctly)

804
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:33,361
Dr. Schultz!

805
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:36,727
- Good to see you again!
- Mr. Moguy.

806
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:39,699
Thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity

807
01:02:39,836 --> 01:02:42,669
- for this appointment.
- Nonsense, it's my job.

808
01:02:42,806 --> 01:02:45,639
So this is the One-Eyed Charley
I've heard so much about.

809
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:48,243
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

810
01:02:48,378 --> 01:02:51,074
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

811
01:02:51,214 --> 01:02:53,205
Just call me Leo.

812
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:56,546
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

813
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,984
(Schultz) How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

814
01:02:59,122 --> 01:03:01,613
(Leo) Oh, Calvin's father and I
were about 11

815
01:03:01,758 --> 01:03:03,589
when we went to
boarding school together.

816
01:03:03,726 --> 01:03:06,820
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

817
01:03:06,963 --> 01:03:10,023
One could almost say
I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

818
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:11,895
One could almost say youse a nigger.

819
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:14,236
What did you say?

820
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:17,100
- I said...
- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

821
01:03:17,674 --> 01:03:22,111
Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

822
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:24,270
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

823
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:26,245
(chuckles)
What civilized people aren't?

824
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:28,646
And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.

825
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:31,276
(speaks French)

826
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:35,414
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

827
01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:38,217
(men fighting, grunting)

828
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:40,625
(man) Get back on top, now!
Turn around!

829
01:03:40,763 --> 01:03:42,287
There you go.

830
01:03:42,432 --> 01:03:44,059
There you go.

831
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:48,199
Why do you want to get in
the Mandingo business?

832
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,771
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

833
01:03:55,512 --> 01:03:57,446
Quit stalling, now.

834
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,911
Answer the question.

835
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:05,020
The awful truth? I'm bored.

836
01:04:05,155 --> 01:04:07,521
This seems like a good bit of fun.

837
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:14,487
Well, come on over.

838
01:04:14,631 --> 01:04:17,327
We got us a fight goin' on
that's a good bit of fun.

839
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:21,231
(man speaks foreign language)

840
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:22,861
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

841
01:04:23,006 --> 01:04:25,133
(grunting, punches continue)

842
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:34,106
You don't wear a hat in the house,
white man. Even I know that.

843
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,127
- Dr. Schultz.
- What a rare pleasure.

844
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:46,694
Keep fighting, niggers.

845
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:49,662
- And I might add, an honor.
- Honor to meet you.

846
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,733
Please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.

847
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:55,395
Get free man Django here
whatever he wants.

848
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:57,836
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

849
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:10,978
(grunting from fighters continues)

850
01:05:14,424 --> 01:05:17,359
- (man yelling)
- (grunting)

851
01:05:17,493 --> 01:05:20,553
(Calvin) Use your weight, boy,
use your weight! There you go.

852
01:05:20,697 --> 01:05:22,995
He's much bigger and stronger!

853
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:24,724
Come on, now!

854
01:05:24,867 --> 01:05:27,392
He's not doing what I told him,
for God's sakes.

855
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:29,471
(speaking foreign language)

856
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:34,272
Come on, now, boy!
It's a fight to the death!

857
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:37,538
- (grunting)
- You either hit him or are you ain't?

858
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,977
(yelling)

859
01:05:42,051 --> 01:05:44,315
(speaking foreign language)

860
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:48,615
- Big Fred, come on!
- (grunting)

861
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:50,282
(Calvin) Turn him around! Now...

862
01:05:54,097 --> 01:05:58,466
(Calvin) Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!

863
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:00,398
(man screaming)

864
01:06:00,536 --> 01:06:02,333
(Calvin) There you go!

865
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,108
There you go! Look at that.

866
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,179
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

867
01:06:10,313 --> 01:06:12,406
Do what I told you, boy!

868
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:14,038
- There you go!
- (bones cracking)

869
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:16,481
- No!
- (Calvin) Do what I told ya!

870
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:19,679
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

871
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:21,949
(man screaming)

872
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:24,582
- Oh, no, Luigi.
- (screaming)

873
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:31,733
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- (screaming)

874
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:33,562
Oh...

875
01:06:33,703 --> 01:06:36,501
- (panting)
- (man continues screaming)

876
01:06:40,643 --> 01:06:41,632
(playing pool)

877
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:43,939
(screaming continues)

878
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,342
Finish him.

879
01:06:49,652 --> 01:06:51,415
Go on, boy, finish him!

880
01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:54,350
(screaming halts)

881
01:06:55,925 --> 01:06:57,654
(Moguy) That's why they
call him Big Fred.

882
01:06:57,794 --> 01:07:01,230
- Worth every penny.
- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

883
01:07:01,364 --> 01:07:03,628
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

884
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:06,758
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

885
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:09,099
Mercedes.

886
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:31,421
Tequila.

887
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:42,904
What's your name?

888
01:07:45,074 --> 01:07:46,564
Django.

889
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:50,672
Can you spell it?

890
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:56,842
D-J-A-N-G-O.

891
01:07:58,354 --> 01:07:59,878
The D is silent.

892
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:01,614
I know.

893
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:09,423
(speaks foreign language)

894
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:13,092
(Calvin) Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

895
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:14,965
You find him a room
with a soft bed,

896
01:08:15,104 --> 01:08:17,732
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

897
01:08:17,874 --> 01:08:20,638
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

898
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:21,801
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

899
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:25,846
Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

900
01:08:29,685 --> 01:08:32,711
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

901
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:34,117
Yessir.

902
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:47,467
- What's your name, boy?
- His name is Django Freeman.

903
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:48,797
(Calvin chuckles)

904
01:08:51,007 --> 01:08:52,634
Where'd you dig him up?

905
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:56,040
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

906
01:08:57,747 --> 01:08:59,806
I've heard tell about you.

907
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:03,381
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

908
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:05,646
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

909
01:09:05,788 --> 01:09:09,986
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

910
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:14,395
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

911
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,759
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.

912
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:22,134
No offense given...

913
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:24,234
...none taken.

914
01:09:24,373 --> 01:09:26,102
(Schultz) Monsieur Candie...

915
01:09:26,242 --> 01:09:29,769
...l'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

916
01:09:29,912 --> 01:09:31,345
One...

917
01:09:31,981 --> 01:09:35,144
...you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

918
01:09:35,284 --> 01:09:38,151
- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.

919
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:40,152
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

920
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:42,154
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

921
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,418
Do not spare the rum.

922
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,087
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

923
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:49,960
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

924
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:55,230
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

925
01:09:56,672 --> 01:09:59,869
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

926
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:02,510
...I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

927
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:04,806
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

928
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:07,507
at above top-dollar market price.

929
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,210
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

930
01:10:10,353 --> 01:10:12,719
it would be to discuss business.

931
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,949
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

932
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,426
We were discussin' my curiosity.

933
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:23,722
Thank you.

934
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:26,596
(Calvin) Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

935
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:32,062
Sheba... you stay right there.

936
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,732
I know you didn't mean me.

937
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:38,002
- Prost!
- German.

938
01:10:38,948 --> 01:10:42,748
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

939
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:44,978
I'm doing business with both y'all.

940
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:47,555
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

941
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:51,490
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

942
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:52,787
Hm.

943
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:55,087
So...

944
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,199
...Bright Boy...

945
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,324
...Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

946
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:01,663
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

947
01:11:01,804 --> 01:11:03,294
Not for top dollar.

948
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,534
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

949
01:11:07,677 --> 01:11:09,804
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

950
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:12,244
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

951
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:14,349
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

952
01:11:15,284 --> 01:11:18,481
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

953
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:22,921
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

954
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:28,891
Well, you won't sell your best.

955
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:31,465
You won't even sell your second best.

956
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:35,298
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

957
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:39,374
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

958
01:11:40,176 --> 01:11:42,201
(chortles)
...who knows what could happen?

959
01:11:44,547 --> 01:11:46,811
And what do you consider ridiculous?

960
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:51,913
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

961
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:55,714
How much would you say, Django?

962
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:00,790
Twelve thousand dollars.

963
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,157
(straw slurping)

964
01:12:05,368 --> 01:12:09,361
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

965
01:12:09,505 --> 01:12:11,439
but now you have my attention.

966
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:30,821
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

967
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,428
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

968
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:37,498
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.

969
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:40,534
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

970
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:42,228
(Schultz)
Oh, thank you very much.

971
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:44,498
You can tie your horse up back there.

972
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:54,012
(Calvin) Django.

973
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:02,484
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

974
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:07,824
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

975
01:13:07,963 --> 01:13:12,093
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

976
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:16,933
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

977
01:13:17,073 --> 01:13:18,563
The exceptional nigger.

978
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:21,634
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

979
01:13:22,745 --> 01:13:23,939
Sun is up.

980
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:26,981
Shining on all of us.

981
01:13:31,721 --> 01:13:34,690
- (Calvin) Have a seat, doc.
- (Schultz) Thank you.

982
01:13:34,824 --> 01:13:36,121
Quite an honor.

983
01:13:36,258 --> 01:13:38,021
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

984
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,561
(Calvin) But I do believe that,
given time,

985
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:44,666
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

986
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:47,465
...become if not frequent...

987
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:50,331
...more frequent.

988
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:56,704
Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

989
01:13:56,846 --> 01:13:59,713
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

990
01:14:00,316 --> 01:14:02,375
(men laughing)

991
01:14:12,595 --> 01:14:13,963
- Whoa!
- (whinnying)

992
01:14:15,498 --> 01:14:18,934
- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

993
01:14:19,068 --> 01:14:21,036
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

994
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,228
Are you kidding me?

995
01:14:22,371 --> 01:14:24,396
- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

996
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:27,065
Now take your hand off your pistol!

997
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:30,941
Butch, that means you too.

998
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:35,173
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

999
01:14:36,652 --> 01:14:38,882
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

1000
01:14:39,622 --> 01:14:41,214
He broke my collarbone!

1001
01:14:41,357 --> 01:14:45,657
For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

1002
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:48,855
- (man) Yessir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

1003
01:14:50,232 --> 01:14:51,631
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

1004
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:54,258
Oh, I'm gonna go
walking in the moonlight with you.

1005
01:14:54,436 --> 01:14:56,199
You wanna hold my hand?

1006
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:58,667
(chuckling)

1007
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:00,833
(rap song playing)

1008
01:15:00,976 --> 01:15:02,637
(clucking)

1009
01:15:02,778 --> 01:15:05,440
Willie, take us home.

1010
01:15:07,683 --> 01:15:09,708
(man) Start moving!

1011
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:17,319
Head 'em out!

1012
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:04,530
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

1013
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:05,970
No, sir.

1014
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:07,575
You want a boot heel in it?

1015
01:16:08,811 --> 01:16:09,800
No, sir.

1016
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:13,005
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

1017
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:16,311
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

1018
01:16:16,452 --> 01:16:17,976
Now move, nigger!

1019
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,953
(horse snorting)

1020
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:22,250
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

1021
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,325
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

1022
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:28,055
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1023
01:16:28,197 --> 01:16:31,257
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he? (chuckles)

1024
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,731
Indeed.

1025
01:16:35,237 --> 01:16:38,673
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1026
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:42,538
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1027
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:45,772
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1028
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:50,318
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1029
01:16:53,255 --> 01:16:55,120
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1030
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:57,282
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

1031
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:03,957
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

1032
01:17:04,099 --> 01:17:07,535
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

1033
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,570
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1034
01:17:09,705 --> 01:17:12,196
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

1035
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:16,971
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

1036
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:19,103
You lose sight of why we're here.

1037
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:21,079
- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.

1038
01:17:21,216 --> 01:17:23,741
Stop antagonizing Candie.

1039
01:17:23,886 --> 01:17:28,880
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

1040
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:33,723
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

1041
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:36,854
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

1042
01:17:36,999 --> 01:17:39,559
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

1043
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:46,007
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

1044
01:17:46,141 --> 01:17:47,938
and he didn't bat a eye.

1045
01:17:49,345 --> 01:17:50,471
You remember that?

1046
01:17:52,748 --> 01:17:54,113
Yeah, of course I remember.

1047
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:57,685
What you said was that
this is my world...

1048
01:17:58,654 --> 01:18:00,645
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

1049
01:18:01,657 --> 01:18:04,558
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

1050
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:11,358
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1051
01:18:12,835 --> 01:18:14,928
...that was the general gist.

1052
01:18:15,437 --> 01:18:16,597
(sighing)

1053
01:18:18,674 --> 01:18:20,164
See you at Candyland.

1054
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,476
(Django)
All right, niggers, back at it.

1055
01:18:31,787 --> 01:18:33,812
That means you too, Moonlight.

1056
01:18:42,664 --> 01:18:45,292
(dogs barking nearby)

1057
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:12,592
(dogs barking loudly)

1058
01:19:21,203 --> 01:19:24,104
(Calvin) I'll be. D'Artagnan!

1059
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,538
Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

1060
01:19:27,676 --> 01:19:29,769
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

1061
01:19:29,912 --> 01:19:31,243
(Calvin) Yes, you can.

1062
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,941
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

1063
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:37,552
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

1064
01:19:37,686 --> 01:19:40,348
- I cannot hear myself think!
- Quiet down, Marsha!

1065
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:42,548
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

1066
01:19:42,691 --> 01:19:44,249
Hush up! Hey!

1067
01:19:44,393 --> 01:19:47,055
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

1068
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:49,426
(dogs whining)

1069
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:59,996
Come on now, boy...
get on out that tree.

1070
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:01,837
Yessir.

1071
01:20:02,377 --> 01:20:04,038
(dogs resume barking)

1072
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:09,682
(barking stops)

1073
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,560
How long was he loose?

1074
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:29,967
(speech slurred)
A night. Day.

1075
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:31,732
Half the other night.

1076
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:34,433
How far he get off the property?

1077
01:20:34,576 --> 01:20:36,305
'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

1078
01:20:36,445 --> 01:20:38,606
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

1079
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:40,112
Hm.

1080
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:44,716
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1081
01:20:44,853 --> 01:20:46,480
One-a this new lot.

1082
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:50,420
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

1083
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:53,084
(D'Artagnan weeping) Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

1084
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:54,718
- Now, now, now, now, now.
- I can't...

1085
01:20:54,863 --> 01:20:57,331
Now, no beggin'.

1086
01:20:57,466 --> 01:20:59,934
No playin' on my soft heart.

1087
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:05,930
- You in trouble now, son.
- Yessir.

1088
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:12,439
I done paid $500 for you.

1089
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:17,484
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

1090
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:20,019
- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.

1091
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:24,057
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

1092
01:21:24,193 --> 01:21:26,957
- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

1093
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:28,619
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

1094
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:31,790
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

1095
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:32,958
Yessir.

1096
01:21:35,637 --> 01:21:37,696
Still, the fact remains:

1097
01:21:37,839 --> 01:21:41,502
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1098
01:21:41,643 --> 01:21:44,168
So what about my $500, huh?

1099
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:47,982
What about my $500?

1100
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:51,042
You gonna reimburse me?

1101
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:59,493
You even know what "reimburse" means?

1102
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:01,653
- (laughing)
- (Calvin) Huh?

1103
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:05,956
(laughter continues)

1104
01:22:07,936 --> 01:22:09,665
I'll reimburse you!

1105
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:14,602
You will?

1106
01:22:15,844 --> 01:22:17,368
Yep.

1107
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:22,879
You'll pay $500

1108
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:26,510
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1109
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:27,747
No, he won't.

1110
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:32,084
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1111
01:22:33,028 --> 01:22:35,019
Matter of fact, so am I.

1112
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:37,631
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1113
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:39,563
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1114
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:42,531
You heard him.

1115
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:55,479
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1116
01:22:55,617 --> 01:22:59,280
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1117
01:23:00,088 --> 01:23:02,056
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1118
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:05,760
That right.

1119
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:08,093
(Calvin) For that matter...

1120
01:23:09,398 --> 01:23:10,956
...nor have I.

1121
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:18,232
Now...

1122
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:22,536
...seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1123
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:28,346
...you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1124
01:23:29,484 --> 01:23:31,008
He's your nigger.

1125
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:36,883
Mr. Stonesipher?

1126
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:41,652
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1127
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:46,598
- Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!
- (barks echoing)

1128
01:23:48,036 --> 01:23:50,266
Get 'im, get 'im!

1129
01:23:51,306 --> 01:23:53,831
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1130
01:23:53,975 --> 01:23:55,374
Whoo-ee!

1131
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:03,243
- (dogs snarling)
- (screaming)

1132
01:24:23,772 --> 01:24:25,831
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1133
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:28,169
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1134
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:32,940
Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1135
01:24:33,515 --> 01:24:34,812
Hm.

1136
01:24:35,884 --> 01:24:37,317
You are used to it?

1137
01:24:37,452 --> 01:24:40,421
I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

1138
01:24:40,555 --> 01:24:45,288
- Hm.
- Now, Monsieur Candie...

1139
01:24:45,427 --> 01:24:47,088
...whenever you're ready.

1140
01:24:47,229 --> 01:24:50,630
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1141
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:52,393
Let's get to it.

1142
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:58,004
'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1143
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,641
Follow me.

1144
01:25:14,089 --> 01:25:15,920
(snarling)

1145
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:23,230
(clucking)

1146
01:25:23,365 --> 01:25:24,559
(nickering)

1147
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:01,623
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

1148
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:04,630
Stand up straight, now!

1149
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,097
Get up there.

1150
01:27:07,235 --> 01:27:09,863
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1151
01:27:10,005 --> 01:27:11,666
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1152
01:27:11,806 --> 01:27:13,865
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1153
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,794
(indistinct chatter)

1154
01:28:13,535 --> 01:28:15,196
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1155
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:18,033
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1156
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:21,142
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1157
01:28:21,276 --> 01:28:24,643
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?

1158
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:27,179
- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yessir. (laughs)

1159
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:30,910
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1160
01:28:31,052 --> 01:28:34,988
- Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
- (all chuckling)

1161
01:28:35,123 --> 01:28:38,991
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1162
01:28:39,127 --> 01:28:41,254
(laughing)

1163
01:28:41,396 --> 01:28:45,856
Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1164
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:47,662
Hey, Snowball?

1165
01:28:48,903 --> 01:28:52,498
Wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1166
01:28:52,641 --> 01:28:55,508
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1167
01:28:55,644 --> 01:28:57,339
I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there

1168
01:28:57,479 --> 01:28:58,912
- and in the mud so fast...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1169
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:01,140
...make your head spin.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1170
01:29:01,282 --> 01:29:05,616
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.

1171
01:29:05,754 --> 01:29:08,154
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1172
01:29:08,289 --> 01:29:10,553
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1173
01:29:10,692 --> 01:29:14,526
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1174
01:29:14,663 --> 01:29:17,962
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1175
01:29:18,099 --> 01:29:22,126
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1176
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:26,206
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1177
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:27,740
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1178
01:29:27,876 --> 01:29:31,437
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1179
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:33,979
- You understand that?
- Yessir. Him I understand.

1180
01:29:34,115 --> 01:29:35,810
But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.

1181
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:38,578
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1182
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:41,112
Yessir. I understand.

1183
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:43,724
Well, good.
They're spendin' the night.

1184
01:29:43,858 --> 01:29:45,985
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1185
01:29:47,162 --> 01:29:48,857
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1186
01:29:48,997 --> 01:29:51,227
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1187
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:53,994
- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem with that?

1188
01:29:54,135 --> 01:29:56,467
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1189
01:29:56,604 --> 01:29:58,663
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1190
01:29:58,807 --> 01:30:01,173
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1191
01:30:01,309 --> 01:30:03,573
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1192
01:30:03,712 --> 01:30:05,976
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1193
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:08,048
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1194
01:30:08,183 --> 01:30:09,810
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1195
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,854
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1196
01:30:15,323 --> 01:30:16,483
Go on, now.

1197
01:30:17,392 --> 01:30:19,860
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1198
01:30:19,994 --> 01:30:21,359
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1199
01:30:21,496 --> 01:30:25,057
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1200
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,394
Now...

1201
01:30:26,534 --> 01:30:31,233
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1202
01:30:31,372 --> 01:30:34,500
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1203
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:39,705
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1204
01:30:39,848 --> 01:30:43,841
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1205
01:30:45,086 --> 01:30:48,487
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1206
01:30:48,623 --> 01:30:52,059
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1207
01:30:52,193 --> 01:30:54,354
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1208
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:55,554
You know where it is.

1209
01:30:55,697 --> 01:30:57,426
Like you on a rope!

1210
01:30:58,633 --> 01:31:01,397
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1211
01:31:02,103 --> 01:31:05,129
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1212
01:31:05,273 --> 01:31:09,107
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1213
01:31:09,244 --> 01:31:10,233
Nigger gal?

1214
01:31:10,378 --> 01:31:13,404
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1215
01:31:13,548 --> 01:31:16,142
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1216
01:31:16,284 --> 01:31:20,482
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1217
01:31:20,622 --> 01:31:24,820
(laughs) You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1218
01:31:24,959 --> 01:31:28,360
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1219
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:30,361
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1220
01:31:30,498 --> 01:31:31,965
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1221
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,795
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1222
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:36,597
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1223
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:40,468
- What?
- (stammers) Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.

1224
01:31:41,976 --> 01:31:43,170
(Calvin) What's she doin' there?

1225
01:31:43,311 --> 01:31:46,109
(Stephen) What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1226
01:31:46,247 --> 01:31:47,737
She bein' punished.

1227
01:31:47,882 --> 01:31:50,248
- (Calvin) What she do?
- (Stephen) She run off again.

1228
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:53,081
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1229
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:55,712
- Two.
- When did she go?

1230
01:31:55,857 --> 01:31:58,417
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1231
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,222
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1232
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:05,657
(Stephen) Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1233
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:10,134
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1234
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:13,206
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1235
01:32:13,341 --> 01:32:14,603
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1236
01:32:14,742 --> 01:32:16,403
(Calvin)
How long she been in the box?

1237
01:32:16,544 --> 01:32:19,377
(Stephen) How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1238
01:32:19,514 --> 01:32:22,210
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1239
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:25,444
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1240
01:32:25,587 --> 01:32:29,523
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1241
01:32:29,657 --> 01:32:30,646
Hildi is my nigger.

1242
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:33,989
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1243
01:32:34,128 --> 01:32:37,359
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1244
01:32:37,498 --> 01:32:39,966
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1245
01:32:40,101 --> 01:32:42,569
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1246
01:32:42,704 --> 01:32:46,902
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1247
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:48,201
Yessir.

1248
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:52,138
(Calvin) Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1249
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:55,681
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1250
01:32:55,817 --> 01:32:57,216
(Lara Lee) Of course, darlin'.

1251
01:32:57,352 --> 01:33:02,255
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1252
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:05,257
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1253
01:33:07,729 --> 01:33:09,959
(clucking)

1254
01:33:10,098 --> 01:33:12,896
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1255
01:33:13,034 --> 01:33:15,594
Cora! Come here!

1256
01:33:15,737 --> 01:33:18,797
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1257
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,374
- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.

1258
01:33:21,509 --> 01:33:23,977
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1259
01:33:24,112 --> 01:33:27,513
- Yessir.
- (soft guitar music plays)

1260
01:34:08,389 --> 01:34:10,254
(Hildi screams)

1261
01:34:11,092 --> 01:34:13,788
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1262
01:34:14,996 --> 01:34:16,429
(Hildi yelling)

1263
01:34:16,564 --> 01:34:20,091
(gasping, screaming)

1264
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:23,836
(sobbing)

1265
01:34:43,825 --> 01:34:47,352
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1266
01:34:50,164 --> 01:34:52,758
(slow-tempo song plays)

1267
01:34:56,304 --> 01:34:58,932
(woman sings in foreign language)

1268
01:36:14,615 --> 01:36:15,809
(exhales)

1269
01:36:22,557 --> 01:36:24,047
Hello, ladies.

1270
01:36:24,192 --> 01:36:27,559
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1271
01:36:31,732 --> 01:36:34,200
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1272
01:36:35,636 --> 01:36:37,763
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1273
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,206
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1274
01:36:41,342 --> 01:36:44,140
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1275
01:36:44,278 --> 01:36:46,212
- (chuckles)
- (forced chuckle)

1276
01:36:47,381 --> 01:36:49,406
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1277
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:54,510
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1278
01:36:57,859 --> 01:37:00,157
The doctor here speaks German.

1279
01:37:02,163 --> 01:37:04,131
And I've been informed you do as well?

1280
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,861
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1281
01:37:09,971 --> 01:37:13,600
(speaking German)

1282
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:16,035
Ha! (laughs)

1283
01:37:16,177 --> 01:37:18,236
Astonishing.

1284
01:37:18,379 --> 01:37:20,006
(speaking German)

1285
01:37:25,153 --> 01:37:26,621
- And I shall bring you...
- (Schultz) Much obliged.

1286
01:37:26,621 --> 01:37:27,383
- And I shall bring you...
- (Schultz) Much obliged.

1287
01:37:36,898 --> 01:37:37,990
Ja.

1288
01:37:58,653 --> 01:38:00,245
(speaks German)

1289
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:02,855
Don't be afraid.

1290
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:43,453
Hm. Pardon.

1291
01:38:51,038 --> 01:38:52,335
Danke.

1292
01:39:36,183 --> 01:39:37,775
(chuckling)

1293
01:40:20,594 --> 01:40:22,619
(repeats German phrase)

1294
01:40:37,778 --> 01:40:39,336
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1295
01:40:39,947 --> 01:40:41,505
(gasping)

1296
01:40:43,951 --> 01:40:45,111
(moaning)

1297
01:40:47,955 --> 01:40:51,220
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1298
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:54,189
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.

1299
01:40:54,328 --> 01:40:55,625
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1300
01:40:55,763 --> 01:40:58,732
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1301
01:40:58,866 --> 01:41:01,664
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.

1302
01:41:01,802 --> 01:41:04,032
(laughs) That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1303
01:41:04,171 --> 01:41:06,799
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1304
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:12,743
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1305
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,249
But the best three by far were Samson...

1306
01:41:18,652 --> 01:41:20,244
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1307
01:41:20,388 --> 01:41:23,755
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1308
01:41:23,891 --> 01:41:26,519
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1309
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:29,754
(chuckles) You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1310
01:41:29,897 --> 01:41:32,525
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1311
01:41:32,666 --> 01:41:34,657
(all laugh)

1312
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:41,540
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1313
01:41:41,675 --> 01:41:45,406
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1314
01:41:45,546 --> 01:41:49,277
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1315
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:52,077
Samson's the champion.

1316
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:54,016
Them other two pretty good.

1317
01:41:55,322 --> 01:41:56,812
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1318
01:41:56,957 --> 01:41:58,117
It's all right.

1319
01:41:58,259 --> 01:42:00,386
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1320
01:42:00,528 --> 01:42:03,929
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1321
01:42:04,064 --> 01:42:08,398
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1322
01:42:08,536 --> 01:42:09,628
Is that right?

1323
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:13,900
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1324
01:42:14,041 --> 01:42:15,030
Hm.

1325
01:42:15,176 --> 01:42:17,610
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1326
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,610
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1327
01:42:21,749 --> 01:42:24,877
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1328
01:42:25,019 --> 01:42:27,783
- A sense of showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1329
01:42:27,922 --> 01:42:31,153
I want to be able to bill him
as The Black Hercules.

1330
01:42:31,292 --> 01:42:32,953
(all chuckling)

1331
01:42:33,093 --> 01:42:34,492
The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1332
01:42:34,628 --> 01:42:35,652
More like Nigger-les.

1333
01:42:35,796 --> 01:42:37,957
(laughing)

1334
01:42:38,098 --> 01:42:43,468
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1335
01:42:43,971 --> 01:42:46,804
...'the right nigger."'

1336
01:42:46,941 --> 01:42:51,275
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1337
01:42:51,412 --> 01:42:54,108
But is he right as rain?

1338
01:42:55,349 --> 01:42:56,816
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1339
01:42:56,951 --> 01:43:00,785
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1340
01:43:00,921 --> 01:43:02,855
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1341
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:04,787
more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.

1342
01:43:04,925 --> 01:43:05,949
Nobody.

1343
01:43:06,093 --> 01:43:07,924
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1344
01:43:08,095 --> 01:43:09,494
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1345
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:11,655
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1346
01:43:11,799 --> 01:43:13,027
Hm-mm.

1347
01:43:13,167 --> 01:43:17,433
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1348
01:43:17,571 --> 01:43:19,630
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1349
01:43:19,773 --> 01:43:23,732
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1350
01:43:23,878 --> 01:43:26,472
In other words, first thing is first.

1351
01:43:26,614 --> 01:43:28,047
First thing's first.

1352
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,512
(whispers in German)

1353
01:43:35,723 --> 01:43:39,159
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1354
01:43:39,293 --> 01:43:41,158
Famously.

1355
01:43:41,929 --> 01:43:44,625
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1356
01:43:44,765 --> 01:43:48,098
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1357
01:43:48,235 --> 01:43:50,135
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1358
01:43:50,271 --> 01:43:52,364
(laughing)

1359
01:43:52,506 --> 01:43:54,565
Two weeks in Boston!

1360
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:57,541
- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
- (coughing)

1361
01:43:57,678 --> 01:43:59,407
(Stephen) Two weeks in Boston!

1362
01:43:59,547 --> 01:44:04,814
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1363
01:44:04,952 --> 01:44:09,048
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1364
01:44:09,189 --> 01:44:11,089
(Calvin) Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1365
01:44:11,225 --> 01:44:12,590
You might-a caught yourself

1366
01:44:12,726 --> 01:44:14,023
- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1367
01:44:14,161 --> 01:44:16,254
(Calvin) Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1368
01:44:16,397 --> 01:44:18,422
- (Stephen) Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.

1369
01:44:18,566 --> 01:44:20,227
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1370
01:44:20,367 --> 01:44:23,359
Yessir, you stuck. (laughs)

1371
01:44:23,504 --> 01:44:25,062
(Lara Lee) I don't know, doctor.

1372
01:44:25,205 --> 01:44:27,469
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1373
01:44:27,608 --> 01:44:32,136
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1374
01:44:33,247 --> 01:44:34,407
(Lara Lee giggles)

1375
01:44:34,548 --> 01:44:37,039
Well, naturally.

1376
01:44:37,184 --> 01:44:40,813
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1377
01:44:40,955 --> 01:44:43,788
- not the plucked chicken.
- (all chuckle)

1378
01:44:43,924 --> 01:44:46,449
(Calvin) Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1379
01:44:46,594 --> 01:44:48,562
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1380
01:44:48,696 --> 01:44:49,754
(Cora) You got to clean these dishes,

1381
01:44:49,897 --> 01:44:51,922
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1382
01:44:52,066 --> 01:44:54,261
You know that nigger, don't you?

1383
01:44:55,202 --> 01:44:56,499
- Who?
- "Who?"

1384
01:44:56,637 --> 01:44:59,731
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1385
01:45:01,508 --> 01:45:03,533
At the table?

1386
01:45:03,677 --> 01:45:04,939
I don't know him.

1387
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:08,139
- You don't know him.
- No.

1388
01:45:08,282 --> 01:45:11,115
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1389
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:14,278
(chuckles)

1390
01:45:15,756 --> 01:45:18,224
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1391
01:45:22,429 --> 01:45:23,623
OK.

1392
01:45:24,898 --> 01:45:27,992
Yeah. If you say so.

1393
01:45:34,575 --> 01:45:37,908
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1394
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:44,478
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1395
01:45:44,618 --> 01:45:46,984
What would your price be?

1396
01:45:47,121 --> 01:45:49,112
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1397
01:45:49,256 --> 01:45:52,692
...and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1398
01:45:53,661 --> 01:45:56,926
...9,000. Maybe.

1399
01:45:58,165 --> 01:46:04,001
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1400
01:46:04,138 --> 01:46:06,333
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1401
01:46:06,473 --> 01:46:07,462
Sure wasn't.

1402
01:46:07,608 --> 01:46:09,337
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1403
01:46:09,476 --> 01:46:11,671
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure

1404
01:46:11,812 --> 01:46:14,280
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1405
01:46:14,415 --> 01:46:16,042
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1406
01:46:16,183 --> 01:46:19,175
- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.

1407
01:46:19,319 --> 01:46:23,551
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1408
01:46:24,191 --> 01:46:28,218
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1409
01:46:28,362 --> 01:46:31,195
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1410
01:46:35,869 --> 01:46:39,236
(deep inhale)

1411
01:46:39,373 --> 01:46:43,503
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1412
01:46:43,644 --> 01:46:44,906
(chuckles)

1413
01:46:47,381 --> 01:46:49,849
(slamming table) Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1414
01:46:49,983 --> 01:46:53,350
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- (banging table) Hooray, doctor.

1415
01:46:53,487 --> 01:46:55,648
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1416
01:46:55,789 --> 01:46:59,350
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1417
01:46:59,493 --> 01:47:02,690
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1418
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:04,627
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1419
01:47:04,765 --> 01:47:07,893
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1420
01:47:08,035 --> 01:47:11,095
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1421
01:47:11,238 --> 01:47:12,262
Hm-mm.

1422
01:47:12,406 --> 01:47:14,101
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1423
01:47:14,241 --> 01:47:16,903
- by a physician of my choosing.
- (Calvin) Naturally.

1424
01:47:17,044 --> 01:47:21,743
So, say I return in about...

1425
01:47:23,917 --> 01:47:26,249
...five days time.
- Five days?

1426
01:47:26,386 --> 01:47:27,683
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1427
01:47:27,821 --> 01:47:29,880
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1428
01:47:30,023 --> 01:47:32,958
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1429
01:47:33,794 --> 01:47:36,854
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1430
01:47:37,598 --> 01:47:38,758
Gentlemen...

1431
01:47:39,767 --> 01:47:41,758
...may I propose a toast.

1432
01:47:44,138 --> 01:47:49,075
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1433
01:47:49,209 --> 01:47:51,905
- (all chuckling)
- To The Black Hercules.

1434
01:47:52,045 --> 01:47:53,444
(Stephen) The Black Hercules.

1435
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:55,047
(speaks low)
To The Black Hercules.

1436
01:47:55,182 --> 01:47:59,050
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass. (chuckles)

1437
01:47:59,186 --> 01:48:00,619
Hm.

1438
01:48:00,754 --> 01:48:04,019
Hildi, top my drink off.

1439
01:48:07,094 --> 01:48:12,157
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1440
01:48:12,299 --> 01:48:15,564
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1441
01:48:15,702 --> 01:48:18,466
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1442
01:48:18,605 --> 01:48:21,403
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1443
01:48:21,542 --> 01:48:22,907
through a bramble bush.

1444
01:48:23,043 --> 01:48:26,137
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1445
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,907
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1446
01:48:28,048 --> 01:48:29,242
- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?

1447
01:48:29,383 --> 01:48:30,850
(Hildi) No, sir.

1448
01:48:30,984 --> 01:48:32,349
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1449
01:48:32,486 --> 01:48:36,183
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1450
01:48:36,323 --> 01:48:39,622
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1451
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,921
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1452
01:48:42,062 --> 01:48:45,122
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1453
01:48:45,265 --> 01:48:47,028
No, we just talked and...

1454
01:48:47,167 --> 01:48:49,567
(Calvin) Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1455
01:48:49,703 --> 01:48:51,534
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1456
01:48:51,672 --> 01:48:53,731
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1457
01:48:53,874 --> 01:48:57,002
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1458
01:48:57,144 --> 01:48:59,135
- Go on.
- (Lara Lee) Uh, Calvin.

1459
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:01,679
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1460
01:49:01,815 --> 01:49:04,750
(Calvin) But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dsseldorf.

1461
01:49:04,885 --> 01:49:07,945
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1462
01:49:08,088 --> 01:49:10,682
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1463
01:49:10,824 --> 01:49:14,419
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1464
01:49:14,561 --> 01:49:16,756
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1465
01:49:16,897 --> 01:49:18,831
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1466
01:49:19,032 --> 01:49:20,158
- (Stephen) Sure would.
- (Calvin) Look at that, doctor.

1467
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,530
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
- Calvin!

1468
01:49:23,337 --> 01:49:26,363
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1469
01:49:28,041 --> 01:49:30,509
- (exhales)
- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1470
01:49:30,644 --> 01:49:33,306
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1471
01:49:34,514 --> 01:49:36,311
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1472
01:49:42,689 --> 01:49:44,247
(Lara Lee)
Cora, come get this girl!

1473
01:49:44,391 --> 01:49:46,052
(approaching footsteps)

1474
01:49:47,694 --> 01:49:50,925
- (Lara Lee) She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. (gasps) Oh!

1475
01:49:51,064 --> 01:49:53,555
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1476
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:55,031
Come on in here.

1477
01:50:01,642 --> 01:50:05,373
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1478
01:50:05,512 --> 01:50:07,446
You say you ain't know him.

1479
01:50:08,582 --> 01:50:09,708
Huh?

1480
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:15,413
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1481
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:19,991
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1482
01:50:22,129 --> 01:50:23,756
Mr. Stephen...

1483
01:50:24,765 --> 01:50:25,789
...I don't.

1484
01:50:25,933 --> 01:50:28,424
Why is you lying to me?

1485
01:50:30,837 --> 01:50:32,202
I ain't.

1486
01:50:32,339 --> 01:50:34,864
Then why is you crying?

1487
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:37,203
You scarin' me.

1488
01:50:37,344 --> 01:50:41,246
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1489
01:50:42,916 --> 01:50:46,010
(Schultz) To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1490
01:50:46,153 --> 01:50:49,316
was positively soul-enriching.

1491
01:50:49,456 --> 01:50:52,357
(Calvin) Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1492
01:50:52,492 --> 01:50:55,325
You stay right here.

1493
01:51:00,701 --> 01:51:05,229
(Schultz) You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1494
01:51:05,372 --> 01:51:08,170
Why, yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1495
01:51:10,177 --> 01:51:16,173
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1496
01:51:16,316 --> 01:51:17,715
I'm all ears.

1497
01:51:17,851 --> 01:51:19,580
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1498
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:21,778
- Monsieur Candie...
- (Calvin) Stephen!

1499
01:51:22,823 --> 01:51:25,291
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1500
01:51:26,426 --> 01:51:28,553
(Stephen) I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1501
01:51:28,695 --> 01:51:31,459
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1502
01:51:31,598 --> 01:51:32,724
Excuse him.

1503
01:51:32,866 --> 01:51:36,666
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1504
01:51:36,803 --> 01:51:38,771
You mean get up out of my chair?

1505
01:51:38,905 --> 01:51:42,272
- Lf'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1506
01:51:42,409 --> 01:51:46,277
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1507
01:51:46,413 --> 01:51:49,041
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1508
01:51:49,182 --> 01:51:51,116
We're having white cake!

1509
01:51:51,251 --> 01:51:53,617
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1510
01:51:53,754 --> 01:51:58,123
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1511
01:51:58,258 --> 01:52:00,055
(whispers) Meet me in the library.

1512
01:52:00,193 --> 01:52:03,321
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1513
01:52:03,463 --> 01:52:05,363
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1514
01:52:05,499 --> 01:52:10,527
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1515
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:11,830
Yessir.

1516
01:52:12,739 --> 01:52:16,470
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1517
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:18,373
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1518
01:52:18,512 --> 01:52:22,175
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1519
01:52:22,315 --> 01:52:23,612
(all chuckle)

1520
01:52:25,152 --> 01:52:26,949
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1521
01:52:33,126 --> 01:52:34,889
(Calvin) You may clear
the dinner service.

1522
01:52:36,363 --> 01:52:39,764
(Cora) You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1523
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:45,361
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1524
01:52:45,505 --> 01:52:48,201
(chuckles) The circus?

1525
01:52:48,341 --> 01:52:49,831
(fire crackling)

1526
01:52:54,614 --> 01:52:56,411
What is the matter?

1527
01:53:01,688 --> 01:53:06,785
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1528
01:53:06,927 --> 01:53:10,488
- They wants that girl.
- (chuckling)

1529
01:53:10,630 --> 01:53:13,428
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1530
01:53:13,567 --> 01:53:16,764
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1531
01:53:16,903 --> 01:53:20,600
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1532
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:22,935
They here for that girl.

1533
01:53:23,076 --> 01:53:25,738
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1534
01:53:25,879 --> 01:53:29,508
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1535
01:53:31,218 --> 01:53:32,810
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1536
01:53:32,953 --> 01:53:35,387
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1537
01:53:35,522 --> 01:53:37,990
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1538
01:53:38,125 --> 01:53:40,423
But he's just about to buy

1539
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,791
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1540
01:53:43,930 --> 01:53:46,922
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1541
01:53:52,339 --> 01:53:54,364
Where you gettin' all this?

1542
01:53:55,475 --> 01:53:57,306
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1543
01:53:57,444 --> 01:53:59,969
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1544
01:54:00,113 --> 01:54:04,447
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1545
01:54:04,584 --> 01:54:06,449
She probably his wife.

1546
01:54:06,586 --> 01:54:09,419
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1547
01:54:09,556 --> 01:54:12,616
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1548
01:54:15,195 --> 01:54:17,163
If she's who they want...

1549
01:54:17,764 --> 01:54:22,098
...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1550
01:54:22,235 --> 01:54:25,727
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1551
01:54:25,872 --> 01:54:31,333
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1552
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,741
Yes, it did.

1553
01:54:39,085 --> 01:54:40,677
His wife, huh?

1554
01:54:44,558 --> 01:54:48,324
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1555
01:54:48,461 --> 01:54:49,860
(chuckles)

1556
01:54:51,598 --> 01:54:53,566
Those lying...

1557
01:54:54,434 --> 01:55:00,395
...goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1558
01:55:02,642 --> 01:55:04,010
Sons of bitches!

1559
01:55:04,511 --> 01:55:09,210
...out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1560
01:55:10,483 --> 01:55:11,973
Oh, there you are.

1561
01:55:12,118 --> 01:55:14,916
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1562
01:55:15,055 --> 01:55:16,545
(all chuckling)

1563
01:55:16,690 --> 01:55:18,885
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1564
01:55:19,025 --> 01:55:22,153
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1565
01:55:22,295 --> 01:55:25,355
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1566
01:55:25,498 --> 01:55:26,590
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1567
01:55:26,733 --> 01:55:30,669
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1568
01:55:30,804 --> 01:55:33,034
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1569
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:50,016
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1570
01:55:52,058 --> 01:55:55,027
Apropos, before your exit,

1571
01:55:55,161 --> 01:55:59,188
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1572
01:55:59,332 --> 01:56:02,267
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1573
01:56:02,402 --> 01:56:04,529
And we will again. In a moment.

1574
01:56:20,987 --> 01:56:23,046
Who's your little friend?

1575
01:56:25,425 --> 01:56:26,449
(clearing throat)

1576
01:56:27,994 --> 01:56:29,518
This is Ben.

1577
01:56:30,864 --> 01:56:35,892
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1578
01:56:36,036 --> 01:56:38,436
And I do mean a long damn time.

1579
01:56:39,539 --> 01:56:43,270
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1580
01:56:44,144 --> 01:56:46,203
...and my daddy's daddy.

1581
01:56:46,346 --> 01:56:48,940
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1582
01:56:51,785 --> 01:56:53,446
...Old Ben took care of me.

1583
01:56:56,056 --> 01:56:59,856
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1584
01:56:59,993 --> 01:57:05,898
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1585
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:12,802
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1586
01:57:14,074 --> 01:57:17,840
...surrounded by black faces.

1587
01:57:19,879 --> 01:57:22,245
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1588
01:57:22,382 --> 01:57:25,579
I only had one question:

1589
01:57:29,289 --> 01:57:31,723
- Why don't they kill us?
- (laughs)

1590
01:57:34,761 --> 01:57:39,960
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1591
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:45,037
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1592
01:57:45,171 --> 01:57:50,336
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1593
01:57:50,477 --> 01:57:53,878
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1594
01:57:56,449 --> 01:57:57,939
But he never did.

1595
01:57:59,819 --> 01:58:01,116
Why not?

1596
01:58:02,489 --> 01:58:07,324
You see, the science of phrenology

1597
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:12,523
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1598
01:58:14,367 --> 01:58:18,098
In the skull of the African here,

1599
01:58:18,238 --> 01:58:20,399
the area associated
with submissiveness

1600
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:26,035
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1601
01:58:27,147 --> 01:58:28,808
(sawing)

1602
01:58:41,561 --> 01:58:43,529
If you examine...

1603
01:58:44,898 --> 01:58:47,059
...this piece of skull here...

1604
01:58:53,373 --> 01:58:56,934
...you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1605
01:59:00,547 --> 01:59:04,278
Here, here and here.

1606
01:59:04,417 --> 01:59:05,714
Now...

1607
01:59:05,852 --> 01:59:10,846
...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1608
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:13,515
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1609
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:16,993
most associated with... creativity.

1610
01:59:17,697 --> 01:59:19,528
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1611
01:59:20,133 --> 01:59:22,294
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1612
01:59:22,435 --> 01:59:24,767
unburdened by genius,

1613
01:59:24,904 --> 01:59:29,068
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1614
01:59:30,210 --> 01:59:31,507
...servility.

1615
01:59:32,545 --> 01:59:34,274
Now, Bright Boy...

1616
01:59:35,181 --> 01:59:37,376
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1617
01:59:39,819 --> 01:59:41,912
But if I took this hammer here...

1618
01:59:44,057 --> 01:59:46,355
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1619
01:59:47,393 --> 01:59:52,729
...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1620
01:59:53,967 --> 01:59:55,434
...as Old Ben.

1621
01:59:56,569 --> 02:00:00,164
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1622
02:00:00,306 --> 02:00:03,298
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1623
02:00:03,443 --> 02:00:06,674
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1624
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:10,943
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1625
02:00:11,084 --> 02:00:13,450
but that you can believe!

1626
02:00:13,586 --> 02:00:16,384
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1627
02:00:16,523 --> 02:00:18,889
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1628
02:00:23,630 --> 02:00:26,030
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1629
02:00:30,603 --> 02:00:31,968
Where were we?

1630
02:00:36,442 --> 02:00:37,841
Jackass.

1631
02:00:41,848 --> 02:00:43,372
Ah, yes.

1632
02:00:43,516 --> 02:00:46,280
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1633
02:00:46,419 --> 02:00:48,910
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1634
02:00:49,055 --> 02:00:50,454
Am I right?

1635
02:00:54,427 --> 02:00:55,792
Right.

1636
02:00:58,197 --> 02:00:59,687
Bring out Hildi!

1637
02:01:02,468 --> 02:01:03,992
Get over there yonder.

1638
02:01:05,438 --> 02:01:07,736
- (screams)
- Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1639
02:01:07,874 --> 02:01:09,136
(Stephen) Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1640
02:01:09,275 --> 02:01:10,833
(Calvin) Now shut your mouth!

1641
02:01:15,148 --> 02:01:17,742
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1642
02:01:17,884 --> 02:01:20,682
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1643
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:25,154
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1644
02:01:25,291 --> 02:01:28,385
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1645
02:01:28,528 --> 02:01:32,464
To which you said, "$12,000."

1646
02:01:33,266 --> 02:01:35,063
- (yells)
- Now, considering y'all

1647
02:01:35,201 --> 02:01:37,169
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1648
02:01:37,303 --> 02:01:41,296
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1649
02:01:41,441 --> 02:01:43,909
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1650
02:01:44,043 --> 02:01:50,039
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1651
02:01:50,183 --> 02:01:53,949
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1652
02:01:54,087 --> 02:01:59,753
the price is $12,000.

1653
02:01:59,892 --> 02:02:03,658
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1654
02:02:05,932 --> 02:02:07,456
Yes, I do, doctor.

1655
02:02:08,301 --> 02:02:11,327
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1656
02:02:11,471 --> 02:02:15,032
Broomhilda here is my property.

1657
02:02:15,174 --> 02:02:20,305
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1658
02:02:21,414 --> 02:02:23,712
And if y'all think my price...

1659
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:27,114
...for this nigger here
is too steep...

1660
02:02:27,253 --> 02:02:30,711
- (grunts)
...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1661
02:02:34,627 --> 02:02:37,790
...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1662
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:40,091
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1663
02:02:40,233 --> 02:02:44,761
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1664
02:02:44,904 --> 02:02:49,102
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1665
02:02:49,242 --> 02:02:50,573
- (Hildi whimpering)
- What's it gonna be?

1666
02:02:50,710 --> 02:02:54,612
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1667
02:02:55,815 --> 02:02:57,146
Yes, you may.

1668
02:03:10,930 --> 02:03:12,124
That 12.

1669
02:03:16,169 --> 02:03:18,069
- Sold!
- (screaming)

1670
02:03:18,204 --> 02:03:20,764
To the man with the exceptional beard

1671
02:03:20,907 --> 02:03:24,274
and his unexceptional nigger.

1672
02:03:30,083 --> 02:03:32,415
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1673
02:03:32,552 --> 02:03:36,249
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1674
02:03:36,389 --> 02:03:38,152
$12,000.

1675
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:43,421
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1676
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:46,059
Now, gentlemen...

1677
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:49,165
...if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1678
02:03:50,136 --> 02:03:52,570
...we will be serving white cake.

1679
02:03:53,439 --> 02:03:54,874
(Beethoven's "Fur Elise"
played on harp)

1680
02:04:52,398 --> 02:04:53,057
- (screaming)
- (dogs snarling)

1681
02:05:08,447 --> 02:05:09,914
(screaming)

1682
02:05:20,927 --> 02:05:22,258
Well done, Calvin.

1683
02:05:24,764 --> 02:05:27,631
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1684
02:05:29,101 --> 02:05:32,764
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1685
02:05:37,009 --> 02:05:38,135
(Stephen) Doctor!

1686
02:05:38,277 --> 02:05:40,905
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1687
02:05:41,047 --> 02:05:42,275
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1688
02:05:42,415 --> 02:05:43,780
Let it be.

1689
02:05:43,916 --> 02:05:45,850
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1690
02:05:45,985 --> 02:05:47,418
I'll handle this.

1691
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:14,541
White cake?

1692
02:06:15,548 --> 02:06:17,812
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1693
02:06:18,851 --> 02:06:20,045
Hm.

1694
02:06:24,824 --> 02:06:25,813
(Calvin chuckles softly)

1695
02:06:27,793 --> 02:06:30,489
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1696
02:06:31,197 --> 02:06:35,998
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1697
02:06:36,135 --> 02:06:37,966
D'Artagnan.

1698
02:06:38,738 --> 02:06:42,572
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1699
02:06:42,708 --> 02:06:44,175
Come again?

1700
02:06:47,246 --> 02:06:51,342
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote The Three Musketeers.

1701
02:06:51,484 --> 02:06:53,179
Yes, of course, doctor.

1702
02:06:53,319 --> 02:06:54,877
I figured you must be an admirer.

1703
02:06:55,021 --> 02:06:59,458
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1704
02:06:59,592 --> 02:07:03,358
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1705
02:07:03,496 --> 02:07:05,430
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1706
02:07:07,466 --> 02:07:09,297
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1707
02:07:11,537 --> 02:07:16,702
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1708
02:07:19,011 --> 02:07:20,774
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1709
02:07:22,682 --> 02:07:24,877
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1710
02:07:28,721 --> 02:07:31,554
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1711
02:07:31,691 --> 02:07:33,352
- May I?
- Of course.

1712
02:07:33,492 --> 02:07:34,891
Thank you.

1713
02:07:37,029 --> 02:07:39,998
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1714
02:07:40,132 --> 02:07:42,327
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1715
02:07:42,468 --> 02:07:44,698
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1716
02:07:45,938 --> 02:07:48,839
- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.

1717
02:08:10,162 --> 02:08:11,390
Thank you.

1718
02:08:14,967 --> 02:08:17,265
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1719
02:08:19,505 --> 02:08:21,871
...consider yourself a free woman.

1720
02:08:33,819 --> 02:08:35,787
Mr. Candie...

1721
02:08:37,723 --> 02:08:41,557
...normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1722
02:08:41,694 --> 02:08:46,188
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1723
02:08:46,332 --> 02:08:48,698
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1724
02:08:48,834 --> 02:08:53,498
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1725
02:08:57,376 --> 02:08:58,673
Let's go.

1726
02:08:59,645 --> 02:09:01,169
Come on.

1727
02:09:02,882 --> 02:09:04,975
One more moment, doctor!

1728
02:09:06,852 --> 02:09:07,876
What?

1729
02:09:12,625 --> 02:09:14,718
It's a custom here in the South...

1730
02:09:15,227 --> 02:09:20,597
...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1731
02:09:21,467 --> 02:09:23,526
It implies good faith.

1732
02:09:23,669 --> 02:09:26,729
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1733
02:09:26,872 --> 02:09:29,170
...in my house, doctor.

1734
02:09:30,042 --> 02:09:32,977
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1735
02:09:33,112 --> 02:09:35,171
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1736
02:09:35,314 --> 02:09:38,579
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1737
02:09:39,218 --> 02:09:42,244
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1738
02:09:42,388 --> 02:09:44,185
No, I don't.

1739
02:09:45,858 --> 02:09:51,091
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1740
02:09:51,230 --> 02:09:56,224
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1741
02:09:56,368 --> 02:09:58,962
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1742
02:09:59,872 --> 02:10:02,705
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit...

1743
02:10:03,676 --> 02:10:07,168
...you don't shake my hand.

1744
02:10:08,114 --> 02:10:13,814
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1745
02:10:13,953 --> 02:10:15,716
I don't think so.

1746
02:10:16,722 --> 02:10:17,882
Mr. Pooch?

1747
02:10:19,725 --> 02:10:24,458
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1748
02:10:24,597 --> 02:10:26,360
you cut her ass down.

1749
02:10:29,268 --> 02:10:30,599
(cocking shotgun)

1750
02:10:48,387 --> 02:10:51,686
You really want me to shake your hand?

1751
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:54,951
I insist.

1752
02:10:56,028 --> 02:10:58,690
If you insist.

1753
02:11:01,033 --> 02:11:02,261
(metal springing noise)

1754
02:11:15,314 --> 02:11:18,306
No! Calvin!

1755
02:11:19,418 --> 02:11:21,010
Calvin!

1756
02:11:21,153 --> 02:11:23,485
(slow heartbeat rhythm)

1757
02:11:27,326 --> 02:11:29,817
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1758
02:11:32,665 --> 02:11:34,394
(sobbing)

1759
02:11:42,074 --> 02:11:44,304
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1760
02:11:44,443 --> 02:11:46,240
- (screaming)
- Help, he's killing everyone!

1761
02:11:46,378 --> 02:11:48,073
- (gunshot)
- (screaming)

1762
02:11:52,184 --> 02:11:53,242
Ah! (screams)

1763
02:11:53,385 --> 02:11:54,545
(grunting)

1764
02:11:58,090 --> 02:11:59,523
(screaming)

1765
02:12:03,295 --> 02:12:04,421
Holy...!

1766
02:12:04,563 --> 02:12:06,793
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1767
02:12:07,533 --> 02:12:09,524
(overlapping gunfire)

1768
02:12:10,936 --> 02:12:12,198
(man) Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1769
02:12:12,338 --> 02:12:14,670
- Get the...!
- (screaming continues)

1770
02:12:16,675 --> 02:12:18,142
(man) Damn it, son of a bitch!

1771
02:12:18,277 --> 02:12:19,869
What...? Fucking...

1772
02:12:20,012 --> 02:12:21,639
Goddamn it!

1773
02:12:22,982 --> 02:12:25,280
- What the fuck is going on?
- (screams)

1774
02:12:25,417 --> 02:12:27,408
You shot me!

1775
02:12:27,553 --> 02:12:30,647
- You stupid son of a bitch!
- (man) Sorry, Jessie!

1776
02:12:30,789 --> 02:12:34,919
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

1777
02:12:46,872 --> 02:12:48,362
(whimpering)

1778
02:12:51,710 --> 02:12:53,200
(screaming)

1779
02:12:58,617 --> 02:13:01,279
(yelling)

1780
02:13:04,957 --> 02:13:06,083
(man) Aim low!

1781
02:13:08,427 --> 02:13:10,258
Nigger! Gonna kill...!

1782
02:13:11,230 --> 02:13:13,425
(screams) God! Oh, my God!

1783
02:13:13,565 --> 02:13:15,533
(man continues screaming)
Motherfucker!

1784
02:13:15,668 --> 02:13:17,499
(slow-motion gunshot)

1785
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:23,931
(rap song playing)

1786
02:13:24,376 --> 02:13:25,502
Shit!

1787
02:13:26,745 --> 02:13:27,609
(screaming)

1788
02:14:22,501 --> 02:14:23,627
Shit.

1789
02:14:23,769 --> 02:14:24,793
(door squeaks open)

1790
02:14:33,512 --> 02:14:35,639
(overlapping gunshots)

1791
02:14:35,781 --> 02:14:37,180
(Stephen) Hold your fire!

1792
02:14:40,619 --> 02:14:42,086
Hold your fire!

1793
02:14:44,022 --> 02:14:45,887
Stop shootin', goddamn it!

1794
02:14:46,892 --> 02:14:48,223
(gunfire stops)

1795
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:56,065
Django!

1796
02:14:56,201 --> 02:14:57,463
What?

1797
02:15:00,672 --> 02:15:02,264
We got your woman!

1798
02:15:03,709 --> 02:15:06,234
Billy Crash here got his pistol
upside her head.

1799
02:15:06,378 --> 02:15:09,006
- (gasping)
- You don't stop all that carrying on,

1800
02:15:09,148 --> 02:15:12,208
- he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
- (gasping)

1801
02:15:12,351 --> 02:15:16,310
And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
That there is a promise.

1802
02:15:17,923 --> 02:15:19,185
Or...

1803
02:15:19,324 --> 02:15:22,316
...you can give up,
throw your gun out...

1804
02:15:23,429 --> 02:15:25,624
...we won't kill Hildi.
- Horseshit!

1805
02:15:25,764 --> 02:15:29,461
Honest Injun, Django.
I swear 'fore God.

1806
02:15:30,569 --> 02:15:35,199
You give up,
ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1807
02:15:36,642 --> 02:15:39,110
And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?

1808
02:15:39,244 --> 02:15:41,974
Personally, I don't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1809
02:15:42,114 --> 02:15:45,208
I believe if you don't
give up in the next ten seconds,

1810
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:49,218
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!

1811
02:15:51,457 --> 02:15:55,257
Don't do it. (sniffling)
You give me up.

1812
02:15:55,394 --> 02:15:57,259
- (Stephen) Six!
- Just let me go.

1813
02:15:57,396 --> 02:15:58,954
- Seven!
- They got too much.

1814
02:15:59,097 --> 02:16:00,724
- (Hildi) Django.
- (Stephen) Eight!

1815
02:16:00,866 --> 02:16:03,357
- I love you.
- Nine!

1816
02:16:03,502 --> 02:16:05,595
- (Django) Hold it!
- No.

1817
02:16:07,606 --> 02:16:08,664
I give up.

1818
02:16:09,908 --> 02:16:12,672
I can't hear you, nigger.

1819
02:16:12,811 --> 02:16:15,302
I said I give up!

1820
02:16:25,624 --> 02:16:29,151
(up-tempo song plays)

1821
02:16:38,437 --> 02:16:40,962
No! (sobbing)

1822
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:43,607
No!

1823
02:17:50,809 --> 02:17:53,801
(door opening)

1824
02:17:53,946 --> 02:17:56,312
(spurs clinking)

1825
02:18:14,866 --> 02:18:17,426
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1826
02:18:22,741 --> 02:18:24,868
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1827
02:18:25,844 --> 02:18:28,574
I knew there was something
fishy about y'all.

1828
02:18:29,581 --> 02:18:31,776
We found your wanted posters...

1829
02:18:32,384 --> 02:18:34,579
...and book of figures
in your saddlebags.

1830
02:18:35,988 --> 02:18:37,615
I got to say...

1831
02:18:38,357 --> 02:18:41,656
...I ain't never heard of
no black bounty hunter before.

1832
02:18:41,793 --> 02:18:44,819
Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?

1833
02:18:45,897 --> 02:18:48,525
Probably pretty good while it lasted,
huh?

1834
02:18:50,569 --> 02:18:52,036
(sizzling)

1835
02:18:54,673 --> 02:18:56,641
(Django yells, muffled)

1836
02:18:56,775 --> 02:18:57,833
(grunting)

1837
02:18:57,976 --> 02:18:59,841
Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie.

1838
02:18:59,978 --> 02:19:02,674
- (yelling)
- On three. One...

1839
02:19:02,814 --> 02:19:05,749
- (screaming)
- I got you. Two...

1840
02:19:05,884 --> 02:19:09,115
- (screaming)
- Calm down, now, here it comes.

1841
02:19:09,254 --> 02:19:11,848
- (screaming)
- (Stephen) Captain?

1842
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:13,753
Miss Lara want to see you.

1843
02:19:14,593 --> 02:19:18,529
Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1844
02:19:18,664 --> 02:19:22,464
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snipping Django.

1845
02:19:23,268 --> 02:19:26,135
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1846
02:19:26,271 --> 02:19:27,795
(Django moaning)

1847
02:19:27,939 --> 02:19:30,066
Well, she didn't
waste a minute telling me.

1848
02:19:37,315 --> 02:19:39,112
How disappointing.

1849
02:19:45,624 --> 02:19:47,421
(hissing)

1850
02:19:47,559 --> 02:19:48,924
(chuckles)

1851
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:03,371
(Stephen) You leavin'.

1852
02:20:05,043 --> 02:20:08,103
This here what you take with you.

1853
02:20:11,483 --> 02:20:14,975
Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House

1854
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,556
could talk about
for the last few hours.

1855
02:20:18,690 --> 02:20:22,421
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life

1856
02:20:22,561 --> 02:20:25,291
was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1857
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:30,766
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1858
02:20:30,902 --> 02:20:36,465
Now, that may seem like a good idea,
but truth is...

1859
02:20:38,043 --> 02:20:40,307
...when you snip a nigger's nuts,

1860
02:20:40,445 --> 02:20:44,711
most of them bleed out in,
oh, about, hm... seven minutes.

1861
02:20:44,850 --> 02:20:46,408
Most of 'em.

1862
02:20:46,618 --> 02:20:49,815
(chuckles)
Well, more than most.

1863
02:20:50,555 --> 02:20:56,425
Then I says: "Shitfire.

1864
02:20:56,561 --> 02:21:00,554
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1865
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:04,330
And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death."

1866
02:21:04,469 --> 02:21:07,802
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1867
02:21:07,939 --> 02:21:11,204
And I said,
"What's so special about that?

1868
02:21:11,343 --> 02:21:13,470
We do that shit all the time.

1869
02:21:13,612 --> 02:21:19,482
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1870
02:21:20,619 --> 02:21:23,383
Lo and behold,

1871
02:21:23,522 --> 02:21:28,391
out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea

1872
02:21:28,527 --> 02:21:31,963
of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1873
02:21:34,366 --> 02:21:39,497
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1874
02:21:39,638 --> 02:21:43,233
henceforth, till the day you die,

1875
02:21:43,375 --> 02:21:46,503
all day, every day,

1876
02:21:46,645 --> 02:21:49,512
you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,

1877
02:21:49,648 --> 02:21:54,312
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1878
02:21:54,452 --> 02:21:59,082
Now, when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1879
02:21:59,224 --> 02:22:02,159
give you a number
and a sledgehammer,

1880
02:22:02,294 --> 02:22:04,762
and say, "Get to work!"

1881
02:22:04,896 --> 02:22:07,330
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1882
02:22:07,465 --> 02:22:09,831
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1883
02:22:09,968 --> 02:22:13,665
Oh, they does that real good.

1884
02:22:13,805 --> 02:22:15,397
They gonna work ya.

1885
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:20,603
All day, every day,
till your back give out.

1886
02:22:20,745 --> 02:22:23,339
Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

1887
02:22:23,481 --> 02:22:25,915
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1888
02:22:26,051 --> 02:22:31,455
And that will be the story of you,
Django.

1889
02:22:33,091 --> 02:22:34,922
(slow-tempo song plays)

1890
02:23:10,495 --> 02:23:12,963
(man, Australian accent) And what's
the golden rule, Frankie, eh?

1891
02:23:13,098 --> 02:23:15,225
You don't root abos.

1892
02:23:20,005 --> 02:23:21,438
Hey, white boy.

1893
02:23:23,008 --> 02:23:25,203
I said, hey, white boy.

1894
02:23:25,343 --> 02:23:28,437
Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I want to hear.

1895
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:30,912
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1896
02:23:31,049 --> 02:23:32,243
Do what, now?

1897
02:23:32,384 --> 02:23:38,220
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
11,500, actually.

1898
02:23:38,356 --> 02:23:40,347
What the fuck are you talking about?

1899
02:23:40,492 --> 02:23:45,191
Back there at that plantation,
Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,

1900
02:23:45,330 --> 02:23:48,128
just sittin' there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1901
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:50,829
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1902
02:23:50,969 --> 02:23:55,235
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1903
02:23:55,373 --> 02:23:56,806
You can't steal it.

1904
02:23:56,942 --> 02:23:58,603
You got to earn it, white boy.

1905
02:23:59,577 --> 02:24:01,602
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

1906
02:24:01,746 --> 02:24:04,977
The $11,500 fortune waitin'
for you back at Candyland

1907
02:24:05,116 --> 02:24:07,277
is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

1908
02:24:07,419 --> 02:24:09,785
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

1909
02:24:09,921 --> 02:24:11,411
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1910
02:24:11,556 --> 02:24:14,889
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1911
02:24:15,026 --> 02:24:16,618
the Bacall Gang.

1912
02:24:16,761 --> 02:24:20,060
There's a $ 7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,

1913
02:24:20,198 --> 02:24:23,565
$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:

1914
02:24:23,702 --> 02:24:26,967
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

1915
02:24:27,105 --> 02:24:29,835
and Crazy Craig Koons.

1916
02:24:29,975 --> 02:24:31,442
Now, all four of them gentlemen,

1917
02:24:31,576 --> 02:24:33,737
they back there at Candyland
laughing their ass off.

1918
02:24:33,878 --> 02:24:37,575
You know why?
'Cause they just got away with murder.

1919
02:24:37,716 --> 02:24:39,274
But it ain't got to be that way.

1920
02:24:39,417 --> 02:24:42,750
You and your mates, y'all can ride back
there and y'all can go get that money.

1921
02:24:42,887 --> 02:24:43,979
What'd these jokers do again?

1922
02:24:44,122 --> 02:24:47,649
These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

1923
02:24:47,792 --> 02:24:51,057
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.

1924
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:55,156
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1925
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:56,460
Get it out.

1926
02:24:58,236 --> 02:25:03,503
(man 1) "Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty
Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."

1927
02:25:03,641 --> 02:25:05,006
- (man 2) But you're a slave.
- (man 1) "For murder..."

1928
02:25:05,143 --> 02:25:07,668
- (Django) I ain't no goddamn slave.
- (man 1) "...and stagecoach robbery."

1929
02:25:07,812 --> 02:25:09,074
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1930
02:25:09,414 --> 02:25:10,881
- (man 1) "$ 7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
- Hm?

1931
02:25:11,016 --> 02:25:13,814
- (man 2) That's a shitload.
- I'm a bounty hunter.

1932
02:25:15,253 --> 02:25:17,847
Yesterday, as a free man,

1933
02:25:17,989 --> 02:25:22,551
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

1934
02:25:22,694 --> 02:25:24,286
Dr. King Schultz.

1935
02:25:24,429 --> 02:25:29,196
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1936
02:25:29,334 --> 02:25:32,269
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

1937
02:25:32,404 --> 02:25:35,931
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1938
02:25:36,074 --> 02:25:39,441
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

1939
02:25:39,577 --> 02:25:43,775
then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.

1940
02:25:45,784 --> 02:25:47,718
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1941
02:25:47,852 --> 02:25:50,685
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1942
02:25:50,822 --> 02:25:54,189
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

1943
02:25:54,325 --> 02:25:57,624
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

1944
02:25:57,762 --> 02:26:00,060
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

1945
02:26:00,198 --> 02:26:01,995
(man 1) What's the deal?

1946
02:26:02,133 --> 02:26:05,591
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1947
02:26:05,737 --> 02:26:08,672
No, no, no, no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1948
02:26:08,807 --> 02:26:12,334
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

1949
02:26:12,477 --> 02:26:17,005
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1950
02:26:17,148 --> 02:26:19,048
This is a real handbill.

1951
02:26:19,184 --> 02:26:20,242
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1952
02:26:20,385 --> 02:26:22,512
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

1953
02:26:22,654 --> 02:26:28,726
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1954
02:26:33,231 --> 02:26:36,029
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

1955
02:26:42,373 --> 02:26:46,309
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1956
02:26:47,545 --> 02:26:50,173
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1957
02:26:50,882 --> 02:26:52,747
Is he a Candyland slave,

1958
02:26:52,884 --> 02:26:56,684
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1959
02:26:56,821 --> 02:27:00,552
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

1960
02:27:00,692 --> 02:27:03,217
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1961
02:27:03,895 --> 02:27:08,093
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

1962
02:27:08,233 --> 02:27:09,757
He weren't no slave.

1963
02:27:09,901 --> 02:27:13,735
- You fuckin' sure about that?
- Damn sure.

1964
02:27:17,675 --> 02:27:21,270
- What happened over in Candyland?
- Bunch-a shootin'.

1965
02:27:21,412 --> 02:27:23,209
Massa got shot.

1966
02:27:23,348 --> 02:27:25,509
- Who shot him?
- The German.

1967
02:27:25,650 --> 02:27:26,708
Why'd he do that?

1968
02:27:27,352 --> 02:27:30,844
Nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1969
02:27:30,989 --> 02:27:34,083
- Well, what were they?
- Bounty hunters.

1970
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:38,493
Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.

1971
02:27:39,531 --> 02:27:42,762
Well, smoke, you got a deal.

1972
02:27:44,269 --> 02:27:47,136
- I got one more condition.
- What's that?

1973
02:27:47,272 --> 02:27:51,038
When we get there, when time come...

1974
02:27:52,443 --> 02:27:55,435
...you let me help you kill 'em.
- Hey... (laughs)

1975
02:27:55,580 --> 02:27:57,241
...you're a funny bugger.

1976
02:27:57,382 --> 02:27:59,816
- Cut him loose.
- Yeah, yeah.

1977
02:27:59,951 --> 02:28:01,782
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1978
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,081
(mimics accent)
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1979
02:28:04,222 --> 02:28:05,985
Hey! (laughs)

1980
02:28:06,124 --> 02:28:07,489
You're all right for a black fella.

1981
02:28:07,625 --> 02:28:08,853
Oh, yeah.

1982
02:28:14,098 --> 02:28:15,759
There we go.
There you go, mate.

1983
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:17,333
Yeah.

1984
02:28:17,468 --> 02:28:20,164
We're gonna give you
that packhorse over there.

1985
02:28:20,305 --> 02:28:22,296
What them saddlebags got in 'em?

1986
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:24,340
- Dynamite.
- No. I ain't ridin' no horse

1987
02:28:24,475 --> 02:28:26,409
with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

1988
02:28:26,544 --> 02:28:28,478
I can understand that.

1989
02:28:28,613 --> 02:28:31,446
Frankie, why don't you
take them sticks off that horse

1990
02:28:31,583 --> 02:28:33,414
and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1991
02:28:35,053 --> 02:28:37,248
A little dynamite for you
black fellas to play with.

1992
02:28:37,388 --> 02:28:39,447
(laughs)

1993
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:51,496
Now, Floyd, you got that
rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?

1994
02:28:51,636 --> 02:28:52,625
Yeah, right.

1995
02:28:52,770 --> 02:28:55,364
Why don't you give him
your gun and gun belt?

1996
02:28:55,506 --> 02:28:56,837
Righto.

1997
02:28:56,975 --> 02:29:00,103
Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing,
all right?

1998
02:29:00,245 --> 02:29:03,214
I've just had the sights fixed
and they're perfect.

1999
02:29:03,348 --> 02:29:04,440
Oh, that's good to know.

2000
02:29:08,219 --> 02:29:11,279
- (all yelling)
- (horses whinnying)

2001
02:29:11,422 --> 02:29:14,414
(medium-tempo song plays)

2002
02:30:36,841 --> 02:30:38,570
Throw me up that dynamite.

2003
02:31:33,798 --> 02:31:37,063
(medium-tempo song plays)

2004
02:31:45,676 --> 02:31:47,667
(dogs barking outside)

2005
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,627
- (man) Jake!
- Yeah?

2006
02:32:10,768 --> 02:32:14,135
Get out there and see what's
wrong with them goddamn dogs!

2007
02:32:16,307 --> 02:32:17,296
(man grunts)

2008
02:32:18,943 --> 02:32:20,911
(Django) D'Artagnan, motherfuckers!

2009
02:32:21,112 --> 02:32:23,444
- (gunshots)
- (shouting)

2010
02:32:26,217 --> 02:32:27,707
- Hey!
- (grunting)

2011
02:33:00,451 --> 02:33:01,850
(horse whinnying)

2012
02:33:13,898 --> 02:33:15,160
(horse nickering)

2013
02:33:50,568 --> 02:33:51,967
Auf Wiedersehen.

2014
02:34:17,328 --> 02:34:19,922
(galloping hoofbeats)

2015
02:34:22,667 --> 02:34:24,157
(horse whinnying)

2016
02:34:47,592 --> 02:34:49,184
(whimpering)

2017
02:34:52,396 --> 02:34:53,988
(Django) It's me, baby.

2018
02:35:06,143 --> 02:35:07,371
(gasping)

2019
02:35:25,296 --> 02:35:27,890
(spurs clinking)

2020
02:35:42,546 --> 02:35:45,481

- * We will meet by-and-by
- Cora?

2029
02:36:13,577 --> 02:36:15,841
Would you prepare us some coffee?

2030
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:18,141
Sheba, you help her.

2031
02:36:18,282 --> 02:36:19,613
Come on.

2032
02:36:21,585 --> 02:36:24,952
(Stephen) * In the sweet

2033
02:36:25,089 --> 02:36:27,319
(Django) * By-and-by

2034
02:36:27,458 --> 02:36:29,688
* Oh... *

2035
02:36:29,827 --> 02:36:33,558
Oh, y'all gonna be together with Calvin
in the by-and-by, all right.

2036
02:36:39,804 --> 02:36:41,897
Just a bit sooner
than y'all was expectin'.

2037
02:36:46,077 --> 02:36:47,567
(shrieking)

2038
02:36:47,712 --> 02:36:50,510
(screaming)

2039
02:36:50,648 --> 02:36:52,206
Billy Crash.

2040
02:36:52,349 --> 02:36:54,044
- Now, where were we?
- (Billy continues screaming)

2041
02:36:54,185 --> 02:36:56,676
Oh, that's right.

2042
02:36:56,821 --> 02:37:01,224
Last time I seen you,
you had your hands on my...

2043
02:37:01,358 --> 02:37:03,519
(screaming)

2044
02:37:03,661 --> 02:37:06,186
(hysterical shrieking)

2045
02:37:13,804 --> 02:37:17,262
D-jango!
You black son of a bitch!

2046
02:37:17,408 --> 02:37:18,807
The D is silent, hillbilly.

2047
02:37:19,376 --> 02:37:21,241
Oh, no!

2048
02:37:23,247 --> 02:37:26,011
Now, all you black folks,

2049
02:37:26,150 --> 02:37:29,517
I suggest you get away
from all these white folks.

2050
02:37:30,488 --> 02:37:32,149
Not you, Stephen.

2051
02:37:32,690 --> 02:37:34,851
You right where you belong.

2052
02:37:37,228 --> 02:37:41,665
Cora, before you go,
will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?

2053
02:37:41,799 --> 02:37:46,668
- Do what now?
- I said, "Tell Miss Lara goodbye."

2054
02:37:48,272 --> 02:37:50,467
- Bye, Miss Lara.
- (gasps)

2055
02:37:54,245 --> 02:37:55,439
Y'all two run along now.

2056
02:37:55,579 --> 02:37:57,069
(both gasping)

2057
02:38:04,588 --> 02:38:06,146
(door slamming)

2058
02:38:13,964 --> 02:38:18,424
Stephen, how you like my new duds?

2059
02:38:19,436 --> 02:38:21,996
You know, before now I didn't know
that burgundy was my color.

2060
02:38:33,651 --> 02:38:35,585
I count six shots, nigger.

2061
02:38:37,054 --> 02:38:38,885
I count two guns, nigger.

2062
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:44,725
You said in 76 years on this plantation,

2063
02:38:44,862 --> 02:38:47,524
you seen all manner-a shit
done to niggers.

2064
02:38:47,665 --> 02:38:50,691
But I notice,
you didn't mention kneecappin'.

2065
02:38:51,168 --> 02:38:54,365
Oh, God! Motherfucker! Damn it!

2066
02:38:54,505 --> 02:38:56,405
- Seventy-six years, Stephen.
- (Stephen groaning)

2067
02:38:56,540 --> 02:38:58,269
How many niggers you think
you see come and go, huh?

2068
02:38:58,409 --> 02:39:00,001
Seven thousand?

2069
02:39:00,144 --> 02:39:01,873
Eight thousand?

2070
02:39:02,012 --> 02:39:03,775
Nine thousand?

2071
02:39:03,914 --> 02:39:06,712
Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-nine?

2072
02:39:06,851 --> 02:39:09,285
Every single word that came
out of Calvin Candie's mouth

2073
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:10,751
was nothin' but horseshit.

2074
02:39:10,888 --> 02:39:14,790
But he was right about one thing:
I am that one nigger in 10,000.

2075
02:39:14,925 --> 02:39:17,416
(screaming, sobbing)

2076
02:39:17,561 --> 02:39:19,358
You son of a bitch!

2077
02:39:19,496 --> 02:39:22,294
(sobbing) You motherfucker!

2078
02:39:22,433 --> 02:39:24,702
Oh, sweet Jesus,
let me kill this nigger!

2079
02:39:26,303 --> 02:39:29,272
You ain't gonna get away with this,
Django!

2080
02:39:29,406 --> 02:39:31,465
They gonna catch your black ass.

2081
02:39:31,609 --> 02:39:33,907
You gonna be on the
wanted posters now, nigger.

2082
02:39:34,044 --> 02:39:36,911
The bounty hunters
gonna be lookin' for you.

2083
02:39:37,047 --> 02:39:41,347
You can run, nigger,
but they gonna find your ass!

2084
02:39:41,485 --> 02:39:45,421
And when they do, oh, Lord,
what they gonna do to your ass!

2085
02:39:45,556 --> 02:39:48,286
They ain't gonna just kill you, nigger!

2086
02:39:48,425 --> 02:39:50,222
You done fucked up!

2087
02:39:50,361 --> 02:39:52,454
This Candyland, nigger!

2088
02:39:52,596 --> 02:39:55,360
You can't destroy Candyland!

2089
02:39:55,499 --> 02:39:59,128
We been here!
There's always gonna be a Candyland!

2090
02:39:59,904 --> 02:40:00,893
(chuckles)

2091
02:40:02,606 --> 02:40:05,598
(medium-tempo song plays)

2092
02:40:10,147 --> 02:40:13,708
(Stephen) Can't no nigger gunfighter
kill all the white folks in the world!

2093
02:40:13,851 --> 02:40:16,513
They gonna find your black ass!

2094
02:40:16,654 --> 02:40:19,214
(Stephen laughs hysterically)

2095
02:40:21,025 --> 02:40:23,619
Django!

2096
02:40:23,761 --> 02:40:26,127
You uppity son of a...

2097
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:31,759
(horse whinnying)

2098
02:41:00,931 --> 02:41:02,455
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

2099
02:41:03,133 --> 02:41:05,067
Hey, Big Trouble Maker.

2100
02:41:32,396 --> 02:41:36,992
You know what they are going to call
you? "The fastest gun in the South."

2101
02:41:44,641 --> 02:41:46,199
Let's get outta here.

2102
02:41:58,038 --> 02:42:08,283
THE END
