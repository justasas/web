1
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:54,725
Look at this!

2
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:09,807
Hey, look!

3
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:40,971
Voice of the dead.

4
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,951
This is gold.

5
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:33,357
Gold... Gold...

6
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:35,458
Oaks!

7
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:59,451
Get me water...

8
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:03,693
Water...

9
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,480
Gold...

10
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,755
There is gold for everyone.
Down the river...

11
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,990
Come on this side.

12
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:54,078
Better not waste time, boys,
go on and give me a hand.

13
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,676
Let's get this down.

14
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:01,536
It sure is heavy.

15
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:21,899
Man...

16
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,301
This will make life a lot easier
for all of us.

17
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:08,979
The answer to everyone's problems
is gold, and we've got plenty.

18
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:24,160
Secret... in the right moment.
This time we really hit the jackpot.

19
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:29,668
Oaks! Mind if I butt in your conversation
you're having with yourself.

20
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,170
Let me hang onto it...

21
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,866
I want to cross the border, we've got
to be in Mexico before dark.

22
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,909
I was talking to myself because we
have a lot of gold to talk about.

23
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:41,637
We sure do. We've each got
a good share coming.

24
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:45,774
We worked hard for it. What's more,
it's pleasing work.

25
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:50,952
Lot's of gold, lot's of pleasure,
but now it's time to divide it up.

26
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:54,617
I don't feel like dividing.

27
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:03,029
Do you hear that?

28
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:04,994
He says he don't feel like dividing.

29
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:08,931
I can't believe my ears.

30
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:13,110
I'll say it again. I don't feel like dividing.

31
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:17,544
I've come too far, done too much,
to let anyone else touch this gold.

32
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,175
I've had to put up with the
stinkiest skins.

33
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:23,684
I don't divide my gold with no
Motherless Mexicans.

34
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,120
Hands up!

35
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:36,400
What's going on?

36
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,006
Hands up, you two.

37
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:03,722
Don't let him get away.

38
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:05,753
Shoot him down.

39
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:32,014
Tough luck, half-breed.

40
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,853
Guns don't shoot
with no bullets inside.

41
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:14,422
Dig it wide, dig it deep.

42
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:18,334
Hey boys, that's a beautiful grave.
Ain't seen one bigger.

43
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,001
You're gonna be real comfortable.

44
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,301
Ain't that right boss?

45
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,844
We work for you, you're going to kill us
without giving us one drop of tequila.

46
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:36,921
You'll be able to say your prayers
in Spanish, as you lie down to die.

47
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,355
And Gringo won't forbid it.
Have a nice discussion with the devil.

48
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:48,494
How about your half-breed prayers,
in English or Spanish?

49
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:51,326
I don't have to pray for salvation,
after I've been killed.

50
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:55,064
You do, you're a murderer.

51
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:02,337
I'm pleased to call you my friend, since
you're going to give me your gold.

52
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,925
What is he doing? Quick, shoot him.

53
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,204
Don't let him get away!

54
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:37,149
You can't leave without horses.

55
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:41,914
Manchiana, we've got to do something
to stop him. Save the horses.

56
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,457
You won't be going nowhere without
horses, Oaks!

57
00:10:56,903 --> 00:11:00,771
You're scaring the horses away.
Hold your fire.

58
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,852
I must say, you've done a brilliant job.

59
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:09,167
You won't get away with this, Oaks.

60
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,503
Fire!

61
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:24,882
With gold bullets.

62
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,976
It is your gold. The gold you died for.

63
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:32,251
Bullets made of gold are better
than lead. They go deeper.

64
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:37,021
For you who's seen the flame of death,
gold can be useful to burn your killers.

65
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,325
We stay with you, be your companions.

66
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:42,765
But, you tell us the hunting grounds
you've seen...

67
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:44,596
...on the other side of the River of Light.

68
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:47,400
You who have seen
the land of the dead...

69
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:49,771
...must give us the wisdom learned
from the mouths of the great gods.

70
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,936
Each thing you remember,
you must tell us these things.

71
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:57,082
We will serve you and follow you.

72
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:30,377
No, Uncle! No, Daddy!

73
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,691
No, don't. I'll bite you.

74
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,804
Sure don't look like paradise!

75
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,311
Better than the desert though.

76
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:16,321
Don't like the looks of it.
Even God wouldn't stay here.

77
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,754
Where would you suggest we go?

78
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,600
It's hot out here and I need a drink.

79
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:27,097
I'm hungry, fellows, and
when I'm hungry, like I'm hungry...

80
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:30,141
...I'm not scared of a thing.
You can bet your life on it.

81
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,301
He's right. One town is the same
as the next.

82
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,878
There's nothing to be afraid of.

83
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:38,144
Who's afraid? Nobody's a coward.

84
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:41,680
I just said I don't fancy the looks of it.

85
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:44,081
Why don't you shut up!

86
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:46,723
We ain't got no choice.
And I'm hungry, too.

87
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:11,183
You stay here with the horses,
and I mean stay.

88
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,877
You go to the store.

89
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:18,885
You two come with me.

90
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:38,234
Good morning to all you gentlemen.

91
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:43,048
First time in these parts.
Great little town you've got here.

92
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,275
You can see it right away.
It's real friendly here.

93
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:51,818
Are you interested in selling a few
horses? We're heading north.

94
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,859
There's work waiting for us up there.

95
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:56,526
Most of our horses are head up
with accidents.

96
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,498
They kept getting dizzy from the heat!

97
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,732
So, I said, "Get off"...

98
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,902
...so here we are.

99
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,302
Waiting to throw the cards?

100
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:11,807
Here you go. Double pair of aces.

101
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:15,170
I don't see how someone without
a horse can be laughing.

102
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:19,848
Stop throwing darts, Evan!

103
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,118
Ain't no lack of horses down here,
just money.

104
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:33,697
No problem there, mister.

105
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,135
We're in the sails of a lot of money.
We're prepared to pay.

106
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,000
Whisky on the run.

107
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,035
You heard him!

108
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:41,739
The best!

109
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:44,906
From the looks of it,
you had yourself a long walk.

110
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:49,879
It's worth a long walk to find work,
if it pays well.

111
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:54,208
It's real nice to find some people
who work like you, mister.

112
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,352
It's enough to take
one good look at you.

113
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,223
You can see from your expression
you're hard-working and honest.

114
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:05,460
You're all covered in white dust.
I guess you crossed the desert.

115
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:09,658
You took the toughest way to get to
an old, lonely town.

116
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,028
Best thing for you.
Hey, now you can sell your horses.

117
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:18,602
You talk like a businessman.

118
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:23,775
Well, how about it?
We ain't got time to lose.

119
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:26,351
I told you, "Horses cost money here".

120
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:35,758
This is better than money.

121
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:37,885
That's how I'll pay you.

122
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:41,396
How many horses do you need?

123
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,499
Nine.

124
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:45,397
Have you got more of this,
to pay for the rest?

125
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:47,997
Sure!

126
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,935
I'll do my best to get them for you.

127
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,279
Hey, Richie. Why don't you play
some music for our guest?

128
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:03,045
Lori, Lori! What are you waiting for?

129
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:06,283
Come on down. We've got
gentlemen to be entertained.

130
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:07,956
Let them hear one of your songs.

131
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:27,345
- Pretty girl
- Real pretty.

132
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,171
And a real voice, too.

133
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:22,485
Do you want anything else?

134
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,324
No. No, that will do.

135
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,456
Now, let's just see what we've got.

136
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:30,729
It seems you want a lot of things.

137
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,168
Yeah, we've got a mighty long ride
ahead of us.

138
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:35,263
We're heading for the north,
getting work.

139
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:40,311
Beef jerky, sugar, beans, and
2 cases of...

140
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:45,281
And we're going to need at least
10 boxes of carbon cartridges.

141
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:51,515
10 boxes! You wouldn't find that much
to hunt in these parts.

142
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,984
Please excuse me. I won't be long.

143
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:06,461
They're a bandit gang.
You should see the gold they've got.

144
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:14,608
Hurry up, we've got everything.

145
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:17,609
Give me a moment!

146
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:03,360
Don't you get the impression
it's kind of black in here? Unnatural.

147
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:04,723
That's stupid.

148
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:08,929
It's just the desert.
We're used to the sun.

149
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,252
Don't move. You're still weak.

150
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,816
I feel a lot better.

151
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:36,118
I'm stronger than I look.

152
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:39,060
Can't you make this horse get moving?

153
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:42,833
He moves more slowly now
because he's old.

154
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:46,301
How do you ever expect to get there?

155
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:52,838
The men we're following don't have
water and few horses to carry them.

156
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:56,972
They will stop in a small town
on the hill.

157
00:23:58,183 --> 00:23:59,377
How much further is it?

158
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:03,377
Not far. It lies in the next valley,
at the edge of the desert.

159
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:06,486
What's the name of it?

160
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:10,389
I don't know what the White man calls it.

161
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:14,126
The people of the Indian tribes call it
The Unhappy Place.

162
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,399
Hurry, this way.
Follow me. Hurry, come on.

163
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:27,067
- Come on. Can't let them get away!
- Get moving.

164
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:29,641
Go on.

165
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:39,081
Let's go, don't let them get away.
Go! Go!

166
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,860
Watch out!

167
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:57,665
We got him!

168
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:04,871
Very good. Don't let him go. Hold him.

169
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:13,288
Don't let him go!

170
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:14,790
Help!

171
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:23,996
- This way.
- Get him!

172
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:30,630
I got him!

173
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:32,807
A rope!

174
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:36,812
Your days are numbered.

175
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,816
Hang him! Hang him!

176
00:25:42,821 --> 00:25:45,813
- Where do we hang him?
- Over there!

177
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:59,461
He's still alive,
what are you waiting for?

178
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,942
Hold him still, until I get the rope
around his neck.

179
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:13,208
- Get that rope up there.
- Come on.

180
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:19,579
- Killer!
- Your career is over!

181
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:22,091
- Hurry up!
- Take him there, with the others.

182
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:25,057
Take it and show it to him.

183
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:27,420
Do a good job.

184
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,864
You won't be scaring
honest people anymore.

185
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:36,596
God forgive you all.
They'll hang you for this.

186
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:40,878
Are you ready?

187
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:48,541
Let's do it together.

188
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:02,162
There's plenty of spare rope
in this town.

189
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:06,737
Now, you're supposed to be
hanging these men. Get on with it.

190
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:17,745
Stop! That's enough!

191
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:20,578
Look at the blood.
He's dripping like a pig.

192
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:23,313
They're still moving.

193
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:31,727
Thieves, murderers...
there's no salvation for you.

194
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:34,664
Pray for forgiveness to God Almighty.

195
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:43,270
Hey, one's still alive.

196
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:27,941
He's cornered.

197
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:41,127
You'll never get out of that house alive,
Oaks, as long as I'm here.

198
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:17,383
What's wrong with you?

199
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,564
Ain't there someone with
a bit of courage?

200
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:21,928
I offer 500 dollars to the man
who gets him out.

201
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:23,867
Be careful!

202
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:30,265
I killed him!

203
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:38,179
Be careful!

204
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:55,158
What're you doing, stranger?
Do you want to be killed?

205
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:04,170
200 dollars!

206
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,742
My eyes must be playing tricks.

207
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:16,152
Watch it, stranger.

208
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:22,553
It isn't him. It can't be.

209
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:44,840
Who is it?

210
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:46,813
Who is it?

211
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:01,259
Who are you?

212
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:14,238
How did you get here?
I have to know.

213
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:38,000
Go on, fire.
You're all supposed to be dead.

214
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:30,752
Go on, fire.
Come out from behind there.

215
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:58,072
Oh my God! He's full of holes,
but he's still alive!

216
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:08,824
Don't leave him there.
String him up with the rest of them.

217
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:14,695
Wait. What's going on?

218
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:24,741
He has some information I want.
There is plenty of time for hanging.

219
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:28,472
Why wait, Mr. Sorrow? You know
darn well we're going to hang the man.

220
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:29,814
Pancho.

221
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:32,280
Yes sir. What is it, Mr. Sorrow?

222
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:35,547
Get those bullets out of him, and
make sure you bring him to me alive.

223
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,053
Come on, men.
Help me get him out of here.

224
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:48,598
I didn't know pity was
part of your nature.

225
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,167
You know better than that, Oldeman.

226
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:52,529
There are a few things I want to find
out concerning those men.

227
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:55,606
They're a bunch of killers,
murdering outlaws.

228
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:57,334
We felt that's what had to be done.

229
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:59,740
But you don't know what I heard.

230
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:01,243
They couldn't hide much from me.

231
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:03,006
We got them into justice.

232
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:09,445
You can have all the justice you like.

233
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,216
I've got to know something...
something more important.

234
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:15,918
Come on? I've got a little talking and
a little listening to do.

235
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:18,593
Who have you chosen, Mr. Sorrow?
We can help.

236
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:23,064
Now, let's see what miracle
that bunch can perform.

237
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,065
We want to know something.

238
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:06,698
Are you going to stay here or
are you going to move on?

239
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:10,733
I guess I'll stay.

240
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,545
Take this. Make him drink.

241
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:20,311
Drink this, it's good for your hair.

242
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:23,854
Pancho, you have to save him.
He won't do me any good as a corpse.

243
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:25,514
I'll do my best, sir.

244
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:28,018
Go on. Do the surgery.

245
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:43,030
Enough with your screaming.
This is nothing! Keep going, Pancho.

246
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:47,404
We'll get him back on his feet again...

247
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:53,540
...and he'll be glad to tell us
his life story.

248
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:58,013
A horrible story about
crimes and priests.

249
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:01,055
I don't want to hear it,
I'm leaving.

250
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:06,156
But I love to hear people's stories.
I'll listen eagerly.

251
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:09,597
I hope we honorable citizens
turn out to be...

252
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:12,397
...better than that lying criminal.

253
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:14,529
No, I'll have my usual raspberry syrup.

254
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:25,845
Good, Pancho!
You caught it!

255
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,042
He's as good as a doctor.

256
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:29,077
This is gold!

257
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:30,484
- Gold?
- Gold!

258
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:32,890
- Gold!
- Get it!!

259
00:38:34,392 --> 00:38:36,587
Stop it! What's going on?
Get back! I said, get back!

260
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,963
What have you done, you idiot!
You killed him?

261
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,404
I'm sorry, all my life I've been searching
for gold, and this man is full of it.

262
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:56,871
This bullet is solid gold.

263
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,680
I don't like the kind of games
you're playing.

264
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:03,447
It's no game.

265
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:09,590
Gold is a sure way to kill a man.

266
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:11,959
It's a game, all right...

267
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:14,861
...and I'd say a very expensive one
for a gunman.

268
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:16,999
30 dollars a shot.

269
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:19,296
It sure was an investment.

270
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:24,435
You're going to give me
those 500 dollars, ain't ya'?

271
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:27,443
Ah, you're going to pay 500 dollars.

272
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:29,641
Since when did he get so generous?

273
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:31,715
It isn't for me.
It is for the public good.

274
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:34,649
It is worth paying any price for justice.

275
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,854
I wouldn't count on seeing that
money, stranger, if I were you.

276
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:40,749
It's only gold, isn't it!

277
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,954
All right, stranger, here is your
500 dollars.

278
00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:46,030
That's why you came here...
to collect!

279
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,658
Well, all right. I need a bed.

280
00:39:52,837 --> 00:39:55,806
Pay me tomorrow.
No need to hurry.

281
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:07,982
Have you got a room for me, boy?

282
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:09,485
Yes, sir. Right away.

283
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:16,686
He seems to come from far away,
like every drifter.

284
00:40:18,663 --> 00:40:20,528
What do we do with this?

285
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:25,602
Listen to me, Templer.

286
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:28,604
Nobody in this place
gets away with anything.

287
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,609
You were in too much of a hurry
to hang these guys.

288
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,610
The young stranger helped you out.

289
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:36,703
Now, this one's dead,
and no one can talk.

290
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,839
These outlaws were too dangerous.

291
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,178
No point in waiting to kill them.

292
00:40:40,618 --> 00:40:42,950
I don't care about those gringos...

293
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:44,646
...only about what they had...

294
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:48,087
...a whole lot of gold.
That is what I'm talking about.

295
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:52,490
A saddle full of gold,
not those gold bullets.

296
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,391
Go and get it and bring it to me.

297
00:40:58,035 --> 00:40:59,969
I don't know what they've been
telling you...

298
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:01,936
...but if there was any of it,
someone has escaped with it.

299
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:06,235
I'll keep my cowboys wide awake,
as if this were my own land...

300
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:10,781
...and nobody gets through without
me hearing about it.

301
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,112
Oldeman here is wicked.
Ain't you?

302
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:17,210
It's not me, but the Lord in heaven
will show us the way.

303
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:22,650
I'll find it, whatever it is.
Don't you worry about that.

304
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,524
Come on, boys, let's go.

305
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,817
Look, here it is.

306
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,679
Just like I said.
He signs his name with a cross.

307
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:00,483
I don't understand why
you didn't give him the money.

308
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,582
He didn't want it.
He just wanted to sleep here.

309
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:05,184
Listen.

310
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,194
Sleeping is very good.

311
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:16,764
He isn't going to get the chance
to sleep late.

312
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:19,104
Tomorrow, he can take his dollars
and get out.

313
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:23,507
I should have known you would give
him the money. You saved it for him.

314
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:25,775
What about all the things we planned
together?

315
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,509
Don't worry about that.

316
00:43:28,052 --> 00:43:30,077
Finally, you'll marry me?

317
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:32,212
I don't like being just "your woman".

318
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:34,017
Sure, Lori, I'll marry you.

319
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,440
You mean it?

320
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:55,342
Sure! We're getting married
as soon as we can.

321
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:59,541
Listen. That man just stopped walking.

322
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:09,320
Be fair. I earned at least
twice your cut.

323
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:10,621
You must be crazy, Templer.

324
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:12,218
I was the one who found it.

325
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:15,263
How would you have hid it,
if I hadn't helped you?

326
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:16,731
I could have gotten someone else.

327
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:19,494
Is that so! Who lent you money
all these years...

328
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,036
...that you never paid back?

329
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:22,271
Listen, Oldeman...

330
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:25,774
...I've made investments that will be
useful for the whole community.

331
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:27,535
It is your money,
but what did you do with it?

332
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:31,508
I spent it building this town,
making it prosperous.

333
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:34,446
I've paid my interest, and plenty of it.

334
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,049
No man can say
I was anything but honest.

335
00:44:37,555 --> 00:44:40,388
I've always defended the morals
of the folks here.

336
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:44,426
I was never afraid to teach justice
and the fear of God.

337
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:47,187
I taught half of them how to pray.

338
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:51,959
Now, we must divide this gold,
splitting it equally...

339
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,463
...or do you want to cause trouble
and attract Sorrow's attention?

340
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,505
That's your kind of justice, Oldeman.

341
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:01,701
That's just what I expected from you,
swindler.

342
00:45:02,146 --> 00:45:04,546
You can't fool me,
you low-down chiseler.

343
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:06,546
Keep your voice down.

344
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,708
This is not enough!

345
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:13,787
It ain't all yours. This gold is going to
be divided equally.

346
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:15,547
We'll see about that!

347
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:27,935
Are you threatening me?

348
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:34,103
- You're not going anywhere with that!
- You can't stop me taking my share.

349
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:37,679
- We've already decided what's fair.
- That's mine. I want my fair share.

350
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:40,783
Either I get my share
or I'm taking all of it.

351
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:11,074
Who's there?

352
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:15,072
Mind if I speak with you, sir?

353
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:16,468
What do you want?

354
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:21,009
I want to ask a favor of you.

355
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,412
You woke me up.

356
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:28,652
Is it very late?

357
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:29,781
Yes, it is, sir.

358
00:47:32,763 --> 00:47:36,494
Well, what do you want?
Speak up.

359
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:39,700
I want you to take me with you.

360
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:44,571
With me? Where to?

361
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:46,675
Anywhere.

362
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:55,844
That just reminded me.
I have to go somewhere, myself.

363
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,816
You're a brave man...
braver than anyone here.

364
00:48:02,927 --> 00:48:03,916
Take me with you, sir.

365
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:06,487
Being brave is not important.

366
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:10,893
Why do you want to leave?

367
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:13,265
It's awful to be in this wicked town.

368
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,837
I won't spent another night here!

369
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:16,930
There must be a better place
in this world!

370
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:20,442
Yeah, I've seen better places, boy.

371
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:23,071
So, you will take me with you?

372
00:48:23,814 --> 00:48:30,583
I'm not leaving. I'm staying right here.
You better make other plans.

373
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:34,513
What's your name, boy?

374
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,749
Evan!

375
00:48:38,862 --> 00:48:39,851
Evan!

376
00:48:44,602 --> 00:48:45,569
Evan!

377
00:48:58,015 --> 00:48:59,607
Evan! Evan!

378
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:03,186
What's going on?

379
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,117
Look at what Evan did to
my beautiful clothing.

380
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:07,916
All the beautiful things
you brought from Denver.

381
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,224
You're son is a monster.

382
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:13,658
He'll be hanging from a tree like
one of those dirty bandits out there.

383
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:15,629
Calm down. I'll buy you other clothing.

384
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:18,327
Not even if you're dead.
You know the same thing would happen.

385
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:21,199
I wish you wouldn't blame him.
You know it isn't his fault.

386
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:23,966
Not his fault?
How about when he hit me?

387
00:49:24,074 --> 00:49:25,541
Calm yourself. I'll punish him.

388
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:27,007
Evan. Evan...

389
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:32,538
Evan, come here.

390
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:56,771
Help me cut them down!

391
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:04,573
We'll help you do your duty.
In this village full of outlaws...

392
00:50:05,683 --> 00:50:06,911
...they have to go free.

393
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:10,678
They have the entire night to get away.

394
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:14,322
The desert cools down at sunset
and the nights are cold.

395
00:51:16,987 --> 00:51:18,352
Now, will you tell us?

396
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:21,155
Tell you what?

397
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:22,848
What is death like?

398
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,396
We heard there are
many wild beasts to hunt.

399
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:29,991
We heard the pastures are
full of white buffalo...

400
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,692
...the land is green and fertile.

401
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:38,371
Hey you! Who told you to cut
those men down?

402
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:41,610
We want those outlaw killers
to hang there...

403
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,381
...to remind strangers not to even
attempt to break the law.

404
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:51,284
You'd be warned by that, right?

405
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:55,985
Did you hear that!
Be careful, so nothing happens to you.

406
00:51:56,093 --> 00:52:00,223
Take this advice, stranger.

407
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:04,865
Here's your 500 dollars. Take it.

408
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:09,497
Now, get out of town. Around here,
we don't like folks we don't know.

409
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:13,033
Make it easy on yourself, stranger.
Get out, while you still can.

410
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:18,614
Everybody here is a family man,
and we want to keep it that way.

411
00:52:19,082 --> 00:52:22,574
- So you have to go!
- We're talking to you!

412
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:32,988
My friend, you see there are problems.
You're even helping them!

413
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:35,558
Are you in need of a horse?

414
00:52:44,499 --> 00:52:47,525
Run, run!

415
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:54,831
Get it!

416
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:48,787
No, no. Let me go, please.

417
00:53:48,997 --> 00:53:50,521
Hold him tight!

418
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:53,733
Hold him tight!

419
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:04,277
Hold the boy!

420
00:54:04,546 --> 00:54:07,481
- Shit!
- Stop him!

421
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,213
Leave him alone.

422
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:18,024
Hey, stranger, get over here.

423
00:54:21,596 --> 00:54:25,054
Don't you know it's dangerous to put
your nose in other peoples' business?

424
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:29,431
It looked like fun, so I joined in.

425
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:31,769
Fun is just what they were having.

426
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:36,266
He was just invited to a party,
and he's the guest of honor.

427
00:54:36,611 --> 00:54:38,408
It'll be a family party.

428
00:54:38,913 --> 00:54:41,313
He doesn't look anxious to
go to your party.

429
00:54:43,451 --> 00:54:45,715
That's exactly the reason
why we invited him.

430
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:48,221
Why don't you come, too?
I like the tip of your trigger finger.

431
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:51,384
Isn't it a pity that every time you shoot
a man, you're wasting gold?

432
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,153
Don't you save it for special occasions?

433
00:54:53,928 --> 00:54:55,725
Listen, I've got a proposal for you.

434
00:54:56,564 --> 00:55:00,830
On my ranch, I have living quarters
for a man like you.

435
00:55:01,302 --> 00:55:02,291
Come work for me.

436
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:06,872
Maybe. It depends on what work
you need done.

437
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:10,344
Tie him up tight!

438
00:55:11,046 --> 00:55:13,344
Don't be afraid that you'll hurt him.

439
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:15,809
- Pedro!
- Yes, boss.

440
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:19,716
Take one of my fastest horses and
visit his father.

441
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:24,517
Tell him we want all the gold he found
on the outlaws they hung...

442
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:26,526
...or we'll kill his son.

443
00:55:26,728 --> 00:55:29,094
Also tell him I want all of it soon.

444
00:55:29,397 --> 00:55:32,924
I'm anxious to close this deal.

445
00:55:33,101 --> 00:55:34,728
Sure thing, boss. Right away.

446
00:55:35,003 --> 00:55:37,471
Boys, there will be gold for all of you.

447
00:55:43,011 --> 00:55:45,036
What are your thoughts, my friend?

448
00:55:45,346 --> 00:55:48,679
I myself believe fathers have a
strong love for their sons.

449
00:55:49,117 --> 00:55:53,417
While we're all waiting, let's entertain
our handsome, young guest.

450
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:59,653
Guarnito! Hurry! We're waiting to
begin the party.

451
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:17,303
Why not sit down? Go on, sit there.

452
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:20,044
Make yourself at home, next to me.

453
00:56:22,183 --> 00:56:24,617
Don't my boys have a good time here?

454
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:27,085
Why don't you join in the fun?

455
00:56:37,065 --> 00:56:38,828
Come on. Drink up. Eat something.

456
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,128
Before you know it, you'll feel
like one of us.

457
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,330
The place, the food, and the drink
satisfy man's basic needs...

458
00:56:44,472 --> 00:56:47,930
...and even more refined sensations,
like crying, for instance.

459
00:56:48,076 --> 00:56:49,907
This doesn't seem right.

460
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:53,373
You, holding the kid hostage.

461
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:56,041
I didn't know you were a model citizen.

462
00:56:57,919 --> 00:57:00,444
Come on, you must have broken the
law at some time in your life.

463
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:03,216
You handle a gun noticeably well,
stranger.

464
00:57:06,694 --> 00:57:09,629
Yeah. I have good reason to practice.

465
00:57:10,098 --> 00:57:14,831
It is unlikely you got all that practice
being an honest, law abiding man.

466
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:18,132
You'll enjoy being
a member of my gang.

467
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:20,374
It should be quite obvious.

468
00:57:21,709 --> 00:57:25,201
Mirami, my boys are hard workers...

469
00:57:25,346 --> 00:57:29,009
...so I give them the best of everything.

470
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:31,109
See for yourself.

471
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:34,178
I taught them well, to enjoy good things.

472
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:12,025
If I have to pay the ransom
for my son's life...

473
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:13,093
...you should help, too.

474
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:14,217
Why should I?

475
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:17,856
He's your son.
You pay with your share of the gold.

476
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:21,301
We're partners.
We share the same secret.

477
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:22,528
You pay your ransom, not me.

478
00:58:22,637 --> 00:58:24,298
My share is not enough.
They'll kill him.

479
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:27,831
Don't you see they're determined
to get all of the gold back?

480
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:31,172
Not my share. That stays with me.

481
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:33,976
The kid is not my responsibility.

482
00:58:34,382 --> 00:58:35,781
I thought you were my partner.

483
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:38,909
I am your partner, Templer, but
the boy is yours.

484
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,078
My God, you're scum.

485
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,246
Let me go or I'll shoot.

486
00:58:45,093 --> 00:58:46,219
I'll make you pay.

487
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:57,499
Where are you? Can't you make up
your mind quickly about the gold?

488
00:58:57,872 --> 00:58:59,396
Take it easy, there.

489
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:04,972
Help yourself as much as you want.

490
00:59:06,214 --> 00:59:11,117
Tell them they've got 5 minutes
to make up their lousy minds.

491
00:59:17,692 --> 00:59:19,091
- Did he agree?
- No.

492
00:59:19,227 --> 00:59:20,159
He wouldn't give it to you?

493
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:21,853
No. I couldn't make him understand.

494
00:59:21,963 --> 00:59:24,056
That was our chance to
get our hands on all of it.

495
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:25,496
You mean, to sacrifice my son?

496
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:30,234
Can't you see it's only a bluff?
They're just trying to scare you...

497
00:59:30,405 --> 00:59:31,633
I'm not going to take that risk.

498
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:34,105
The trouble is, you're weak as water.

499
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,802
You'd be a fool, telling them you've
managed to get all the gold.

500
00:59:36,911 --> 00:59:37,935
Deny it! Deny it!

501
00:59:38,046 --> 00:59:40,037
Make them think you don't have it.

502
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:49,578
Here he comes.

503
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:56,954
It's no good. He says he doesn't
have the gold.

504
00:59:57,265 --> 01:00:01,224
He asked you to let the boy go.

505
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:05,667
I have a job for you, stranger.

506
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:10,977
Carry this kid's corpse
back to his father.

507
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:13,907
Max! You know what to do.

508
01:00:17,118 --> 01:00:18,085
Wait a minute.

509
01:00:20,288 --> 01:00:22,654
I have an idea how
he can be of use to us.

510
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,893
I'll get your gold.

511
01:00:27,128 --> 01:00:29,096
You want to save the boy,
don't you?

512
01:00:29,797 --> 01:00:31,025
Guess I'm getting old.

513
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:34,294
All right.

514
01:00:39,107 --> 01:00:41,234
You must first shoot
that rope there...

515
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,772
...the one that ties him to the wall.

516
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:49,906
I know you're an excellent shot,
so it should be easy for you.

517
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,089
But not so easy after
drinking the rest of this whisky.

518
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:56,812
How about that?

519
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,514
I want to see if you're a good drinker.

520
01:01:23,584 --> 01:01:25,711
He can get drunk.

521
01:01:26,254 --> 01:01:31,624
Silence! Drinking is like playing.
You need concentration.

522
01:01:57,452 --> 01:02:02,389
Now we'll see what kind of
man you really are.

523
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:09,251
Pablo.

524
01:02:49,103 --> 01:02:50,092
Stop.

525
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:51,660
I'll handle this.

526
01:02:55,843 --> 01:02:58,744
Very smart.
You surprised me, friend.

527
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:01,405
Very smart.

528
01:03:02,216 --> 01:03:05,777
But you should know better...
The boy is still tied up.

529
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,178
I'll give him to you anyway.

530
01:03:09,123 --> 01:03:10,181
Cut that cord!

531
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:15,824
Hurry up! His life has been saved.

532
01:03:17,198 --> 01:03:20,725
Cheer up, boy, if you want to
please your father.

533
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:22,733
You should start praying for death...

534
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:26,101
...because now your life is worth less
than the gold or the sand in the desert.

535
01:03:27,308 --> 01:03:30,243
What's this? A funeral?
Get on with the party.

536
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:11,271
Who fired a gun?

537
01:06:11,372 --> 01:06:15,934
- I don't know.
- It was a gunshot.

538
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,739
- Where did the shot come from?
- From the stable.

539
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:29,781
What happened? It was an accident.

540
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:30,982
He was playing with my gun.

541
01:06:32,893 --> 01:06:34,292
He was looking for trouble.

542
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:38,226
I know how you must feel, stranger,
after you did your best to save him.

543
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,027
He didn't want to be a man.

544
01:06:40,134 --> 01:06:40,998
What do you mean?

545
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:42,997
A man must take on responsibility.

546
01:06:43,604 --> 01:06:47,301
A man does what he must do,
and accepts the consequences.

547
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:49,804
I'd say he died like a man.

548
01:06:50,678 --> 01:06:53,340
My offer is still open to you,
if you want to accept it.

549
01:06:54,382 --> 01:06:58,250
Take him back to town, to his father,
and get all the gold he's hidden.

550
01:06:58,452 --> 01:07:00,443
If he doesn't cooperate,
he'll have visitors.

551
01:07:01,155 --> 01:07:03,680
I'll go, but I don't think
it will do any good now.

552
01:07:03,824 --> 01:07:05,485
I think it depends on you.

553
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:06,660
Pablo, saddle up that horse.

554
01:07:07,628 --> 01:07:09,721
- You see anyone?
- Not yet.

555
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:12,296
Why don't they come?

556
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:41,495
What is it?

557
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,721
The stranger is bringing him in now.

558
01:07:44,932 --> 01:07:46,160
What happened? How is he?

559
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:49,896
You better prepare yourself,
Templer. It doesn't look good.

560
01:07:52,173 --> 01:07:53,538
Here they are.

561
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,633
Come on, take him.

562
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:44,620
Take him.

563
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:47,115
Help me with him.

564
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:00,364
Come on, move away from the table.

565
01:09:24,932 --> 01:09:26,923
My poor boy, what did they do?

566
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,500
Are you mad?

567
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:32,602
He was disgusted of a father like you.

568
01:09:33,107 --> 01:09:34,665
Hold him.

569
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:51,452
What's wrong with him?

570
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:52,492
He must be out of his mind...

571
01:09:52,626 --> 01:09:55,959
...to have no respect for the feelings
of a father for his son.

572
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:58,163
Kick him out of here, once and for all.

573
01:10:16,951 --> 01:10:18,919
You'd better give up that gold, Templer.

574
01:10:23,824 --> 01:10:25,291
Or they'll come and get you.

575
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:37,200
Are you going to just let him
walk out of here?

576
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:43,871
No, not now.
There is too much wickedness.

577
01:11:02,363 --> 01:11:06,595
They don't know you still have
many gold bullets in your gun.

578
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:08,959
Son, you must have a lot of faith.

579
01:11:09,103 --> 01:11:12,038
When you finish all your bullets,
you must leave.

580
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,270
We have a common enemy.

581
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:50,701
You know who I mean.

582
01:11:55,349 --> 01:11:57,613
You must be very careful
of a man like Templer.

583
01:11:57,718 --> 01:12:01,950
He has always threatened me with
violence.

584
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:07,484
He's come into my house,
where I live.

585
01:12:09,129 --> 01:12:13,190
I didn't think any house in this town
would welcome a guest.

586
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:17,563
Mine's different. If a stranger comes to
my door, tired and hungry...

587
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,434
...he's always welcome.

588
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:22,165
Come on, stranger.

589
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,237
Why are you so generous?

590
01:12:29,983 --> 01:12:32,918
Because I'm scared.
I've been threatened.

591
01:12:33,754 --> 01:12:36,814
You can protect us.
I must have protection.

592
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:38,385
I'll pay you.

593
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:29,705
I do everything myself.
I don't have any servants.

594
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,938
I don't trust them. They steal and,
there are too many nice things here.

595
01:13:33,046 --> 01:13:35,037
Eat up. I'm sure you're hungry.

596
01:13:38,285 --> 01:13:42,187
You'll get special treatment,
if you'll just stay here.

597
01:13:42,289 --> 01:13:46,248
You won't believe this,
but I treat everybody specially.

598
01:13:46,693 --> 01:13:50,254
An honest person can't sleep well
in this town.

599
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:55,900
Are you afraid to live alone?

600
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:00,129
Yes, I am afraid...

601
01:14:00,374 --> 01:14:02,069
...and I've been unfortunate.

602
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,969
I saw a woman up in that window.

603
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:08,476
You've already seen her?
She's my wife.

604
01:14:09,016 --> 01:14:10,574
But she might as well not exist.

605
01:14:11,985 --> 01:14:15,614
She's unbalanced.
The girl is insane.

606
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:18,519
I had to lock her up in her room,
poor creature.

607
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:23,328
She wouldn't harm anyone.
She has the mind of a child.

608
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,364
If anything happened to me...

609
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:27,695
...Sorrow's men would come around.

610
01:14:29,369 --> 01:14:33,999
What if Templer came here. A man with
no religious principles or morals.

611
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:38,940
That's why the Lord struck down
his son.

612
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:42,038
He lives with that woman openly
and they're not married.

613
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:45,512
Everybody talks about that scandal.

614
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:51,352
Please say you'll protect us.

615
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:58,830
I want to go out.

616
01:15:04,972 --> 01:15:08,373
She always does it.

617
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:17,875
She is always like this.
There is nothing I can do.

618
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,795
We better find that stranger
and kill him before it gets dark.

619
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,861
And see about those 2 Indian men.

620
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:41,100
We have a fine reason to beat them.

621
01:15:41,341 --> 01:15:45,175
Do whatever you want, but be sure
he's as dead as a doornail tomorrow.

622
01:15:45,746 --> 01:15:47,771
All right, boss, leave it to me.

623
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:50,975
It's a good bed...

624
01:15:55,555 --> 01:15:58,046
But you don't want to fall asleep.

625
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,194
What's that?

626
01:16:07,134 --> 01:16:09,261
Like this, don't turn it out.

627
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,163
I want you to rest, but stay awake.

628
01:16:13,273 --> 01:16:16,640
I'm exhausted.
You can't stop me from sleeping.

629
01:16:22,582 --> 01:16:25,380
I'm getting up early and hitting the road.
Good night.

630
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:30,245
I said, "Good night!"

631
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:56,566
I knew I'd find you in here.

632
01:17:57,444 --> 01:18:00,106
I heard voices and somebody
moving about.

633
01:18:00,647 --> 01:18:01,875
Don't you recognize me?

634
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:04,647
Sure. I saw you in the window.

635
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:10,183
You didn't understand the signs
I was making to you.

636
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,020
What were you trying to tell me?

637
01:18:13,226 --> 01:18:15,285
To get out of here. You're in danger.

638
01:18:15,629 --> 01:18:17,153
You don't know what
people are like here.

639
01:18:17,264 --> 01:18:19,027
You're different from them.

640
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:22,324
You must not stay here.
I've got to save you.

641
01:18:24,504 --> 01:18:25,937
Why do you think I'm in danger?

642
01:18:26,106 --> 01:18:28,199
They are trying to murder you.

643
01:18:28,308 --> 01:18:32,210
Life in this place is worth nothing.
Look at me.

644
01:18:40,787 --> 01:18:41,879
What's your name?

645
01:18:42,522 --> 01:18:43,511
Elizabeth.

646
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:52,054
Your husband says you are crazy.

647
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:53,099
He's evil.

648
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,993
He wants me to think I'm mad.
He nearly succeeded.

649
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:01,366
Why does he want to do that?

650
01:19:05,078 --> 01:19:07,069
Because I fell in love with someone...

651
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:12,047
I've been locked up ever since.

652
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:14,978
Then you're not really mad.

653
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:16,616
I don't know.

654
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:20,320
What's the matter?

655
01:19:21,795 --> 01:19:25,526
It's just...
There must be someone to love me.

656
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:44,876
He left your door unlocked?
Why did he do that?

657
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:49,316
Because he wants me to make sure
you stay to defend his house.

658
01:19:50,924 --> 01:19:51,913
Where's the gun?

659
01:20:27,627 --> 01:20:32,030
Get out of here while there is time.

660
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:36,964
You haven't kissed me yet.

661
01:20:51,651 --> 01:20:54,415
My love! My love!

662
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:28,446
What's going on?

663
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:31,015
It's Sorrow's men!

664
01:21:31,157 --> 01:21:34,058
Arm yourself. Wait at the window.
But don't shoot!

665
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:44,401
Templer, open up.

666
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:46,672
We've got to do something.
Hide the gold.

667
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:49,502
- I know where to hide it.
- Where?

668
01:21:51,778 --> 01:21:54,178
Templer, you can't stop us.
Do you hear?

669
01:21:54,547 --> 01:21:58,108
We're not playing around.
We're coming in.

670
01:21:58,652 --> 01:22:02,645
All right boys, break the door.

671
01:22:05,592 --> 01:22:07,423
You take care of the horses...

672
01:22:07,827 --> 01:22:13,424
...the rest of you get up there
and break that door down.

673
01:22:21,408 --> 01:22:22,568
Go for it!

674
01:22:56,476 --> 01:22:58,273
Have you no respect for the dead?!

675
01:22:58,845 --> 01:23:01,541
The saloon is closed.
We're in mourning here.

676
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,018
Listen to that,
anybody will think it's true.

677
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:12,883
You know what to do.
Cover every corner of the house.

678
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:15,321
Templer, either you tell us
where you hid it...

679
01:24:15,622 --> 01:24:16,782
...or we're going to kill you.

680
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:20,018
You've searched this place from
top to bottom.

681
01:24:20,126 --> 01:24:22,822
You see, the gold ain't here.

682
01:24:23,029 --> 01:24:27,125
It's been taken by that dirty rat,
Oldeman. You'll find it at his house.

683
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:29,893
If you're lying, watch out.

684
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,802
Quick! They're here. Save me.

685
01:24:33,873 --> 01:24:35,135
Look, they're here!

686
01:24:35,308 --> 01:24:37,242
No! Get away from the window.

687
01:24:37,677 --> 01:24:42,205
Do something. That's why you're here...
to protect me.

688
01:24:46,085 --> 01:24:49,054
Am I suppose to protect
your house...

689
01:24:49,389 --> 01:24:52,085
...your reputation or your wife?

690
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:54,216
Do you have anything of greater value?

691
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:05,894
There is light over there.

692
01:25:06,005 --> 01:25:07,939
We'll have fun.

693
01:25:08,074 --> 01:25:10,838
The house is this one.

694
01:25:12,278 --> 01:25:15,372
Oldeman! Oldeman!

695
01:25:16,449 --> 01:25:18,940
We're coming for the gold.

696
01:25:19,118 --> 01:25:21,643
Here it is. Take it. Give it to them,
before they harm you.

697
01:25:21,754 --> 01:25:23,221
You're mad.

698
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:26,614
Leave her alone.

699
01:25:32,632 --> 01:25:35,396
Come on, Oldeman, open up!

700
01:25:36,369 --> 01:25:37,961
We don't like waiting.

701
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:39,836
Open!

702
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:50,882
- Somebody is there.
- Open the door.

703
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:53,885
Give us the gold!
Don't waste our time.

704
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:57,150
He's not him, Willy.

705
01:25:58,191 --> 01:26:00,682
It's the gold!

706
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,186
It's the stranger! Kill him.

707
01:26:30,523 --> 01:26:35,187
Get the horses and let's go.

708
01:26:50,476 --> 01:26:53,877
Don't be afraid. It's all over.

709
01:27:15,201 --> 01:27:19,661
She betrayed me...
a servant in my house...

710
01:27:19,806 --> 01:27:22,104
...no better than that.
Damn that half-breed.

711
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,539
I'll show them both...

712
01:27:23,676 --> 01:27:26,304
...together they'll know who I am.

713
01:28:57,837 --> 01:29:00,965
I know I can't help you.
You should try to forget it.

714
01:29:02,675 --> 01:29:07,203
Don't be so sad. You know I love you.
I'm sure I can help.

715
01:29:12,685 --> 01:29:14,312
I can't love you.

716
01:29:16,322 --> 01:29:18,722
I've got to finish what I've started.

717
01:29:19,826 --> 01:29:20,918
I know.

718
01:29:21,828 --> 01:29:24,092
I've always known
that would be your answer.

719
01:29:24,897 --> 01:29:26,262
You'd leave me.

720
01:29:30,002 --> 01:29:30,991
Where is my gun?

721
01:29:45,218 --> 01:29:49,450
I have given you the power to
walk upon serpents and scorpions...

722
01:29:49,555 --> 01:29:53,423
...to withstand the light of adversary,
whoever they may be.

723
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:58,194
If who so ever among you say,
"I shall be great", shall be small.

724
01:29:58,531 --> 01:30:02,968
Who so ever shall say,
"I shall be first", shall be last.

725
01:30:03,236 --> 01:30:07,536
For the son of God came
among you, not to be served...

726
01:30:07,807 --> 01:30:09,206
...but to serve you.

727
01:30:09,842 --> 01:30:14,370
He gave his life so that you may live.
Amen.

728
01:32:02,655 --> 01:32:04,282
What a day!

729
01:32:08,261 --> 01:32:09,785
Give me a drink.

730
01:32:49,568 --> 01:32:52,901
Rotten thief, now you know what
it costs to double-cross me.

731
01:32:53,139 --> 01:32:55,232
That will fix you and him
at the same time.

732
01:32:59,278 --> 01:33:02,042
He must have taken it
while we were sleeping.

733
01:33:02,248 --> 01:33:03,442
I want to know why.

734
01:33:05,918 --> 01:33:07,044
I better go find him.

735
01:33:07,586 --> 01:33:12,546
What are you going to do when the
others come back to get the gold?

736
01:33:12,658 --> 01:33:13,716
If you want, I'll stay.

737
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:16,853
No, they'll kill you.

738
01:33:39,885 --> 01:33:41,250
Don't worry.

739
01:33:42,955 --> 01:33:46,618
Go now, and some day
come back for me.

740
01:33:47,626 --> 01:33:49,924
If you don't, I shall die.

741
01:33:53,799 --> 01:33:56,666
- Sure filled him full of holes.
- A good job.

742
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:01,964
Left his gun behind.

743
01:34:02,742 --> 01:34:04,039
The chamber is empty.

744
01:34:04,276 --> 01:34:06,039
I know this gun. I'm sure I do.

745
01:34:06,145 --> 01:34:10,980
Hey! Wait a minute.
This bullet is solid gold.

746
01:34:12,752 --> 01:34:17,348
It's the stranger! He murdered Templer.

747
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:20,887
Go and get him.
What are you waiting for?

748
01:34:21,093 --> 01:34:23,061
Lori. Where the devil is Lori?

749
01:34:23,129 --> 01:34:25,063
I haven't seen her.
She's a bad woman.

750
01:34:25,331 --> 01:34:29,597
I'm sure she's got
something to do with this.

751
01:34:29,869 --> 01:34:31,234
Better get going.
Take your guns.

752
01:34:31,337 --> 01:34:32,599
Yes, let's go. Come on!

753
01:34:43,816 --> 01:34:45,909
Hey, mister. Hey, you!

754
01:34:47,186 --> 01:34:48,414
Come here.

755
01:34:55,694 --> 01:34:58,288
Listen, I'm terrified.
I want you to help me.

756
01:34:58,397 --> 01:34:59,989
They're going to kill me.

757
01:35:00,099 --> 01:35:02,761
Oldeman has killed Templer.
It was awful.

758
01:35:02,868 --> 01:35:06,964
I managed to get away. I saw him do it.
I saw him kill Templer.

759
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:10,199
Where did he do it?

760
01:35:10,342 --> 01:35:13,243
In the saloon.
We just came from the funeral.

761
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,913
Now he wants to kill me.

762
01:35:16,015 --> 01:35:18,040
I'm in danger because I saw him do it.

763
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:21,012
I don't stand a chance in hell
against Oldeman.

764
01:35:21,353 --> 01:35:23,014
He's a highly respected citizen.

765
01:35:23,322 --> 01:35:25,552
He can kill me and
make it look perfectly legal.

766
01:35:29,862 --> 01:35:31,727
Would you like to be rich?

767
01:35:35,634 --> 01:35:37,033
What do you mean by that?

768
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:42,436
Exactly what do you want me to do?

769
01:35:43,209 --> 01:35:46,610
I know where he hid
all of Templer's gold.

770
01:35:46,912 --> 01:35:49,346
If you help me get it, we'll split it.

771
01:35:50,683 --> 01:35:51,672
Where is it?

772
01:35:51,784 --> 01:35:54,116
At the cemetery. In Evan's coffin.

773
01:35:54,553 --> 01:35:56,953
I don't have the courage to
get it myself...

774
01:35:57,089 --> 01:36:00,684
...but there is enough gold down
there to do things that...

775
01:36:00,793 --> 01:36:04,160
Listen here. If anyone tries to
open that boy's coffin...

776
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:06,421
...I'll make sure he's shot.

777
01:36:06,599 --> 01:36:09,727
Haven't you done enough?

778
01:36:10,136 --> 01:36:11,694
That gold belongs to Evan.

779
01:36:12,104 --> 01:36:13,935
But we need it to leave this place.

780
01:36:14,773 --> 01:36:17,765
We've got to get out of here
before they kill us.

781
01:36:18,144 --> 01:36:20,169
Your life is in danger as well as mine.

782
01:36:37,463 --> 01:36:38,794
What do you think of this baby?

783
01:36:46,305 --> 01:36:47,863
All right, are you ready? Let's go.

784
01:36:47,973 --> 01:36:49,167
Come on, hurry up!

785
01:36:50,142 --> 01:36:52,269
Now we'll see some action.

786
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:55,903
You heard him. Get going.

787
01:36:56,148 --> 01:36:59,879
If you want to sleep in your beds,
then find those two.

788
01:36:59,985 --> 01:37:03,819
Make sure they won't do any more
harm in our town.

789
01:37:03,923 --> 01:37:05,413
Let's get rid of him.

790
01:37:05,624 --> 01:37:06,750
Search everywhere.

791
01:37:06,892 --> 01:37:09,417
Let's stay together.

792
01:37:09,562 --> 01:37:12,292
Look everywhere.

793
01:37:27,646 --> 01:37:29,204
Hey, his friends are here.

794
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:37,348
Oh, those Indians... they always hang
around with him.

795
01:37:37,456 --> 01:37:39,947
There they are!
Those dirty Indians!

796
01:37:40,526 --> 01:37:43,324
They'll know where he is.
They always do.

797
01:37:43,429 --> 01:37:44,726
Let's make them talk.

798
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:47,355
Let me get my hands on them.

799
01:37:57,876 --> 01:37:59,707
Kill him.

800
01:38:01,213 --> 01:38:04,011
Don't shoot him. It's a sin.

801
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:07,078
I always wanted the scalp.

802
01:38:43,055 --> 01:38:44,989
A perfect job!

803
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:46,057
A perfect hairdresser.

804
01:38:46,158 --> 01:38:48,183
Well done.

805
01:38:48,294 --> 01:38:50,660
It was so easy.

806
01:38:59,538 --> 01:39:01,733
They're coming to get you.
You must hide.

807
01:39:01,907 --> 01:39:02,896
How many of them are there?

808
01:39:03,242 --> 01:39:04,231
The whole town!

809
01:39:17,089 --> 01:39:18,056
Let's go!

810
01:39:38,677 --> 01:39:40,804
Hold it, stranger.
You can't get away this time.

811
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:45,309
Come on, Willy, stop.
This man is ours.

812
01:39:52,124 --> 01:39:54,388
Now you'll have to answer to
Mr. Sorrow.

813
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,808
Where is he? What have you done?

814
01:40:18,217 --> 01:40:19,684
Your precious lover?

815
01:40:19,952 --> 01:40:23,649
Sorrow's man took him away and
tortured him to death.

816
01:40:23,989 --> 01:40:25,286
I thought you'd be pleased.

817
01:40:25,524 --> 01:40:26,821
I'll deal with you later.

818
01:40:27,659 --> 01:40:28,648
Come here.

819
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:38,363
You'll never get out of here alive.

820
01:40:41,707 --> 01:40:44,301
Hold it. We don't want him unconscious.

821
01:40:57,890 --> 01:40:59,790
You're very stupid...

822
01:40:59,892 --> 01:41:03,123
...when you could have taken
advantage of my offer...

823
01:41:03,228 --> 01:41:04,490
...to become one of my boys.

824
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:10,195
We could be friends, but you prefer
to go your own way, don't you?

825
01:41:10,402 --> 01:41:12,870
You are going to tell me
where that gold is.

826
01:41:13,572 --> 01:41:15,733
You made a mistake.

827
01:41:15,841 --> 01:41:17,399
An elementary mistake.

828
01:41:19,178 --> 01:41:24,013
Now, you're gonna have to pay.

829
01:41:24,716 --> 01:41:26,343
Mr. Sorrow doesn't like to be cheated.

830
01:41:26,852 --> 01:41:28,911
You'll tell me even if
I cut your tongue out.

831
01:41:29,922 --> 01:41:34,882
Carlos, go and prepare our
persuasive little pets.

832
01:41:36,795 --> 01:41:40,754
We'll have to get going,
but you won't be lonely.

833
01:41:40,866 --> 01:41:43,494
I'm going to make sure
you have nice company.

834
01:41:43,735 --> 01:41:49,833
Do you like the company of snakes
or blood-sucking vampire bats?

835
01:41:50,075 --> 01:41:54,535
Rats can also be good company.
You won't be lonely.

836
01:41:55,747 --> 01:41:58,807
Carlos, let's wish him a good night.
Come on.

837
01:42:03,255 --> 01:42:05,052
It's useless, Sorrow.

838
01:42:08,594 --> 01:42:10,118
You can't scare me.

839
01:42:12,631 --> 01:42:14,121
You don't know me.

840
01:42:14,466 --> 01:42:16,991
We'll see. We'll see.

841
01:42:17,302 --> 01:42:20,499
I've made stronger men than you
tell me everything.

842
01:42:21,073 --> 01:42:22,938
You'll change your ideas soon.

843
01:42:23,942 --> 01:42:25,034
Come on, Carlos.

844
01:42:25,477 --> 01:42:26,774
Sleep easy.

845
01:44:01,673 --> 01:44:03,664
Willie, Canada, Carlos.

846
01:44:03,842 --> 01:44:06,470
Come on, all of you.
We can get going!

847
01:44:06,712 --> 01:44:09,408
Our prisoner has been
persuaded to talk.

848
01:44:09,581 --> 01:44:13,381
We know where
the gold has been hidden.

849
01:44:13,919 --> 01:44:16,717
Search everywhere.

850
01:44:17,589 --> 01:44:18,578
Go now. Go!

851
01:44:46,284 --> 01:44:51,312
The cemetery... the cemetery.

852
01:44:53,725 --> 01:44:56,125
Having a good time with your friends?

853
01:44:57,129 --> 01:45:00,792
Interesting, isn't it?
It's better than any party.

854
01:45:01,967 --> 01:45:04,902
The cemetery...

855
01:45:10,642 --> 01:45:13,076
If everything goes as planned,
they should be back before dawn.

856
01:45:19,151 --> 01:45:20,140
Don't you want a drink?

857
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:00,023
How did you get here?

858
01:46:00,692 --> 01:46:03,661
You don't believe that this is just
for playing music?

859
01:46:08,033 --> 01:46:09,694
That's right, corporal.

860
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:14,739
A drink! A drink!

861
01:46:28,053 --> 01:46:30,817
All right, you dirty, old drunk!

862
01:46:35,227 --> 01:46:39,721
It's a pity you don't understand
what my boys mean to me.

863
01:46:40,232 --> 01:46:45,192
They make me so happy
in their black uniforms.

864
01:46:48,707 --> 01:46:52,541
Drink, you feathered sponge.

865
01:46:53,411 --> 01:46:56,073
You'll like it.

866
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:07,590
Damn it. There's no gold in there.
We've been tricked.

867
01:47:07,759 --> 01:47:10,751
It must have been here.
We've got to find that gold!

868
01:47:10,929 --> 01:47:12,590
Go on. What are you waiting for?

869
01:47:14,266 --> 01:47:17,394
Open every grave. Get going.

870
01:47:17,669 --> 01:47:19,159
Dig! Dig!

871
01:47:20,005 --> 01:47:23,168
Dig, damn it.
We've got to find that gold.

872
01:47:29,981 --> 01:47:34,975
Dig! We'll find that gold if we have to
tear up every grave in this cemetery.

873
01:48:56,868 --> 01:48:58,301
Give me the explosives.

874
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:59,437
Take as much as you can.

875
01:49:03,141 --> 01:49:04,130
Come on, let's go.

876
01:49:16,388 --> 01:49:17,355
Here, take this.

877
01:49:28,466 --> 01:49:29,490
Come on, let's go.

878
01:49:46,251 --> 01:49:48,242
Here they come. Go, go.

879
01:49:52,657 --> 01:49:55,251
It's the Boss's horse. Get him.

880
01:49:58,763 --> 01:49:59,730
Stop him.

881
01:49:59,864 --> 01:50:01,422
Go the other way.

882
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:03,089
Get him.

883
01:50:03,802 --> 01:50:04,894
Something's wrong.

884
01:50:05,603 --> 01:50:06,570
Get him.

885
01:50:06,671 --> 01:50:09,435
I finally got him.

886
01:50:46,511 --> 01:50:47,478
Damn you.

887
01:52:15,366 --> 01:52:17,561
What have you done, maniac?

888
01:52:47,765 --> 01:52:49,960
It's burning. It's the upper floor.

889
01:52:50,101 --> 01:52:53,969
Everything is burning.

890
01:52:57,809 --> 01:53:00,209
How did it happen?

891
01:53:00,445 --> 01:53:01,673
I hope no one is inside.

892
01:53:01,779 --> 01:53:03,644
You'd better come out quick.

893
01:53:03,781 --> 01:53:06,181
Move yourself, come on.

894
01:53:09,787 --> 01:53:12,654
We must pray. Can any of you get
down on their knees and pray?

895
01:53:12,924 --> 01:53:14,255
I've never seen a fire like this.

896
01:53:14,425 --> 01:53:16,791
What a shame.
It was a beautiful place.

897
01:53:16,895 --> 01:53:18,453
He was proud of it, wasn't he?

898
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:23,727
There's no point in letting a house
burn down like this.

899
01:53:23,868 --> 01:53:25,199
I won't give you 2 bits for it.

900
01:53:50,195 --> 01:53:52,720
Did you hear the screams?

901
01:53:52,897 --> 01:53:55,388
You can't get close.

902
01:53:55,733 --> 01:53:56,722
Fortunately it's isolated.

903
01:53:56,834 --> 01:53:58,734
Or the whole town could've burnt down.

904
01:53:58,836 --> 01:54:01,100
Let's get out of here.
It's too dangerous.

905
01:54:01,239 --> 01:54:02,866
It can collapse any moment.

906
01:55:14,178 --> 01:55:15,645
Look at me!
