1
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,144
<i>A film about the life of a photographer?</i>

2
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,147
<i>Maybe it's good at the beginning
to remember where the word comes from.</i>

3
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,342
<i>In Greek, "photo" meant "light."</i>

4
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,390
<i>"Graph" was "writing, drawing."</i>

5
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,988
<i>A photographer is literally
somebody drawing with light.</i>

6
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,021
<i>A man writing and rewriting the world
with light and shadows.</i>

7
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,623
The Serra-Pelada, Brazil's gold mine...

8
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,190
there before me!

9
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,145
When I reached the edge
of that enormous hole...

10
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,507
every hair on my body stood on end.

11
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,710
I'd never seen anything like it.

12
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,270
Here, in a split second,
I saw unfolding before me...

13
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,348
the history of mankind...

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,583
The building of the pyramids...

15
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,464
the Tower of Babel...

16
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,429
the mines of King Solomon...

17
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,826
Not the sound of
a single machine could be heard.

18
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,629
All you could hear...

19
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,306
was the babble of
50,000 people in one huge hole.

20
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,186
Conversations, noises, human sounds...

21
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,150
mingled with the sounds of manual labor...

22
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,186
I had returned to the dawn of time.

23
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,944
I could almost hear the gold whispering
in the souls of these men.

24
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,261
All this earth had to be removed.

25
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,944
It's not all gold.

26
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,184
The guys had to climb small ladders...

27
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,587
leading to bigger ones...

28
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,310
to emerge at the top.

29
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,186
You wouldn't want to fall down there!

30
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,626
If you fell from the top
you'd risk taking others with you.

31
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,470
I'd climb up several times a day...

32
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,901
but I never thought I'd fall.

33
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,301
Nobody else fell.

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,142
You were there to carry sacks, not to fall.
And in my case, to take photos.

35
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,180
These guys climbed it
50 or 60 times a day.

36
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,020
The only way
to get down such a slope...

37
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,704
is by running.

38
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,590
If you stop, you fall.

39
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,023
All these men together
formed an extremely organized world...

40
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,580
but in complete madness.

41
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,422
You get the impression they're slaves...

42
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,861
but there wasn't a single slave.

43
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,269
They were only slaves
to the idea of getting rich.

44
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,743
Everybody wanted to get rich.

45
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,229
There were all sorts:
intellectuals, university graduates...

46
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,065
farm employees...

47
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,871
urban workers...

48
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,262
People from all walks of life
were trying their luck.

49
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,470
Because when you'd hit a vein of gold...

50
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,861
everyone working
that little section of the mine...

51
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,830
had the right to choose one sack.

52
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,145
And in that sack that they chose...

53
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,422
- and this is the slavery aspect-

54
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,585
there might be nothing
or a kilo of gold!

55
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,828
At that very moment
one's freedom was at stake.

56
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,747
Men who come into contact with gold...

57
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,424
can never leave it.

58
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,387
<i>I first saw this picture here, in a gallery,</i>

59
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,781
<i>more than 20 years ago.</i>

60
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,261
<i>I had no idea who took it.</i>

61
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,549
<i>Whoever it was had to be both
a great photographer</i>

62
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,430
<i>and an adventurer, I thought.</i>

63
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,151
<i>There was a stamp on the back
and a signature,</i>

64
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,826
<i>Sebastião Salgado.</i>

65
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,221
<i>I acquired the print.</i>

66
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,467
<i>The gallerist pulled other pictures,</i>

67
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,305
<i>by the same photographer, from a drawer.</i>

68
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,190
<i>What I saw profoundly moved me,</i>

69
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,945
<i>especially this image here,</i>

70
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,069
a <i>portrait of</i> a <i>blind Tuareg woman.</i>

71
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,702
<i>It still moves me to tears,
even if I see it every day,</i>

72
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,421
<i>as it's hanging over my desk ever since.</i>

73
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,903
<i>So one thing I knew already
about this Sebastião Salgado,</i>

74
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,665
<i>he really cared about people.</i>

75
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,584
<i>That meant a lot, in my book.</i>

76
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,346
<i>After all, people are the salt of the earth.</i>

77
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,386
<i>It took</i> a <i>while until we finally met and talked</i>

78
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,428
<i>about his life, his work,</i>

79
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,151
<i>and where it was all coming from.</i>

80
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,386
If you put too many photographers
in one place...

81
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,464
they'll all take very different pictures.

82
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,107
Because they necessarily come...

83
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,148
from very diverse places.

84
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,023
Each one forms their way of seeing...

85
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,509
according to their history.

86
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,542
I feel that in my case...

87
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,501
I learned to shape my way of seeing
here, in this place.

88
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,590
Here I have an idea of the planet.

89
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,182
I'd go for long walks with my father...

90
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,109
across this farm.

91
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,421
We'd come here to look.

92
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,831
Behind each mountain there's a story,
there's something to see.

93
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,989
I'd dream a lot here.

94
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,623
I wanted to go beyond the mountains,
I wanted to know.

95
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,146
Sebastião was such a rascal!

96
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,587
He was always traveling...

97
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,782
like no one I'd ever seen.

98
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,990
My dad was the same, he never stopped.

99
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,904
Back and forth, like a shuttle.

100
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,105
Just like Sebastião.

101
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,548
You'd think he was in Vitória,
but he'd already be here...

102
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,102
or up north doing politics.

103
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,667
Without his fellow students
he wouldn't have finished his studies.

104
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,591
Tiao was a scamp
when it came to studying.

105
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,460
He was a handful, but he managed
to get his economics degree.

106
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,550
I wanted him to be a lawyer.

107
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,866
He did one year...

108
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,025
then switched to economics,
which was good for him.

109
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,144
<i>That was Sebastião Salgado.</i>

110
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,382
<i>The father, that is.</i>

111
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,784
<i>He passed his name on to his only son, who,</i>

112
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,910
<i>even if he remained
a restless traveler for all his life,</i>

113
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,144
<i>did profit from
the studies his dad had obliged him to</i>

114
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,540
<i>in ways he could not have
anticipated himself.</i>

115
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,305
<i>His education as an economist</i>

116
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,542
<i>equipped him with a solid knowledge</i>

117
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,908
<i>of global markets, trade and industry,</i>

118
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,586
<i>so he knew what was driving the world.</i>

119
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,666
<i>For our man, it all started in the little town</i>

120
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,023
<i>of Aimorés, in central Brazil.</i>

121
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,900
<i>There was his father's cattle farm
under the big sky.</i>

122
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,790
<i>There were vast Atlantic rain forests.</i>

123
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,467
<i>There was the river,
still navigable at the time.</i>

124
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,465
<i>But most of all, there were
the endless trains running by,</i>

125
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,987
<i>filled to the brim with minerals and iron ore,</i>

126
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,149
<i>that would go from here into the world.</i>

127
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,943
<i>After all, this was and still is
the biggest mining region on the planet.</i>

128
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,910
<i>This is where young Sebastião grew up,</i>

129
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,267
<i>the only boy among seven sisters,</i>

130
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,466
<i>what a life!</i>

131
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,869
<i>All summers long, he played on the banks
of the Rio Doce, the "Sweet River."</i>

132
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,388
<i>That's where you are now.</i>

133
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,107
<i>And here we are, our little documentary crew.</i>

134
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,791
<i>I learned one thing.</i>

135
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,670
<i>Having a photographer
in front of your camera</i>

136
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,823
<i>is very different from filming anybody else.</i>

137
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,700
<i>He would not just be there
and act like himself, so to speak.</i>

138
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,070
<i>No, by profession, he reacts and responds</i>

139
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,507
<i>using his weapon of choice,
his photo camera.</i>

140
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,389
<i>Our man shoots back.</i>

141
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,749
- Wim, I have a nice shot of you.
- And I got one of you!

142
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,226
I bet you did!

143
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,350
<i>In this case, he wasn't just shooting at me.</i>

144
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,701
Look...

145
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,266
<i>He had two of us in front of his lens.</i>

146
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,231
<i>The other guy, my fellow director,
was his oldest son, Juliano.</i>

147
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,101
<i>He had already accompanied his father
with his camera on several journeys,</i>

148
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,185
<i>like to Papua New Guinea,
which you just saw before,</i>

149
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,501
<i>or here, to a remote island</i>

150
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,550
<i>far north on the East Siberian Sea.</i>

151
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,271
<i>I wish I could have gone there, too.</i>

152
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,271
<i>Father and son Salgado
invited me to join them</i>

153
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,786
<i>and continue this film together,</i>

154
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,625
<i>to add an outside view
to their adventure, I guess.</i>

155
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,542
<i>I didn't hesitate a bit.</i>

156
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,941
<i>What else could I ask for?</i>

157
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,711
<i>I would finally get to know this man,</i>

158
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,067
<i>find out what was driving him,</i>

159
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,462
<i>and why his work had left
such an impression on me.</i>

160
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,788
<i>Little did I know that I was going to discover</i>

161
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,023
<i>much more than just a photographer.</i>

162
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,223
<i>Sebastião was 15 years old
when he took the train</i>

163
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,780
<i>to leave the little country town for good,</i>

164
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,785
<i>to go to high school
in the provincial capital of Vitória.</i>

165
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,582
<i>Our young man didn't know, at first,
what to do with the money in his pockets.</i>

166
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,311
<i>He had never paid for anything in cash.</i>

167
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,065
<i>At the farm, they had produced
everything themselves,</i>

168
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,030
<i>so he stayed hungry during
the first weeks in the big city,</i>

169
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,582
<i>afraid of going into a pub
and just ordering something to eat.</i>

170
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,262
<i>We are in the dark
what Sebastião would have become</i>

171
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,742
<i>if this young woman here
hadn't entered the picture.</i>

172
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,231
<i>Lélia.</i>

173
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,187
<i>She was 17, a music student,
and utterly beautiful.</i>

174
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,467
<i>It was love at first sight.</i>

175
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,783
<i>When Sebastião got a scholarship
for a master in economics</i>

176
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,862
<i>at a university in São Paulo,</i>

177
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,420
<i>they moved there and got married.</i>

178
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,630
<i>Where in the mid-'60s,</i>

179
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,101
<i>they were both involved in leftist politics,</i>

180
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,390
<i>like a lot of their fellow students
in Paris, Berlin or Chicago.</i>

181
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,624
<i>Brazil was under the reign
of a brutal military dictatorship,</i>

182
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,789
<i>so there was a daily danger
of being arrested,</i>

183
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,068
<i>deported and tortured.</i>

184
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,301
<i>In August of 1969,</i>

185
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,346
<i>Sebastião and Lélia left their home country</i>

186
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,627
<i>and took a boat to France.</i>

187
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,628
<i>While Sebastião continued
his formation as economist,</i>

188
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,180
<i>Lélia studied architecture.</i>

189
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,106
<i>One memorable day, she bought
a photo camera for her work,</i>

190
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,309
<i>and the one who had all the fun
with it was Sebastião.</i>

191
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,068
<i>The first picture he ever took
was of Lélia, of course.</i>

192
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,668
<i>And then Sebastião got a job
at the International Coffee Organization</i>

193
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,629
<i>and they moved to London.</i>

194
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,987
<i>Heading for a career at the World Bank,</i>

195
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,349
<i>he often traveled to Africa
to survey development projects.</i>

196
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,502
<i>He would take Lélia's camera with him,</i>

197
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,348
<i>and would always come back
with lots of pictures.</i>

198
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,822
<i>Realizing that these photographs</i>

199
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,740
<i>gave him so much more pleasure
than his economic reports,</i>

200
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,262
<i>the two of them made
a bold decision together.</i>

201
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,308
<i>He should take the enormous risk,</i>

202
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,264
<i>abandon a promising,
well-paid career as an economist,</i>

203
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,263
<i>and start from scratch.</i>

204
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,309
<i>They moved back to Paris
and invested all they had</i>

205
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,104
<i>in expensive photo equipment.</i>

206
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,666
<i>For a while,
Sebastião tried his hand at sports,</i>

207
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,062
<i>did portraits, weddings and even nudes,</i>

208
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,501
<i>before he found his vocation.</i>

209
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,862
These were
my first photographs.

210
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,910
We were in the city of Tahoua.

211
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,863
Young mothers were standing in line...

212
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,989
to get some food...

213
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,191
as there'd been a severe drought
in Niger in '73.

214
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,348
For Lélia it was tough,
because she was pregnant.

215
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,141
I remember, we were in that very place...

216
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,668
living at a friend's home at Niamey...

217
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,230
when the local Marabout came by.

218
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,311
Lélia was wearing shorts,
she was really pretty.

219
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,987
And the Marabout sat down...

220
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,062
and said to her...

221
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,507
"Come sit on my lap!"

222
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,303
"Oh," I said...

223
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,351
"Mr. Marabout, there's a slight problem...

224
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,181
This woman is pregnant...

225
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,589
with our first child.

226
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,869
So it's best she stays put."

227
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,701
So he understood that...

228
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,467
it wasn't the right synchronicity.

229
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,942
So we talked it over
and he left with a kilo of sugar...

230
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,711
as happy as if it'd been Lélia.

231
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,545
<i>Their son Juliano was born in Paris in 1974.</i>

232
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,589
<i>Here he is, my future pal and co-director.</i>

233
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,267
<i>Lélia continued to support Sebastião
with all she could as</i> a <i>young mother.</i>

234
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,308
<i>She worked hard, parallel to her studies,</i>

235
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,623
<i>and presented Sebastião's
photographs everywhere,</i>

236
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,670
<i>to magazines, newspapers and agencies.</i>

237
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,470
<i>And then,
after a few significant publications,</i>

238
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,941
<i>the two of them felt encouraged to envision</i>

239
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,024
<i>a first big photographic project on their own,</i>

240
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,788
Otras Americas.

241
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,862
"The Other Americas."

242
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,823
<i>It was going to take Sebastião
all across South America.</i>

243
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,109
<i>Little Juliano was getting used
to seeing his dad off</i>

244
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,501
<i>for long absences at a time.</i>

245
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,785
Ever since we'd left Brazil in 1969...

246
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,150
I'd deeply missed South America.

247
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,786
So I decided to travel...

248
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,181
around Brazil's neighboring countries:

249
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,787
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia...

250
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,387
I dreamt of seeing the mountains
of South America...

251
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,791
the Andes.

252
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,869
At the time, in South America...

253
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,706
there was a profound social movement...

254
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,465
the "Liberation Theology".

255
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,541
And on this journey
I met a young priest, in Ecuador...

256
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,463
called Gabicho.

257
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,102
We were both young,
I a photographer, he a priest.

258
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,990
He brought them the word of God...

259
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,982
he organized the farmers into cooperatives,
introduced solidarity.

260
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,946
And since he had access
to all these communities...

261
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,382
those journeys I made were extraordinary.

262
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,591
There we were, over 3,000 meters up.

263
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,746
We'd climb 600 or 700 meters in a day.

264
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,784
It was a sheer delight
to live in this landscape...

265
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,510
among these communities.

266
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,182
These are the Saraguros,
a tribe of Indians in the south of Ecuador.

267
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:59,346
Very religious, but also great drinkers.

268
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,708
Over half of them, at the weekend,
men and women...

269
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,942
would get totally drunk.

270
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,108
The villager on the left...

271
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,630
his name is Lupe, Guadalupe...

272
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,386
Lupe and I became very close.

273
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,223
At the time I had very long hair...

274
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,223
long blond hair...

275
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,509
with a big, reddish blond beard.

276
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,705
Walking with him through the mountains...

277
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,421
one day he said to me, "Listen, Sebastião.

278
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,544
I know that you were sent from heaven."

279
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,511
According to the Saraguros' legends...

280
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,420
God, in the image of Christ...

281
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,983
was to return to Earth to observe them...

282
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,706
to decide who'd go to heaven.

283
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,469
As we walked in the mountains,
he told me about his life.

284
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,551
He seriously believed that I'd come
as a special observer...

285
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,386
to report "up there"
about their behavior.

286
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,426
Never in my life had I met a people...

287
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,982
with such a different sense of time.

288
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,866
The time I spent with the Saraguros
felt like an entire century...

289
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,227
everything felt so slow.

290
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,302
It was another way of thinking,
a different rhythm.

291
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,790
There was a fatalism on their faces.

292
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,383
This is in the state of Oaxaca, in Mexico.

293
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,987
A group of farmers called the Mixe.

294
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,629
It's all medieval, the yoke, the plow...

295
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,264
This is deepest South America.

296
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,745
They were a country people...

297
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,903
but what mattered most to them...

298
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,391
was music.

299
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,748
They were people who adored music.

300
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,985
Every member of the community
able to play an instrument...

301
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,981
didn't have to do any work...

302
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,188
they worked as musicians.

303
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,149
They had me sleep for several days...

304
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,225
in a very cold cement room...

305
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,464
to see if I could bear it,
if I really wanted to stay...

306
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,464
As I held out for quite a while...

307
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,589
they finally put me up in a house...

308
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,670
and I grew much closer to the community.

309
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,390
It was a pleasure for me.

310
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,226
We became close friends,
I felt good there.

311
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,310
This is in the north of Mexico.
The Tarahumara.

312
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,349
These people are great runners,
long-distance runners.

313
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,229
They don't walk, they run.

314
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,744
God, it was hell trying to keep up.

315
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,591
They didn't walk, they flew!

316
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,750
That's a Tarahumara...

317
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,229
his face deeply marked by life.

318
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,264
Beautiful hair, fantastic hair.

319
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,103
People would approach my camera...

320
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,424
and I had the impression
I was more a sound recorder.

321
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,149
They'd tell me things
as if I was recording their stories.

322
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,786
The power of a portrait
lies in that fraction of a second...

323
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,829
when you catch a glimpse
of that person's life.

324
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,740
The eyes say a lot,
the expression on the face...

325
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,788
When you take a portrait,
the shot is not yours alone.

326
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,221
The person offers it to you.

327
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,704
Those journeys meant so much to me.

328
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,030
To come here after all those years,
unable to set foot in my own country.

329
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,503
The essence was the same.
It was my continent, we were so close.

330
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,868
<i>Otras Americas took Sebastião eight years.</i>

331
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,023
<i>On these journeys
into the deepest South America,</i>

332
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,503
<i>he simply disappeared
for extended periods of time.</i>

333
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,665
<i>Juliano largely grew up
with an absent father.</i>

334
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,507
<i>His parents could at least
write letters back and forth.</i>

335
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,869
<i>This was, of course, long before
any satellite communication.</i>

336
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,188
<i>Whenever he came home in between,</i>

337
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,106
<i>to see his family and to edit
his photos together with Lélia,</i>

338
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,821
<i>Sebastião appeared
like a great adventurer to his son,</i>

339
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,666
<i>some kind of superhero,
rather than a photographer.</i>

340
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,071
<i>And jump cut...</i>

341
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,860
<i>...to me, 30 years later.</i>

342
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,625
<i>I finally join my father
on one of his missions</i>

343
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,864
<i>to Wrangel, a deserted island
in the Arctic Ocean.</i>

344
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,191
<i>Sebastião was hoping to photograph
the last big congregations of walruses.</i>

345
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,309
<i>I wanted to find out who that man was,</i>

346
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,543
<i>the man I had only known as my father.</i>

347
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,507
<i>I wanted to discover the photographer,</i>

348
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,146
<i>the adventurer, for the first time.</i>

349
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,742
Goddamn bear!

350
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,345
He tricked us.

351
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,346
He drove them all into the water.
Incredible!

352
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,869
What do you think?

353
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,828
What do you think, Dad?

354
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,700
I think it'll be complicated
to get this story.

355
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,149
If this is all we've got...

356
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,668
It's not just a matter of getting close
to a bear and taking a picture.

357
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,391
If the framing is poor...

358
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,425
you'll just show the bear,
but it won't be a photo.

359
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,944
This spot is no good.

360
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,745
There's nothing in the background...

361
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,108
nothing to compose a well-framed picture.

362
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,980
No action, nothing.

363
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,550
Stunning!

364
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,067
All I could see
was the shape of their tusks.

365
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,508
Impossible to make out
the outline of their heads.

366
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,351
It was like being in Dante's Inferno...

367
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,588
with those tusks protruding...

368
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,987
All those shapes... Incredible!

369
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,747
Dad, what happened in 1979?

370
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,026
In '79, Lélia was pregnant
with our second son.

371
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,347
We knew it was a boy.

372
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,467
When Rodrigo was born...

373
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,063
he had all the signs of Down's syndrome.

374
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,781
He was so cute with his slanted eyes...

375
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,831
I felt he was completely normal.

376
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,709
So did Lélia.

377
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,626
The doctor did a lot of tests.
It was three weeks before we knew.

378
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,862
On the day he called...

379
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,984
the tension was such...

380
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,631
that when I heard the results, I cried.

381
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,782
I couldn't stop crying.

382
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,347
<i>My baby brother was never going</i>

383
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,630
<i>to be able to go to school
or learn how to read and write</i>

384
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,986
<i>like I would.</i>

385
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,031
<i>Rodrigo would be isolated in a world
we would never be able to share.</i>

386
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,266
<i>This was very hard on my parents.</i>

387
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,027
<i>But then something happened.</i>

388
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,507
<i>Through his love,
Rodrigo developed a language of his own.</i>

389
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,668
<i>Slowly, as a family,</i>

390
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,471
<i>we learned to decipher
his emotional alphabet</i>

391
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,271
<i>and to communicate without words.</i>

392
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,023
<i>Sometime later, my mum, my brother and I
took an airplane to Brazil.</i>

393
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,865
<i>The military dictatorship had crumbled.</i>

394
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,511
<i>I was five, and I didn't really understand</i>

395
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,789
<i>how important that long trip was going to be.</i>

396
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,868
<i>At some point,
a man opened one of the blinds,</i>

397
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,308
<i>and direct sunlight poured into the airplane.</i>

398
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,705
<i>His voice echoed through the cabin,</i>

399
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,908
<i>"We're flying over Brazil."</i>

400
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,507
<i>My mum looked through the window
and went silent.</i>

401
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,746
<i>She was seeing her own country
for the first time, after so many years.</i>

402
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,064
<i>It was such a happy moment,
and yet, when she turned to me,</i>

403
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,983
<i>she was crying.</i>

404
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,343
<i>As for my father, he was in French Guiana
and was going to join us later.</i>

405
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,100
It was December 31,
I'd returned to Brazil!

406
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,184
It was great to be home...

407
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,983
after ten and a half years abroad.

408
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,547
It was a shock.
Lélia's hometown wasn't the same.

409
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,946
Vitória had changed a lot.
Everything was different.

410
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,660
My region had changed a lot too.

411
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,270
When I left my parents,
they were young and strong.

412
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,789
Upon returning, I found an old man.
My father had aged a lot.

413
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,020
But at that time...

414
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,502
I wanted to explore Brazil more deeply.

415
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,586
My sister lent me a car...

416
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,188
and I made a six-month journey
in the North-East of Brazil.

417
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,382
I didn't know the North-East.

418
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,782
I'd always dreamt of that part of Brazil.

419
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,344
These people were going to a funeral.

420
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,224
I stopped by the roadside
and went with them.

421
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,584
Infant mortality was very high
in the North-East of Brazil.

422
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,584
These children died
before they were baptized.

423
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,548
They believe that children
who are not baptized...

424
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,344
don't have the right to go to heaven.

425
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,506
They stay in an in-between realm...

426
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,105
called limbo.

427
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,587
If a child dies with its eyes closed
it's because it was baptized.

428
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,384
If its eyes are open...

429
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,942
they leave them open
so it can find its way.

430
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,065
Otherwise it will wander for eternity.

431
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,464
Back then, there was a service
for renting coffins at the church.

432
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,947
You could rent a coffin cheaply.

433
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,704
It'd be used dozens of times.

434
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,302
There you can see
such a coffin rental service.

435
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,868
And yes, those are shoes.

436
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,468
They sold everything:
shoes, coffins, bananas, vegetables...

437
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,186
ice-cream, everything...

438
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,228
It's a region
where life and death are very close.

439
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,790
Here's a group saying prayers...

440
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,148
and learning about politics
at the same time.

441
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,703
In Brazil there was, and still is...

442
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,989
a big movement
called the "Landless Workers".

443
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,668
Many of them came from here...

444
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,060
from the North-East of Brazil.

445
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,021
These people...

446
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,030
have a moral strength...

447
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,990
a physical force...

448
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,985
even though they're frail and eat poorly.

449
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,862
Look how arid this region is.

450
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,668
It's like a piece of the Sahel in Brazil.

451
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,142
Here, on the road...

452
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,064
people are leaving, never to return.

453
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,625
Sometimes it's so dry,
so difficult here...

454
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,465
that people migrate
to the southern cities.

455
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,703
For them it's over,
they abandon the land.

456
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,024
For many years now...

457
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,469
we've been suffering
from a lack of rain.

458
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,671
There were a lot of cattle here before...

459
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,981
but they're all gone now.

460
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,943
There have been severe droughts.

461
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,741
The pastures are gone,
it doesn't pay anymore.

462
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,627
Why has it gone, Grandfather?

463
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,987
Because of the drought.

464
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,629
We replanted,
but there's not a blade of grass left.

465
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,742
It wasn't that long ago.

466
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,701
Your dad and I...

467
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,824
we spent more than 20,000.

468
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,426
Where did it go?

469
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,462
This land was so plentiful.

470
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,828
There were lots of birds...

471
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,143
canaries and ticoticos...

472
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,785
blackbirds...

473
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,020
There used to be a great forest
on that hill...

474
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,821
and another forest over that hill.

475
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,710
There has been a lot of erosion.

476
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,669
The hills are now barren.

477
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,311
When it rains...

478
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,066
there's nothing to hold back the water.

479
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,182
It's a disaster.

480
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,142
I have no idea...

481
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,664
how to stop it.

482
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,468
Grandpa, were you happy on this farm?

483
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,541
Sorry?

484
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,191
Were you happy here?

485
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,826
Was <i>I</i> happy'?

486
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,870
I was, because I was able
to provide an education...

487
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,149
for my seven daughters...

488
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,587
and Sebastião.

489
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,909
I raised my children,
it was tough...

490
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,550
but I'm happy I did it.

491
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,905
I earned 100,000 from the woods alone...

492
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,221
to put the children through school.

493
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,064
They were all brought up well...

494
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,587
well fed, properly dressed...

495
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,469
<i>Since I first came to Brazil,</i>

496
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,986
<i>my grandfather's land
had always been this way,</i>

497
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,947
<i>burnt and dried out.</i>

498
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,027
<i>When Sebastião came back to the farm
after his journeys through North-East Brazil,</i>

499
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,742
<i>the place was hardly the paradise
he had known as a child.</i>

500
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,903
<i>But he had something else on his mind,</i>

501
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,189
<i>the suffering he had witnessed changed him.</i>

502
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,747
<i>His role as a photographer
took on a whole new meaning.</i>

503
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,023
<i>We understood the urgency he felt to leave.</i>

504
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,102
<i>I still missed him a lot.</i>

505
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,543
<i>But I understood.</i>

506
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,662
<i>For his next project, which would take him
to the Sahel region of Africa,</i>

507
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,506
<i>Sebastião started to work
with Doctors Without Borders.</i>

508
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,789
I worked in Ethiopia in 1984...

509
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,581
and continued across the Sahel
in '85 and '86.

510
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,506
I spent almost two years in that region...

511
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,022
reporting on the famine.

512
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,581
There were refugee camps...

513
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,789
the largest ever seen in human history.

514
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,264
And I really wanted to show that.

515
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,504
To show that a large part of humanity...

516
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,590
was suffering from great distress...

517
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,346
due to a problem of sharing...

518
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,308
and not just a natural disaster.

519
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,911
This was a Coptic region.

520
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,150
They are very strict Christians,
the Northern Ethiopians.

521
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,905
They have great humility.

522
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,711
Even with a dying child...

523
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,505
they wouldn't get in front of others.

524
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,945
They'd rather wait.

525
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,182
Look at the state of the people.

526
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,710
At that stage, they've no strength left.

527
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,382
They say people die of famine.

528
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,067
Famine weakens the body...

529
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,070
but it's the parallel diseases that kill.

530
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,669
When you catch cholera,
the dehydration is so fast...

531
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,302
that you lose 12 liters of water
a day from diarrhea.

532
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,068
You die in two or three days.

533
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,268
Such young faces...

534
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,026
aged from so much suffering.

535
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,108
If you look at his forehead,
he's not an old man.

536
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,309
What's old about him
is the emptiness in his eyes.

537
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,388
Look how young she is,
look at their baby!

538
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,470
He's her husband.

539
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,462
Most deaths were at night...

540
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,945
from the cold.

541
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,545
Dying here
was really a continuation of life.

542
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,463
The people were used to dying.

543
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,780
A husband is washing his wife to bury her.

544
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,625
In his mountain clothes, his goat skin...

545
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,391
A very young woman.

546
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,388
In the Coptic ritual...

547
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,510
the body has to be clean
when it comes before God.

548
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,703
You have to wash it all over...

549
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,782
even if there's very little water.

550
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,221
With each dying person
a piece of everyone else dies.

551
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,190
A father is preparing his son for burial...

552
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,661
saying his last goodbye.

553
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,864
Family members usually prepare their dead.

554
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,670
Knowing that a government...

555
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,621
is withholding food from its people...

556
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,704
as was the actual case here...

557
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,670
in this camp in Northern Ethiopia...

558
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:51,143
That was brutal political dishonesty.

559
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,703
I returned to Ethiopia
at the end of 1984.

560
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:14,782
The guerillas knew the government
was about to drive these people out...

561
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,063
so they started evacuating people
towards Sudan.

562
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,505
They left from all over Tigray.

563
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,111
We were attacked by two helicopters.

564
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,981
Mi-24s.
Very fast combat helicopters.

565
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,580
They shot at the people with machine-guns.

566
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,461
I took a photo and then I ran.

567
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,867
There were many pregnant women...

568
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,470
hoping that when they'd arrive
they'd find food and water.

569
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,305
That they'd finally reach
the promised land.

570
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,828
I must have spent...

571
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,983
at least two months there.

572
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,863
And when I arrived in Sudan...

573
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,308
I did a lot of work
on the arrival of these people.

574
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,101
This man had come from Ethiopia.

575
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,468
His camel had reached its limit.
Maybe it was dead.

576
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,146
But the man was holding on and on...

577
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:22,269
Yet when he reached the doctors,
his child was dead.

578
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,230
After such a long march.

579
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,989
Doctors Without Borders
had to give up this camp.

580
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,464
Water is essential in these camps...

581
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,383
and it had become a huge problem.

582
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,669
So they had to move the camp
as fast as possible.

583
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,383
People were crammed into UN trucks...

584
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,828
to take them to a new camp...

585
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,387
on a beautiful and fertile piece of land...

586
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,031
on the banks of the Blue Nile.

587
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,502
I rode on this truck
for at least 300 or 400 kilometers.

588
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,266
These are two friends...

589
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,584
pretending it was
a normal Sunday afternoon...

590
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,709
sitting under a tree, telling stories...

591
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,980
There's lots of water by the Nile,
but that's where the people died...

592
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,986
because“.

593
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,588
There was nothing to eat.

594
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,550
They were in the final stages
of their distress.

595
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,629
They'd forgotten to bring food,
or hadn't been able to.

596
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,584
The food distribution had gone wrong.

597
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,941
These people had held on so long...

598
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,864
but when they got there,
they could no more.

599
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,429
I went to Mali.

600
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,066
There was a severe drought there too.

601
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,024
The skin becomes like tree bark...

602
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,062
like a tree marked by the desert wind...

603
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,824
by sandstorm after sandstorm...

604
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,148
There were only women and kids.

605
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,951
The men had left to work in Libya...

606
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:41,106
or headed for the Ivory Coast,
looking for work...

607
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:45,145
promising to return
and bring food for the family.

608
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,501
But very few came back.

609
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,068
They were all saved...

610
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,064
because Doctors Without Borders
did great work.

611
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,462
They brought assistance
to this whole area.

612
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,667
This is a friend, Luc, a Belgian doctor.

613
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,268
Measuring a kid, weighing him.

614
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,421
In two or three weeks
these children completely recover.

615
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,026
They're marked by it, all their lives...

616
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,991
having experienced
such deprivation while growing up.

617
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,101
This boy was alone...

618
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,423
with his instrument,
his little guitar, in his hand...

619
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,266
With his rag of a shirt
still hanging on him.

620
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,183
No trousers, nothing.

621
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,425
Look at his determination, his posture.

622
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,027
He knew where he was going.

623
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,150
Looking for other groups,
looking for a village...

624
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,786
with his dog...

625
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,386
A boy of eight or nine.

626
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:14,422
<i>Sebastião became very attached
to the people in the Sahel region of Africa.</i>

627
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,707
<i>He returned over and over again.</i>

628
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,947
<i>His photographs, the book and the exhibition
that Lelia edited and put together</i>

629
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:27,151
<i>called worldwide attention to these droughts
and their threats to millions of lives,</i>

630
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,824
<i>and opened questions.</i>

631
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,744
<i>What had caused these conditions
in the first place?</i>

632
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:38,308
<i>Afterwards, Sebastião turned to a subject
that would take another six years</i>

633
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,630
<i>and countless journeys
to almost 30 countries all over the globe.</i>

634
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,830
<i>Workers, the third huge volume
of photographs</i>

635
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,267
<i>he and Lélia conceived together.</i>

636
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,901
I wanted to pay homage...

637
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,585
to all the men and women
who built the world around us.

638
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,741
An archeology of the industrial era.

639
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,869
<i>Sebastião and Lelia did extended research</i>

640
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,705
<i>and planned Workers meticulously.</i>

641
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,263
<i>And then he traveled again,
to the four corners of the world,</i>

642
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,947
<i>photographing steelworkers
in the Soviet Union,</i>

643
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,864
<i>living with ship breakers in Bangladesh,</i>

644
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,786
<i>going to sea with fishermen
in Galicia and Sicily,</i>

645
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,909
<i>showing the mechanical production
of cars in Calcutta,</i>

646
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:29,703
<i>observing tea pickers in Rwanda,
a country he had first gone as an economist.</i>

647
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,944
<i>He came on a different mission now,
with a changed view,</i>

648
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,381
<i>but he was still the same man,</i>

649
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,101
<i>driven by the same empathy
for the human condition.</i>

650
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,386
<i>Each of these chapters of Workers</i>

651
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,384
<i>meant that Sebastião
would immerse completely</i>

652
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,304
<i>in that particular field of manual labor.</i>

653
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,985
<i>Like the weeks he spent
with the gold diggers at the Serra-Pelada.</i>

654
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,426
<i>In 1991, at the end of the first Gulf War,</i>

655
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,788
<i>if you remember, the Iraqi troops withdrew</i>

656
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,910
<i>and Saddam Hussein set fire
to hundreds of oil wells.</i>

657
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,665
<i>An army of firefighters
from all over the world</i>

658
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,266
<i>moved to the burning oil fields.</i>

659
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,583
<i>Sebastião just had to go as well,</i>

660
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,948
<i>driven by a curiosity
for this explosive profession.</i>

661
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,826
As soon as I saw the first images on

662
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,946
I felt the urge to cover this story.

663
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,343
It was like working in a huge theater.

664
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,540
500 oil wells burning.

665
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,829
A giant stage, the size of the planet.

666
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,669
No restrictions,
you could go where you wanted.

667
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,384
There was a discharge
of heavy oil smoke.

668
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:59,224
The smoke was so dense,
the sun couldn't cut through.

669
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:06,541
There were days
when it was dark for 24 hours straight.

670
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,984
Once a fire was put out...

671
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,030
the earth was still very hot.

672
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,230
They had to pour a huge amount
of water on to cool it.

673
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:25,550
If not, the oil would just re-ignite.

674
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,184
But despite that...

675
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,582
there'd sometimes be an explosion,
like a cannon shot.

676
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,821
The noise was so deafening...

677
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,944
it was like working next to a jet engine.

678
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,582
Now I'm a little deaf.

679
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,102
That's where my deafness began.

680
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,470
These are Canadians...

681
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,941
a unit of firefighters from Calgary.

682
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,386
They'd brought a beautiful red truck.

683
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,942
And it was their rule,
once they'd put out a fire...

684
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,223
to wash the truck every evening.

685
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,668
And in the morning
it'd be covered in oil again.

686
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,463
A hellish job!

687
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,222
I put off my departure
at least 2 or 3 times...

688
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,621
until I really had to leave.

689
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,988
But it broke my heart...

690
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:41,746
to abandon this vast spectacle.

691
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,743
I roamed around.

692
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,585
And very close to the end...

693
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:52,585
we were driving by this long wall...

694
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,506
- That day I was with a journalist
from The New York <i>Times</i> -

695
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,586
Since it was a no-man's-land,
ruined by war...

696
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,583
we broke down the gate.

697
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,071
And inside...

698
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,431
we found a sort of...

699
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,025
paradise...

700
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,182
that had turned into hell.

701
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,865
It was a garden
belonging to the Kuwaiti royal family...

702
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,343
with horses, thoroughbreds...

703
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,027
that had gone completely,
desperately insane.

704
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,946
Animals are the first
to flee from a catastrophe...

705
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,102
when they're free to leave.

706
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,743
But here, they weren't.

707
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,190
There were birds there too,
it was an oasis...

708
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,422
very well irrigated.

709
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:45,908
Birds who couldn't fly anymore
as their feathers were stuck together.

710
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,900
The Kuwaitis fled
when they felt the disaster approaching...

711
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,823
leaving behind the imprisoned animals...

712
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,541
and the Bedouins
whom they didn't really consider as humans.

713
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:05,742
<i>Workers finally united the economist
in Sebastião Salgado</i>

714
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,585
<i>and the artist he had become.</i>

715
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,903
<i>The pictures appeared
in most of the great magazines,</i>

716
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,187
<i>the exhibition traveled all over the world,</i>

717
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,581
<i>and the book came out in many languages.</i>

718
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:20,104
<i>But Sebastião and Lélia wouldn't rest.</i>

719
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:25,947
<i>They immediately started to work
on another major phase of his photography.</i>

720
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:30,070
<i>They realized that one of
the burning subjects of our times</i>

721
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:33,383
<i>was the displacement of entire populations</i>

722
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,067
<i>by wars, famines
or the rules of the global marketplace.</i>

723
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,021
<i>So while Europe was starting
to close its borders,</i>

724
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,310
<i>Sebastião was trying to shine a light
on the fates of the outcast.</i>

725
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:51,343
<i>Again, he and Lelia
did all the research and planning together,</i>

726
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,548
<i>and again, she was the driving force</i>

727
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:58,023
<i>behind this new chapter in their lives,
which they called “Exodus?</i>

728
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,909
<i>It created a worldwide awareness
for the fate of all these refugees</i>

729
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,221
<i>in India, Vietnam, the Philippines,</i>

730
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,146
<i>South America, Palestine, Iraq
and many other places.</i>

731
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,347
<i>But Sebastião, over and over,</i>

732
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:18,142
<i>returned to the continent that had
caught his imagination for so long already,</i>

733
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,949
<i>to Africa.</i>

734
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,823
I was doing my project
on the displacement of peoples...

735
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,902
in 1994...

736
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,822
when the president of Rwanda...

737
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,382
his plane was shot down.

738
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,468
That started a huge exodus
towards Tanzania...

739
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:49,704
due to the brutal repression
of the Tutsis in Rwanda.

740
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:55,190
I was one of the first to arrive there.

741
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,461
The catastrophe was everywhere.

742
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,066
People were fleeing to Burundi...

743
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,541
to the Congo, to Uganda...

744
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,861
They were leaving in all directions.

745
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,591
The roads were already full of people...

746
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,141
People sleeping by the roadsides...

747
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:22,066
carrying all their belongings on bicycles...

748
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:25,104
fleeing with whatever they could take.

749
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,710
We headed in the opposite direction...

750
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:32,023
towards the border.

751
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,910
There was no border control whatsoever.

752
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,780
I entered Rwanda, and it was terrifying.

753
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,186
The number of dead bodies
I saw on that road...

754
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,422
Here, a grenade had exploded.

755
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,781
Those not killed by the grenade
were killed with machetes.

756
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,947
There, I began to sense...

757
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,581
the sheer scale of the disaster
I was witnessing.

758
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,981
A genocide was in progress here.

759
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:12,347
It was 150 kilometers by road to Kigali...

760
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,900
150 kilometers of dead bodies...

761
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:25,988
I turned back,
because my story was about people.

762
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,264
I was doing my book on refugees,
I was working on Exodus.

763
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,071
I started going into the camps...

764
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,790
and I began to see...

765
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,666
the sheer number of people
leaving Rwanda.

766
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,703
Hell was taking the place of paradise.

767
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:46,221
It was frightening...

768
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,941
to see, on such a beautiful savanna...

769
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,149
this mega city springing up.

770
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:59,141
Within days,
there were almost a million people here.

771
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,390
Among all this distress,
one thing that really moved me...

772
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,902
was the relationship
between this mother and her child...

773
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,666
and the child's trust in its mother.

774
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,664
Violence...

775
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,024
and brutality...

776
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,502
are not the monopoly...

777
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,628
of remote countries.

778
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,943
It happened right here, in Europe,
in ex-Yugoslavia.

779
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,182
It was very shocking.

780
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,705
A bus coming from Krajina
through Croatia...

781
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,346
a person was killed through that hole.

782
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:57,425
The Croats killed lots of people too
as they left Krajina.

783
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,989
Violence was everywhere.

784
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:03,507
But what disgusted me most...

785
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:07,426
was to see how contagious hatred was.

786
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,064
These people too saw violence.

787
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,471
Entire families...

788
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,027
the whole Serbian population
of Krajina was expelled.

789
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,630
And overnight, they found themselves...

790
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:24,785
evicted from their homes,
looking for a place to go...

791
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,421
having their next-door neighbors
shooting at them.

792
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:46,150
These were refugee camps
not far from Tuzla...

793
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:49,869
in central Bosnia.

794
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:53,023
These families had left
the enclave of Zepa...

795
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:57,071
where Serbs
murdered thousands of young men.

796
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,782
We were there at the very moment
when the families were arriving...

797
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:05,471
in a state of great distress.

798
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,511
There were only women, old men...

799
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,700
and children.

800
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:24,950
The younger men
had all been held and murdered.

801
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,429
It was strange
that this was happening in Europe...

802
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,510
at the end of the 20th century.

803
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,545
From the cars alone...

804
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,591
you can see these people
had a standard of living...

805
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,947
a European standard of living...

806
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,910
a European intellectual level...

807
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,301
a European infrastructure.

808
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,269
And they lost everything.

809
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:00,231
Hundreds of kilometers,
crowded with people and cars.

810
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,264
We are a ferocious animal.

811
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,184
We humans are terrible animals.

812
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,466
Here in Europe, in Africa,
in South America, everywhere...

813
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,231
we are extremely violent.

814
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,347
Our history is a history of wars.

815
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,144
It's an endless story...

816
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,348
a story of repression...

817
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,104
a tale of madness.

818
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,950
The situation in Rwanda kept changing.

819
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:53,150
The Hutu army, which was ruling
the country, was defeated...

820
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,226
and retreated into the Congo,
to the Goma region.

821
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:03,182
First, the Tutsis had fled
the Hutu barbarity.

822
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,223
And then, the Hutus...

823
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,871
fled the Tutsi occupation.

824
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,068
So everybody fled, in turn.

825
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,149
In just a few days...

826
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,224
in July 1994...

827
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,665
the Goma region...

828
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,744
received more than 2 million people.

829
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,946
It was a disaster in the making.

830
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,864
Diseases such as cholera
started spreading...

831
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:36,150
and the people began to die like ants.

832
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:39,269
12 to 15 thousand died every day.

833
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,350
I was taking photos
of these piles of corpses...

834
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:48,944
when I saw the dad coming with his kid.

835
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,545
He threw him on the pile...

836
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,989
and left with his friend,
chatting as if nothing had happened.

837
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,823
They couldn't bury all the people.

838
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,903
So a bulldozer came from the French army...

839
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,905
which took dozens at a time...

840
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,062
laid them out on the ground...

841
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,871
and covered them with earth.

842
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:36,030
Everybody should see these images...

843
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,024
to see how terrible our species is.

844
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,982
Orphan kids, who were on the road.

845
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,385
Three children...

846
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,107
the two with the livelier eyes
would live.

847
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:59,185
The one whose eyes are clouded was dying.

848
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,864
When I got out of there, I was ill...

849
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:07,511
my body was very sick.

850
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:11,301
I didn't have any infectious diseases...

851
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,348
but my soul was sick.

852
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:21,305
I went back to Rwanda
one year after the disaster...

853
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:26,625
to cover the return of the Hutus
who'd been in the Congo...

854
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,310
and had nowhere to go.

855
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,908
The United Nations
started forcing them to return.

856
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:47,064
You felt the whole planet
was covered with refugee tents.

857
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,342
After working there...

858
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:06,028
the Tutsi authorities
suggested that I should see...

859
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:10,025
a few of the places
where the massacres had occurred.

860
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:21,621
People had fled to a church,
believing they'd be safe.

861
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,821
All murdered!

862
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,940
Here, it happened in a school.

863
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:37,867
You can still see what was written
on the blackboard that day.

864
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,028
It was terrifying.

865
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:57,224
The people who had left Rwanda,
about 2 million refugees...

866
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,985
some went back to Rwanda...

867
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,791
but others were afraid of the repression.

868
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:07,991
So a column of about 250,000 people
left the city of Goma...

869
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,347
and entered the Congo forest.

870
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,746
We lost track of them.

871
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:17,825
Everybody knew
there were 250,000 lost people.

872
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,863
Nobody knew where they were.

873
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,468
Six months later...

874
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,662
they started appearing near Kisangani,
in the center of the Congo.

875
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:34,746
They'd lived in the forest for 6 months.

876
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:41,026
So the UN took me there.

877
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,383
There was a train and I took it.

878
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,908
It was dropping off food,
then heading back.

879
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,903
But I said, "I'm staying."

880
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:01,580
I spent three days with these people,
who kept arriving.

881
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,271
Columns and columns of them...

882
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:10,142
To think that when they left
they were 250,000...

883
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:13,269
and only 40,000 made it here!

884
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:17,061
210,000 people were missing!

885
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:28,831
Yet at the same time, life went on.

886
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:33,110
A guy cutting hair...

887
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,820
Or even this Congolese guy...

888
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,749
with his calculator...

889
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,823
who was trying to collect...

890
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:45,945
the few dollars
he was sure people had on them...

891
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,820
which he was trying to exchange,
in the middle of nowhere!

892
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,949
In the middle of a remote forest.

893
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,261
At that time...

894
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:05,502
the pro-Tutsi guerilla movement
that had seized Kisangani...

895
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,265
began to expel these people again...

896
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,865
to send them back.

897
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:14,389
Six months to get there,
and now back to Rwanda!

898
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,667
They began to kill some of them.

899
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:21,984
There, I met people
who just couldn't take any more.

900
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:25,670
Who started to be delirious...

901
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:26,748
losing their minds...

902
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,345
They were driven mad.

903
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,301
In fact, those people who were expelled...

904
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,827
were never heard from again.

905
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,660
I believe they were all murdered.

906
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:55,790
That was my last trip,
that disastrous time in Rwanda.

907
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,382
When I left there...

908
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:07,821
I no longer believed in anything,
in any salvation for the human species.

909
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,631
You couldn't survive such a thing.

910
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,509
We didn't deserve to live.

911
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,543
No one deserved to live.

912
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:28,701
How many times did I lay my cameras down
to cry over what I'd seen?

913
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:37,701
<i>Sebastião had seen
into the heart of darkness</i>

914
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,231
<i>and deeply questioned his work
as a social photographer</i>

915
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,951
<i>and a witness of the human condition.</i>

916
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:49,222
<i>What was left for him to do after Rwanda?</i>

917
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,065
<i>In that time,
my grandfather's health had worsened.</i>

918
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:05,271
<i>My parents had to return to Brazil
to take care of the farm.</i>

919
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,666
<i>It was nothing but a wasteland.</i>

920
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:11,266
<i>They didn't know what to do with it.</i>

921
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,224
<i>The birds, the alligators
and the majestic forests were gone.</i>

922
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:20,350
<i>There was nothing left
from Sebastião's childhood memories.</i>

923
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,587
<i>And then Lélia came up
with a surprising idea.</i>

924
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,989
<i>"Why don't we replant the forest
that was here before?"</i>

925
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:38,187
<i>The forest that was there before
and had once spread over all these hills</i>

926
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:42,106
<i>was Mata Atlântica, the Atlantic rain forest.</i>

927
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,906
<i>Nobody had ever tried to replant it,</i>

928
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:48,348
<i>let alone on a scale of 600 hectares.</i>

929
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,742
<i>Lélia's suggestion was probably
driven by the impulse</i>

930
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:55,221
<i>of lifting up the family spirit.</i>

931
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,190
<i>Yet, they actually started doing it.</i>

932
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:01,426
<i>And in the following 10 years,</i>

933
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:06,028
<i>nothing else than a full-blown miracle
took place on this land</i>

934
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,468
<i>that has since then become
the lnstituto Terra.</i>

935
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,343
I remember, during the first plantation...

936
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:22,425
I sometimes dreamt
that everything had died.

937
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:28,264
Because the soil was so bad here,
so damaged...

938
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:31,389
that I asked myself, "Will it ever grow?"

939
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:35,264
The Mata Atlântica
has 400 different species.

940
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,264
Of course,
we don't have all 400 of them...

941
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,661
but each time, we plant...

942
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:41,821
it's 100 species...

943
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,265
150 species...

944
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:47,470
After the first planting we lost 60%.

945
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,344
After the second, we lost 40%.

946
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,742
We had no book to teach us how to replant...

947
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,390
a Mata Atlântica.

948
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,463
I love coming up here...

949
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:18,984
to see all these trees together...

950
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:21,381
this mass of green forest.

951
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:26,590
You can imagine
what it took to plant all these trees.

952
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,303
When I was a kid...

953
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,951
we had a little waterfall.

954
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,870
All year long, it cascaded down there.

955
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,423
My sisters and I would walk here
to the waterfall, for picnics.

956
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:46,390
There was still an enormous forest.

957
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,507
Later...

958
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:51,542
the forest was cut down
and the water vanished.

959
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:55,988
Our forest is still young,
it needs a lot of water.

960
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:02,309
But in 10, 15 years,
when this growth has stabilized...

961
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,430
I'm sure we'll have
a beautiful waterfall once more.

962
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:27,621
You can see...

963
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,827
lots of little paths...

964
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,141
hundreds of them...

965
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,949
That's where the cows walk.

966
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:41,229
Each cow's hoof,
as it touches the ground...

967
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,747
presses down with 200 or 250 kilos
on one small space.

968
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:48,302
The soil flattens, it dries out...

969
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,462
and nothing grows on it anymore.

970
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,669
It's interesting to see the difference...

971
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:58,068
between what the lnstituto Terra
was before, meadows like that...

972
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:01,747
and what it is today,
a completely rebuilt eco-system...

973
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,982
with our 2 million trees.

974
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,431
Here you can see...

975
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:30,710
a cicada that sang until it died.

976
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:35,421
I'm sure its body
wasn't enclosed in the tree like that.

977
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:38,261
The termites have built around it,
assimilated it.

978
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:40,382
It'll be buried in there.

979
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:54,387
You look at a tree and you think only
of its verticality, its beauty...

980
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:59,785
But everything depends on the tree,
our water, our oxygen...

981
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,982
It's everyone's home.

982
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:04,269
Ants, small insects, cicadas...

983
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:05,910
they're all in there.

984
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:11,782
It feels good to hold
a tree you've helped to plant.

985
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:15,501
It's already deeply rooted,
firm in the ground...

986
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:19,062
Thirty years from now, it'll be like this.

987
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,144
It's still quite young, still growing.

988
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:25,503
These are even younger ones, tiny ones.

989
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,548
Maybe they sprouted last night...

990
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:31,668
like Alice entering Wonderland.

991
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:37,270
It's incredible that they'll become trees
40 meters or so high...

992
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:40,264
and will live for 400 or 500 years.

993
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,710
What power!

994
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,869
To think that these three-month-old trees...

995
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,420
will reach their apex in 400 years.

996
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:59,262
Perhaps from there we could try to grasp...

997
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,621
the concept of eternity.

998
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:04,021
Maybe eternity is measurable.

999
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:08,904
When I first said, "Let's plant a forest"...

1000
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:14,020
I thought that from a seed
I'd grow a small tree, a small plant...

1001
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:17,303
Well, this isn't one small plant,
it's a million!

1002
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,384
And it's not only for here.

1003
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:24,306
It's for the whole region,
and further each time.

1004
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:27,708
What's wonderful is that an idea...

1005
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,021
can develop and grow.

1006
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:34,542
And it's no longer one person's idea,
it's everyone's.

1007
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:39,986
Our technology
can be reproduced almost everywhere.

1008
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,427
Of course, species differ.

1009
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,231
But the know-how is the same...

1010
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,743
for every tropical forest.

1011
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:03,387
<i>The land healed Sebastião's despair.</i>

1012
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:06,270
<i>The joy of seeing the trees grow again,</i>

1013
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:08,422
<i>the springs coming back to life,</i>

1014
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:14,143
<i>it all jump-started Sebastião's calling
as a photographer once more.</i>

1015
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,826
<i>Only that he and Lelia knew
they couldn't possibly</i>

1016
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,665
<i>return to what they'd done before.</i>

1017
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,469
We came to the conclusion...

1018
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,386
that I could do a new project
related to the environment.

1019
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,709
Of course, I first thought...

1020
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:30,624
of denouncing
the destruction of the forests...

1021
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,306
or the pollution of the oceans...

1022
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:34,381
whatever.

1023
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:38,226
Then we thought
we'd do a different sort of project.

1024
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,227
We'd pay a tribute to the planet.

1025
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,031
And we were very surprised to discover...

1026
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,104
that almost half of the planet is still...

1027
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,660
like at the time of creation.

1028
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:55,908
Many of my friends said,
"No, you shouldn't take that route.

1029
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:59,701
"It's risky. You're known
as a social photographer...

1030
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:03,626
"And you're venturing into the field...

1031
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:06,671
"of landscape, or wildlife photography."

1032
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:09,141
I said, "I don't care, let's do it!

1033
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,781
"L have to learn
to photograph that as well."

1034
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,908
And I started my first story.

1035
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:18,024
I wanted it to be Galapagos.

1036
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:22,424
I wanted to understand
what Darwin had understood.

1037
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,503
The same species...

1038
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,823
in very different ecosystems...

1039
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:30,341
will evolve very differently.

1040
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:35,943
Looking at this detail of an iguana's paw...

1041
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,467
I can't help thinking...

1042
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,703
of the hand of a medieval knight...

1043
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:46,421
with those metallic scales to protect him.

1044
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:50,783
Looking at the paw's bone structure...

1045
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:54,467
I see that the iguana is also my cousin.

1046
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:57,911
That we came from the same cell.

1047
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:05,425
When you're in front
of a creature of that age...

1048
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,502
you're facing a real authority...

1049
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:10,265
with all those wrinkles,
all that knowledge.

1050
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,710
When Darwin came here...

1051
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:16,149
that turtle
would already have been an adult.

1052
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:18,427
Maybe it saw Darwin.
Who knows?

1053
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,431
One day I was very tired...

1054
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:28,904
as we'd been walking a long time
across some lava fields.

1055
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,982
I lay down on the beach to rest...

1056
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,983
and I felt something touch my leg.

1057
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,109
I looked and it was a sea lion.

1058
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:39,182
Another one came up beside us.

1059
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,627
We were three sea lions!

1060
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:46,311
They didn't see man as a predator,
nor as a threat.

1061
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:51,704
That was my first nature report...

1062
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:54,989
the first time
I photographed other animals.

1063
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,340
For eight years,
I took my time observing.

1064
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:05,108
The main thing was to understand...

1065
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:09,191
that I'm as much a part of nature
as a turtle, or a tree...

1066
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,750
or a pebble.

1067
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,782
Amazing how he looks at us...

1068
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,624
Indeed“.

1069
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,068
There's depth in there!

1070
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,144
He was coming closer,
I was photographing him...

1071
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,745
his hand in his mouth...

1072
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,941
He was seeing himself in a mirror
for the first time...

1073
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,704
the front of the lens.

1074
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,790
He was taking his finger out,
putting it back...

1075
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:46,544
realizing that it was him.

1076
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:51,831
He was becoming aware of his image,
and I sensed total identification.

1077
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,622
They are families like ours...

1078
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,749
with grandfathers, fathers,
grandchildren.

1079
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:16,742
They respect each other.

1080
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:20,542
And when you visit them,
you have to be polite...

1081
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:23,266
to stand in a certain way...

1082
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:26,150
you have to respect their territory.

1083
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,621
And then you're welcomed.

1084
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,827
I also befriended a whale.

1085
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:40,187
These are whales...

1086
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:42,145
in Argentina.

1087
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:48,387
An adult like this is 35 meters long,
weighs about 40 tons.

1088
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:51,947
She came so close to the boat...

1089
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,222
I could touch her.

1090
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,031
And it was incredible.
Such sensitive skin!

1091
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,704
As I was caressing her...

1092
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:03,229
I could see her tail, 35 meters away,
trembling.

1093
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,904
Incredible sensitivity.

1094
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:08,864
We had a small boat, just <i>7</i> meters long.

1095
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:12,111
She knew she could have sunk us.

1096
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:15,024
But she never once hit the boat. Not once!

1097
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,229
As we left,
she began tapping her tail...

1098
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,381
That's like another planet!

1099
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:04,781
It's quite incredible.

1100
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:09,548
Let me see if I have another photo
of the Nenets.

1101
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:13,745
See, everything a Nenet owns is here.

1102
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:16,511
That's their house.

1103
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:24,781
I'd been planning this work
on the Nenets for a long time.

1104
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:30,064
About eighteen people,
with six thousand reindeer...

1105
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:32,302
constantly migrating.

1106
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,583
This must be
about seven in the evening.

1107
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,789
At about eight in the evening
they'd light a fire...

1108
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,625
and cook the only hot meal of the day.

1109
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,987
After the meal, we'd chat a bit.
Everybody talked.

1110
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,585
They'd put out the fire.

1111
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:54,667
While the fire was burning,
it was 15 to 20 degrees, quite nice.

1112
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:57,306
Two hours later, it was minus thirty.

1113
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,942
They're the real cowboys of Siberia.

1114
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:05,751
They always have their lasso...

1115
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:08,949
made of reindeer skin,
around their necks.

1116
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:14,707
They have boots made of silver-fox skin.

1117
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:19,022
They sleep with them.
Those boots last a lifetime.

1118
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,622
The Ob is a very special river...

1119
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,543
a huge Siberian river.

1120
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:43,181
At this spot,
it's about 47 kilometers wide.

1121
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:49,350
Once past the Ob,
you're in the Arctic Circle.

1122
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:53,986
There's no horizon, there's nothing.

1123
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:58,588
You are on a white plate,
as wide as the universe.

1124
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,582
<i>Genesis took Sebastião</i>

1125
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:15,665
<i>around the globe once more
for almost a decade.</i>

1126
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:20,507
<i>It was gonna show us nature,
animals, places and peoples</i>

1127
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:23,504
<i>that were like at the beginning of time.</i>

1128
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,503
<i>A much more optimistic view</i>

1129
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:28,868
<i>of the same planet
than Sebastião had witnessed for so long</i>

1130
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,988
<i>as damaged and destroyed.</i>

1131
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:36,946
<i>Genesis was gonna be their opus magnus,</i>
a <i>love letter to the planet.</i>

1132
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:55,830
There were accounts of the Zo'é
in 16th-century Jesuit writings.

1133
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:58,382
They went to Amazonia
and spoke about these people...

1134
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:01,543
who wore a tube of wood
inside their lower lip.

1135
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:04,942
These Indians were never seen again.

1136
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,466
It was believed to be a fairytale...

1137
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:09,907
or an invention by the Jesuits...

1138
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:12,460
until the end of the eighties...

1139
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:15,231
when these Indians
were contacted again.

1140
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,267
These Indians really live in a paradise.

1141
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,741
It's the only place I've found...

1142
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:49,983
where the women
have 3 or 4 or 5 husbands...

1143
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:52,151
and the husbands have as many wives.

1144
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:55,422
Each woman has a hunting husband...

1145
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:58,068
a fishing husband...

1146
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:01,189
a farming husband...

1147
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:06,109
one who's a handyman,
who helps around the house...

1148
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,627
The women have enormous power.

1149
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:12,546
They have an influence over
some of the men...

1150
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:14,270
that's quite considerable.

1151
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:49,389
One thing I always found interesting
about all these peoples...

1152
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:53,181
was their perfect consciousness
of their appearance.

1153
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:56,261
When I was about to take a photo...

1154
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:00,345
they'd know I was going to make
a representation of their image.

1155
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:03,662
At first they'd be eager,
then, they'd lose interest.

1156
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:07,347
It wasn't their world.

1157
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:10,947
On the other hand,
they were very interested in my knife.

1158
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:15,748
My friend Ypô made me swear
to give him my knife.

1159
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:18,505
But the National Indian Foundation...

1160
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:22,187
made me promise not to give
any of my objects to the Indians...

1161
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:24,503
to protect their purity.

1162
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,581
So he said, "Let's make a deal.

1163
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,668
"They day you leave...

1164
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:32,391
"throw your knife
out of the airplane window.

1165
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:34,940
"I'll follow the plane's path...

1166
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:36,909
"and I'll find your knife!"

1167
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:56,786
These plants are very old.

1168
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:59,591
They've been here for 40 or 50 years.

1169
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:06,267
They're wonderful plants...

1170
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:08,905
samambaia.

1171
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:12,269
A plant of the shade,
from the heart of our forest...

1172
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,581
from the highest parts.

1173
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:18,221
It reminds me of my mother's hair.

1174
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,065
My mother was very beautiful.

1175
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:26,471
These were her plants,
and after she died...

1176
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:30,464
Dad took care of them
until he passed away.

1177
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,429
Then, we brought them here.

1178
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:39,662
Look, it's raining.

1179
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,026
Beautiful rain.

1180
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:01,782
This land is extremely important to us.

1181
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:05,948
We're completing a cycle with this land.

1182
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:10,421
Within this cycle,
we have spent our lives.

1183
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,343
The lives of my parents...

1184
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:15,549
the lives of my sisters...

1185
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:18,305
a large part of my life...

1186
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:22,941
And today,
we're living our lives here again...

1187
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:24,624
Lélia and I.

1188
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:28,067
This land continues to tell our story.

1189
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:32,190
It formed my childhood
and accompanies my old age.

1190
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,911
And when I die...

1191
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:39,747
this forest will once again be
like when I was born.

1192
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:41,391
And the cycle will be complete.

1193
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,142
It's the story of my life.

1194
01:40:05,474 --> 01:40:08,431
The man whose photographs have told us

1195
01:40:08,557 --> 01:40:10,640
thousands of stories about our planet,

1196
01:40:10,766 --> 01:40:12,973
It leaves us a great history and a great dream:

1197
01:40:13,099 --> 01:40:15,181
the destruction of nature can be reversed.

1198
01:40:18,266 --> 01:40:23,057
More than a thousand fountains watering again "Terra Institute".

1199
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:26,431
There are already planted 2.5 million trees.

1200
01:40:26,557 --> 01:40:28,098
The wildlife has returned, even jaguars.

1201
01:40:30,141 --> 01:40:33,432
The earth is no longer possession of Salgado,

1202
01:40:33,558 --> 01:40:35,849
now a national park that belongs to everyone.

1203
01:40:35,975 --> 01:40:39,974
Is the demonstration that devastated lands anywhere

1204
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,307
they can return to forest.
