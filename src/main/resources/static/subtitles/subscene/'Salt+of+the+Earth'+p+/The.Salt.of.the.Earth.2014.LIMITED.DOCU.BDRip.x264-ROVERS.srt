1
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:54,115
The Serra-Pelada, Brazil's gold mine...

2
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,700
there before me!

3
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:01,623
When I reached the edge
of that enormous hole...

4
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:05,001
every hair on my body stood on end.

5
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:09,214
I'd never seen anything like it.

6
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:14,761
Here, in a split second,
I saw unfolding before me...

7
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,846
the history of mankind...

8
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,099
The building of the pyramids...

9
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:21,976
the Tower of Babel...

10
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,937
the mines of King Solomon...

11
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,316
Not the sound of
a single machine could be heard.

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,110
All you could hear...

13
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,783
was the babble of
50,000 people in one huge hole.

14
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,663
Conversations, noises, human sounds...

15
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,624
mingled with the sounds of manual labor...

16
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:48,670
I had returned to the dawn of time.

17
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:54,425
I could almost hear the gold whispering
in the souls of these men.

18
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,775
All this earth had to be removed.

19
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,443
It's not all gold.

20
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:16,698
The guys had to climb small ladders...

21
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,075
leading to bigger ones...

22
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,785
to emerge at the top.

23
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,674
You wouldn't want to fall down there!

24
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:41,139
If you fell from the top
you'd risk taking others with you.

25
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,978
I'd climb up several times a day...

26
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,397
but I never thought I'd fall.

27
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,816
Nobody else fell.

28
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:56,654
You were there to carry sacks, not to fall.
And in my case, to take photos.

29
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:06,664
These guys climbed it
50 or 60 times a day.

30
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,504
The only way
to get down such a slope...

31
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,214
is by running.

32
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,092
If you stop, you fall.

33
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:31,522
All these men together
formed an extremely organized world...

34
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,067
but in complete madness.

35
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,917
You get the impression they're slaves...

36
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,378
but there wasn't a single slave.

37
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:57,757
They were only slaves
to the idea of getting rich.

38
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,259
Everybody wanted to get rich.

39
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:07,725
There were all sorts:
intellectuals, university graduates...

40
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,561
farm employees...

41
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,356
urban workers...

42
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,776
People from all walks of life
were trying their luck.

43
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:22,949
Because when you'd hit a vein of gold...

44
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:28,371
everyone working
that little section of the mine...

45
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,332
had the right to choose one sack.

46
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,627
And in that sack that they chose...

47
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,921
- and this is the slavery aspect-

48
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:41,092
there might be nothing
or a kilo of gold!

49
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,304
At that very moment
one's freedom was at stake.

50
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:51,227
Men who come into contact with gold...

51
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,937
can never leave it.

52
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:53,891
If you put too many photographers
in one place...

53
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,978
they'll all take very different pictures.

54
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:01,607
Because they necessarily come...

55
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:05,653
from very diverse places.

56
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:09,532
Each one forms their way of seeing...

57
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,995
according to their history.

58
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,040
I feel that in my case...

59
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:23,004
I learned to shape my way of seeing
here, in this place.

60
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,091
Here I have an idea of the planet.

61
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,679
I'd go for long walks with my father...

62
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:33,598
across this farm.

63
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,933
We'd come here to look.

64
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:45,318
Behind each mountain there's a story,
there's something to see.

65
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,494
I'd dream a lot here.

66
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,124
I wanted to go beyond the mountains,
I wanted to know.

67
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,643
Sebastião was such a rascal!

68
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,062
He was always traveling...

69
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,273
like no one I'd ever seen.

70
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,486
My dad was the same, he never stopped.

71
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,405
Back and forth, like a shuttle.

72
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,616
Just like Sebastião.

73
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:47,036
You'd think he was in Vitória,
but he'd already be here...

74
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,581
or up north doing politics.

75
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:56,170
Without his fellow students
he wouldn't have finished his studies.

76
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,091
Tiao was a scamp
when it came to studying.

77
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,970
He was a handful, but he managed
to get his economics degree.

78
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:10,059
I wanted him to be a lawyer.

79
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,352
He did one year...

80
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:15,523
then switched to economics,
which was good for him.

81
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,224
- Wim, I have a nice shot of you.
- And I got one of you!

82
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,726
I bet you did!

83
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,189
Look...

84
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,379
These were
my first photographs.

85
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,382
We were in the city of Tahoua.

86
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,344
Young mothers were standing in line...

87
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,472
to get some food...

88
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:27,686
as there'd been a severe drought
in Niger in '73.

89
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:32,858
For Lélia it was tough,
because she was pregnant.

90
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:36,653
I remember, we were in that very place...

91
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,157
living at a friend's home at Niamey...

92
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,702
when the local Marabout came by.

93
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:47,789
Lélia was wearing shorts,
she was really pretty.

94
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,461
And the Marabout sat down...

95
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,546
and said to her...

96
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,007
"Come sit on my lap!"

97
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,801
"Oh," I said...

98
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:03,847
"Mr. Marabout, there's a slight problem...

99
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:07,684
This woman is pregnant...

100
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,062
with our first child.

101
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,357
So it's best she stays put."

102
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:17,194
So he understood that...

103
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:22,950
it wasn't the right synchronicity.

104
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,453
So we talked it over
and he left with a kilo of sugar...

105
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,206
as happy as if it'd been Lélia.

106
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:33,270
Ever since we'd left Brazil in 1969...

107
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:37,649
I'd deeply missed South America.

108
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,277
So I decided to travel...

109
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,696
around Brazil's neighboring countries:

110
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,283
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia...

111
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,872
I dreamt of seeing the mountains
of South America...

112
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,290
the Andes.

113
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,376
At the time, in South America...

114
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,213
there was a profound social movement...

115
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,966
the "Liberation Theology".

116
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:09,056
And on this journey
I met a young priest, in Ecuador...

117
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,974
called Gabicho.

118
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:15,604
We were both young,
I a photographer, he a priest.

119
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,482
He brought them the word of God...

120
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:24,488
he organized the farmers into cooperatives,
introduced solidarity.

121
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:28,450
And since he had access
to all these communities...

122
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,870
those journeys I made were extraordinary.

123
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,086
There we were, over 3,000 meters up.

124
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:44,257
We'd climb 600 or 700 meters in a day.

125
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:49,262
It was a sheer delight
to live in this landscape...

126
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,014
among these communities.

127
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:58,688
These are the Saraguros,
a tribe of Indians in the south of Ecuador.

128
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:03,860
Very religious, but also great drinkers.

129
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:09,199
Over half of them, at the weekend,
men and women...

130
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,451
would get totally drunk.

131
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,581
The villager on the left...

132
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:20,127
his name is Lupe, Guadalupe...

133
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,880
Lupe and I became very close.

134
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,717
At the time I had very long hair...

135
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,719
long blond hair...

136
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:33,014
with a big, reddish blond beard.

137
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:38,186
Walking with him through the mountains...

138
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,940
one day he said to me, "Listen, Sebastião.

139
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:45,026
I know that you were sent from heaven."

140
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,989
According to the Saraguros' legends...

141
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:52,909
God, in the image of Christ...

142
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:57,497
was to return to Earth to observe them...

143
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:00,208
to decide who'd go to heaven.

144
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:05,964
As we walked in the mountains,
he told me about his life.

145
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:13,054
He seriously believed that I'd come
as a special observer...

146
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:16,892
to report "up there"
about their behavior.

147
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,901
Never in my life had I met a people...

148
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:29,487
with such a different sense of time.

149
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:36,369
The time I spent with the Saraguros
felt like an entire century...

150
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,705
everything felt so slow.

151
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,792
It was another way of thinking,
a different rhythm.

152
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,298
There was a fatalism on their faces.

153
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,888
This is in the state of Oaxaca, in Mexico.

154
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,475
A group of farmers called the Mixe.

155
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:05,106
It's all medieval, the yoke, the plow...

156
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,779
This is deepest South America.

157
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,242
They were a country people...

158
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,412
but what mattered most to them...

159
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,872
was music.

160
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,251
They were people who adored music.

161
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:30,465
Every member of the community
able to play an instrument...

162
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,468
didn't have to do any work...

163
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,679
they worked as musicians.

164
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,645
They had me sleep for several days...

165
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:47,732
in a very cold cement room...

166
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:51,945
to see if I could bear it,
if I really wanted to stay...

167
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:54,948
As I held out for quite a while...

168
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:58,076
they finally put me up in a house...

169
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,162
and I grew much closer to the community.

170
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,872
It was a pleasure for me.

171
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,710
We became close friends,
I felt good there.

172
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,805
This is in the north of Mexico.
The Tarahumara.

173
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:23,852
These people are great runners,
long-distance runners.

174
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:25,729
They don't walk, they run.

175
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:29,232
God, it was hell trying to keep up.

176
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:32,068
They didn't walk, they flew!

177
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,245
That's a Tarahumara...

178
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,708
his face deeply marked by life.

179
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,756
Beautiful hair, fantastic hair.

180
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,595
People would approach my camera...

181
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:02,932
and I had the impression
I was more a sound recorder.

182
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:08,646
They'd tell me things
as if I was recording their stories.

183
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:19,282
The power of a portrait
lies in that fraction of a second...

184
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:24,329
when you catch a glimpse
of that person's life.

185
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:28,249
The eyes say a lot,
the expression on the face...

186
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,297
When you take a portrait,
the shot is not yours alone.

187
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,716
The person offers it to you.

188
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,182
Those journeys meant so much to me.

189
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:51,523
To come here after all those years,
unable to set foot in my own country.

190
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:55,985
The essence was the same.
It was my continent, we were so close.

191
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,232
Goddamn bear!

192
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,858
He tricked us.

193
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:44,821
He drove them all into the water.
Incredible!

194
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,361
What do you think?

195
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,323
What do you think, Dad?

196
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:32,201
I think it'll be complicated
to get this story.

197
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,624
If this is all we've got...

198
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:59,145
It's not just a matter of getting close
to a bear and taking a picture.

199
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,898
If the framing is poor...

200
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:05,902
you'll just show the bear,
but it won't be a photo.

201
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,447
This spot is no good.

202
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,241
There's nothing in the background...

203
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:15,620
nothing to compose a well-framed picture.

204
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,461
No action, nothing.

205
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,052
Stunning!

206
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:03,556
All I could see
was the shape of their tusks.

207
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,018
Impossible to make out
the outline of their heads.

208
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:09,854
It was like being in Dante's Inferno...

209
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,064
with those tusks protruding...

210
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,483
All those shapes... Incredible!

211
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,258
Dad, what happened in 1979?

212
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:46,515
In '79, Lélia was pregnant
with our second son.

213
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,851
We knew it was a boy.

214
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,980
When Rodrigo was born...

215
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:57,568
he had all the signs of Down's syndrome.

216
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:02,281
He was so cute with his slanted eyes...

217
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:06,327
I felt he was completely normal.

218
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,204
So did Lélia.

219
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:15,127
The doctor did a lot of tests.
It was three weeks before we knew.

220
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,380
On the day he called...

221
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,467
the tension was such...

222
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,136
that when I heard the results, I cried.

223
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,263
I couldn't stop crying.

224
00:39:56,812 --> 00:40:00,608
It was December 31,
I'd returned to Brazil!

225
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,694
It was great to be home...

226
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:07,490
after ten and a half years abroad.

227
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:13,037
It was a shock.
Lélia's hometown wasn't the same.

228
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:17,458
Vitória had changed a lot.
Everything was different.

229
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,170
My region had changed a lot too.

230
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:26,759
When I left my parents,
they were young and strong.

231
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:31,263
Upon returning, I found an old man.
My father had aged a lot.

232
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:33,516
But at that time...

233
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,019
I wanted to explore Brazil more deeply.

234
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,064
My sister lent me a car...

235
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:44,693
and I made a six-month journey
in the North-East of Brazil.

236
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:46,862
I didn't know the North-East.

237
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:50,282
I'd always dreamt of that part of Brazil.

238
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,850
These people were going to a funeral.

239
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,729
I stopped by the roadside
and went with them.

240
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:28,070
Infant mortality was very high
in the North-East of Brazil.

241
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:31,073
These children died
before they were baptized.

242
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:37,037
They believe that children
who are not baptized...

243
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,833
don't have the right to go to heaven.

244
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:44,003
They stay in an in-between realm...

245
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:45,588
called limbo.

246
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:52,094
If a child dies with its eyes closed
it's because it was baptized.

247
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,888
If its eyes are open...

248
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:57,433
they leave them open
so it can find its way.

249
00:41:57,558 --> 00:42:01,562
Otherwise it will wander for eternity.

250
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:14,950
Back then, there was a service
for renting coffins at the church.

251
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,453
You could rent a coffin cheaply.

252
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,207
It'd be used dozens of times.

253
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:31,800
There you can see
such a coffin rental service.

254
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:37,348
And yes, those are shoes.

255
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:41,977
They sold everything:
shoes, coffins, bananas, vegetables...

256
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:44,688
ice-cream, everything...

257
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:50,736
It's a region
where life and death are very close.

258
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:59,286
Here's a group saying prayers...

259
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:02,623
and learning about politics
at the same time.

260
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,211
In Brazil there was, and still is...

261
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:10,464
a big movement
called the "Landless Workers".

262
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:15,177
Many of them came from here...

263
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,555
from the North-East of Brazil.

264
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:26,522
These people...

265
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:29,525
have a moral strength...

266
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:32,486
a physical force...

267
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:36,490
even though they're frail and eat poorly.

268
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,370
Look how arid this region is.

269
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:46,166
It's like a piece of the Sahel in Brazil.

270
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,630
Here, on the road...

271
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:54,550
people are leaving, never to return.

272
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:58,137
Sometimes it's so dry,
so difficult here...

273
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,973
that people migrate
to the southern cities.

274
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:04,184
For them it's over,
they abandon the land.

275
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,505
For many years now...

276
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:37,968
we've been suffering
from a lack of rain.

277
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:53,150
There were a lot of cattle here before...

278
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:55,486
but they're all gone now.

279
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:58,447
There have been severe droughts.

280
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,242
The pastures are gone,
it doesn't pay anymore.

281
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,120
Why has it gone, Grandfather?

282
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:07,498
Because of the drought.

283
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,129
We replanted,
but there's not a blade of grass left.

284
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,256
It wasn't that long ago.

285
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,218
Your dad and I...

286
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:22,304
we spent more than 20,000.

287
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:23,931
Where did it go?

288
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,976
This land was so plentiful.

289
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:33,315
There were lots of birds...

290
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:36,652
canaries and ticoticos...

291
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,279
blackbirds...

292
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:44,535
There used to be a great forest
on that hill...

293
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:48,330
and another forest over that hill.

294
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:52,209
There has been a lot of erosion.

295
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,169
The hills are now barren.

296
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:56,797
When it rains...

297
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,551
there's nothing to hold back the water.

298
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:02,678
It's a disaster.

299
00:46:03,554 --> 00:46:05,639
I have no idea...

300
00:46:06,223 --> 00:46:09,143
how to stop it.

301
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:20,946
Grandpa, were you happy on this farm?

302
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,030
Sorry?

303
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:24,700
Were you happy here?

304
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:28,328
Was I happy?

305
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:31,373
I was, because I was able
to provide an education...

306
00:46:31,457 --> 00:46:34,626
for my seven daughters...

307
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,087
and Sebastião.

308
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:40,382
I raised my children,
it was tough...

309
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:42,050
but I'm happy I did it.

310
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:49,391
I earned 100,000 from the woods alone...

311
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:51,727
to put the children through school.

312
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,562
They were all brought up well...

313
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:57,065
well fed, properly dressed...

314
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:11,265
I worked in Ethiopia in 1984...

315
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:17,062
and continued across the Sahel
in '85 and '86.

316
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:20,983
I spent almost two years in that region...

317
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:24,528
reporting on the famine.

318
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,075
There were refugee camps...

319
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:33,287
the largest ever seen in human history.

320
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:36,748
And I really wanted to show that.

321
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:41,003
To show that a large part of humanity...

322
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:44,089
was suffering from great distress...

323
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:47,843
due to a problem of sharing...

324
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:51,805
and not just a natural disaster.

325
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:57,394
This was a Coptic region.

326
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,648
They are very strict Christians,
the Northern Ethiopians.

327
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:04,401
They have great humility.

328
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:07,195
Even with a dying child...

329
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:09,990
they wouldn't get in front of others.

330
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:11,450
They'd rather wait.

331
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,667
Look at the state of the people.

332
00:49:23,337 --> 00:49:26,214
At that stage, they've no strength left.

333
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:30,886
They say people die of famine.

334
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:34,556
Famine weakens the body...

335
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:37,559
but it's the parallel diseases that kill.

336
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:44,149
When you catch cholera,
the dehydration is so fast...

337
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:48,820
that you lose 12 liters of water
a day from diarrhea.

338
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:51,573
You die in two or three days.

339
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:58,747
Such young faces...

340
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:03,502
aged from so much suffering.

341
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:07,589
If you look at his forehead,
he's not an old man.

342
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:10,801
What's old about him
is the emptiness in his eyes.

343
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:14,888
Look how young she is,
look at their baby!

344
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:16,973
He's her husband.

345
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:23,980
Most deaths were at night...

346
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:25,440
from the cold.

347
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:33,031
Dying here
was really a continuation of life.

348
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:34,950
The people were used to dying.

349
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:40,288
A husband is washing his wife to bury her.

350
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:48,130
In his mountain clothes, his goat skin...

351
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:53,885
A very young woman.

352
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,893
In the Coptic ritual...

353
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:05,981
the body has to be clean
when it comes before God.

354
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:09,192
You have to wash it all over...

355
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,279
even if there's very little water.

356
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:19,703
With each dying person
a piece of everyone else dies.

357
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:31,673
A father is preparing his son for burial...

358
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:34,176
saying his last goodbye.

359
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:40,348
Family members usually prepare their dead.

360
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,150
Knowing that a government...

361
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:55,113
is withholding food from its people...

362
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:58,200
as was the actual case here...

363
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:01,161
in this camp in Northern Ethiopia...

364
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:05,624
That was brutal political dishonesty.

365
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:25,185
I returned to Ethiopia
at the end of 1984.

366
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:30,273
The guerillas knew the government
was about to drive these people out...

367
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:33,568
so they started evacuating people
towards Sudan.

368
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,988
They left from all over Tigray.

369
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,620
We were attacked by two helicopters.

370
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:47,499
Mi-24s.
Very fast combat helicopters.

371
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:50,085
They shot at the people with machine-guns.

372
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:53,964
I took a photo and then I ran.

373
00:52:58,093 --> 00:53:00,345
There were many pregnant women...

374
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:05,976
hoping that when they'd arrive
they'd find food and water.

375
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,812
That they'd finally reach
the promised land.

376
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:15,318
I must have spent...

377
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,488
at least two months there.

378
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:21,366
And when I arrived in Sudan...

379
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,786
I did a lot of work
on the arrival of these people.

380
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,585
This man had come from Ethiopia.

381
00:53:31,668 --> 00:53:34,963
His camel had reached its limit.
Maybe it was dead.

382
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:37,632
But the man was holding on and on...

383
00:53:37,716 --> 00:53:40,760
Yet when he reached the doctors,
his child was dead.

384
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:44,723
After such a long march.

385
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:56,484
Doctors Without Borders
had to give up this camp.

386
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,946
Water is essential in these camps...

387
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,865
and it had become a huge problem.

388
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:05,160
So they had to move the camp
as fast as possible.

389
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:13,877
People were crammed into UN trucks...

390
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,339
to take them to a new camp...

391
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:20,884
on a beautiful and fertile piece of land...

392
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:23,511
on the banks of the Blue Nile.

393
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:28,016
I rode on this truck
for at least 300 or 400 kilometers.

394
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:34,773
These are two friends...

395
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:39,069
pretending it was
a normal Sunday afternoon...

396
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:42,197
sitting under a tree, telling stories...

397
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:51,498
There's lots of water by the Nile,
but that's where the people died...

398
00:54:52,207 --> 00:54:53,500
because...

399
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:56,086
There was nothing to eat.

400
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:59,047
They were in the final stages
of their distress.

401
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:07,138
They'd forgotten to bring food,
or hadn't been able to.

402
00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:10,100
The food distribution had gone wrong.

403
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:12,435
These people had held on so long...

404
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:15,355
but when they got there,
they could no more.

405
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,910
I went to Mali.

406
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,580
There was a severe drought there too.

407
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:37,502
The skin becomes like tree bark...

408
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:41,548
like a tree marked by the desert wind...

409
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:45,301
by sandstorm after sandstorm...

410
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:57,647
There were only women and kids.

411
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:00,442
The men had left to work in Libya...

412
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:05,613
or headed for the Ivory Coast,
looking for work...

413
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:09,659
promising to return
and bring food for the family.

414
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:11,995
But very few came back.

415
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:24,549
They were all saved...

416
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:27,552
because Doctors Without Borders
did great work.

417
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:30,972
They brought assistance
to this whole area.

418
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:37,145
This is a friend, Luc, a Belgian doctor.

419
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:42,776
Measuring a kid, weighing him.

420
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:48,907
In two or three weeks
these children completely recover.

421
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,534
They're marked by it, all their lives...

422
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:55,497
having experienced
such deprivation while growing up.

423
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:03,588
This boy was alone...

424
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,925
with his instrument,
his little guitar, in his hand...

425
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:10,762
With his rag of a shirt
still hanging on him.

426
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,680
No trousers, nothing.

427
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:17,936
Look at his determination, his posture.

428
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:21,523
He knew where he was going.

429
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:25,652
Looking for other groups,
looking for a village...

430
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:28,279
with his dog...

431
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:30,865
A boy of eight or nine.

432
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:22,417
I wanted to pay homage...

433
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:27,088
to all the men and women
who built the world around us.

434
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:30,258
An archeology of the industrial era.

435
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:03,309
As soon as I saw the first images on

436
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:06,437
I felt the urge to cover this story.

437
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,859
It was like working in a huge theater.

438
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:15,029
500 oil wells burning.

439
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:18,324
A giant stage, the size of the planet.

440
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:23,162
No restrictions,
you could go where you wanted.

441
01:00:25,707 --> 01:00:29,877
There was a discharge
of heavy oil smoke.

442
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,716
The smoke was so dense,
the sun couldn't cut through.

443
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:42,056
There were days
when it was dark for 24 hours straight.

444
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,481
Once a fire was put out...

445
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:53,526
the earth was still very hot.

446
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:57,739
They had to pour a huge amount
of water on to cool it.

447
01:00:57,822 --> 01:01:02,035
If not, the oil would just re-ignite.

448
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,663
But despite that...

449
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:09,083
there'd sometimes be an explosion,
like a cannon shot.

450
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:13,338
The noise was so deafening...

451
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:16,424
it was like working next to a jet engine.

452
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,094
Now I'm a little deaf.

453
01:01:20,595 --> 01:01:22,597
That's where my deafness began.

454
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:40,948
These are Canadians...

455
01:01:41,032 --> 01:01:43,451
a unit of firefighters from Calgary.

456
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:47,872
They'd brought a beautiful red truck.

457
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:51,459
And it was their rule,
once they'd put out a fire...

458
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:54,712
to wash the truck every evening.

459
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:58,174
And in the morning
it'd be covered in oil again.

460
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,973
A hellish job!

461
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:12,730
I put off my departure
at least 2 or 3 times...

462
01:02:12,814 --> 01:02:15,108
until I really had to leave.

463
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:18,486
But it broke my heart...

464
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:22,240
to abandon this vast spectacle.

465
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:26,244
I roamed around.

466
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,080
And very close to the end...

467
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:33,084
we were driving by this long wall...

468
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:37,004
- That day I was with a journalist
from <i>The New York Times</i> -

469
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:42,093
Since it was a no-man's-land,
ruined by war...

470
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,095
we broke down the gate.

471
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:45,555
And inside...

472
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:48,933
we found a sort of...

473
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,518
paradise...

474
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,687
that had turned into hell.

475
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:57,358
It was a garden
belonging to the Kuwaiti royal family...

476
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:01,821
with horses, thoroughbreds...

477
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:05,533
that had gone completely,
desperately insane.

478
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:10,455
Animals are the first
to flee from a catastrophe...

479
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:12,582
when they're free to leave.

480
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:15,251
But here, they weren't.

481
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:19,672
There were birds there too,
it was an oasis...

482
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,924
very well irrigated.

483
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:27,388
Birds who couldn't fly anymore
as their feathers were stuck together.

484
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,395
The Kuwaitis fled
when they felt the disaster approaching...

485
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:38,316
leaving behind the imprisoned animals...

486
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:42,028
and the Bedouins
whom they didn't really consider as humans.

487
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:20,334
I was doing my project
on the displacement of peoples...

488
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:22,420
in 1994...

489
01:05:23,004 --> 01:05:26,340
when the president of Rwanda...

490
01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:28,884
his plane was shot down.

491
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:32,972
That started a huge exodus
towards Tanzania...

492
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:37,184
due to the brutal repression
of the Tutsis in Rwanda.

493
01:05:39,729 --> 01:05:42,690
I was one of the first to arrive there.

494
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:45,943
The catastrophe was everywhere.

495
01:05:46,027 --> 01:05:48,571
People were fleeing to Burundi...

496
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:51,032
to the Congo, to Uganda...

497
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:53,367
They were leaving in all directions.

498
01:05:57,204 --> 01:06:01,083
The roads were already full of people...

499
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,631
People sleeping by the roadsides...

500
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:10,551
carrying all their belongings on bicycles...

501
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:13,596
fleeing with whatever they could take.

502
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:18,184
We headed in the opposite direction...

503
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:21,520
towards the border.

504
01:06:21,604 --> 01:06:24,398
There was no border control whatsoever.

505
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:28,277
I entered Rwanda, and it was terrifying.

506
01:06:28,903 --> 01:06:32,698
The number of dead bodies
I saw on that road...

507
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,912
Here, a grenade had exploded.

508
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:42,291
Those not killed by the grenade
were killed with machetes.

509
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:47,421
There, I began to sense...

510
01:06:47,505 --> 01:06:51,092
the sheer scale of the disaster
I was witnessing.

511
01:06:52,093 --> 01:06:54,470
A genocide was in progress here.

512
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:02,853
It was 150 kilometers by road to Kigali...

513
01:07:02,937 --> 01:07:05,398
150 kilometers of dead bodies...

514
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:17,493
I turned back,
because my story was about people.

515
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:21,747
I was doing my book on refugees,
I was working on <i>Exodus.</i>

516
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:24,542
I started going into the camps...

517
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,293
and I began to see...

518
01:07:26,419 --> 01:07:30,172
the sheer number of people
leaving Rwanda.

519
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:35,219
Hell was taking the place of paradise.

520
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,723
It was frightening...

521
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:42,435
to see, on such a beautiful savanna...

522
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:45,646
this mega city springing up.

523
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:51,652
Within days,
there were almost a million people here.

524
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:02,872
Among all this distress,
one thing that really moved me...

525
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:06,417
was the relationship
between this mother and her child...

526
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,171
and the child's trust in its mother.

527
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:25,144
Violence...

528
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,521
and brutality...

529
01:08:27,605 --> 01:08:30,983
are not the monopoly...

530
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:33,110
of remote countries.

531
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:36,447
It happened right here, in Europe,
in ex-Yugoslavia.

532
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,699
It was very shocking.

533
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:45,206
A bus coming from Krajina
through Croatia...

534
01:08:46,415 --> 01:08:48,834
a person was killed through that hole.

535
01:08:48,918 --> 01:08:52,922
The Croats killed lots of people too
as they left Krajina.

536
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:55,466
Violence was everywhere.

537
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:59,011
But what disgusted me most...

538
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:02,932
was to see how contagious hatred was.

539
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:06,560
These people too saw violence.

540
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:07,978
Entire families...

541
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:11,524
the whole Serbian population
of Krajina was expelled.

542
01:09:14,235 --> 01:09:17,112
And overnight, they found themselves...

543
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:21,283
evicted from their homes,
looking for a place to go...

544
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:24,912
having their next-door neighbors
shooting at them.

545
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:43,639
These were refugee camps
not far from Tuzla...

546
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:47,351
in central Bosnia.

547
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:50,521
These families had left
the enclave of Zepa...

548
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:54,567
where Serbs
murdered thousands of young men.

549
01:09:55,568 --> 01:10:00,281
We were there at the very moment
when the families were arriving...

550
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:03,951
in a state of great distress.

551
01:10:15,296 --> 01:10:18,007
There were only women, old men...

552
01:10:18,966 --> 01:10:20,217
and children.

553
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:24,430
The younger men
had all been held and murdered.

554
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:33,939
It was strange
that this was happening in Europe...

555
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:36,984
at the end of the 20th century.

556
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:39,028
From the cars alone...

557
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:43,073
you can see these people
had a standard of living...

558
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:45,451
a European standard of living...

559
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:48,412
a European intellectual level...

560
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:50,789
a European infrastructure.

561
01:10:50,873 --> 01:10:52,750
And they lost everything.

562
01:10:56,837 --> 01:11:00,716
Hundreds of kilometers,
crowded with people and cars.

563
01:11:05,012 --> 01:11:06,764
We are a ferocious animal.

564
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:09,683
We humans are terrible animals.

565
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:14,980
Here in Europe, in Africa,
in South America, everywhere...

566
01:11:15,064 --> 01:11:17,733
we are extremely violent.

567
01:11:24,657 --> 01:11:26,825
Our history is a history of wars.

568
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,626
It's an endless story...

569
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:37,836
a story of repression...

570
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,588
a tale of madness.

571
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:51,433
The situation in Rwanda kept changing.

572
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:55,646
The Hutu army, which was ruling
the country, was defeated...

573
01:11:55,729 --> 01:12:00,734
and retreated into the Congo,
to the Goma region.

574
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:06,699
First, the Tutsis had fled
the Hutu barbarity.

575
01:12:06,782 --> 01:12:08,701
And then, the Hutus...

576
01:12:08,784 --> 01:12:11,370
fled the Tutsi occupation.

577
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:13,580
So everybody fled, in turn.

578
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,627
In just a few days...

579
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:21,714
in July 1994...

580
01:12:21,797 --> 01:12:23,173
the Goma region...

581
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:26,260
received more than 2 million people.

582
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:30,431
It was a disaster in the making.

583
01:12:33,434 --> 01:12:36,353
Diseases such as cholera
started spreading...

584
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:40,649
and the people began to die like ants.

585
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:43,777
12 to 15 thousand died every day.

586
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:50,826
I was taking photos
of these piles of corpses...

587
01:12:51,452 --> 01:12:54,455
when I saw the dad coming with his kid.

588
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:56,040
He threw him on the pile...

589
01:12:56,123 --> 01:13:00,461
and left with his friend,
chatting as if nothing had happened.

590
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:10,304
They couldn't bury all the people.

591
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:14,391
So a bulldozer came from the French army...

592
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:18,395
which took dozens at a time...

593
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:20,564
laid them out on the ground...

594
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:23,358
and covered them with earth.

595
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:43,504
Everybody should see these images...

596
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:46,507
to see how terrible our species is.

597
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,475
Orphan kids, who were on the road.

598
01:13:58,435 --> 01:13:59,895
Three children...

599
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,607
the two with the livelier eyes
would live.

600
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:07,694
The one whose eyes are clouded was dying.

601
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:13,367
When I got out of there, I was ill...

602
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,994
my body was very sick.

603
01:14:16,078 --> 01:14:19,790
I didn't have any infectious diseases...

604
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:21,834
but my soul was sick.

605
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:30,801
I went back to Rwanda
one year after the disaster...

606
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:36,140
to cover the return of the Hutus
who'd been in the Congo...

607
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:37,808
and had nowhere to go.

608
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:42,396
The United Nations
started forcing them to return.

609
01:14:53,407 --> 01:14:57,578
You felt the whole planet
was covered with refugee tents.

610
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:12,843
After working there...

611
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:17,514
the Tutsi authorities
suggested that I should see...

612
01:15:17,598 --> 01:15:21,518
a few of the places
where the massacres had occurred.

613
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:33,113
People had fled to a church,
believing they'd be safe.

614
01:15:33,906 --> 01:15:36,325
All murdered!

615
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:45,459
Here, it happened in a school.

616
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:50,380
You can still see what was written
on the blackboard that clay.

617
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:52,507
It was terrifying.

618
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,734
The people who had left Rwanda,
about 2 million refugees...

619
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:13,487
some went back to Rwanda...

620
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:16,281
but others were afraid of the repression.

621
01:16:16,365 --> 01:16:21,495
So a column of about 250,000 people
left the city of Goma...

622
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:23,830
and entered the Congo forest.

623
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:28,252
We lost track of them.

624
01:16:28,335 --> 01:16:32,339
Everybody knew
there were 250,000 lost people.

625
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:34,341
Nobody knew where they were.

626
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,971
Six months later...

627
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:44,142
they started appearing near Kisangani,
in the center of the Congo.

628
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:50,232
They'd lived in the forest for 6 months.

629
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:56,530
So the UN took me there.

630
01:16:57,781 --> 01:17:00,867
There was a train and I took it.

631
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:05,414
It was dropping off food,
then heading back.

632
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,416
But I said, "I'm staying."

633
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:18,093
I spent three days with these people,
who kept arriving.

634
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:20,762
Columns and columns of them...

635
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:26,643
To think that when they left
they were 250,000...

636
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:29,771
and only 40,000 made it here!

637
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:33,567
210,000 people were missing!

638
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:46,330
Yet at the same time, life went on.

639
01:17:46,413 --> 01:17:50,584
A guy cutting hair...

640
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:54,338
Or even this Congolese guy...

641
01:17:54,421 --> 01:17:56,256
with his calculator...

642
01:17:57,257 --> 01:18:00,302
who was trying to collect...

643
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:04,431
the few dollars
he was sure people had on them...

644
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:08,310
which he was trying to exchange,
in the middle of nowhere!

645
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:11,438
In the middle of a remote forest.

646
01:18:18,612 --> 01:18:19,780
At that time...

647
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:24,993
the pro-Tutsi guerilla movement
that had seized Kisangani...

648
01:18:25,077 --> 01:18:27,746
began to expel these people again...

649
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,373
to send them back.

650
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:33,877
Six months to get there,
and now back to Rwanda!

651
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,171
They began to kill some of them.

652
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:41,468
There, I met people
who just couldn't take any more.

653
01:18:42,344 --> 01:18:45,180
Who started to be delirious...

654
01:18:45,263 --> 01:18:47,224
losing their minds...

655
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:48,850
They were driven mad.

656
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:57,818
In fact, those people who were expelled...

657
01:18:57,943 --> 01:19:00,320
were never heard from again.

658
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:04,157
I believe they were all murdered.

659
01:19:11,915 --> 01:19:17,295
That was my last trip,
that disastrous time in Rwanda.

660
01:19:20,882 --> 01:19:22,884
When I left there...

661
01:19:24,511 --> 01:19:29,307
I no longer believed in anything,
in any salvation for the human species.

662
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:32,102
You couldn't survive such a thing.

663
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:34,020
We didn't deserve to live.

664
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:36,022
No one deserved to live.

665
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:51,204
How many times did I lay my cameras down
to cry over what I'd seen?

666
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:45,860
I remember, during the first plantation...

667
01:21:45,986 --> 01:21:49,906
I sometimes dreamt
that everything had died.

668
01:21:51,533 --> 01:21:55,745
Because the soil was so bad here,
so damaged...

669
01:21:55,829 --> 01:21:58,873
that I asked myself, "Will it ever grow?"

670
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:03,753
The Mata Atlântica
has 400 different species.

671
01:22:03,837 --> 01:22:06,756
Of course,
we don't have all 400 of them...

672
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,175
but each time, we plant...

673
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:10,302
it's 100 species...

674
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:11,761
150 species...

675
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:15,974
After the first planting we lost 60%.

676
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:19,853
After the second, we lost 40%.

677
01:22:19,936 --> 01:22:23,231
We had no book to teach us how to replant...

678
01:22:23,315 --> 01:22:24,899
a Mata Atlântica.

679
01:22:44,044 --> 01:22:45,962
I love coming up here...

680
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,466
to see all these trees together...

681
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:51,885
this mass of green forest.

682
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:57,098
You can imagine
what it took to plant all these trees.

683
01:23:00,894 --> 01:23:02,812
When I was a kid...

684
01:23:02,896 --> 01:23:05,440
we had a little waterfall.

685
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:09,361
All year long, it cascaded down there.

686
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:13,907
My sisters and I would walk here
to the waterfall, for picnics.

687
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:17,869
There was still an enormous forest.

688
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:18,995
Later...

689
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:23,041
the forest was cut down
and the water vanished.

690
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:27,462
Our forest is still young,
it needs a lot of water.

691
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:33,802
But in 10, 15 years,
when this growth has stabilized...

692
01:23:33,885 --> 01:23:37,931
I'm sure we'll have
a beautiful waterfall once more.

693
01:23:59,953 --> 01:24:01,121
You can see...

694
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:04,332
lots of little paths...

695
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:06,626
hundreds of them...

696
01:24:07,544 --> 01:24:09,421
That's where the cows walk.

697
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:14,718
Each cow's hoof,
as it touches the ground...

698
01:24:14,801 --> 01:24:18,221
presses down with 200 or 250 kilos
on one small space.

699
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,808
The soil flattens, it dries out...

700
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:23,977
and nothing grows on it anymore.

701
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,147
It's interesting to see the difference...

702
01:24:27,897 --> 01:24:32,569
between what the Instituto Terra
was before, meadows like that...

703
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:36,239
and what it is today,
a completely rebuilt eco-system...

704
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:38,491
with our 2 million trees.

705
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:01,931
Here you can see...

706
01:25:02,015 --> 01:25:06,186
a cicada that sang until it died.

707
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:10,940
I'm sure its body
wasn't enclosed in the tree like that.

708
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:14,778
The termites have built around it,
assimilated it.

709
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:16,863
It'll be buried in there.

710
01:25:26,122 --> 01:25:30,877
You look at a tree and you think only
of its verticality, its beauty...

711
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:36,299
But everything depends on the tree,
our water, our oxygen...

712
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:38,468
It's everyone's home.

713
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,763
Ants, small insects, cicadas...

714
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:43,389
they're all in there.

715
01:25:44,557 --> 01:25:49,270
It feels good to hold
a tree you've helped to plant.

716
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:52,982
It's already deeply rooted,
firm in the ground...

717
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:56,569
Thirty years from now, it'll be like this.

718
01:25:56,653 --> 01:25:59,656
It's still quite young, still growing.

719
01:26:00,824 --> 01:26:03,993
These are even younger ones, tiny ones.

720
01:26:04,077 --> 01:26:06,037
Maybe they sprouted last night...

721
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:10,166
like Alice entering Wonderland.

722
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:15,755
It's incredible that they'll become trees
40 meters or so high...

723
01:26:15,839 --> 01:26:18,758
and will live for 400 or 500 years.

724
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:21,219
What power!

725
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:30,353
To think that these three-month-old trees...

726
01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:32,939
will reach their apex in 400 years.

727
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:38,778
Perhaps from there we could try to grasp...

728
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:41,114
the concept of eternity.

729
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:43,533
Maybe eternity is measurable.

730
01:26:46,578 --> 01:26:49,414
When I first said, "Let's plant a forest"...

731
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:54,502
I thought that from a seed
I'd grow a small tree, a small plant...

732
01:26:54,627 --> 01:26:57,797
Well, this isn't one small plant,
it's a million!

733
01:26:59,299 --> 01:27:00,884
And it's not only for here.

734
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:04,804
It's for the whole region,
and further each time.

735
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:08,182
What's wonderful is that an idea...

736
01:27:10,268 --> 01:27:12,520
can develop and grow.

737
01:27:12,645 --> 01:27:16,024
And it's no longer one person's idea,
it's everyone's.

738
01:27:17,734 --> 01:27:21,487
Our technology
can be reproduced almost everywhere.

739
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:23,907
Of course, species differ.

740
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:26,701
But the know-how is the same...

741
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,245
for every tropical forest.

742
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:03,947
We came to the conclusion...

743
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:07,867
that I could do a new project
related to the environment.

744
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:11,204
Of course, I first thought...

745
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:14,123
of denouncing
the destruction of the forests...

746
01:28:14,207 --> 01:28:16,793
or the pollution of the oceans...

747
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:17,877
whatever.

748
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:21,714
Then we thought
we'd do a different sort of project.

749
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:24,717
We'd pay a tribute to the planet.

750
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,512
And we were very surprised to discover...

751
01:28:27,595 --> 01:28:30,598
that almost half of the planet is still...

752
01:28:30,682 --> 01:28:33,142
like at the time of creation.

753
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:40,400
Many of my friends said,
"No, you shouldn't take that route.

754
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:44,195
"It's risky. You're known
as a social photographer...

755
01:28:44,278 --> 01:28:48,116
"And you're venturing into the field...

756
01:28:48,199 --> 01:28:52,161
"of landscape, or wildlife photography."

757
01:28:52,245 --> 01:28:54,622
I said, "I don't care, let's do it!

758
01:28:54,706 --> 01:28:58,292
"I have to learn
to photograph that as well."

759
01:28:58,376 --> 01:29:00,420
And I started my first story.

760
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:03,506
I wanted it to be Galapagos.

761
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:07,927
I wanted to understand
what Darwin had understood.

762
01:29:09,178 --> 01:29:11,014
The same species...

763
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:14,308
in very different ecosystems...

764
01:29:14,434 --> 01:29:16,853
will evolve very differently.

765
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:22,442
Looking at this detail of an iguana's paw...

766
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:25,945
I can't help thinking...

767
01:29:26,029 --> 01:29:29,198
of the hand of a medieval knight...

768
01:29:29,282 --> 01:29:32,910
with those metallic scales to protect him.

769
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:38,291
Looking at the paw's bone structure...

770
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:41,961
I see that the iguana is also my cousin.

771
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:45,381
That we came from the same cell.

772
01:29:48,843 --> 01:29:52,930
When you're in front
of a creature of that age...

773
01:29:53,014 --> 01:29:55,016
you're facing a real authority...

774
01:29:55,099 --> 01:29:57,769
with all those wrinkles,
all that knowledge.

775
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:00,188
When Darwin came here...

776
01:30:00,271 --> 01:30:04,650
that turtle
would already have been an adult.

777
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:06,903
Maybe it saw Darwin.
Who knows?

778
01:30:09,197 --> 01:30:11,908
One day I was very tired...

779
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:17,413
as we'd been walking a long time
across some lava fields.

780
01:30:17,497 --> 01:30:19,499
I lay down on the beach to rest...

781
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:23,461
and I felt something touch my leg.

782
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:26,589
I looked and it was a sea lion.

783
01:30:26,672 --> 01:30:28,674
Another one came up beside us.

784
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:31,135
We were three sea lions!

785
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:35,807
They didn't see man as a predator,
nor as a threat.

786
01:30:38,184 --> 01:30:41,187
That was my first nature report...

787
01:30:41,354 --> 01:30:44,482
the first time
I photographed other animals.

788
01:30:48,027 --> 01:30:51,823
For eight years,
I took my time observing.

789
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:55,618
The main thing was to understand...

790
01:30:55,701 --> 01:30:59,664
that I'm as much a part of nature
as a turtle, or a tree...

791
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:01,249
or a pebble.

792
01:32:18,284 --> 01:32:20,286
Amazing how he looks at us...

793
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:22,121
Indeed...

794
01:32:23,456 --> 01:32:25,541
There's depth in there!

795
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:28,628
He was coming closer,
I was photographing him...

796
01:32:28,711 --> 01:32:30,254
his hand in his mouth...

797
01:32:30,796 --> 01:32:34,425
He was seeing himself in a mirror
for the first time...

798
01:32:34,508 --> 01:32:36,219
the front of the lens.

799
01:32:36,302 --> 01:32:39,263
He was taking his finger out,
putting it back...

800
01:32:39,347 --> 01:32:41,057
realizing that it was him.

801
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:46,312
He was becoming aware of his image,
and I sensed total identification.

802
01:33:01,035 --> 01:33:03,120
They are families like ours...

803
01:33:03,204 --> 01:33:06,249
with grandfathers, fathers,
grandchildren.

804
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:12,255
They respect each other.

805
01:33:12,338 --> 01:33:17,051
And when you visit them,
you have to be polite...

806
01:33:17,176 --> 01:33:19,762
to stand in a certain way...

807
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:22,640
you have to respect their territory.

808
01:33:22,723 --> 01:33:25,101
And then you're welcomed.

809
01:33:26,811 --> 01:33:30,314
I also befriended a whale.

810
01:33:34,402 --> 01:33:36,696
These are whales...

811
01:33:38,281 --> 01:33:39,657
in Argentina.

812
01:33:42,285 --> 01:33:45,871
An adult like this is 35 meters long,
weighs about 40 tons.

813
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:49,458
She came so close to the boat...

814
01:33:49,542 --> 01:33:51,711
I could touch her.

815
01:33:51,794 --> 01:33:54,505
And it was incredible.
Such sensitive skin!

816
01:33:54,588 --> 01:33:56,215
As I was caressing her...

817
01:33:56,299 --> 01:34:00,720
I could see her tail, 35 meters away,
trembling.

818
01:34:00,803 --> 01:34:02,388
Incredible sensitivity.

819
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:07,351
We had a small boat, just 7> meters long.

820
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:10,604
She knew she could have sunk us.

821
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:13,524
But she never once hit the boat. Not once!

822
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:16,736
As we left,
she began tapping her tail...

823
01:35:00,571 --> 01:35:02,865
That's like another planet!

824
01:35:02,948 --> 01:35:05,284
It's quite incredible.

825
01:35:05,368 --> 01:35:10,039
Let me see if I have another photo
of the Nenets.

826
01:35:11,332 --> 01:35:15,252
See, everything a Nenet owns is here.

827
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:18,005
That's their house.

828
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:26,263
I'd been planning this work
on the Nenets for a long time.

829
01:35:27,306 --> 01:35:31,560
About eighteen people,
with six thousand reindeer...

830
01:35:31,644 --> 01:35:33,813
constantly migrating.

831
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:39,068
This must be
about seven in the evening.

832
01:35:39,151 --> 01:35:42,279
At about eight in the evening
they'd light a fire...

833
01:35:42,363 --> 01:35:45,116
and cook the only hot meal of the day.

834
01:35:46,033 --> 01:35:49,495
After the meal, we'd chat a bit.
Everybody talked.

835
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:51,080
They'd put out the fire.

836
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:57,169
While the fire was burning,
it was 15 to 20 degrees, quite nice.

837
01:35:57,294 --> 01:35:59,797
Two hours later, it was minus thirty.

838
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:06,429
They're the real cowboys of Siberia.

839
01:36:06,512 --> 01:36:09,223
They always have their lasso...

840
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:12,435
made of reindeer skin,
around their necks.

841
01:36:13,352 --> 01:36:18,190
They have boots made of silver-fox skin.

842
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:22,528
They sleep with them.
Those boots last a lifetime.

843
01:36:37,793 --> 01:36:41,130
The Ob is a very special river...

844
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:43,048
a huge Siberian river.

845
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:47,678
At this spot,
it's about 47 kilometers wide.

846
01:36:50,723 --> 01:36:54,852
Once past the Ob,
you're in the Arctic Circle.

847
01:36:56,896 --> 01:36:59,482
There's no horizon, there's nothing.

848
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:04,069
You are on a white plate,
as wide as the universe.

849
01:37:57,790 --> 01:38:03,337
There were accounts of the Zo'é
in 16th-century Jesuit writings.

850
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:06,882
They went to Amazonia
and spoke about these people...

851
01:38:06,966 --> 01:38:10,052
who wore a tube of wood
inside their lower lip.

852
01:38:10,135 --> 01:38:13,430
These Indians were never seen again.

853
01:38:13,514 --> 01:38:15,975
It was believed to be a fairytale...

854
01:38:16,058 --> 01:38:18,394
or an invention by the Jesuits...

855
01:38:18,477 --> 01:38:20,980
until the end of the eighties...

856
01:38:21,063 --> 01:38:23,732
when these Indians
were contacted again.

857
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:55,741
These Indians really live in a paradise.

858
01:39:56,909 --> 01:39:59,244
It's the only place I've found...

859
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:02,498
where the women
have 3 or 4 or 5 husbands...

860
01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:05,626
and the husbands have as many wives.

861
01:40:06,919 --> 01:40:08,921
Each woman has a hunting husband...

862
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:11,548
a fishing husband...

863
01:40:11,632 --> 01:40:14,677
a farming husband...

864
01:40:15,302 --> 01:40:19,598
one who's a handyman,
who helps around the house...

865
01:40:19,765 --> 01:40:22,101
The women have enormous power.

866
01:40:22,184 --> 01:40:26,021
They have an influence over
some of the men...

867
01:40:26,105 --> 01:40:27,773
that's quite considerable.

868
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:04,893
One thing I always found interesting
about all these peoples...

869
01:41:04,977 --> 01:41:08,689
was their perfect consciousness
of their appearance.

870
01:41:09,356 --> 01:41:11,775
When I was about to take a photo...

871
01:41:11,859 --> 01:41:15,821
they'd know I was going to make
a representation of their image.

872
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:20,159
At first they'd be eager,
then, they'd lose interest.

873
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:23,829
It wasn't their world.

874
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:27,458
On the other hand,
they were very interested in my knife.

875
01:41:27,541 --> 01:41:32,254
My friend Ypô made me swear
to give him my knife.

876
01:41:32,337 --> 01:41:35,007
But the National Indian Foundation...

877
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:38,677
made me promise not to give
any of my objects to the Indians...

878
01:41:38,761 --> 01:41:42,014
to protect their purity.

879
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:45,100
So he said, "Let's make a deal.

880
01:41:45,184 --> 01:41:47,144
"They day you leave...

881
01:41:47,227 --> 01:41:49,897
"throw your knife
out of the airplane window.

882
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:52,441
"I'll follow the plane's path...

883
01:41:52,524 --> 01:41:54,401
"and I'll find your knife!"

884
01:42:12,753 --> 01:42:15,297
These plants are very old.

885
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:18,091
They've been here for 40 or 50 years.

886
01:42:22,554 --> 01:42:24,765
They're wonderful plants...

887
01:42:25,891 --> 01:42:27,392
<i>samambaia.</i>

888
01:42:27,476 --> 01:42:31,772
A plant of the shade,
from the heart of our forest...

889
01:42:31,855 --> 01:42:34,066
from the highest parts.

890
01:42:35,484 --> 01:42:37,736
It reminds me of my mother's hair.

891
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:40,572
My mother was very beautiful.

892
01:42:43,242 --> 01:42:45,953
These were her plants,
and after she died...

893
01:42:47,037 --> 01:42:49,957
Dad took care of them
until he passed away.

894
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,917
Then, we brought them here.

895
01:42:58,173 --> 01:43:00,175
Look, it's raining.

896
01:43:00,259 --> 01:43:01,510
Beautiful rain.

897
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:23,282
This land is extremely important to us.

898
01:43:24,157 --> 01:43:27,452
We're completing a cycle with this land.

899
01:43:28,203 --> 01:43:31,915
Within this cycle,
we have spent our lives.

900
01:43:31,999 --> 01:43:33,834
The lives of my parents...

901
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:37,045
the lives of my sisters...

902
01:43:37,129 --> 01:43:39,798
a large part of my life...

903
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:45,429
And today,
we're living our lives here again...

904
01:43:45,512 --> 01:43:47,139
Lélia and I.

905
01:43:48,181 --> 01:43:50,559
This land continues to tell our story.

906
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:54,688
It formed my childhood
and accompanies my old age.

907
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:57,399
And when I die...

908
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:02,237
this forest will once again be
like when I was born.

909
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:04,865
And the cycle will be complete.

910
01:44:05,574 --> 01:44:07,659
It's the story of my life.
