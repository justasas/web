1
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:07,377
The entire tribe must not be endangered

2
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,898
because of the defiance of one person.

3
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,498
You must forget about him.

4
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,979
He was a wild spirit and this was always to be his fate.

5
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,819
You talk as if he's already dead

6
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:27,339
Even if he does survive this time, he's a greener

7
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,939
so set your sights elsewhere for a husband.

8
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,540
I'll never set my sights elsewhere.

9
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,301
-This is all the medicine I could find.
-I'm sorry.

10
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,261
The gods took your father in the night.

11
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:38,863
As long as we stay here, there'll never be enough to eat. Never.

12
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:43,063
There may be other places we could live where food is plentiful.

13
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:46,542
All it takes is one demon to follow you back from the forbidden land.

14
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,304
Then we'd all be struck down.

15
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:49,942
Have you ever seen one?

16
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,383
Have you?

17
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,463
Has anyone here ever seen one?

18
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:54,864
A demon?

19
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,384
A monster!

20
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:57,744
A beast!

21
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:02,625
The stories are true.

22
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,303
The gods used to live here.

23
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:09,625
They watched over and protected man, but man grew selfish

24
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,864
and cruel. So the gods left

25
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:14,465
allowing the demons to descend from the sky.

26
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:23,183
As survivors, we must dedicate our lives to pleasing the gods

27
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:27,024
so that one day they will come back and drive away the demons.

28
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:30,746
That is our fate.

29
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,705
Only if you believe in fate.

30
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:58,707
I'm sorry. I can't take you.

31
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:00,827
I can't handle myself as well as a man?

32
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:02,867
-No.
-You arrogant greener.

33
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,828
You can handle yourself better than most men

34
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:08,506
which is why you need to help the village.

35
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,948
Your mother gave this to me before she died.

36
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:19,349
She hoped it'd be passed to your children.

37
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:24,508
It's for good luck.

38
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:35,468
Don't let anything happen to you out there.

39
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,029
Easy!

40
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:24,791
Easy!

41
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:52,592
So you're the beast we're all afraid of.

42
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,473
Not a lot of meat on a dragon.

43
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:28,755
You have been fortunate in the hunt.

44
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:30,994
I hope you thanked the gods.

45
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,994
-A nonbeliever.
-I believe what I can see.

46
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:40,075
A nonbeliever, huh? You from the caves?

47
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,715
Probably never seen a god. Would you like to?

48
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:46,196
-What do you know about gods?
-We've seen gods. Rock and I.

49
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:47,916
You lying thieves.

50
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:52,996
Wait a minute.

51
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:55,636
Wait a minute, we're hunting.

52
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:57,836
No time to show you gods with no food.

53
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:01,436
We need food. We must hunt. Nonbeliever.

54
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,915
Wait.

55
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:16,357
First you show me the god.

56
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,599
Then we eat.

57
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:27,157
Look.

58
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,436
Frozen ones.

59
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:33,078
The way to the great god village is marked by these frozen ones.

60
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:37,198
When the gods left this world, they ordered man not to look at them.

61
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:41,197
Those that disobeyed were frozen in place for all of eternity.

62
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,357
When the gods lived here they could fly through the air.

63
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,878
They'd drive chariots in front of special caves with golden arches.

64
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:50,358
Golden.

65
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,039
And the food would magically appear.

66
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:54,279
Magic.

67
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:55,638
Here!

68
00:08:56,638 --> 00:09:00,719
The gods weren't allowed to fall in love with mortal women.

69
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,641
This one did

70
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,719
and was left behind, frozen as punishment.

71
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,160
Are you sure this was a god?

72
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,759
I thought you said you believe what you can see.

73
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,840
If you need proof

74
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,720
when the sun goes down, you can see the rest of the gods in the sky.

75
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,722
They're the bright lights.

76
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:36,762
The evil beasts hunt in the dark. We need to find shelter.

77
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,841
There's a cave over here.

78
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:47,881
Look at those poor bastards. They really angered the gods.

79
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:49,202
Carlo.

80
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,120
Let's eat.

81
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:07,002
Go. Go.

82
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,162
What's a "greener"?

83
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,443
The grass is greener on the other side.

84
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:29,605
Always looking for something better, something out there.

85
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:31,004
Maybe she was right.

86
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,242
God stone.

87
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:39,764
Sharp.

88
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,045
No, you keep it. You keep it.

89
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,004
Where we're from, a good woman is a hard thing to find.

90
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:50,444
So if you were stupid enough to leave a good woman behind

91
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:54,205
why don't you tell me where she is so I can go get her for myself?

92
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:55,364
No!

93
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:38,207
Forget about me. Get out of here. I can't move!

94
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:52,288
No!

95
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:57,928
Oh, heavenly gods!

96
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,456
Don't breathe the air!

97
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:35,936
It's poison!

98
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:42,657
My chest is on fire!

99
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,776
It helps you breathe. Take it!

100
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,217
I can't!

101
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:00,977
Get off my brother.

102
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,621
-What's he saying?
-Don't know.

103
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,506
Who's responsible for allowing him to run around?

104
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:33,546
He shot the wrangler.

105
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:41,505
I'm a little pressed for time. Save the going-away jokes for later.

106
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:43,585
No joke, sir. I swear.

107
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:46,186
The man-animal got a hold of this gun.

108
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,866
Really?

109
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:50,265
Show me.

110
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:52,026
Sir?

111
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:57,427
Reach for the gun.

112
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,267
But, sir, I might get shot.

113
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:02,707
Sure, you might. And I might suddenly grow a third arm!

114
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:04,187
But it shot the wrangler.

115
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:07,308
Any report filed today still has my name on it

116
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:11,107
and you are out of your skull-bone if you think I'm going to write

117
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:14,628
"shot by a man-animal" as the cause of death unless I see it!

118
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,147
If I obey your command, I may get killed.

119
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:19,948
If you don't, it's a certainty you will be killed.

120
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:22,029
Reach for the gun.

121
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:35,588
Well, I'll be damned.

122
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:57,514
Teleportation sequence activated.

123
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,593
Teleportation sequence activated.

124
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,155
It is a pleasure to see you, Your Excellency.

125
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:29,554
I would be honored to expedite your clearance through security.

126
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:33,035
Please, call me Zete. Does all of Earth look like this?

127
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm afraid so, sir.

128
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:40,035
Pathetic. All the green and the blue sky.

129
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:43,875
They told me this planet was ugly, but this is one of the ugliest

130
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,835
-in the entire universe.
-I couldn't agree more.

131
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:51,277
I hate these puny, undersized planets. The gravity is so different.

132
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:53,195
One does get used to it.

133
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:56,316
And the human-animals, grossly undersized.

134
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,876
They don't make good eating, Your Excellency.

135
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:01,357
-My executive assistant, Ker. -Thank you.

136
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:05,277
He has been fully trained to replace me as chief of security.

137
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:09,077
-As soon as my transfer goes through.
-Well, Ker

138
00:21:09,278 --> 00:21:12,516
once we finish mining out this miserable little planet

139
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,557
let's do the universe a favor.

140
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,077
Let's exterminate the lot of them.

141
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:22,237
-Oh, you're too much.
-So they tell me.

142
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:24,277
Please, come this way.

143
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:30,238
Spy satellites recorded those.

144
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:33,597
-What is this species?
-According to the Clinko historians

145
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:35,360
the species is called "dog."

146
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,238
-Dog.
-Yes.

147
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:40,799
Obviously the superior race, having the man-animal chauffeur.

148
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:45,639
Well, dogs did prove to be more cooperative than the man-animals.

149
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,918
They weren't as useful when it came to manual labor.

150
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:54,639
I am honored by your visit, Your Excellency.

151
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,958
Thank you, Planetship.

152
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,200
You'll be pleased. I approved additional labor resources.

153
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,679
They'll be here by the end of quarter cycle.

154
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,518
Thank you, Your Excellency.

155
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,679
Now, let's see.

156
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,919
Your long overdue transfer.

157
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:15,320
You must be looking forward to getting off this disgusting excuse of a planet.

158
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,480
I just want to do whatever serves the corporation best, sir.

159
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:22,320
Very admirable. And I must say, you've done

160
00:22:22,562 --> 00:22:25,360
a first-rate job here as interim security chief.

161
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,760
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

162
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:29,441
I do what I can.

163
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:32,562
So we've decided to keep you for another tour of service.

164
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,002
There must be some mistake.

165
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,882
Home Office does not make mistakes.

166
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:44,322
Of course not. But have you looked at my file?

167
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:48,202
It explicitly says that this is a temporary assignment.

168
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,283
Are you not aware that I graduated top of my class?

169
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:58,763
Quite an accomplishment.

170
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:02,002
I don't mean to second-guess the Home Office

171
00:23:02,203 --> 00:23:04,642
but surely I could be of better service--

172
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:09,443
Home Office is well aware of your academic achievements and talents.

173
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:13,923
That's why we've decided not to keep you here for another five cycles.

174
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:20,522
It's a joke.

175
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:23,883
Thank you, sir.

176
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:27,523
I don't know if I could've kept my sanity

177
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:29,603
to be here another five cycles.

178
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:33,485
We've decided to keep you here for another 50 cycles!

179
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:37,244
With endless options for renewal!

180
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,526
Those options, of course

181
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:06,045
being at Home Office's discretion.

182
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,446
Not yours.

183
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,645
The senator

184
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,285
has a lot of friends.

185
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,328
Would you please tell the senator

186
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:25,327
if I'd had even an inkling that that was his daughter--

187
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:26,966
Watch your tongue.

188
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:32,607
The senator's exact words to me were, and I'm quoting:

189
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:35,527
"If that blasted Terl tries to talk his way out of it

190
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,968
have him vaporized on the spot."

191
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:43,568
But cheer up. There's one bright side to this.

192
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:47,448
One day you're going to die, and when you end up in hell

193
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:50,768
at least it'll be a step up from this place.

194
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:47,052
You haven't left for Psychlo.

195
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:51,212
Your powers of observation are simply startling.

196
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,210
Give me three pans to go.

197
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:58,090
I don't know what you're so down about.

198
00:25:58,572 --> 00:26:00,652
You still get to be head of security.

199
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:05,613
Which, from what I can tell, is a pretty cushy job.

200
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,493
Well, I can assure you

201
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:13,451
that I was not groomed since birth to have some cushy job

202
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:16,452
that even a moron like you could perform.

203
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:20,612
While you were still learning how to spell your name

204
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:24,453
I was being trained to conquer galaxies!

205
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:27,732
To do anything less

206
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:30,934
is a disgrace to my entire family line.

207
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:33,853
That'll be six credits.

208
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:35,454
Put it on my tab.

209
00:26:35,654 --> 00:26:36,693
You don't have a tab.

210
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:38,454
I do now.

211
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,896
You're new here, so I'll explain how it works.

212
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:22,176
I eat first.

213
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:23,776
Then my men eat.

214
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:26,936
If there's anything left, you can share it with them.

215
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:29,177
That's how it used to work.

216
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,216
Greener, let's just stay alive.

217
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:33,417
You're right.

218
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:34,976
-So I'll fight you.
-No.

219
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:38,657
Without food, we don't have strength to escape.

220
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,296
-So now we're escaping?
-I am.

221
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:42,456
Come if you want.

222
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:48,497
We fight, it's to the death.

223
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:11,858
Say your prayers to the gods!

224
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,260
We have enough problems without killing each other over food.

225
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,340
From now on, we eat at the same time.

226
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,741
Sir.

227
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:31,302
I was wondering when you'd look at that.

228
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:36,223
It came in last week, and I put it right in your box.

229
00:29:39,063 --> 00:29:41,903
I've wasted my time, haven't I?

230
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,584
If you're going to lie to me, have the decency to do a credible job

231
00:29:47,783 --> 00:29:50,344
so I don't look like an idiot for training you.

232
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:54,543
But I'm not lying. I put the photo in your box as soon as it came in.

233
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:57,943
You are pathetic. You wouldn't last one day at the academy.

234
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,224
-And I saw you.
-What?

235
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:06,104
You said:

236
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,704
"We use picto-cameras to spy on other offices.

237
00:30:09,904 --> 00:30:13,825
But under no circumstance do we spy on our own office."

238
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,185
That's right. We don't. I do.

239
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,504
Start talking.

240
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,145
The photo's from last week's recon drone.

241
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:25,506
It shows a rockslide in the mountains. It exposed a gold vein.

242
00:30:25,705 --> 00:30:27,665
You were waiting for me to transfer

243
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:29,946
so you could turn it in and get credit.

244
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,426
I didn't think you'd mind.

245
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:34,505
I don't mind. Turn it in. But before you do, pretend you're not

246
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:37,305
a complete imbecile

247
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,066
and check the compo gradients.

248
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:45,066
It's full of uranium. No Psychlo

249
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,987
can get there without his breath gas exploding. No way to mine the gold.

250
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:57,546
But what I do mind is that you betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!

251
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:00,506
It's worthless! You said so!

252
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,066
But you didn't know it was worthless!

253
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,067
I would never hurt you, sir.

254
00:31:13,627 --> 00:31:18,308
I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me. It's against regulations, sir.

255
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:22,508
I can make this up to you, sir. I promise. I swear.

256
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:23,789
Please, sir.

257
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:28,987
You do not have to shoot me, sir.

258
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,788
Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?

259
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,349
Of course not. We have work to do. Come.

260
00:31:46,189 --> 00:31:49,950
Tomorrow morning, we must warn the Planetship of the mutiny.

261
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:51,109
What mutiny?

262
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,030
The one you're going to pretend is in the works

263
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:58,310
like your life depended on it. Because it does.

264
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,910
If the worker revolt takes place, my informants tell me

265
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,310
that the first order of business is to separate you from your head.

266
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,990
Which is why there will be no revolt.

267
00:32:11,191 --> 00:32:14,952
I am authorizing you to use whatever means necessary to prevent it.

268
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:19,632
The best way is to increase profits and stop cutting the workers' pay.

269
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,911
Production equals profits.

270
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:25,712
And I've already ordered as many new workers as possible

271
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,391
to boost production.

272
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:30,151
But we have to pay the new workers.

273
00:32:30,351 --> 00:32:35,071
Maybe you were absent the day they taught economics at the academy, Ker.

274
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,712
But nobody works for free.

275
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:39,792
Man-animals do.

276
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:44,193
What if we were to train them how to mine?

277
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,992
Man-animals operating machinery?

278
00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:55,152
Have you blown a head gasket?

279
00:32:55,593 --> 00:33:00,151
I will be the laughingstock of the universe.

280
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:02,514
So you should have me take man-animals

281
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:04,873
with equipment, out to a remote area

282
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:08,075
better that you don't know where, and try and train them.

283
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:11,073
Have them do some test mining.

284
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:13,793
If it doesn't work out, no one will know.

285
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,994
-Right.
-And if it does work

286
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:18,274
I will be vaporized.

287
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:20,154
It is against the law.

288
00:33:20,353 --> 00:33:21,514
Regulations say

289
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:25,755
a Planetship faced with a profit-threatening situation

290
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:29,116
is relieved of all other ordinances

291
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:33,515
to pursue, to protect and to acquire said profits.

292
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:34,795
There you have it.

293
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:44,594
We stick to the original plan.

294
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,836
Bring in new workers

295
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:50,714
and they go on half-pay as soon as they arrive.

296
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:53,677
And that is final!

297
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:57,000
Run! Run!

298
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:51,882
Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.

299
00:35:56,242 --> 00:35:59,123
Last time we didn't even stop timing until its lungs burst.

300
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:00,323
That's the wager.

301
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:10,283
No way this man-animal lasts more than four minutes.

302
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:33,685
Help me!

303
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:35,525
I need your air!

304
00:36:50,844 --> 00:36:52,966
The wager's off. The damn thing cheated.

305
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:03,127
The Planetship is hiding something.

306
00:37:03,326 --> 00:37:05,605
All we have to do is find out what it is

307
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:07,646
then we'll have leverage.

308
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:10,046
And then we can get the gold.

309
00:37:10,287 --> 00:37:12,326
What do you mean, we? It's my plan.

310
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:16,685
I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then I'm getting off this stinking planet.

311
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:18,087
Come on, sir.

312
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:20,326
You gotta let me in on it.

313
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:23,007
I barely make any lousy credits in this job.

314
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:26,287
And I've got five wives to support, sir.

315
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:31,808
I don't know if I want to partner up with an idiot.

316
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:34,847
How do I even know you understand the plan?

317
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:43,768
We train man-animals who don't need breath gas

318
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:46,047
to mine the gold for us.

319
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:49,489
But Home Planet owns this planet. The gold belongs to them.

320
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,048
That's the beauty of it.

321
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:53,448
Home Planet doesn't know the gold exists.

322
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:56,409
Those corporate crapheads won't know we stole it.

323
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,568
It's the perfect crime, sir.

324
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,769
Putting aside the serious violations of teaching mining to inferiors

325
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,729
and insulting corporate superiors, each one punishable by death.

326
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,770
So it is my duty to report you

327
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:12,651
though you'll be vaporized, and I'll have to train a new assistant.

328
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,770
But it's your stinking plan, sir.

329
00:38:15,968 --> 00:38:18,090
So I'm glad I have a recording of you

330
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:20,330
laying out the plan and my reprimanding you.

331
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,491
Think of it as part of your education.

332
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,328
Education, huh?

333
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:32,090
Never engage in a criminal activity unless you have a patsy to pin it on

334
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,290
in case you ever get found out.

335
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:37,090
Thank you. That's great.

336
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:39,210
But why do I have to be the patsy?

337
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:41,851
So you don't get any bright ideas to get rid of Terl

338
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:44,050
and keep the gold for yourself.

339
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,891
But I'd never double-cross you.

340
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:49,691
I've arranged that if any unfortunate accident were to befall me

341
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:53,092
this would go straight to the Home Office.

342
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:11,216
Double or nothing I can blow off one of its limbs.

343
00:40:17,855 --> 00:40:21,137
That one does seem to be unusually intelligent and resourceful.

344
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:23,495
But it's also defiant.

345
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:25,498
We'll need leverage over it.

346
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:27,815
Leverage? Over a man-animal?

347
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:29,897
Man is a primitive species

348
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:34,617
so we'll need something primitive for leverage. Like food.

349
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,657
What do you think a man-animal would like to eat?

350
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:39,736
What would he consider a treat?

351
00:40:39,976 --> 00:40:41,778
How the crap should I know?

352
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:44,057
There's no way of knowing that.

353
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,657
But before we educate it on the machine

354
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:51,058
we'll take it to the mountains with a couple of the others.

355
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:53,176
Let them think they've escaped

356
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:56,897
and then we'll sit back and watch it choose its favorite food.

357
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:58,858
Yes.

358
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:18,939
Look!

359
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:30,539
Three days, and they still haven't eaten anything yet.

360
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,179
Precisely. Now that the man-animals feel

361
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,420
that they have enough distance from us

362
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,620
soon they'll find their favorite food and celebrate.

363
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:51,621
What is it?

364
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:53,219
Food. Food!

365
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:03,580
No spark, no flints, nothing. You, Floyd?

366
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,100
Plenty to burn. Nothing to start a fire with.

367
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,982
-That's their favorite.
-Of course it is.

368
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:17,181
-They could've selected anything.
-It's not cooked.

369
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:22,181
If man-animal prefers rat uncooked, then our job is that much easier.

370
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:25,662
If they like their rat so much, how come those two aren't eating?

371
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:30,143
Don't you know anything? The leader of the pack always eats first. See?

372
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:39,744
We're really going to have leverage over them now.

373
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:55,104
What are you doing?

374
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:06,744
They know about the camera.

375
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:08,665
Don't be a knot-head. It's a man-animal.

376
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:11,064
It couldn't possibly know about it.

377
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:19,785
You sure called that one, sir.

378
00:43:19,984 --> 00:43:21,705
No way they know about the cameras.

379
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:24,545
Move your fat ass and let's go round them up!

380
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:26,866
Crap, lousy ceiling!

381
00:43:52,108 --> 00:43:54,106
Great. This is great.

382
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:05,667
What do we do now?

383
00:44:05,907 --> 00:44:08,707
What are you thinking, Jonnie? Don't even think about it.

384
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:12,468
You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie. You wouldn't live the jump!

385
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:15,068
You can surrender and rot in those cages.

386
00:44:15,307 --> 00:44:17,267
That's your choice. I'm not going back!

387
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:20,189
The monsters catch us, they'll take us to the mines.

388
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,709
Run!

389
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:06,671
How do we know what he wants?

390
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,951
They made me do this before. Follow me and you'll be fine.

391
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:22,151
Don't touch anything.

392
00:45:22,391 --> 00:45:24,631
Get them mad, think what they'll do to us.

393
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:53,832
Excuse me, but I am your instructor

394
00:45:54,074 --> 00:45:55,313
if you'll forgive such arrogance

395
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:58,754
for I do not have the honor to be a Psychlo.

396
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:00,353
I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.

397
00:46:02,992 --> 00:46:07,473
As you are listening to me, I most likely do not exist

398
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:11,594
as we may have been exterminated like many other races

399
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,633
by the gas drones of our conquerors.

400
00:46:14,956 --> 00:46:16,994
Please forgive my pretension

401
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:20,315
as I try to educate you in Psychlo

402
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:23,715
the noble language of our superiors.

403
00:47:03,957 --> 00:47:05,077
You understand?

404
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:08,878
You understand me?

405
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:12,916
Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?

406
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:18,758
Obviously, this is going to take a while.

407
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,918
Jonnie! Jonnie!

408
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,757
Carlo! Carlo!

409
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:49,720
I know who they are and where they're from. I can speak their language.

410
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:51,758
-Monsters?
-They're called Psychlos.

411
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,239
What did they do to him?

412
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:55,999
They made him look into a light, a god machine.

413
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:58,359
It teaches. It's a knowledge machine.

414
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,320
It sends pictures through your head so fast, it's spinning.

415
00:48:02,601 --> 00:48:04,201
Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.

416
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:08,600
No, I can't. I have to stay. I have to learn more about them.

417
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,440
This may be our only way out of here.

418
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,041
So this is the monster's language?

419
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,081
No, no. This is mathematics.

420
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,802
This is the unifying language of the entire universe.

421
00:48:43,362 --> 00:48:44,442
Look.

422
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:47,281
This symbol is called a triangle.

423
00:48:47,642 --> 00:48:50,041
If all these sides are equal

424
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:52,682
then these three angles must also be equal.

425
00:48:53,841 --> 00:48:54,843
Equal to what?

426
00:48:55,443 --> 00:48:56,563
To each other.

427
00:48:56,802 --> 00:48:59,803
It's the basic foundation of Euclidean geometry.

428
00:49:00,762 --> 00:49:02,524
Seems pretty hard to understand.

429
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:06,203
No, only at first. And then it becomes clear in your mind.

430
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,363
I learned molecular biology.

431
00:49:08,602 --> 00:49:12,643
This is the symbol for water and engineering.

432
00:49:13,202 --> 00:49:17,603
See, a wing, see? And line and form and artistic composition.

433
00:49:18,284 --> 00:49:20,524
You see, this is a square, like a cage.

434
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:24,884
I thought we were supposed to be working on stuff to help us escape.

435
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:28,445
This will.

436
00:49:29,284 --> 00:49:30,682
All this will.

437
00:49:45,164 --> 00:49:47,805
Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.

438
00:49:50,966 --> 00:49:54,165
"The security chief should secure the field vault

439
00:49:54,364 --> 00:49:57,285
with an eight-digit combination code

440
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:01,525
and do not use a personal or employee

441
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:03,046
identification number."

442
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:05,205
What's an identification number?

443
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:06,566
There.

444
00:50:06,766 --> 00:50:08,604
-How many numbers is that?
-Eight.

445
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:09,886
Eight?

446
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:11,887
Eight.

447
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,527
It's more clever than that.

448
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,327
The question is, how clever?

449
00:50:23,766 --> 00:50:25,567
Try the numbers backwards.

450
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:40,928
Look at this.

451
00:50:41,128 --> 00:50:42,848
It's a recording machine.

452
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:51,768
This is how he watches us.

453
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,688
Stop! Chrissy, stop!

454
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,609
What if he's not dead?

455
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,490
Hope is an admirable quality, but foolish isn't.

456
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,449
I can't give you permission to go and get killed.

457
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,289
I don't need your permission.

458
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:35,731
I'm no longer a child.

459
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,610
Do you want lunch?

460
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:04,612
It's obviously too much to ask a man-animal

461
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:07,052
to learn a language as sophisticated as Psychlo.

462
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:10,374
What if it can understand and it's pretending it can't?

463
00:52:10,571 --> 00:52:12,612
-What the hell for?
-I don't know.

464
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:16,172
Maybe it's secretly listening, trying to get leverage over on us.

465
00:52:16,652 --> 00:52:20,053
Man-animal getting leverage over a Psychlo. That'll be the day.

466
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:24,453
What if this one is particularly stupid?

467
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:26,332
Maybe we should train another one.

468
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:28,733
No time. When they detect the gold

469
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:31,373
the Planetship will know what we're doing.

470
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:37,854
We'll have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks.

471
00:52:47,975 --> 00:52:49,014
It speaks Psychlo.

472
00:52:49,215 --> 00:52:50,814
Go on, say something else.

473
00:52:51,174 --> 00:52:53,054
You'll stay here as my prisoner

474
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:55,935
while you, you go and get a transporter.

475
00:52:56,734 --> 00:52:59,454
Because you've learned Psychlo doesn't mean you are one.

476
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:01,734
Follow my orders or I'll have you killed.

477
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:06,895
How exactly do you plan to do that?

478
00:53:17,017 --> 00:53:18,976
-Mickey, no!
-Mickey, no!

479
00:53:20,216 --> 00:53:24,536
If any of you rat-brains knew anything about firearms

480
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:28,617
you would know that you never store loaded weapons.

481
00:53:28,817 --> 00:53:30,136
You drop him now!

482
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:32,897
Drop him or I won't mine an ounce of your gold.

483
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:37,017
I'll have you vaporized and find someone else to mine it.

484
00:53:37,218 --> 00:53:38,257
You don't have time.

485
00:53:38,657 --> 00:53:40,897
You can't hide this from Home Office forever.

486
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:46,658
A man getting leverage over a Psychlo. That'll be the day.

487
00:53:52,618 --> 00:53:57,137
I think it's time that we show our little friend a thing or two.

488
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,060
As long as you cling to the feeble hope

489
00:54:25,258 --> 00:54:27,100
that you'll ever get the better of me

490
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:30,099
you'll be distracted from more important things.

491
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:32,139
Which is exactly why

492
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,539
I share the following with you:

493
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,740
When we attacked your planet

494
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,380
all your soldiers and all their advanced technology

495
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,821
could only put up a nine-minute fight

496
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,941
before they were exterminated.

497
00:54:47,861 --> 00:54:51,461
Which is why man is an endangered species.

498
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:55,661
Everything you humans knew is here.

499
00:54:55,861 --> 00:54:57,861
You can look at anything you want

500
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,421
because there is nothing that will help you.

501
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:34,784
Satisfied?

502
00:55:35,302 --> 00:55:36,384
Yes.

503
00:55:37,142 --> 00:55:40,102
I have one more demonstration for you and your friends.

504
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:53,703
You will be relocated to a new mining site.

505
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:56,744
If any of you get any bright ideas about escaping

506
00:55:56,943 --> 00:56:00,983
keep in mind that although you know nothing about firearms, I do.

507
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:06,065
I graduated top marksman in my class. I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.

508
00:56:06,264 --> 00:56:07,664
Tell them what I said.

509
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,583
We try to run, he'll kill us.

510
00:56:10,065 --> 00:56:12,384
-That's it?
-Yes.

511
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:14,745
Allow me to demonstrate.

512
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:32,866
No! Wait!

513
00:56:49,426 --> 00:56:51,706
Let's give this demon what it deserves.

514
00:56:51,906 --> 00:56:54,107
Kill it, I say! Destroy it!

515
00:56:54,307 --> 00:56:56,267
Shoot! Shoot!

516
00:56:56,466 --> 00:56:57,466
Why wait? Kill it!

517
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:59,106
Kill it. Then we'll run.

518
00:56:59,307 --> 00:57:00,547
Then what?

519
00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:04,347
What kind of life is it to run? Living in fear of being hunted?

520
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,148
What about those we're leaving behind?

521
00:57:07,347 --> 00:57:09,067
There's nothing we can do.

522
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:10,787
Only the gods can free them.

523
00:57:10,988 --> 00:57:14,348
You think the lights in the sky are gods waiting to save us?

524
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:18,908
Do you? Those are planets, planets like this one.

525
00:57:19,108 --> 00:57:21,027
The great villages were built by us.

526
00:57:21,668 --> 00:57:23,589
By men and women just like us.

527
00:57:23,868 --> 00:57:26,429
Willing to fight to the death for one thing:

528
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,109
Their freedom!

529
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:30,708
Do you think no one has tried?

530
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,550
You can't defeat them.

531
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,710
That is our fate.

532
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,710
Yes, we can. Yes, we can!

533
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,749
But we have to go back.

534
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:49,150
We go back and learn about their weapons.

535
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:52,710
Our race is slowly dying and will be gone forever.

536
00:57:52,989 --> 00:57:56,550
Let it be said that we took this one chance and fought!

537
00:57:56,829 --> 00:57:59,271
Are you with me? Are you with me?!

538
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,390
We fight!

539
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:05,829
If you're fighting the beast, me and my men are with you.

540
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:08,951
Thank you. It's good to have friends out here.

541
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:11,030
May the gods be with you.

542
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:19,550
One as wise as you has ways to stop me from shooting.

543
00:58:19,911 --> 00:58:22,672
I know if I'd tried, you would've killed me first.

544
00:58:29,152 --> 00:58:33,031
Damn right, rat-brain! That's the first intelligent thing you've said.

545
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:36,233
Rest break is over.

546
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:40,313
There's something I need you to see so you're properly motivated.

547
00:59:00,393 --> 00:59:02,113
You don't know her?

548
00:59:03,594 --> 00:59:05,913
No, I don't know her.

549
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:09,913
She's one of the foulest looking females I've ever seen.

550
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:11,915
While I tend to agree

551
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,875
it's obvious that you show a lack of aptitude for strategic deception.

552
00:59:17,074 --> 00:59:21,433
On the other hand, what you show marginal proficiency at is

553
00:59:22,554 --> 00:59:23,674
drawing.

554
00:59:25,755 --> 00:59:27,795
This was found when she was collected.

555
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,916
The collar has enough explosives to remove her head from her body.

556
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:34,755
And this remote

557
00:59:35,195 --> 00:59:37,795
will activate it from anywhere on the planet.

558
00:59:37,996 --> 00:59:41,076
So if you disobey me, let me show you what will happen.

559
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:42,876
Please don't harm her.

560
00:59:43,835 --> 00:59:44,995
I believe you.

561
00:59:45,196 --> 00:59:47,477
Don't worry, rat-brain.

562
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:50,397
Every collar has its own frequency.

563
00:59:50,676 --> 00:59:53,315
I'm not going to blow up your little female friend.

564
00:59:55,395 --> 00:59:56,677
Just

565
00:59:58,676 --> 00:59:59,756
this one.

566
01:00:01,437 --> 01:00:02,756
You made your point.

567
01:00:02,956 --> 01:00:04,916
I said I would mine your gold.

568
01:00:05,557 --> 01:00:07,278
Please don't kill him. Please.

569
01:00:11,197 --> 01:00:12,318
Fine.

570
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:17,117
Due to our new working relationship, I will grant you this one request.

571
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:20,038
I won't kill him.

572
01:00:20,676 --> 01:00:23,197
But you may never ask of me anything again.

573
01:00:23,718 --> 01:00:24,837
I promise.

574
01:00:28,477 --> 01:00:31,278
As I've said, I won't kill him.

575
01:00:31,479 --> 01:00:32,478
Yes, sir.

576
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,320
Stupid humans.

577
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,560
No, no, no.

578
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:21,601
What you did was right.

579
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:23,600
It was right for all of us.

580
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:26,480
Greener, you're a thinker

581
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:28,880
and the gods respect thinkers.

582
01:01:29,401 --> 01:01:31,161
You didn't kill Sammy.

583
01:01:32,003 --> 01:01:34,601
Jonnie, this is not living.

584
01:01:35,322 --> 01:01:37,401
This is

585
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:38,961
cages!

586
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,282
Cages!

587
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:43,842
Even if we escaped and went back to where we all came from

588
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:45,243
it'd be like you said.

589
01:01:45,443 --> 01:01:48,081
We'd be waiting for the Psychlos to hunt us down.

590
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:51,562
I think that is not living either.

591
01:01:55,881 --> 01:01:57,722
We all chose to fight.

592
01:02:22,483 --> 01:02:25,044
-Count us in too!
-What's going on?

593
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:28,244
Someone knows how to speak the Psychlo's language.

594
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,005
He's gonna help us fight.

595
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:25,326
Yes.

596
01:03:26,328 --> 01:03:29,088
Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.

597
01:03:30,048 --> 01:03:32,287
She's...

598
01:03:32,487 --> 01:03:34,568
His soon-to-be newly acquired secretary.

599
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:36,967
-Yes.
-Really?

600
01:03:37,328 --> 01:03:41,007
She's stupid enough not to be a menace, pretty enough to be decorative.

601
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:45,288
She gets drunk with economical speed and has other advantages.

602
01:03:48,169 --> 01:03:49,607
I can see that.

603
01:03:49,848 --> 01:03:52,368
-Don't you have some work to do?
-No.

604
01:03:52,569 --> 01:03:53,368
Ker?

605
01:03:53,608 --> 01:03:54,928
All right, sir.

606
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,009
Now, listen, missy

607
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:02,208
I'm still waiting for the Planetship's accounts.

608
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:08,089
I had to go way beyond the call of duty to get these.

609
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:11,330
I see. Well, that's why I especially chose you.

610
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:13,969
So you'll keep your side of the bargain?

611
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:16,490
Which was?

612
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:20,369
You said we'd have a huge house when we go back to Psychlo next year.

613
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,891
-We're going to be rich, right?
-Right.

614
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,811
I am going to make you as happy as a baby Psychlo

615
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,691
on a straight diet of Kerbango.

616
01:04:42,652 --> 01:04:44,452
Well, isn't it interesting

617
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:47,252
that you have been keeping two sets of books

618
01:04:47,452 --> 01:04:49,451
and telling all the workers

619
01:04:49,691 --> 01:04:52,012
that the planet has been operating at a loss?

620
01:04:53,651 --> 01:04:57,333
I only claimed that it was running at a loss

621
01:04:57,572 --> 01:05:01,653
to try and motivate them all to work harder.

622
01:05:01,852 --> 01:05:03,373
Oh, yes, of course.

623
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:05,892
And it had nothing to do with the fact

624
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:08,412
that it allowed you to cut the workers' pay

625
01:05:08,652 --> 01:05:11,654
and keep all the extra credit for yourself. Did it?

626
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:15,613
That. Well, I can explain that.

627
01:05:15,814 --> 01:05:20,012
Well, unfortunately, the company requires me to vaporize you.

628
01:05:21,653 --> 01:05:22,652
On the other hand

629
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:26,214
I could understand someone in your situation

630
01:05:26,414 --> 01:05:28,493
being old and having no future

631
01:05:28,734 --> 01:05:31,575
coming up with ways to solve your financial problems.

632
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:35,254
-You can?
-Oh, yes.

633
01:05:35,574 --> 01:05:37,974
It's really of no interest to anybody

634
01:05:38,174 --> 01:05:40,454
to have you not be Planetship.

635
01:05:40,694 --> 01:05:44,573
But it would be prudent of you to start to share your authority.

636
01:05:54,415 --> 01:05:58,335
But these forms are all blank, undated.

637
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:01,335
You could put anything you wanted on them.

638
01:06:01,576 --> 01:06:05,015
You would run the entire planet!

639
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:10,935
I would be nothing but a puppet.

640
01:06:11,576 --> 01:06:14,095
Well, if you don't want to do it that way

641
01:06:14,296 --> 01:06:16,337
we could always do it by

642
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:18,896
the book.

643
01:06:25,016 --> 01:06:28,976
What the hell does the Planetship need with all this mining equipment?

644
01:06:29,178 --> 01:06:30,897
That's not even the crazy part.

645
01:06:31,096 --> 01:06:34,497
He's ordered me to take a group of man-animals to a remote area

646
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:37,856
with the equipment to see if they can be trained to mine.

647
01:06:38,057 --> 01:06:41,137
Man-animals being able to mine?

648
01:06:41,337 --> 01:06:42,496
Yes.

649
01:06:49,378 --> 01:06:51,417
Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.

650
01:06:51,976 --> 01:06:53,138
Indeed.

651
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:54,938
But what can I do?

652
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:56,978
An order is an order.

653
01:07:01,698 --> 01:07:03,698
You have a busy day, rat-brain.

654
01:07:03,899 --> 01:07:05,418
First, learning how to fly

655
01:07:05,658 --> 01:07:08,578
then on to the learning machine for mining techniques.

656
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,220
Crash one more time

657
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:41,581
and your little friend will no longer be among the living.

658
01:07:41,981 --> 01:07:42,861
Again.

659
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,501
Again!

660
01:08:24,622 --> 01:08:27,944
Never underestimate what a little leverage can do, rat-brain.

661
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:55,144
That's good, man-animal.

662
01:08:55,744 --> 01:08:58,823
This is the lever where we mine the gold!

663
01:08:59,023 --> 01:09:01,063
Lever! Up, down!

664
01:09:02,345 --> 01:09:05,704
Warning: External sensors indicate dangerous radiation levels ahead.

665
01:09:05,903 --> 01:09:07,624
This is as far as I can go!

666
01:09:07,825 --> 01:09:09,185
Land it!

667
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:24,825
Meet me back here in 14 days.

668
01:09:25,026 --> 01:09:27,106
I want the ship's cage half-filled with gold.

669
01:09:31,986 --> 01:09:34,625
And even though I won't be at the mining site

670
01:09:36,826 --> 01:09:38,027
I'll be watching you.

671
01:09:48,066 --> 01:09:50,947
-How's your side?
-It's good. Good.

672
01:10:03,067 --> 01:10:04,746
Next time, you fly.

673
01:10:15,828 --> 01:10:18,628
No, no, no. Even if we do mine enough gold

674
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:21,710
we'll be lucky to fill half of that cage in time.

675
01:10:21,909 --> 01:10:23,108
That's why we're not mining.

676
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:26,708
What about the big uglies watching us with that eye in the sky?

677
01:10:26,909 --> 01:10:29,108
Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?

678
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,669
We split them in half. One group goes

679
01:10:31,869 --> 01:10:33,148
and one group stays

680
01:10:33,348 --> 01:10:35,750
and it looks as if we're still working.

681
01:10:37,589 --> 01:10:41,390
But if we don't deliver it in 14 days to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.

682
01:10:41,629 --> 01:10:43,748
There's a place called Fort Knox where the gold's already been mined.

683
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,871
Listen, there will be no mining, but we'll deliver it.

684
01:10:47,069 --> 01:10:50,670
Okay, so we have to pretend that we're mining the gold.

685
01:10:52,109 --> 01:10:55,190
We have to figure out where we're gonna get the gold

686
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,830
then we have to get the supplies to help our revolt.

687
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,429
Yeah.

688
01:10:59,629 --> 01:11:02,031
We barely have men to do one of those things

689
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:04,070
let alone all three.

690
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,751
It's good to have friends on the outside!

691
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:26,912
Come on!

692
01:11:27,112 --> 01:11:29,833
If you two kept your eyes open, that'd be a great help.

693
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:32,952
Look for an ocean. If you see any, we've gone too far.

694
01:11:35,153 --> 01:11:36,751
I think this is it.

695
01:11:36,952 --> 01:11:38,672
I think we're in Washington.

696
01:11:38,873 --> 01:11:41,431
-We're still in Colorado.
-That's impossible.

697
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,273
I've been watching, we haven't crossed this line.

698
01:11:43,474 --> 01:11:45,313
You're not paying attention.

699
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:49,113
Let him navigate and watch me. You're gonna fly on the way back.

700
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:52,273
We couldn't have crossed all these lines.

701
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,913
Well, we did. The lines must have faded over time.

702
01:12:10,555 --> 01:12:13,634
This great village was the capital for all our tribes.

703
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:16,234
This is where our people's history was buried.

704
01:12:26,235 --> 01:12:29,076
Here. When the Psychlos attacked Earth

705
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:31,315
they sent out flying gas drones.

706
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:35,036
Our ancestors must've made it out into these remote radiated areas

707
01:12:35,234 --> 01:12:38,835
and the only reason they survived was because radiation is

708
01:12:39,036 --> 01:12:40,595
lethal to the Psychlos.

709
01:12:40,795 --> 01:12:43,637
-And that was not good for them.
-That's good for us.

710
01:12:43,836 --> 01:12:46,636
Even if we fail, the people will be safe if they stay--

711
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:48,555
Safe from being hunted

712
01:12:48,836 --> 01:12:51,435
but radiation is also poisonous for humans.

713
01:12:52,355 --> 01:12:54,037
So, you see, either way

714
01:12:55,036 --> 01:12:57,118
if we don't take back our planet

715
01:12:58,757 --> 01:13:00,997
the last of humanity becomes extinct.

716
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:30,557
Based on what I've read about Psychlo security

717
01:13:30,757 --> 01:13:31,918
if we revolted

718
01:13:32,118 --> 01:13:35,278
only using weapons they don't perceive as any real threat

719
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:37,878
if we just use rocks and sticks

720
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:41,079
they'll just throw us back in the cages.

721
01:13:41,277 --> 01:13:42,438
But

722
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:46,478
we're gonna stage this revolt inside the dome.

723
01:13:46,678 --> 01:13:51,199
So the Psychlos are gonna have to come inside the city to round us up.

724
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:54,719
And that is when we blow the dome.

725
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,440
Carlo's gonna blow the dome.

726
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,719
-They won't have masks.
-They can't breathe.

727
01:13:59,918 --> 01:14:01,040
-They die.
-Carlo?

728
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:04,080
-I'm gonna blow the dome?
-You're gonna blow the dome.

729
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,601
Piece of cake. Piece of cake, piece of cake.

730
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,679
But remember, as soon as we blow the dome

731
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:16,760
boom, stage 2 alarm.

732
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,761
What is that?

733
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:21,041
Thousands of gas drones and troops will be teleported here.

734
01:14:21,242 --> 01:14:24,600
-We can't fight against that.
-Then what's the point?

735
01:14:24,801 --> 01:14:28,000
If they send more monsters to Earth, we get wiped out.

736
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,241
Well, the point is, we don't let it get to stage 2.

737
01:14:31,441 --> 01:14:33,921
We'll destroy their Home Planet before it happens.

738
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:36,801
-Their Home Planet?
-Their Home Planet.

739
01:14:38,401 --> 01:14:41,121
We need some extra supplies before we can do that.

740
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:43,641
Our first stop is a radiation bomb storage bunker.

741
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,122
Is everyone clear?

742
01:14:48,042 --> 01:14:49,042
Count us in.

743
01:15:19,122 --> 01:15:20,884
-Look.
-Flying machines.

744
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:24,203
These are flying machines. They're weapons of some kind.

745
01:15:26,764 --> 01:15:28,124
Flying spears.

746
01:15:28,444 --> 01:15:30,605
I think there's a little more to it than that.

747
01:15:47,445 --> 01:15:49,125
It's a learning machine.

748
01:15:49,765 --> 01:15:51,165
Teach us to fly.

749
01:16:09,286 --> 01:16:10,326
You're right.

750
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:11,926
It's like breaking a horse.

751
01:16:12,646 --> 01:16:14,726
Can you teach your men to fly this?

752
01:16:14,926 --> 01:16:17,727
-Piece of cake, piece of cake.
-Piece of cake.

753
01:16:17,927 --> 01:16:19,607
-Try and keep it level.
-Jonnie!

754
01:16:19,807 --> 01:16:21,008
-What is it?
-I think I found one.

755
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:24,006
Come on! Nuclear firebomb!

756
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:25,487
Piece of cake.

757
01:16:26,488 --> 01:16:28,967
According to the book, there's a firing mechanism

758
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:32,488
that has to be in place before it's operational.

759
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,928
Don't touch the auto-sensor.

760
01:16:54,128 --> 01:16:55,608
What happens if we do?

761
01:16:55,809 --> 01:16:58,449
The bomb will explode. Big fire.

762
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:01,889
Look. Greeners from this cave.

763
01:17:02,089 --> 01:17:03,690
Off. Off.

764
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:19,771
War--

765
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:20,849
--ning.

766
01:17:21,049 --> 01:17:22,730
Warning. Warning.

767
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:24,090
Warning.

768
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:26,810
Warning.

769
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,090
Get it?

770
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,651
What does the auto-sensor look like?

771
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,051
There's an illustration in Appendix A.

772
01:17:43,452 --> 01:17:44,890
What? What?

773
01:17:48,451 --> 01:17:49,852
We don't have Appendix A.

774
01:17:58,092 --> 01:17:59,132
More books, Jonnie.

775
01:18:07,493 --> 01:18:08,814
It's okay.

776
01:18:09,493 --> 01:18:12,092
I thought you said nuclear fires were powerful?

777
01:18:12,292 --> 01:18:13,772
It's not nuclear. Mickey!

778
01:18:13,973 --> 01:18:15,173
Sorry.

779
01:18:15,373 --> 01:18:16,853
You're sorry. Mickey!

780
01:18:17,053 --> 01:18:20,013
Stop touching things and turn off the damn light.

781
01:18:20,214 --> 01:18:21,173
Leave it on.

782
01:18:22,934 --> 01:18:24,133
Look.

783
01:18:30,053 --> 01:18:31,493
Good work, Mickey.

784
01:18:31,735 --> 01:18:33,614
You just found Appendix A.

785
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,214
Will this be enough to blow up their whole planet?

786
01:18:51,414 --> 01:18:53,696
Radiation reacts with their planet's atmosphere.

787
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,775
-There's enough to destroy it forever.
-Let me do it.

788
01:18:58,894 --> 01:19:01,094
Let me go there and detonate the weapon.

789
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:04,535
It's brave of you, Mickey, but it's my plan, so I go.

790
01:19:04,735 --> 01:19:07,696
You're the only one who speaks the monsters' language.

791
01:19:07,895 --> 01:19:09,815
You know things about them!

792
01:19:10,576 --> 01:19:12,136
Listen

793
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:14,936
without you leading this revolt

794
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:17,696
we might not succeed.

795
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,818
I hope their eye in the sky didn't see the gold through the lead walls.

796
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:31,021
Start filling the cage.

797
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:34,900
We'll hide half and deliver the other half to Terl tonight.

798
01:20:53,981 --> 01:20:55,460
Why is it in bars?

799
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,861
I assumed, sir

800
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:02,901
that a Psychlo of your refinement wouldn't want raw ore.

801
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,100
Really?

802
01:21:19,182 --> 01:21:21,222
Since you have had extra time

803
01:21:21,422 --> 01:21:23,422
to smelt it into bricks

804
01:21:23,623 --> 01:21:26,183
I'll expect the rest of the gold in seven days.

805
01:21:54,663 --> 01:21:57,065
He has no intention of sharing that gold with you.

806
01:21:59,143 --> 01:22:01,665
What the hell are you talking about?

807
01:22:02,863 --> 01:22:05,585
Why are you here? You should be mining the gold!

808
01:22:05,784 --> 01:22:08,624
You really think the only reason he made that recording

809
01:22:08,825 --> 01:22:11,784
was to have you as his patsy? Do you, Ker?

810
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:15,305
No. He has leverage over you

811
01:22:15,504 --> 01:22:18,025
and it'll guarantee you never see an ounce.

812
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:21,664
How do you know about those recordings?

813
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:23,667
It really is amazing

814
01:22:23,866 --> 01:22:26,625
the collection of discs you find in Terl's personal vault.

815
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:42,586
First, we trade.

816
01:22:42,787 --> 01:22:44,347
-The disc--
-I don't think so!

817
01:22:44,586 --> 01:22:46,866
Because if you don't give me the disc now

818
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:48,707
I will blow your head off.

819
01:23:08,589 --> 01:23:10,107
You want to trade?

820
01:23:11,388 --> 01:23:12,508
Let's trade.

821
01:23:13,748 --> 01:23:14,947
Hooray!

822
01:23:17,148 --> 01:23:19,429
Won't the Psychlo see I'm not wearing the collar?

823
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:22,629
After tonight, won't matter much either way.

824
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:26,508
Jonnie, I know you don't believe in fate

825
01:23:26,789 --> 01:23:28,951
but I've always known this was your destiny.

826
01:23:29,309 --> 01:23:32,190
This is our destiny. It's freedom for all of us.

827
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:34,149
For our children.

828
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,749
Children?

829
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:01,151
Beautiful.

830
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:14,791
Quickly!

831
01:24:31,472 --> 01:24:34,072
What if this one is particularly stupid?

832
01:24:34,272 --> 01:24:36,672
There's no time. When they detect the gold...

833
01:24:36,873 --> 01:24:39,352
the Planetship will know what we're doing.

834
01:24:43,713 --> 01:24:46,873
We'll have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks.

835
01:24:48,632 --> 01:24:52,433
When they detect the gold, the Planetship will know what we're doing.

836
01:24:54,832 --> 01:24:57,113
We'll have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks.

837
01:24:57,314 --> 01:24:58,152
I've been thinking.

838
01:24:58,672 --> 01:25:02,355
80/20 is a pretty fair distribution of the gold.

839
01:25:03,033 --> 01:25:04,712
But I should get the 80%.

840
01:25:05,473 --> 01:25:08,754
And with my share, I'm gonna fire all my wives

841
01:25:08,994 --> 01:25:10,394
and buy new ones.

842
01:25:11,394 --> 01:25:13,513
Maybe pretty ones this time.

843
01:25:14,674 --> 01:25:15,755
Ker-bango!

844
01:25:17,953 --> 01:25:19,074
Congratulations.

845
01:25:19,355 --> 01:25:22,314
You've learned how to get leverage over someone, haven't you?

846
01:25:23,075 --> 01:25:25,995
Which means I haven't wasted my time training you, have I?

847
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,595
-You're not upset?
-Don't be crazy.

848
01:25:28,955 --> 01:25:30,876
You know how long I've waited for this day?

849
01:25:31,115 --> 01:25:33,155
I know the perfect way to celebrate.

850
01:25:35,115 --> 01:25:37,315
What are you doing?

851
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:39,757
You can't shoot me.

852
01:25:39,956 --> 01:25:42,916
I made a copy and gave it to someone for safekeeping.

853
01:25:43,115 --> 01:25:46,115
You are just too good of a teacher.

854
01:25:46,876 --> 01:25:50,916
How about giving your old teacher a clue as to who this might be?

855
01:25:51,116 --> 01:25:53,115
You insult yourself, sir.

856
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:54,636
You taught me better.

857
01:25:54,836 --> 01:25:56,956
How am I supposed to know who it is?

858
01:25:57,156 --> 01:25:58,636
I don't know.

859
01:25:58,837 --> 01:26:01,357
It could be anybody on this damn planet.

860
01:26:01,598 --> 01:26:03,517
-It could be a mechanic.
-No.

861
01:26:03,756 --> 01:26:05,797
-It could be a concubine.
-No, no.

862
01:26:05,997 --> 01:26:08,317
It could be anybody in communications.

863
01:26:08,517 --> 01:26:09,357
Wrong!

864
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:13,318
I hate these things. It's like it's a test I'm not prepared for.

865
01:26:14,718 --> 01:26:19,237
Well, hell, it could even be our friendly bartender!

866
01:26:24,677 --> 01:26:26,797
Please. I made a mistake.

867
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:33,677
Now, give me the original disc

868
01:26:33,878 --> 01:26:37,117
then meet me at the teleportation platform in two hours.

869
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:39,638
Sir.

870
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,199
The control bunker's to the right.

871
01:26:51,599 --> 01:26:52,519
Three guards left.

872
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:55,600
Two from the guardhouse, one coming from the north.

873
01:26:56,359 --> 01:26:57,879
I'll take the guardhouse.

874
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:02,122
Jonnie, the shooting's triggered the alarm.

875
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:06,162
Five guards from the south, heavily armed and moving fast.

876
01:28:06,443 --> 01:28:07,804
Between you and the bunker.

877
01:28:08,282 --> 01:28:09,444
Jonnie!

878
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:15,926
The man-animals have escaped. They're running into the city.

879
01:29:16,207 --> 01:29:19,126
Send some guards out and round them up. I'm busy.

880
01:29:19,327 --> 01:29:21,648
Don't bother me with every little detail.

881
01:29:21,847 --> 01:29:23,248
Gotta round them up.

882
01:29:34,408 --> 01:29:35,448
Psychlos!

883
01:29:36,808 --> 01:29:38,048
Psychlos!

884
01:29:39,889 --> 01:29:41,769
7-7-3.

885
01:29:43,368 --> 01:29:46,689
Greener? Carlo. Explosives are set. Can I blow the dome?

886
01:29:48,688 --> 01:29:49,689
Greener?

887
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:52,128
What's going on? Talk to me!

888
01:29:52,328 --> 01:29:54,809
It's Carlo. What's going on? Talk to me.

889
01:29:55,009 --> 01:29:56,209
Hold on!

890
01:29:57,489 --> 01:29:59,768
If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo, they'll send drones.

891
01:29:59,969 --> 01:30:03,169
Well, hurry up. Just hurry up, because I've got company.

892
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:43,257
Here they are.

893
01:33:10,537 --> 01:33:12,540
Panther!

894
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:35,699
Hang on. I'm right on his tail.

895
01:34:24,142 --> 01:34:25,863
You know what you gotta do.

896
01:34:53,103 --> 01:34:54,263
Greener, come on.

897
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,984
I've gotta blow this dome now!

898
01:34:56,185 --> 01:34:58,424
I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb. Hang on.

899
01:34:58,703 --> 01:34:59,945
I'm seconds away.

900
01:35:12,425 --> 01:35:13,426
Jonnie, come on.

901
01:35:13,665 --> 01:35:15,386
They're destroying the bombs.

902
01:35:15,664 --> 01:35:17,067
-It's now or never.
-Now!

903
01:35:17,267 --> 01:35:19,824
Now, go ahead! Blow the dome! Go! Go! Go!

904
01:35:26,225 --> 01:35:28,905
Teleportation sequence terminated.

905
01:35:29,985 --> 01:35:31,426
Interrupting something?

906
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:33,385
Jonnie? Jonnie?

907
01:36:05,187 --> 01:36:07,307
Why isn't it coming down?

908
01:36:08,468 --> 01:36:10,509
The dome is holding!

909
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:13,787
-It's not working.
-It's only cracked!

910
01:36:18,428 --> 01:36:21,108
The dome isn't broken. We can't hold out long.

911
01:36:23,948 --> 01:36:27,068
Attention! This is Terl, your chief of security.

912
01:36:27,789 --> 01:36:30,870
Exterminate all man-animals at will.

913
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:32,509
And happy hunting!

914
01:36:45,910 --> 01:36:47,790
Run! Run!

915
01:37:16,071 --> 01:37:17,311
What's with the dome?

916
01:37:18,471 --> 01:37:20,871
Hold on, I'm taking it out now.

917
01:38:00,953 --> 01:38:02,314
Help us!

918
01:38:02,673 --> 01:38:03,754
They're killing us!

919
01:38:11,395 --> 01:38:14,636
We're not gonna make it! I think we should pull out!

920
01:38:34,316 --> 01:38:37,875
I'm blowing the dome. In five.

921
01:38:38,476 --> 01:38:39,554
Four.

922
01:38:45,716 --> 01:38:46,836
Three.

923
01:38:47,677 --> 01:38:48,717
Two.

924
01:38:49,275 --> 01:38:50,115
One.

925
01:38:52,196 --> 01:38:53,677
Piece of cake.

926
01:39:21,037 --> 01:39:23,238
Everyone on the ground now! Go!

927
01:40:45,082 --> 01:40:47,641
Teleportation sequence activated.

928
01:40:49,522 --> 01:40:52,163
Teleportation sequence activated.

929
01:40:52,763 --> 01:40:55,562
Psychlo War Center, this is a stage 3 alert!

930
01:40:55,803 --> 01:40:57,802
I repeat, a stage 3 alert.

931
01:40:58,003 --> 01:41:00,803
Initiate the gas drone extermination sequence.

932
01:41:14,805 --> 01:41:17,125
You have been quite a challenge, rat-brain.

933
01:41:17,323 --> 01:41:19,443
You'll make a hell of a conversation piece

934
01:41:19,684 --> 01:41:22,804
when you're stuffed and hanging on the academy wall.

935
01:42:08,326 --> 01:42:09,967
Where's the rest of my gold?

936
01:42:10,367 --> 01:42:12,567
I'll exchange it for my woman's life.

937
01:42:13,207 --> 01:42:16,326
My life is over, but hers is of no consequence to you.

938
01:42:17,367 --> 01:42:20,567
Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain. Now, where is it?

939
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:22,966
Trust me, you don't want to do that.

940
01:42:23,206 --> 01:42:25,486
Trust me, there's nothing I want more.

941
01:44:03,293 --> 01:44:05,013
Carlo came through.

942
01:45:02,575 --> 01:45:05,056
Why don't you vaporize me?

943
01:45:12,657 --> 01:45:13,575
Leverage.

944
01:45:17,336 --> 01:45:20,017
If there are other Psychlo colonies out there

945
01:45:20,216 --> 01:45:22,976
they'll send out gas drones and exterminate us.

946
01:45:23,696 --> 01:45:26,578
But if they learn that it was your greed

947
01:45:27,337 --> 01:45:29,375
that destroyed their Home Planet

948
01:45:31,696 --> 01:45:34,057
then all the credits in the universe

949
01:45:34,779 --> 01:45:37,177
won't equal the bounty on your head.

950
01:45:49,897 --> 01:45:53,577
But there is one thing you rat-brains weren't smart enough to realize.

951
01:45:53,898 --> 01:45:55,177
Kill them.

952
01:46:08,659 --> 01:46:10,539
I fixed the problem with it.

953
01:46:11,778 --> 01:46:13,338
-It works now.
-You imbecile!

954
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:15,740
What kind of game are you playing?

955
01:46:16,179 --> 01:46:20,500
Since I'm teaching them our technology, they made me the head Psychlo.

956
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,460
Look at the bright side.

957
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:31,780
You may not be wallowing in luxury on Psychlo

958
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:36,499
but at least you finally got your gold.
