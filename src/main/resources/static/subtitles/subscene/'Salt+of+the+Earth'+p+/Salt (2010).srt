1
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,136
Please let me go home. Please.

2
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,884
Please I'm not who you think I am.

3
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,099
I'm really not who you think I am.
I am...

4
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,060
Please. Please. I'm not a spy.

5
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,770
You are a spy.
I'm not a spy.

6
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,276
Please let me go home.

7
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,178
Try again.

8
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,942
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

9
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,570
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

10
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,656
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

11
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,710
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

12
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,497
I am not a spy! I am not a spy!

13
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,745
Try again.

14
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:44,217
I am not a spy.

15
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,689
You are a spy.
I am not a spy.

16
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,191
Don't lie to me!

17
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,327
I am not a spy.

18
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,042
<i>It is through the grace and munificence
of our glorious Dear Leader</i>

19
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,837
<i>that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea</i>

20
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,591
<i>has pardoned the American imperialist</i>

21
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,845
<i>for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.</i>

22
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,257
Keep your head down.
Don't say anything till we make the swap.

23
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,353
In case Kim Jong here changes his mind.

24
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,227
Exchange.

25
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,579
Right face!

26
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,918
Right face!

27
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,646
I don't understand.

28
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,765
You don't understand what?

29
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,636
All the rules say to leave me, that one life,

30
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,456
is not worth blowing operational cover.

31
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,932
You got that right.

32
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,803
If we have to lose someone for
the greater good, we will.

33
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,712
So why did you do it?

34
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,816
Well, I didn't do it.

35
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,769
He did.

36
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,282
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

37
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,036
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

38
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,248
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something

39
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,160
or he's gonna invade this goddamn
rice-paddy republic himself.

40
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,220
You okay?

41
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,107
Yeah.

42
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,703
Hey.

43
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,865
Good morning.
Happy anniversary.

44
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,078
You want me to make you breakfast?

45
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,664
How about pancakes?

46
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,791
Your cooking?

47
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,960
You're joking. You like my cooking.

48
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,928
Germans don't joke.

49
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,257
Burt likes my cooking.

50
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,349
Get your bugs off the table.

51
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,201
They're spiders.
They're bugs.

52
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,446
They're spiders.
They're bugs.

53
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,813
<i>Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.</i>

54
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,367
<i>Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back,</i>

55
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,370
<i>and over one another
about a third of the way.</i>

56
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,676
<i>Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.</i>

57
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,170
Are you doing this on company time?

58
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:40,007
It's my anniversary.

59
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,510
And I want it to be perfect.

60
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,889
But that is not sexy.

61
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,766
No, but it is utilitarian.

62
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,102
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

63
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,856
I ran the trace.
First name Usam, last name Utsaev.

64
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,524
Any verifiable hits?
One.

65
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,628
Hey, Francis, do me a favor and stick
that in the safe till tomorrow.

66
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,280
Mata Hari here's got a big night tonight.

67
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,157
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

68
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,785
Sir? Do I look like a sir to you?

69
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,195
From head to toe.

70
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,290
I'm surprised he didn't call you Your Majesty.

71
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,783
I like the ring of that.

72
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:17,141
I think I'd prefer Your Majesty.

73
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,506
Was I ever that young?

74
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,967
Younger.

75
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,270
Walk me out.

76
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,473
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

77
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,475
Oh, you know.
The usual.

78
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:35,283
President wants to know what's happening
in Russia the day before it happens.

79
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:38,203
How about you?
I heard that interview went well.

80
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,767
Fingers crossed.

81
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,286
You sure about this?

82
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,614
You know, once you start pushing
paper, there's no turning back.

83
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,759
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

84
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,787
I was homesick.
Homesick?

85
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,689
Sir! Sir!
Can't you take something for that?

86
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,580
We got a walk-in.

87
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,795
A defector, 10 minutes ago.
Here?

88
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:01,660
I guess he's not buying our cover.

89
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,715
Did you get his bona fides?
He's Russian.

90
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,109
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

91
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,387
He's a strange guy.
How's his English?

92
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,681
Passable. Not great.

93
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,425
But if it got down to the subtleties
of English nuance...

94
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,321
Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

95
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,730
Come on, Salt.

96
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,967
No one can sort out a nutjob
from the real thing faster than you.

97
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,879
I got 25 minutes.
I got 26. Let's go.

98
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,988
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

99
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,707
Who called Counter intelligence?
Not me.

100
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,101
Hey, Ted.
We're crashing the party.

101
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,405
Peabody.
Salt.

102
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,970
Please remove the hood.

103
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,182
Microphones are on.

104
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,909
Checking levels.

105
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,020
Baseline recorded.

106
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,935
Neural scan is up.
Ready to go.

107
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,675
Ev.

108
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,825
Commencing audio and visual recording.

109
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,460
<i>Testing earpiece.</i>

110
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,908
Interview has commenced at 1442.

111
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,011
You're married.

112
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,857
A husband must be a distraction

113
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,353
for a female intelligence officer.

114
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,788
Well, we're here to talk about you.

115
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,423
So, what is your name?

116
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,768
My name is.

117
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,414
Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

118
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,637
I have cancer.

119
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,447
I'm moved.

120
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,341
A defector with cancer.

121
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,554
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

122
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,392
If I have gained anything by damning myself,

123
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,648
it is that I no longer have anything to fear.

124
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,277
Russia is also dying.

125
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,864
But unlike me, she's not dead.
Oleg Vassily Orlov,

126
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,742
shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

127
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,203
He was on Victor Barisovsky's staff there.

128
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,663
<i>He checks out as FSB, Ev.</i>

129
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,708
Scan says he's truthful on the cancer.

130
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,293
Prior to '93?

131
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,587
<i>Russia was once strong, powerful...</i>

132
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,256
Nothing.
He doesn't exist.

133
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,177
<i>And she will be again
when things have been set back</i>

134
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,145
on the correct path.

135
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,307
I have somewhere I need to be,
Mr. Orlov,

136
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,059
so if you wouldn't mind getting to the point.

137
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,441
I came here to tell you a story.

138
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,152
I don't like stories.

139
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,113
But I'll listen anyway.

140
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,199
In English, please.

141
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,159
Others are listening.

142
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,779
1975.

143
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,490
The Cold war.

144
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,377
In a gymnasium in Grozny,

145
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,796
a Soviet Olympic wrestler

146
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,509
named Sasha Fyorodovich Chenkov

147
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,594
meets for the first time

148
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:40,398
the only female chess grand master
of her era;

149
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,478
Anka Nurekyova.

150
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,357
Within a month, they were married.

151
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:51,985
And within a year, a child.

152
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,571
One month more,

153
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,784
the child was back in the same hospital,

154
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,327
sick with fever.

155
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,249
And within days after that,

156
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,602
the child suddenly was dead.

157
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,050
Yes, a child was dead.

158
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,229
And, yes, a child was buried.

159
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:30,090
But the Chenkov baby was alive

160
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,436
and became the property of another man.

161
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,283
A master spy who had
devised the greatest plan

162
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,687
a Russian patriot could ever invent.

163
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:48,292
A plan to destroy America.

164
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,919
It had all started

165
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:55,048
with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

166
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,344
In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.

167
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,431
Three years later, he returned home.

168
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,392
But the man who came back to America

169
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:11,023
was in fact a Russian spy named Alek.

170
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,943
On November 22nd, 1963,

171
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,656
Alek became the first success
of the new program

172
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,127
and a hero of the Soviet Union.

173
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,622
The spymaster was now
given the go-ahead

174
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,625
to create many more like Alek.

175
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,253
Scores of agents, males and females,

176
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,048
to be substituted for Americans.

177
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,179
At an abandoned monastery,

178
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,141
Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English

179
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,852
long before they learned Russian.

180
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,146
Drilled in idiom,

181
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,524
idiosyncrasy and...

182
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,859
ideology.

183
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:02,241
And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming,

184
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,494
the spymaster made warriors of iron.

185
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:09,039
Unquestioning and unbreakable.

186
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,416
Who crossed first?

187
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,377
Who crossed last?

188
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,811
You're killing me, man.

189
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,888
When does the good fairy come in?

190
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,715
Never.

191
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,892
It's a story without hope.

192
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:34,064
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

193
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,818
There was an accident.
The family died.

194
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,904
Chenkov was sent to America

195
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,291
<i>to live a complete lie</i>

196
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,537
and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

197
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,247
Day X.

198
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:55,019
The long-awaited mission is here.

199
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,089
Chenkov will travel to New York City

200
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:03,385
to kill the president of Russia

201
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:09,141
at the funeral of
the American vice president.

202
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:14,771
Chenkov is KA 12.

203
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,608
KA.
Cold war legend.

204
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,710
Highly trained Russian sleeper agents

205
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,655
inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

206
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,783
Supposedly they'd wait years
to strike. Decades, even.

207
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,328
Supposedly.

208
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:33,040
What, you don't believe in moles?
I believe in moles, all right.

209
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,541
Just not the bogeyman.

210
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,569
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

211
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,755
This guy's selling smoke.

212
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,340
Wrap it up, Ev.

213
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,936
<i>So a Russian agent is going
to kill the Russian president?</i>

214
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,317
Is that it?

215
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,415
Okay. Okay.

216
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,934
Thank you very much.

217
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,888
And what would you like
in return for that information?

218
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,066
I simply wish to help you do

219
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,352
what you need to do.

220
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,714
You're good.

221
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,994
The KA program is brilliant bullshit.

222
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:14,206
But I'm officially off duty so...

223
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,001
you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

224
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,254
Salt.
Yes?

225
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,858
The name of the Russian agent is Salt.

226
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,386
Evelyn Salt.

227
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,624
My name is Evelyn Salt.

228
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,019
Then you are a Russian spy.

229
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,772
<i>Truthful.</i>

230
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:44,236
So far the FMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

231
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,216
Ted?

232
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,916
Call Protective Services and
make sure they find my husband.

233
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:00,852
I need to get to the phone.
No. No, no, no. Not after the neural scan.

234
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,714
I can beat that thing five times out of six.

235
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,841
I am trained to, and so is he.

236
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,635
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

237
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,788
Let me call my husband.
Let me see it.

238
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,978
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

239
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,104
They don't just blow up their cover

240
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,608
they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

241
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,402
Do you remember Henley's wife?
Yes, I do.

242
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,070
Speaker.

243
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,033
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks. Bye.</i>

244
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,911
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

245
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,121
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

246
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,624
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

247
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,295
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

248
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,465
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

249
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:50,227
I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
I didn't say you were.

250
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,721
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

251
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:55,974
No, no. We gotta go
to a secure location. Now.

252
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,434
All right.

253
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,912
Doesn't get any more secure than this.

254
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,049
Ev? Five minutes.

255
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,187
Call Protective Services, find Mike.
I will.

256
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,322
This is bullshit.

257
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,562
Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

258
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,290
I know we're heading into your jurisdiction.

259
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,251
I'm just asking for five minutes.
No.

260
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,219
If I have to. You can't have
five minutes. I have to talk to her.

261
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,505
She's scared. Don't you see that?
I don't care. I don't care.

262
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,350
There is a mole in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. I am sure.

263
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,407
Please step in the elevator.

264
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:22,060
Russian president, okay? So I'm
gonna ask you to step out of my way.

265
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,902
What the hell is that?

266
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:31,929
Sir.

267
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,565
I gotta pee.

268
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,993
<i>Where do you think he went?</i>

269
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,205
<i>No one saw him coming out the front.</i>

270
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,874
Jesus Christ.
Here he is again.

271
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,877
No sign of him so far on the street.

272
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,838
It's two minutes ago, before lock down.

273
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,432
Anything clean on him?
We just got a match, sir.

274
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,509
It's May Day, 1981.

275
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,886
There's Brezhnev. And there...

276
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,179
Orlov.
That's him.

277
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,224
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

278
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,476
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter,

279
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,688
airport, train station, taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

280
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,624
Get me Medford on a secure line.
Yes, sir.

281
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,903
Top-right screen. Is that live?
Yes, sir.

282
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,405
Where is she going? Track her.

283
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,476
<i>No one may leave the building.</i>

284
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,495
Rink Petroleum, Security.

285
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:06,582
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

286
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,254
We lost the visual on her.
Damn it. Where'd she go?

287
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,256
We are on security lock down.

288
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,259
Dave? It's Evelyn, is Mike there?

289
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,828
<i>No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.</i>

290
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,513
<i>Hey, happy anniversary, huh?</i>

291
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,148
The stairwell.

292
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,059
Second floor.
What's on that floor?

293
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,896
It's empty, a security buffer.
Isolate and seal it.

294
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,363
Get her records to my hand-held.

295
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,942
East corridor.

296
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,552
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

297
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,017
We got her.

298
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,362
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

299
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,697
Yes, sir.
Director Medford, sir.

300
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,199
Get me a side arm.

301
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,827
I'll call her back.

302
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,394
Shit.
Lost visual.

303
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,713
Where is she, Albert?
Talk to me.

304
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,007
Come on.

305
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,725
North hallway.

306
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,251
There, interrogation room, bring it up.

307
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,408
Switch down, switch down.

308
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,415
Have you found him?

309
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,417
<i>What the hell are you doing, Ev?</i>

310
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,752
This doesn't look good.

311
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,670
Let's do it.
Move.

312
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,298
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

313
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,925
Get your panties off the camera.

314
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,260
<i>Get where we can see you
so you don't get hurt.</i>

315
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,430
Have you found my husband?
<i>These boys aren't fooling around him.</i>

316
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,771
<i>Please. I can't help you
unless you talk to me.</i>

317
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,481
Call me when you find Mike.

318
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,942
<i>Sweeping corridors outside the elevator.</i>

319
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,557
Put the masks on.

320
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,116
Situation is hot.

321
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,462
Ok, open the door about two feet.
We 're gonna gas her.

322
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,631
Tac team in position.
Waiting for a go.

323
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,007
Is that absolutely necessary?

324
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,868
What, you want me to shoot her?

325
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,345
Get a medical team in place now.

326
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,569
We're ready.

327
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,991
Now.

328
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,733
<i>Okay, on my count.</i>

329
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,545
Three, two, one. Go.

330
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:29,845
Jesus Christ.

331
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:44,983
Where is she?

332
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:47,017
Come on, guys.

333
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,948
Find her, Albert. Now.
<i>Suspect has escaped.</i>

334
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,159
There. Bring that up.

335
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,080
Stay with her, she's crossing the street.

336
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,749
Pan the goddamn camera.

337
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,387
Back that up and zoom in.

338
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,097
We're looking for Michael Krause.

339
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,724
Freeze.

340
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,185
We're looking for her husband, Mike.

341
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,561
What the hell are you doing, Ev?

342
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,564
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

343
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,359
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

344
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:28,445
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

345
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,364
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes away.

346
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,491
We can cover it, but she won't go there.

347
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:35,327
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

348
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Okay.

349
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,514
Taxi!

350
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,378
U Street. I'll tell you when to stop.

351
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:55,623
<i>Hi, this is Mike. Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

352
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:25,169
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Ev,

353
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:28,588
and as such, enjoys pretty
much unrestricted access

354
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,708
to the borders of North Korea.

355
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,953
So brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

356
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,841
He's the perfect cover to get us inside.

357
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:20,032
Mike?

358
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,069
Mike?

359
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:25,834
Honey?

360
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,404
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

361
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,532
It's all right.

362
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,247
It's okay. Where's Daddy?

363
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:39,881
Where's Daddy?

364
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:15,070
Come on. Come on.

365
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,870
Check for back exits.

366
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:41,831
Go! Go!

367
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,287
Bedroom, clear!

368
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,565
Kitchen is clear.

369
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,061
Office, clear!

370
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,180
Living room, clear!

371
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,601
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

372
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,172
Come here.

373
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,758
What are you doing?

374
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,427
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

375
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:05,097
Did it ever occur to you that
that Russian was lying?

376
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,765
Why'd she run?
I don't know.

377
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:09,852
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

378
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,104
Maybe her husband is in some real danger.

379
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:14,523
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

380
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,358
Maybe is your department.

381
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:18,994
Mine is catching her so we can find out.

382
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,030
Protocol is clear.
We bring her in or we bring her down.

383
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,324
Do you have any idea who this woman is?

384
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,536
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

385
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:28,912
Should it?

386
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,750
Is your mom home?
No.

387
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,544
No? Can you do me a favor?
Yeah.

388
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,880
Hi. You baby-sit Burt for me?

389
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:42,050
Oh, yeah.
Yeah? Here's some money for food.

390
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:43,969
Hi, Burt.

391
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:45,929
What you doing?
You doing homework?

392
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,740
Yeah, math.

393
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,977
Algebra.
I hate math.

394
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,073
Hi. Nice to see you again.

395
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,482
You talking to me?

396
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,840
Yeah, I've seen you here before.

397
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:12,632
Yeah. Yeah, I come here a lot.

398
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,499
You?

399
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,168
Oh, I'm working here.

400
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:17,544
At the museum.

401
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,226
I'm an arachnologist.

402
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,702
A what?

403
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,408
A spider hunter.

404
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,912
You look like one.

405
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:34,269
There are 40,000 species of spiders
in the world.

406
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,981
And that one is mine.

407
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,191
You discovered it.

408
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:40,609
Inside North Korea.

409
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,881
I named it Terrijoolsima peterbesti.

410
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,535
Do you get that?

411
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,579
No. Should I?

412
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:55,415
Peterbesti?
I named it after Pete Best.

413
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,125
The first drummer before Ringo.

414
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:01,163
Best never was a famous Beatle,

415
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:07,302
but now he's a famous spider.

416
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,825
I got her.

417
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:32,144
<i>She's heading north
towards the Metro station.</i>

418
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:34,396
Ev!

419
00:32:58,896 --> 00:32:59,897
Ev!

420
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,651
She's eastbound, in the Penn Quarter Mall.

421
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:17,873
Excuse me.

422
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,054
Will do. Headed there now.

423
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,931
There she is.

424
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:37,392
All teams, southbound
toward the bridge. Box her in.

425
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,321
Circle around!

426
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,240
Salt! Stop!

427
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,700
Keep her in your sights!
Coming up behind you!

428
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:54,944
Fuck!

429
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:01,250
Keep back! Hold your fire!

430
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,627
Salt! Down!

431
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,622
Salt!

432
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,721
Spread out!

433
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,033
Salt!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

434
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,227
On the ground. Now!
Please don't. No!

435
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:22,769
Down! Salt! Do it now!

436
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,851
On the ground!

437
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:24,915
I have to find my husband.

438
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,775
Why'd you run?
I have to find my husband!

439
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,735
That's not a reason.
Please don't shoot.

440
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,279
Stay back!
Last chance.

441
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:32,948
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

442
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:35,450
Don't make me put you down Salt.
Put the gun down!

443
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:36,860
Give yourself up now!
Come on, Ev.

444
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,445
Do what he says.
On the ground!

445
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,885
We'll sort this out, I promise.

446
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,753
I gotta bring you in, Salt.

447
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,605
It's over. Face down.

448
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:46,452
Somebody's going to try to kill
the Russian president, you know that.

449
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:49,380
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

450
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:50,834
There's nowhere to run!

451
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:51,979
Quit now!

452
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,411
No, I didn't do anything.
Get back! No!

453
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,147
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

454
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:07,149
Get a roadblock in place now.

455
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,495
There she is.

456
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,184
On the tanker.

457
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,082
Stop. Stop!

458
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,710
Ev!

459
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,320
You, my friend, have got
a mole in your group.

460
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:36,869
We don't know that yet.

461
00:36:37,183 --> 00:36:39,053
I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar

462
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:41,718
and everything she's said
has been to protect her cover.

463
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,913
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

464
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,057
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

465
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:57,861
Okay, take it down.

466
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,706
Shit!

467
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,044
Shit!

468
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:21,677
Okay.

469
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,171
Ted, I know you're her friend,

470
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,099
but we gotta drop a net on New York.

471
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,652
We gotta do it now.
Let's go!

472
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:36,441
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

473
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:40,062
Tell them Salt might be
coming their way.

474
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:46,243
And if she is, Orlov may
not be far behind either.

475
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,288
You seen this?

476
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:51,874
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

477
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:56,136
She was in a car accident with
her parents in '88. They both died.

478
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:02,384
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy
for the American children of the staff there.

479
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,412
That's why we put her on
Russia in the first place.

480
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,359
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

481
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,870
And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up

482
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:14,665
<i>and preparations are continuing
well into the night</i>

483
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,918
<i>for the funeral of
Vice President Maxwell Oates.</i>

484
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:22,631
<i>Among the dignitaries attending the
service at St. Bartholomew's Church</i>

485
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,259
<i>is Russian president Boris Matveyev,</i>

486
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,928
<i>who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.</i>

487
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:33,058
<i>Public transportation will experience
delays, with subway closures and...</i>

488
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,105
Evelyn.

489
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:40,015
Look at me.

490
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,153
If there was a way, I would kill them.

491
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,950
You shouldn't have come here.

492
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,261
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

493
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,540
Now they know who you are.

494
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,184
Who?

495
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,020
Evelyn.

496
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:03,864
Who?

497
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:08,802
I would accept anything about you,

498
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,721
but I need to know.

499
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,674
So look at me. Look at me.

500
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,245
Just tell me, okay?

501
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,314
Just tell me.

502
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:23,968
I work...

503
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:27,487
I work for the CIA.

504
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,592
So you see, there's...

505
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,313
There's no future for us.

506
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:41,001
You're not safe with me.

507
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:44,205
I don't wanna be safe.

508
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,517
I know you,

509
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:51,253
and I wanna be with you.

510
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:56,050
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

511
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,411
Okay?

512
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,285
Okay.

513
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:04,163
Okay.

514
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:28,590
Welcome to New York, Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

515
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:30,884
Do you need any help with your luggage?

516
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,219
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

517
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,395
I'll put these in the closet, sir?

518
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,188
Yeah, fine.

519
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:12,027
I do solemnly swear

520
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:13,695
I do solemnly swear

521
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:20,869
that I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

522
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,372
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

523
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,333
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

524
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,335
That I will faithfully discharge.

525
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,170
That I will faithfully discharge

526
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,881
the duties of the office
on which I'm about to enter.

527
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:36,093
The duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

528
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,605
So help me God.

529
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:39,268
So help me God.

530
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:47,813
A solemn day here in New York City.

531
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,899
The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates,

532
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:54,778
a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold war warrior

533
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:57,322
whose greatest legacy
may be as architect

534
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:00,584
of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

535
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,953
Russian president Boris Matveyev

536
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,914
has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer

537
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:09,894
to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the west.

538
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:10,079
What's the security perimeter?

539
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:13,690
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

540
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:17,194
And those are Secret
Service agents, not CIA.

541
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:18,435
So relax.

542
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:20,335
That's real funny.

543
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,234
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

544
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,622
Detail, halt.

545
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,043
Forward, march.

546
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:53,814
<i>Due to the funeral,
the 51 st Street station is closed.</i>

547
00:46:57,651 --> 00:47:02,823
<i>Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51 st Street station is closed.</i>

548
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,079
What...? Hey, what's going on?

549
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,664
Hey! There's smoke.

550
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,961
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

551
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:52,748
Eleanor. Good to see you.

552
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,742
Thank you.

553
00:47:57,836 --> 00:48:00,306
Boris.
Mr. President.

554
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,445
Hello.

555
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,767
Please be seated.

556
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,665
<i>Stand by for president's speech.</i>

557
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:40,838
<i>Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.</i>

558
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:43,590
Mrs. Oates.

559
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:48,762
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald...

560
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:53,016
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

561
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,353
If your girl tries anything here,
<i>it'd have to be pretty amazing.</i>

562
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:05,262
I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.

563
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:07,523
As vice president,

564
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:12,436
he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

565
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:14,329
And today,

566
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:19,251
the world says goodbye to a great man.

567
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:29,920
I'll check the back.

568
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,523
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

569
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:01,084
My friendship with Maxwell Oates

570
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:04,254
began in the unlikeliest of places:

571
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,298
<i>Lima Zulu 4, come in.</i>

572
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:08,342
Across the negotiating table...

573
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,260
<i>what's your status, Lima Zulu 4?</i>

574
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:11,637
We got two MIAs.

575
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:16,534
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel outside
the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

576
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,229
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

577
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:22,022
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.

578
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:25,317
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

579
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:26,568
Converge on the crypt.

580
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:28,779
He made all the difference, and for that,

581
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:33,425
he will always have
my respect and admiration.

582
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,624
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

583
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:30,591
What's going on?

584
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:42,678
Matveyev.

585
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:45,022
Get goddamn Matveyev.

586
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:02,831
Get the bomb squad in here!
Go, go!

587
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,248
Drop it!

588
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,292
Drop it!

589
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:57,211
Any MTs down here?
I see her.

590
00:52:57,678 --> 00:53:00,430
Keep your hands up!
Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

591
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:03,851
Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
Don't move!

592
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,228
Do not move! Do not move!
Keep your hands up!

593
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,021
Take her down, take her down!

594
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:09,648
Check for other weapons.

595
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:13,068
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

596
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:15,070
I can't feel a pulse.

597
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,365
Jurisdiction is clear.
This is New York City.

598
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:20,993
N.Y.P.D. has her.
She's going to 1 Police Plaza.

599
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:23,704
I'm not arguing jurisdiction.
We don't know yet, sir.

600
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,456
The shooter is CIA. I know her.
Yes, I'll be there.

601
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,083
I'll be on the next chopper out.

602
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,378
Have your superior call the mayor.
Open up, guy, open up.

603
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,423
Back it up! Back it up!

604
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,451
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

605
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,137
Let's go, let's go.

606
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,930
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

607
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,348
Back up!
Keep moving.

608
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:44,600
Sir, back up!

609
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:46,719
Why? Why?

610
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:51,915
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

611
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:53,567
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

612
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,777
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark hole!

613
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:57,446
Get a hold of yourself.

614
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,615
Get the door, get the door.

615
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:02,451
Get off me!
Back off, man! Back off!

616
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:03,952
That's it. Let's go.

617
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:06,214
Stand back.

618
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:09,767
Close it! Go, go, go!

619
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,974
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

620
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:27,726
Jesus Christ.

621
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:29,311
Yeah.

622
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,247
You were right about her.

623
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:34,750
She had the drop on me, Ted.

624
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:38,237
Why didn't she shoot?

625
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:05,472
<i>Natasha.</i>

626
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:07,850
Natasha.

627
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,568
Is that you?

628
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:13,021
Did they give you a new face?

629
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:16,659
I'm going home tomorrow, Shnaider.

630
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,861
Home to Grozny?

631
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:22,982
My home is in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

632
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:28,912
My favorite place there
is McDonald's on Fern Street

633
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,415
because it's near the river.

634
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,751
But I won't want to go there
anymore

635
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:38,088
because my mother and father
are dead.

636
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,965
Natasha,

637
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,343
will you miss me?

638
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:48,640
My name is Evelyn Salt.

639
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,079
Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

640
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:03,632
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

641
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:06,635
Right now! Hands in the air!

642
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:27,364
Hey, did you see that?
Hey, get those guys over here.

643
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:29,825
Get them over here to help.

644
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,426
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

645
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:24,171
What college will you attend?

646
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:26,215
Princeton University.

647
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:27,549
Where will you work?

648
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:29,718
The Central Intelligence Agency.

649
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:31,637
Who will you trust?

650
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:33,514
No one.

651
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,758
Be very patient.

652
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,935
Remember your training.

653
00:58:38,894 --> 00:58:42,105
Remember, you're not the only one.

654
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:43,899
There are many others.

655
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:47,361
All of you waiting to strike.

656
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:49,613
Yes.
And we will strike.

657
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:53,492
Together.
Yes.

658
00:58:56,078 --> 00:58:57,579
Wait.

659
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:04,253
One day, I will come for all of you.

660
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,094
Hello, Evelyn.

661
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,597
I'm Martin Crenshaw
from the U.S. Embassy.

662
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:19,685
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

663
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:30,612
<i>Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their new leader's words</i>

664
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:34,283
<i>and called on him to take strong
action against what they are calling</i>

665
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:38,078
<i>a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U. S.</i>

666
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,289
<i>These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks</i>

667
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:43,625
<i>of anti-American protests
across Russia.</i>

668
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:46,962
<i>We will strike back,
says the new Russian president,</i>

669
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:49,548
<i>angrily condemning
today's assassination</i>

670
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:53,177
<i>by American intelligence officer
Evelyn Salt.</i>

671
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,347
<i>As the body of slain President
Matveyev is on its way back to Moscow,</i>

672
00:59:57,514 --> 01:00:00,100
<i>anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia,</i>

673
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,978
<i>with bombings of U. S. diplomats'
cars in Moscow.</i>

674
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:07,232
<i>The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.</i>

675
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,444
<i>Responding to a rapidly escalating crisis,</i>

676
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:13,822
<i>President Lewis has called for
an emergency white House meeting</i>

677
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:17,409
<i>with cabinet members, military
leaders and NA TO representatives.</i>

678
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:20,495
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

679
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:29,588
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

680
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:39,723
You were not supposed to get married.

681
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:44,311
Not unless it had
great tactical advantage.

682
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:46,188
I did it to seem normal.

683
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,024
When you escaped today, I thought:

684
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:53,362
Even I could not have hoped
for so much.

685
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:57,407
You are my greatest creation.

686
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:00,344
You trained me well.

687
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:40,367
My husband, you have him?

688
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:42,911
I had to be certain.

689
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:45,163
But now you trust me?

690
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,373
Completely.

691
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:58,510
So tell me what's next.

692
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,013
Next, part two:

693
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:05,517
We seize control of
this country's atomic weapons.

694
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:07,811
How?

695
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,605
You'll see.

696
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,191
All right.

697
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,030
Are you ready to watch him die?

698
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:09,540
Give me the gun.

699
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,460
That would be too easy.

700
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,213
Satisfied?

701
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:17,524
I'm satisfied.

702
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,195
Comrades,

703
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:25,115
our sister has rejoined us.

704
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:28,577
Russia will rise from the ashes

705
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:32,206
of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

706
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:36,043
And the world will hear us!

707
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:37,878
Will hear.

708
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,716
Welcome back to our family, sister.

709
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:46,720
Sister.

710
01:04:54,895 --> 01:05:00,817
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

711
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:07,241
You're to meet an agent,
NATO uniform, at a plane here.

712
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:13,372
Tail number N182SL.

713
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:18,919
Final instructions will come from him.

714
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:22,214
That's it.
That's it.

715
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:25,425
After this, we go dark.

716
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:28,220
Radio silent.

717
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:31,014
You won't hear from me again,

718
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:32,850
my daughter.

719
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,973
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

720
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,540
Have you heard from Orlov?

721
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:03,876
Yes. Last word was go.

722
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,382
Chenkov.

723
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:13,552
Do you remember me?

724
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,017
Chenkov.

725
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:23,061
Did you miss me?

726
01:08:23,604 --> 01:08:24,813
Shnaider?

727
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:30,652
How long have you been here?

728
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:37,117
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

729
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:40,996
I've been the NATO liaison
to the white House for three years.

730
01:08:41,413 --> 01:08:44,082
Colonel Edward Tomas.

731
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,586
And you are my attache.

732
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:49,421
Your ID.

733
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,424
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

734
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:55,511
More importantly, our mission.

735
01:08:55,886 --> 01:09:00,307
The bunker eight stories
below the white House.

736
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:04,019
That's where the president needs to be.

737
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:10,442
How do we do it?

738
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:14,696
Don't worry, he'll be there. That's my job.
I'll make sure he's there.

739
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:16,713
What's my job?

740
01:09:17,727 --> 01:09:19,105
Do you remember, Chenkov,

741
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:22,913
when we were young and you
had to finish first in everything?

742
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,831
Had to be the best at everything.

743
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,744
Though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane, you had to finish first.

744
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:30,796
I remember.

745
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:34,266
Tonight you will finish ahead of me again.

746
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:40,973
Tonight you will kill America's president.

747
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:56,154
IDs, please.

748
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:58,749
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

749
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:00,868
I'll check the side.

750
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:05,163
Control, this is Hayes.

751
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,208
I have a Colonel Tomas and a Major Vicek.

752
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,710
Undercarriage is clean.

753
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:12,004
Back's clean.

754
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:16,133
Colonel. Major. All clear.

755
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:30,748
You know the drill, colonel.

756
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:34,902
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

757
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:38,071
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

758
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,702
Step through, please, sir.

759
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:48,790
Turn around.

760
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:53,879
Thank you.

761
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:01,136
Step through. Arms out.
Patience is key.

762
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:04,389
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here longer.

763
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:06,892
What others?
I don't know.

764
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:10,229
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

765
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:13,857
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

766
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:15,734
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

767
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,110
Major Vicek.
Pleasure.

768
01:11:17,277 --> 01:11:20,197
You'll have minutes to preview NATO's
point of view before the meeting.

769
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,535
Now, Ted, your Russian CI agent, Salt.

770
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,038
What can you tell us about her?
We think she may be a Soviet plant,

771
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:33,919
inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

772
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:38,257
A day marking the start of a large
strike against the U.S. and her allies.

773
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:48,016
This should be the president now.

774
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:53,146
You have a big job, Chenkov,

775
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:54,606
but you can do it.

776
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,109
You still haven't told me what your job is.

777
01:11:57,401 --> 01:11:59,152
Home.

778
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:01,071
I'm going home.

779
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,952
Down! Take cover!
Get the president!

780
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,580
A gun! He's got a gun!
Get back!

781
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:13,208
Get back!

782
01:12:26,638 --> 01:12:27,806
Are you okay, sir?
Yes.

783
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:30,726
Goddamn it.
Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

784
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:37,566
Help, over here!

785
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,154
Get a medic! Get a medic!

786
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:51,330
I think I saw her.

787
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:53,373
You saw who?

788
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:56,327
Salt.

789
01:12:57,753 --> 01:12:59,379
I think I saw her in the corridor.

790
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:03,425
The other NATO officer.

791
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:08,055
She's here.

792
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:10,724
Check.

793
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:12,267
Clear.
Move.

794
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,019
Go!

795
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:16,772
We may have a visual
on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

796
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:20,108
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

797
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:24,571
<i>This is not a drill.
The white House is under attack.</i>

798
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:28,617
<i>If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

799
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,577
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

800
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:33,413
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

801
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:37,709
Command, this is Jenks. I need
the PEOC bunker up and running.

802
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:40,254
If this was authorized
by the Russian government,

803
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,965
it is an act of war, and we will respond.

804
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:48,387
If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.

805
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:50,472
This is not a drill.

806
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:52,207
Clear!
Let's go, sir.

807
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:01,542
Move, move.

808
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:03,944
Close it.

809
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:05,412
Close it.

810
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,622
<i>Please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.</i>

811
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:17,875
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

812
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:50,165
Go, go.

813
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:54,828
Geronimo approaching bunker
door in five seconds.

814
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:00,959
Clear.

815
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:10,219
Any chance she could follow?

816
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:12,471
My own men couldn't get
through that door when is close.

817
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:15,307
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

818
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:20,687
Okay, go.

819
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:24,191
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

820
01:15:28,111 --> 01:15:30,072
Geronimo secured.

821
01:15:58,517 --> 01:16:00,819
Get me Director Medford.
Yes, sir.

822
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:04,398
Sir, I think we need to seriously
consider the possibility

823
01:16:04,565 --> 01:16:07,442
that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

824
01:16:08,151 --> 01:16:10,654
Mr. President, Director Medford is up.

825
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:13,407
Marion, what's the situation?

826
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:16,577
It should be coming up
on one of your screens.

827
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,413
What you see there
represents temperature drops

828
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,748
in mobile missile units in Siberia.

829
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:25,752
It means the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.

830
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:29,206
And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.

831
01:16:30,674 --> 01:16:34,178
Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

832
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:36,463
At least at our forward bases.

833
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:39,558
Do it.

834
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,102
And since the Russians have deployed,

835
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:46,023
we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

836
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,276
It's not on the table, it's not a deterrent.

837
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:53,322
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

838
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:14,735
Sir.

839
01:17:18,138 --> 01:17:21,266
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

840
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:24,186
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

841
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:26,980
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

842
01:17:27,147 --> 01:17:31,734
Command, our eyes are down both ways
and we have a PEOC security door malfunction.

843
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:33,103
Get out there now.

844
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,147
Seal this room.

845
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,117
Down that corridor. Secure it.

846
01:18:32,588 --> 01:18:34,339
This is President Howard Lewis.

847
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:38,143
<i>Proceed with authentication.</i>
Yes, Mr. President.

848
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:44,474
<i>Ready to commence authentication sir.</i>

849
01:18:44,641 --> 01:18:45,642
Zulu.

850
01:18:45,809 --> 01:18:46,852
Tango.
Echo.

851
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:48,020
Seven.
Niner.

852
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:49,396
Juliet.
<i>X-ray.</i>

853
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:50,764
<i>Sierra.
Seven.</i>

854
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:51,932
Alpha.
Mike.

855
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:53,367
Charlie.
Whiskey.

856
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:54,735
<i>Five.
Six.</i>

857
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:55,903
<i>Tango.</i>

858
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,030
<i>Authentication codes confirmed.</i>

859
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:00,574
<i>It's all yours now, Mr. President.</i>

860
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,451
God be with you.

861
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:07,289
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

862
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:09,416
Anders and Nablo, what's your location?

863
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:12,736
<i>Anders and Nablo, what's your location?</i>

864
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:16,136
Is the camera outside this door working?

865
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:17,279
Yes.
Put it up.

866
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:19,476
Officer Dryer, what's your status?

867
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:22,429
Officer Dryer, come in.

868
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:25,290
<i>Federal Communication Commission</i>

869
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:27,601
<i>is activating the Emergency Alert System.</i>

870
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:29,353
Who the hell's that?

871
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:33,065
That's her. That's Evelyn Salt.

872
01:19:33,232 --> 01:19:34,942
She's in. Go to DEFCON 1.

873
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,610
Give me your side arm.

874
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:40,322
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

875
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:42,199
Screw protocol.
We got an enemy agent.

876
01:19:42,366 --> 01:19:43,926
Protocol is protocol, sir.

877
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,496
And dead is dead.

878
01:19:48,247 --> 01:19:49,915
Behind me!

879
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,001
I'm the national security advisor.

880
01:19:53,502 --> 01:19:54,503
Not anymore.

881
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:03,470
Sit down.

882
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:07,850
Who are you?

883
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:11,353
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

884
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:15,107
And unless you do exactly as I say,

885
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,860
I will be the last person you will ever see.

886
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:26,201
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

887
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:27,828
Go to hell.

888
01:20:58,233 --> 01:20:59,651
<i>Ted?</i>

889
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:08,577
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

890
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:10,871
Why didn't you tell me?

891
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:15,667
I tried many times, but...

892
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:19,213
My loneliness was my only friend.

893
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:22,090
You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.

894
01:21:22,257 --> 01:21:24,218
I was a class ahead, comrade.

895
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:26,678
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

896
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:29,765
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

897
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,383
Excuse me.

898
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:35,896

<i>Mecca.</i>

901
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:44,238
Mecca? Tehran?

902
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:46,073
<i>Part two of our plan.</i>

903
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,200
<i>Kill nine million people.</i>

904
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,369
<i>Enrage a billion Muslims.</i>

905
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,372
America will suffer a painful death.

906

<i>maximum yield.</i>

913
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:26,113
You know, when you first came
to Langley,

914
01:22:26,738 --> 01:22:28,899
I didn't think I'd be able to do it.

915
01:22:30,325 --> 01:22:31,886
<i>I didn't think I'd be able to...</i>

916
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:35,698
resist the temptation to say something.

917
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:38,801
Then you met Mike and,

918
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:43,022
well, things changed.

919
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:47,801
Let me join you.

920
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:53,265
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

921
01:23:00,272 --> 01:23:01,607
<i>Let me join you.</i>

922
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:04,484
<i>I want to be with you.</i>

923
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:20,626
<i>The man we thought was dead has made
a resurrection that is miraculous.</i>

924
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,503
<i>President Matveyev is alive.</i>

925
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:24,796
<i>We 're going to Russia.
What you are seeing</i>

926
01:23:24,963 --> 01:23:27,424
<i>are live pictures of
Russian president Matveyev</i>

927
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:31,470
<i>arriving at the airport outside
of Moscow. This is astonishing.</i>

928
01:23:31,637 --> 01:23:34,848
<i>According to his doctors, President
Matveyev's mistaken death</i>

929
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:37,392
<i>is attributed to a temporary paralysis</i>

930
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:40,103
<i>from a toxin derived from spider venom.</i>

931
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:49,738
At least I was right.

932
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:56,119
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

933
01:23:56,411 --> 01:24:00,165
I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

934
01:24:00,332 --> 01:24:02,501
You were supposed to recruit him, Ev,

935
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:04,294
not fall in love with him.

936
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:07,673
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.

937
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:12,427
<i>By the way, how is Mike?</i>

938
01:24:14,388 --> 01:24:16,473
Orlov is dead.

939
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:23,230
Well, that's good news.

940
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,940
Saved me the trouble.

941
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:30,629
<i>I had to practically twist his arm to
get him to blow your cover at the CIA.</i>

942
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:36,326
You see, he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

943
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:41,790
But you needed somebody
to take the blame.

944
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,085
I'm the patsy.

945
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,757
And I'm the hero.

946
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:55,429
Congratulations, Ev.

947
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:59,641

01:27:51,063 --> 01:27:52,439
I said now!

01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:04,868

01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,813
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

964
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:11,291
Mr. President.

965
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:14,945
Mr. President, can you hear me?

966
01:28:16,672 --> 01:28:18,507
Hold still.
EMT's on the way.

967
01:28:18,674 --> 01:28:20,592
Make sure they got body bags.
At least seven.

968
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:22,302
She's wearing a vest.

969
01:28:22,678 --> 01:28:25,472
I'll meet you in five minutes.
I wanna get cleaned up.

970
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:27,224
And I want her alone in a room.

971
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:29,852
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

972
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,067
She won't talk.

973
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:33,602
She's trained not to,
no matter what we do to her.

974
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:36,108
If we're gonna find these people,
I'm gotta do myself.

975
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:38,485
Somebody already did.
At least some of them.

976
01:28:38,652 --> 01:28:41,530
Barge on the East River.
Twelve dead, including Orlov.

977
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:43,365
Who did that?

978
01:28:45,534 --> 01:28:47,536
Don't know. Forensics are on it.

979
01:28:49,413 --> 01:28:51,465
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
I'll be right back.

980
01:28:58,046 --> 01:29:00,718
Well, sir, you're injured.
Why don't you have a seat?

981
01:29:00,932 --> 01:29:02,314
We'll take a look at you.

982
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,720
Are you okay?

983
01:29:05,554 --> 01:29:07,890
Pretty good gash there.

984
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:10,684
Looks like you got a piece
of glass in there.

985
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,776
<i>She killed someone else.</i>

986
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:38,712
<i>It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.</i>

987
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:49,890
Check him. Check him!

988
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:51,725
Checking vitals.

989
01:29:51,892 --> 01:29:54,686
I'm not getting a pulse.
I'm not getting much.

990
01:30:17,876 --> 01:30:19,545
Sit down.

991
01:30:20,796 --> 01:30:23,340
She's yours for 15 minutes during the flight.

992
01:30:23,507 --> 01:30:25,926
Give me your hands.
Then she's the FBl's.

993
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:11,697
Hey.

994
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:14,525
Why'd you kill him?

995
01:31:15,017 --> 01:31:16,518
Because somebody had to.

996
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,116
What?

997
01:31:42,127 --> 01:31:45,047
By this, I take it you think
everybody is who they say they are.

998
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:48,884
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

999
01:31:49,051 --> 01:31:50,469
So did I.

1000
01:31:50,636 --> 01:31:52,930
We just didn't know what it was.

1001
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:55,991
Winter did.
Winter?

1002
01:31:58,227 --> 01:32:01,438
You expect me to believe that Winter
was gonna launch the missiles

1003
01:32:01,605 --> 01:32:03,324
and you saved the world?

1004
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,519
I would like you to believe that, yeah.

1005
01:32:09,655 --> 01:32:11,240
That's a big accusation.

1006
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:13,542
Well...

1007
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:17,579
he's dead now so
he can't defend himself.

1008
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:20,783
I guess you'll just have
to decide for yourself.

1009
01:32:28,215 --> 01:32:30,175
How many more like you
are there?

1010
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:32,127
Like me?

1011
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:34,864
None.

1012
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:37,349
Like him?

1013
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:39,893
More than you or I can handle alone.

1014
01:32:42,604 --> 01:32:45,274
You really think a trained Soviet agent

1015
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:50,028
couldn't kill the Russian president at
point-blank range if she wanted to?

1016
01:32:54,157 --> 01:32:56,451
Or you, for that matter.

1017
01:32:57,119 --> 01:32:59,413
I could've killed you at the funeral and I didn't.

1018
01:32:59,913 --> 01:33:02,457
You surrendered to me
because I gave you no choice.

1019
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:04,543
You know better.

1020
01:33:05,544 --> 01:33:07,796
I had a choice.

1021
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:09,590
You know better.

1022
01:33:29,818 --> 01:33:32,070
If I did believe you,

1023
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:35,733
and I'm not saying for a second
that I do, but if I did,

1024
01:33:37,951 --> 01:33:39,661
nobody else would.

1025
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:44,399
Well, maybe you can
think of a way around that.

1026
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:58,388
They took everything from me.

1027
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,934
I'll kill them.

1028
01:34:15,989 --> 01:34:18,367
ETA, four minutes.

1029
01:34:25,374 --> 01:34:26,458
Bullshit!

1030
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:42,224
We are approaching the Potomac,
heading due south and west.

1031
01:34:47,896 --> 01:34:49,565
Go get them.

1032
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:11,003
Salt!

1033
01:35:19,678 --> 01:35:23,140
Circle back! Circle back!
