2
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:54,832
 Please let me go home.
 Please, l'm not who you think l am.

3
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:58,135
 l'm really not who you think l am.

4
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,506
 Please. Please. l'm not a spy.

5
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,241
 -You are a spy.
 -l'm not a spy.

6
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:05,242
 -Please let me go home.
 -Try again.

7
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:07,380
 l am not a spy.
 l am a businesswoman.

8
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:10,381
 l work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

9
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:13,119
 Please call them.
 l work for Rink Petroleum.

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,120
 You are here to sabotage
 our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

11
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:20,357
 l am not a spy! l am not a spy!

12
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,209
 l am not a spy.

13
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,210
 I am not a spy.

14
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:43,414
 It is through the grace
 and munificence...

15
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,650
 ...of our glorious Dear Leader...

16
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:49,686
 ...that the Democratic People's
 Republic of Korea...

17
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:53,023
 ...has pardoned
 the American imperialist...

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,760
 ...for her hostile acts
 against our socialist nation.

19
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:01,031
 Keep your head down. Don't say
 anything till we make the swap.

20
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,469
 ln case Kim Jong ll here
 changes his mind.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,554
 Exchange.

22
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:24,555
 Right face!

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,261
 Right face!

24
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:31,730
 l don't understand.

25
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:34,731
 You don't understand what?

26
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:38,804
 All the rules say to leave me,
 that one life...

27
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:41,740
 ...is not worth blowing
 operational cover.

28
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,409
 You got that right.

29
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,410
 lf we have to lose someone
 for the greater good, we will.

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,515
 So why did you do it?

31
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:52,516
 Well, l didn't do it.

32
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,420
 He did.

33
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:59,423
 Once he found out where you were,
 there was no stopping him.

34
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:04,196
 He petitioned the Senate,
 the State Department.

35
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:07,197
 We didn't need the publicity
 so l figured we better do something...

36
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:10,434
 ...or he's gonna invade this
 goddamn rice-paddy republic himself.

37
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:30,888
 You okay?

38
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,625
 Yeah.

39
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:20,439
 Hey.

40
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,440
 -Good morning.
 -Happy anniversary.

41
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,246
 You want me to make you breakfast?

42
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:29,848
 How about pancakes?

43
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,084
 Your cooking?

44
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,153
 You're joking. You like my cooking.

45
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:37,154
 Germans don't joke.

46
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:40,157
 Burt likes my cooking.

47
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,534
 Get your bugs off the table.

48
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:51,535
 -They're spiders.
 -They're bugs.

49
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,605
 -They're spiders.
 -They're bugs.

50
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:01,545
 Fold the next layer back
 as you did the two before it.

51
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,782
 Turn the napkin over.
 Fold both sides back...

52
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:09,553
 ...and over one another
 about a third of the way.

53
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:14,057
 Check for symmetry
 and press the fold down well.

54
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:17,363
 Are you doing this
 on company time?

55
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,364
 -And insert your favorite silverware....
 -lt's my anniversary.

56
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,668
 And l want it to be perfect.

57
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,438
 But...

58
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,607
 ...that is not sexy.

59
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,943
 No, but it is utilitarian.

60
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:33,846
 And utilitarian is the new sexy.

61
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:36,847
 l ran the trace. First name Usam,
 last name Utsaev.

62
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,684
 -Any verifiable hits?
 -One.

63
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:41,685
 Hey, Francis, do me a favor and
 stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

64
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,456
 Mata Hari here's
 got a big night tonight.

65
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:46,892
 Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

66
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,893
 ''Sir''? Do l look like a ''sir'' to you?

67
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:51,830
 From head to toe.

68
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:54,466
 l'm surprised he didn't call you
 ''Your Majesty.''

69
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:57,467
 l like the ring of that.
 l think l'd prefer ''Your Majesty.''

70
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:02,673
 Was l ever that young?

71
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,778
 Younger.

72
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,547
 Walk me out.

73
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:10,649
 How did the Oval Office briefing go?

74
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,651
 Oh, you know. The usual.

75
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:15,254
 President wants to know
 what's happening in Russia...

76
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:16,955
 ...the day before it happens.

77
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,358
 How about you?
 l heard that interview went well.

78
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,727
 Fingers crossed.

79
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,662
 You sure about this?

80
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,663
 You know, once you start pushing
 paper, there's no turning back.

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 l had the strangest feeling
 when l was out last time.

82
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,971
 -l was homesick.
 -Homesick?

83
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,972
 -Sir! Sir!
 -Can't you take something for that?

84
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,212
 We got a walk-in.
 A defector, 1 0 minutes ago.

85
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,715
 -Here?
 -l guess he's not buying our cover.

86
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,883
 -Did you get his bona fides?
 -He's Russian.

87
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,453
 He says he's FSB
 but won't give us any more.

88
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,988
 -He's a strange guy.
 -How's his English?

89
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,857
 Passable. Not great.

90
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,858
 But if it got down to
 the subtleties of English nuance....

91
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:57,894
 -Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
 -Yeah, and l got a plane to catch.

92
00:06:58,698 --> 00:06:59,898
 Come on, Salt.

93
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,899
 No one can sort out a nutjob
 from the real thing faster than you.

94
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:06,236
 -l got 25 minutes.
 -l got 26. Let's go.

95
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:15,212
 Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
 when we know more.

96
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:17,883
 -Who called Counterintelligence?
 -Not me.

97
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:20,884
 Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

98
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:25,622
 -Peabody.
 -Salt.

99
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:32,529
 Please remove the hood.

100
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,366
 Microphones are on.

101
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,367
 Checking levels.

102
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:40,737
 Baseline recorded.

103
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:46,443
 Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

104
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,682
 -Ev.
 -Yeah.

105
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:53,683
 Commencing audio
 and visual recording.

106
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:03,794
 Testing earpiece.

107
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:08,465
 lnterview has commenced at 1 442.

108
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:21,378
 You're married.

109
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:24,748
 A husband must be a distraction...

110
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:28,585
 ...for a female intelligence officer.

111
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,190
 Well, we're here to talk about you.

112
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:34,092
 So, what is your name?

113
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,061
 My name is...

114
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:39,062
 ...Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

115
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,004
 l have cancer.

116
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:48,340
 l'm moved.

117
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:51,076
 A defector with cancer.

118
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:54,077
 Are you selling secrets for chemo
 or are you afraid of dying?

119
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:57,714
 lf l have gained anything
 by damning myself...

120
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,819
 ...it is that l no longer
 have anything to fear.

121
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,461
 Russia is also dying.

122
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:12,462
 -But unlike me, she's not dead.
 -Oleg Vassily Orlov...

123
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:16,032
 ...shows up in 1 993
 in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

124
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,404
 He was on Victor Barisovsky's
 staff there.

125
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:20,839
 He checks out as FSB, Ev.

126
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,840
 Scan says he's truthful
 on the cancer.

127
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,544
 Prior to '93?

128
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,545
 -Russia was once strong, powerful....
 -Nothing.

129
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:30,449
 He doesn't exist.

130
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,450
 And she will be again
 when things have been set back...

131
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:36,588
 ...on the correct path.

132
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,491
 l have somewhere l need to be,
 Mr. Orlov...

133
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:42,492
 ...so if you wouldn't mind
 getting to the point.

134
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,231
 l came here to tell you a story.

135
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,570
 l don't like stories.

136
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,273
 But l'll listen anyway.

137
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:56,842
 ln English, please.

138
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:59,144
 Others are listening.

139
00:09:59,145 --> 00:10:02,145
 1 975.

140
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:05,548
 The Cold War.

141
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,553
 In a gymnasium in Grozny...

142
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:10,989
 ...a Soviet Olympic wrestler...

143
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,990
 ...named Sasha Fyorodovich
 Chenkov...

144
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:17,195
 ...meets for the first time...

145
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:20,196
 ...the only female chess grand master
 of her era:

146
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,535
 Anja Nurekyova.

147
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:29,272
 Within a month, they were married.

148
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:32,542
 And within a year, a child.

149
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:35,747
 One month more...

150
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,748
 ...the child was back
 in the same hospital...

151
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:42,953
 ...sick with fever.

152
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:46,425
 And within days after that...

153
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:49,426
 ...the child suddenly was dead.

154
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:55,198
 Yes, a child was dead.

155
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:59,235
 And, yes, a child was buried.

156
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,080
 But the Chenkov baby was alive...

157
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:14,351
 ...and became the property
 of another man.

158
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:19,155
 A master spy who had
 devised the greatest plan...

159
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,460
 ...a Russian patriot
 could ever invent.

160
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,964
 A plan to destroy America.

161
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:32,104
 It had all started...

162
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:35,105
 ...with an American named
 Lee Harvey Oswald.

163
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,209
 In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.

164
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:43,513
 Three years later,
 he returned home.

165
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:46,551
 But the man
 who came back to America...

166
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:49,552
 ...was in fact a Russian spy
 named Alek.

167
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:55,392
 On November 22nd, 1963...

168
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:59,129
 ...Alek became the first success
 of the new program...

169
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,767
 ...and a hero of the Soviet Union.

170
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:07,704
 The spymaster was now
 given the go-ahead...

171
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,807
 ...to create many more like Alek.

172
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,810
 Scores of agents,
 males and females...

173
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:17,215
 ...to be substituted for Americans.

174
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:20,216
 l pledge allegiance to the flag....

175
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:23,388
 At an abandoned monastery...

176
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:26,389
 ... Chenkov and other boys and girls
 learned English...

177
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:30,028
 ...long before they learned Russian.

178
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,330
 Drilled in idiom...

179
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:35,331
 ...idiosyncrasy and...

180
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:38,370
 ...ideology.

181
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:41,371
 And by methods of rigorous physical
 and psychological programming...

182
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:46,443
 ...the spymaster
 made warriors of iron.

183
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,679
 Unquestioning and unbreakable.

184
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:54,019
 You're killing me, man.

185
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,354
 When does the good fairy come in?

186
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,190
 Never.

187
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,425
 lt's a story without hope.

188
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:03,426
 Chenkov was matched with the child
 of a visiting American family.

189
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:08,264
 There was an accident.
 The family died.

190
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:12,001
 Chenkov was sent to America...

191
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,105
 ...to live a complete lie...

192
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,675
 ...and to patiently await the day
 to attack from within.

193
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,013
 Day X.

194
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:25,014
 The long-awaited mission is here.

195
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,120
 Chenkov will travel
 to New York City...

196
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:33,256
 ...to kill the president of Russia...

197
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:38,361
 ...at the funeral of
 the American vice president.

198
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,367
 Chenkov is KA 1 2.

199
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,807
 -''KA.''
 -Cold War legend.

200
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:50,809
 Highly trained
 Russian sleeper agents...

201
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,810
 ...inserted into American society
 to sabotage and assassinate.

202
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:57,847
 Supposedly they'd wait years
 to strike. Decades, even.

203
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,019
 Supposedly.

204
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,020
 -What, you don't believe in moles?
 -l believe in moles, all right.

205
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:05,757
 Just not the bogeyman.

206
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,758
 Especially if the plan is
 to kill their own president.

207
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,962
 This guy's selling smoke.

208
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:13,665
 Wrap it up, Ev.

209
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,666
 So a Russian agent is going to kill
 the Russian president? ls that it?

210
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,339
 Okay.

211
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,642
 Thank you very much.

212
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:26,643
 And what would you like
 in return for that information?

213
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,282
 l simply wish to help you do...

214
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:33,283
 ...what you need to do.

215
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:38,188
 You're good.

216
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:41,324
 The KA program
 is brilliant bullshit.

217
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:45,630
 But l'm officially off duty...

218
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:48,631
 ...so you can tell the rest of your
 little story to one of my colleagues.

219
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:51,803
 -Salt.
 -Yes?

220
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:54,804
 The name of the Russian agent
 is Salt.

221
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,409
 Evelyn Salt.

222
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,847
 My name is Evelyn Salt.

223
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:07,984
 Then you are a Russian spy.

224
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,255
 Truthful.

225
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:13,256
 So far the fMRl scan registers truthful
 on everything he's said.

226
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,198
 Ted?

227
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:29,140
 Call Protective Services,
 make sure they find my husband.

228
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:31,977
 -l need to get to the phone.
 -Not after the neural scan.

229
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,913
 l can beat that thing
 five times out of six.

230
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,349
 l am trained to, and so is he.

231
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,918
 l need my phone.
 l need to call my husband.

232
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,919
 -Let me call my husband.
 -Let me see it.

233
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:49,194
 There's a reason he mentioned
 my wedding ring, Ted.

234
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:51,129
 They don't just blow up
 their cover...

235
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,798
 ...they blow up their whole cover life.
 You know that.

236
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,799
 -Do you remember Henley's wife?
 -Yes, l do.

237
00:15:56,869 --> 00:15:59,037
 Speaker.

238
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:02,038
 Please leave a message
 after the tone. Thanks. Bye.

239
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:05,110
 Honey, it's me. Please call me
 as soon as you get this.

240
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,312
 Okay, sweetheart?
 As soon as you get this.

241
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:10,313
 Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

242
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,583
 Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
 Someone who enjoys getting answers.

243
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,656
 Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

244
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:20,657
 -l'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
 -l didn't say you were.

245
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,928
 Let's go up to my office,
 we can sort this out.

246
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:26,929
 No, no. We gotta go to
 a secure location. Now.

247
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,833
 All right.

248
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,636
 Doesn't get any more secure
 than this.

249
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,637
 Ev? Five minutes.

250
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:38,775
 -Call Protective Services, find Mike.
 -l will.

251
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:42,712
 This is bullshit.

252
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:48,818
 Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

253
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:51,489
 l know we're heading
 into your jurisdiction.

254
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,490
 -l'm just asking for five minutes.
 -No.

255
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:03,266
 lf l have to. You can't have
 five minutes. l have to talk to her.

256
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:06,004
 -She's scared. Don't you see that?
 -l don't care.

257
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:09,005
 There is a mole in Russia house, Ted.
 There is a mole. l am sure.

258
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:25,421
 Please step in the elevator.

259
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:52,715
 --Russian president, okay? So l'm
 gonna ask you to step out of my way.

260
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:01,893
 What the hell is that?

261
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:04,894
 Sir.

262
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,628
 -Where do you think he went?
 -No one saw him coming out the front.

263
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,968
 -Jesus Christ.
 -Here he is again.

264
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:46,671
 No sign of him so far on the street.

265
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,606
 lt's two minutes ago,
 before lockdown.

266
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:51,409
 -Anything clean on him?
 -We just got a match, sir.

267
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,278
 lt's May Day, 1 981 .

268
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,647
 There's Brezhnev. And there....

269
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:56,948
 -Orlov.
 -That's him.

270
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:59,949
 He used to be a heavyweight
 once upon a time.

271
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,253
 Get that photo out.
 Every ticket counter...

272
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:05,254
 ...airport, train station, taxi dispatcher,
 the whole nine yards.

273
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,458
 -Get me Medford on a secure line.
 -Yes, sir.

274
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:12,664
 -Top-right screen. ls that live?
 -Yes, sir.

275
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:15,665
 Where is she going? Track her.

276
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,001
 No one may leave the building.

277
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,272
 Rink Petroleum, Security.

278
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:24,273
 Yes, you have a woman to your left,
 behind you. Evelyn Salt.

279
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:29,846
 -We lost the visual on her.
 -Damn it. Where'd she go?

280
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:32,851
 We are on security lockdown.

281
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:35,086
 Dave? lt's Evelyn, is Mike there?

282
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:37,555
 No, I', sorry. He left after lunch.

283
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:39,290
 Hey, happy anniversary, huh?

284
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,359
 The stairwell.

285
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,828
 -Second floor.
 -What's on that floor?

286
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:46,829
 -lt's empty, a security buffer.
 -lsolate and seal it.

287
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,373
 Get her records to my handheld.

288
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:01,143
 East corridor.

289
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:08,918
 Notifying Metropolitan Police.

290
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:19,328
 Kill the power to the elevator doors.

291
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:26,037
 We got her.

292
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:27,438
 Locking down all floors.

293
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,439
 Security Protective Service
 responding to threat.

294
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:35,511
 All right. Get a tactical team
 to meet me on the south stairwell.

295
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,483
 -Yes, sir.
 -Director Medford, sir.

296
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:41,484
 Get me a side arm.

297
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:45,187
 l'll call her back.

298
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:51,627
 -Shit.
 -Lost visual.

299
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:55,099
 Where is she, Albert? Talk to me.

300
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,100
 Come on.

301
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:07,443
 North hallway.

302
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,727
 There, interrogation room,
 bring it up.

303
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:04,734
 Switch down, switch down.

304
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:13,042
 -Have you found him?
 -What the hell are you doing, Ev?

305
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:15,046
 This doesn't look good.

306
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,681
 -Let's do it.
 -Move.

307
00:22:16,682 --> 00:22:19,083
 There's a tac team coming at you
 in 30 seconds.

308
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,718
 Get your panties off the camera.

309
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:23,054
 Get where we can see you
 so you don't get hurt.

310
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:26,055
 -Have you found my husband?
 -These boys aren't fooling around.

311
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:33,531
 Please. I can't help you
 unless you talk to me.

312
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,733
 Call me when you find Mike.

313
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,734
 Sweeping corridors
 outside the elevator.

314
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,676
 Put the masks on.

315
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:47,677
 Situation is hot.

316
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:58,256
 Open the door about two feet.
 We're gonna gas her.

317
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:01,257
 -Tac team in position. Waiting for a go.
 -ls that absolutely necessary?

318
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:03,895
 What, you want me to shoot her?

319
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:06,896
 Get a medical team in place now.

320
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:22,545
 We're ready.

321
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:28,617
 Now.

322
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,626
 Okay, on my count.

323
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:38,627
 Three, two, one. Go.

324
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:49,038
 Jesus Christ.

325
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:04,286
 Where is she? Come on, guys.

326
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,690
 -Find her, Albert. Now.
 -Suspect has escaped.

327
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,960
 There. Bring that up.

328
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:14,866
 Stay with her,
 she's crossing the street.

329
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,867
 Pan the goddamn camera.

330
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:30,481
 Back that up and zoom in.

331
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:33,482
 -We're looking for Michael Krause.
 -Freeze.

332
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:36,852
 -We're looking for her husband, Mike.
 -What the hell are you doing, Ev?

333
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:38,022
 Wait, when was that?
 No. No message.

334
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:40,591
 Wait, when was that?
 No. No message.

335
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:43,127
 Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

336
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:46,128
 Michael Krause left his office
 at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

337
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,132
 Salt's apartment is 20 minutes away.

338
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,268
 We can cover it,
 but she won't go there.

339
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:53,104
 She will if she's serious about Mike.
 This stays in-house.

340
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,806
 Okay.

341
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:57,807
 Taxi!

342
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:03,078
 U Street. l'll tell you when to stop.

343
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:12,822
 Hi, this is Mike. Please leave
 a message after the tone.

344
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,954
 He's one of the world's
 top arachnologists, Ev...

345
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:45,955
 ...and as such, enjoys pretty much
 unrestricted access...

346
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:48,793
 ...to the borders of North Korea.

347
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:51,794
 So brush up on your bugs
 and get to know him.

348
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:56,966
 He's the perfect cover
 to get us inside.

349
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,541
 Mike?

350
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,612
 Mike? Honey?

351
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:52,189
 Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

352
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,358
 lt's all right.

353
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,359
 lt's okay. Where's Daddy?
 Where's Daddy?

354
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:32,661
 Come on. Come on.

355
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:39,969
 Check for back exits.

356
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:59,922
 Go! Go!

357
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:05,694
 Bedroom, clear!

358
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:09,365
 Kitchen is clear.

359
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,603
 Office, clear!

360
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:15,604
 Living room, clear!

361
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

362
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,632
 Come here.

363
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,200
 What are you doing?

364
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:18,869
 She's not here.
 No sign of the husband either.

365
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,539
 Did it ever occur to you that
 that Russian was lying?

366
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,207
 -Why'd she run?
 -l don't know.

367
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:26,208
 Because you were gonna lock her up?
 See it from her perspective.

368
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,546
 Maybe her husband
 is in some real danger.

369
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:31,015
 Maybe, God forbid,
 Salt is who she says she is.

370
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,817
 ''Maybe'' is your department.

371
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,653
 Mine is catching her
 so we can find out.

372
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:38,489
 Protocol is clear. We bring her in
 or we bring her down.

373
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,758
 Do you have any idea
 who this woman is?

374
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,759
 What she's done for this country?
 Does that mean anything to you?

375
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:46,995
 Should it?

376
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,201
 -ls your mom home?
 -No.

377
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:51,969
 -No? Can you do me a favor?
 -Yeah.

378
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,305
 Hi. You babysit Burt for me?

379
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:57,306
 -Oh, yeah.
 -Yeah? Here's some money for food.

380
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:00,411
 Hi, Burt.

381
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:03,412
 -What you doing? Doing homework?
 -Yeah, math.

382
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,450
 -Algebra.
 -l hate math.

383
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,865
 Hi. Nice to see you again.

384
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:27,402
 -You talking to me?
 -Yeah, l've seen you here before.

385
00:30:27,873 --> 00:30:30,873
 Yeah, l do. l come here a lot.

386
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:33,377
 You?

387
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:35,579
 Oh, l'm working here.

388
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,482
 At the museum.

389
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:41,483
 -l'm an arachnologist.
 -A what?

390
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:45,454
 I hunt spiders.

391
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:00,037
 l got her.

392
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,038
 She's heading north
 towards the Metro station.

393
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:06,475
 Ev!

394
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,967
 Ev!

395
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:43,545
 She's eastbound,
 in the Penn Quarter Mall.

396
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:49,918
 Excuse me.

397
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:03,732
 -Will do. Headed there now.
 -There she is.

398
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:07,569
 All teams, southbound
 toward the bridge. Box her in.

399
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,583
 Circle around!

400
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,452
 Salt! Stop!

401
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:23,921
 -Keep her in your sights!
 -Coming up behind you!

402
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:26,922
 Fuck!

403
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:31,829
 Keep back! Hold your fire!

404
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,830
 Salt! Down!

405
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,333
 Salt!

406
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:45,876
 Spread out!

407
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:48,178
 -Salt!
 -Don't shoot! Don't shoot, l'm innocent!

408
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,447
 -On the ground. Now!
 -Please don't. No!

409
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:53,448
 Down! Salt! Do it now!
 On the ground!

410
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,052
 l have to find my husband.

411
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:56,987
 -Why'd you run?
 -To find my husband!

412
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:58,956
 -That's not a reason.
 -Don't shoot.

413
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:00,491
 -Stay back!
 -Last chance.

414
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:03,193
 l'm innocent.
 Somebody is setting me up!

415
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:05,696
 -Don't make me put you down.
 -Put the gun down!

416
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:07,431
 -Give yourself up!
 -Come on, Ev.

417
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:10,234
 Do what he says.
 We'll sort this out, l promise.

418
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:13,235
 l gotta bring you in, Salt.
 lt's over. Face down.

419
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:16,307
 Somebody's going to try to
 kill the Russian president.

420
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:19,308
 Do something about that!
 That's what you should worry about.

421
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:21,712
 There's nowhere to run! Quit now!

422
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,180
 No, l didn't do anything.

423
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:23,380
 Get back! No!

424
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:26,381
 Get back! No!

425
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:35,359
 She's on a blue semi.
 Route 1 , heading north.

426
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,360
 Get a roadblock in place now.

427
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:52,307
 Metro Police on alert.

428
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:32,314
 There she is. On the tanker.

429
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:36,118
 Stop. Stop!

430
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,530
 Ev!

431
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:05,816
 You, my friend, have got
 a mole in your group.

432
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:08,817
 -We don't know that yet.
 -l'd say she's a trained goddamn liar...

433
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,855
 ...and everything she's said
 has been to protect her cover.

434
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:14,856
 Well, why don't you tell me
 how you really feel about it?

435
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:07,876
 Get up on the shoulder!
 Get up on the shoulder!

436
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:29,831
 Okay, take it down.

437
00:36:38,643 --> 00:36:41,643
 Shit!

438
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,081
 Shit!

439
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:52,256
 Okay.

440
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:55,225
 Ted, l know you're her friend...

441
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:57,528
 ...but we gotta drop a net
 on New York.

442
00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:00,529
 -We gotta do it now.
 -Let's go!

443
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:06,067
 Notify the Secret Service
 on Matveyev's detail.

444
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,872
 Tell them Salt might be
 coming their way.

445
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:14,776
 And if she is,
 Orlov may not be far behind either.

446
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:19,516
 You seen this?

447
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:22,352
 Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

448
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:25,353
 She was in a car accident with
 her parents in '88. They both died.

449
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:29,927
 They were teachers
 at the U.S. Embassy...

450
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:32,863
 ...for the American children
 of the staff.

451
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,864
 That's why we put her on Russia
 in the first place.

452
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:40,302
 We need to get on a plane
 to New York, tonight.

453
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:33,488
 And here in New York City,
 security has been beefed up...

454
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:36,593
 ...and preparations are continuing
 well into the night...

455
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:39,594
 ...for the funeral of
 Vice President Maxwell Oates.

456
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:42,831
 Among the dignitaries attending the
 service at St. Bartholomew's Church...

457
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:47,170
 ...is Russian president
 Boris Matveyev...

458
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:49,840
 ...who arrived here in Manhattan
 earlier this evening.

459
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,841
 Public transportation will experience
 delays, with subway closures and....

460
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,317
 Evelyn.

461
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:03,318
 Look at me.

462
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:07,589
 lf there was a way, l would kill them.

463
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:11,895
 You shouldn't have come here.

464
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:14,896
 What do you mean?
 l don't understand.

465
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:18,735
 Now they know who you are.

466
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:21,338
 Who?

467
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,339
 Evelyn.

468
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,375
 Who?

469
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:30,714
 l would accept anything about you...

470
00:39:30,715 --> 00:39:32,649
 ...but l need to know.

471
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,650
 So look at me. Look at me.

472
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:40,722
 Just tell me, okay?

473
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:43,958
 Just tell me.

474
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:47,595
 l work....

475
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:50,732
 l work for the ClA.

476
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:54,769
 So you see, there's....

477
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:57,806
 There's no future for us.

478
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:03,244
 You're not safe with me.

479
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:07,115
 l don't wanna be safe.

480
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:11,121
 l know you...

481
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:14,122
 ...and l wanna be with you.

482
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,559
 l want to spend the rest of my life
 with you.

483
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:22,999
 Okay?

484
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Okay. Okay.

485
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:47,991
 Welcome to New York,
 Miss Hernandez.

486
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:50,827
 -One night, a deluxe room.
 -Yep.

487
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,796
 Do you need any help
 with your luggage?

488
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,797
 Nope, l got it. Thanks.

489
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:04,005
 -l'll put these in the closet, sir?
 -Yeah, fine.

490
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:42,772
 A solemn day here
 in New York City.

491
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:45,773
 The funeral of Vice President
 Maxwell Oates...

492
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:48,843
 ...a former five-term U.S. senator
 and Cold War warrior...

493
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:52,282
 ...whose greatest legacy
 may be as architect...

494
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:55,283
 ...of the new era
 of Russian-American relations.

495
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:57,921
 Russian president Boris Matveyev...

496
00:42:57,922 --> 00:43:00,857
 ...hasjourneyed from Moscow
 to be an honorary pallbearer...

497
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:03,858
 ...to the man he's called
 his greatest friend in the West.

498
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:05,455
 What's the security perimeter?

499
00:44:05,456 --> 00:44:08,456
 We're two deep inside
 and we own this entire block.

500
00:44:08,693 --> 00:44:11,693
 And those are Secret Service agents,
 not ClA.

501
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:15,163
 -So relax.
 -That's real funny.

502
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,200
 Didn't know you guys told jokes.

503
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:25,306
 Detail, halt.

504
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:28,676
 Forward, march.

505
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:47,729
 Due to the funeral,
 the 51st Street station is closed.

506
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,470
 Repeat: Due to the funeral,
 the 51st Street station is closed.

507
00:45:01,946 --> 00:45:04,080
 What--? Hey, what's going on?

508
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:07,081
 Hey! There's smoke.

509
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:10,718
 Step back, step back.
 Everybody, move out of the way.

510
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:48,124
 Eleanor. Good to see you.

511
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,125
 Thank you.

512
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:55,663
 -Boris.
 -Mr. President.

513
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:03,137
 Hello.

514
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:15,683
 Please be seated.

515
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:29,897
 Stand by for president's speech.

516
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:34,202
 Patrolling church exterior.
 No one in or out the side doors.

517
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:39,976
 Mrs. Oates.

518
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:42,977
 Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald....

519
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:46,747
 After the president, the choir sings,
 then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

520
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:50,985
 lf your girl tries anything here,
 it'd have to be pretty amazing.

521
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:58,559
 l knew he would bring more to the job
 than just his years of experience.

522
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:02,799
 As vice president...

523
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,800
 ...he showed the world the best
 of what it is to be an American.

524
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:09,305
 And today...

525
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:12,306
 ...the world says goodbye
 to a great man.

526
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,188
 l'll check the back.

527
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:28,189
 Lima Zulu 4, clear.

528
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:56,085
 My friendship with Maxwell Oates...

529
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:59,086
 ...began in the unlikeliest of places:

530
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:02,256
 -Lima Zulu 4, come in.
 -Across the negotiating table....

531
00:48:02,927 --> 00:48:05,261
 What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?

532
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:06,629
 We got two MlAs.

533
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,630
 Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel outside
 the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

534
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:14,902
 l'm heading down to the crypt.
 Some kind of trouble down there.

535
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:17,006
 What's going on, guys? Talk to me.

536
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:20,007
 Subunits Lima Zulu 1 , 2 and 3,
 converge on the crypt. Repeat:

537
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:21,544
 Converge on the crypt.

538
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:23,780
 He made all the difference,
 and for that...

539
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:26,781
 ...he will always have
 my respect and admiration.

540
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:17,298
 That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
 would have said.

541
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:27,241
 What's going on?

542
00:49:36,253 --> 00:49:38,655
 Matveyev.

543
00:49:38,656 --> 00:49:41,656
 Get goddamn Matveyev.

544
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:57,972
 -Get the bomb squad in here!
 -Go, go!

545
00:50:37,348 --> 00:50:40,348
 Drop it!

546
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:44,085
 Drop it!

547
00:50:49,026 --> 00:50:52,026
 -Any MTs down here?
 -l see her.

548
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:55,398
 -Keep your hands up!
 -Shooter's at 1 2 o'clock.

549
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:58,399
 -Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
 -Don't move!

550
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:01,204
 -Do not move! Do not move!
 -Keep your hands up!

551
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:04,205
 -Take her down, take her down!
 -Check for other weapons.

552
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:08,044
 We need a medical crew
 in the crypt immediately.

553
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:11,045
 l can't feel a pulse.

554
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:13,082
 Back it up! Back it up!

555
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:16,083
 Come on, guys. Keep moving.
 Keep moving. Keep moving.

556
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:18,988
 Let's go, let's go.

557
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:20,857
 Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

558
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:22,058
 -Back up!
 -Keep moving.

559
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:23,493
 Sir, back up!

560
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:26,494
 Why? Why?!

561
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:30,700
 Do you have any idea
 how much blood is on your hands?

562
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:32,435
 You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

563
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:34,637
 l'm gonna see to it personally!
 A dark hole!

564
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:36,806
 Get ahold of yourself.

565
00:51:36,807 --> 00:51:38,474
 Get the door, get the door.

566
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:41,310
 -Get off me!
 -Back off, man! Back off!

567
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,746
 That's it. Let's go.

568
00:51:43,747 --> 00:51:46,349
 Stand back.

569
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,350
 Close it! Go, go, go!

570
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:04,131
 Matveyev was declared dead
 en route to the hospital.

571
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:06,869
 Jesus Christ.

572
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,304
 Yeah.

573
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:11,305
 You were right about her.

574
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:14,341
 She had the drop on me, Ted.

575
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:18,212
 Why didn't she shoot?

576
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:13,434
 Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

577
00:54:01,018 --> 00:54:04,018
 Get out of the car
 with your hands on your head!

578
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:08,489
 Right now! Hands in the air!

579
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:28,342
 -Hey, did you see that?
 -Hey, get those guys over here.

580
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:32,179
 Get them over here to help.

581
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:49,496
 Somebody help me get him out.
 Help me get him out.

582
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:22,498
 What is your name?

583
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:25,201
 My name is Evelyn Salt.

584
00:55:25,202 --> 00:55:27,069
 What college will you attend?

585
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,105
 Princeton University.

586
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:32,106
 -Where will you work?
 -The Central lntelligence Agency.

587
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,543
 Who will you trust?

588
00:55:34,544 --> 00:55:36,412
 No one.

589
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:38,948
 Be very patient.

590
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:41,617
 Remember your training.

591
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:44,618
 Remember, you're not the only one.

592
00:55:45,022 --> 00:55:46,789
 There are many others.

593
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:49,790
 All of you waiting to strike.

594
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,062
 -Yes.
 -And we will strike.

595
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:56,063
 -Together.
 -Yes.

596
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:01,835
 Wait.

597
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:06,073
 One day, l will come for all of you.

598
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:15,184
 Hello, Evelyn.

599
00:56:15,185 --> 00:56:18,185
 l'm Martin Crenshaw
 from the U.S. Embassy.

600
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:22,022
 We're very sorry about
 your family's accident.

601
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:32,499
 Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
 cheered their new leader's words...

602
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:36,503
 ...and called on him to take strong
 action against what they are calling...

603
00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:40,174
 ...a state-sponsored act of terrorism
 on the part of the U.S.

604
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:43,279
 These riots are sparking
 similar outbreaks...

605
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,280
 ...of anti-American protests
 across Russia.

606
00:56:46,616 --> 00:56:49,616
 ''We will strike back, ''
 says the new Russian president...

607
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,521
 ...angrily condemning
 today's assassination...

608
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:55,522
 ...by American intelligence officer
 Evelyn Salt.

609
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:58,527
 As the body of slain
 President Matveyev...

610
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:00,329
 ...is on its way back to Moscow...

611
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:03,065
 ...anti-American riots
 have erupted across Russia...

612
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:06,066
 ...with bombings of U.S. diplomats'
 cars in Moscow.

613
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:10,137
 The Russian armed forces
 have been put on high alert.

614
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:13,409
 Responding to
 a rapidly escalating crisis...

615
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,410
 ...President Lewis has called for an
 emergency White House meeting...

616
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:19,813
 ...with cabinet members, military
 leaders and NA TO representatives.

617
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,383
 Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

618
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:32,459
 When l saw you in Washington,
 l almost ran to you.

619
00:57:39,803 --> 00:57:42,705
 You were not supposed
 to get married.

620
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:45,706
 Not unless it had
 great tactical advantage.

621
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:49,812
 l did it to seem normal.

622
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:51,981
 When you escaped today, l thought:

623
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:54,982
 ''Even l could not have hoped
 for so much.''

624
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:59,586
 You are my greatest creation.

625
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:04,391
 You trained me well.

626
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:43,030
 My husband, you have him?

627
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:45,901
 l had to be certain.

628
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:48,137
 But now you trust me?

629
00:58:48,138 --> 00:58:51,138
 Completely.

630
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,281
 So...

631
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:01,584
 ...tell me what's next.

632
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:04,320
 Next, part two:

633
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:07,321
 We seize control of
 this country's atomic weapons.

634
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:11,327
 How?

635
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:13,762
 You'll see.

636
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:16,763
 All right.

637
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:32,239
 Satisfied?

638
01:00:33,009 --> 01:00:36,009
 l'm satisfied.

639
01:00:36,012 --> 01:00:37,680
 Comrades...

640
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:40,681
 ...our sister has rejoined us.

641
01:00:41,685 --> 01:00:44,685
 Russia will rise from the ashes...

642
01:00:44,955 --> 01:00:47,955
 ...of the greatest war
 the world has ever seen.

643
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:52,895
 And the world will hear us!

644
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:55,896
 Will hear.

645
01:00:57,067 --> 01:01:00,067
 Welcome back to our family, sister.

646
01:01:01,871 --> 01:01:04,871
 Sister.

647
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,380
 Russia has changed.
 But our lives will not be wasted.

648
01:01:18,154 --> 01:01:21,154
 You're to meet an agent,
 NATO uniform, at a plane here.

649
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:26,493
 Tail number N1 82SL.

650
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:33,266
 Final instructions
 will come from him.

651
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:38,240
 -That's it.
 -That's it.

652
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:41,241
 After this, we go dark.

653
01:01:41,644 --> 01:01:44,644
 Radio silent.

654
01:01:44,748 --> 01:01:47,082
 You won't hear from me again...

655
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:50,083
 ...my daughter.

656
01:03:44,901 --> 01:03:47,901
 Forever and ever.

657
01:04:10,627 --> 01:04:13,162
 Have you heard from Orlov?

658
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:16,163
 Yes. Last word was ''go.''

659
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:23,170
 Chenkov.

660
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:26,439
 Do you remember me?

661
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:32,915
 Chenkov.

662
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:35,117
 Did you miss me?

663
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:38,118
 Shnaider?

664
01:04:40,857 --> 01:04:43,857
 How long have you been here?

665
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:47,561
 l left Russia one year after you.
 To Prague.

666
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:51,865
 l've been the NATO liaison
 to the White House for three years.

667
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:55,902
 Colonel Edward Tomas.

668
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:58,905
 And you are my attach.

669
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:01,577
 Your lD.

670
01:05:01,578 --> 01:05:04,112
 Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

671
01:05:04,113 --> 01:05:07,113
 More importantly, our mission.

672
01:05:07,383 --> 01:05:10,383
 The bunker eight stories
 below the White House.

673
01:05:13,756 --> 01:05:16,756
 That's where the president
 needs to be.

674
01:05:20,763 --> 01:05:23,265
 -How do we do it?
 -Don't worry, he'll be there.

675
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:26,266
 That's my job.
 l'll make sure he's there.

676
01:05:27,036 --> 01:05:30,036
 -What's my job?
 -Do you remember, Chenkov...

677
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:33,673
 ...when we were young and you
 had to finish first in everything?

678
01:05:34,577 --> 01:05:36,545
 Had to be the best at everything.

679
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:39,546
 Though you knew you would be beaten
 with a cane, you had to finish first.

680
01:05:40,717 --> 01:05:42,451
 l remember.

681
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:45,452
 Tonight you will finish
 ahead of me again.

682
01:05:48,691 --> 01:05:51,691
 Tonight you will kill
 America's president.

683
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:08,310
 lDs, please.

684
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:10,812
 Pop the hood and open the trunk.

685
01:06:10,813 --> 01:06:13,813
 l'll check the side.

686
01:06:15,618 --> 01:06:16,852
 Control, this is Hayes.

687
01:06:16,853 --> 01:06:19,853
 l have a Colonel Tomas
 and a Major Vicek.

688
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:22,491
 Undercarriage is clean.

689
01:06:22,492 --> 01:06:24,926
 Back's clean.

690
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:27,927
 Colonel. Major. All clear.

691
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:43,176
 You know the drill, colonel.

692
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:46,581
 Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

693
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:49,582
 They've spent more time looking at it
 than the doctor did.

694
01:06:53,089 --> 01:06:56,089
 Step through, please, sir.

695
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:02,128
 Turn around.

696
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:06,766
 Thank you.

697
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:12,808
 -Step through. Arms out.
 -Patience is key.

698
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:15,809
 l've been coming here for two years,
 others have been here longer.

699
01:07:16,045 --> 01:07:18,547
 -What others?
 -l don't know.

700
01:07:18,548 --> 01:07:21,548
 But you were the best of us
 and l was the least.

701
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:24,918
 There must be others,
 here to finish what we begin.

702
01:07:25,521 --> 01:07:27,422
 Colonel Tomas.
 Good to see you again.

703
01:07:27,423 --> 01:07:28,790
 -Major Vicek.
 -Pleasure.

704
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:31,791
 You'll have minutes to preview NATO's
 point of view before the meeting.

705
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:36,196
 Now, Ted, your Russian
 Cl agent, Salt.

706
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:39,199
 -What can you tell us about her?
 -We think she may be a Soviet plant...

707
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,570
 ...inserted years ago in preparation
 for something the KGB called Day X.

708
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:48,608
 A day marking the start of a large
 strike against the U.S. and her allies.

709
01:07:57,253 --> 01:08:00,253
 This should be the president now.

710
01:08:02,425 --> 01:08:04,826
 You have a big job, Chenkov...

711
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:06,428
 ...but you can do it.

712
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:08,897
 You still haven't told me
 what your job is.

713
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:10,966
 Home.

714
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:13,967
 l'm going home.

715
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:19,040
 -Down! Take cover!
 -Get the president!

716
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:22,041
 -A gun! He's got a gun!
 -Get back!

717
01:08:22,378 --> 01:08:25,378
 Get back!

718
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:38,393
 -Are you okay, sir?
 -Yes.

719
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:41,394
 -Goddamn it.
 -Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

720
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:49,669
 Help, over here!

721
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:53,039
 Get a medic! Get a medic!

722
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,883
 l think l saw her.

723
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:04,884
 You saw who?

724
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:07,889
 Salt.

725
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:15,028
 The other NATO officer.

726
01:09:16,966 --> 01:09:19,701
 She's here.

727
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:21,036
 Check.

728
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:23,104
 -Clear.
 -Move.

729
01:09:23,105 --> 01:09:24,306
 Go!

730
01:09:24,307 --> 01:09:27,075
 We may have a visual
 on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

731
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:30,076
 Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
 May be dressed as a NATO officer.

732
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:34,180
 This is not a drill.
 The White House is under attack.

733
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:37,851
 Ifyou are near an exit, please
 proceed outside in an orderly manner.

734
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:41,223
 This is not a drill.

735
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:44,224
 l need this hallway cleared
 to the left, now!

736
01:09:44,894 --> 01:09:47,894
 Command, this is Jenks. l need
 the PEOC bunker up and running.

737
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:50,565
 lf this was authorized
 by the Russian government...

738
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:53,566
 ...it is an act of war,
 and we will respond.

739
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:57,403
 Ifyou are near an exit, please
 proceed outside in an orderly manner.

740
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:00,775
 This is not a drill.

741
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:03,776
 -Clear!
 -Let's go, sir.

742
01:10:05,147 --> 01:10:08,147
 Alpha team!

743
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:12,754
 Move, move.

744
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:14,422
 Close it.

745
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:17,423
 Close it.

746
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:25,901
 Please proceed outside
 in an orderly manner.

747
01:10:25,902 --> 01:10:28,902
 This is not a drill.

748
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:02,068
 Go, go.

749
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:05,405
 Geronimo approaching bunker door
 in five seconds.

750
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:12,712
 Clear.

751
01:11:19,088 --> 01:11:20,522
 Any chance she could follow?

752
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:22,757
 My own men couldn't
 get through that door.

753
01:11:22,758 --> 01:11:25,758
 Yeah, well, unfortunately,
 she isn't one of yours.

754
01:11:29,799 --> 01:11:32,467
 Okay, go.

755
01:11:32,468 --> 01:11:35,468
 Stay until it's shut and sealed.

756
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,240
 Geronimo secured.

757
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:11,573
 -Get me Director Medford.
 -Yes, sir.

758
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:14,574
 Sir, l think we need to
 seriously consider the possibility...

759
01:12:14,677 --> 01:12:17,677
 ...that today, right now,
 could be the start of Day X.

760
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,280
 Mr. President,
 Director Medford is up.

761
01:12:22,018 --> 01:12:23,718
 Marion, what's the situation?

762
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:26,719
 It should be coming up
 on one ofyour screens.

763
01:12:27,256 --> 01:12:29,691
 What you see there
 represents temperature drops...

764
01:12:29,692 --> 01:12:32,360
 ...in mobile missile units in Siberia.

765
01:12:32,361 --> 01:12:35,361
 It means the Russians are deploying
 their missiles to the field.

766
01:12:36,032 --> 01:12:39,032
 And that's been confirmed
 on the ground, Mr. President.

767
01:12:40,803 --> 01:12:43,803
 Mr. President, l strongly recommend
 we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

768
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:47,473
 At least at our forward bases.

769
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:50,178
 Do it.

770
01:12:50,179 --> 01:12:53,014
 And since the Russians
 have deployed...

771
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:56,015
 ...we need to look at
 our own nuclear attack options.

772
01:12:56,585 --> 01:12:59,585
 lt's not on the table,
 it's not a deterrent.

773
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:04,090
 Thanks, Marion.
 We'll come back to you.

774
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:26,713
 Sir.

775
01:13:28,284 --> 01:13:31,284
 The outer portal door is jammed.
 No response.

776
01:13:31,554 --> 01:13:34,489
 And we just lost the feed
 from most of our security cameras.

777
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,292
 We're blind down here
 and no one can enter this facility.

778
01:13:37,293 --> 01:13:39,060
 Command, our eyes are down.

779
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:41,863
 We have a PEOC outer security
 door malfunction.

780
01:13:41,864 --> 01:13:43,698
 Get out there now.

781
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:46,699
 Seal this room.

782
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:50,670
 Down that corridor. Secure it.

783
01:14:34,316 --> 01:14:37,185
 Victims are being taken to
 George Washington Hospital.

784
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:40,186
 Reports are coming in that there
 are casualties at the White House.

785
01:14:42,725 --> 01:14:44,626
 This is President Howard Lewis.

786
01:14:44,627 --> 01:14:47,627
 -Proceed with authentication.
 -Yes, Mr. President.

787
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:55,701
 -Ready to commence authentication.
 -Zulu.

788
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:57,138
 -Tango.
 -Echo.

789
01:14:57,139 --> 01:14:58,306
 -Seven.
 -Niner.

790
01:14:58,307 --> 01:14:59,707
 -Juliett.
 -X-ray.

791
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:00,875
 -Sierra.
 -Seven.

792
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,043
 -Alfa.
 -Mike.

793
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:03,878
 -Charlie.
 -Whiskey.

794
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:05,079
 -Five.
 -Six.

795
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,080
 -Tango.
 -Authentication codes confirmed.

796
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:11,319
 It's all yours now, Mr. President.

797
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,320
 God be with you.

798
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:17,390
 Attack options and targeting
 under your control, Mr. President.

799
01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:20,593
 Anders and Nablo,
 what's your location?

800
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:23,663
 Anders and Nablo,
 what's your location?

801
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:27,667
 ls the camera outside
 this door working? Put it up.

802
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:30,770
 Officer Dryer, what's your status?

803
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:33,208
 Officer Dryer, come in.

804
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:35,410
 Federal Communication
 Commission...

805
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:37,912
 ...is activating
 the Emergency Alert System.

806
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,381
 Who the hell's that?

807
01:15:40,382 --> 01:15:43,382
 She's in. Go to DEFCON 1 .

808
01:15:43,385 --> 01:15:45,220
 She's in. Go to DEFCON 1 .

809
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:46,888
 Give me your side arm.

810
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:49,889
 No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
 firearms in the president's vicinity.

811
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:52,493
 Screw protocol.
 We got an enemy agent.

812
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:54,796
 Protocol is protocol, sir.

813
01:15:54,797 --> 01:15:57,797
 And dead is dead.

814
01:15:58,367 --> 01:16:01,367
 Behind me!

815
01:16:01,403 --> 01:16:03,605
 l'm the national security advisor.

816
01:16:03,606 --> 01:16:06,606
 Not anymore.

817
01:16:12,548 --> 01:16:15,548
 Sit down.

818
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:18,519
 Who are you?

819
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,520
 My name, Mr. President,
 is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

820
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:25,560
 And unless you do
 exactly as l say...

821
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:28,561
 ...l will be the last person
 you will ever see.

822
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:36,638
 Shall we look at some
 selective attack options?

823
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:39,639
 Go to hell.

824
01:17:06,435 --> 01:17:09,435
 Selective attack options ready.

825
01:17:09,905 --> 01:17:11,472
 Ted?

826
01:17:11,473 --> 01:17:14,473
 Emergency action message
 released by....

827
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:20,079
 Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
 You made it.

828
01:17:20,616 --> 01:17:23,616
 Why didn't you tell me?

829
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:28,089
 l tried many times, but....

830
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:31,059
 My loneliness was my only friend.

831
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,928
 You weren't with us in Russia.
 l would have remembered you.

832
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:36,364
 l was a class ahead, comrade.

833
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,800
 The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

834
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:41,801
 And now it's my honor
 to launch the attack.

835
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:44,072
 Excuse me.

836
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:47,073
 Selective attack targets acquired.

837
01:17:48,844 --> 01:17:50,678
 Tehran.

838
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:52,880
 Mecca.

839
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:55,881
 Mecca? Tehran?

840
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:57,919
 Part two of our plan.

841
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,588
 Kill nine million people.

842
01:18:00,589 --> 01:18:03,057
 Enrage a billion Muslims.

843
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,193
 America will suffer a painful death.

844
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:08,194
 Permissive action links initiated.

845
01:18:10,632 --> 01:18:13,632
 Missiles arming.

846
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,243
 Nuclear command...

847
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:25,079
 ...posts airborne.

848
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,815
 Let me join you.

849
01:18:27,816 --> 01:18:30,816
 ICBMs set to...

850
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,120
 ...maximum yield.

851
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:38,324
 You know, when you first came
 to Langley...

852
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:41,394
 ...l didn't think l'd be able to do it.

853
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:44,699
 l didn't think l'd be able to...

854
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,700
 ...resist the temptation
 to say something.

855
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,870
 Then you met Mike and...

856
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:53,174
 ...well...

857
01:18:53,175 --> 01:18:56,175
 ...things changed.

858
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,848
 Let me join you.

859
01:19:00,849 --> 01:19:03,849
 All these years right in front of me
 and l never knew.

860
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,195
 Let me join you.

861
01:19:14,196 --> 01:19:17,196
 l want to be with you.

862
01:19:28,944 --> 01:19:31,944
 The man we thought was dead has
 made a resurrection that is miraculous.

863
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:34,348
 President Matveyev is alive.

864
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:36,651
 We're going to Russia.
 What you are seeing...

865
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:39,253
 ...are live pictures of
 Russian president Matveyev...

866
01:19:39,254 --> 01:19:42,254
 ...arriving at the airport outside
 of Moscow. This is astonishing.

867
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:46,325
 According to his doctors,
 President Matveyev's mistaken death...

868
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:49,230
 ...is attributed to
 a temporary paralysis...

869
01:19:49,231 --> 01:19:51,966
 ...from a toxin
 derived from spider venom.

870
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:54,967
 A recap for those who may not have
 been following the events of the day....

871
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:02,341
 At least l was right.

872
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:07,279
 l had a feeling we'd lost you
 back there in North Korea.

873
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:11,083
 l could see how moved you were
 by Mike's little white-knight routine.

874
01:20:11,987 --> 01:20:14,322
 You were supposed to
 recruit him, Ev...

875
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:17,191
 ...not fall in love with him.

876
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:20,192
 That's why l told Orlov
 to pick him up.

877
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,830
 By the way, how is Mike?

878
01:20:26,034 --> 01:20:29,034
 Orlov is dead.

879
01:20:32,608 --> 01:20:35,143
 Well, that's good news.

880
01:20:35,144 --> 01:20:38,144
 Saved me the trouble.

881
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,280
 l had to practically twist his arm to
 get him to blow your cover at the ClA.

882
01:20:44,486 --> 01:20:47,486
 You see, he wanted you
 to come out of this thing alive.

883
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:54,326
 But you needed somebody
 to take the blame.

884
01:20:54,663 --> 01:20:57,663
 l'm the patsy.

885
01:21:00,035 --> 01:21:03,035
 And l'm the hero.

886
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,740
 Congratulations, Ev.

887
01:21:08,744 --> 01:21:11,744
 You're about to become famous.

888
01:21:42,077 --> 01:21:45,077
 Identity confirmation requested.

889
01:21:45,314 --> 01:21:48,314
 Identity confirmation requested.

890
01:22:01,163 --> 01:22:04,163
 Identity confirmation requested.

891
01:22:09,104 --> 01:22:12,104
 Identity confirmed.

892
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:28,721
 Minuteman III ICBMs' batteries
 up to power.

893
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:12,197
 Authorization, 99 percent.

894
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:19,807
 Go!

895
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:22,777
 Permissive action links initiated.

896
01:23:22,778 --> 01:23:25,778
 Trident submarines
 at firing readiness.

897
01:23:27,182 --> 01:23:29,650
 Permission to launch.

898
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:32,651
 Permission to launch.

899
01:23:55,711 --> 01:23:57,845
 Get down on the floor, now!

900
01:23:57,846 --> 01:24:00,846
 l said now!

901
01:24:04,219 --> 01:24:07,219
 Launch sequence aborted.
 Systems restored.

902
01:24:07,356 --> 01:24:09,423
 -Move, move, move!
 -Show me your hands!

903
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:11,359
 -Get down!
 -What is your name, sir?

904
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,360
 l'm Theodore Winter, ClA.
 Help the president.

905
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:19,198
 Mr. President.

906
01:24:19,534 --> 01:24:22,534
 Mr. President, can you hear me?

907
01:24:23,638 --> 01:24:25,239
 -Hold still.
 -EMT's on the way.

908
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,541
 Make sure they got body bags.
 At least seven.

909
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:29,643
 She's wearing a vest.

910
01:24:29,644 --> 01:24:32,413
 l'll meet you in five minutes.
 l wanna get cleaned up.

911
01:24:32,414 --> 01:24:34,181
 And l want her alone in a room.

912
01:24:34,182 --> 01:24:36,851
 lf there are other KAs out there,
 l want her talking.

913
01:24:36,852 --> 01:24:39,852
 She won't talk. She's trained not to,
 no matter what we do to her.

914
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:43,057
 lf we're gonna find these people,
 we gotta do it.

915
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:45,426
 Somebody already did.
 At least some of them.

916
01:24:45,427 --> 01:24:48,427
 Barge on the East River.
 Twelve dead, including Orlov.

917
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:51,730
 Who did that?

918
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,300
 Don't know. Forensics are on it.

919
01:25:01,743 --> 01:25:04,743
 No one comes through until
 the president is secure. Step back.

920
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:07,780
 -l'm Theodore Winter--
 -Step back, sir. Please.

921
01:25:10,886 --> 01:25:13,886
 Well, sir, you're injured. Why don't you
 have a seat? We'll take a look at you.

922
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:18,359
 Are you okay?

923
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,895
 Pretty good gash there.

924
01:25:20,896 --> 01:25:23,896
 Looks like you got a piece of glass
 in there.

925
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,821
 She killed someone else.

926
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:49,822
 It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
 You better get up here.

927
01:25:59,301 --> 01:26:02,002
 Check him. Check him!

928
01:26:02,003 --> 01:26:03,204
 Checking vitals.

929
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:06,205
 l'm not getting a pulse.
 l'm not getting much.

930
01:26:29,164 --> 01:26:32,099
 Sit down.

931
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,802
 She's yours for 1 5 minutes
 during the flight.

932
01:26:34,803 --> 01:26:37,803
 -Give me your hands.
 -Then she's the FBl's.

933
01:27:21,816 --> 01:27:24,418
 Hey.

934
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:26,320
 Why'd you kill him?

935
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:29,321
 Because somebody had to.

936
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:44,269
 What?!

937
01:27:53,415 --> 01:27:56,415
 By this, l take it you think
 everybody is who they say they are.

938
01:27:57,586 --> 01:28:00,321
 You knew something was wrong
 the moment Orlov walked in.

939
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:01,922
 So did l.

940
01:28:01,923 --> 01:28:04,658
 We just didn't know what it was.

941
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:07,659
 -Winter did.
 -Winter?

942
01:28:09,531 --> 01:28:12,531
 You expect me to believe that Winter
 was gonna launch the missiles...

943
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:15,901
 ...and you saved the world?

944
01:28:16,438 --> 01:28:19,438
 l would like you
 to believe that, yeah.

945
01:28:20,942 --> 01:28:23,677
 That's a big accusation.

946
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:26,080
 Well...

947
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:29,081
 ...he's dead now
 so he can't defend himself.

948
01:28:29,084 --> 01:28:32,084
 l guess you'll just have to
 decide for yourself.

949
01:28:39,494 --> 01:28:42,029
 How many more like you are there?

950
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:44,798
 Like me?

951
01:28:44,799 --> 01:28:47,201
 None.

952
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:48,802
 Like him?

953
01:28:48,803 --> 01:28:51,803
 More than you or l can handle alone.

954
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:56,744
 You really think
 a trained Soviet agent...

955
01:28:56,745 --> 01:28:59,745
 ...couldn't kill the Russian president
 at point-blank range if she wanted to?

956
01:29:05,453 --> 01:29:08,422
 Or you, for that matter.

957
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:11,191
 l could've killed you at the funeral
 and l didn't.

958
01:29:11,192 --> 01:29:13,927
 You surrendered to me
 because l gave you no choice.

959
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:16,830
 You know better.

960
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:19,700
 l had a choice.

961
01:29:19,701 --> 01:29:22,701
 You know better.

962
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:43,524
 lf l did believe you...

963
01:29:43,525 --> 01:29:46,525
 ...and l'm not saying for a second
 that l do, but if l did...

964
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:52,230
 ...nobody else would.

965
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:55,567
 Well, maybe you can
 think of a way around that.

966
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:10,115
 They took everything from me.

967
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:14,419
 l'll kill them.

968
01:30:27,268 --> 01:30:30,268
 ETA, four minutes.

969
01:30:36,678 --> 01:30:39,678
 Bullshit!

970
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:53,191
 We are approaching the Potomac,
 heading due south and west.

971
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:02,167
 Go get them.

972
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:24,189
 Salt!

973
01:31:31,004 --> 01:31:33,204
Circle back! Circle back!
