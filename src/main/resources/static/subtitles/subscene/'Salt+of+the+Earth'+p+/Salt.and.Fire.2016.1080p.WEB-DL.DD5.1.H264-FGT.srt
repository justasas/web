1
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:10,622
Please, you must
drink some tea.

2
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,457
Here. Take it off.

3
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:13,892
Here.

4
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,295
Could you move your head forward
please?

5
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,063
A little.

6
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,298
There we go.

7
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,670
Nice meeting you again.

8
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,744
I demand to be set free.

9
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,746
Now... now!

10
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,948
Please drink.

11
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,015
No, thank you.

12
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,584
It may taste strange,
even bitter,

13
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,419
but it will help you adapt
to the altitude.

14
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,853
I do not care.

15
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,089
The tea is brewed
from Coca leaves, that is it.

16
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,458
I want my handcuffs removed.

17
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,194
You have scratched one of
my men and bitten another.

18
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,429
I am proud of that.

19
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:54,266
Well, that is why
you are wearing handcuffs!

20
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,071
Can I take them off now?

21
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,539
Look at me!

22
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,708
Look at me.

23
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,042
Can I take them off now?

24
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,811
Yes, you can!

25
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,285
Please put the cup down.

26
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,020
Put the cup down.

27
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,357
Your hands...

28
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,296
Ah! Ah!

29
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,302
Is that better?

30
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,938
I demand an explanation.

31
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,606
Everything will fall
into place.

32
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,308
When will I get
my passport back?

33
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,242
I'm not sure.

34
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,810
When will I be able to leave?

35
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,846
Of that, too, I am unsure.

36
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,518
I'm hungry.

37
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,988
I haven't eaten
since I was on the plane.

38
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,157
30 hours ago.

39
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,842
Thank you.

40
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,845
Here.
Please, take the tablecloth.

41
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:13,845
Thanks.

42
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,282
Would you like me to get you
something else?

43
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,850
No, I get terribly jet-lagged

44
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,286
when I eat too much
on overnight flights.

45
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,155
Just leave me
the apple juice, please.

46
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,723
- Okay.
- Thank you.

47
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,460
Sweetheart.

48
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,164
Can I have another
glass of champagne, please?

49
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,398
Your fourth?

50
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,069
I like that you keep count
on what's good for me.

51
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,408
And another glass for
my most attractive companion.

52
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,277
Professor sommerfeld.

53
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,448
L-a-u-r-a sommerfeld.

54
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,883
<i> Merci.</i>

55
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,557
Let's celebrate.

56
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,395
Celebrate what?

57
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,734
Can we get another glass
for Dr. meier,

58
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:12,137
who's right there,
across the isle?

59
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,873
We are all on the same...
Journey together.

60
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,943
We need to warm up
for the journey ahead.

61
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,578
Make mine a double bourbon.

62
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,380
Straight, no ice.

63
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:26,752
And, uh, what, if I may ask,

64
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,820
is your joyful party all about?

65
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,789
We are a scientific delegation.

66
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,023
Ah.

67
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,825
She's professor
Laura sommerfeld,

68
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,260
our fearless leader.

69
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,763
We come
with the united nations.

70
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:41,299
To look into
an ecological disaster.

71
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,568
The diablo blanco
disaster.

72
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,570
Diablo blanco?
I hadn't heard of that.

73
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,407
Diablo blanco will soon be
a household name.

74
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,190
Dr. cavani.

75
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,661
Fabio.

76
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,764
You can call me fabio.

77
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,011
Sorry.

78
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,650
Is there anyway
i could change seats?

79
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,954
I am so sorry.
The plane is completely full.

80
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,291
I'm so sorry I can't help.

81
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,047
Professor sommerfeld.

82
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,616
Sleep well.

83
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,720
Call me Laura.

84
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,904
What's the local time?

85
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,939
- I don't know.
- Let me do it for you.

86
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,274
Thank you.

87
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,044
What's our greeter's name?

88
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:06,778
Helmholtz.

89
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:12,317
He's from
the ministry of agriculture
and the environment,

90
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,186
and he's coming
with two people, um...

91
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,290
...which, uh...

92
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,091
Uh...

93
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,060
I can't seem to read this.
It's...

94
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,828
It's my own handwriting. I...

95
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,965
I don't even understand it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

96
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,506
Hm, no. No signal.

97
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,644
Mine's dead, too.

98
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,317
We will ask them to provide us
with local phones.

99
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,385
You know but, my apps
can become very useful.

100
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,653
Such as?

101
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,055
My diary.

102
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,724
April 14th...

103
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,761
Arrivals hall,
immigration line.

104
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,897
The line is, uh...

105
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,865
...lethargic.

106
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,501
It's, uh, listless...

107
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,337
...torpid...

108
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,871
...moribund.

109
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,441
I think I put that quite well,
didn't I?

110
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,675
Right?

111
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,712
And, uh, we're waiting.

112
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,615
And staring.

113
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,250
Staring.
People staring at us.

114
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,586
As if they were competing
for the world championship

115
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,088
of slow looks.

116
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,324
Dr, meier,
why are they staring at us?

117
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:30,462
When I stare back at them,
they don't look away.

118
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,532
where is my luggage?

119
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,567
Mine is not coming out either.

120
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,273
Oh, fuck, I forgot
to pack my toothbrush.

121
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,608
I didn't bring
a toothbrush with me.

122
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,344
<i> Mierda.</i>

123
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,727
<i> No? Bueno.</i>

124
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,128
<i> Gracias.</i>

125
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,030
Let's just go.

126
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,833
Yeah.

127
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,001
It happens.

128
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,207
well...

129
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,911
I'm sure they'll come
any minute now.

130
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,213
Sure thing. Oh, yeah.

131
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,716
Where are they?

132
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,551
You confirmed
our arrival plans, cavani?

133
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,485
Right?

134
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,387
Right-o! Yeah.

135
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,789
I did.

136
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,090
Shall I check at the curb?

137
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,324
No, no, no.
Let's stick together.

138
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,860
Someone will show up
sooner or later.

139
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,607
Hello, hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

140
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,376
It's me. Welcome.

141
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,946
Oh, professor sommerfeld.
Welcome, welcome.

142
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:35,814
Hello!

143
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,216
- Doctor cavani, welcome.
- Yes.

144
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,384
You must be Dr. meier.

145
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,619
Welcome to you, too, sir.
Welcome.

146
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,821
Did you have a good flight?

147
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:43,721
Yeah. Good.

148
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,223
We are just
a little bit jet-lagged.

149
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,125
Of course, I can understand.

150
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,527
Oh, I'm sorry,
i haven't introduced myself.

151
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,029
I am aristides
from the ministry.

152
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,197
Aristides?

153
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,098
Yes. Aristides.
Now...

154
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,533
...the minister
and his group apologize.

155
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,468
There has been
a change of plans.

156
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,704
The minister is already
in oruro,

157
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,807
and he asks that you
take his plane directly there.

158
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,715
"Forgive us, kind gentlemen,

159
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,319
but we are forced to meet you
in oruro later today."

160
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,255
The letterhead
says internal security.

161
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,523
Isn't our liaison

162
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,259
the minister of agriculture
and the environment?

163
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,895
Oh, there's been a mistake.
This shouldn't be here.

164
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,029
A mistake?

165
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,465
Yes. This is a mistake. Uh...

166
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,766
Uh...

167
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,135
I wasn't supposed
to let you know,

168
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,170
but I am obliged to now.

169
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,404
The minister is, in fact,

170
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,974
also associated with
the security establishment.

171
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,410
It shows
his increasing importance
within the government.

172
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,679
But we don't
have our luggage yet.

173
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,514
Oh, don't worry about that.
Don't worry about anything.

174
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,583
My boys will take care
of everything.

175
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,585
In fact, they'll see you
through security.

176
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,654
No inspections, no passports.

177
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,422
I just need your luggage tags

178
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,759
and we'll have your luggage
taken directly to the plane.

179
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,661
Great.
Sounds like a treat.

180
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,064
Okay. Let's go.

181
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,736
I'm afraid
I'll have to leave you here.

182
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,672
- And our luggage?
- It's already loaded.

183
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,273
How did you load it so quickly?

184
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,242
This isn't a German airport
or New York.

185
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,476
We are much more efficient.

186
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,911
It's just my instruments.

187
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,213
I don't care about my shirts,
but my equipment.

188
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,949
Let us worry about all that.

189
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,650
Bon voyage.

190
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,154
Please, come aboard.

191
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,691
I'm kind of hungry.

192
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,629
My apologies.
I ate half.

193
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,032
Thank you.

194
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,670
"For one, too much.
For all, too little."

195
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,905
Sounds familiar.
Who said that?

196
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,274
Alexander the great.

197
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,313
One day his army
was perishing from thirst...

198
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,148
...and a foot soldier came by

199
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,350
with a helmet
filled with water

200
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,120
he had collected drop by drop
for weeks.

201
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,689
He gave it to Alexander,

202
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,657
who spilled it on the floor.

203
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,826
And he had said that.

204
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,129
He said, "for one, too much.

205
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,964
For all, too little."

206
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,401
It's not going to be easy
out there.

207
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,737
As long as I have my equipment
everything will be fine.

208
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,440
As long as we have some
pasta al dente

209
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,375
and some white truffles...

210
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,979
...and a buxom wench
serving wine.

211
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:31,215
And some vineyards
in the mountains...

212
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,085
...and the lusty cheers
of the vintners...

213
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,487
Cavani, you are a poet.

214
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,523
...everything will be fine.

215
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,621
Please come out.

216
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,126
What is this?

217
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,427
Who are these men?

218
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,530
I am not going to get out here.

219
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,300
Where-where is the minister?

220
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:25,703
Please. Please step out.

221
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,170
Ay. No, no, no.

222
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,371
No, no, no, no,
no, no no.

223
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:33,371
What is this?

224
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:37,675
You are under our protection.
We have a security problem.

225
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,743
Who are you?

226
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,545
- I know who I am.
- Who sent you?

227
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:40,545
I'm not gonna tell you.

228
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,848
I am professor sommerfeld
and leader of this delegation.

229
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,750
We are under the protection
of the government.

230
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,852
Yes, yes. And?

231
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,454
And we are under the protection
of the united nations.

232
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,523
I know, I know, I know.

233
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,226
Come outside, please.
We have cars waiting for you.

234
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,761
Hey, and our luggage?

235
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,697
Hey... don't touch me.

236
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,099
I'm not going.
I'll stay here!

237
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,635
I'm not going with you!
Don't touch me!

238
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,537
You are my prisoners!

239
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,039
All of you are my prisoners!

240
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,813
Hold this motherfucker!

241
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,017
Ah! Dr. meier!

242
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,088
Ah! Ay, ay, ay, ay.

243
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,556
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

244
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,024
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

245
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,526
<i> - Vamos!</i>
- Ay!

246
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,062
No!

247
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,933
Dr. meier, don't fight.
They'll hurt you.

248
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,202
Stop fighting back!

249
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,371
We give up!
Stop!

250
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,878
Ah!

251
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,914
Meier? Meier?

252
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,951
<i> Vamos, vamos!</i>

253
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,217
Get him away.

254
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,853
Come on.
Get this motherfucker away.

255
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,217
Don't touch me.

256
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,295
So...

257
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,899
This was all a plan
from the beginning?

258
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,768
In a way, yes.

259
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,738
Why have you abducted us?
What's your plan now?

260
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,007
Everything will fall
into place.

261
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,742
It depends on you.

262
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,545
There is no question
that our embassy

263
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,614
has been alerted
to our disappearance.

264
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,716
They are already
in crisis mode.

265
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:40,050
But it is irrelevant,

266
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,953
because there will be
no negotiations.

267
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,024
And the delegation
who was supposed to meet us
upon arrival?

268
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,392
Have you taken them, too?

269
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,796
No. They were easily bribed.

270
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,697
I take no pride in this.

271
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't approve of pay-offs
to anyone.

272
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,501
Do me one favor!

273
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,937
Do not try to come
to the rescue...

274
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,239
...of a tired world.

275
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,809
I'd like to know your name.

276
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,912
As long as I wear this mask
i have no name.

277
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,681
But I know the face
of this gentleman.

278
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,217
Krauss, why don't you
remove your mask?

279
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,386
You are compromised,
aren't you?

280
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,558
Krauss? You said your name
was aristides.

281
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,761
In fact, if facts count here,
it isn't aristides.

282
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,830
So it is krauss.

283
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,832
Yes, and no.

284
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,035
And how were you able
to get here so quickly?

285
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,637
- We have our ways.
- And who is "we"?
I would like to know.

286
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,006
"We"... that is basically me.

287
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,708
I am the brain.

288
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,611
I am leading a delegation.

289
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:43,080
I am responsible
for its members.

290
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,316
Where are they?
Are they all right?

291
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,284
I can assure you they are fine.

292
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,554
I accept no assurances
from an unidentified man

293
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,356
with no name and no face.

294
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,458
I want to see them, now.

295
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,793
Well, hopefully...

296
00:24:55,795 --> 00:25:00,397
...the time will come when there
are no more secrets between us.

297
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,402
Dr. Arnold meier
and Dr. fabio cavani

298
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,638
are both here at the compound.

299
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,041
How is Dr. meier?

300
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,177
I saw your men hurt him.

301
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,913
He is bruised,
but otherwise subdued.

302
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:16,981
Meaning what?

303
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,316
As Dr. meier
proved to be so combative,

304
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:22,119
we had to calm his heroism
a little bit.

305
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,522
Krauss, why don't you
show professor sommerfeld

306
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,824
the food she should avoid.

307
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,759
Go on, have a look.

308
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,364
Please do not eat these,

309
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:36,567
even if offered
with every indication
of warm hospitality.

310
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,068
You gave this to my delegation?

311
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,504
We did nothing.
Our guests ate it...

312
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:44,108
...and then they came down
with a local form of...
- What's happened to them?

313
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,042
Say it.

314
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,710
Diarrhea.

315
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,778
Krauss...

316
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,582
...why don't you show our guest
to her quarters?

317
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,770
life in a wheelchair
has its comforts,

318
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,238
but not all the time.

319
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,339
I see.

320
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:18,042
It's okay.
One day I shall walk again.

321
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:21,445
Dr. meier, Dr. cavani,
please come to the window.

322
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,749
I... I'm dying.

323
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,017
- No, you're not.
- I'm dying, I'm--

324
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,519
- no, you're not.
- I'm dying.

325
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:28,519
- No, you're not.
- I'm dying!

326
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:31,855
The dumplings, it must have
been the dumplings.

327
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:33,057
Are you hurt?

328
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,125
Yes, but I am going to be fine.

329
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,660
It's just my stomach.

330
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,596
I've got
the dresden of diarrhea.

331
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,632
It's a horde of protozoans

332
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,767
swirling around
my intestinal tract.

333
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,036
I may be dying.
I may be dying.

334
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,571
The noblest place
for a man to die

335
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,740
is the place
he dies the deadest.

336
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,144
This is
the mother of all diarrhea.

337
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,479
Take care.

338
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,648
Keep yourself hydrated
and get some rest.

339
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,316
Professor sommerfeld,

340
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,485
I wish I could help you.

341
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,635
Please abstain from gossiping
in that ugly language.

342
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,637
I'm fine,
i can take care of myself,

343
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,306
of my situation,
of our situation.

344
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,275
Let me try.
- Madame...

345
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,343
...please follow me.

346
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,712
Your quarters
are in the adjacent courtyard.

347
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,786
this way.

348
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,759
Ay, ay...

349
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,895
Ay, ay...

350
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,542
Laura, you look a mess.

351
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,667
Good morning.

352
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,536
Good morning.

353
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,938
Good morning.

354
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,342
Rest assured.
This food is safe to eat.

355
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,911
Thank you, krauss.

356
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,954
Half for you, half for me.

357
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,522
You choose.

358
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,994
Excuse me
for taking your share,

359
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,429
but I'm hungry.

360
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,098
And I'm sure...

361
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,435
...you didn't abduct me
to poison me.

362
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,538
Not at all.
I'm glad to see you eating.

363
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,784
I would like to see Dr. meier
and Dr. cavani.

364
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,919
Be assured...

365
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,589
...they are my respected guests.

366
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,231
Why are you holding me hostage?

367
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,932
Is it for money?

368
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,003
I can contact some officials
to negotiate.

369
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,404
No.

370
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,541
Tell me what you want.

371
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,076
You must be secret service.

372
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:21,245
Are you enjoying the massive
support of the government?

373
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,913
I am no secret service,
no government,

374
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,549
no plot of the CIA,
or anything of the sort.

375
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,317
Who are you, then?

376
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,856
Professor, I expected more
of you.

377
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,994
Matt Riley.

378
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,299
The ceo of the consortium.

379
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,705
The consortium exists
only as a legal entity today.

380
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:51,541
As you may know, after the
ever-opportunistic Swiss

381
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,143
sold their majority stock,

382
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,345
the Chinese,
the Americans,

383
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,247
the south Koreans...

384
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,951
...all ducked into the trenches
and became invisible.

385
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,819
But they're still there.

386
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,824
They are all responsible
for the diablo blanco disaster.

387
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,227
Despite that the disaster
had already begun

388
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:14,298
when I took over as ceo,
i personally feel responsible.

389
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,136
But you must have known
it was not a singular event.

390
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,071
It has evolved over decades.

391
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,173
We have measurements,
data and statistics

392
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:23,974
since the '70s.

393
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,475
Data.

394
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,844
Statistics.

395
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:30,013
I see another side to it.

396
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,616
Public relations.

397
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,685
Don't belittle yourself.

398
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,821
I'm not prepared
to speak about it now.

399
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:40,757
Because you are trying to hide
a big conspiracy, mr Riley?

400
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,093
Ah, I find that silly.

401
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,229
There is no reality...

402
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,433
...there are only views
of reality.

403
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,768
Only perceptions.

404
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,303
All collective anxieties

405
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,540
condense into
conspiracy theories.

406
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,243
My data is real.
There is a disaster.

407
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,046
Yes, and there are
three million Americans

408
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,717
who claim they have had
encounters with aliens.

409
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,186
Among them,
three hundred thousand women

410
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,488
who claim
that they have been abducted

411
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,258
and gang-raped by aliens.

412
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,762
Now this leads me
to two questions.

413
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,630
One...

414
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,801
Why do all these women
weigh over 350 pounds?

415
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:25,969
And, two...

416
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,472
Why have we never heard
of a single abducted woman

417
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,374
in Ethiopia?

418
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,908
Hm?

419
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:39,049
Of course the diablo blanco
disaster exists.

420
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,218
And it is not static.

421
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,652
It is spreading.

422
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:46,823
And my delegation has been sent
to determine at what rate...

423
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,426
...and make our findings public.

424
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,361
What prevents me from doing so

425
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,864
is that you have
taken me prisoner.

426
00:33:53,866 --> 00:34:01,838
I am prepared to accept
the consequences.

427
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,242
Even go to prison
for what I am doing.

428
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,577
I demand to be released!

429
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,579
Don't pressure me!

430
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:13,550
This could end very badly
for both of us.

431
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,086
Do you want to be a martyr?!

432
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:08,171
I'm Laura sommerfeld.

433
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,906
I've been abducted.

434
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,542
I have been in a car...

435
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,645
...at least two or three hours.

436
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,751
I do not know where I am,

437
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,487
<i> but I will play their game</i>

438
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,256
<i> to figure out</i>
<i> what Riley wants.</i>

439
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,769
<i> Hola.</i>

440
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:45,709
Remember now thy creator
in the days of thy youth.

441
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:51,948
This magnificent specimen,
Mr. mcmurphy, speaks.

442
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,184
What did it just say?

443
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,554
"Remember now thy creator
in the days of thy youth."

444
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,791
You know what nostradamus said
about talking birds?

445
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,593
No. I do not read nostradamus.

446
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,195
Hm.

447
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:09,466
He foretold what sounds
like science fiction today.

448
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:14,538
He said, "household pets
finally communicate with man.

449
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,707
Life then possible
outside the planet.

450
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,511
A new tyrant sows terror.
Events to come."

451
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,148
A world run by big data
and predictive analytics

452
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,186
doesn't care
about renaissance predictions.

453
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,889
I want to know
how meier and cavani are.

454
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,025
It's not so much
the predictions themselves

455
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,260
that fascinate me, it's...

456
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:41,031
...where they come from.
Are they true?

457
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,334
Is it possible that there
is something all-pervading
around us

458
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,336
which we
are incapable of seeing,

459
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:49,706
that your data can't analyze...

460
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,109
...which only the prophets
and birds can express?

461
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,483
He has the habit of saying it
at the oddest moments.

462
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:04,554
"Remember now thy creator
in the days of thy youth,

463
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,756
while the evil days come not,

464
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,059
nor the years draw nigh,

465
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,428
when thou shalt say,

466
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,897
I had no pleasure in them."

467
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,933
Ecclesiastes.

468
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,680
<i> You have done research</i>
<i> at the institute</i>

469
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,283
for developmental biology
in tubingen?

470
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,151
I worked with model organisms,

471
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,687
such as the zebra fish,
fruit flies,

472
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,223
and a form of cress
from the cabbage family.

473
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,791
Interesting.

474
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:45,195
It has been shown that genes
which influence development

475
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:47,297
work in a similar way
in different organisms,

476
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:51,101
be they flies, or people,
or cress.

477
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,169
And you are currently
doing research

478
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,405
at the Max planck
institute of biochemistry

479
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:56,706
in Munich.

480
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,709
Technically yes.

481
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:03,079
But here, you are thrown back
into biochemistry.

482
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,751
Sometimes you do step back
in your life.

483
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,153
You don't seem pleased by this.

484
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,856
- Well--
- your life...

485
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,157
...as I have observed it,

486
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,760
seems to be a happy one
for you.

487
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,362
There is someone's future
to care for.

488
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:24,100
What do you know about my life?

489
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,036
Are you not blessed
with a beautiful daughter?

490
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,704
Eight years old?

491
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,580
I'm... I'm sorry.

492
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,949
What a clumsy fool I am.

493
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:43,953
I find your treatment
of my colleagues and me clumsy.

494
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:47,524
Accepted.
But for that,
i shall not apologize.

495
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:50,527
I've given up part of myself,
but not that.

496
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,869
How are meier and cavani?

497
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,476
If you have harmed
meier or cavani,

498
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,446
you will be tried before
an international tribunal

499
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,549
and you will suffer
severe punishment.

500
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,855
Can we finally talk business?

501
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,957
Mr. krauss,
do I see you walking?

502
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,192
Yes, you do.

503
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,693
Is this a miracle?

504
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,364
No, I only use the wheelchair
when I am tired of life.

505
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,631
This is not the way
we should do it.

506
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,434
I propose we finish it now.
The moment of truth.

507
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:34,003
Not the entire truth.

508
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,405
If that moment is to ever come,

509
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:38,208
it will depend
on professor sommerfeld.

510
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,009
And on time.

511
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,780
How much time?

512
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,052
Truth...

513
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,688
...is the only daughter of time.

514
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:09,105
<i> I somehow feel a threat</i>
<i> out there.</i>

515
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:12,308
<i>I'm glad I have the distraction</i>
<i> of my data.</i>

516
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,292
<i> There is something strange</i>

517
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,295
<i> and potentially dangerous</i>
<i> about Riley.</i>

518
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,731
<i> I need to keep him talking.</i>

519
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,385
we have a lot of documentation

520
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:58,154
on the court proceedings
against animals.

521
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,625
Oh yeah, see.

522
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,328
A sow was sentenced to death

523
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,498
for killing and eating
a toddler.

524
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,934
The pig was burnt at the stake.

525
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,102
And here.

526
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,270
The salamander?

527
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:17,207
Oh yeah,
the salamander was...

528
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:19,075
...believed to originate
from fire,

529
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:21,678
being a companion of the devil.

530
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,313
See, here it says,

531
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:27,617
"this salamander was exorcised
with a bucket of holy water.

532
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,185
Then burned."

533
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,758
I think I was meant
to live a different life.

534
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,568
Look in this silver column.

535
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,307
Wow.

536
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,676
I see, it's anamorphic art.

537
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,978
Yes.

538
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,650
And this is
the descent from the cross.

539
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,554
You see,
this is what your situation

540
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,256
must look like to you,

541
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,091
unclear, contorted.

542
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,693
But if you move
one step further,

543
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,495
everything falls into place.

544
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,497
Everything makes sense.

545
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,734
At least, that's what I think.

546
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,537
It's a question of which angle
you choose to look from.

547
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:23,439
This sounds like a banality,
like-like...

548
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,342
Like what?
I am open to criticism.

549
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:29,345
Well, I don't want
to sound insulting,

550
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,548
but it sounds
like a shallow pseudo argument,

551
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,651
like "all africans have rhythm
in their blood."

552
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,087
I bow to you.

553
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:45,461
May I be more precise about
different angles, perspectives?

554
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:46,930
Yes.

555
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:54,671
All my life... I've wanted
to see this in person.

556
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,112
Where is this cloister?

557
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,415
In Rome.

558
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:09,419
In the convent of
the santissima trinità.

559
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,988
Now, just look
along this corridor.

560
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:14,991
Completely normal.

561
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,961
A Saint sitting under a tree.

562
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,496
But...

563
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:24,000
...the nearer one approaches,
the more...

564
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:26,803
...incomprehensible
the forms become.

565
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,872
Until...

566
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,175
Look at this.

567
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,011
The folds in the Saint's cowl

568
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:39,148
become this vast
stretched out landscape.

569
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,084
The folds, in fact,
elongated like this,

570
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,986
become the strait of messina,

571
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,454
which the Saint
wanted to cross,

572
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:47,824
but the boatman
would not take him.

573
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:50,893
So he threw his coat
onto the water...

574
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,996
...and surfed to sicily.

575
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:00,069
Just imagine yourself
walking along this cloister.

576
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,307
<i> I have always dreamed of this.</i>

577
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,684
you know, the truth is

578
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:51,988
I don't really wanna be ceo
of the consortium anymore...

579
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,123
...or anything else,
for that matter.

580
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,927
That's why I live here.
It's a different life.

581
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,432
I'm trying to bring
who I really am into focus.

582
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:03,866
You see?

583
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,651
I would have offered you
these quarters

584
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:23,920
for your comfort,
but I couldn't.

585
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,590
Why is that?

586
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:30,660
Well. A hundred years ago...

587
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:33,863
...the President of the Republic
died in this bed,

588
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:36,699
and it has to be kept this way
for all time.

589
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,005
There are so many
ancient things here.

590
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,978
May I be straightforward?

591
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,820
What do you want from me?

592
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,791
I kind of like you.

593
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,362
Me, as a person?

594
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:07,864
No.

595
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,365
As a woman?

596
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,335
I find you very attractive,

597
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,470
but there is something
beyond that.

598
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,453
I know I act
as if I know everything,

599
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:34,056
but allow me to ask
about your daughter again.

600
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:39,195
My apologies.
If you do not wish to speak,
i fully understand.

601
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,334
I only took this assignment
because of my daughter.

602
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,869
In what sense?

603
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,139
I had to divert my thoughts.

604
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,242
I had to be occupied
by something.

605
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:57,146
I had to have a job
far out in the field.

606
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,048
This makes me curious.

607
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,487
My daughter
has not been with me

608
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,355
for four years now.

609
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,525
Where is she?

610
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,628
She is in Morocco.

611
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,897
- Morocco?
- Yeah.

612
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,935
She's with
her biological father.

613
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,972
But I know that
you've never been married.

614
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,976
Her father took her back
to his country...

615
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,914
...and he refuses to return her.

616
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,951
I have sued ever since,

617
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:38,487
but the Moroccan legal system
is very slow.

618
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,326
I'm sorry to hear that.

619
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:48,231
Having children
invites tragedy.

620
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,235
You have children?

621
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,880
Are you afraid of something?

622
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:05,448
Do I look like it?

623
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,283
No. I apologize.

624
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,587
I used to be afraid
as a little boy.

625
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,558
Children who aren't afraid
scare me.

626
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:21,664
A little boy who isn't afraid
would cease to be a boy.

627
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:22,765
Hmm.

628
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,369
I used to be
afraid of the dark,

629
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:27,870
but my grandmother told me

630
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:30,339
something that stuck with me
ever since.

631
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,774
She said,

632
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,410
"it's okay to be afraid
of the dark,

633
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,946
but the real tragedy in life...

634
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,482
...is when men
are afraid of the light."

635
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,721
Get your bag.

636
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:55,458
- Where are we going?
- Get it now.

637
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,035
I demand to know
where we are going.

638
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,370
Get in the car.

639
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:10,840
No, I'm-I'm not leaving
without my colleagues.

640
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:11,674
Where are they?

641
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,976
Please do not embarrass me.

642
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,445
Tell me what's happened
to Dr. meier and Dr. cavani.

643
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,014
They are safe.

644
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,949
- And me?
- You are not.

645
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,726
I am your prisoner,
but as such, I would like to--

646
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:33,496
as much as you are,
i am a prisoner myself...

647
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,531
...of my plans.

648
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,400
There is no way back now.

649
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,607
Where are we?

650
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,776
Only a short distance
from the very place

651
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:57,446
you traveled ten thousand miles
to see.

652
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,714
Lake diablo blanco.

653
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:04,120
Although these trains
were abandoned here

654
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,754
a hundred years ago...

655
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,591
...time has
propelled them somewhere,

656
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:11,026
maybe even into the future.

657
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,330
Is there such a thing
as science fiction

658
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:16,465
that looks back in time
instead of ahead?

659
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,533
Certainly.

660
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,170
See, these trains,
they never had a purpose.

661
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:23,739
They had nothing to transport,
nowhere to go.

662
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,374
Aliens must have
left them here.

663
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:27,042
Sure thing.

664
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:28,744
Can I take a picture?

665
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,580
Yes, as long as you keep my men
out of the frame.

666
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,949
Please do it quickly,
we have to move on.

667
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:36,652
- But the railroads...
- They are senseless.

668
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,455
They only allow us to go
from where we already are

669
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:41,357
to where we're no better off.

670
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,047
This is uturuncu.

671
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,116
I thought it was important
you see it.

672
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,485
Uturuncu. The dormant volcano?

673
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,255
I know what your
field of study is, professor,

674
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,324
but there is something
much bigger looming

675
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:51,660
than the
diablo blanco disaster.

676
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:54,230
The entire area of uturuncu,

677
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,498
thousands of square miles,

678
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,334
is lifting,

679
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,970
and the volcano itself
is rising and expanding

680
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:04,807
all at a rate that exceeds
any previous measurements.

681
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,209
In fact it is rising so rapidly

682
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,044
that we
are experiencing permanent,

683
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:10,980
round-the-clock tremors.

684
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,848
And what could happen?

685
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,518
You should ask
how fast it could happen.

686
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,622
It might happen
in 200 thousand years,

687
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:22,324
maybe in 20 thousand...

688
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,126
...or maybe in twenty.

689
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,865
There's no point in asking
about nearby population.

690
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,634
When uturuncu erupts,

691
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:35,938
our entire planet
will be obscured for decades.

692
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,307
It won't matter if you live
in the arctic,

693
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,909
or the himalayas, or Australia.

694
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:43,679
We will disappear as a species.

695
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:48,217
I am more concerned about
what we have created here.

696
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,918
Here and now.

697
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,023
A gigantic salt flat
that is expanding rapidly.

698
00:54:54,025 --> 00:54:55,824
So am I.

699
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:02,431
But what may overtake it all
is the fire lying underneath.

700
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,502
We must face both.

701
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,705
Salt and fire.

702
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:16,445
Here lies a monster,
on the verge of waking.

703
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,980
My guess is one day soon

704
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:22,551
everyone will know
how to pronounce uturuncu...

705
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:24,520
Uturuncu.

706
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,383
<i> This is my goal.</i>

707
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,785
To bring you here.

708
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:01,423
But this is exactly where my
colleagues and I were heading.

709
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:03,592
What's the point of all this?

710
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:42,097
<i> I only had an abstract idea</i>
<i> how vast this is.</i>

711
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,432
<i> Just numbers.</i>

712
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:46,368
<i>The alarming thing is the speed</i>
<i> of its expansion.</i>

713
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,771
<i> Almost 800 square miles</i>
<i> per year.</i>

714
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,373
If it continues to grow,

715
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:54,576
the salt will cover
the entire continent one day.

716
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,111
I'm inclined to think
it could cover

717
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:58,080
all land mass on the planet.

718
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,615
Science fiction.

719
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:02,284
I'd love to think that way.

720
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:03,519
Well, you know,
speaking of that,

721
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:06,488
this is the ideal landing site
for aliens.

722
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,459
Nothing on the planet
is so totally flat and so vast.

723
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:12,027
Even our satellites use it

724
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:14,663
to calibrate their distance
from the ground.

725
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,821
- So, this is incahuasi island.
- Put it on the ground.

726
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,189
Put it all down here.

727
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:15,424
I know it from maps.

728
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,862
I thought the world might see
the depth of this place

729
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:21,763
if you experience
something new.

730
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,867
Meaning what?

731
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,803
What are they doing over there?

732
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:31,740
Hey!
- Drive! Go!

733
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:34,376
Stop the car! Hey!

734
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,012
Open the door!

735
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:41,950
No, you can't leave me here!
Stop it!

736
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:43,151
Hey!

737
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,055
There are children there!
Are you mad?!

738
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:51,093
Are you crazy?!
You left children behind!

739
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:53,729
What am I supposed to do
with these kids?!

740
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:08,110
Who are you?
Huh?

741
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,147
Do you know why we are here?

742
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:13,448
Who are you?

743
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,051
Do you know those men?
Riley?

744
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,286
Do you know Riley?

745
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:21,423
Have you been here before?
You know this place?

746
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:22,658
Huh?

747
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,194
Can you see me?

748
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,097
Can you see me?

749
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:32,000
Do you understand me?

750
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:33,702
Can you understand me?

751
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:34,536
Huh?

752
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:38,774
Who are you?

753
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:41,410
I am Laura. Laura.

754
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,546
And you?
What is your name?

755
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:48,050
Laura.

756
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,218
Your name.

757
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,320
Huascar.

758
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:52,788
Huascar.

759
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,289
Huascar?

760
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,692
And the other boy?

761
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:00,162
The other boy?
Is he your brother?

762
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,332
Huh?

763
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:04,800
Laura.
- Laura.

764
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:06,301
And what is your name?

765
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:08,103
Atahuallpa.

766
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,106
Ata-atahuallpa?

767
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,108
Huascar. Laura.

768
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,910
Are you brothers?

769
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,748
Huascar? Atahuallpa?
The royal inca brothers?

770
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:23,819
Have you been here before?

771
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,289
Do you know this island?

772
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,526
Hey.

773
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,663
Do you know this island?

774
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,983
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

775
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,019
That's all the water we have.

776
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:17,939
Come here.

777
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,713
Smell.

778
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:26,481
Onion.

779
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,851
In your language?

780
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,988
Do you like onion?

781
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,895
And now?

782
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,831
What do we do, huh?

783
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:50,572
We have to build a camp.

784
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,664
Let's do this together.

785
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,867
So, please, help me with this.

786
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,170
Unroll it.

787
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:23,638
Good.

788
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,442
And now unfold.

789
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,445
Very good.

790
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:34,883
And... one, two... three.

791
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,384
Very good.

792
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:40,822
give me your hands.

793
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,393
Hold this.
Hold. Okay?

794
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:47,863
Hold still. Good boy.

795
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,466
Good job.

796
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:53,735
Thank you.

797
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:56,404
I need your help, too. Okay?

798
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:57,539
Come with me.

799
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:02,210
Atahuallpa, hold it, please.

800
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,347
Stay here.

801
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,415
Stay here.

802
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,653
Stay here, stay here.

803
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:13,488
Don't move, don't move.

804
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,527
This is good now.

805
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,162
Don't move.

806
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,143
Good job.

807
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,445
Stand still. Good.

808
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,083
Now...

809
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,423
This is our home now.

810
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:30,565
<i> All we have is food</i>
<i> for about a week.</i>

811
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,734
<i> I worry about the water.</i>

812
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:35,837
<i> The salt absorbs</i>
<i> all the humidity.</i>

813
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:40,008
<i> We have blankets,</i>
<i> toilet paper,</i>

814
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:43,678
<i> kitchen utensils,</i>
<i> and a stove.</i>

815
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:01,630
<i> We are trapped here.</i>
<i> In a vast expanse of salt.</i>

816
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:05,033
<i> No fences, no locked doors.</i>

817
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:10,805
<i> Getting away from the island</i>
<i> is impossible.</i>

818
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:12,440
<i> Returning to the shore</i>

819
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:16,544
<i> would mean a three day trek</i>
<i> across salt.</i>

820
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,300
okay. Rice.

821
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:57,519
How do you call it?

822
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,220
Hm?

823
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:01,189
<i> - Sal.</i>
<i> - Sal...</i>

824
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:03,091
Salt.

825
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,360
How about rice...

826
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:09,864
...and some of the dried fish?

827
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:11,132
Hm?

828
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,768
Wow, you did a nice job
with the stove.

829
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:18,840
So...

830
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,627
- Laura.
- Yes?

831
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:41,129
- Laura.
- Hm?

832
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,368
Ah, I'm supposed to hold
my hand like this?

833
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,537
Wow!

834
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,339
Wow!

835
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,241
This is magic!

836
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,743
A magnet.

837
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:57,612
Wonderful.

838
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:34,836
<i> Considering the circumstances,</i>
<i> the night was good.</i>

839
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:38,573
One of the boys
talked in his sleep.

840
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:41,209
Why are we stranded here?

841
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:44,078
Why is Riley doing this to us?

842
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,148
How can we hold out?

843
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,163
Huascar.

844
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,636
Ah, hm.

845
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,605
Is it good?

846
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:11,706
Hmm, yes.

847
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,208
<i> Si.</i>

848
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,342
<i> Ja?</i>

849
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,643
<i> Ja.</i>

850
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,780
Come here.

851
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,624
Like it?

852
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:31,125
Hm?

853
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,163
Atahuallpa.

854
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:37,599
Atahuallpa.

855
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:40,401
Huascar. Huascar.

856
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:41,703
Come here.

857
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,443
It's good. Huh?

858
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:56,818
Like it?

859
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:58,219
Yeah?

860
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,355
Is it good?

861
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,807
We better save the water
for drinking.

862
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:24,479
Come here.

863
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,589
Huascar.

864
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,464
Atahuallpa!

865
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,167
Huascar!

866
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,936
Atahuallpa, you stay here.

867
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:23,571
You stay here, okay?

868
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,343
What are you doing?

869
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:29,644
Hm?

870
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,148
You should hold
your brother's hand.

871
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:40,221
Are you okay?
Give me your hand.

872
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:41,389
Let's go.

873
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,725
Good.
One step to your right.

874
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,393
Big step there.

875
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:00,034
Do you hear anything?

876
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,171
Uturuncu.

877
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:14,081
I can hear something.

878
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,785
Very distant.
Like a faint grumbling.

879
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:22,723
The salt plain
obviously behaves

880
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:25,393
like a gigantic membrane.

881
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:31,866
Are we sitting on a fire
that is moving beneath us?

882
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,164
My wish to have my scientific
instruments with me

883
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,899
is vanishing.

884
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,969
The ocean of salt around me

885
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:11,506
changes my way
of seeing things.

886
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:16,177
I find myself in a maze
of lines I do not comprehend.

887
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:20,147
Just like an alien planet.

888
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,718
<i> This is not of our world.</i>

889
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:49,670
<i> I wish the boys could see</i>
<i> what I see.</i>

890
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:55,743
<i> If I stretched out my hands,</i>
<i> I could harvest the stars.</i>

891
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:03,985
Good.

892
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,423
<i> Uno.</i>

893
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,425
Ooh!

894
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,329
- Laura.
- Laura.

895
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,602
Wow. Six.

896
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:24,005
Oh!

897
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:26,307
Feel. Feel.

898
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:28,209
Six.

899
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,545
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

900
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:33,114
Huascar.

901
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,591
Wow!
<i> - Seis!</i>

902
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:46,093
Feel it.

903
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,633
Burry.

904
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,812
<i> Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.</i>

905
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:09,216
<i> Aqui. Cuatro.</i>

906
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:13,521
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
<i> - Uno, dos, tres...</i>

907
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:15,222
Oh, oh.

908
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:19,727
Atahuallpa.

909
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:23,164
Did you cheat?

910
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:24,832
<i> Ja?</i>

911
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,302
You go back with this, huh?

912
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:33,841
Four.

913
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,079
One, two, three, four.

914
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:40,514
Huascar.

915
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:59,467
Huascar, what did you do?

916
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:00,301
Hm?

917
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,304
<i> - Si, si.</i>
<i> - Ja, ja, ja, ja.</i>

918
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,007
You like cheating, huh?
You like cheating.

919
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:08,476
Si.

920
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,433
Oh.

921
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,935
Congratulations.
- Laura.

922
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,479
Come here.

923
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:47,615
You are two cheaters!

924
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:49,583
You are two cheaters.

925
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,754
I saw that you were
cheating on me.

926
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:55,756
Is that true?

927
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:57,124
Did you cheat on Laura?

928
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:00,761
All the time you were
cheating on Laura, huh?

929
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:03,264
You were cheating on me, you...

930
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,544
Hm?

931
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:44,705
I can't believe
it is already Tuesday.

932
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:47,408
Time makes no sense anymore.

933
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:51,679
Here I am, stranded
with two blind boys.

934
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:13,200
<i> my former life has almost</i>
<i> completely disappeared.</i>

935
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:15,603
<i> I feel that I'm changing.</i>

936
01:21:15,605 --> 01:21:18,505
<i> But how, I do not know.</i>

937
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,546
No...

938
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,854
No.

939
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:29,743
<i> What if nobody</i>
<i> comes to our rescue?</i>

940
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:33,480
<i> What do I tell the boys</i>
<i> when we run out of water?</i>

941
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:40,487
<i> They are totally unaware</i>
<i> of the impending danger.</i>

942
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,961
What are you doing?!

943
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,797
There's such little water left!

944
01:24:29,799 --> 01:24:31,765
Hey!
What did you do, huh?!

945
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,200
Hey!

946
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,771
I'm sorry.

947
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:41,208
Sorry, boys.

948
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,644
I'm sorry.

949
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,505
I hear nothing.

950
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:15,869
Niños!

951
01:26:15,871 --> 01:26:17,204
Here I am!

952
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:19,072
Here I am!

953
01:26:19,074 --> 01:26:20,541
My boys.

954
01:26:20,543 --> 01:26:22,376
Atahuallpa.
<i> - Hola, papa.</i>

955
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:24,411
Huascar. Hey, hey.

956
01:26:24,413 --> 01:26:27,181
- Papa!
- Oh! Oh!

957
01:26:27,183 --> 01:26:29,850
Oh! Oh.

958
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:35,923
Come closer.

959
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:39,560
You are part of the family now,
so to speak.

960
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:42,829
Are you kidding?

961
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:44,998
Are you kidding me?

962
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,344
Good to see you again,
Dr. sommerfeld.

963
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:01,114
Nice to see you again, krauss.

964
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,653
I want an explanation.

965
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,856
Accepted.

966
01:27:09,858 --> 01:27:11,258
And an apology.

967
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,526
I will not apologize.

968
01:27:12,528 --> 01:27:13,860
I deserve an apology.

969
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:17,030
You are with a man
who is accepting
he is going to prison.

970
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:19,700
How are my companions

971
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:22,469
you have so kindly kidnapped
and poisoned?

972
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:24,504
They are in excellent shape...

973
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:27,040
...professor.

974
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:28,875
Thank god.

975
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:32,412
Well, there is one grave
concern with Dr. cavani.

976
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,348
He is grown slightly pale

977
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:36,416
and needs to be sent
to a tanning salon.

978
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:42,389
These boys...

979
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:45,058
...they are my sons.

980
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:47,127
Their mother died

981
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:52,566
shortly after she gave birth
to the younger one, atahuallpa.

982
01:27:52,568 --> 01:27:55,669
She died because of the
toxicity of the environment

983
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:57,638
around the town.

984
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,073
She was a local woman
from colchani.

985
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:03,644
These boys are mine now.

986
01:28:03,646 --> 01:28:06,580
I adopted them
after their mother died.

987
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:12,486
And in three years
they will be completely blind.

988
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:17,057
Blind children have no stake
in any regime.

989
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:24,398
What does it have to do with
my report on diablo blanco?

990
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:29,903
This disaster is man-made.

991
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:33,273
- Of course it is.
- No.

992
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:34,941
Let me speak.

993
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:40,580
You see, I am the ceo
of the consortium,

994
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:43,350
which is responsible
for all of this.

995
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:46,186
The toxins,

996
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:48,155
the desiccation of the lake,

997
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:52,025
the transformation
of a whole landscape...

998
01:28:52,027 --> 01:28:54,194
...into salt.

999
01:28:56,564 --> 01:29:00,300
The failure of a "glorious"
irrigation system

1000
01:29:00,302 --> 01:29:03,203
which diverted
two large rivers.

1001
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:07,574
Both of which
are now beyond repair.

1002
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,945
And the salt here is expanding.

1003
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:17,918
There were fish here...

1004
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:23,190
...a few decades ago.
Boats. Fishermen.

1005
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:25,125
Hard to imagine, isn't it?

1006
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,328
But I was prepared
to report on this.

1007
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:30,897
Why did you take me hostage?

1008
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:33,633
I wanted a report
back to the united nations

1009
01:29:33,635 --> 01:29:36,370
that contained something more
than scientific data,

1010
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:39,406
graphs and lifeless statistics.

1011
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:43,577
A report with
something different in it.

1012
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:50,183
A report of a lake
so poisonous...

1013
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:55,322
...that two boys who grew up
near its shores became blind!

1014
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:02,996
They will never see
a world like this again.

1015
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:26,386
And now, before I turn myself
in to the authorities...

1016
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:30,724
...please allow me two things.

1017
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,566
And this is number one.

1018
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:44,504
Number one.

1019
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:50,777
Laura, can I call you
by your first name?

1020
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,379
Of course.

1021
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:57,818
Please bring me...
Your tablet...

1022
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:00,887
...a toy, and a spoon.

1023
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,424
My tablet...

1024
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:07,227
...a toy, and a spoon?

1025
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:09,429
Yes.

1026
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,164
Okay.

1027
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,534
Okay, Laura,
take a step to the left.

1028
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:16,536
Tiny. Right. Good. Okay.

1029
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:18,839
Hold your arms up.

1030
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:20,707
Okay, now, elbows to hips.

1031
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:22,709
- Like that?
- Right, and your hands flat.

1032
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:24,711
Like this. Okay...

1033
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:29,082
One... two...Three.

1034
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,055
Okay, crouch down.

1035
01:31:35,057 --> 01:31:36,556
Crouch down.

1036
01:31:36,558 --> 01:31:38,358
Okay, now hold still.

1037
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,528
Perfect, perfect.

1038
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,531
Laura, a little bit
to the left.

1039
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:46,700
That's good, okay.

1040
01:31:46,702 --> 01:31:48,935
Put your back foot up!

1041
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:50,637
Ah, that's good.

1042
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:51,872
Okay, scream!

1043
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,814
These photos will
keep me company in prison.

1044
01:32:00,816 --> 01:32:03,116
That's why I wanted them,
you see.

1045
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:09,055
And here is the second thing
i wanted to do.

1046
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:12,259
- It's for me?
- Yes.

1047
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,533
A ticket to Rome?

1048
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:21,234
First class?

1049
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:26,239
Have you forgotten
santissima trinità?

1050
01:32:28,242 --> 01:32:30,577
The Saint under the tree?

1051
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:33,179
Right.

1052
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:45,258
but what if you do not
turn yourself in?

1053
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,298
I'll be caught anyway.

1054
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,436
Then go on the run...
...To Rome.

1055
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:58,772
I guess that's where
I'm going to be.

1056
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:09,883
I don't know what to say.

1057
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:16,623
Why are you standing here?

1058
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:18,925
Book yourself a ticket.

1059
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,431
Guys, guys, I have
a premonition about this.

1060
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:26,967
We have to celebrate
with champagne.

1061
01:33:26,969 --> 01:33:28,234
All that's missing

1062
01:33:28,236 --> 01:33:31,137
are alien astronauts
from a faraway galaxy,

1063
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:32,706
traveling for centuries

1064
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:34,608
through the eternal darkness
of space.

1065
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,776
They see
this white heaven below,

1066
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:38,511
and they descended
their space craft

1067
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:41,615
with flickering lights
in a cloud of salt.

1068
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:42,949
Wonderful.

1069
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:45,418
But how do we attract them?

1070
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,154
We need some kind
of satellite transmission.

1071
01:33:48,156 --> 01:33:49,623
Nonsense.

1072
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:51,825
The champagne will be the bait.
