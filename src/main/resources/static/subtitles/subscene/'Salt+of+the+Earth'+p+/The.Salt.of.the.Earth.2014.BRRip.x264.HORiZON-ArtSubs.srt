Maybe it was dead.

661
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,332
But the man was
holding on and on...

662
00:53:30,431 --> 00:53:33,452
Yet when he reached the
doctors, his child was dead.

663
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:37,428
After such a long march.

664
00:53:45,997 --> 00:53:49,176
Doctors Without Borders
had to give up this camp.

665
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,656
Water is essential
in these camps...

666
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:54,585
and it had
become a huge problem.

667
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,860
So they had to move the camp
as fast as possible.

668
00:54:02,203 --> 00:54:06,566

crammed into UN trucks...

669

fertile piece of land...

water by the Nile,

677

the people died...

00:54:44,938 --> 00:54:46,212

679
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:48,808
There was nothing to eat.

680
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,764
They were in the final stages
of their distress.

681
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:59,832
They'd forgotten to bring
food, or hadn't been able to.

682
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:02,802

had gone wrong.

683

held on so long...

684
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:08,084

they could no more.

685
00:55:19,952 --> 00:55:21,665
I went to Mali.

686

01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:58,388
150 kilometers
of dead bodies...

859
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:10,472
I turned back, because my
story was about people.

860
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:14,742
I was doing my book on refugees,
I was working on Exodus-

861
01:07:14,858 --> 01:07:17,564
I started going
into the camps...

862
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:19,294
and I began to see...

863
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:23,151
the sheer number of people
leaving Rwanda.

864
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:28,197
Hell was taking
the place of paradise.

865
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,724
It was frightening...

866
01:07:31,825 --> 01:07:35,432
to see, on such
a beautiful savanna...

867
01:07:35,546 --> 01:07:38,646
this mega city springing up.

868
01:07:41,108 --> 01:07:44,636
Within days, there were
almost a million people here.

869
01:07:51,872 --> 01:07:55,884
Among all this distress, one
thing that really moved me...

870
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:59,404
was the relationship between
this mother and her child...

871
01:07:59,514 --> 01:08:03,166
and the child's
trust in its mother.

872
01:08:16,601 --> 01:08:18,190
Violence...

873
01:08:18,882 --> 01:08:20,550
and brutality...

874
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:24,013
are not the monopoly...

875
01:08:24,124 --> 01:08:26,153
of remote countries.

876
01:08:26,245 --> 01:08:29,458
It happened right here, in
Europe, in ex-Yugoslavia.

877
01:08:29,566 --> 01:08:31,708
It was very shocking.

878
01:08:34,248 --> 01:08:38,216
A bus coming from Krajina
through Croatia...

879
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:41,873
a person was killed
through that hole.

880
01:08:41,971 --> 01:08:45,939
<i>The Croats killed lots of people
too as they left Krajina.</i>

881
01:08:46,733 --> 01:08:48,525
Violence was everywhere.

882
01:08:48,613 --> 01:08:52,028
But what disgusted me most...

883
01:08:52,134 --> 01:08:55,945
was to see how
contagious hatred was.

884
01:08:56,776 --> 01:08:59,594
These people too saw violence.

885
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:01,016
Entire families...

886
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:04,553
the whole Serbian population
of Krajina was expelled.

887
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,163
And overnight,
they found themselves...

888
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:14,308
evicted from their homes,
looking for a place to go...

889
01:09:14,423 --> 01:09:17,951
having their next-door
neighbors shooting at them.

890
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,693
These were refugee camps
not far from Tuzla...

891
01:09:37,391 --> 01:09:40,412
in central Bosnia.

892
01:09:40,513 --> 01:09:43,567
These families had left
the enclave of Zepa...

893
01:09:43,673 --> 01:09:47,607
where Serbs murdered
thousands of young men.

894
01:09:48,636 --> 01:09:50,428
We were there at
the very moment

895
01:09:50,516 --> 01:09:53,334
when the families
were arriving...

896
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:57,025
in a state of great distress.

897
01:10:08,363 --> 01:10:11,068
There were only women,
old men...

898
01:10:12,044 --> 01:10:13,273
and children.

899
01:10:13,405 --> 01:10:17,496
The younger men had all
been held and murdered.

900
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,990
It was strange that this
was happening in Europe...

901
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:30,072
at the end of
the 20th century.

902
01:10:30,611 --> 01:10:32,122
From the cars alone...

903
01:10:32,212 --> 01:10:36,146
you can see these people
had a standard of living...

904
01:10:36,253 --> 01:10:38,519
a European
standard of living...

905
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:41,478
a European
intellectual level...

906
01:10:41,576 --> 01:10:43,875
a European infrastructure.

907
01:10:43,976 --> 01:10:45,848
And they lost everything.

908
01:10:49,939 --> 01:10:53,794
Hundreds of kilometers,
crowded with people and cars.

909
01:10:58,101 --> 01:10:59,849
We are a ferocious animal.

910
01:10:59,942 --> 01:11:02,760
We humans are
terrible animals.

911
01:11:04,304 --> 01:11:08,035
Here in Europe, in Africa, in
South America, everywhere...

912
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:10,812
we are extremely violent.

913
01:11:17,749 --> 01:11:19,936
Our history is
a history of wars.

914
01:11:27,152 --> 01:11:28,741
It's an endless story...

915
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:30,941
a story of repression...

916
01:11:31,034 --> 01:11:32,702
a tale of madness.

917
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:44,541
The situation in
Rwanda kept changing.

918
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:48,731
The Hutu army, which was ruling
the country, was defeated...

919
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,799
and retreated into the Congo,
to the Goma region.

920
01:11:55,243 --> 01:11:59,763
First, the Tutsis had fled
the Hutu barbarity.

921
01:11:59,924 --> 01:12:01,830
And then, the Hutus...

922
01:12:01,925 --> 01:12:04,472
fled the Tutsi occupation.

923
01:12:04,566 --> 01:12:06,674
So everybody fled, in turn.

924
01:12:09,888 --> 01:12:11,760
In just a few days...

925
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:14,825
in July 1994...

926
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,283
the Goma region...

927
01:12:16,371 --> 01:12:19,347
received more than
2 million people.

928
01:12:20,972 --> 01:12:23,554
It was a disaster
in the making.

929
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:29,472
Diseases such as cholera
started spreading...

930
01:12:29,576 --> 01:12:33,747
and the people
began to die like ants.

931
01:12:33,857 --> 01:12:36,877
12 to 15 thousand
died every day.

932
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,963
I was taking photos
of these piles of corpses...

933
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:47,558
when I saw the dad
coming with his kid.

934
01:12:47,662 --> 01:12:49,173
He threw him on the pile...

935
01:12:49,263 --> 01:12:53,591
and left with his friend, chatting
as if nothing had happened.

936
01:13:00,307 --> 01:13:03,440
They couldn't
bury all the people.

937
01:13:04,469 --> 01:13:07,523
So a bulldozer came
from the French army...

938
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:11,518
which took dozens at a time...

939
01:13:11,631 --> 01:13:13,694
laid them out on the ground...

940
01:13:13,792 --> 01:13:16,498
and covered them with earth.

941
01:13:33,879 --> 01:13:36,663
Everybody should
see these images...

942
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,657
to see how
terrible our species is.

943
01:13:46,324 --> 01:13:49,615
Orphan kids,
who were on the road.

944
01:13:51,606 --> 01:13:53,037
Three children...

945
01:13:53,166 --> 01:13:56,740
the two with the livelier eyes
would live.

946
01:13:56,848 --> 01:14:00,816
The one whose eyes
are clouded was dying.

947
01:14:03,531 --> 01:14:06,507
When I got out of there,
I was ill...

948
01:14:06,612 --> 01:14:09,159
my body was very sick.

949
01:14:09,252 --> 01:14:12,939
I didn't have any
infectious diseases...

950
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:15,003
but my soul was sick.

951
01:14:19,897 --> 01:14:23,944
I went back to Rwanda
one year after the disaster...

952
01:14:24,058 --> 01:14:29,254
to cover the return of the Hutus
who'd been in the Congo...

953
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,975
and had nowhere to go.

954
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:35,547
The United Nations started
forcing them to return.

955
01:14:46,587 --> 01:14:50,712
You felt the whole planet was
covered with refugee tents.

956
01:15:03,953 --> 01:15:06,015
After working there...

957
01:15:06,113 --> 01:15:10,679
the Tutsi authorities
suggested that I should see...

958
01:15:10,796 --> 01:15:14,684
a few of the places where
the massacres had occurred.

959
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:26,275
People had fled to a church,
believing they'd be safe.

960
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:29,500
All murdered!

961
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:38,622
Here, it happened in a school.

962
01:15:38,806 --> 01:15:43,529
You can still see what was written
on the blackboard that day.

963
01:15:43,688 --> 01:15:45,717
It was terrifying.

964
01:15:59,694 --> 01:16:03,899
The people who had left Rwanda,
about 2 million refugees...

965
01:16:04,015 --> 01:16:06,675
some went back to Rwanda...

966
01:16:06,776 --> 01:16:09,482
but others were
afraid of the repression.

967
01:16:09,577 --> 01:16:14,660
So a column of about 250,000
people left the city of Goma...

968
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:17,045
and entered the Congo forest.

969
01:16:20,181 --> 01:16:21,455
We lost track of them.

970
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:25,510
Everybody knew there were
250,000 lost people.

971
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,569
Nobody knew where they were.

972
01:16:30,225 --> 01:16:32,175
Six months later...

973
01:16:32,746 --> 01:16:37,345
they started appearing near Kisangani,
in the center of the Congo.

974
01:16:39,789 --> 01:16:43,441
They'd lived in
the forest for 6 months.

975
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:49,708
So the UN took me there.

976
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:54,087
There was a train
and I took it.

977
01:16:55,274 --> 01:16:58,611
It was dropping off food,
then heading back.

978
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,620
But I said, "I'm staying."

979
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:02,588
(BRAKE SQUEALING,
STEAM HISSING)

980
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:11,272
I spent three days with these
people, who kept arriving.

981
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,988
Columns and columns of them...

982
01:17:16,482 --> 01:17:19,853
To think that when they left
they were 250,000...

983
01:17:19,964 --> 01:17:22,985
and only 40,000 made it here!

984
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:26,771
210,000 people were missing!

985
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:39,557
Yet at the same time,
life went on.

986
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:43,822
A guy cutting hair...

987
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:47,550
Or even this Congolese guy...

988
01:17:47,694 --> 01:17:49,486
with his calculator...

989
01:17:50,495 --> 01:17:53,549
who was trying to collect...

990
01:17:53,696 --> 01:17:57,664
the few dollars he was
sure people had on them...

991
01:17:57,778 --> 01:18:01,543
which he was trying to exchange,
in the middle of nowhere!

992
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:04,680
In the middle of
a remote forest.

993
01:18:11,862 --> 01:18:13,013
At that time...

994
01:18:13,703 --> 01:18:18,223
the pro-Tutsi guerilla movement
that had seized Kisangani...

995
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:21,005
began to expel
these people again...

996
01:18:21,106 --> 01:18:22,617
to send them back.

997
01:18:22,707 --> 01:18:27,115
Six months to get there,
and now back to Rwanda!

998
01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:29,416
They began to
kill some of them.

999
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:34,714
There, I met people who just
couldn't take any more.

1000
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:38,416
Who started to be delirious...

1001
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:40,503
losing their minds...

1002
01:18:40,593 --> 01:18:42,104
They were driven mad.

1003
01:18:47,436 --> 01:18:51,044
In fact, those people
who were expelled...

1004
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:53,583
were never heard from again.

1005
01:18:54,959 --> 01:18:57,416
I believe they
were all murdered.

1006
01:19:05,203 --> 01:19:10,523
That was my last trip, that
disastrous time in Rwanda.

1007
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,149
When I left there...

1008
01:19:17,808 --> 01:19:19,916
l no longer
believed in anything,

1009
01:19:20,008 --> 01:19:22,590
in any salvation
for the human species.

1010
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:25,395
You couldn't
survive such a thing.

1011
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:27,282
We didn't deserve to live.

1012
01:19:27,411 --> 01:19:29,316
No one deserved to live.

1013
01:19:39,536 --> 01:19:44,451
How many times did I lay my cameras
down to cry over what I'd seen?

1014
01:19:50,859 --> 01:19:54,467
<i>WENDERS: Sebastião had seen
into the heart of darkness</i>

1015
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:58,996
<i>and deeply questioned his work
as a social photographer</i>

1016
01:19:59,102 --> 01:20:01,729
<i>and a witness of
the human condition.</i>

1017
01:20:02,544 --> 01:20:05,994
<i>What was left for
him to do after Rwanda?</i>

1018
01:20:13,949 --> 01:20:17,838
<i>JULIANO: In that time, my
grandfather's health had worsened.</i>

1019
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:23,045
<i>My parents had to return to
Brazil to take care of the farm.</i>

1020
01:20:23,872 --> 01:20:26,454
<i>It was nothing
but a wasteland.</i>

1021
01:20:26,553 --> 01:20:29,056
<i>They didn't know
what to do with it.</i>

1022
01:20:29,715 --> 01:20:33,999
<i>The birds, the alligators and
the majestic forests were gone.</i>

1023
01:20:34,116 --> 01:20:38,128
<i>There was nothing left from
Sebastião's childhood memories.</i>

1024
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:45,374
<i>And then Lélia came up
with a surprising idea.</i>

1025
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,769
<i>"Why don't we replant the
forest that was here before?"</i>

1026
01:20:52,242 --> 01:20:54,114
<i>WENDERS: The forest
that was there before</i>

1027
01:20:54,203 --> 01:20:56,987
<i>and had once spread
over all these hills</i>

1028
01:20:57,084 --> 01:21:00,895
<i>was Mata Atlantica,
the Atlantic rain forest.</i>

1029
01:21:02,126 --> 01:21:04,708
<i>Nobody had ever
tried to replant it,</i>

1030

01:33:02,434 --> 01:33:05,805
They respect each other.

1199
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:10,594
And when you visit them,
you have to be polite...

1200
01:33:10,758 --> 01:33:13,340
to stand in a certain way...

1201
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:16,223

respect their territory.

1202
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,699
And then you're welcomed.

1203
01:33:20,402 --> 01:33:23,896
I also befriended a whale.

1204
01:33:28,005 --> 01:33:30,271
These are whales...

1205
01:33:31,886 --> 01:33:33,238
in Argentina.

1206
01:33:35,887 --> 01:33:39,461
An adult like this is 35 meters
long, weighs about 40 tons.

1207
01:33:40,689 --> 01:33:43,034
She came so
close to the boat...

1208
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:45,312
I could touch her.

1209
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:48,116
And it was incredible.
Such sensitive skin!

1210
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:49,801
As I was caressing her...

1211
01:33:49,892 --> 01:33:54,300
I could see her tail, 35
meters away, trembling.

1212
01:33:54,414 --> 01:33:56,003
Incredible sensitivity.

1213
01:33:56,655 --> 01:34:00,939
We had a small boat,
just 7 meters long.

1214
01:34:01,497 --> 01:34:04,203
She knew she
could have sunk us.

1215
01:34:04,298 --> 01:34:07,116
But she never once
hit the boat. Not once!

1216
01:34:07,219 --> 01:34:10,319
As we left,
she began tapping her tail...

1217
01:34:54,196 --> 01:34:56,496
That's like another planet!

1218
01:34:56,597 --> 01:34:58,896
It's quite incredible.

1219
01:34:58,998 --> 01:35:03,643
Let me see if I have another
photo of the Nenets.

1220
01:35:04,961 --> 01:35:08,849
See, everything
a Nenet owns is here.

1221
01:35:10,323 --> 01:35:11,641
That's their house.

1222
01:35:16,205 --> 01:35:19,891
I'd been planning this work
on the Nenets for a long time.

1223
01:35:20,966 --> 01:35:25,171
About eighteen people,
with six thousand reindeer...

constantly migrating.

1225
01:35:29,649 --> 01:35:32,704
This must be about
seven in the evening.

1226
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:35,911
At about eight in the evening
they'd light a fire...

1227
01:35:36,012 --> 01:35:38,751
and cook the only
hot meal of the day.

1228
01:35:39,694 --> 01:35:43,109
After the meal, we'd chat a bit.
Everybody talked.

1229
01:35:43,215 --> 01:35:44,726
They'd put out the fire.

1230
01:35:44,816 --> 01:35:50,767
While the fire was burning, it was
15 to 20 degrees, quite nice.

1231
01:35:50,938 --> 01:35:53,440
Two hours later,
it was minus thirty.

1232
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:00,070
They're the real
cowboys of Siberia.

1233
01:36:00,181 --> 01:36:02,887
They always
have their lasso...

1234
01:36:02,982 --> 01:36:06,082
made of reindeer skin,
around their necks.

1235
01:36:07,023 --> 01:36:11,826
They have boots made
of silver-fox skin.

1236
01:36:12,705 --> 01:36:16,155
They sleep with them.
Those boots last a lifetime.

1237

1239
01:36:37,715 --> 01:36:41,322
At this spot, it's about
47 kilometers wide.

1240
01:36:44,398 --> 01:36:48,489
Once past the Ob,
you're in the Arctic Circle.
