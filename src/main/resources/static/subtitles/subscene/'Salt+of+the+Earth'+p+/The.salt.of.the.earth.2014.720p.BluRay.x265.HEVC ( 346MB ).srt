2
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:08,810
It may be best to start recalling the origin of this word.

3
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,103
In Greek, "photo" meaning light.

4
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:15,233
And "graphein" was writing, drawing.

5
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:19,695
A photographer is literally someone drawing with light.

6
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:24,742
Someone who writes and rewrites the world with light and shadow.

7
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:47,391
Sierra Pelada, la pray Mine Brazil,

8
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:49,061
in front of me.

9
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,858
When I reached the edge of that huge hole

10
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:58,194
I raised the hair.

11
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,489
I had never seen anything like it.

12
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:07,996
There, I saw before me in a split second,

13
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:09,997
the history of mankind.

14
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,002
The history of the construction of the pyramids,

15
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,169
the Tower of Babel,

16
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:17,174
King Solomon's Mines.

17
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:21,637
The sound of a single machine in there was no sound.

18
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,389
Only you could hear

19
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:30,104
the murmur of 50,000 people in a big hole.

20
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,900
Conversations, noise, human noise

21
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:37,944
mixed with touches manuals ...

22
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,949
Actually, I have traveled to the beginning of time there.

23
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:47,706
I could almost hear the murmur of gold in those souls.

24
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,930
We had to throw all that land.

25
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:05,724
Not everything is gold,

26
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,937
They had to climb, get out, climb the small stairs

27
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:12,274
then get to the big stairs,

28
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,026
and come to the surface.

29
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,997
You're not thinking of falling.

30
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,382
And if you fall, there is a risk you take several.

31
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:40,179
I up several times a day

32
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:42,639
and it never occurred to me that I might fall

33
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,099
because no one fell.

34
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,896
We were there to carry bags or to take pictures, in my case.

35
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,990
The men went up there 50 or 60 times a day.

36
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:06,707
The only way down an inclined plane like that

37
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,332
He is running.

38
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:11,252
Si paras, te caes.

39
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:24,891
All these people together formed a very organized world.

40
00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:27,396
But completely crazy.

41
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:44,122
They may look like slaves,

42
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,665
but there was not a single slave.

43
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:50,920
If there was slavery there, it was the desire to be rich.

44
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:53,590
Everyone wanted to be rich.

45
00:04:55,552 --> 00:05:00,930
There you could find everything: intellectuals, lawyers,

46
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:03,975
Farm employees,

47
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,560
City workers ...

48
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,108
They all came to look for an opportunity.

49
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,281
Because when we gave a gold mine,

50
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:21,495
everyone working in that part of the mine

51
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:24,622
They had the right to choose a bag.

52
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:28,084
And in those sacks they had chosen

53
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:30,129
slavery was hiding.

54
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:34,341
It could be nothing or could be a kilo of gold.

55
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,637
At that time they played their independence.

56
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:44,437
All men, when they begin to touch the gold,

57
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,189
They do not return.

58
00:05:56,865 --> 00:06:00,202
I saw this picture for the first time in a gallery,

59
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,538
more than twenty years ago.

60
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,872
I did not know who had taken.

61
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:10,629
I thought, "He must be a great photographer and an adventurer."

62
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:13,882
Behind it was a stamp and a signature.

63
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:16,343
Sebastiao Salgado.

64
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,889
I bought a copy.

65
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,978
The gallery drawer pulled more photos of the same photographer.

66
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,106
What I saw moved me deeply,

67
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,692
especially this image,

68
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:34,281
portrait of a blind woman Tuareg.

69
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:39,577
Even though tears cause I see every day,

70
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:42,874
So since then, it hangs on my desk.

71
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:47,754
I knew something of Sebastiao Salgado.

72
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,255
Really they cared about people.

73
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:53,050
This meant a lot to me.

74
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:57,555
At the end of the day, people are the salt of the earth.

75
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:02,894
It was a long time before we met

76
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:07,524
and we talked about his life, his work and where it came from everything.

77
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:18,451
The salt of the earth

78
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:46,983
We can put many photographers in one place,

79
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,985
always will draw very different pictures

80
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,156
because necessarily come

81
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:59,038
very very different sites.

82
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:02,708
Everyone has their way of seeing,

83
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:07,045
each according to his story.

84
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,175
I think my story

85
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,223
It is that I learned my way to see here in this place.

86
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:19,891
Here I have an ideal world.

87
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,773
Took long walks with my father,

88
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:28,901
through this place, and we came here to watch.

89
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:35,158
Behind each of these mountains,

90
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:38,370
there is a story, there is something to see.

91
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:48,506
Here I dreamed a lot.

92
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:53,386
He wanted to go beyond these mountains, he wanted to know.

93
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:06,775
A JOURNEY WITH Sebastiao Salgado

94
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:45,942
MOUNTAINS OF WEST PAPUA, INDONESIA, Village Yali, 2011

95
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:25,384
Sebastiao was very bohemian, was always traveling.

96
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:27,899
He liked to travel as anyone.

97
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,181
My father was like that.

98
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:34,437
It was not anywhere. It was like a shuttle.

99
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,147
That was Tiao.

100
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:39,900
I thought I was in Vitoria, and was here.

101
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:44,528
O he was in the north, or making political propaganda.

102
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:46,282
And as for studies,

103
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:49,616
if I had not had friends, he would have studied.

104
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:56,417
Sebastiao was left for studies. He gave a lot of work.

105
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,586
But he studied economics.

106
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,466
I wanted to do law.

107
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,509
He studied one year, but did not like

108
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:09,264
and he switched to economics, and did well.

109
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,061
This was Sebastiao Salgado,

110
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,355
Father.

111
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,609
He bequeathed his name to his only son,

112
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:23,821
who, though he remained all his life a restless traveler,

113
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,118
He benefited from studies that his father forced him to take

114
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,121
in ways that would never have imagined.

115
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:37,336
His studies in Economics endowed him sound knowledge

116
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,755
markets, trade and industry.

117
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:43,841
So I knew what ruled the world.

118
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:50,518
For him, all started in Aimorés, a small town in Brazil.

119
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:54,812
There the estate of his father stood under the big sky.

120
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,649
There were vast Atlantic forests.

121
00:14:57,774 --> 00:15:01,070
The river then was still navigable.

122
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,283
But above all, endless trains were passing by

123
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:08,913
bursting with minerals, iron ore

124
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,748
going from there to the rest of the world.

125
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:17,044
At the end of the day, this was and still is the largest mining area in the world.

126
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:23,092
That's where Sebastiao grew. He was the only child among seven sisters.

127
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:24,553
What a life!

128
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:27,264
Every summer,

129
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,101
He played on the banks of the Rio Doce, the "sweet river".

130
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,313
That's where we are.

131
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,773
So here we are,

132
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,234
our small crew.

133
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:39,985
Sebastian, ?te ahí falls?

134
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,197
I learned one thing.

135
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:45,658
Having a photographer in front of my camera

136
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:48,745
It is very different from shooting anyone else.

137
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:52,498
Not standing still doing himself.

138
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,713
No. For professional bias, react and respond

139
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,966
using his weapon, his camera.

140
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,302
Returns the shot.

141
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:07,557
- Wim, I have a very nice picture of you. - I will not say it.

142
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:09,057
I can imagine!

143
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:12,395
In this case, it was not just me ... fotografiándome

144
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:13,355
Look at the picture.

145
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,234
Two of us had on target.

146
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:20,028
The other, my fellow director, was his eldest son, Julian.

147
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:25,033
He had already accompanied his father with his camera on several trips,

148
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:29,081
as Papua New Guinea, who have already seen.

149
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:34,503
Or here, to a remote island north of the East Siberian Sea.

150
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,129
I wish I could join them.

151
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,645
Father and son Salgado invited me to continue this documentary with them,

152
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:54,399
I guess to add an external view of your adventure.

153
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:57,360
I did not hesitate for a second.

154
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,945
What more could you ask for?

155
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:03,573
At last I could get to know this man,

156
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,994
discover what motivated him

157
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:09,873
and why his work had impressed me so much.

158
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:15,046
I did not know I was going to discover

159
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:17,298
much more than a photographer.

160
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:24,056
Sebastiao was 15

161
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:27,684
when he took the train and went to the small town forever

162
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,313
to attend school in the provincial capital of Vitoria.

163
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:36,151
So young, at first did not know what to do with money in their pockets.

164
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:39,153
I had never paid any money.

165
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,990
On the farm, which produced all of them.

166
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:44,951
So, at first, starved,

167
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:48,455
dreading going to a store to order something to eat.

168
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:55,212
Ignorant of what had become of Sebastiao

169
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:58,674
He had not appeared this girl in your life.

170
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:00,051
Lelia.

171
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:04,181
I was 17, I was studying music and incredibly beautiful.

172
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:06,432
It was love at first sight.

173
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:08,434
When Sebastiao won a scholarship

174
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,814
to study for a Master in Economics from the University of Sao Paulo

175
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:14,484
they moved there and married.

176
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,529
It was the 60,

177
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:21,282
both they involved in left-wing movements,

178
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:25,161
as other students in Paris, Berlin or Chicago.

179
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:29,125
Brazil was under the rule of a brutal military dictatorship,

180
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,586
thus, the risk of being arrested, deported and tortured was constant.

181
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:38,092
In August 1969,

182
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:41,262
Sebastian y su Lelia if marcharon of homeland

183
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:43,431
and they took a boat to France.

184
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:48,478
Sebastiao while continuing his training as an economist,

185
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:51,147
Lélia studying architecture.

186
00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:55,027
A memorable day, she bought a camera for their work.

187
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:58,489
And we really had fun with her was Sebastiao.

188
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:02,521
The first photograph was taken Lélia, of course.

189
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:07,789
Sebastiao entered the International Coffee Organization

190
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:09,250
and they moved to London.

191
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,795
With the idea of ??a career in the World Bank,

192
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:16,258
often he traveled to Africa to study development projects.

193
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:18,301
Lélia's camera was taking

194
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,096
and always he returned with many pictures.

195
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:25,684
Realizing that those pictures

196
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:29,563
They met him much more than economic reports,

197
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:32,942
both took a bold decision.

198
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:35,153
He had to take the enormous risk

199
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:40,157
to abandon his promising career as an economist

200
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:42,327
to start from scratch.

201
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:47,915
They returned to Paris and spent all photographic equipment cost.

202
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,628
For a time, Sebastiao tried photographing sports,

203
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:56,050
made portraits, weddings and even naked,

204
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:58,677
before finding his calling.

205
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:05,769
Those are my first photos.

206
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,980
We were in Tahoua.

207
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,358
Two young mothers queuing

208
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:15,779
to receive food.

209
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:21,035
It was a time of great drought in Niger, 1973.

210
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:26,164
For Lelia was more difficult because she was pregnant.

211
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,669
I remember once we were there,

212
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:33,923
in a friend's house in Niamey.

213
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:36,968
Then came the marabout of Niamey.

214
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:41,472
Lélia was wearing shorts, she was gorgeous.

215
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:45,727
And the marabout came, sat down,

216
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:47,813
and said Lelia.

217
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,316
"Come out, sit on my lap."

218
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:53,278
"Oh," I said,

219
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:57,365
"Marabout sir, there is a small problem,

220
00:20:57,492 --> 00:21:01,201
this woman is pregnant

221
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,538
our first child.

222
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:06,833
You better stay here. "

223
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:10,837
He understood the need ...

224
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:16,343
the lack of synchronization at that time.

225
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:19,931
And finally, we talked so much that it was a kilo of sugar,

226
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:22,767
as happy as if he had gone with Lelia.

227
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:32,193
His son Julian was born in Paris in 1974.

228
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:35,655
There's my future colleague and co-director.

229
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,162
Lélia continued to support Sebastiao around as a young mother.

230
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:43,414
He worked hard in their studies

231
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,667
and to present the work of Sebastiao everywhere.

232
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:50,003
In magazines, newspapers and agencies.

233
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:51,130
And so,

234
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:54,259
after some relevant publications,

235
00:21:54,802 --> 00:22:00,266
both they found the courage to conceive her first major photographic project.

236
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:04,813
"Other Americas".

237
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:09,692
It would take Sebastiao throughout South America.

238
00:22:10,152 --> 00:22:11,819
The small Juliano got used

239
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:15,530
the long absences of her father.

240
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:21,454
OTHER AMERICAS

241
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:26,794
After leaving Brazil in 1969,

242
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,923
I started to really miss Latin America.

243
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,799
And I decided to make a trip

244
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:36,180
to neighboring Brazil.

245
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:40,183
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia ...

246
00:22:40,477 --> 00:22:45,313
Also it sounded to see mountains of Latin America.

247
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,023
The Andes.

248
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:53,405
At that time, Latin America, there was a profound social upheaval.

249
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:56,490
Theology of Liberation.

250
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:02,414
On that trip I met a young priest in Ecuador,

251
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,458
Gabicho named.

252
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:09,047
We fear the same age, a young photographer and a young priest.

253
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,009
He was the one who carried the word of God,

254
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:17,971
farmers organized into cooperatives, introducing solidarity.

255
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:21,894
And when he had all these communities to reach,

256
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,355
I could make impressive trips.

257
00:23:29,987 --> 00:23:32,613
Here we were more than 3,000 meters.

258
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:38,036
Sometimes we climbed slopes of 600 to 700 meters per day.

259
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:42,666
But I greatly enjoyed living in this landscape,

260
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,585
in those communities.

261
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:52,175
These are the Saraguros, a group of Indians in southern Ecuador.

262
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:57,307
Very religious, but also heavy drinkers of alcohol.

263
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:02,644
More than half of the community, on weekends, men and women

264
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,065
They are completely drunk.

265
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:10,153
The farmer left

266
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:13,406
It called Lupe, Guadalupe.

267
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:17,577
Lupe was my friend.

268
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:21,207
At that time, I had very long hair,

269
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,210
blonde and very long.

270
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,546
And he had a big beard, redhead and blonde.

271
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:31,676
One day we were walking through the mountains,

272
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,430
He approached me and told me. "Look, Sebastiao,

273
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,476
I know that you have sent from heaven. "

274
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:42,480
Because according to legend Saraguros

275
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:46,358
the gods, to the image of Christ,

276
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:50,989
They return to Earth to see them, to observe

277
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,699
and see who deserved heaven.

278
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:59,580
While touring the mountains, he took the opportunity to tell his life.

279
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:06,461
He firmly believed that I was there to observe them.

280
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,509
And up there counting their behavior.

281
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:19,394
I had never seen before, an entire people

282
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,191
another rhythm of time.

283
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:29,821
The time I spent with Saraguros seemed a hundred years.

284
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:32,325
Everything was so slow.

285
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:36,828
It was another way of thinking, another speed.

286
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,875
There were fatalism in their faces.

287
00:25:45,464 --> 00:25:48,383
This is in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico,

288
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:52,135
is a group of peasants called mixes.

289
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:58,685
There, everything is medieval, the plow, all ...

290
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,317
It was the profound Latin America.

291
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,820
He was a peasant village,

292
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,243
but more important was the music that community.

293
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:17,830
It was a people who loved music.

294
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:24,087
All members of the community who could play an instrument

295
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:26,589
They did not need to work.

296
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,218
They worked as musicians.

297
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:36,893
They let me sleep a few days

298
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,188
in a cement room, very cold,

299
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:45,442
to see if reluctant, if you really wanted to stay.

300
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:48,447
As I managed to resist,

301
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,575
I was taken from there and took me to a house.

302
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:54,619
I went more to the community.

303
00:26:54,828 --> 00:26:56,330
And for me it was a pleasure.

304
00:26:56,664 --> 00:27:00,251
We became friends and coexisted in harmony in the community.

305
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:12,262
This is in northern Mexico, are the Tarahumara.

306
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:17,227
They are great runners are runners.

307
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,270
They walk away.

308
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:22,732
My God, it was hell follow these aborigines

309
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:25,819
they were not walking, flying!

310
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:35,747
This is a Tarahumara,

311
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:40,501
with his face well marked, well lived.

312
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:46,759
With her beautiful hair, great hair.

313
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:52,140
Several times they came to my camera

314
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:56,729
and they made me feel a sound technician.

315
00:27:57,771 --> 00:28:02,400
They told me things like I was recording them.

316
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:12,827
The strength of a portrait is that in that split second

317
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:17,833
We understand a little the life of the person photographed.

318
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:21,837
The eyes speak volumes, the expression of the face.

319
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:27,803
When you do a portrait, is not you alone who takes the picture.

320
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:30,305
The person offers photo.

321
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:37,771
Those trips were very important to me.

322
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:44,987
To return after years without stepping on my country, to be here.

323
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:48,991
The essence was the same, it was my continent, we were very close.

324
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:55,874
"Other Americas" led him to Sebastiao eight years.

325
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,211
On this trip to South America deeper

326
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:03,465
he simply disappeared for long periods.

327
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:07,720
Julian grew up with a father who was almost always absent.

328
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:11,682
His parents could at least correspond.

329
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:15,938
Clearly this occurred before the current media.

330
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:20,317
Each time he returned home to see his family

331
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:23,111
and edit your photos with Lelia.

332
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:26,950
Sebastiao seemed like a great adventurer to his son.

333
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:30,953
A superhero, rather than a photographer.

334
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,078
i And cut!

335
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:36,709
I am, thirty years later.

336
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:40,423
Finally, I joined my father in one of his missions.

337
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:42,214
A Wrangel,

338
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:45,426
a desert island in the Arctic Ocean.

339
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:48,262
Sebastiao hoped to photograph

340
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:51,182
the last great gathering of walruses.

341
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,394
I wanted to find out who the man was,

342
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,232
the man he had only known as father.

343
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:07,326
I wanted to find the photographer, adventurer, for the first time.

344
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:32,750
Cursed Bear!

345
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,417
We had the bear.

346
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:38,380
Incredible! It has made everyone from getting into the water.

347
00:32:17,257 --> 00:32:18,964
What are you thinking?

348
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,719
What are you thinking, Father?

349
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,182
I'm thinking, you know, doing this will be difficult.

350
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,810
I do not know if it's okay.

351
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:52,751
It is different when the bear is close, we can take a picture with him closely.

352
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:55,211
But with a scenario that is not good.

353
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,383
We have a document of the bear, but we do not have a photo.

354
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:02,304
This is not right.

355
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,847
There's nothing behind.

356
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:09,602
Nothing to frame the photo, to beautify the landscape.

357
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:17,028
Not have stock, we have nothing.

358
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:53,590
Awesome!

359
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:57,137
The image I had in the end, are the teeth out,

360
00:36:57,262 --> 00:37:00,514
They could not discern the shapes of heads, stunning.

361
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:03,434
Like we were in Dante's Inferno,

362
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:05,728
with all those teeth,

363
00:37:05,855 --> 00:37:08,021
all these forms ... Incredible!

364
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:32,925
Father, talk to me a little of your 1979?

365
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:40,139
In 79, Lélia was pregnant, expecting her second child.

366
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,476
It would be child already knew.

367
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:46,563
And when Rodrigo was born,

368
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:51,612
everything was going to be Down syndrome.

369
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:55,907
It was nice, torn eyes,

370
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:59,911
and I had the impression that it was completely normal.

371
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:01,788
And also Lélia.

372
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:08,670
The doctor did many tests. Three weeks await your response.

373
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:10,922
The day I called the doctor

374
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:15,012
I felt such a strong tension,

375
00:38:15,137 --> 00:38:17,722
when I saw the answer, I cried.

376
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:19,849
He could not stop mourn.

377
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:29,440
My little brother would never be able to go to school,

378
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:32,947
or read and write like me.

379
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:37,076
Rodrigo would be isolated in a world that we were never going to be able to share.

380
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:40,829
It was very difficult for my parents.

381
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,166
But then something happened.

382
00:38:44,043 --> 00:38:47,586
Thanks to love, Rodrigo created his own language.

383
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:49,672
Slowly,

384
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,969
as a family, we learned to decipher their emotional alphabet

385
00:38:54,094 --> 00:38:56,512
and communicate without words.

386
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:05,188
Poce later, my mother, my brother and I took a plane to Brazil.

387
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:08,150
The military dictatorship had fallen.

388
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:13,780
Topic five years and did not understand how important this trip was going to be.

389
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:18,077
At one point, a man climbed one of the blinds

390
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:21,748
and sunlight flooded the interior of the aircraft.

391
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,918
A voice echoed in the cabin:

392
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:27,172
"We are flying over Brazil."

393
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:30,842
My mother looked out the window and said nothing.

394
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:35,554
He was seeing his homeland for the first time after many years.

395
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:39,851
It was a moment of happiness, and yet, when I looked,

396
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:42,019
I was crying.

397
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:49,237
My father was in French Guiana and would come later.

398
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,199
December 31, returning to Brazil.

399
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:57,411
It was great to get to your country,

400
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,164
After 10 years, half out.

401
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:06,545
It was shocking. Lelia had left the Vitoria was not found.

402
00:40:07,382 --> 00:40:11,175
Vitória urbanism had changed. Everything had changed.

403
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:14,639
My region had changed.

404
00:40:15,306 --> 00:40:20,228
I met again with my parents. The I left young and strong.

405
00:40:20,436 --> 00:40:24,983
On returning I found an old man. My father was very old.

406
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,152
But, at that time,

407
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:30,780
I wanted to see Brazil further.

408
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:33,742
My sister gave me a car

409
00:40:34,952 --> 00:40:38,329
and I traveled for six months in the northeast of Brazil.

410
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:40,456
He did not know the northeast.

411
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,920
He had always dreamed of northeastern Brazil.

412
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:09,487
I met these people on a funeral.

413
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:14,409
I parked on the side of the road and went with them.

414
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:21,376
Infant mortality was very high in the northeast of Brazil.

415
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:25,547
These are children who died before baptism.

416
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,677
It is believed that unbaptized children

417
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:34,681
They have no right to go to heaven.

418
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,643
They stay in a region between both worlds, called limbo.

419
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:45,693
Children buried with his eyes closed, they were baptized.

420
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,487
If his eyes were open ...

421
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:51,032
and they buried him to find his way.

422
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:55,871
Otherwise, it was wandering for eternity.

423
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:08,592
At that time, the coffins were rented in the church.

424
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,179
Rent the coffin was cheaper.

425
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:15,182
The same coffin was used dozens of times.

426
00:42:21,858 --> 00:42:26,112
This is perfectly seen the coffins to rent ...

427
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:30,949
and these are shoes.

428
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:35,496
He sold everything: shoes, coffins, bananas, vegetables,

429
00:42:35,706 --> 00:42:38,541
ice cream, all ...

430
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:45,130
It is an area of ??the world where life and death are very close.

431
00:42:48,637 --> 00:42:52,889
Here is a prayer group

432
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:56,601
exerting political work at the same time.

433
00:42:57,353 --> 00:43:00,855
In Brazil, we had and still have

434
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:04,068
a great movement of landless peasants.

435
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:08,864
Many of them, the majority come from here.

436
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:12,242
Proviene del northeast of Brazil.

437
00:43:19,126 --> 00:43:20,126
They are people

438
00:43:20,503 --> 00:43:23,130
a great moral force,

439
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:25,717
great physical strength,

440
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:30,804
despite being very fragile because they eat poorly.

441
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:35,476
Look at the dryness of the area. It is very dry.

442
00:43:36,186 --> 00:43:40,273
Why so, we have a piece of Sahel here in Brazil.

443
00:43:43,277 --> 00:43:45,237
And here in the street,

444
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:48,490
people leave for good.

445
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,871
Sometimes the land is so dry, so hard,

446
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,579
people migrate to cities in the south.

447
00:43:54,706 --> 00:43:57,876
They give up, leave the land.

448
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,898
FARM SALGALO

449
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,028
MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

450
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:27,532
We have spent many years suffering a shortage of rain.

451
00:44:41,632 --> 00:44:46,760
Here we had many cattle.

452
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:49,139
Now we have nothing, it's over.

453
00:44:50,182 --> 00:44:52,202
The drought was great.

454
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:56,342
He finished with pastures, ended income.

455
00:44:56,896 --> 00:44:58,731
How it ended, Grandpa? Why it's over?

456
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:00,751
It ended because of the drought.

457
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:07,742
He stood around, but no one saw or a grass grow.

458
00:45:07,867 --> 00:45:09,911
Now we just have time.

459
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,788
Between your father and I,

460
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:15,916
20,000 invested in that.

461
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,585
Where you are?

462
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:21,505
Here he abounded all.

463
00:45:22,132 --> 00:45:26,637
There were many birds many sparrows.

464
00:45:27,054 --> 00:45:30,641
Canarios, tico-ticos,

465
00:45:31,434 --> 00:45:32,934
zorzales ...

466
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:38,148
There on the hill, there was a good kill.

467
00:45:38,275 --> 00:45:42,237
And in that summit also he had a very good head.

468
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,865
There is much erosion.

469
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:47,795
Now, for example, the land is bonded.

470
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:52,153
If rains come, there no grass, nothing,

471
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:56,293
to hold, cause a disaster.

472
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:59,172
I have no idea ...

473
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:02,739
to know how to stop erosion.

474
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:14,521
He grandfather, he was in the hacienda happy?

475
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:15,648
What?

476
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,525
If I was in this hacienda happy?

477
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:21,987
?Si was happy?

478
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:24,989
I was happy to have my children.

479
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,701
I raised all, seven women,

480
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,746
with six career as Tiao.

481
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:34,000
I raised my children here with difficulty.

482
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:35,710
I was happy.

483
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,730
Only wood I took over a hundred contos

484
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:45,512
to take my children to school.

485
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:49,016
All were raised with good nutrition

486
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:51,309
with good clothes.

487
00:46:56,983 --> 00:47:01,237
Since I arrived in Brazil, the land of my grandfather have been.

488
00:47:01,614 --> 00:47:04,907
Burned and dry.

489
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:10,246
When Sebastiao returned to the farm after traveling the northeast of Brazil,

490
00:47:10,373 --> 00:47:14,376
the place had nothing to do with paradise he remembered as a child.

491
00:47:14,795 --> 00:47:18,005
But he worried about something else.

492
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,717
The suffering he saw, changed.

493
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:25,929
His role as a photographer took on new meaning.

494
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:29,101
We understood how important it was for him to leave.

495
00:47:30,811 --> 00:47:36,525
She missed him terribly, but I understood.

496
00:47:45,284 --> 00:47:48,077
Sahel, THE END OF THE ROAD 1984-1986

497
00:47:48,204 --> 00:47:52,416
For his next project, which would lead to Sahel in Africa,

498
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:56,380
Sebastiao began working with MSF.

499
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,889
I worked in Ethiopia in 1984.

500
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:10,601
And then I continued throughout the Sahel, 85 and 86.

501
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:14,775
Finally, spend nearly two years in a row in this region

502
00:48:14,902 --> 00:48:18,235
doing a story about hunger.

503
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:23,659
There was a refugee camp,

504
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:26,952
the largest in the history of mankind so far.

505
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:30,373
I had a wild desire to show that.

506
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:34,503
To show that there was a large part of humanity

507
00:48:34,755 --> 00:48:37,590
He is living in poverty.

508
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:41,802
Which it was mostly a problem of deals

509
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:45,597
not just a question of natural disasters.

510
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:51,063
It was a Coptic region

511
00:48:51,188 --> 00:48:55,275
They are Christians in northern Ethiopia,

512
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,737
of tremendous humility.

513
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,822
They are unable, even with a child about to die,

514
00:49:00,949 --> 00:49:03,617
to take the lead of others.

515
00:49:03,742 --> 00:49:05,661
They prefer to wait.

516
00:49:12,253 --> 00:49:14,753
Look at the state are.

517
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:20,469
In that state, one does not stand long.

518
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:24,514
In those fields hunger killed many lives.

519
00:49:25,057 --> 00:49:28,309
Causes physical discomfort,

520
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:31,396
but other diseases that they kill.

521
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:37,862
If we take the anger, we become dehydrated quickly.

522
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:42,407
We can lose up to 12 liters of fluid a day due to diarrhea

523
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:45,327
and die in two or three days.

524
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,503
So young faces

525
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:57,509
and so aged by suffering.

526
00:49:57,925 --> 00:50:01,262
If you look at the front, it is not elderly,

527
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:05,099
it has aged are the eyes, which are empty.

528
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:08,478
Look how young he is. Look at your baby.

529
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:10,938
He was her husband.

530
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:19,197
During the night because of the cold, many deaths they occur.

531
00:50:22,744 --> 00:50:26,704
Dying here is like a continuation of life.

532
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:29,376
People get used to die.

533
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:34,340
A husband to his wife washed before burial.

534
00:50:37,552 --> 00:50:41,889
With mountain clothes, dressed in goatskins.

535
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:47,644
A pretty young woman.

536
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,610
According to Coptic beliefs,

537
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:59,657
the body must be clean for the encounter with God.

538
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:02,952
It should be washed, wash it all

539
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:05,998
although water is scarce.

540
00:51:09,795 --> 00:51:13,672
Every person killed is a piece of the world that dies.

541
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:25,351
A father prepares his son for burial,

542
00:51:25,478 --> 00:51:27,980
to say the last goodbye.

543
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:33,860
Usually it is the family that prepares its dead.

544
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:43,746
And know that the government

545
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:48,793
retains food, not allowed to reach the population

546
00:51:48,918 --> 00:51:51,880
as happened there,

547
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:54,550
in that field in northern Ethiopia ...

548
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:59,346
It was a brutal political dishonesty.

549
00:52:11,193 --> 00:52:13,987
Ethiopia Tigray Region, 1984

550
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:18,949
I returned to Ethiopia in late 1984.

551
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:23,996
By then, the guerrillas realized that the government was plundering the region.

552
00:52:24,123 --> 00:52:27,251
They began to send people to Sudan.

553
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:31,047
They went through the region of Tigray.

554
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:37,344
There was an attack by two helicopters.

555
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:41,184
They were Mi-24 combat helicopters very fast.

556
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:43,851
They shot people with machine guns.

557
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:47,731
I took a picture and ran.

558
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,030
Many pregnant women walked

559
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:59,742
hoping to be able to eat and drink water

560
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:02,579
to reach the promised land.

561
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:09,045
I had to go there

562
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:12,255
at least two more months.

563
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:15,009
And when I arrived in Sudan,

564
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:18,512
I had a lot of work with the arrival of these people.

565
00:53:22,768 --> 00:53:25,271
This man came from Ethiopia.

566
00:53:25,396 --> 00:53:28,773
His son was exhausted, perhaps dead,

567
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,193
but the man was carrying.

568
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,530
When he got to the doctors the child was dead,

569
00:53:36,157 --> 00:53:38,494
after so much walking.

570
00:53:47,003 --> 00:53:50,213
We had to decamp from MSF.

571
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:53,634
Water is essential in these camps

572
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,552
and it was becoming a big problem.

573
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:58,931
You had to move as quickly as possible.

574
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:07,231
They piled into the trucks of the United Nations

575
00:54:07,483 --> 00:54:10,943
to take them to another camp,

576
00:54:11,155 --> 00:54:14,447
a beautiful and fertile land

577
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:17,242
on the banks of the Blue Nile.

578
00:54:18,161 --> 00:54:22,373
I did about 300, 400 kilometers aboard these trucks.

579
00:54:26,253 --> 00:54:28,463
Two of my friends truck,

580
00:54:28,588 --> 00:54:32,760
They acted as if it were a Sunday afternoon either,

581
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:36,471
and they were telling stories under a tree.

582
00:54:40,184 --> 00:54:43,438
Being close to the Nile, we had water.

583
00:54:43,563 --> 00:54:47,318
But here people died

584
00:54:47,568 --> 00:54:49,485
because there was no food.

585
00:54:49,777 --> 00:54:52,780
They reached the edge of poverty.

586
00:54:56,536 --> 00:55:00,873
They forgot or could not bring food.

587
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:03,793
There was a disorganization of food.

588
00:55:03,918 --> 00:55:06,128
They said there was, that there was.

589
00:55:06,253 --> 00:55:09,090
And when I got here there was nothing.

590
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,646
Me fui a Mali.

591
00:55:23,483 --> 00:55:26,317
Here too there was a great drought.

592
00:55:28,068 --> 00:55:31,280
The skin of the people were like the bark of trees.

593
00:55:31,614 --> 00:55:35,367
Trees marked by wind and sand,

594
00:55:35,786 --> 00:55:39,081
by sandstorms.

595
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,217
There were only women and children.

596
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:54,096
The men went to Libya to work,

597
00:55:54,222 --> 00:55:59,434
or they migrated to Ivory Coast in search of work

598
00:55:59,561 --> 00:56:03,356
with the promise to return and bring food for the family.

599
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:05,942
But very few returned.

600
00:56:15,994 --> 00:56:18,288
All were safe

601
00:56:18,414 --> 00:56:21,291
because MSF did a great job.

602
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:24,545
They brought aid to the region.

603
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:30,885
This is a friend, Luc, a Belgian doctor.

604
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:36,556
It is measuring and weighing the child.

605
00:56:38,811 --> 00:56:42,396
After 15, 20 days, they were unrecognizable, healthier.

606
00:56:42,523 --> 00:56:45,231
But they were scarred for life

607
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,737
because they lacked things during growth.

608
00:56:55,077 --> 00:56:56,744
This kid was alone,

609
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,666
with his little guitar in hand,

610
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:04,338
He is carrying the remains of a shirt,

611
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,423
but not wearing pants.

612
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:11,762
Watch her determination, her posture.

613
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:15,224
He is someone who knows where it goes.

614
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:19,896
Looking for other groups of people,

615
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:22,023
with your dog ...

616
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:24,985
A boy of eight, nine years.

617
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:33,327
Sebastian is encarinó

618
00:57:33,454 --> 00:57:36,663
with the people of the Sahel region.

619
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:38,833
Again and again.

620
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:45,047
Photos, the book and the exhibition of Lélia

621
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:47,842
They called the world's attention on droughts,

622
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:50,137
and the fate of millions of lives.

623
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:54,807
And unanswered questions about the cause of that situation.

624
00:57:56,853 --> 00:58:01,440
Then Sebastiao turned to a topic that he spent another six years

625
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:05,778
and countless trips to almost thirty countries.

626
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:07,237
WORKERS

627
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:12,552
The third volume of photographs conceived with Lélia.

628
00:58:12,577 --> 00:58:16,206
I wanted to pay a kind of homage

629
00:58:16,748 --> 00:58:20,668
all men and women who built our world.

630
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,177
The archeology of the industrial era.

631
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:28,010
Sebastian y Lelia investigaron

632
00:58:28,135 --> 00:58:30,804
and planned "Workers" meticulously.

633
00:58:31,514 --> 00:58:35,559
Then he again traveled to the four corners of the world.

634
00:58:37,728 --> 00:58:40,012
He photographed steelworkers in the Soviet Union,

635
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:42,108
he lived with saboteurs ships in Bangladesh,

636
00:58:42,733 --> 00:58:45,737
sailed with fishermen in Galicia and Sicily,

637
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:49,032
He showed the mechanical production of cars in Kolkata.

638
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:51,452
He watched farmers in Rwanda,

639
00:58:51,577 --> 00:58:54,621
country had already visited, but as an economist.

640
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:57,625
Now the mission was another.

641
00:58:57,793 --> 00:59:01,545
His perspective had changed, but he was the same.

642
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,673
Driven by the same empathy for the human condition.

643
00:59:06,219 --> 00:59:09,012
With each episode of "workers"

644
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:11,597
Sebastiao was completely submerged

645
00:59:12,724 --> 00:59:15,141
in the field of manual labor.

646
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:18,731
As the weeks passed with miners in the gold mines of Serra Pelada.

647
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:26,324
In 1991, at the end of the first Gulf War,

648
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,865
Iraqi troops withdrew

649
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:31,590
and Saddam Hussein set fire to thousands of oil wells.

650
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:37,166
Thousands of firefighters from around the world descended on those oil fields.

651
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,588
Sebastiao had to go too,

652
00:59:40,713 --> 00:59:44,592
driven by curiosity of this explosive profession.

653
00:59:53,434 --> 00:59:56,561
When I saw the first images on TV,

654
00:59:57,523 --> 01:00:00,942
I knew I had to do that report.

655
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:05,739
It was like working in a big theater.

656
01:00:06,282 --> 01:00:08,574
Some 500 wells on fire.

657
01:00:08,701 --> 01:00:13,121
A scene set in huge, the size of a planet.

658
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:17,751
No controlled us, we could go where we wanted.

659
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:23,425
There were fumes, thick smoke, oil.

660
01:00:24,009 --> 01:00:28,721
All that accumulated smoke was so dense that the sun did not pass.

661
01:00:29,182 --> 01:00:35,644
Sometimes it was dark 24 hours.

662
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,987
After putting out the fire

663
01:00:44,112 --> 01:00:47,074
the ground was so hot,

664
01:00:47,201 --> 01:00:51,369
I had to throw a lot of water for cooling,

665
01:00:51,496 --> 01:00:56,168
if not, the temperature was so high that oil burn again.

666
01:00:57,545 --> 01:00:59,253
Still, sometimes,

667
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,592
There was an explosion that sounded like a cannon.

668
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,844
The noise was deafening.

669
01:01:06,971 --> 01:01:10,807
It was like working near the engine of a plane.

670
01:01:11,476 --> 01:01:13,643
Today I'm a little deaf.

671
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,231
My deafness began then.

672
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:34,414
These are Canadians,

673
01:01:34,543 --> 01:01:37,210
The Calgary Fire Department.

674
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:41,423
They brought a nice red truck.

675
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:45,012
And they had a rule: after putting out the fire,

676
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:48,306
I had to wash the truck every night.

677
01:01:48,431 --> 01:01:51,768
The next morning, returned to be covered in oil.

678
01:01:57,567 --> 01:01:59,777
A hell of a job!

679
01:02:03,072 --> 01:02:05,032
I delayed my departure at least two or three times.

680
01:02:06,786 --> 01:02:08,661
Until the day I had to leave.

681
01:02:08,788 --> 01:02:12,041
It broke my heart

682
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:15,543
having to leave such a huge show.

683
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,797
I turned around,

684
01:02:19,923 --> 01:02:22,467
until near the end,

685
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,639
when we passed a big wall.

686
01:02:26,764 --> 01:02:30,268
That day was a reporter for the New York Times.

687
01:02:30,976 --> 01:02:35,315
It was no longer anyone's territory. The war had destroyed everything.

688
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:37,483
We broke the door.

689
01:02:37,733 --> 01:02:39,152
Upon entering,

690
01:02:39,945 --> 01:02:42,487
a species discovered

691
01:02:42,614 --> 01:02:44,074
Paradise

692
01:02:44,201 --> 01:02:46,242
become a hell.

693
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:50,956
It was a kind of Garden of the royal family of Kuwait.

694
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:55,251
There were horses, thoroughbreds,

695
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:59,215
they had gone completely mad.

696
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:03,969
The animals are the first to escape before a catastrophe,

697
01:03:04,096 --> 01:03:06,639
if they are free to escape.

698
01:03:06,974 --> 01:03:09,184
But there they were not.

699
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:13,230
Birds found there, it was an oasis.

700
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,565
Everything was well irrigated.

701
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:20,947
Birds that could not fly because they were glued feathers.

702
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:27,954
Kuwaitis left to reach the disaster

703
01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:31,875
leaving the confined animals,

704
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:35,670
together with the Bedouins, who are not considered human beings.

705
01:03:37,657 --> 01:03:42,090
"Workers" managed to unite the Sebastiao Salgado economist

706
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:44,221
with the artist in which he had become.

707
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:48,016
These photographs have been published in the best journals,

708
01:03:48,143 --> 01:03:50,184
the exhibition toured the world,

709
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:53,063
and the book was published in many languages.

710
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,610
Pero Sebastian y Lelia in pararon.

711
01:03:58,153 --> 01:04:02,990
They immediately began work on a new phase of his photography.

712
01:04:03,242 --> 01:04:07,371
They noted that another burning issue of our times

713
01:04:07,704 --> 01:04:10,456
It was the displacement of entire populations

714
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:14,503
due to wars, famines and the role of the global market.

715
01:04:15,463 --> 01:04:18,967
As Europe closed its borders,

716
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:23,762
Sebastiao trying to shed light on the lives of the marginalized.

717
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:29,394
Again with Lelia, he began researching and planning.

718
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,483
She was again the momentum of this new chapter

719
01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:35,858
which they called "Exodus".

720
01:04:36,402 --> 01:04:38,027
EXODUS

721
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:43,034
It sparked global concern about the lives of these refugees

722
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:45,202
de India, Vietnam, Filipinas,

723
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:47,371
South America, Palestine, Iraq

724
01:04:47,498 --> 01:04:49,291
and many other places.

725
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:53,795
But Sebastiao returned again and again to the continent

726
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,717
I had captivated his imagination for some time already.

727
01:04:58,217 --> 01:04:59,802
A África.

728
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:13,898
I was doing my project on population movements

729
01:05:16,652 --> 01:05:19,905
in 1994, when the Rwandan president's plane

730
01:05:20,492 --> 01:05:22,492
He was killed.

731
01:05:23,244 --> 01:05:26,579
It all started with a great movement of population to Tanzania

732
01:05:26,706 --> 01:05:31,585
due to the brutal repression against the Tutsis in Rwanda.

733
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:36,672
And I was one of the first to arrive.

734
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:39,550
It was a catastrophe.

735
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:42,014
People who fled to Burundi,

736
01:05:42,264 --> 01:05:44,599
al Congo, a Uganda...

737
01:05:44,726 --> 01:05:46,893
They fled to everywhere.

738
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:54,985
The streets were full of people.

739
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:00,157
People resting on the side of the road,

740
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:04,121
he carried all their belongings on bicycles ...

741
01:06:04,246 --> 01:06:07,206
People who fled with what they could.

742
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:11,585
We follow the path in the opposite direction.

743
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,088
We went to the border.

744
01:06:15,215 --> 01:06:17,967
There was no security, no nothing.

745
01:06:18,092 --> 01:06:22,181
I came to Rwanda and that was frightening.

746
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:26,936
The death toll I met on these roads.

747
01:06:29,731 --> 01:06:31,565
It had broken Granada.

748
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:36,737
Those who were not killed by the Granada were killed with machetes.

749
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:40,990
I understood the magnitude

750
01:06:41,117 --> 01:06:44,954
the catastrophe he was seeing.

751
01:06:45,831 --> 01:06:48,626
Genocide was committed in that country.

752
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:56,425
Were about 150 kilometers to the outskirts of Kigali,

753
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:59,304
and 150 kilometers of dead.

754
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:11,065
I returned because my story was about you people.

755
01:07:11,192 --> 01:07:15,195
He was writing a book on refugees, on the exodus.

756
01:07:15,655 --> 01:07:17,782
I went into these camps

757
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:19,909
and I began to see

758
01:07:20,034 --> 01:07:23,829
the number of people who left Rwanda.

759
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,835
Hell settled in this paradise.

760
01:07:29,753 --> 01:07:32,297
It was frightening

761
01:07:32,422 --> 01:07:36,010
see how in such a beautiful savanna

762
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:39,262
He had formed a megacity.

763
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:45,686
Within days, there were almost a million people there.

764
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,157
Amid all this anguish, something touched me very much.

765
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,992
It was seeing this mother with her little,

766
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:03,871
and little confidence in her mother.

767
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,720
Violence

768
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:21,056
and brutality

769
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:24,560
they are not a monopoly

770
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:26,645
of distant countries.

771
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:30,024
It is here, in Europe, in the former Yugoslavia.

772
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,153
It's very shocking.

773
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:38,868
On a bus coming from Krajina, Croatia across ...

774
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:42,412
One person was killed through that hole.

775
01:08:42,538 --> 01:08:46,542
Croats killed many people to leave Krajina.

776
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:49,045
Violence is widespread.

777
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:52,506
What I dislike most

778
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:56,720
It is to see how much hatred is contagious.

779
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,890
These people have seen violence.

780
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:01,557
Entire families.

781
01:09:01,685 --> 01:09:05,855
All Krajina Serb population was expelled.

782
01:09:08,024 --> 01:09:12,403
From time to time they were driven from their homes

783
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:14,780
looking for a place where to go.

784
01:09:14,907 --> 01:09:19,368
They had their neighbors in front and shooting at them.

785
01:09:34,345 --> 01:09:37,305
This is a refugee camp near Tuzla,

786
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:40,890
en la Bosnia central.

787
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:43,979
They are families fleeing the enclave of Zepa,

788
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:48,149
where Serbs killed thousands of young people.

789
01:09:49,153 --> 01:09:54,363
We were there at the right time. Just as families arrived

790
01:09:54,949 --> 01:09:57,536
in a state of high anxiety.

791
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:11,884
There were only women, elderly

792
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:13,842
and children.

793
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:18,390
The young men had been detained or killed.

794
01:10:24,605 --> 01:10:27,524
It is rare that this happens in Europe,

795
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:30,819
the late twentieth century.

796
01:10:31,154 --> 01:10:32,572
But here, the cars,

797
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:36,577
we can see that those people with a standard of living

798
01:10:36,703 --> 01:10:38,704
a European standard of living,

799
01:10:39,163 --> 01:10:41,873
with a European intellectual level.

800
01:10:42,207 --> 01:10:44,375
A European infrastructure.

801
01:10:44,752 --> 01:10:46,170
And who lost everything.

802
01:10:50,426 --> 01:10:54,386
Hundreds of kilometers filled with people and cars.

803
01:10:58,475 --> 01:11:00,353
We are a very fierce animal.

804
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:03,355
We are a terrible animal, we humans.

805
01:11:04,815 --> 01:11:08,610
It is here in Europe, whether in Africa, Latin America, wherever.

806
01:11:08,737 --> 01:11:11,404
Our violence is extreme.

807
01:11:18,247 --> 01:11:20,456
Our history is a history of wars.

808
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:29,172
It is a story without end,

809
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,426
a history of repression,

810
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:33,220
crazy story.

811
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:44,899
The situation in Rwanda continued to evolve.

812
01:11:45,109 --> 01:11:49,195
The Hutu army, which had the power, was defeated.

813
01:11:49,322 --> 01:11:54,409
And he retired to the Congo and the region of Goma.

814
01:11:55,746 --> 01:12:00,291
First, the Tutsis had fled the barbarity of the Hutus.

815
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:02,167
Then they were Hutus

816
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:05,005
those fleeing Tutsi occupation.

817
01:12:05,128 --> 01:12:07,172
So they all fled.

818
01:12:10,301 --> 01:12:12,136
In several days,

819
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:15,222
in the month of July 1994

820
01:12:15,349 --> 01:12:16,765
Goma region

821
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:19,935
He welcomed more than two million people.

822
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,024
And there catastrophe was installed,

823
01:12:27,029 --> 01:12:29,948
diseases such as cholera began to spread

824
01:12:30,073 --> 01:12:33,868
and people started dropping like flies.

825
01:12:34,328 --> 01:12:37,747
There were at least 12,000 or 15,000 deaths a day.

826
01:12:41,585 --> 01:12:44,503
I took pictures of piles of dead like this.

827
01:12:45,088 --> 01:12:47,757
I saw that father approached with his child,

828
01:12:48,175 --> 01:12:49,676
and throw it there.

829
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:54,014
He was chatting with fellow like that.

830
01:13:00,814 --> 01:13:03,898
We did not give supply to bury people.

831
01:13:04,943 --> 01:13:07,863
Machine brought a French army

832
01:13:08,114 --> 01:13:11,824
and caught galore, dozens,

833
01:13:12,077 --> 01:13:14,159
They threw them on the ground

834
01:13:14,286 --> 01:13:17,038
and covered with soil.

835
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,768
Everyone should see these images,

836
01:13:37,228 --> 01:13:40,145
to see how terrible it is our species.

837
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:50,158
These orphans, I found them on the road ...

838
01:13:52,037 --> 01:13:53,493
Of these three children

839
01:13:53,619 --> 01:13:57,207
the two with the most lively eyes will survive.

840
01:13:57,332 --> 01:14:01,377
The eyes of the morbid, he was dying.

841
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,801
When I left there, I was sick.

842
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:09,469
Very sick. My body was sick.

843
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,181
It was not an infectious disease,

844
01:14:13,475 --> 01:14:15,435
my soul was sick.

845
01:14:20,317 --> 01:14:24,403
I went to Rwanda a year after the disaster

846
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:29,326
for the return of Hutus, who were in the Congo

847
01:14:29,658 --> 01:14:31,577
and they had nowhere to go.

848
01:14:31,703 --> 01:14:36,039
The United Nations began to force them to return.

849
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,264
We felt that the whole planet was covered in refugee tents.

850
01:15:04,445 --> 01:15:06,447
After working there,

851
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:11,118
Tutsi authorities proposed visit me

852
01:15:11,244 --> 01:15:15,163
several places, scenes of repression.

853
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,801
People took refuge in a church thinking that could be saved.

854
01:15:27,512 --> 01:15:30,014
All were killed.

855
01:15:36,563 --> 01:15:38,773
This was at a school,

856
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:43,944
You can still see the blackboard with written when passing through.

857
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:46,155
it was scary.

858
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:04,257
Of people who left Rwanda, some two million people,

859
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:07,054
some returned to Rwanda,

860
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,889
but the other feared a possible crackdown.

861
01:16:10,015 --> 01:16:15,061
A group of 250,000 people left the city of Goma

862
01:16:15,186 --> 01:16:17,439
and he went into the Congo forest.

863
01:16:20,569 --> 01:16:21,860
We lost.

864
01:16:21,987 --> 01:16:25,948
Everyone knew they were lost 250,000 people.

865
01:16:26,074 --> 01:16:28,033
We did not know where they were.

866
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:32,579
Six months later,

867
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:37,793
They began to appear Kisangani in central Congo.

868
01:16:40,216 --> 01:16:43,884
They were in the forest for six months.

869
01:16:45,011 --> 01:16:50,265
And here, the UN High Commissioner was taking me right there.

870
01:16:51,434 --> 01:16:54,560
There was a train and rode me.

871
01:16:55,646 --> 01:16:59,024
The train, after leaving the food, he should return.

872
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:11,706
I spent three days with these people kept coming.

873
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:14,457
Groups and groups of people coming.

874
01:17:16,793 --> 01:17:20,297
But when you think about 250,000 people left,

875
01:17:20,423 --> 01:17:23,092
and 40,000 returnees ...

876
01:17:23,426 --> 01:17:27,471
210,000 people were missing.

877
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,818
And in parallel, life continued.

878
01:17:39,944 --> 01:17:44,657
Men who cut hair.

879
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:47,912
And this Congolese here,

880
01:17:48,036 --> 01:17:49,787
with his calculator

881
01:17:51,081 --> 01:17:56,627
dollars trying to collect people,

882
01:17:56,753 --> 01:18:00,006
currencies, and it was there trying to change them.

883
01:18:00,466 --> 01:18:04,886
In the middle of nowhere! Amid a forest isolated from everything.

884
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:13,520
At one point,

885
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:18,568
that the guerrillas Kisangani, which was protutsi,

886
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,070
and he began to cast these people.

887
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,988
To send them back.

888
01:18:23,114 --> 01:18:27,494
They had to walk another six months to return to Rwanda.

889
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:29,704
They began to kill some.

890
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:35,336
There, I met people who could not more.

891
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:38,756
They had begun to rave,

892
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:40,798
They had lost his mind.

893
01:18:40,926 --> 01:18:42,509
They had gone mad.

894
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:51,310
In fact, this people who were expelled,

895
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:54,021
We have not heard anything.

896
01:18:55,442 --> 01:18:57,902
I'm sure they were all killed.

897
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:10,789
This was my last trip, this sad adventure in Rwanda.

898
01:19:14,545 --> 01:19:16,671
I went there.

899
01:19:18,257 --> 01:19:23,011
He does not believe in anything. He did not believe in the salvation of the human race.

900
01:19:23,137 --> 01:19:25,805
We could not survive that.

901
01:19:25,931 --> 01:19:27,725
We did not deserve to live anymore.

902
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:29,810
No one deserved to live.

903
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:44,993
How many times I threw the camera down to mourn for what he saw?

904
01:19:51,376 --> 01:19:55,755
Sebastiao had peered into the heart of darkness

905
01:19:55,881 --> 01:19:59,466
and he questioned his work as a social photographer

906
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:02,720
and witness to the human condition.

907
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:07,143
What remained to be done after Rwanda?

908
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,029
At that time, my grandfather's health worsened.

909
01:20:19,655 --> 01:20:23,784
My parents had to return to Brazil to take over the farm.

910
01:20:24,368 --> 01:20:29,041
It was just barren land. They did not know what to do with that.

911
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:34,421
Birds, alligators and forests had disappeared.

912
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:38,649
There was no childhood memories of Sebastiao.

913
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:45,932
Then Lélia had a surprising idea.

914
01:20:46,059 --> 01:20:50,145
Why we not replant the forest that was here before?

915
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:57,404
The forest that was here before and that covered these hills

916
01:20:57,529 --> 01:20:59,529
It was the Atlantic Forest.

917
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:02,033
The Atlantic forest.

918
01:21:02,618 --> 01:21:04,912
No one had tried to replant.

919
01:21:05,412 --> 01:21:08,957
Let alone over 600 hectares.

920
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,962
The suggestion came from his desire Lélia

921
01:21:13,087 --> 01:21:15,465
to maintain the spirit of the family.

922
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:18,842
Anyway, they started using them

923
01:21:19,304 --> 01:21:21,637
and for the next 10 years

924
01:21:21,846 --> 01:21:26,351
what happened in that land was a miracle

925
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:30,104
which it became, from that moment, the "Terra Institute".

926
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:39,613
I remember during the first planting,

927
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:43,536
sometimes dreamed that night was dying all.

928
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:49,500
Because the soil was horrible. He was in such bad shape

929
01:21:49,627 --> 01:21:52,753
I wondered. Are the plants take root?

930
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:57,467
In the Atlantic Forest there were 400 different species,

931
01:21:57,594 --> 01:22:00,514
we did not have 400,

932
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:05,309
but just we planted 100 species, 150 ...

933
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,814
It is true that the first planting lost 60%.

934
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:13,652
In the second, 40.

935
01:22:13,777 --> 01:22:18,323
There were no books to teach to replant an Atlantic forest.

936
01:22:37,845 --> 01:22:39,804
I love coming here

937
01:22:40,349 --> 01:22:43,100
to see all these trees together.

938
01:22:43,351 --> 01:22:45,726
When you see this forest mass,

939
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:50,733
an idea of ??the effort involved in planting all this is done.

940
01:22:54,654 --> 01:22:56,322
When I was little,

941
01:22:56,655 --> 01:22:59,283
there was a small waterfall.

942
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:03,079
All year, here was a waterfall that fell.

943
01:23:03,206 --> 01:23:08,042
I came with my sisters and we made a picnic under the jump.

944
01:23:08,877 --> 01:23:11,337
There was still a lot of forest.

945
01:23:11,715 --> 01:23:12,838
Then

946
01:23:13,298 --> 01:23:16,844
when felled trees, the water disappeared.

947
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:21,265
Now our forest is young, needs lots of water.

948
01:23:23,225 --> 01:23:27,563
But within 10 or 15 years, when everything stabilizes,

949
01:23:27,689 --> 01:23:31,817
I'm sure it will reappear another beautiful waterfall.

950
01:23:53,716 --> 01:23:54,885
They are

951
01:23:55,929 --> 01:23:58,095
many small roads,

952
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:00,640
hundreds of small ways ...

953
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,225
Cows go there.

954
01:24:04,101 --> 01:24:08,481
Each leg of cow that sits on a small perimeter,

955
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:11,944
They are 200 or 250 kilos of blow.

956
01:24:12,069 --> 01:24:15,573
Crushes the earth, the dry,

957
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:17,574
and no longer sprout again nothing.

958
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,037
It is very interesting to note the difference

959
01:24:21,704 --> 01:24:26,292
of what it was before the Terra Institute, smooth pastures like this

960
01:24:26,418 --> 01:24:29,712
and the other a fully recovered ecosystem.

961
01:24:29,838 --> 01:24:32,173
With ten million trees replanted.

962
01:24:54,407 --> 01:24:55,573
Here we see

963
01:24:55,824 --> 01:25:00,497
cicada singing until he dies.

964
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:04,667
I'm sure it was not the tree.

965
01:25:04,792 --> 01:25:08,545
Are the termites that are assimilating.

966
01:25:08,671 --> 01:25:10,671
He will be buried here.

967
01:25:19,932 --> 01:25:24,646
Sometimes, just we look at a tree and think about its verticality, in its beauty.

968
01:25:24,773 --> 01:25:30,068
But everything depends on it, our water, our oxygen ...

969
01:25:30,194 --> 01:25:32,113
It is home to everyone.

970
01:25:32,572 --> 01:25:35,533
Ants, small insects, cicadas ...

971
01:25:35,658 --> 01:25:37,076
All are in the tree.

972
01:25:38,328 --> 01:25:42,664
It is very pleasant to touch a tree planting have helped.

973
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:46,627
It is here, well established, well robust.

974
01:25:46,836 --> 01:25:50,215
Within 30 years it will be as well.

975
01:25:50,466 --> 01:25:53,301
He is still very young, is growing.

976
01:25:54,637 --> 01:25:57,765
Look, the youngest there, very young, here.

977
01:25:57,891 --> 01:25:59,725
They may have erupted tonight,

978
01:26:00,601 --> 01:26:03,688
like Alice entering the wonderland.

979
01:26:04,354 --> 01:26:09,402
And most incredible is that it will become a tree 40 to 50 meters.

980
01:26:09,528 --> 01:26:12,613
And who will live 400 years, 500 years.

981
01:26:12,739 --> 01:26:15,242
Here there is a great power.

982
01:26:19,831 --> 01:26:24,126
Think that these trees have three months

983
01:26:24,252 --> 01:26:26,587
and will reach its climax at the 400 ...

984
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:32,426
Maybe we can measure from here

985
01:26:32,551 --> 01:26:34,720
the concept of eternity.

986
01:26:35,015 --> 01:26:37,390
Perhaps eternity can be measured.

987
01:26:40,353 --> 01:26:43,229
The first few days after saying: "We will plant a forest"

988
01:26:43,356 --> 01:26:48,275
I thought the route was a seed to a small tree, a plant ...

989
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:51,572
and that's it, but there is only a little plant, but a million.

990
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:54,658
And not just here.

991
01:26:54,784 --> 01:26:58,578
Also nearby. And more and more!

992
01:26:58,704 --> 01:27:02,042
And that's the most wonderful thing, this idea

993
01:27:04,087 --> 01:27:06,296
You may evolve, it can grow.

994
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:09,673
He's not someone's idea, but of all.

995
01:27:11,552 --> 01:27:15,264
Sampling method can replicate almost everywhere.

996
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:17,682
Of course, the species are not the same,

997
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:20,560
but the way of acting is the same

998
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:23,105
in all tropical forests.

999
01:27:36,329 --> 01:27:39,581
The land was the remedy to despair of Sebastiao.

1000
01:27:39,873 --> 01:27:44,627
The joy of seeing the trees grow, resurgent outbreaks,

1001
01:27:45,046 --> 01:27:50,342
He resurrected Sebastiao passion for photography.

1002
01:27:50,842 --> 01:27:55,806
Although Lélia and he knew they could not return to their old ways.

1003
01:27:56,225 --> 01:27:57,725
We conclude

1004
01:27:57,851 --> 01:28:01,563
that would start a new photographic project on the environment.

1005
01:28:01,773 --> 01:28:04,943
Of course, the first idea that came

1006
01:28:05,069 --> 01:28:07,862
It was to denounce the destruction of forests,

1007
01:28:07,987 --> 01:28:10,448
or pollution of the oceans,

1008
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:11,489
He did not care.

1009
01:28:11,615 --> 01:28:15,578
Then gradually we start thinking. Let's do a different project.

1010
01:28:16,246 --> 01:28:18,372
Let a tribute to the planet.

1011
01:28:18,748 --> 01:28:21,292
And we discover with surprise

1012
01:28:21,418 --> 01:28:24,253
nearly half of the planet

1013
01:28:24,796 --> 01:28:26,797
continues as the day of Genesis.

1014
01:28:29,676 --> 01:28:34,139
Many of my friends told me. "Do not get into that.

1015
01:28:34,265 --> 01:28:38,018
It is very risky. You are a good human, social photographer,

1016
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:41,773
and now you will enter in the field

1017
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:45,902
Photographers landscapes, animals. "

1018
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:48,404
I said, "It's okay, I'm going for it!

1019
01:28:48,529 --> 01:28:52,033
I will learn to photograph these things too. "

1020
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:54,077
And so I began the first story.

1021
01:28:54,622 --> 01:28:57,037
Galapagos wanted it.

1022
01:28:57,373 --> 01:29:02,168
Darwin wanted to understand what he understood.

1023
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:04,796
The same species,

1024
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:08,091
in very different ecosystems,

1025
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:10,511
They have evolved very differently.

1026
01:29:13,057 --> 01:29:16,226
Looking at this detail of the leg of the iguana,

1027
01:29:16,353 --> 01:29:19,354
I can not help thinking

1028
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:22,858
in the hand of a warrior of the Middle Ages.

1029
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:26,945
With its metal to protect shells.

1030
01:29:30,117 --> 01:29:32,076
Looking at the structure of the hand,

1031
01:29:32,202 --> 01:29:35,956
I see that the iguana is also my cousin,

1032
01:29:36,498 --> 01:29:39,251
who we come from the same cell.

1033
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:46,841
We were facing a being of this age.

1034
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:48,761
We are dealing with an authority,

1035
01:29:48,886 --> 01:29:51,680
with all its wrinkles, with all this knowledge.

1036
01:29:52,431 --> 01:29:57,939
Certainly, when Darwin was here, that turtle was an adult.

1037
01:29:58,564 --> 01:30:00,814
Maybe he saw Darwin. Who knows?

1038
01:30:03,652 --> 01:30:05,735
I remember one time I was very tired

1039
01:30:05,863 --> 01:30:11,201
because he had walked through lava fields for a long time.

1040
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,412
I had slept on the beach.

1041
01:30:14,287 --> 01:30:17,247
I felt something touch my leg.

1042
01:30:17,373 --> 01:30:20,043
I looked and it was a sea lion.

1043
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:22,462
Had another installed across.

1044
01:30:22,588 --> 01:30:24,966
In the end, there were three sea lions.

1045
01:30:25,676 --> 01:30:29,845
No man considered a predator, did not seem a threat.

1046
01:30:32,184 --> 01:30:34,934
It was my first story of nature,

1047
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:38,355
the first time photographing animals.

1048
01:30:41,944 --> 01:30:45,654
For 8 years, I had time to see ...

1049
01:30:47,323 --> 01:30:49,367
and understand the most important thing.

1050
01:30:49,492 --> 01:30:53,371
I am very nature as a turtle, like a tree,

1051
01:30:53,497 --> 01:30:55,039
like a stone.

1052
01:32:12,122 --> 01:32:14,372
His gaze remains extraordinary.

1053
01:32:17,295 --> 01:32:19,212
It is very deep.

1054
01:32:19,546 --> 01:32:22,381
I was up to me, I took a picture,

1055
01:32:22,509 --> 01:32:23,925
he put his finger in the mouth ...

1056
01:32:24,636 --> 01:32:28,136
He was looking for the first time in a mirror.

1057
01:32:28,262 --> 01:32:30,015
I was in front of him

1058
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:33,018
and he removed his finger, put it.

1059
01:32:33,144 --> 01:32:34,938
He began to understand that it was him.

1060
01:32:35,064 --> 01:32:40,444
It was acknowledging his image. I felt completely identified.

1061
01:32:54,877 --> 01:32:56,961
It's a family like ours,

1062
01:32:57,087 --> 01:33:00,131
a grandfather, a father, children.

1063
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:05,720
They will respect each other, you know?

1064
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:10,725
And when you go, you have to respect their ways.

1065
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:13,520
You have to sit in a particular way,

1066
01:33:13,646 --> 01:33:16,440
you have to respect their territory.

1067
01:33:16,565 --> 01:33:19,025
And then you receive.

1068
01:33:20,862 --> 01:33:23,988
I also became friends with a whale.

1069
01:33:29,247 --> 01:33:30,579
These are whales.

1070
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:33,375
In Argentina.

1071
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:39,756
An adult as this measures 35 meters and weighs 40 tons, more or less.

1072
01:33:41,007 --> 01:33:43,260
He was approaching, came to the ship.

1073
01:33:43,386 --> 01:33:45,512
I could touch it.

1074
01:33:45,639 --> 01:33:48,306
And it was amazing. That skin so sensitive!

1075
01:33:48,432 --> 01:33:49,975
While he is stroking,

1076
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:54,521
He saw his tail shaking, at 35 meters.

1077
01:33:54,648 --> 01:33:56,065
A phenomenal sensitivity.

1078
01:33:56,900 --> 01:34:01,028
We had a small vessel of not more than seven meters.

1079
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:04,408
I knew that if we looked strong, we could sink.

1080
01:34:04,533 --> 01:34:07,284
But he never touched the boat, never!

1081
01:34:07,412 --> 01:34:10,457
Sometimes he walked away and hit the sea with its tail.

1082
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:59,091
Oh, it's another world, it's incredible.

1083
01:34:59,216 --> 01:35:03,929
I'll see if I have another photo here of the Nenets.

1084
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:08,935
Check what does a Nenets.

1085
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,896
It's your house.

1086
01:35:16,403 --> 01:35:20,154
I nenets this report with what was preparing a long time.

1087
01:35:21,114 --> 01:35:25,327
Were 18 people and about 6,000 reindeer

1088
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:27,954
They are living in constant migration.

1089
01:35:29,791 --> 01:35:32,792
Here should be the 7pm.

1090
01:35:32,918 --> 01:35:36,047
About 8 light a fire

1091
01:35:36,173 --> 01:35:38,966
and make the only hot meal of the day.

1092
01:35:39,844 --> 01:35:43,220
After dinner, there are gatherings.

1093
01:35:43,346 --> 01:35:44,806
And the fire goes out.

1094
01:35:44,932 --> 01:35:50,688
While the fire burning is the temperature is pleasant: 15-20 degrees.

1095
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:53,649
Two hours later, it is already 30 below zero.

1096
01:35:57,194 --> 01:36:00,197
They are real cowboys of Siberia.

1097
01:36:00,323 --> 01:36:02,951
Always wear ties

1098
01:36:03,077 --> 01:36:06,246
around the neck, made of reindeer skin.

1099
01:36:07,207 --> 01:36:12,001
They wear leather boots with silver fox.

1100
01:36:12,712 --> 01:36:16,341
Sleep with their boots. A boot lasts a lifetime.

1101
01:36:31,606 --> 01:36:34,818
The Obi is a very special river,

1102
01:36:34,944 --> 01:36:36,902
a large river in Siberia.

1103
01:36:37,822 --> 01:36:41,533
This is about 47 kilometers long.

1104
01:36:44,497 --> 01:36:48,750
When you pass the Obi, you enter the Arctic Circle.

1105
01:36:50,836 --> 01:36:53,255
We have no horizon line, we have nothing.

1106
01:36:53,381 --> 01:36:58,135
We are on a white plate on the size of the universe.

1107
01:37:10,148 --> 01:37:13,568
Genesis made Sebastiao again travel the world

1108
01:37:13,943 --> 01:37:15,443
for nearly a decade.

1109
01:37:16,113 --> 01:37:20,743
It was to show nature, animals, places and people

1110
01:37:20,867 --> 01:37:23,703
They are living as the beginning of time.

1111
01:37:23,828 --> 01:37:26,414
A more optimistic view of the same planet

1112
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:31,670
Sebastiao had looked hurt and destroyed.

1113
01:37:33,256 --> 01:37:36,175
Genesis was to be his great work.

1114
01:37:36,301 --> 01:37:38,552
A love letter to the planet.

1115
01:37:53,944 --> 01:37:57,029
Zo'é had representations in writings of the sixteenth century Jesuits

1116
01:37:57,155 --> 01:38:00,618
Amazon coming and reported on a people

1117
01:38:00,743 --> 01:38:03,828
who wore a kind of tube in the lower lip.

1118
01:38:03,954 --> 01:38:07,207
These Indians never been seen.

1119
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:09,668
We thought it was a fable

1120
01:38:09,795 --> 01:38:12,087
or an invention of the Jesuits,

1121
01:38:12,215 --> 01:38:14,631
until the end of the forties,

1122
01:38:14,926 --> 01:38:17,176
when we contacted them again.

1123
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:21,889
Estado de Paré, Brasil Tribe Zoe, 2009

1124
01:39:47,148 --> 01:39:49,524
These Indians live in paradise.

1125
01:39:50,694 --> 01:39:52,945
The only place I've seen in my life

1126
01:39:53,072 --> 01:39:56,282
where women have 3, 4 or 5 husbands

1127
01:39:56,867 --> 01:39:59,409
and many other women's husbands.

1128
01:40:00,704 --> 01:40:02,747
The woman has a husband hunter,

1129
01:40:03,248 --> 01:40:04,916
un fisherman husband,

1130
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:08,877
a husband who works a little agriculture

1131
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:13,256
a husband who is close to home and helps you do all ...

1132
01:40:13,469 --> 01:40:15,802
Women have tremendous power.

1133
01:40:15,929 --> 01:40:19,765
Have dominion over from men,

1134
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:21,515
bastante considerable.

1135
01:40:54,302 --> 01:40:58,515
Something that has always seemed very interesting to these peoples

1136
01:40:58,724 --> 01:41:02,519
It is that the people had a full awareness of their image.

1137
01:41:03,145 --> 01:41:05,148
When I was going to take a picture,

1138
01:41:05,774 --> 01:41:09,609
the person knew I was going to represent your image

1139
01:41:10,613 --> 01:41:13,822
At first they were somewhat interested, then let them be interested.

1140
01:41:15,408 --> 01:41:17,451
It was not his world.

1141
01:41:17,661 --> 01:41:21,038
However, I was very interested in my knife.

1142
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:25,960
YPO my friend made me swear I'd give my knife.

1143
01:41:26,086 --> 01:41:28,380
But the head of the FNI

1144
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:32,426
had made me promise not to give them anything,

1145
01:41:32,552 --> 01:41:35,805
to protect the purity of these Indians.

1146
01:41:36,431 --> 01:41:38,682
I said, "Look, we make a deal.

1147
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:43,520
The day that you go and strip the knife out the window of the plane.

1148
01:41:43,646 --> 01:41:46,192
I will follow the path of the plane

1149
01:41:46,318 --> 01:41:48,234
and I find the knife. "

1150
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:08,966
These plants are very old.

1151
01:42:09,175 --> 01:42:11,926
They are between 40 and 50 years.

1152
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:18,600
The wonderful plants ...

1153
01:42:19,643 --> 01:42:21,143
ferns.

1154
01:42:21,313 --> 01:42:25,565
A shade plant, which grows in the middle of the jungle,

1155
01:42:25,734 --> 01:42:27,984
in the highest parts, here.

1156
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:31,488
Hair reminds me of my mother.

1157
01:42:31,615 --> 01:42:34,242
My mother was a beautiful woman. Lot.

1158
01:42:37,078 --> 01:42:39,662
Those were your plants. When she died,

1159
01:42:40,792 --> 01:42:43,667
my father cared for him until he died.

1160
01:42:43,793 --> 01:42:46,128
After the we brought us.

1161
01:42:52,011 --> 01:42:53,721
Look, it's raining.

1162
01:42:54,096 --> 01:42:55,179
How pretty.

1163
01:43:13,534 --> 01:43:17,453
That land is very important to us.

1164
01:43:17,997 --> 01:43:21,332
We are closing a cycle with this land

1165
01:43:22,043 --> 01:43:25,713
and during that cycle she spent our lives.

1166
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,506
He spent the lives of my parents,

1167
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:30,573
step the life of my sisters,

1168
01:43:30,927 --> 01:43:33,845
and much of my life.

1169
01:43:34,097 --> 01:43:38,935
And now turn to add our lives to this.

1170
01:43:39,061 --> 01:43:40,813
My life and Leila again.

1171
01:43:42,064 --> 01:43:44,399
It remains our history.

1172
01:43:44,525 --> 01:43:48,362
It was part of my childhood and now it is my old age.

1173
01:43:48,573 --> 01:43:49,863
And the day I die,

1174
01:43:49,988 --> 01:43:55,618
We leave here the forest there was a bit before my time.

1175
01:43:56,206 --> 01:43:59,041
Therefore, you will complete a cycle.

1176
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:01,501
It's the story of my life.

1177
01:44:23,067 --> 01:44:26,027
The man whose photographs have told us

1178
01:44:26,153 --> 01:44:28,238
thousands of stories about our planet,

1179
01:44:28,364 --> 01:44:30,573
It leaves us a great history and a great dream:

1180
01:44:30,699 --> 01:44:32,783
the destruction of nature can be reversed.

1181
01:44:35,872 --> 01:44:40,667
More than a thousand fountains watering again "Terra Institute".

1182
01:44:40,793 --> 01:44:44,046
There are already planted 2.5 million trees.

1183
01:44:44,171 --> 01:44:46,715
The wildlife has returned, even jaguars.

1184
01:44:48,761 --> 01:44:52,055
The earth is no longer possession of Salgado,

1185
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:54,474
now a national park that belongs to everyone.

1186
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:58,604
Is the demonstration that devastated lands anywhere

1187
01:44:58,729 --> 01:45:00,939
they can return to forest.
