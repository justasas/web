1
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,767
A film about the life of a photographer?

2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,562
Maybe it's good at the beginning
to remember where the word comes from.

3
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,666
In Greek, "photo" meant "light."

4
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:10,587
"Graph" was "writing, drawing."

5
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:15,954
A photographer is literally
somebody drawing with light.

6
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:20,779
A man writing and rewriting the world
with light and shadows.

7
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:42,447
The Serra-Pelada, Brazil's gold mine...

8
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:43,948
there before me!

9
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,659
When I reached the edge
of that enormous hole...

10
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,881
every hair on my body stood on end.

11
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:56,911
I'd never seen anything like it.

12
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,241
Here, in a split second,
I saw unfolding before me...

13
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:04,233
the history of mankind...

14
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:07,335
The building of the pyramids...

15
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,138
the Tower of Babel...

16
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,021
the mines of King Solomon...

17
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,237
Not the sound of
a single machine could be heard.

18
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:17,924
All you could hear...

19
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,367
was the babble of
50,000 people in one huge hole.

20
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,045
Conversations, noises, human sounds...

21
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:30,886
mingled with the sounds of manual labor...

22
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:34,754
I had returned to the dawn of time.

23
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:40,275
I could almost hear the gold whispering
in the souls of these men.

24
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,918
All this earth had to be removed.

25
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,532
It's not all gold.

26
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:01,596
The guys had to climb small ladders...

27
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,900
leading to bigger ones...

28
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,551
to emerge at the top.

29
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:18,855
You wouldn't want to fall down there!

30
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,028
If you fell from the top
you'd risk taking others with you.

31
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:30,630
I'd climb up several times a day...

32
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,961
but I never thought I'd fall.

33
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,262
Nobody else fell.

34
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:39,902
You were there to carry sacks, not to fall.
And in my case, to take photos.

35
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:49,526
These guys climbed it
50 or 60 times a day.

36
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:56,082
The only way
to get down such a slope...

37
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:57,699
is by running.

38
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,463
If you stop, you fall.

39
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:13,342
All these men together
formed an extremely organized world...

40
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:15,794
but in complete madness.

41
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:31,939
You get the impression they're slaves...

42
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:34,277
but there wasn't a single slave.

43
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:38,505
They were only slaves
to the idea of getting rich.

44
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,876
Everybody wanted to get rich.

45
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,052
There were all sorts:
intellectuals, university graduates...

46
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,772
farm employees...

47
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,460
urban workers...

48
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:56,711
People from all walks of life
were trying their luck.

49
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:02,663
Because when you'd hit a vein of gold...

50
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,831
everyone working
that little section of the mine...

51
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,677
had the right to choose one sack.

52
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:13,855
And in that sack that they chose...

53
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,038
- and this is the slavery aspect-

54
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:20,029
there might be nothing
or a kilo of gold!

55
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,096
At that very moment
one's freedom was at stake.

56
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,771
Men who come into contact with gold...

57
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,379
can never leave it.

58
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:44,766
I first saw this picture here, in a gallery,

59
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:47,060
more than 20 years ago.

60
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,437
I had no idea who took it.

61
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,590
Whoever it was had to be both
a great photographer

62
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,352
and an adventurer, I thought.

63
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,960
There was a stamp on the back
and a signature,

64
00:05:58,027 --> 00:06:00,523
Sebastião Salgado.

65
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,820
I acquired the print.

66
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,933
The gallerist pulled other pictures,

67
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,654
by the same photographer, from a drawer.

68
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:11,418
What I saw profoundly moved me,

69
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:14,059
especially this image here,

70
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:17,055
a portrait of a blind Tuareg woman.

71
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:22,455
It still moves me to tears,
even if I see it every day,

72
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:26,020
as it's hanging over my desk ever since.

73
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:30,317
So one thing I knew already
about this Sebastião Salgado,

74
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:32,965
he really cared about people.

75
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,764
That meant a lot, in my book.

76
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:39,370
After all, people are the salt of the earth.

77
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:45,161
It took a while until we finally met and talked

78
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,118
about his life, his work,

79
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,728
and where it was all coming from.

80
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:27,342
If you put too many photographers
in one place...

81
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,292
they'll all take very different pictures.

82
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:34,743
Because they necessarily come...

83
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:38,619
from very diverse places.

84
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:42,333
Each one forms their way of seeing...

85
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:46,632
according to their history.

86
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,500
I feel that in my case...

87
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:55,253
I learned to shape my way of seeing
here, in this place.

88
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:59,173
Here I have an idea of the planet.

89
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:03,576
I'd go for long walks with my father...

90
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,423
across this farm.

91
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:07,639
We'd come here to look.

92
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,661
Behind each mountain there's a story,
there's something to see.

93
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,398
I'd dream a lot here.

94
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,842
I wanted to go beyond the mountains,
I wanted to know.

95
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:49,226
Sebastião was such a rascal!

96
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:51,565
He was always traveling...

97
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:53,671
like no one I'd ever seen.

98
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:57,705
My dad was the same, he never stopped.

99
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:00,497
Back and forth, like a shuttle.

100
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:02,607
Just like Sebastião.

101
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:05,908
You'd think he was in Vitória,
but he'd already be here...

102
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:09,315
or up north doing politics.

103
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:14,650
Without his fellow students
he wouldn't have finished his studies.

104
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,371
Tiao was a scamp
when it came to studying.

105
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:23,080
He was a handful, but he managed
to get his economics degree.

106
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:27,960
I wanted him to be a lawyer.

107
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,221
He did one year...

108
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:33,209
then switched to economics,
which was good for him.

109
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,116
That was Sebastião Salgado.

110
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,261
The father, that is.

111
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:43,523
He passed his name on to his only son, who,

112
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:47,478
even if he remained
a restless traveler for all his life,

113
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:51,538
did profit from
the studies his dad had obliged him to

114
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,751
in ways he could not have
anticipated himself.

115
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,402
His education as an economist

116
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:00,547
equipped him with a solid knowledge

117
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:03,773
of global markets, trade and industry,

118
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,340
so he knew what was driving the world.

119
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:10,253
For our man, it all started in the little town

120
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:13,471
of Aimorés, in central Brazil.

121
00:14:13,546 --> 00:14:17,187
There was his father's cattle farm
under the big sky.

122
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,958
There were vast Atlantic rain forests.

123
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,483
There was the river,
still navigable at the time.

124
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:27,316
But most of all, there were
the endless trains running by,

125
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:30,693
filled to the brim with minerals and iron ore,

126
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:33,724
that would go from here into the world.

127
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:39,279
After all, this was and still is
the biggest mining region on the planet.

128
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:42,136
This is where young Sebastião grew up,

129
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:44,405
the only boy among seven sisters,

130
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:45,560
what a life!

131
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:52,689
All summers long, he played on the banks
of the Rio Doce, the "Sweet River."

132
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:55,115
That's where you are now.

133
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:58,696
And here we are, our little documentary crew.

134
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:03,207
I learned one thing.

135
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:05,979
Having a photographer
in front of your camera

136
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:09,016
is very different from filming anybody else.

137
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:12,749
He would not just be there
and act like himself, so to speak.

138
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:16,957
No, by profession, he reacts and responds

139
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:21,230
using his weapon of choice,
his photo camera.

140
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:23,043
Our man shoots back.

141
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:27,242
- Wim, I have a nice shot of you.
- And I got one of you!

142
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,665
I bet you did!

143
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:31,672
In this case, he wasn't just shooting at me.

144
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,973
Look...

145
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:35,444
He had two of us in front of his lens.

146
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:39,261
The other guy, my fellow director,
was his oldest son, Juliano.

147
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,951
He had already accompanied his father
with his camera on several journeys,

148
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:47,884
like to Papua New Guinea,
which you just saw before,

149
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,114
or here, to a remote island

150
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:53,050
far north on the East Siberian Sea.

151
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,670
I wish I could have gone there, too.

152
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:07,227
Father and son Salgado
invited me to join them

153
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:09,648
and continue this film together,

154
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:12,383
to add an outside view
to their adventure, I guess.

155
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:15,192
I didn't hesitate a bit.

156
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:17,502
What else could I ask for?

157
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:21,132
I would finally get to know this man,

158
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,400
find out what was driving him,

159
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:26,670
and why his work had left
such an impression on me.

160
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:30,836
Little did I know that I was going to discover

161
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,951
much more than just a photographer.

162
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,848
Sebastião was 15 years old
when he took the train

163
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:44,310
to leave the little country town for good,

164
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:48,166
to go to high school
in the provincial capital of Vitória.

165
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,786
Our young man didn't know, at first,
what to do with the money in his pockets.

166
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:55,414
He had never paid for anything in cash.

167
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,066
At the farm, they had produced
everything themselves,

168
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,922
so he stayed hungry during
the first weeks in the big city,

169
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:04,341
afraid of going into a pub
and just ordering something to eat.

170
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,775
We are in the dark
what Sebastião would have become

171
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:14,126
if this young woman here
hadn't entered the picture.

172
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:15,560
Lélia.

173
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:19,367
She was 17, a music student,
and utterly beautiful.

174
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,562
It was love at first sight.

175
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,754
When Sebastião got a scholarship
for a master in economics

176
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,755
at a university in São Paulo,

177
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:29,218
they moved there and got married.

178
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,269
Where in the mid-'60s,

179
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,648
they were both involved in leftist politics,

180
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:39,777
like a lot of their fellow students
in Paris, Berlin or Chicago.

181
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,890
Brazil was under the reign
of a brutal military dictatorship,

182
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:45,936
so there was a daily danger
of being arrested,

183
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,131
deported and tortured.

184
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:52,204
In August of 1969,

185
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:55,135
Sebastião and Lélia left their home country

186
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,332
and took a boat to France.

187
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,145
While Sebastião continued
his formation as economist,

188
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,602
Lélia studied architecture.

189
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,381
One memorable day, she bought
a photo camera for her work,

190
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:11,462
and the one who had all the fun
with it was Sebastião.

191
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:16,044
The first picture he ever took
was of Lélia, of course.

192
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:20,471
And then Sebastião got a job
at the International Coffee Organization

193
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,359
and they moved to London.

194
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,629
Heading for a career at the World Bank,

195
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:28,829
he often traveled to Africa
to survey development projects.

196
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:30,900
He would take Lélia's camera with him,

197
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,602
and would always come back
with lots of pictures.

198
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,947
Realizing that these photographs

199
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:41,717
gave him so much more pleasure
than his economic reports,

200
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:45,108
the two of them made
a bold decision together.

201
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:47,077
He should take the enormous risk,

202
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:51,848
abandon a promising,
well-paid career as an economist,

203
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,772
and start from scratch.

204
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:57,666
They moved back to Paris
and invested all they had

205
00:18:57,774 --> 00:18:59,394
in expensive photo equipment.

206
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:03,785
For a while,
Sebastião tried his hand at sports,

207
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:07,055
did portraits, weddings and even nudes,

208
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,402
before he found his vocation.

209
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:16,488
These were
my first photographs.

210
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:19,422
We were in the city of Tahoua.

211
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:23,227
Young mothers were standing in line...

212
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:26,236
to get some food...

213
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:31,243
as there'd been a severe drought
in Niger in '73.

214
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,207
For Lélia it was tough,
because she was pregnant.

215
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:39,858
I remember, we were in that very place...

216
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,253
living at a friend's home at Niamey...

217
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:46,682
when the local Marabout came by.

218
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:50,609
Lélia was wearing shorts,
she was really pretty.

219
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:55,111
And the Marabout sat down...

220
00:19:55,182 --> 00:19:57,108
and said to her...

221
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:59,461
"Come sit on my lap!"

222
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:02,145
"Oh," I said...

223
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:06,021
"Mr. Marabout, there's a slight problem...

224
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:09,691
This woman is pregnant...

225
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,996
with our first child.

226
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:15,137
So it's best she stays put."

227
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:18,809
So he understood that...

228
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:24,331
it wasn't the right synchronicity.

229
00:20:24,402 --> 00:20:27,659
So we talked it over
and he left with a kilo of sugar...

230
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:30,313
as happy as if it'd been Lélia.

231
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:38,773
Their son Juliano was born in Paris in 1974.

232
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,645
Here he is, my future pal and co-director.

233
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:48,085
Lélia continued to support Sebastião
with all she could as a young mother.

234
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:50,040
She worked hard, parallel to her studies,

235
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,215
and presented Sebastião's
photographs everywhere,

236
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,134
to magazines, newspapers and agencies.

237
00:20:56,777 --> 00:21:00,732
And then,
after a few significant publications,

238
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,098
the two of them felt encouraged to envision

239
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:06,051
a first big photographic project on their own,

240
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:08,698
Otras Americas.

241
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,685
"The Other Americas."

242
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,436
It was going to take Sebastião
all across South America.

243
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:18,583
Little Juliano was getting used
to seeing his dad off

244
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,875
for long absences at a time.

245
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:31,683
Ever since we'd left Brazil in 1969...

246
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,865
I'd deeply missed South America.

247
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:38,390
So I decided to travel...

248
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:40,683
around Brazil's neighboring countries:

249
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,136
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia...

250
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:49,501
I dreamt of seeing the mountains
of South America...

251
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:50,845
the Andes.

252
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:53,793
At the time, in South America...

253
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:57,469
there was a profound social movement...

254
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,110
the "Liberation Theology".

255
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:05,931
And on this journey
I met a young priest, in Ecuador...

256
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,772
called Gabicho.

257
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:12,216
We were both young,
I a photographer, he a priest.

258
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,982
He brought them the word of God...

259
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:20,720
he organized the farmers into cooperatives,
introduced solidarity.

260
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:24,518
And since he had access
to all these communities...

261
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:27,809
those journeys I made were extraordinary.

262
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:34,715
There we were, over 3,000 meters up.

263
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,651
We'd climb 600 or 700 meters in a day.

264
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:44,477
It was a sheer delight
to live in this landscape...

265
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,129
among these communities.

266
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,479
These are the Saraguros,
a tribe of Indians in the south of Ecuador.

267
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:58,426
Very religious, but also great drinkers.

268
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:03,561
Over half of them, at the weekend,
men and women...

269
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:05,700
would get totally drunk.

270
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,649
The villager on the left...

271
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:14,022
his name is Lupe, Guadalupe...

272
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,620
Lupe and I became very close.

273
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:21,295
At the time I had very long hair...

274
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:23,210
long blond hair...

275
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:26,357
with a big, reddish blond beard.

276
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:31,334
Walking with him through the mountains...

277
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:34,894
one day he said to me, "Listen, Sebastião.

278
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:37,885
I know that you were sent from heaven."

279
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,684
According to the Saraguros' legends...

280
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,428
God, in the image of Christ...

281
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,800
was to return to Earth to observe them...

282
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:52,407
to decide who'd go to heaven.

283
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:57,927
As we walked in the mountains,
he told me about his life.

284
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:04,712
He seriously believed that I'd come
as a special observer...

285
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:08,384
to report "up there"
about their behavior.

286
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:17,043
Never in my life had I met a people...

287
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:20,449
with such a different sense of time.

288
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:27,043
The time I spent with the Saraguros
felt like an entire century...

289
00:24:27,114 --> 00:24:29,303
everything felt so slow.

290
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:33,207
It was another way of thinking,
a different rhythm.

291
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:38,463
There was a fatalism on their faces.

292
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:44,778
This is in the state of Oaxaca, in Mexico.

293
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:48,230
A group of farmers called the Mixe.

294
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,599
It's all medieval, the yoke, the plow...

295
00:24:57,277 --> 00:25:00,004
This is deepest South America.

296
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:04,302
They were a country people...

297
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:08,291
but what mattered most to them...

298
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:09,719
was music.

299
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:12,938
They were people who adored music.

300
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:18,921
Every member of the community
able to play an instrument...

301
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:21,795
didn't have to do any work...

302
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:23,914
they worked as musicians.

303
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:31,548
They had me sleep for several days...

304
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:35,459
in a very cold cement room...

305
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:39,526
to see if I could bear it,
if I really wanted to stay...

306
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:42,403
As I held out for quite a while...

307
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:45,401
they finally put me up in a house...

308
00:25:45,508 --> 00:25:48,356
and I grew much closer to the community.

309
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:50,006
It was a pleasure for me.

310
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:53,686
We became close friends,
I felt good there.

311
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,278
This is in the north of Mexico.
The Tarahumara.

312
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:10,111
These people are great runners,
long-distance runners.

313
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,915
They don't walk, they run.

314
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:15,286
God, it was hell trying to keep up.

315
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:18,016
They didn't walk, they flew!

316
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,762
That's a Tarahumara...

317
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:32,058
his face deeply marked by life.

318
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:37,848
Beautiful hair, fantastic hair.

319
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:43,448
People would approach my camera...

320
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:47,593
and I had the impression
I was more a sound recorder.

321
00:26:48,895 --> 00:26:53,085
They'd tell me things
as if I was recording their stories.

322
00:26:58,488 --> 00:27:03,289
The power of a portrait
lies in that fraction of a second...

323
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:08,126
when you catch a glimpse
of that person's life.

324
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:11,877
The eyes say a lot,
the expression on the face...

325
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:17,679
When you take a portrait,
the shot is not yours alone.

326
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:20,013
The person offers it to you.

327
00:27:24,464 --> 00:27:27,191
Those journeys meant so much to me.

328
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:34,219
To come here after all those years,
unable to set foot in my own country.

329
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:38,510
The essence was the same.
It was my continent, we were so close.

330
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:44,614
Otras Americas took Sebastião eight years.

331
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:47,641
On these journeys
into the deepest South America,

332
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:51,940
he simply disappeared
for extended periods of time.

333
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:55,932
Juliano largely grew up
with an absent father.

334
00:27:56,312 --> 00:27:59,618
His parents could at least
write letters back and forth.

335
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:03,802
This was, of course, long before
any satellite communication.

336
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,986
Whenever he came home in between,

337
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:10,744
to see his family and to edit
his photos together with Lélia,

338
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:14,307
Sebastião appeared
like a great adventurer to his son,

339
00:28:14,383 --> 00:28:17,995
some kind of superhero,
rather than a photographer.

340
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,343
And jump cut...

341
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,977
...to me, 30 years later.

342
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:27,549
I finally join my father
on one of his missions

343
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:31,615
to Wrangel, a deserted island
in the Arctic Ocean.

344
00:28:32,762 --> 00:28:37,683
Sebastião was hoping to photograph
the last big congregations of walruses.

345
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,634
I wanted to find out who that man was,

346
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:44,736
the man I had only known as my father.

347
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:50,457
I wanted to discover the photographer,

348
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:52,988
the adventurer, for the first time.

349
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:15,097
Goddamn bear!

350
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:16,634
He tricked us.

351
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:20,472
He drove them all into the water.
Incredible!

352
00:30:57,686 --> 00:30:59,344
What do you think?

353
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:02,183
What do you think, Dad?

354
00:31:02,252 --> 00:31:05,896
I think it'll be complicated
to get this story.

355
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,123
If this is all we've got...

356
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,766
It's not just a matter of getting close
to a bear and taking a picture.

357
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:34,377
If the framing is poor...

358
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:38,247
you'll just show the bear,
but it won't be a photo.

359
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:41,622
This spot is no good.

360
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,309
There's nothing in the background...

361
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:47,535
nothing to compose a well-framed picture.

362
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,087
No action, nothing.

363
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:22,830
Stunning!

364
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,206
All I could see
was the shape of their tusks.

365
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:29,506
Impossible to make out
the outline of their heads.

366
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:32,231
It was like being in Dante's Inferno...

367
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,379
with those tusks protruding...

368
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,679
All those shapes... Incredible!

369
00:35:56,972 --> 00:36:00,431
Dad, what happened in 1979?

370
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:07,414
In '79, Lélia was pregnant
with our second son.

371
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:09,640
We knew it was a boy.

372
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,591
When Rodrigo was born...

373
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:18,000
he had all the signs of Down's syndrome.

374
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:22,526
He was so cute with his slanted eyes...

375
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:26,410
I felt he was completely normal.

376
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:28,214
So did Lélia.

377
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:34,849
The doctor did a lot of tests.
It was three weeks before we knew.

378
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,993
On the day he called...

379
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:40,946
the tension was such...

380
00:36:41,021 --> 00:36:43,486
that when I heard the results, I cried.

381
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:45,550
I couldn't stop crying.

382
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,806
My baby brother was never going

383
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,915
to be able to go to school
or learn how to read and write

384
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,215
like I would.

385
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:02,095
Rodrigo would be isolated in a world
we would never be able to share.

386
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,198
This was very hard on my parents.

387
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,847
But then something happened.

388
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:12,145
Through his love,
Rodrigo developed a language of his own.

389
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:15,178
Slowly, as a family,

390
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:17,865
we learned to decipher
his emotional alphabet

391
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,550
and to communicate without words.

392
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:28,947
Sometime later, my mum, my brother and I
took an airplane to Brazil.

393
00:37:29,021 --> 00:37:31,672
The military dictatorship had crumbled.

394
00:37:31,746 --> 00:37:34,211
I was five, and I didn't really understand

395
00:37:34,278 --> 00:37:37,355
how important that long trip was going to be.

396
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:41,268
At some point,
a man opened one of the blinds,

397
00:37:41,338 --> 00:37:44,568
and direct sunlight poured into the airplane.

398
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:47,826
His voice echoed through the cabin,

399
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,940
"We're flying over Brazil."

400
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,392
My mum looked through the window
and went silent.

401
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:58,417
She was seeing her own country
for the first time, after so many years.

402
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:02,559
It was such a happy moment,
and yet, when she turned to me,

403
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,400
she was crying.

404
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:11,461
As for my father, he was in French Guiana
and was going to join us later.

405
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,024
It was December 31,
I'd returned to Brazil!

406
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:18,981
It was great to be home...

407
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,626
after ten and a half years abroad.

408
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:27,962
It was a shock.
Lélia's hometown wasn't the same.

409
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:32,183
Vitória had changed a lot.
Everything was different.

410
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:35,746
My region had changed a lot too.

411
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:41,128
When I left my parents,
they were young and strong.

412
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:45,461
Upon returning, I found an old man.
My father had aged a lot.

413
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:47,603
But at that time...

414
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,942
I wanted to explore Brazil more deeply.

415
00:38:51,478 --> 00:38:53,900
My sister lent me a car...

416
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:58,315
and I made a six-month journey
in the North-East of Brazil.

417
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,420
I didn't know the North-East.

418
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:03,681
I'd always dreamt of that part of Brazil.

419
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:28,201
These people were going to a funeral.

420
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:32,883
I stopped by the roadside
and went with them.

421
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:39,942
Infant mortality was very high
in the North-East of Brazil.

422
00:39:40,016 --> 00:39:42,820
These children died
before they were baptized.

423
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:48,542
They believe that children
who are not baptized...

424
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:52,183
don't have the right to go to heaven.

425
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:55,215
They stay in an in-between realm...

426
00:39:55,288 --> 00:39:56,750
called limbo.

427
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,967
If a child dies with its eyes closed
it's because it was baptized.

428
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:04,691
If its eyes are open...

429
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:08,102
they leave them open
so it can find its way.

430
00:40:08,216 --> 00:40:12,055
Otherwise it will wander for eternity.

431
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:24,902
Back then, there was a service
for renting coffins at the church.

432
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:27,282
You could rent a coffin cheaply.

433
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,885
It'd be used dozens of times.

434
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:41,046
There you can see
such a coffin rental service.

435
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:46,383
And yes, those are shoes.

436
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:50,792
They sold everything:
shoes, coffins, bananas, vegetables...

437
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:53,398
ice-cream, everything...

438
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:59,192
It's a region
where life and death are very close.

439
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:07,401
Here's a group saying prayers...

440
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:10,620
and learning about politics
at the same time.

441
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:14,988
In Brazil there was, and still is...

442
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:18,139
a big movement
called the "Landless Workers".

443
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:22,625
Many of them came from here...

444
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,877
from the North-East of Brazil.

445
00:41:32,551 --> 00:41:33,510
These people...

446
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:36,395
have a moral strength...

447
00:41:36,462 --> 00:41:39,232
a physical force...

448
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,062
even though they're frail and eat poorly.

449
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:47,739
Look how arid this region is.

450
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:52,346
It's like a piece of the Sahel in Brazil.

451
00:41:55,677 --> 00:41:57,596
Here, on the road...

452
00:41:57,671 --> 00:42:00,397
people are leaving, never to return.

453
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,810
Sometimes it's so dry,
so difficult here...

454
00:42:03,884 --> 00:42:06,534
that people migrate
to the southern cities.

455
00:42:06,606 --> 00:42:09,638
For them it's over,
they abandon the land.

456
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,751
For many years now...

457
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:42,011
we've been suffering
from a lack of rain.

458
00:42:51,593 --> 00:42:56,589
There were a lot of cattle here before...

459
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:58,802
but they're all gone now.

460
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,643
There have been severe droughts.

461
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:05,284
The pastures are gone,
it doesn't pay anymore.

462
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:08,051
Why has it gone, Grandfather?

463
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:10,313
Because of the drought.

464
00:43:12,494 --> 00:43:16,681
We replanted,
but there's not a blade of grass left.

465
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,709
It wasn't that long ago.

466
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,544
Your dad and I...

467
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,539
we spent more than 20,000.

468
00:43:24,997 --> 00:43:26,075
Where did it go?

469
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,946
This land was so plentiful.

470
00:43:30,595 --> 00:43:35,089
There were lots of birds...

471
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,269
canaries and ticoticos...

472
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,801
blackbirds...

473
00:43:42,178 --> 00:43:45,820
There used to be a great forest
on that hill...

474
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:49,465
and another forest over that hill.

475
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,193
There has been a lot of erosion.

476
00:43:53,262 --> 00:43:55,072
The hills are now barren.

477
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:57,605
When it rains...

478
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:01,204
there's nothing to hold back the water.

479
00:44:01,315 --> 00:44:03,234
It's a disaster.

480
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:06,072
I have no idea...

481
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:09,449
how to stop it.

482
00:44:17,537 --> 00:44:20,765
Grandpa, were you happy on this farm?

483
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:21,795
Sorry?

484
00:44:21,871 --> 00:44:24,335
Were you happy here?

485
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:27,820
Was I happy'?

486
00:44:27,892 --> 00:44:30,739
I was, because I was able
to provide an education...

487
00:44:30,807 --> 00:44:33,883
for my seven daughters...

488
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:36,219
and Sebastião.

489
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,406
I raised my children,
it was tough...

490
00:44:39,474 --> 00:44:40,978
but I'm happy I did it.

491
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:48,031
I earned 100,000 from the woods alone...

492
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:50,251
to put the children through school.

493
00:44:50,328 --> 00:44:52,018
They were all brought up well...

494
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:55,396
well fed, properly dressed...

495
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:02,953
Since I first came to Brazil,

496
00:45:03,022 --> 00:45:05,366
my grandfather's land
had always been this way,

497
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:08,205
burnt and dried out.

498
00:45:09,465 --> 00:45:14,034
When Sebastião came back to the farm
after his journeys through North-East Brazil,

499
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:18,555
the place was hardly the paradise
he had known as a child.

500
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:21,586
But he had something else on his mind,

501
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,736
the suffering he had witnessed changed him.

502
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,107
His role as a photographer
took on a whole new meaning.

503
00:45:29,216 --> 00:45:32,248
We understood the urgency he felt to leave.

504
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:36,158
I still missed him a lot.

505
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:39,458
But I understood.

506
00:45:50,386 --> 00:45:54,912
For his next project, which would take him
to the Sahel region of Africa,

507
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:58,598
Sebastião started to work
with Doctors Without Borders.

508
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:06,539
I worked in Ethiopia in 1984...

509
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:12,092
and continued across the Sahel
in '85 and '86.

510
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,856
I spent almost two years in that region...

511
00:46:15,966 --> 00:46:19,226
reporting on the famine.

512
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:24,556
There were refugee camps...

513
00:46:24,634 --> 00:46:27,633
the largest ever seen in human history.

514
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,964
And I really wanted to show that.

515
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:35,030
To show that a large part of humanity...

516
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:37,989
was suffering from great distress...

517
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:41,589
due to a problem of sharing...

518
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,388
and not just a natural disaster.

519
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:50,759
This was a Coptic region.

520
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:54,825
They are very strict Christians,
the Northern Ethiopians.

521
00:46:54,893 --> 00:46:57,466
They have great humility.

522
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:00,156
Even with a dying child...

523
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:02,835
they wouldn't get in front of others.

524
00:47:02,908 --> 00:47:04,215
They'd rather wait.

525
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,072
Look at the state of the people.

526
00:47:15,602 --> 00:47:18,372
At that stage, they've no strength left.

527
00:47:19,514 --> 00:47:22,851
They say people die of famine.

528
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:26,384
Famine weakens the body...

529
00:47:26,494 --> 00:47:29,264
but it's the parallel diseases that kill.

530
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:35,590
When you catch cholera,
the dehydration is so fast...

531
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:40,032
that you lose 12 liters of water
a day from diarrhea.

532
00:47:40,723 --> 00:47:42,686
You die in two or three days.

533
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:49,588
Such young faces...

534
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:54,150
aged from so much suffering.

535
00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:58,063
If you look at his forehead,
he's not an old man.

536
00:47:58,134 --> 00:48:01,133
What's old about him
is the emptiness in his eyes.

537
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:05,043
Look how young she is,
look at their baby!

538
00:48:05,612 --> 00:48:07,039
He's her husband.

539
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:13,744
Most deaths were at night...

540
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:15,165
from the cold.

541
00:48:18,613 --> 00:48:22,452
Dying here
was really a continuation of life.

542
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,291
The people were used to dying.

543
00:48:27,012 --> 00:48:29,389
A husband is washing his wife to bury her.

544
00:48:33,148 --> 00:48:36,910
In his mountain clothes, his goat skin...

545
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:42,438
A very young woman.

546
00:48:48,144 --> 00:48:50,107
In the Coptic ritual...

547
00:48:50,176 --> 00:48:54,058
the body has to be clean
when it comes before God.

548
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:57,120
You have to wash it all over...

549
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,072
even if there's very little water.

550
00:49:03,714 --> 00:49:07,204
With each dying person
a piece of everyone else dies.

551
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:18,680
A father is preparing his son for burial...

552
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,048
saying his last goodbye.

553
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,997
Family members usually prepare their dead.

554
00:49:34,894 --> 00:49:36,398
Knowing that a government...

555
00:49:36,466 --> 00:49:41,145
is withholding food from its people...

556
00:49:41,222 --> 00:49:44,101
as was the actual case here...

557
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:46,945
in this camp in Northern Ethiopia...

558
00:49:47,012 --> 00:49:51,232
That was brutal political dishonesty.

559
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:09,986
I returned to Ethiopia
at the end of 1984.

560
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:14,856
The guerillas knew the government
was about to drive these people out...

561
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,002
so they started evacuating people
towards Sudan.

562
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:21,301
They left from all over Tigray.

563
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:27,636
We were attacked by two helicopters.

564
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,347
Mi-24s.
Very fast combat helicopters.

565
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,838
They shot at the people with machine-guns.

566
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:37,560
I took a photo and then I ran.

567
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,701
There were many pregnant women...

568
00:50:43,772 --> 00:50:49,073
hoping that when they'd arrive
they'd find food and water.

569
00:50:49,141 --> 00:50:51,791
That they'd finally reach
the promised land.

570
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:58,045
I must have spent...

571
00:50:59,227 --> 00:51:01,070
at least two months there.

572
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:03,832
And when I arrived in Sudan...

573
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:07,135
I did a lot of work
on the arrival of these people.

574
00:51:11,424 --> 00:51:13,648
This man had come from Ethiopia.

575
00:51:13,724 --> 00:51:16,875
His camel had reached its limit.
Maybe it was dead.

576
00:51:16,946 --> 00:51:19,443
But the man was holding on and on...

577
00:51:19,516 --> 00:51:22,439
Yet when he reached the doctors,
his child was dead.

578
00:51:24,655 --> 00:51:26,236
After such a long march.

579
00:51:34,435 --> 00:51:37,511
Doctors Without Borders
had to give up this camp.

580
00:51:38,116 --> 00:51:40,842
Water is essential in these camps...

581
00:51:40,915 --> 00:51:42,681
and it had become a huge problem.

582
00:51:42,757 --> 00:51:45,833
So they had to move the camp
as fast as possible.

583
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:54,187
People were crammed into UN trucks...

584
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:57,489
to take them to a new camp...

585
00:51:57,598 --> 00:52:00,902
on a beautiful and fertile piece of land...

586
00:52:00,973 --> 00:52:03,437
on the banks of the Blue Nile.

587
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:07,724
I rode on this truck
for at least 300 or 400 kilometers.

588
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,209
These are two friends...

589
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:18,349
pretending it was
a normal Sunday afternoon...

590
00:52:18,423 --> 00:52:21,346
sitting under a tree, telling stories...

591
00:52:25,402 --> 00:52:30,233
There's lots of water by the Nile,
but that's where the people died...

592
00:52:30,925 --> 00:52:32,157
because“.

593
00:52:32,689 --> 00:52:34,652
There was nothing to eat.

594
00:52:34,723 --> 00:52:37,493
They were in the final stages
of their distress.

595
00:52:41,126 --> 00:52:45,238
They'd forgotten to bring food,
or hadn't been able to.

596
00:52:45,345 --> 00:52:48,071
The food distribution had gone wrong.

597
00:52:48,184 --> 00:52:50,331
These people had held on so long...

598
00:52:50,407 --> 00:52:53,133
but when they got there,
they could no more.

599
00:53:04,483 --> 00:53:06,140
I went to Mali.

600
00:53:07,282 --> 00:53:09,626
There was a severe drought there too.

601
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:14,380
The skin becomes like tree bark...

602
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:18,252
like a tree marked by the desert wind...

603
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:21,859
by sandstorm after sandstorm...

604
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:33,675
There were only women and kids.

605
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:36,362
The men had left to work in Libya...

606
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:41,305
or headed for the Ivory Coast,
looking for work...

607
00:53:41,414 --> 00:53:45,176
promising to return
and bring food for the family.

608
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,436
But very few came back.

609
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,485
They were all saved...

610
00:53:59,555 --> 00:54:02,358
because Doctors Without Borders
did great work.

611
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:05,615
They brought assistance
to this whole area.

612
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:11,565
This is a friend, Luc, a Belgian doctor.

613
00:54:12,517 --> 00:54:16,934
Measuring a kid, weighing him.

614
00:54:19,344 --> 00:54:22,834
In two or three weeks
these children completely recover.

615
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:25,331
They're marked by it, all their lives...

616
00:54:25,404 --> 00:54:29,134
having experienced
such deprivation while growing up.

617
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:36,909
This boy was alone...

618
00:54:36,986 --> 00:54:40,095
with his instrument,
his little guitar, in his hand...

619
00:54:40,169 --> 00:54:43,779
With his rag of a shirt
still hanging on him.

620
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,616
No trousers, nothing.

621
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,642
Look at his determination, his posture.

622
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:54,096
He knew where he was going.

623
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:58,049
Looking for other groups,
looking for a village...

624
00:54:59,344 --> 00:55:00,576
with his dog...

625
00:55:00,648 --> 00:55:03,069
A boy of eight or nine.

626
00:55:08,817 --> 00:55:14,609
Sebastião became very attached
to the people in the Sahel region of Africa.

627
00:55:14,685 --> 00:55:16,800
He returned over and over again.

628
00:55:18,213 --> 00:55:22,782
His photographs, the book and the exhibition
that Lelia edited and put together

629
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:27,773
called worldwide attention to these droughts
and their threats to millions of lives,

630
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,376
and opened questions.

631
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:32,176
What had caused these conditions
in the first place?

632
00:55:33,976 --> 00:55:38,470
Afterwards, Sebastião turned to a subject
that would take another six years

633
00:55:38,578 --> 00:55:42,614
and countless journeys
to almost 30 countries all over the globe.

634
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:46,641
Workers, the third huge volume
of photographs

635
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:48,976
he and Lélia conceived together.

636
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:52,460
I wanted to pay homage...

637
00:55:53,036 --> 00:55:56,952
to all the men and women
who built the world around us.

638
00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:59,977
An archeology of the industrial era.

639
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,936
Sebastião and Lelia did extended research

640
00:56:04,004 --> 00:56:06,654
and planned Workers meticulously.

641
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:11,024
And then he traveled again,
to the four corners of the world,

642
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:14,556
photographing steelworkers
in the Soviet Union,

643
00:56:14,628 --> 00:56:17,354
living with ship breakers in Bangladesh,

644
00:56:17,427 --> 00:56:21,114
going to sea with fishermen
in Galicia and Sicily,

645
00:56:21,186 --> 00:56:24,109
showing the mechanical production
of cars in Calcutta,

646
00:56:24,178 --> 00:56:29,664
observing tea pickers in Rwanda,
a country he had first gone as an economist.

647
00:56:29,738 --> 00:56:33,730
He came on a different mission now,
with a changed view,

648
00:56:33,841 --> 00:56:36,065
but he was still the same man,

649
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,633
driven by the same empathy
for the human condition.

650
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,782
Each of these chapters of Workers

651
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:45,658
meant that Sebastião
would immerse completely

652
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:48,457
in that particular field of manual labor.

653
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:52,945
Like the weeks he spent
with the gold diggers at the Serra-Pelada.

654
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:58,161
In 1991, at the end of the first Gulf War,

655
00:56:58,233 --> 00:57:01,384
if you remember, the Iraqi troops withdrew

656
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:05,337
and Saddam Hussein set fire
to hundreds of oil wells.

657
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:07,978
An army of firefighters
from all over the world

658
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:10,472
moved to the burning oil fields.

659
00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:13,653
Sebastião just had to go as well,

660
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,878
driven by a curiosity
for this explosive profession.

661
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:29,225
As soon as I saw the first images on

662
00:57:29,872 --> 00:57:32,216
I felt the urge to cover this story.

663
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,392
It was like working in a huge theater.

664
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,456
500 oil wells burning.

665
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:43,610
A giant stage, the size of the planet.

666
00:57:45,252 --> 00:57:48,251
No restrictions,
you could go where you wanted.

667
00:57:50,697 --> 00:57:54,689
There was a discharge
of heavy oil smoke.

668
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:59,329
The smoke was so dense,
the sun couldn't cut through.

669
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:06,345
There were days
when it was dark for 24 hours straight.

670
00:58:12,749 --> 00:58:14,439
Once a fire was put out...

671
00:58:14,513 --> 00:58:17,360
the earth was still very hot.

672
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:21,388
They had to pour a huge amount
of water on to cool it.

673
00:58:21,494 --> 00:58:25,530
If not, the oil would just re-ignite.

674
00:58:27,476 --> 00:58:29,013
But despite that...

675
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:32,271
there'd sometimes be an explosion,
like a cannon shot.

676
00:58:34,187 --> 00:58:36,334
The noise was so deafening...

677
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:39,329
it was like working next to a jet engine.

678
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:42,818
Now I'm a little deaf.

679
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:45,235
That's where my deafness began.

680
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,844
These are Canadians...

681
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:05,214
a unit of firefighters from Calgary.

682
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:09,475
They'd brought a beautiful red truck.

683
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:12,884
And it was their rule,
once they'd put out a fire...

684
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:16,031
to wash the truck every evening.

685
00:59:16,105 --> 00:59:19,333
And in the morning
it'd be covered in oil again.

686
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:26,808
A hellish job!

687
00:59:30,027 --> 00:59:33,287
I put off my departure
at least 2 or 3 times...

688
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:35,587
until I really had to leave.

689
00:59:35,664 --> 00:59:38,815
But it broke my heart...

690
00:59:38,886 --> 00:59:42,419
to abandon this vast spectacle.

691
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:46,252
I roamed around.

692
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:48,976
And very close to the end...

693
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:52,811
we were driving by this long wall...

694
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:56,572
- That day I was with a journalist
from The New York Times -

695
00:59:56,643 --> 01:00:01,442
Since it was a no-man's-land,
ruined by war...

696
01:00:01,513 --> 01:00:03,356
we broke down the gate.

697
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:04,783
And inside...

698
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,005
we found a sort of...

699
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,532
paradise...

700
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,602
that had turned into hell.

701
01:00:12,252 --> 01:00:16,091
It was a garden
belonging to the Kuwaiti royal family...

702
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:20,384
with horses, thoroughbreds...

703
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:23,916
that had gone completely,
desperately insane.

704
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,633
Animals are the first
to flee from a catastrophe...

705
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:30,700
when they're free to leave.

706
01:00:31,466 --> 01:00:33,232
But here, they weren't.

707
01:00:34,649 --> 01:00:37,497
There were birds there too,
it was an oasis...

708
01:00:37,565 --> 01:00:39,637
very well irrigated.

709
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:44,899
Birds who couldn't fly anymore
as their feathers were stuck together.

710
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:51,604
The Kuwaitis fled
when they felt the disaster approaching...

711
01:00:52,412 --> 01:00:55,368
leaving behind the imprisoned animals...

712
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,934
and the Bedouins
whom they didn't really consider as humans.

713
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:04,881
Workers finally united the economist
in Sebastião Salgado

714
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:07,608
and the artist he had become.

715
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,790
The pictures appeared
in most of the great magazines,

716
01:01:10,866 --> 01:01:12,982
the exhibition traveled all over the world,

717
01:01:13,052 --> 01:01:15,277
and the book came out in many languages.

718
01:01:16,888 --> 01:01:19,615
But Sebastião and Lélia wouldn't rest.

719
01:01:20,495 --> 01:01:25,220
They immediately started to work
on another major phase of his photography.

720
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:29,173
They realized that one of
the burning subjects of our times

721
01:01:29,241 --> 01:01:32,351
was the displacement of entire populations

722
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:35,884
by wars, famines
or the rules of the global marketplace.

723
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:40,637
So while Europe was starting
to close its borders,

724
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:44,749
Sebastião was trying to shine a light
on the fates of the outcast.

725
01:01:46,237 --> 01:01:50,536
Again, he and Lelia
did all the research and planning together,

726
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:52,651
and again, she was the driving force

727
01:01:52,721 --> 01:01:56,943
behind this new chapter in their lives,
which they called “Exodus?

728
01:01:59,435 --> 01:02:03,548
It created a worldwide awareness
for the fate of all these refugees

729
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:05,765
in India, Vietnam, the Philippines,

730
01:02:05,842 --> 01:02:09,530
South America, Palestine, Iraq
and many other places.

731
01:02:10,484 --> 01:02:12,600
But Sebastião, over and over,

732
01:02:12,671 --> 01:02:17,199
returned to the continent that had
caught his imagination for so long already,

733
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:19,891
to Africa.

734
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:33,198
I was doing my project
on the displacement of peoples...

735
01:02:33,273 --> 01:02:35,192
in 1994...

736
01:02:35,766 --> 01:02:38,952
when the president of Rwanda...

737
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:41,407
his plane was shot down.

738
01:02:42,173 --> 01:02:45,326
That started a huge exodus
towards Tanzania...

739
01:02:45,396 --> 01:02:49,389
due to the brutal repression
of the Tutsis in Rwanda.

740
01:02:51,803 --> 01:02:54,651
I was one of the first to arrive there.

741
01:02:55,486 --> 01:02:57,788
The catastrophe was everywhere.

742
01:02:57,865 --> 01:03:00,287
People were fleeing to Burundi...

743
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:02,660
to the Congo, to Uganda...

744
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,885
They were leaving in all directions.

745
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:12,299
The roads were already full of people...

746
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:17,622
People sleeping by the roadsides...

747
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,388
carrying all their belongings on bicycles...

748
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:24,301
fleeing with whatever they could take.

749
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:28,719
We headed in the opposite direction...

750
01:03:28,787 --> 01:03:31,897
towards the border.

751
01:03:31,971 --> 01:03:34,665
There was no border control whatsoever.

752
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:38,376
I entered Rwanda, and it was terrifying.

753
01:03:38,992 --> 01:03:42,603
The number of dead bodies
I saw on that road...

754
01:03:45,706 --> 01:03:47,625
Here, a grenade had exploded.

755
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:51,805
Those not killed by the grenade
were killed with machetes.

756
01:03:53,378 --> 01:03:56,759
There, I began to sense...

757
01:03:56,831 --> 01:04:00,245
the sheer scale of the disaster
I was witnessing.

758
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:03,507
A genocide was in progress here.

759
01:04:06,806 --> 01:04:11,531
It was 150 kilometers by road to Kigali...

760
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:13,980
150 kilometers of dead bodies...

761
01:04:22,343 --> 01:04:25,573
I turned back,
because my story was about people.

762
01:04:25,681 --> 01:04:29,674
I was doing my book on refugees,
I was working on Exodus.

763
01:04:29,748 --> 01:04:32,366
I started going into the camps...

764
01:04:32,434 --> 01:04:34,016
and I began to see...

765
01:04:34,122 --> 01:04:37,733
the sheer number of people
leaving Rwanda.

766
01:04:39,608 --> 01:04:42,564
Hell was taking the place of paradise.

767
01:04:43,789 --> 01:04:45,937
It was frightening...

768
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:49,506
to see, on such a beautiful savanna...

769
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:52,583
this mega city springing up.

770
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:58,330
Within days,
there were almost a million people here.

771
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:09,118
Among all this distress,
one thing that really moved me...

772
01:05:09,226 --> 01:05:12,488
was the relationship
between this mother and her child...

773
01:05:12,564 --> 01:05:16,098
and the child's trust in its mother.

774
01:05:28,945 --> 01:05:30,483
Violence...

775
01:05:31,132 --> 01:05:32,747
and brutality...

776
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,082
are not the monopoly...

777
01:05:36,158 --> 01:05:38,121
of remote countries.

778
01:05:38,191 --> 01:05:41,301
It happened right here, in Europe,
in ex-Yugoslavia.

779
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,447
It was very shocking.

780
01:05:45,864 --> 01:05:49,704
A bus coming from Krajina
through Croatia...

781
01:05:50,852 --> 01:05:53,197
a person was killed through that hole.

782
01:05:53,268 --> 01:05:57,108
The Croats killed lots of people too
as they left Krajina.

783
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,567
Violence was everywhere.

784
01:05:59,637 --> 01:06:02,942
But what disgusted me most...

785
01:06:03,013 --> 01:06:06,701
was to see how contagious hatred was.

786
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:10,191
These people too saw violence.

787
01:06:10,264 --> 01:06:11,540
Entire families...

788
01:06:11,645 --> 01:06:14,950
the whole Serbian population
of Krajina was expelled.

789
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:20,325
And overnight, they found themselves...

790
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:24,310
evicted from their homes,
looking for a place to go...

791
01:06:24,382 --> 01:06:27,796
having their next-door neighbors
shooting at them.

792
01:06:42,989 --> 01:06:45,760
These were refugee camps
not far from Tuzla...

793
01:06:46,404 --> 01:06:49,328
in central Bosnia.

794
01:06:49,396 --> 01:06:52,352
These families had left
the enclave of Zepa...

795
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:56,234
where Serbs
murdered thousands of young men.

796
01:06:57,185 --> 01:07:01,713
We were there at the very moment
when the families were arriving...

797
01:07:02,709 --> 01:07:05,251
in a state of great distress.

798
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,716
There were only women, old men...

799
01:07:19,628 --> 01:07:20,817
and children.

800
01:07:20,932 --> 01:07:24,892
The younger men
had all been held and murdered.

801
01:07:31,061 --> 01:07:33,985
It was strange
that this was happening in Europe...

802
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:36,939
at the end of the 20th century.

803
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:38,891
From the cars alone...

804
01:07:38,963 --> 01:07:42,770
you can see these people
had a standard of living...

805
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:45,031
a European standard of living...

806
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:47,873
a European intellectual level...

807
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:50,166
a European infrastructure.

808
01:07:50,243 --> 01:07:52,053
And they lost everything.

809
01:07:55,959 --> 01:07:59,690
Hundreds of kilometers,
crowded with people and cars.

810
01:08:03,786 --> 01:08:05,476
We are a ferocious animal.

811
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:08,277
We humans are terrible animals.

812
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:13,344
Here in Europe, in Africa,
in South America, everywhere...

813
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:15,995
we are extremely violent.

814
01:08:22,623 --> 01:08:24,739
Our history is a history of wars.

815
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:33,176
It's an endless story...

816
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,290
a story of repression...

817
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,975
a tale of madness.

818
01:08:45,565 --> 01:08:48,336
The situation in Rwanda kept changing.

819
01:08:48,404 --> 01:08:52,364
The Hutu army, which was ruling
the country, was defeated...

820
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:57,234
and retreated into the Congo,
to the Goma region.

821
01:08:58,571 --> 01:09:02,946
First, the Tutsis had fled
the Hutu barbarity.

822
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:04,902
And then, the Hutus...

823
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:07,443
fled the Tutsi occupation.

824
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:09,549
So everybody fled, in turn.

825
01:09:12,612 --> 01:09:14,422
In just a few days...

826
01:09:14,492 --> 01:09:17,372
in July 1994...

827
01:09:17,446 --> 01:09:18,754
the Goma region...

828
01:09:18,828 --> 01:09:21,708
received more than 2 million people.

829
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:25,737
It was a disaster in the making.

830
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:31,415
Diseases such as cholera
started spreading...

831
01:09:31,488 --> 01:09:35,525
and the people began to die like ants.

832
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:38,516
12 to 15 thousand died every day.

833
01:09:42,537 --> 01:09:45,308
I was taking photos
of these piles of corpses...

834
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:48,754
when I saw the dad coming with his kid.

835
01:09:48,828 --> 01:09:50,290
He threw him on the pile...

836
01:09:50,363 --> 01:09:54,552
and left with his friend,
chatting as if nothing had happened.

837
01:10:00,952 --> 01:10:03,985
They couldn't bury all the people.

838
01:10:04,942 --> 01:10:07,898
So a bulldozer came from the French army...

839
01:10:07,973 --> 01:10:11,736
which took dozens at a time...

840
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:13,805
laid them out on the ground...

841
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:16,499
and covered them with earth.

842
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,834
Everybody should see these images...

843
01:10:35,902 --> 01:10:38,706
to see how terrible our species is.

844
01:10:45,071 --> 01:10:48,257
Orphan kids, who were on the road.

845
01:10:50,135 --> 01:10:51,520
Three children...

846
01:10:51,631 --> 01:10:55,089
the two with the livelier eyes
would live.

847
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:59,001
The one whose eyes are clouded was dying.

848
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:04,448
When I got out of there, I was ill...

849
01:11:04,522 --> 01:11:06,987
my body was very sick.

850
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:10,622
I didn't have any infectious diseases...

851
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,585
but my soul was sick.

852
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:21,177
I went back to Rwanda
one year after the disaster...

853
01:11:21,249 --> 01:11:26,278
to cover the return of the Hutus
who'd been in the Congo...

854
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:27,895
and had nowhere to go.

855
01:11:27,963 --> 01:11:32,305
The United Nations
started forcing them to return.

856
01:11:42,849 --> 01:11:46,842
You felt the whole planet
was covered with refugee tents.

857
01:11:59,499 --> 01:12:01,495
After working there...

858
01:12:01,571 --> 01:12:05,990
the Tutsi authorities
suggested that I should see...

859
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:09,822
a few of the places
where the massacres had occurred.

860
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:20,946
People had fled to a church,
believing they'd be safe.

861
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:24,015
All murdered!

862
01:12:30,382 --> 01:12:32,760
Here, it happened in a school.

863
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:37,486
You can still see what was written
on the blackboard that day.

864
01:12:37,595 --> 01:12:39,558
It was terrifying.

865
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:57,011
The people who had left Rwanda,
about 2 million refugees...

866
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:59,659
some went back to Rwanda...

867
01:12:59,732 --> 01:13:02,350
but others were afraid of the repression.

868
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:07,338
So a column of about 250,000 people
left the city of Goma...

869
01:13:07,405 --> 01:13:09,597
and entered the Congo forest.

870
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:13,817
We lost track of them.

871
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,729
Everybody knew
there were 250,000 lost people.

872
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,683
Nobody knew where they were.

873
01:13:22,214 --> 01:13:24,100
Six months later...

874
01:13:24,631 --> 01:13:29,082
they started appearing near Kisangani,
in the center of the Congo.

875
01:13:31,382 --> 01:13:34,916
They'd lived in the forest for 6 months.

876
01:13:35,987 --> 01:13:40,940
So the UN took me there.

877
01:13:42,164 --> 01:13:45,120
There was a train and I took it.

878
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,460
It was dropping off food,
then heading back.

879
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:51,372
But I said, "I'm staying."

880
01:13:56,780 --> 01:14:01,613
I spent three days with these people,
who kept arriving.

881
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,194
Columns and columns of them...

882
01:14:06,563 --> 01:14:09,825
To think that when they left
they were 250,000...

883
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:12,825
and only 40,000 made it here!

884
01:14:12,893 --> 01:14:16,461
210,000 people were missing!

885
01:14:26,244 --> 01:14:28,709
Yet at the same time, life went on.

886
01:14:28,777 --> 01:14:32,814
A guy cutting hair...

887
01:14:33,994 --> 01:14:36,372
Or even this Congolese guy...

888
01:14:36,488 --> 01:14:38,222
with his calculator...

889
01:14:39,173 --> 01:14:42,129
who was trying to collect...

890
01:14:42,242 --> 01:14:46,082
the few dollars
he was sure people had on them...

891
01:14:46,156 --> 01:14:49,799
which he was trying to exchange,
in the middle of nowhere!

892
01:14:49,878 --> 01:14:52,802
In the middle of a remote forest.

893
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:00,773
At that time...

894
01:15:01,425 --> 01:15:05,800
the pro-Tutsi guerilla movement
that had seized Kisangani...

895
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:08,449
began to expel these people again...

896
01:15:08,523 --> 01:15:09,985
to send them back.

897
01:15:10,058 --> 01:15:14,324
Six months to get there,
and now back to Rwanda!

898
01:15:14,392 --> 01:15:16,508
They began to kill some of them.

899
01:15:17,462 --> 01:15:21,608
There, I met people
who just couldn't take any more.

900
01:15:22,449 --> 01:15:25,143
Who started to be delirious...

901
01:15:25,249 --> 01:15:27,135
losing their minds...

902
01:15:27,206 --> 01:15:28,668
They were driven mad.

903
01:15:33,766 --> 01:15:37,257
In fact, those people who were expelled...

904
01:15:37,411 --> 01:15:39,680
were never heard from again.

905
01:15:40,979 --> 01:15:43,357
I believe they were all murdered.

906
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:55,950
That was my last trip,
that disastrous time in Rwanda.

907
01:15:59,395 --> 01:16:01,314
When I left there...

908
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:07,490
I no longer believed in anything,
in any salvation for the human species.

909
01:16:07,566 --> 01:16:10,184
You couldn't survive such a thing.

910
01:16:10,252 --> 01:16:11,986
We didn't deserve to live.

911
01:16:12,093 --> 01:16:13,936
No one deserved to live.

912
01:16:23,718 --> 01:16:28,476
How many times did I lay my cameras down
to cry over what I'd seen?

913
01:16:34,575 --> 01:16:38,066
Sebastião had seen
into the heart of darkness

914
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,411
and deeply questioned his work
as a social photographer

915
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:45,021
and a witness of the human condition.

916
01:16:45,778 --> 01:16:49,116
What was left for him to do after Rwanda?

917
01:16:56,712 --> 01:17:00,475
In that time,
my grandfather's health had worsened.

918
01:17:01,737 --> 01:17:05,468
My parents had to return to Brazil
to take care of the farm.

919
01:17:06,226 --> 01:17:08,724
It was nothing but a wasteland.

920
01:17:08,797 --> 01:17:11,219
They didn't know what to do with it.

921
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:15,973
The birds, the alligators
and the majestic forests were gone.

922
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:19,930
There was nothing left
from Sebastião's childhood memories.

923
01:17:23,567 --> 01:17:26,872
And then Lélia came up
with a surprising idea.

924
01:17:26,982 --> 01:17:31,095
"Why don't we replant the forest
that was here before?"

925
01:17:33,427 --> 01:17:37,998
The forest that was there before
and had once spread over all these hills

926
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:41,757
was Mata Atlântica, the Atlantic rain forest.

927
01:17:42,903 --> 01:17:45,401
Nobody had ever tried to replant it,

928
01:17:45,473 --> 01:17:48,703
let alone on a scale of 600 hectares.

929
01:17:49,578 --> 01:17:52,916
Lélia's suggestion was probably
driven by the impulse

930
01:17:52,993 --> 01:17:55,295
of lifting up the family spirit.

931
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:58,142
Yet, they actually started doing it.

932
01:17:58,901 --> 01:18:01,246
And in the following 10 years,

933
01:18:01,318 --> 01:18:05,660
nothing else than a full-blown miracle
took place on this land

934
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:08,960
that has since then become
the lnstituto Terra.

935
01:18:15,321 --> 01:18:18,431
I remember, during the first plantation...

936
01:18:18,582 --> 01:18:22,345
I sometimes dreamt
that everything had died.

937
01:18:23,876 --> 01:18:27,945
Because the soil was so bad here,
so damaged...

938
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,944
that I asked myself, "Will it ever grow?"

939
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:35,619
The Mata Atlântica
has 400 different species.

940
01:18:35,693 --> 01:18:38,497
Of course,
we don't have all 400 of them...

941
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,795
but each time, we plant...

942
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:41,908
it's 100 species...

943
01:18:41,984 --> 01:18:43,292
150 species...

944
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:47,325
After the first planting we lost 60%.

945
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:51,042
After the second, we lost 40%.

946
01:18:51,116 --> 01:18:54,302
We had no book to teach us how to replant...

947
01:18:54,377 --> 01:18:55,882
a Mata Atlântica.

948
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:16,092
I love coming up here...

949
01:19:16,743 --> 01:19:19,470
to see all these trees together...

950
01:19:19,543 --> 01:19:21,768
this mass of green forest.

951
01:19:22,728 --> 01:19:26,765
You can imagine
what it took to plant all these trees.

952
01:19:30,401 --> 01:19:32,244
When I was a kid...

953
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,785
we had a little waterfall.

954
01:19:35,695 --> 01:19:38,543
All year long, it cascaded down there.

955
01:19:38,611 --> 01:19:42,910
My sisters and I would walk here
to the waterfall, for picnics.

956
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,714
There was still an enormous forest.

957
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:47,786
Later...

958
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:51,655
the forest was cut down
and the water vanished.

959
01:19:52,691 --> 01:19:55,921
Our forest is still young,
it needs a lot of water.

960
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:01,982
But in 10, 15 years,
when this growth has stabilized...

961
01:20:02,052 --> 01:20:05,936
I'm sure we'll have
a beautiful waterfall once more.

962
01:20:27,068 --> 01:20:28,181
You can see...

963
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:31,256
lots of little paths...

964
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:33,476
hundreds of them...

965
01:20:34,358 --> 01:20:36,169
That's where the cows walk.

966
01:20:36,968 --> 01:20:41,234
Each cow's hoof,
as it touches the ground...

967
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:44,609
presses down with 200 or 250 kilos
on one small space.

968
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,019
The soil flattens, it dries out...

969
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:50,090
and nothing grows on it anymore.

970
01:20:50,166 --> 01:20:53,166
It's interesting to see the difference...

971
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:58,345
between what the lnstituto Terra
was before, meadows like that...

972
01:20:58,416 --> 01:21:01,875
and what it is today,
a completely rebuilt eco-system...

973
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:04,017
with our 2 million trees.

974
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:26,512
Here you can see...

975
01:21:26,578 --> 01:21:30,615
a cicada that sang until it died.

976
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:35,134
I'm sure its body
wasn't enclosed in the tree like that.

977
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:38,819
The termites have built around it,
assimilated it.

978
01:21:38,933 --> 01:21:40,853
It'll be buried in there.

979
01:21:49,714 --> 01:21:54,285
You look at a tree and you think only
of its verticality, its beauty...

980
01:21:54,357 --> 01:21:59,464
But everything depends on the tree,
our water, our oxygen...

981
01:21:59,575 --> 01:22:01,571
It's everyone's home.

982
01:22:01,647 --> 01:22:04,724
Ants, small insects, cicadas...

983
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,299
they're all in there.

984
01:22:07,403 --> 01:22:11,931
It feels good to hold
a tree you've helped to plant.

985
01:22:12,007 --> 01:22:15,499
It's already deeply rooted,
firm in the ground...

986
01:22:15,575 --> 01:22:18,914
Thirty years from now, it'll be like this.

987
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:21,870
It's still quite young, still growing.

988
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:26,052
These are even younger ones, tiny ones.

989
01:22:26,127 --> 01:22:28,014
Maybe they sprouted last night...

990
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,966
like Alice entering Wonderland.

991
01:22:32,035 --> 01:22:37,339
It's incredible that they'll become trees
40 meters or so high...

992
01:22:37,408 --> 01:22:40,212
and will live for 400 or 500 years.

993
01:22:40,976 --> 01:22:42,558
What power!

994
01:22:47,153 --> 01:22:51,342
To think that these three-month-old trees...

995
01:22:51,411 --> 01:22:53,789
will reach their apex in 400 years.

996
01:22:54,942 --> 01:22:59,393
Perhaps from there we could try to grasp...

997
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,655
the concept of eternity.

998
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:03,958
Maybe eternity is measurable.

999
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:09,602
When I first said, "Let's plant a forest"...

1000
01:23:09,675 --> 01:23:14,508
I thought that from a seed
I'd grow a small tree, a small plant...

1001
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:17,658
Well, this isn't one small plant,
it's a million!

1002
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:20,614
And it's not only for here.

1003
01:23:20,688 --> 01:23:24,377
It's for the whole region,
and further each time.

1004
01:23:24,486 --> 01:23:27,639
What's wonderful is that an idea...

1005
01:23:29,627 --> 01:23:31,775
can develop and grow.

1006
01:23:31,891 --> 01:23:35,153
And it's no longer one person's idea,
it's everyone's.

1007
01:23:36,764 --> 01:23:40,376
Our technology
can be reproduced almost everywhere.

1008
01:23:40,447 --> 01:23:42,716
Of course, species differ.

1009
01:23:42,788 --> 01:23:45,406
But the know-how is the same...

1010
01:23:45,972 --> 01:23:47,816
for every tropical forest.

1011
01:24:00,476 --> 01:24:03,782
The land healed Sebastião's despair.

1012
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:06,546
The joy of seeing the trees grow again,

1013
01:24:06,615 --> 01:24:08,611
the springs coming back to life,

1014
01:24:08,687 --> 01:24:14,099
it all jump-started Sebastião's calling
as a photographer once more.

1015
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,672
Only that he and Lelia knew
they couldn't possibly

1016
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:19,396
return to what they'd done before.

1017
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:21,126
We came to the conclusion...

1018
01:24:21,195 --> 01:24:24,884
that I could do a new project
related to the environment.

1019
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:28,070
Of course, I first thought...

1020
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,867
of denouncing
the destruction of the forests...

1021
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,438
or the pollution of the oceans...

1022
01:24:33,511 --> 01:24:34,470
whatever.

1023
01:24:34,548 --> 01:24:38,160
Then we thought
we'd do a different sort of project.

1024
01:24:38,845 --> 01:24:41,037
We'd pay a tribute to the planet.

1025
01:24:41,108 --> 01:24:43,726
And we were very surprised to discover...

1026
01:24:43,794 --> 01:24:46,674
that almost half of the planet is still...

1027
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:49,127
like at the time of creation.

1028
01:24:51,736 --> 01:24:56,078
Many of my friends said,
"No, you shouldn't take that route.

1029
01:24:56,226 --> 01:24:59,718
"It's risky. You're known
as a social photographer...

1030
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:03,483
"And you're venturing into the field...

1031
01:25:03,554 --> 01:25:07,362
"of landscape, or wildlife photography."

1032
01:25:07,429 --> 01:25:09,731
I said, "I don't care, let's do it!

1033
01:25:09,808 --> 01:25:13,223
"L have to learn
to photograph that as well."

1034
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,264
And I started my first story.

1035
01:25:15,372 --> 01:25:18,252
I wanted it to be Galapagos.

1036
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:22,472
I wanted to understand
what Darwin had understood.

1037
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:25,426
The same species...

1038
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:28,611
in very different ecosystems...

1039
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:31,026
will evolve very differently.

1040
01:25:33,367 --> 01:25:36,400
Looking at this detail of an iguana's paw...

1041
01:25:36,475 --> 01:25:39,781
I can't help thinking...

1042
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:42,884
of the hand of a medieval knight...

1043
01:25:42,959 --> 01:25:46,451
with those metallic scales to protect him.

1044
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,594
Looking at the paw's bone structure...

1045
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:55,128
I see that the iguana is also my cousin.

1046
01:25:55,813 --> 01:25:58,431
That we came from the same cell.

1047
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:05,639
When you're in front
of a creature of that age...

1048
01:26:05,712 --> 01:26:07,632
you're facing a real authority...

1049
01:26:07,707 --> 01:26:10,281
with all those wrinkles,
all that knowledge.

1050
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:12,626
When Darwin came here...

1051
01:26:12,694 --> 01:26:16,883
that turtle
would already have been an adult.

1052
01:26:16,953 --> 01:26:19,069
Maybe it saw Darwin.
Who knows?

1053
01:26:21,251 --> 01:26:23,869
One day I was very tired...

1054
01:26:23,937 --> 01:26:29,120
as we'd been walking a long time
across some lava fields.

1055
01:26:29,193 --> 01:26:31,113
I lay down on the beach to rest...

1056
01:26:31,995 --> 01:26:34,951
and I felt something touch my leg.

1057
01:26:35,025 --> 01:26:37,949
I looked and it was a sea lion.

1058
01:26:38,019 --> 01:26:39,939
Another one came up beside us.

1059
01:26:40,014 --> 01:26:42,283
We were three sea lions!

1060
01:26:42,968 --> 01:26:46,776
They didn't see man as a predator,
nor as a threat.

1061
01:26:49,068 --> 01:26:51,948
That was my first nature report...

1062
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,100
the first time
I photographed other animals.

1063
01:26:58,507 --> 01:27:02,151
For eight years,
I took my time observing.

1064
01:27:03,726 --> 01:27:05,766
The main thing was to understand...

1065
01:27:05,874 --> 01:27:09,682
that I'm as much a part of nature
as a turtle, or a tree...

1066
01:27:09,749 --> 01:27:11,177
or a pebble.

1067
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:26,987
Amazing how he looks at us...

1068
01:28:27,062 --> 01:28:28,753
Indeed“.

1069
01:28:30,016 --> 01:28:32,056
There's depth in there!

1070
01:28:32,127 --> 01:28:35,007
He was coming closer,
I was photographing him...

1071
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:36,544
his hand in his mouth...

1072
01:28:37,077 --> 01:28:40,569
He was seeing himself in a mirror
for the first time...

1073
01:28:40,645 --> 01:28:42,260
the front of the lens.

1074
01:28:42,371 --> 01:28:45,219
He was taking his finger out,
putting it back...

1075
01:28:45,288 --> 01:28:46,903
realizing that it was him.

1076
01:28:46,976 --> 01:28:51,974
He was becoming aware of his image,
and I sensed total identification.

1077
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:08,079
They are families like ours...

1078
01:29:08,155 --> 01:29:11,079
with grandfathers, fathers,
grandchildren.

1079
01:29:13,566 --> 01:29:16,828
They respect each other.

1080
01:29:16,904 --> 01:29:21,432
And when you visit them,
you have to be polite...

1081
01:29:21,547 --> 01:29:24,045
to stand in a certain way...

1082
01:29:24,117 --> 01:29:26,811
you have to respect their territory.

1083
01:29:26,879 --> 01:29:29,181
And then you're welcomed.

1084
01:29:30,793 --> 01:29:34,175
I also befriended a whale.

1085
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:40,275
These are whales...

1086
01:29:41,804 --> 01:29:43,112
in Argentina.

1087
01:29:45,641 --> 01:29:49,100
An adult like this is 35 meters long,
weighs about 40 tons.

1088
01:29:50,246 --> 01:29:52,515
She came so close to the boat...

1089
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,697
I could touch her.

1090
01:29:54,774 --> 01:29:57,392
And it was incredible.
Such sensitive skin!

1091
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,998
As I was caressing her...

1092
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:03,337
I could see her tail, 35 meters away,
trembling.

1093
01:30:03,407 --> 01:30:04,945
Incredible sensitivity.

1094
01:30:05,556 --> 01:30:09,700
We had a small boat, just 7 meters long.

1095
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:12,813
She knew she could have sunk us.

1096
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,606
But she never once hit the boat. Not once!

1097
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,677
As we left,
she began tapping her tail...

1098
01:31:00,701 --> 01:31:02,925
That's like another planet!

1099
01:31:03,002 --> 01:31:05,226
It's quite incredible.

1100
01:31:05,302 --> 01:31:09,796
Let me see if I have another photo
of the Nenets.

1101
01:31:11,016 --> 01:31:14,778
See, everything a Nenet owns is here.

1102
01:31:16,155 --> 01:31:17,430
That's their house.

1103
01:31:21,792 --> 01:31:25,359
I'd been planning this work
on the Nenets for a long time.

1104
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:30,423
About eighteen people,
with six thousand reindeer...

1105
01:31:30,497 --> 01:31:32,568
constantly migrating.

1106
01:31:34,678 --> 01:31:37,632
This must be
about seven in the evening.

1107
01:31:37,707 --> 01:31:40,705
At about eight in the evening
they'd light a fire...

1108
01:31:40,775 --> 01:31:43,425
and cook the only hot meal of the day.

1109
01:31:44,303 --> 01:31:47,607
After the meal, we'd chat a bit.
Everybody talked.

1110
01:31:47,678 --> 01:31:49,139
They'd put out the fire.

1111
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:54,970
While the fire was burning,
it was 15 to 20 degrees, quite nice.

1112
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:57,500
Two hours later, it was minus thirty.

1113
01:32:00,602 --> 01:32:03,862
They're the real cowboys of Siberia.

1114
01:32:03,938 --> 01:32:06,555
They always have their lasso...

1115
01:32:06,622 --> 01:32:09,620
made of reindeer skin,
around their necks.

1116
01:32:10,495 --> 01:32:15,141
They have boots made of silver-fox skin.

1117
01:32:15,941 --> 01:32:19,278
They sleep with them.
Those boots last a lifetime.

1118
01:32:33,926 --> 01:32:37,110
The Ob is a very special river...

1119
01:32:37,186 --> 01:32:38,952
a huge Siberian river.

1120
01:32:39,909 --> 01:32:43,399
At this spot,
it's about 47 kilometers wide.

1121
01:32:46,314 --> 01:32:50,272
Once past the Ob,
you're in the Arctic Circle.

1122
01:32:52,219 --> 01:32:54,716
There's no horizon, there's nothing.

1123
01:32:54,788 --> 01:32:59,128
You are on a white plate,
as wide as the universe.

1124
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:12,546
Genesis took Sebastião

1125
01:33:12,621 --> 01:33:16,460
around the globe once more
for almost a decade.

1126
01:33:16,532 --> 01:33:21,101
It was gonna show us nature,
animals, places and peoples

1127
01:33:21,172 --> 01:33:23,975
that were like at the beginning of time.

1128
01:33:24,048 --> 01:33:25,891
A much more optimistic view

1129
01:33:25,966 --> 01:33:29,117
of the same planet
than Sebastião had witnessed for so long

1130
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:31,149
as damaged and destroyed.

1131
01:33:32,869 --> 01:33:37,820
Genesis was gonna be their opus magnus,
a love letter to the planet.

1132
01:33:50,624 --> 01:33:55,925
There were accounts of the Zo'é
in 16th-century Jesuit writings.

1133
01:33:55,993 --> 01:33:59,330
They went to Amazonia
and spoke about these people...

1134
01:33:59,406 --> 01:34:02,360
who wore a tube of wood
inside their lower lip.

1135
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:05,620
These Indians were never seen again.

1136
01:34:05,695 --> 01:34:08,039
It was believed to be a fairytale...

1137
01:34:08,111 --> 01:34:10,379
or an invention by the Jesuits...

1138
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:12,827
until the end of the eighties...

1139
01:34:12,943 --> 01:34:15,484
when these Indians
were contacted again.

1140
01:35:41,452 --> 01:35:43,720
These Indians really live in a paradise.

1141
01:35:44,827 --> 01:35:47,051
It's the only place I've found...

1142
01:35:47,127 --> 01:35:50,158
where the women
have 3 or 4 or 5 husbands...

1143
01:35:50,733 --> 01:35:53,197
and the husbands have as many wives.

1144
01:35:54,414 --> 01:35:56,333
Each woman has a hunting husband...

1145
01:35:56,983 --> 01:35:58,869
a fishing husband...

1146
01:35:58,939 --> 01:36:01,862
a farming husband...

1147
01:36:02,468 --> 01:36:06,579
one who's a handyman,
who helps around the house...

1148
01:36:06,724 --> 01:36:08,992
The women have enormous power.

1149
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:12,750
They have an influence over
some of the men...

1150
01:36:12,821 --> 01:36:14,402
that's quite considerable.

1151
01:36:45,801 --> 01:36:49,988
One thing I always found interesting
about all these peoples...

1152
01:36:50,058 --> 01:36:53,625
was their perfect consciousness
of their appearance.

1153
01:36:54,276 --> 01:36:56,577
When I was about to take a photo...

1154
01:36:56,654 --> 01:37:00,493
they'd know I was going to make
a representation of their image.

1155
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:04,632
At first they'd be eager,
then, they'd lose interest.

1156
01:37:06,049 --> 01:37:08,164
It wasn't their world.

1157
01:37:08,235 --> 01:37:11,615
On the other hand,
they were very interested in my knife.

1158
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:16,219
My friend Ypô made me swear
to give him my knife.

1159
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:18,862
But the National Indian Foundation...

1160
01:37:18,935 --> 01:37:22,392
made me promise not to give
any of my objects to the Indians...

1161
01:37:22,462 --> 01:37:25,570
to protect their purity.

1162
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:28,522
So he said, "Let's make a deal.

1163
01:37:28,637 --> 01:37:30,523
"They day you leave...

1164
01:37:30,592 --> 01:37:33,133
"throw your knife
out of the airplane window.

1165
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,577
"I'll follow the plane's path...

1166
01:37:35,655 --> 01:37:37,465
"and I'll find your knife!"

1167
01:37:55,059 --> 01:37:57,480
These plants are very old.

1168
01:37:57,552 --> 01:38:00,168
They've been here for 40 or 50 years.

1169
01:38:04,452 --> 01:38:06,567
They're wonderful plants...

1170
01:38:07,634 --> 01:38:09,094
samambaia.

1171
01:38:09,168 --> 01:38:13,278
A plant of the shade,
from the heart of our forest...

1172
01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:15,493
from the highest parts.

1173
01:38:16,835 --> 01:38:18,982
It reminds me of my mother's hair.

1174
01:38:19,058 --> 01:38:21,707
My mother was very beautiful.

1175
01:38:24,272 --> 01:38:26,888
These were her plants,
and after she died...

1176
01:38:27,914 --> 01:38:30,716
Dad took care of them
until he passed away.

1177
01:38:30,789 --> 01:38:32,598
Then, we brought them here.

1178
01:38:38,571 --> 01:38:40,489
Look, it's raining.

1179
01:38:40,564 --> 01:38:41,796
Beautiful rain.

1180
01:38:59,311 --> 01:39:02,647
This land is extremely important to us.

1181
01:39:03,489 --> 01:39:06,639
We're completing a cycle with this land.

1182
01:39:07,361 --> 01:39:10,927
Within this cycle,
we have spent our lives.

1183
01:39:11,003 --> 01:39:12,768
The lives of my parents...

1184
01:39:12,843 --> 01:39:15,840
the lives of my sisters...

1185
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:18,482
a large part of my life...

1186
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:23,884
And today,
we're living our lives here again...

1187
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,496
Lélia and I.

1188
01:39:26,528 --> 01:39:28,795
This land continues to tell our story.

1189
01:39:28,867 --> 01:39:32,747
It formed my childhood
and accompanies my old age.

1190
01:39:32,816 --> 01:39:35,356
And when I die...

1191
01:39:35,422 --> 01:39:39,989
this forest will once again be
like when I was born.

1192
01:39:40,061 --> 01:39:42,524
And the cycle will be complete.

1193
01:39:43,167 --> 01:39:45,162
It's the story of my life.

1176
01:40:05,921 --> 01:40:08,758
The man whose photographs have told us

1177
01:40:08,879 --> 01:40:10,878
thousands of stories about our planet,

1178
01:40:10,999 --> 01:40:13,116
It leaves us a great history and a great dream:

1179
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:15,237
the destruction of nature can be reversed.

1180
01:40:18,197 --> 01:40:22,794
More than a thousand fountains watering again "Terra Institute".

1181
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:26,034
There are already planted 2.5 million trees.

1182
01:40:26,155 --> 01:40:28,592
The wildlife has returned, even jaguars.

1183
01:40:30,554 --> 01:40:33,712
The earth is no longer possession of Salgado,

1184
01:40:33,833 --> 01:40:36,030
now a national park that belongs to everyone.

1185
01:40:36,153 --> 01:40:39,990
Is the demonstration that devastated lands anywhere

1186
01:40:40,113 --> 01:40:42,230
they can return to forest.
