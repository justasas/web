1
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:08,058
It may be best to start recalling the origin of this word.

2
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,350
In Greek, "photo" meaning light.

3
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:14,475
And "graphein" was writing, drawing.

4
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:18,933
A photographer is literally someone drawing with light.

5
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:23,975
Someone who writes and rewrites the world with light and shadow.

6
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:46,601
Sierra Pelada, la pray Mine Brazil,

7
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,268
in front of me.

8
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:54,059
When I reached the edge of that huge hole

9
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:57,393
I raised the hair.

10
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,684
I had never seen anything like it.

11
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:07,185
There, I saw before me in a split second,

12
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,184
the history of mankind.

13
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:12,185
The history of the construction of the pyramids,

14
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:14,351
the Tower of Babel,

15
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:16,352
King Solomon's Mines.

16
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,811
The sound of a single machine in there was no sound.

17
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,560
Only you could hear

18
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,270
the murmur of 50,000 people in a big hole.

19
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:34,060
Conversations, noise, human noise

20
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,102
mixed with touches manuals ...

21
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:41,103
Actually, I have traveled to the beginning of time there.

22
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:46,853
I could almost hear the murmur of gold in those souls.

23
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,061
We had to throw all that land.

24
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,854
Not everything is gold,

25
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,062
They had to climb, get out, climb the small stairs

26
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,396
then get to the big stairs,

27
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:13,146
and come to the surface.

28
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:27,104
You're not thinking of falling.

29
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:33,481
And if you fall, there is a risk you take several.

30
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,272
I up several times a day

31
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:41,731
and it never occurred to me that I might fall

32
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:44,188
because no one fell.

33
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:48,981
We were there to carry bags or to take pictures, in my case.

34
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:59,064
The men went up there 50 or 60 times a day.

35
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:05,774
The only way down an inclined plane like that

36
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,398
He is running.

37
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:10,315
Si paras, te caes.

38
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,940
All these people together formed a very organized world.

39
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,441
But completely crazy.

40
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:43,150
They may look like slaves,

41
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:45,691
but there was not a single slave.

42
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:49,941
If there was slavery there, it was the desire to be rich.

43
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:52,608
Everyone wanted to be rich.

44
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:59,942
There you could find everything: intellectuals, lawyers,

45
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,984
Farm employees,

46
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,566
City workers ...

47
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:09,110
They all came to look for an opportunity.

48
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,277
Because when we gave a gold mine,

49
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:20,485
everyone working in that part of the mine

50
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:23,610
They had the right to choose a bag.

51
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:27,068
And in those sacks they had chosen

52
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,110
slavery was hiding.

53
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:33,318
It could be nothing or could be a kilo of gold.

54
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:37,610
At that time they played their independence.

55
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:43,403
All men, when they begin to touch the gold,

56
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,153
They do not return.

57
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,153
I saw this picture for the first time in a gallery,

58
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,486
more than twenty years ago.

59
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,818
I did not know who had taken.

60
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:09,569
I thought, "He must be a great photographer and an adventurer."

61
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,819
Behind it was a stamp and a signature.

62
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:15,278
Sebastião Salgado.

63
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:17,820
I bought a copy.

64
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,904
The gallery drawer pulled more photos of the same photographer.

65
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:27,029
What I saw moved me deeply,

66
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:29,612
especially this image,

67
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:33,196
portrait of a blind woman Tuareg.

68
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:38,488
Even though tears cause I see every day,

69
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:41,780
So since then, it hangs on my desk.

70
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:46,655
I knew something of Sebastião Salgado.

71
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,155
Really they cared about people.

72
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:51,947
This meant a lot to me.

73
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:56,447
At the end of the day, people are the salt of the earth.

74
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,781
It was a long time before we met

75
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:06,406
and we talked about his life, his work and where it came from everything.

76
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:17,322
The salt of the earth

77
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:45,824
We can put many photographers in one place,

78
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,823
always will draw very different pictures

79
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:52,990
because necessarily come

80
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:57,866
very very different sites.

81
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,533
Everyone has their way of seeing,

82
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,866
each according to his story.

83
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:08,992
I think my story

84
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:15,034
It is that I learned my way to see here in this place.

85
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:18,699
Here I have an ideal world.

86
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:23,575
Took long walks with my father,

87
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:27,700
through this place, and we came here to watch.

88
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,950
Behind each of these mountains,

89
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:37,159
there is a story, there is something to see.

90
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:47,285
Here I dreamed a lot.

91
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:52,160
He wanted to go beyond these mountains, he wanted to know.

92
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:05,535
A JOURNEY WITH Sebastiao Salgado

93
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:44,662
MOUNTAINS OF WEST PAPUA, INDONESIA, Village Yali, 2011

94
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:23,879
Sebastião was very bohemian, was always traveling.

95
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:26,392
He liked to travel as anyone.

96
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:27,671
My father was like that.

97
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,922
It was not anywhere. It was like a shuttle.

98
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:35,629
That was Tiao.

99
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:38,380
I thought I was in Vitoria, and was here.

100
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:43,004
O he was in the north, or making political propaganda.

101
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:44,755
And as for studies,

102
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,087
if I had not had friends, he would have studied.

103
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:54,880
Sebastião was left for studies. He gave a lot of work.

104
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:57,047
But he studied economics.

105
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:00,923
I wanted to do law.

106
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,964
He studied one year, but did not like

107
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:07,713
and he switched to economics, and did well.

108
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,506
This was Sebastião Salgado,

109
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,797
Father.

110
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,048
He bequeathed his name to his only son,

111
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:22,256
who, though he remained all his life a restless traveler,

112
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:26,548
He benefited from studies that his father forced him to take

113
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,548
in ways that would never have imagined.

114
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:35,757
His studies in Economics endowed him sound knowledge

115
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:39,173
markets, trade and industry.

116
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,256
So I knew what ruled the world.

117
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,925
For him, all started in Aimorés, a small town in Brazil.

118
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:53,216
There the estate of his father stood under the big sky.

119
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:56,050
There were vast Atlantic forests.

120
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:59,466
The river then was still navigable.

121
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,675
But above all, endless trains were passing by

122
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:07,301
bursting with minerals, iron ore

123
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:10,133
going from there to the rest of the world.

124
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:15,425
At the end of the day, this was and still is the largest mining area in the world.

125
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:21,467
That's where Sebastião grew. He was the only child among seven sisters.

126
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:22,926
What a life!

127
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:25,634
Every summer,

128
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,467
He played on the banks of the Rio Doce, the "sweet river".

129
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,676
That's where we are.

130
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:34,134
So here we are,

131
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,592
our small crew.

132
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:38,342
Sebastian, ¿te ahí falls?

133
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:40,551
I learned one thing.

134
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:44,010
Having a photographer in front of my camera

135
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:47,093
It is very different from shooting anyone else.

136
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:50,842
Not standing still doing himself.

137
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:56,052
No. For professional bias, react and respond

138
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:59,302
using his weapon, his camera.

139
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:01,636
Returns the shot.

140
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:05,886
- Wim, I have a very nice picture of you. - I will not say it.

141
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:07,385
I can imagine!

142
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:10,719
In this case, it was not just me ... fotografiándome

143
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:11,678
Look at the picture.

144
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:14,553
Two of us had on target.

145
00:16:14,678 --> 00:16:18,344
The other, my fellow director, was his eldest son, Julian.

146
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:23,344
He had already accompanied his father with his camera on several trips,

147
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,387
as Papua New Guinea, who have already seen.

148
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:32,804
Or here, to a remote island north of the East Siberian Sea.

149
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,428
I wish I could join them.

150
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:49,929
Father and son Salgado invited me to continue this documentary with them,

151
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:52,679
I guess to add an external view of your adventure.

152
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,638
I did not hesitate for a second.

153
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,220
What more could you ask for?

154
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:01,845
At last I could get to know this man,

155
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:04,263
discover what motivated him

156
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:08,138
and why his work had impressed me so much.

157
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:13,305
I did not know I was going to discover

158
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,555
much more than a photographer.

159
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:22,306
Sebastião was 15

160
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:25,931
when he took the train and went to the small town forever

161
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:29,556
to attend school in the provincial capital of Vitoria.

162
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:34,389
So young, at first did not know what to do with money in their pockets.

163
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:37,389
I had never paid any money.

164
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,223
On the farm, which produced all of them.

165
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:43,181
So, at first, starved,

166
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:46,681
dreading going to a store to order something to eat.

167
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,431
Ignorant of what had become of Sebastião

168
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:56,890
He had not appeared this girl in your life.

169
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:58,265
Lelia.

170
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:02,390
I was 17, I was studying music and incredibly beautiful.

171
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,639
It was love at first sight.

172
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,640
When Sebastião won a scholarship

173
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,015
to study for a Master in Economics from the University of Sao Paulo

174
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,683
they moved there and married.

175
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:16,724
It was the 60,

176
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,474
both they involved in left-wing movements,

177
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,348
as other students in Paris, Berlin or Chicago.

178
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:27,308
Brazil was under the rule of a brutal military dictatorship,

179
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:31,765
thus, the risk of being arrested, deported and tortured was constant.

180
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:36,266
In August 1969,

181
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:39,434
Sebastian y su Lelia if marcharon of homeland

182
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,600
and they took a boat to France.

183
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,642
Sebastião while continuing his training as an economist,

184
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:49,309
Lélia studying architecture.

185
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:53,184
A memorable day, she bought a camera for their work.

186
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,642
And we really had fun with her was Sebastião.

187
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,671
The first photograph was taken Lélia, of course.

188
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:05,934
Sebastião entered the International Coffee Organization

189
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,393
and they moved to London.

190
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:09,935
With the idea of ​​a career in the World Bank,

191
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:14,393
often he traveled to Africa to study development projects.

192
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,435
Lélia's camera was taking

193
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:20,226
and always he returned with many pictures.

194
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,810
Realizing that those pictures

195
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:27,685
They met him much more than economic reports,

196
00:19:27,936 --> 00:19:31,060
both took a bold decision.

197
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:33,269
He had to take the enormous risk

198
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:38,269
to abandon his promising career as an economist

199
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:40,436
to start from scratch.

200
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:46,019
They returned to Paris and spent all photographic equipment cost.

201
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:50,727
For a time, Sebastião tried photographing sports,

202
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:54,145
made portraits, weddings and even naked,

203
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:56,770
before finding his calling.

204
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,853
Those are my first photos.

205
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:07,062
We were in Tahoua.

206
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:10,437
Two young mothers queuing

207
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:13,854
to receive food.

208
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,104
It was a time of great drought in Niger, 1973.

209
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:24,229
For Lelia was more difficult because she was pregnant.

210
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:27,729
I remember once we were there,

211
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:31,979
in a friend's house in Niamey.

212
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,021
Then came the marabout of Niamey.

213
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:39,521
Lélia was wearing shorts, she was gorgeous.

214
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:43,771
And the marabout came, sat down,

215
00:20:43,898 --> 00:20:45,854
and said Lelia.

216
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:48,355
"Come out, sit on my lap."

217
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,314
"Oh," I said,

218
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,398
"Marabout sir, there is a small problem,

219
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:59,230
this woman is pregnant

220
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:01,564
our first child.

221
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,855
You better stay here. "

222
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:08,856
He understood the need ...

223
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:14,355
the lack of synchronization at that time.

224
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,940
And finally, we talked so much that it was a kilo of sugar,

225
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,773
as happy as if he had gone with Lelia.

226
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:30,190
His son Julian was born in Paris in 1974.

227
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:33,648
There's my future colleague and co-director.

228
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:39,149
Lélia continued to support Sebastião around as a young mother.

229
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,399
He worked hard in their studies

230
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:44,649
and to present the work of Sebastião everywhere.

231
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,982
In magazines, newspapers and agencies.

232
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,107
And so,

233
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,232
after some relevant publications,

234
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:58,233
both they found the courage to conceive her first major photographic project.

235
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:02,776
"Other Americas".

236
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,650
It would take Sebastião throughout South America.

237
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:09,775
The small Juliano got used

238
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:13,483
the long absences of her father.

239
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,401
OTHER AMERICAS

240
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:24,734
After leaving Brazil in 1969,

241
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,859
I started to really miss Latin America.

242
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:31,733
And I decided to make a trip

243
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,110
to neighboring Brazil.

244
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:38,110
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia ...

245
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:43,234
Also it sounded to see mountains of Latin America.

246
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,943
The Andes.

247
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:51,319
At that time, Latin America, there was a profound social upheaval.

248
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:54,401
Theology of Liberation.

249
00:22:55,653 --> 00:23:00,319
On that trip I met a young priest in Ecuador,

250
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,360
Gabicho named.

251
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:06,944
We fear the same age, a young photographer and a young priest.

252
00:23:07,195 --> 00:23:09,903
He was the one who carried the word of God,

253
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:15,860
farmers organized into cooperatives, introducing solidarity.

254
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,779
And when he had all these communities to reach,

255
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:23,236
I could make impressive trips.

256
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:30,486
Here we were more than 3,000 meters.

257
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:35,903
Sometimes we climbed slopes of 600 to 700 meters per day.

258
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:40,529
But I greatly enjoyed living in this landscape,

259
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:42,445
in those communities.

260
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:50,029
These are the Saraguros, a group of Indians in southern Ecuador.

261
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:55,155
Very religious, but also heavy drinkers of alcohol.

262
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:00,487
More than half of the community, on weekends, men and women

263
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:02,904
They are completely drunk.

264
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:07,988
The farmer left

265
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,238
It called Lupe, Guadalupe.

266
00:24:11,614 --> 00:24:15,405
Lupe was my friend.

267
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:19,030
At that time, I had very long hair,

268
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:21,031
blonde and very long.

269
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:24,363
And he had a big beard, redhead and blonde.

270
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,489
One day we were walking through the mountains,

271
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:33,238
He approached me and told me. "Look, Sebastião,

272
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:36,281
I know that you have sent from heaven. "

273
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:40,281
Because according to legend Saraguros

274
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:44,156
the gods, to the image of Christ,

275
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:48,781
They return to Earth to see them, to observe

276
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:51,489
and see who deserved heaven.

277
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:57,365
While touring the mountains, he took the opportunity to tell his life.

278
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,239
He firmly believed that I was there to observe them.

279
00:25:04,365 --> 00:25:08,282
And up there counting their behavior.

280
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:17,157
I had never seen before, an entire people

281
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:20,950
another rhythm of time.

282
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:27,575
The time I spent with Saraguros seemed a hundred years.

283
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,075
Everything was so slow.

284
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:34,575
It was another way of thinking, another speed.

285
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,616
There were fatalism in their faces.

286
00:25:43,202 --> 00:25:46,117
This is in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico,

287
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:49,866
is a group of peasants called mixes.

288
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:56,409
There, everything is medieval, the plow, all ...

289
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,034
It was the profound Latin America.

290
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:06,534
He was a peasant village,

291
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:11,951
but more important was the music that community.

292
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:15,535
It was a people who loved music.

293
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:21,785
All members of the community who could play an instrument

294
00:26:22,036 --> 00:26:24,285
They did not need to work.

295
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:26,910
They worked as musicians.

296
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:34,577
They let me sleep a few days

297
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:38,868
in a cement room, very cold,

298
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:43,118
to see if reluctant, if you really wanted to stay.

299
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:46,119
As I managed to resist,

300
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:49,244
I was taken from there and took me to a house.

301
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,286
I went more to the community.

302
00:26:52,495 --> 00:26:53,995
And for me it was a pleasure.

303
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:57,912
We became friends and coexisted in harmony in the community.

304
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:09,911
This is in northern Mexico, are the Tarahumara.

305
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:14,870
They are great runners are runners.

306
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,912
They walk away.

307
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:20,370
My God, it was hell follow these aborigines

308
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:23,454
they were not walking, flying!

309
00:27:31,872 --> 00:27:33,371
This is a Tarahumara,

310
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:38,121
with his face well marked, well lived.

311
00:27:40,998 --> 00:27:44,371
With her beautiful hair, great hair.

312
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,747
Several times they came to my camera

313
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:54,331
and they made me feel a sound technician.

314
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:59,996
They told me things like I was recording them.

315
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:10,414
The strength of a portrait is that in that split second

316
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:15,414
We understand a little the life of the person photographed.

317
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,415
The eyes speak volumes, the expression of the face.

318
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:25,373
When you do a portrait, is not you alone who takes the picture.

319
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:27,873
The person offers photo.

320
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:35,332
Those trips were very important to me.

321
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:42,540
To return after years without stepping on my country, to be here.

322
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,541
The essence was the same, it was my continent, we were very close.

323
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:53,416
"Other Americas" led him to Sebastião eight years.

324
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:56,750
On this trip to South America deeper

325
00:28:56,875 --> 00:29:01,000
he simply disappeared for long periods.

326
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:05,250
Julian grew up with a father who was almost always absent.

327
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:09,209
His parents could at least correspond.

328
00:29:09,335 --> 00:29:13,459
Clearly this occurred before the current media.

329
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:17,834
Each time he returned home to see his family

330
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,625
and edit your photos with Lelia.

331
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:24,460
Sebastião seemed like a great adventurer to his son.

332
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:28,460
A superhero, rather than a photographer.

333
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:29,584
i And cut!

334
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:34,209
I am, thirty years later.

335
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:37,919
Finally, I joined my father in one of his missions.

336
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:39,709
A Wrangel,

337
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:42,918
a desert island in the Arctic Ocean.

338
00:29:43,836 --> 00:29:45,751
Sebastião hoped to photograph

339
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,668
the last great gathering of walruses.

340
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:52,876
I wanted to find out who the man was,

341
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:56,710
the man he had only known as father.

342
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:04,795
I wanted to find the photographer, adventurer, for the first time.

343
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,131
Cursed Bear!

344
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:31,797
We had the bear.

345
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:35,755
Incredible! It has made everyone from getting into the water.

346
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:16,299
What are you thinking?

347
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:19,050
What are you thinking, Father?

348
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:23,508
I'm thinking, you know, doing this will be difficult.

349
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:28,133
I do not know if it's okay.

350
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:50,051
It is different when the bear is close, we can take a picture with him closely.

351
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,508
But with a scenario that is not good.

352
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:56,675
We have a document of the bear, but we do not have a photo.

353
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,593
This is not right.

354
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,134
There's nothing behind.

355
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,884
Nothing to frame the photo, to beautify the landscape.

356
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:14,302
Not have stock, we have nothing.

357
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:50,643
Awesome!

358
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:54,186
The image I had in the end, are the teeth out,

359
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,561
They could not discern the shapes of heads, stunning.

360
00:36:57,687 --> 00:37:00,478
Like we were in Dante's Inferno,

361
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:02,769
with all those teeth,

362
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:05,060
all these forms ... Incredible!

363
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:29,937
Father, talk to me a little of your 1979?

364
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:37,145
In 79, Lélia was pregnant, expecting her second child.

365
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:39,479
It would be child already knew.

366
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:43,562
And when Rodrigo was born,

367
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:48,605
everything was going to be Down syndrome.

368
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:52,896
It was nice, torn eyes,

369
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:56,896
and I had the impression that it was completely normal.

370
00:37:57,022 --> 00:37:58,771
And also Lélia.

371
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:05,646
The doctor did many tests. Three weeks await your response.

372
00:38:05,773 --> 00:38:07,896
The day I called the doctor

373
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:11,981
I felt such a strong tension,

374
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,689
when I saw the answer, I cried.

375
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:16,813
He could not stop mourn.

376
00:38:22,357 --> 00:38:26,396
My little brother would never be able to go to school,

377
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:29,898
or read and write like me.

378
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:34,023
Rodrigo would be isolated in a world that we were never going to be able to share.

379
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,772
It was very difficult for my parents.

380
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,107
But then something happened.

381
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:44,523
Thanks to love, Rodrigo created his own language.

382
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:46,607
Slowly,

383
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:50,898
as a family, we learned to decipher their emotional alphabet

384
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:53,439
and communicate without words.

385
00:38:57,774 --> 00:39:02,107
Poce later, my mother, my brother and I took a plane to Brazil.

386
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:05,066
The military dictatorship had fallen.

387
00:39:05,192 --> 00:39:10,690
Topic five years and did not understand how important this trip was going to be.

388
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,983
At one point, a man climbed one of the blinds

389
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:18,650
and sunlight flooded the interior of the aircraft.

390
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,817
A voice echoed in the cabin:

391
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,067
"We are flying over Brazil."

392
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:27,734
My mother looked out the window and said nothing.

393
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,442
He was seeing his homeland for the first time after many years.

394
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:36,734
It was a moment of happiness, and yet, when I looked,

395
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:38,900
I was crying.

396
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:46,110
My father was in French Guiana and would come later.

397
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:51,068
December 31, returning to Brazil.

398
00:39:51,194 --> 00:39:54,276
It was great to get to your country,

399
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:58,026
After 10 years, half out.

400
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:03,401
It was shocking. Lelia had left the Vitoria was not found.

401
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:08,026
Vitória urbanism had changed. Everything had changed.

402
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:11,486
My region had changed.

403
00:40:12,152 --> 00:40:17,069
I met again with my parents. The I left young and strong.

404
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:21,819
On returning I found an old man. My father was very old.

405
00:40:22,695 --> 00:40:23,986
But, at that time,

406
00:40:24,112 --> 00:40:27,610
I wanted to see Brazil further.

407
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:30,569
My sister gave me a car

408
00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:35,152
and I traveled for six months in the northeast of Brazil.

409
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:37,277
He did not know the northeast.

410
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:40,737
He had always dreamed of northeastern Brazil.

411
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:06,278
I met these people on a funeral.

412
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:11,196
I parked on the side of the road and went with them.

413
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:18,154
Infant mortality was very high in the northeast of Brazil.

414
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:22,321
These are children who died before baptism.

415
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:27,447
It is believed that unbaptized children

416
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,447
They have no right to go to heaven.

417
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:36,404
They stay in a region between both worlds, called limbo.

418
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:42,447
Children buried with his eyes closed, they were baptized.

419
00:41:42,573 --> 00:41:44,239
If his eyes were open ...

420
00:41:44,365 --> 00:41:47,780
and they buried him to find his way.

421
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:52,615
Otherwise, it was wandering for eternity.

422
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:05,323
At that time, the coffins were rented in the church.

423
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,906
Rent the coffin was cheaper.

424
00:42:08,574 --> 00:42:11,906
The same coffin was used dozens of times.

425
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:22,824
This is perfectly seen the coffins to rent ...

426
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:27,657
and these are shoes.

427
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:32,199
He sold everything: shoes, coffins, bananas, vegetables,

428
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:35,241
ice cream, all ...

429
00:42:36,158 --> 00:42:41,824
It is an area of ​​the world where life and death are very close.

430
00:42:45,326 --> 00:42:49,575
Here is a prayer group

431
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:53,282
exerting political work at the same time.

432
00:42:54,034 --> 00:42:57,532
In Brazil, we had and still have

433
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,742
a great movement of landless peasants.

434
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:05,533
Many of them, the majority come from here.

435
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:08,908
Proviene del northeast of Brazil.

436
00:43:15,785 --> 00:43:16,784
They are people

437
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,784
a great moral force,

438
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,368
great physical strength,

439
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:27,451
despite being very fragile because they eat poorly.

440
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,118
Look at the dryness of the area. It is very dry.

441
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:36,909
Why so, we have a piece of Sahel here in Brazil.

442
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:41,868
And here in the street,

443
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,119
people leave for good.

444
00:43:45,454 --> 00:43:48,495
Sometimes the land is so dry, so hard,

445
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:51,202
people migrate to cities in the south.

446
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,494
They give up, leave the land.

447
00:44:15,747 --> 00:44:17,494
FARM SALGALO

448
00:44:17,495 --> 00:44:19,621
MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

449
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,120
We have spent many years suffering a shortage of rain.

450
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:43,329
Here we had many cattle.

451
00:44:43,455 --> 00:44:45,705
Now we have nothing, it's over.

452
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:48,765
The drought was great.

453
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,900
He finished with pastures, ended income.

454
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:55,288
How it ended, Grandpa? Why it's over?

455
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:57,305
It ended because of the drought.

456
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:04,289
He stood around, but no one saw or a grass grow.

457
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:06,456
Now we just have time.

458
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:09,330
Between your father and I,

459
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:12,455
20,000 invested in that.

460
00:45:12,998 --> 00:45:14,123
Where you are?

461
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:18,039
Here he abounded all.

462
00:45:18,664 --> 00:45:23,164
There were many birds many sparrows.

463
00:45:23,582 --> 00:45:27,165
Canarios, tico-ticos,

464
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:29,456
zorzales ...

465
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:34,664
There on the hill, there was a good kill.

466
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,748
And in that summit also he had a very good head.

467
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:42,374
There is much erosion.

468
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,301
Now, for example, the land is bonded.

469
00:45:44,415 --> 00:45:48,655
If rains come, there no grass, nothing,

470
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:52,790
to hold, cause a disaster.

471
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,666
I have no idea ...

472
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:59,230
to know how to stop erosion.

473
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:11,000
He grandfather, he was in the hacienda happy?

474
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:12,125
What?

475
00:46:12,251 --> 00:46:15,000
If I was in this hacienda happy?

476
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,459
¿Si was happy?

477
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:21,458
I was happy to have my children.

478
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:24,166
I raised all, seven women,

479
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:27,208
with six career as Tiao.

480
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:30,458
I raised my children here with difficulty.

481
00:46:30,877 --> 00:46:32,167
I was happy.

482
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,182
Only wood I took over a hundred contos

483
00:46:39,752 --> 00:46:41,959
to take my children to school.

484
00:46:42,085 --> 00:46:45,460
All were raised with good nutrition

485
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:47,751
with good clothes.

486
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:57,668
Since I arrived in Brazil, the land of my grandfather have been.

487
00:46:58,044 --> 00:47:01,335
Burned and dry.

488
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:06,668
When Sebastião returned to the farm after traveling the northeast of Brazil,

489
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:10,793
the place had nothing to do with paradise he remembered as a child.

490
00:47:11,212 --> 00:47:14,418
But he worried about something else.

491
00:47:14,544 --> 00:47:18,127
The suffering he saw, changed.

492
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:22,335
His role as a photographer took on new meaning.

493
00:47:22,462 --> 00:47:25,503
We understood how important it was for him to leave.

494
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:32,919
She missed him terribly, but I understood.

495
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,461
Sahel, THE END OF THE ROAD 1984-1986

496
00:47:44,587 --> 00:47:48,795
For his next project, which would lead to Sahel in Africa,

497
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,755
Sebastião began working with MSF.

498
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:01,255
I worked in Ethiopia in 1984.

499
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:06,962
And then I continued throughout the Sahel, 85 and 86.

500
00:48:07,213 --> 00:48:11,130
Finally, spend nearly two years in a row in this region

501
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:14,588
doing a story about hunger.

502
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:20,005
There was a refugee camp,

503
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,296
the largest in the history of mankind so far.

504
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:26,713
I had a wild desire to show that.

505
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,838
To show that there was a large part of humanity

506
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,922
He is living in poverty.

507
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:38,131
Which it was mostly a problem of deals

508
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:41,922
not just a question of natural disasters.

509
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:47,381
It was a Coptic region

510
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:51,589
They are Christians in northern Ethiopia,

511
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:54,048
of tremendous humility.

512
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:57,131
They are unable, even with a child about to die,

513
00:48:57,257 --> 00:48:59,922
to take the lead of others.

514
00:49:00,048 --> 00:49:01,964
They prefer to wait.

515
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:11,048
Look at the state are.

516
00:49:12,924 --> 00:49:16,758
In that state, one does not stand long.

517
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:20,798
In those fields hunger killed many lives.

518
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:24,590
Causes physical discomfort,

519
00:49:24,716 --> 00:49:27,674
but other diseases that they kill.

520
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,132
If we take the anger, we become dehydrated quickly.

521
00:49:34,258 --> 00:49:38,674
We can lose up to 12 liters of fluid a day due to diarrhea

522
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:41,590
and die in two or three days.

523
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:48,758
So young faces

524
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:53,759
and so aged by suffering.

525
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:57,509
If you look at the front, it is not elderly,

526
00:49:57,635 --> 00:50:01,341
it has aged are the eyes, which are empty.

527
00:50:01,593 --> 00:50:04,717
Look how young he is. Look at your baby.

528
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,175
He was her husband.

529
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:15,426
During the night because of the cold, many deaths they occur.

530
00:50:18,968 --> 00:50:22,925
Dying here is like a continuation of life.

531
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:25,593
People get used to die.

532
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:30,552
A husband to his wife washed before burial.

533
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:38,094
With mountain clothes, dressed in goatskins.

534
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,844
A pretty young woman.

535
00:50:49,553 --> 00:50:51,802
According to Coptic beliefs,

536
00:50:51,928 --> 00:50:55,844
the body must be clean for the encounter with God.

537
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,136
It should be washed, wash it all

538
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:02,178
although water is scarce.

539
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:09,844
Every person killed is a piece of the world that dies.

540
00:51:18,096 --> 00:51:21,512
A father prepares his son for burial,

541
00:51:21,638 --> 00:51:24,137
to say the last goodbye.

542
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:30,012
Usually it is the family that prepares its dead.

543
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,887
And know that the government

544
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:44,929
retains food, not allowed to reach the population

545
00:51:45,055 --> 00:51:48,013
as happened there,

546
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,680
in that field in northern Ethiopia ...

547
00:51:51,098 --> 00:51:55,471
It was a brutal political dishonesty.

548
00:52:07,306 --> 00:52:10,097
Ethiopia Tigray Region, 1984

549
00:52:10,473 --> 00:52:15,055
I returned to Ethiopia in late 1984.

550
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:20,097
By then, the guerrillas realized that the government was plundering the region.

551
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:23,348
They began to send people to Sudan.

552
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:27,140
They went through the region of Tigray.

553
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:33,431
There was an attack by two helicopters.

554
00:52:33,557 --> 00:52:37,266
They were Mi-24 combat helicopters very fast.

555
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:39,931
They shot people with machine guns.

556
00:52:41,307 --> 00:52:43,807
I took a picture and ran.

557
00:52:47,683 --> 00:52:50,099
Many pregnant women walked

558
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:55,806
hoping to be able to eat and drink water

559
00:52:55,933 --> 00:52:58,641
to reach the promised land.

560
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:05,099
I had to go there

561
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,307
at least two more months.

562
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:11,057
And when I arrived in Sudan,

563
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:14,557
I had a lot of work with the arrival of these people.

564
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:21,308
This man came from Ethiopia.

565
00:53:21,434 --> 00:53:24,808
His son was exhausted, perhaps dead,

566
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:27,225
but the man was carrying.

567
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:30,559
When he got to the doctors the child was dead,

568
00:53:32,184 --> 00:53:34,518
after so much walking.

569
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,226
We had to decamp from MSF.

570
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:49,642
Water is essential in these camps

571
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,559
and it was becoming a big problem.

572
00:53:51,685 --> 00:53:54,934
You had to move as quickly as possible.

573
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,226
They piled into the trucks of the United Nations

574
00:54:03,478 --> 00:54:06,935
to take them to another camp,

575
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:10,435
a beautiful and fertile land

576
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,227
on the banks of the Blue Nile.

577
00:54:14,145 --> 00:54:18,352
I did about 300, 400 kilometers aboard these trucks.

578
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:24,436
Two of my friends truck,

579
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:28,728
They acted as if it were a Sunday afternoon either,

580
00:54:28,854 --> 00:54:32,435
and they were telling stories under a tree.

581
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:39,395
Being close to the Nile, we had water.

582
00:54:39,521 --> 00:54:43,271
But here people died

583
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,436
because there was no food.

584
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:48,728
They reached the edge of poverty.

585
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,812
They forgot or could not bring food.

586
00:54:56,938 --> 00:54:59,729
There was a disorganization of food.

587
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:02,062
They said there was, that there was.

588
00:55:02,188 --> 00:55:05,022
And when I got here there was nothing.

589
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:18,563
Me fui a Mali.

590
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,230
Here too there was a great drought.

591
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:27,188
The skin of the people were like the bark of trees.

592
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:31,272
Trees marked by wind and sand,

593
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,981
by sandstorms.

594
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,105
There were only women and children.

595
00:55:47,357 --> 00:55:49,981
The men went to Libya to work,

596
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:55,314
or they migrated to Ivory Coast in search of work

597
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,232
with the promise to return and bring food for the family.

598
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:01,815
But very few returned.

599
00:56:11,858 --> 00:56:14,148
All were safe

600
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:17,149
because MSF did a great job.

601
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:20,399
They brought aid to the region.

602
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,732
This is a friend, Luc, a Belgian doctor.

603
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,399
It is measuring and weighing the child.

604
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:38,233
After 15, 20 days, they were unrecognizable, healthier.

605
00:56:38,359 --> 00:56:41,065
But they were scarred for life

606
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:45,566
because they lacked things during growth.

607
00:56:50,901 --> 00:56:52,566
This kid was alone,

608
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:56,484
with his little guitar in hand,

609
00:56:56,609 --> 00:57:00,151
He is carrying the remains of a shirt,

610
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:02,235
but not wearing pants.

611
00:57:03,568 --> 00:57:07,568
Watch her determination, her posture.

612
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:11,026
He is someone who knows where it goes.

613
00:57:11,152 --> 00:57:15,693
Looking for other groups of people,

614
00:57:16,527 --> 00:57:17,818
with your dog ...

615
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:20,778
A boy of eight, nine years.

616
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:29,111
Sebastian is encariñó

617
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,443
with the people of the Sahel region.

618
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:34,611
Again and again.

619
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:40,818
Photos, the book and the exhibition of Lélia

620
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:43,612
They called the world's attention on droughts,

621
00:57:43,737 --> 00:57:45,903
and the fate of millions of lives.

622
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,569
And unanswered questions about the cause of that situation.

623
00:57:52,612 --> 00:57:57,195
Then Sebastião turned to a topic that he spent another six years

624
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,529
and countless trips to almost thirty countries.

625
00:58:01,696 --> 00:58:02,986
WORKERS

626
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:08,296
The third volume of photographs conceived with Lélia.

627
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,945
I wanted to pay a kind of homage

628
00:58:12,487 --> 00:58:16,404
all men and women who built our world.

629
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:19,908
The archeology of the industrial era.

630
00:58:21,613 --> 00:58:23,737
Sebastian y Lelia investigaron

631
00:58:23,863 --> 00:58:26,529
and planned "Workers" meticulously.

632
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:31,279
Then he again traveled to the four corners of the world.

633
00:58:33,446 --> 00:58:35,728
He photographed steelworkers in the Soviet Union,

634
00:58:35,947 --> 00:58:37,822
he lived with saboteurs ships in Bangladesh,

635
00:58:38,446 --> 00:58:41,446
sailed with fishermen in Galicia and Sicily,

636
00:58:41,903 --> 00:58:44,738
He showed the mechanical production of cars in Kolkata.

637
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:47,155
He watched farmers in Rwanda,

638
00:58:47,281 --> 00:58:50,322
country had already visited, but as an economist.

639
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:53,322
Now the mission was another.

640
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:57,238
His perspective had changed, but he was the same.

641
00:58:57,574 --> 00:59:01,363
Driven by the same empathy for the human condition.

642
00:59:01,907 --> 00:59:04,698
With each episode of "workers"

643
00:59:05,163 --> 00:59:07,281
Sebastião was completely submerged

644
00:59:08,407 --> 00:59:10,821
in the field of manual labor.

645
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:14,406
As the weeks passed with miners in the gold mines of Serra Pelada.

646
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:21,993
In 1991, at the end of the first Gulf War,

647
00:59:22,028 --> 00:59:23,532
Iraqi troops withdrew

648
00:59:23,657 --> 00:59:27,253
and Saddam Hussein set fire to thousands of oil wells.

649
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:32,823
Thousands of firefighters from around the world descended on those oil fields.

650
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:36,241
Sebastião had to go too,

651
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:40,241
driven by curiosity of this explosive profession.

652
00:59:49,075 --> 00:59:52,198
When I saw the first images on TV,

653
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:56,574
I knew I had to do that report.

654
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:01,366
It was like working in a big theater.

655
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,199
Some 500 wells on fire.

656
01:00:04,325 --> 01:00:08,741
A scene set in huge, the size of a planet.

657
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:13,367
No controlled us, we could go where we wanted.

658
01:00:14,868 --> 01:00:19,034
There were fumes, thick smoke, oil.

659
01:00:19,618 --> 01:00:24,325
All that accumulated smoke was so dense that the sun did not pass.

660
01:00:24,786 --> 01:00:31,242
Sometimes it was dark 24 hours.

661
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:39,575
After putting out the fire

662
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:42,660
the ground was so hot,

663
01:00:42,786 --> 01:00:46,951
I had to throw a lot of water for cooling,

664
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:51,744
if not, the temperature was so high that oil burn again.

665
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,827
Still, sometimes,

666
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:59,161
There was an explosion that sounded like a cannon.

667
01:01:00,162 --> 01:01:02,410
The noise was deafening.

668
01:01:02,536 --> 01:01:06,369
It was like working near the engine of a plane.

669
01:01:07,036 --> 01:01:09,201
Today I'm a little deaf.

670
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:11,786
My deafness began then.

671
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:29,952
These are Canadians,

672
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,745
The Calgary Fire Department.

673
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:36,953
They brought a nice red truck.

674
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,538
And they had a rule: after putting out the fire,

675
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,828
I had to wash the truck every night.

676
01:01:43,954 --> 01:01:47,287
The next morning, returned to be covered in oil.

677
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,288
A hell of a job!

678
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,538
I delayed my departure at least two or three times.

679
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:04,163
Until the day I had to leave.

680
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:07,539
It broke my heart

681
01:02:07,665 --> 01:02:11,038
having to leave such a huge show.

682
01:02:13,373 --> 01:02:15,288
I turned around,

683
01:02:15,414 --> 01:02:17,955
until near the end,

684
01:02:18,248 --> 01:02:22,122
when we passed a big wall.

685
01:02:22,248 --> 01:02:25,747
That day was a reporter for the New York Times.

686
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:30,789
It was no longer anyone's territory. The war had destroyed everything.

687
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,955
We broke the door.

688
01:02:33,206 --> 01:02:34,623
Upon entering,

689
01:02:35,415 --> 01:02:37,955
a species discovered

690
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:39,539
Paradise

691
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:41,705
become a hell.

692
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:46,414
It was a kind of Garden of the royal family of Kuwait.

693
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:50,705
There were horses, thoroughbreds,

694
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,666
they had gone completely mad.

695
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:59,415
The animals are the first to escape before a catastrophe,

696
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:02,081
if they are free to escape.

697
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:04,624
But there they were not.

698
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:08,665
Birds found there, it was an oasis.

699
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:10,999
Everything was well irrigated.

700
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:16,374
Birds that could not fly because they were glued feathers.

701
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:23,374
Kuwaitis left to reach the disaster

702
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,291
leaving the confined animals,

703
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:31,082
together with the Bedouins, who are not considered human beings.

704
01:03:33,067 --> 01:03:37,497
"Workers" managed to unite the Sebastião Salgado economist

705
01:03:37,532 --> 01:03:39,625
with the artist in which he had become.

706
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,417
These photographs have been published in the best journals,

707
01:03:43,543 --> 01:03:45,583
the exhibition toured the world,

708
01:03:45,709 --> 01:03:48,459
and the book was published in many languages.

709
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:53,001
Pero Sebastian y Lelia in pararon.

710
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:58,375
They immediately began work on a new phase of his photography.

711
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:02,751
They noted that another burning issue of our times

712
01:04:03,085 --> 01:04:05,834
It was the displacement of entire populations

713
01:04:05,961 --> 01:04:09,876
due to wars, famines and the role of the global market.

714
01:04:10,835 --> 01:04:14,335
As Europe closed its borders,

715
01:04:14,628 --> 01:04:19,126
Sebastião trying to shed light on the lives of the marginalized.

716
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:24,752
Again with Lelia, he began researching and planning.

717
01:04:24,877 --> 01:04:28,836
She was again the momentum of this new chapter

718
01:04:28,961 --> 01:04:31,210
which they called "Exodus".

719
01:04:31,753 --> 01:04:33,377
EXODUS

720
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:38,377
It sparked global concern about the lives of these refugees

721
01:04:38,503 --> 01:04:40,544
de India, Vietnam, Filipinas,

722
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,711
South America, Palestine, Iraq

723
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,628
and many other places.

724
01:04:45,546 --> 01:04:49,127
But Sebastião returned again and again to the continent

725
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:53,045
I had captivated his imagination for some time already.

726
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:55,128
A África.

727
01:05:06,046 --> 01:05:09,211
I was doing my project on population movements

728
01:05:11,962 --> 01:05:15,211
in 1994, when the Rwandan president's plane

729
01:05:15,797 --> 01:05:17,796
He was killed.

730
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:21,879
It all started with a great movement of population to Tanzania

731
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:26,879
due to the brutal repression against the Tutsis in Rwanda.

732
01:05:28,338 --> 01:05:31,962
And I was one of the first to arrive.

733
01:05:32,672 --> 01:05:34,837
It was a catastrophe.

734
01:05:34,963 --> 01:05:37,297
People who fled to Burundi,

735
01:05:37,547 --> 01:05:39,880
al Congo, a Uganda...

736
01:05:40,006 --> 01:05:42,171
They fled to everywhere.

737
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:50,256
The streets were full of people.

738
01:05:53,298 --> 01:05:55,422
People resting on the side of the road,

739
01:05:55,548 --> 01:05:59,381
he carried all their belongings on bicycles ...

740
01:05:59,506 --> 01:06:02,464
People who fled with what they could.

741
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:06,839
We follow the path in the opposite direction.

742
01:06:07,132 --> 01:06:10,338
We went to the border.

743
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:13,213
There was no security, no nothing.

744
01:06:13,339 --> 01:06:17,424
I came to Rwanda and that was frightening.

745
01:06:17,631 --> 01:06:22,173
The death toll I met on these roads.

746
01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:26,798
It had broken Granada.

747
01:06:27,465 --> 01:06:31,964
Those who were not killed by the Granada were killed with machetes.

748
01:06:32,758 --> 01:06:36,214
I understood the magnitude

749
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:40,174
the catastrophe he was seeing.

750
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,841
Genocide was committed in that country.

751
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:51,633
Were about 150 kilometers to the outskirts of Kigali,

752
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,508
and 150 kilometers of dead.

753
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:06,258
I returned because my story was about you people.

754
01:07:06,384 --> 01:07:10,383
He was writing a book on refugees, on the exodus.

755
01:07:10,843 --> 01:07:12,967
I went into these camps

756
01:07:13,384 --> 01:07:15,092
and I began to see

757
01:07:15,218 --> 01:07:19,008
the number of people who left Rwanda.

758
01:07:21,177 --> 01:07:24,009
Hell settled in this paradise.

759
01:07:24,927 --> 01:07:27,467
It was frightening

760
01:07:27,593 --> 01:07:31,176
see how in such a beautiful savanna

761
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:34,426
He had formed a megacity.

762
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,842
Within days, there were almost a million people there.

763
01:07:47,469 --> 01:07:51,303
Amid all this anguish, something touched me very much.

764
01:07:51,636 --> 01:07:55,135
It was seeing this mother with her little,

765
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:59,010
and little confidence in her mother.

766
01:08:12,304 --> 01:08:13,844
Violence

767
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:16,177
and brutality

768
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:19,678
they are not a monopoly

769
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,761
of distant countries.

770
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,136
It is here, in Europe, in the former Yugoslavia.

771
01:08:25,262 --> 01:08:27,262
It's very shocking.

772
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:33,970
On a bus coming from Krajina, Croatia across ...

773
01:08:35,138 --> 01:08:37,511
One person was killed through that hole.

774
01:08:37,637 --> 01:08:41,637
Croats killed many people to leave Krajina.

775
01:08:42,346 --> 01:08:44,137
Violence is widespread.

776
01:08:44,264 --> 01:08:47,595
What I dislike most

777
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:51,804
It is to see how much hatred is contagious.

778
01:08:52,555 --> 01:08:54,971
These people have seen violence.

779
01:08:55,346 --> 01:08:56,637
Entire families.

780
01:08:56,764 --> 01:09:00,930
All Krajina Serb population was expelled.

781
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:07,471
From time to time they were driven from their homes

782
01:09:07,597 --> 01:09:09,846
looking for a place where to go.

783
01:09:09,972 --> 01:09:14,430
They had their neighbors in front and shooting at them.

784
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:32,347
This is a refugee camp near Tuzla,

785
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:35,930
en la Bosnia central.

786
01:09:36,056 --> 01:09:39,014
They are families fleeing the enclave of Zepa,

787
01:09:39,683 --> 01:09:43,181
where Serbs killed thousands of young people.

788
01:09:44,183 --> 01:09:49,389
We were there at the right time. Just as families arrived

789
01:09:49,974 --> 01:09:52,557
in a state of high anxiety.

790
01:10:04,058 --> 01:10:06,891
There were only women, elderly

791
01:10:07,308 --> 01:10:08,848
and children.

792
01:10:08,974 --> 01:10:13,390
The young men had been detained or killed.

793
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,516
It is rare that this happens in Europe,

794
01:10:22,642 --> 01:10:25,807
the late twentieth century.

795
01:10:26,142 --> 01:10:27,558
But here, the cars,

796
01:10:27,684 --> 01:10:31,558
we can see that those people with a standard of living

797
01:10:31,684 --> 01:10:33,684
a European standard of living,

798
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:36,850
with a European intellectual level.

799
01:10:37,184 --> 01:10:39,349
A European infrastructure.

800
01:10:39,726 --> 01:10:41,142
And who lost everything.

801
01:10:45,393 --> 01:10:49,350
Hundreds of kilometers filled with people and cars.

802
01:10:53,435 --> 01:10:55,310
We are a very fierce animal.

803
01:10:55,436 --> 01:10:58,310
We are a terrible animal, we humans.

804
01:10:59,769 --> 01:11:03,560
It is here in Europe, whether in Africa, Latin America, wherever.

805
01:11:03,686 --> 01:11:06,350
Our violence is extreme.

806
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,393
Our history is a history of wars.

807
01:11:22,603 --> 01:11:24,101
It is a story without end,

808
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:26,352
a history of repression,

809
01:11:26,478 --> 01:11:28,144
crazy story.

810
01:11:37,063 --> 01:11:39,812
The situation in Rwanda continued to evolve.

811
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:44,103
The Hutu army, which had the power, was defeated.

812
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:49,312
And he retired to the Congo and the region of Goma.

813
01:11:50,646 --> 01:11:55,187
First, the Tutsis had fled the barbarity of the Hutus.

814
01:11:55,313 --> 01:11:57,062
Then they were Hutus

815
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:59,896
those fleeing Tutsi occupation.

816
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,062
So they all fled.

817
01:12:05,188 --> 01:12:07,021
In several days,

818
01:12:07,146 --> 01:12:10,103
in the month of July 1994

819
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:11,645
Goma region

820
01:12:11,771 --> 01:12:14,812
He welcomed more than two million people.

821
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:18,895
And there catastrophe was installed,

822
01:12:21,897 --> 01:12:24,813
diseases such as cholera began to spread

823
01:12:24,939 --> 01:12:28,729
and people started dropping like flies.

824
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:32,604
There were at least 12,000 or 15,000 deaths a day.

825
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:39,355
I took pictures of piles of dead like this.

826
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:42,605
I saw that father approached with his child,

827
01:12:43,022 --> 01:12:44,522
and throw it there.

828
01:12:44,648 --> 01:12:48,855
He was chatting with fellow like that.

829
01:12:55,648 --> 01:12:58,729
We did not give supply to bury people.

830
01:12:59,773 --> 01:13:02,690
Machine brought a French army

831
01:13:02,941 --> 01:13:06,648
and caught galore, dozens,

832
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:08,980
They threw them on the ground

833
01:13:09,106 --> 01:13:11,856
and covered with soil.

834
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:31,565
Everyone should see these images,

835
01:13:32,025 --> 01:13:34,940
to see how terrible it is our species.

836
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:44,941
These orphans, I found them on the road ...

837
01:13:46,818 --> 01:13:48,274
Of these three children

838
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,983
the two with the most lively eyes will survive.

839
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:56,150
The eyes of the morbid, he was dying.

840
01:13:58,775 --> 01:14:01,567
When I left there, I was sick.

841
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:04,233
Very sick. My body was sick.

842
01:14:04,443 --> 01:14:07,942
It was not an infectious disease,

843
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:10,192
my soul was sick.

844
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:19,151
I went to Rwanda a year after the disaster

845
01:14:19,277 --> 01:14:24,069
for the return of Hutus, who were in the Congo

846
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:26,318
and they had nowhere to go.

847
01:14:26,444 --> 01:14:30,776
The United Nations began to force them to return.

848
01:14:41,695 --> 01:14:45,985
We felt that the whole planet was covered in refugee tents.

849
01:14:59,153 --> 01:15:01,152
After working there,

850
01:15:01,277 --> 01:15:05,819
Tutsi authorities proposed visit me

851
01:15:05,945 --> 01:15:09,860
several places, scenes of repression.

852
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:21,486
People took refuge in a church thinking that could be saved.

853
01:15:22,197 --> 01:15:24,695
All were killed.

854
01:15:31,237 --> 01:15:33,445
This was at a school,

855
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:38,611
You can still see the blackboard with written when passing through.

856
01:15:38,738 --> 01:15:40,821
it was scary.

857
01:15:54,738 --> 01:15:58,904
Of people who left Rwanda, some two million people,

858
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:01,697
some returned to Rwanda,

859
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,529
but the other feared a possible crackdown.

860
01:16:04,655 --> 01:16:09,697
A group of 250,000 people left the city of Goma

861
01:16:09,822 --> 01:16:12,073
and he went into the Congo forest.

862
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,489
We lost.

863
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:20,573
Everyone knew they were lost 250,000 people.

864
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:22,655
We did not know where they were.

865
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,197
Six months later,

866
01:16:27,782 --> 01:16:32,406
They began to appear Kisangani in central Congo.

867
01:16:34,825 --> 01:16:38,489
They were in the forest for six months.

868
01:16:39,615 --> 01:16:44,864
And here, the UN High Commissioner was taking me right there.

869
01:16:46,032 --> 01:16:49,156
There was a train and rode me.

870
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,615
The train, after leaving the food, he should return.

871
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:06,283
I spent three days with these people kept coming.

872
01:17:06,409 --> 01:17:09,032
Groups and groups of people coming.

873
01:17:11,366 --> 01:17:14,866
But when you think about 250,000 people left,

874
01:17:14,992 --> 01:17:17,658
and 40,000 returnees ...

875
01:17:17,992 --> 01:17:22,033
210,000 people were missing.

876
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:34,366
And in parallel, life continued.

877
01:17:34,492 --> 01:17:39,200
Men who cut hair.

878
01:17:40,117 --> 01:17:42,452
And this Congolese here,

879
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:44,325
with his calculator

880
01:17:45,618 --> 01:17:51,159
dollars trying to collect people,

881
01:17:51,285 --> 01:17:54,534
currencies, and it was there trying to change them.

882
01:17:54,994 --> 01:17:59,410
In the middle of nowhere! Amid a forest isolated from everything.

883
01:18:06,827 --> 01:18:08,035
At one point,

884
01:18:08,536 --> 01:18:13,077
that the guerrillas Kisangani, which was protutsi,

885
01:18:13,203 --> 01:18:15,577
and he began to cast these people.

886
01:18:15,953 --> 01:18:17,493
To send them back.

887
01:18:17,619 --> 01:18:21,994
They had to walk another six months to return to Rwanda.

888
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,202
They began to kill some.

889
01:18:25,328 --> 01:18:29,827
There, I met people who could not more.

890
01:18:30,454 --> 01:18:33,244
They had begun to rave,

891
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,285
They had lost his mind.

892
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:36,993
They had gone mad.

893
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:45,786
In fact, this people who were expelled,

894
01:18:46,204 --> 01:18:48,494
We have not heard anything.

895
01:18:49,913 --> 01:18:52,370
I'm sure they were all killed.

896
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:05,245
This was my last trip, this sad adventure in Rwanda.

897
01:19:08,996 --> 01:19:11,120
I went there.

898
01:19:12,705 --> 01:19:17,454
He does not believe in anything. He did not believe in the salvation of the human race.

899
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,246
We could not survive that.

900
01:19:20,372 --> 01:19:22,163
We did not deserve to live anymore.

901
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:24,246
No one deserved to live.

902
01:19:34,414 --> 01:19:39,414
How many times I threw the camera down to mourn for what he saw?

903
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:50,164
Sebastião had peered into the heart of darkness

904
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:53,871
and he questioned his work as a social photographer

905
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:57,122
and witness to the human condition.

906
01:19:57,332 --> 01:20:01,540
What remained to be done after Rwanda?

907
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:13,415
At that time, my grandfather's health worsened.

908
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:18,165
My parents had to return to Brazil to take over the farm.

909
01:20:18,749 --> 01:20:23,416
It was just barren land. They did not know what to do with that.

910
01:20:24,584 --> 01:20:28,791
Birds, alligators and forests had disappeared.

911
01:20:28,959 --> 01:20:33,015
There was no childhood memories of Sebastião.

912
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:40,291
Then Lélia had a surprising idea.

913
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:44,499
Why we not replant the forest that was here before?

914
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:51,750
The forest that was here before and that covered these hills

915
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,874
It was the Atlantic Forest.

916
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,374
The Atlantic forest.

917
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:59,250
No one had tried to replant.

918
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:03,292
Let alone over 600 hectares.

919
01:21:03,876 --> 01:21:07,292
The suggestion came from his desire Lélia

920
01:21:07,418 --> 01:21:09,792
to maintain the spirit of the family.

921
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:13,167
Anyway, they started using them

922
01:21:13,627 --> 01:21:15,959
and for the next 10 years

923
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:20,668
what happened in that land was a miracle

924
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:24,417
which it became, from that moment, the "Terra Institute".

925
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:33,917
I remember during the first planting,

926
01:21:34,044 --> 01:21:37,835
sometimes dreamed that night was dying all.

927
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:43,793
Because the soil was horrible. He was in such bad shape

928
01:21:43,919 --> 01:21:47,043
I wondered. Are the plants take root?

929
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:51,752
In the Atlantic Forest there were 400 different species,

930
01:21:51,878 --> 01:21:54,795
we did not have 400,

931
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:59,585
but just we planted 100 species, 150 ...

932
01:21:59,877 --> 01:22:04,086
It is true that the first planting lost 60%.

933
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,920
In the second, 40.

934
01:22:08,045 --> 01:22:12,587
There were no books to teach to replant an Atlantic forest.

935
01:22:32,088 --> 01:22:34,045
I love coming here

936
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:37,338
to see all these trees together.

937
01:22:37,589 --> 01:22:39,962
When you see this forest mass,

938
01:22:41,004 --> 01:22:44,963
an idea of ​​the effort involved in planting all this is done.

939
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,546
When I was little,

940
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,504
there was a small waterfall.

941
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:57,297
All year, here was a waterfall that fell.

942
01:22:57,423 --> 01:23:02,254
I came with my sisters and we made a picnic under the jump.

943
01:23:03,089 --> 01:23:05,547
There was still a lot of forest.

944
01:23:05,923 --> 01:23:07,046
Then

945
01:23:07,506 --> 01:23:11,047
when felled trees, the water disappeared.

946
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:15,464
Now our forest is young, needs lots of water.

947
01:23:17,423 --> 01:23:21,755
But within 10 or 15 years, when everything stabilizes,

948
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:26,005
I'm sure it will reappear another beautiful waterfall.

949
01:23:47,881 --> 01:23:49,049
They are

950
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:52,256
many small roads,

951
01:23:52,382 --> 01:23:54,799
hundreds of small ways ...

952
01:23:55,508 --> 01:23:57,382
Cows go there.

953
01:23:58,257 --> 01:24:02,632
Each leg of cow that sits on a small perimeter,

954
01:24:02,758 --> 01:24:06,091
They are 200 or 250 kilos of blow.

955
01:24:06,217 --> 01:24:09,716
Crushes the earth, the dry,

956
01:24:09,843 --> 01:24:11,716
and no longer sprout again nothing.

957
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,174
It is very interesting to note the difference

958
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:20,425
of what it was before the Terra Institute, smooth pastures like this

959
01:24:20,551 --> 01:24:23,841
and the other a fully recovered ecosystem.

960
01:24:23,967 --> 01:24:26,300
With ten million trees replanted.

961
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:49,676
Here we see

962
01:24:49,927 --> 01:24:54,594
cicada singing until he dies.

963
01:24:55,259 --> 01:24:58,760
I'm sure it was not the tree.

964
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:02,634
Are the termites that are assimilating.

965
01:25:02,761 --> 01:25:04,759
He will be buried here.

966
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:18,719
Sometimes, just we look at a tree and think about its verticality, in its beauty.

967
01:25:18,845 --> 01:25:24,135
But everything depends on it, our water, our oxygen ...

968
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:26,178
It is home to everyone.

969
01:25:26,636 --> 01:25:29,594
Ants, small insects, cicadas ...

970
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,136
All are in the tree.

971
01:25:32,386 --> 01:25:36,719
It is very pleasant to touch a tree planting have helped.

972
01:25:37,137 --> 01:25:40,677
It is here, well established, well robust.

973
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:44,261
Within 30 years it will be as well.

974
01:25:44,513 --> 01:25:47,345
He is still very young, is growing.

975
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,804
Look, the youngest there, very young, here.

976
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,761
They may have erupted tonight,

977
01:25:54,637 --> 01:25:57,720
like Alice entering the wonderland.

978
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:03,428
And most incredible is that it will become a tree 40 to 50 meters.

979
01:26:03,554 --> 01:26:06,637
And who will live 400 years, 500 years.

980
01:26:06,763 --> 01:26:09,262
Here there is a great power.

981
01:26:13,847 --> 01:26:18,137
Think that these trees have three months

982
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:20,596
and will reach its climax at the 400 ...

983
01:26:21,889 --> 01:26:26,429
Maybe we can measure from here

984
01:26:26,555 --> 01:26:28,722
the concept of eternity.

985
01:26:29,015 --> 01:26:31,388
Perhaps eternity can be measured.

986
01:26:34,348 --> 01:26:37,222
The first few days after saying: "We will plant a forest"

987
01:26:37,349 --> 01:26:42,263
I thought the route was a seed to a small tree, a plant ...

988
01:26:42,389 --> 01:26:45,555
and that's it, but there is only a little plant, but a million.

989
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,638
And not just here.

990
01:26:48,765 --> 01:26:52,555
Also nearby. And more and more!

991
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:56,015
And that's the most wonderful thing, this idea

992
01:26:58,057 --> 01:27:00,265
You may evolve, it can grow.

993
01:27:00,391 --> 01:27:03,639
He's not someone's idea, but of all.

994
01:27:05,516 --> 01:27:09,223
Sampling method can replicate almost everywhere.

995
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,640
Of course, the species are not the same,

996
01:27:11,766 --> 01:27:14,515
but the way of acting is the same

997
01:27:15,099 --> 01:27:17,057
in all tropical forests.

998
01:27:30,267 --> 01:27:33,515
The land was the remedy to despair of Sebastião.

999
01:27:33,808 --> 01:27:38,557
The joy of seeing the trees grow, resurgent outbreaks,

1000
01:27:38,976 --> 01:27:44,266
He resurrected Sebastião passion for photography.

1001
01:27:44,766 --> 01:27:49,725
Although Lélia and he knew they could not return to their old ways.

1002
01:27:50,143 --> 01:27:51,641
We conclude

1003
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:55,475
that would start a new photographic project on the environment.

1004
01:27:55,684 --> 01:27:58,851
Of course, the first idea that came

1005
01:27:58,977 --> 01:28:01,767
It was to denounce the destruction of forests,

1006
01:28:01,892 --> 01:28:04,351
or pollution of the oceans,

1007
01:28:04,602 --> 01:28:05,391
He did not care.

1008
01:28:05,517 --> 01:28:09,475
Then gradually we start thinking. Let's do a different project.

1009
01:28:10,143 --> 01:28:12,267
Let a tribute to the planet.

1010
01:28:12,643 --> 01:28:15,184
And we discover with surprise

1011
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:18,142
nearly half of the planet

1012
01:28:18,685 --> 01:28:20,684
continues as the day of Genesis.

1013
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,017
Many of my friends told me. "Do not get into that.

1014
01:28:28,143 --> 01:28:31,892
It is very risky. You are a good human, social photographer,

1015
01:28:32,018 --> 01:28:35,643
and now you will enter in the field

1016
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:39,768
Photographers landscapes, animals. "

1017
01:28:39,895 --> 01:28:42,268
I said, "It's okay, I'm going for it!

1018
01:28:42,394 --> 01:28:45,893
I will learn to photograph these things too. "

1019
01:28:46,019 --> 01:28:47,935
And so I began the first story.

1020
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:50,893
Galapagos wanted it.

1021
01:28:51,228 --> 01:28:56,019
Darwin wanted to understand what he understood.

1022
01:28:57,062 --> 01:28:58,644
The same species,

1023
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:01,936
in very different ecosystems,

1024
01:29:02,062 --> 01:29:04,353
They have evolved very differently.

1025
01:29:06,896 --> 01:29:10,062
Looking at this detail of the leg of the iguana,

1026
01:29:10,188 --> 01:29:13,187
I can not help thinking

1027
01:29:13,687 --> 01:29:16,686
in the hand of a warrior of the Middle Ages.

1028
01:29:16,937 --> 01:29:20,770
With its metal to protect shells.

1029
01:29:23,938 --> 01:29:25,895
Looking at the structure of the hand,

1030
01:29:26,021 --> 01:29:29,771
I see that the iguana is also my cousin,

1031
01:29:30,313 --> 01:29:33,063
who we come from the same cell.

1032
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:40,645
We were facing a being of this age.

1033
01:29:40,771 --> 01:29:42,563
We are dealing with an authority,

1034
01:29:42,689 --> 01:29:45,480
with all its wrinkles, with all this knowledge.

1035
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:51,731
Certainly, when Darwin was here, that turtle was an adult.

1036
01:29:52,356 --> 01:29:54,605
Maybe he saw Darwin. Who knows?

1037
01:29:57,439 --> 01:29:59,521
I remember one time I was very tired

1038
01:29:59,647 --> 01:30:04,980
because he had walked through lava fields for a long time.

1039
01:30:05,107 --> 01:30:07,189
I had slept on the beach.

1040
01:30:08,064 --> 01:30:11,021
I felt something touch my leg.

1041
01:30:11,147 --> 01:30:13,814
I looked and it was a sea lion.

1042
01:30:14,232 --> 01:30:16,230
Had another installed across.

1043
01:30:16,356 --> 01:30:18,732
In the end, there were three sea lions.

1044
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,606
No man considered a predator, did not seem a threat.

1045
01:30:25,941 --> 01:30:28,689
It was my first story of nature,

1046
01:30:28,815 --> 01:30:32,107
the first time photographing animals.

1047
01:30:35,691 --> 01:30:39,398
For 8 years, I had time to see ...

1048
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:43,107
and understand the most important thing.

1049
01:30:43,232 --> 01:30:47,107
I am very nature as a turtle, like a tree,

1050
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:48,774
like a stone.

1051
01:32:05,778 --> 01:32:08,026
His gaze remains extraordinary.

1052
01:32:10,945 --> 01:32:12,861
It is very deep.

1053
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:16,027
I was up to me, I took a picture,

1054
01:32:16,153 --> 01:32:17,568
he put his finger in the mouth ...

1055
01:32:18,278 --> 01:32:21,776
He was looking for the first time in a mirror.

1056
01:32:21,902 --> 01:32:23,652
I was in front of him

1057
01:32:23,778 --> 01:32:26,652
and he removed his finger, put it.

1058
01:32:26,778 --> 01:32:28,570
He began to understand that it was him.

1059
01:32:28,696 --> 01:32:34,070
It was acknowledging his image. I felt completely identified.

1060
01:32:48,488 --> 01:32:50,570
It's a family like ours,

1061
01:32:50,696 --> 01:32:53,737
a grandfather, a father, children.

1062
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:59,320
They will respect each other, you know?

1063
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:04,321
And when you go, you have to respect their ways.

1064
01:33:04,446 --> 01:33:07,113
You have to sit in a particular way,

1065
01:33:07,239 --> 01:33:10,030
you have to respect their territory.

1066
01:33:10,155 --> 01:33:12,613
And then you receive.

1067
01:33:14,447 --> 01:33:17,571
I also became friends with a whale.

1068
01:33:22,823 --> 01:33:24,155
These are whales.

1069
01:33:25,698 --> 01:33:26,947
In Argentina.

1070
01:33:29,698 --> 01:33:33,322
An adult as this measures 35 meters and weighs 40 tons, more or less.

1071
01:33:34,572 --> 01:33:36,822
He was approaching, came to the ship.

1072
01:33:36,949 --> 01:33:39,072
I could touch it.

1073
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:41,864
And it was amazing. That skin so sensitive!

1074
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,530
While he is stroking,

1075
01:33:43,656 --> 01:33:48,072
He saw his tail shaking, at 35 meters.

1076
01:33:48,198 --> 01:33:49,615
A phenomenal sensitivity.

1077
01:33:50,449 --> 01:33:54,572
We had a small vessel of not more than seven meters.

1078
01:33:55,324 --> 01:33:57,948
I knew that if we looked strong, we could sink.

1079
01:33:58,074 --> 01:34:00,822
But he never touched the boat, never!

1080
01:34:00,949 --> 01:34:03,991
Sometimes he walked away and hit the sea with its tail.

1081
01:34:47,909 --> 01:34:52,575
Oh, it's another world, it's incredible.

1082
01:34:52,701 --> 01:34:57,408
I'll see if I have another photo here of the Nenets.

1083
01:34:58,577 --> 01:35:02,409
Check what does a Nenets.

1084
01:35:03,993 --> 01:35:05,368
It's your house.

1085
01:35:09,869 --> 01:35:13,618
I nenets this report with what was preparing a long time.

1086
01:35:14,577 --> 01:35:18,784
Were 18 people and about 6,000 reindeer

1087
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:21,410
They are living in constant migration.

1088
01:35:23,244 --> 01:35:26,243
Here should be the 7pm.

1089
01:35:26,369 --> 01:35:29,494
About 8 light a fire

1090
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:32,410
and make the only hot meal of the day.

1091
01:35:33,286 --> 01:35:36,660
After dinner, there are gatherings.

1092
01:35:36,786 --> 01:35:38,244
And the fire goes out.

1093
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:44,119
While the fire burning is the temperature is pleasant: 15-20 degrees.

1094
01:35:44,452 --> 01:35:47,078
Two hours later, it is already 30 below zero.

1095
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,619
They are real cowboys of Siberia.

1096
01:35:53,745 --> 01:35:56,370
Always wear ties

1097
01:35:56,496 --> 01:35:59,661
around the neck, made of reindeer skin.

1098
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:05,411
They wear leather boots with silver fox.

1099
01:36:06,121 --> 01:36:09,746
Sleep with their boots. A boot lasts a lifetime.

1100
01:36:24,996 --> 01:36:28,204
The Obi is a very special river,

1101
01:36:28,331 --> 01:36:30,286
a large river in Siberia.

1102
01:36:31,205 --> 01:36:34,912
This is about 47 kilometers long.

1103
01:36:37,873 --> 01:36:42,122
When you pass the Obi, you enter the Arctic Circle.

1104
01:36:44,206 --> 01:36:46,622
We have no horizon line, we have nothing.

1105
01:36:46,748 --> 01:36:51,497
We are on a white plate on the size of the universe.

1106
01:37:03,498 --> 01:37:06,914
Genesis made Sebastião again travel the world

1107
01:37:07,289 --> 01:37:08,788
for nearly a decade.

1108
01:37:09,457 --> 01:37:14,082
It was to show nature, animals, places and people

1109
01:37:14,206 --> 01:37:17,039
They are living as the beginning of time.

1110
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:19,748
A more optimistic view of the same planet

1111
01:37:19,874 --> 01:37:24,998
Sebastião had looked hurt and destroyed.

1112
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:29,498
Genesis was to be his great work.

1113
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:31,874
A love letter to the planet.

1114
01:37:47,249 --> 01:37:50,331
Zo'é had representations in writings of the sixteenth century Jesuits

1115
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:53,916
Amazon coming and reported on a people

1116
01:37:54,042 --> 01:37:57,124
who wore a kind of tube in the lower lip.

1117
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:00,499
These Indians never been seen.

1118
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,958
We thought it was a fable

1119
01:38:03,084 --> 01:38:05,375
or an invention of the Jesuits,

1120
01:38:05,501 --> 01:38:07,916
until the end of the forties,

1121
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:10,458
when we contacted them again.

1122
01:38:11,042 --> 01:38:15,166
Estado de Paré, Brasil Tribe Zoe, 2009

1123
01:39:40,337 --> 01:39:42,712
These Indians live in paradise.

1124
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,129
The only place I've seen in my life

1125
01:39:46,255 --> 01:39:49,462
where women have 3, 4 or 5 husbands

1126
01:39:50,046 --> 01:39:52,587
and many other women's husbands.

1127
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,920
The woman has a husband hunter,

1128
01:39:56,422 --> 01:39:58,087
un fisherman husband,

1129
01:39:58,588 --> 01:40:02,045
a husband who works a little agriculture

1130
01:40:02,255 --> 01:40:06,420
a husband who is close to home and helps you do all ...

1131
01:40:06,631 --> 01:40:08,963
Women have tremendous power.

1132
01:40:09,089 --> 01:40:12,921
Have dominion over from men,

1133
01:40:13,047 --> 01:40:14,670
bastante considerable.

1134
01:40:47,423 --> 01:40:51,631
Something that has always seemed very interesting to these peoples

1135
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,631
It is that the people had a full awareness of their image.

1136
01:40:56,257 --> 01:40:58,257
When I was going to take a picture,

1137
01:40:58,883 --> 01:41:02,715
the person knew I was going to represent your image

1138
01:41:03,717 --> 01:41:06,923
At first they were somewhat interested, then let them be interested.

1139
01:41:08,508 --> 01:41:10,548
It was not his world.

1140
01:41:10,758 --> 01:41:14,132
However, I was very interested in my knife.

1141
01:41:14,424 --> 01:41:19,048
YPO my friend made me swear I'd give my knife.

1142
01:41:19,174 --> 01:41:21,466
But the head of the FNI

1143
01:41:21,925 --> 01:41:25,508
had made me promise not to give them anything,

1144
01:41:25,634 --> 01:41:28,883
to protect the purity of these Indians.

1145
01:41:29,509 --> 01:41:31,758
I said, "Look, we make a deal.

1146
01:41:32,092 --> 01:41:36,591
The day that you go and strip the knife out the window of the plane.

1147
01:41:36,717 --> 01:41:39,259
I will follow the path of the plane

1148
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:41,299
and I find the knife. "

1149
01:41:59,634 --> 01:42:02,010
These plants are very old.

1150
01:42:02,219 --> 01:42:04,968
They are between 40 and 50 years.

1151
01:42:09,427 --> 01:42:11,634
The wonderful plants ...

1152
01:42:12,676 --> 01:42:14,175
ferns.

1153
01:42:14,344 --> 01:42:18,593
A shade plant, which grows in the middle of the jungle,

1154
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:21,010
in the highest parts, here.

1155
01:42:22,495 --> 01:42:24,510
Hair reminds me of my mother.

1156
01:42:24,637 --> 01:42:27,260
My mother was a beautiful woman. Lot.

1157
01:42:30,094 --> 01:42:32,676
Those were your plants. When she died,

1158
01:42:33,803 --> 01:42:36,677
my father cared for him until he died.

1159
01:42:36,802 --> 01:42:39,135
After the we brought us.

1160
01:42:45,012 --> 01:42:46,720
Look, it's raining.

1161
01:42:47,095 --> 01:42:48,176
How pretty.

1162
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:10,428
That land is very important to us.

1163
01:43:10,971 --> 01:43:14,303
We are closing a cycle with this land

1164
01:43:15,013 --> 01:43:18,679
and during that cycle she spent our lives.

1165
01:43:18,805 --> 01:43:20,470
He spent the lives of my parents,

1166
01:43:21,201 --> 01:43:23,534
step the life of my sisters,

1167
01:43:23,888 --> 01:43:26,803
and much of my life.

1168
01:43:27,055 --> 01:43:31,888
And now turn to add our lives to this.

1169
01:43:32,014 --> 01:43:33,763
My life and Leila again.

1170
01:43:35,014 --> 01:43:37,346
It remains our history.

1171
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:41,304
It was part of my childhood and now it is my old age.

1172
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:42,804
And the day I die,

1173
01:43:42,930 --> 01:43:48,554
We leave here the forest there was a bit before my time.

1174
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,972
Therefore, you will complete a cycle.

1175
01:43:52,265 --> 01:43:54,430
It's the story of my life.

1176
01:44:15,974 --> 01:44:18,931
The man whose photographs have told us

1177
01:44:19,057 --> 01:44:21,140
thousands of stories about our planet,

1178
01:44:21,266 --> 01:44:23,473
It leaves us a great history and a great dream:

1179
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:25,681
the destruction of nature can be reversed.

1180
01:44:28,766 --> 01:44:33,557
More than a thousand fountains watering again "Terra Institute".

1181
01:44:33,683 --> 01:44:36,931
There are already planted 2.5 million trees.

1182
01:44:37,057 --> 01:44:39,598
The wildlife has returned, even jaguars.

1183
01:44:41,641 --> 01:44:44,932
The earth is no longer possession of Salgado,

1184
01:44:45,058 --> 01:44:47,349
now a national park that belongs to everyone.

1185
01:44:47,475 --> 01:44:51,474
Is the demonstration that devastated lands anywhere

1186
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,807
they can return to forest.
