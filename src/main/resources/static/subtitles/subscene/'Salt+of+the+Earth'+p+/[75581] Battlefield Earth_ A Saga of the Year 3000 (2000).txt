{3478}{3522}The entire tribe must not|be endangered. . .
{3527}{3585}. . .because of the defiance of|one person.
{3590}{3625}You must forget about him.
{3630}{3712}He was a wild spirit and this was|always to be his fate.
{3717}{3783}You talk as if he's already dead
{3941}{4021}Even if he does survive this time,|he's a greener. . .
{4026}{4086}. . .so set your sights elsewhere|for a husband.
{4091}{4151}I'll never set my sights elsewhere.
{4975}{5045}-This is all the medicine I could find.|-I'm sorry.
{5055}{5119}The gods took your father|in the night.
{5715}{5809}As long as we stay here, there'll|never be enough to eat. Never.
{5826}{5914}There may be other places|we could live where food is plentiful.
{5919}{6001}All it takes is one demon to follow|you back from the forbidden land.
{6006}{6045}Then we'd all be struck down.
{6051}{6086}Have you ever seen one?
{6091}{6122}Have you?
{6127}{6174}Has anyone here ever seen one?
{6185}{6209}A demon?
{6219}{6247}A monster!
{6252}{6281}A beast!
{6369}{6403}The stories are true.
{6433}{6470}The gods used to live here.
{6492}{6578}They watched over and protected man,|but man grew selfish. . .
{6583}{6634}. . .and cruel. So the gods left. . .
{6639}{6699}. . .allowing the demons|to descend from the sky.
{6829}{6917}As survivors, we must dedicate|our lives to pleasing the gods. . .
{6923}{7013}. . .so that one day they will come back|and drive away the demons.
{7031}{7106}That is our fate.
{7157}{7205}Only if you believe in fate.
{7767}{7805}I'm sorry. I can't take you.
{7810}{7858}I can't handle myself|as well as a man?
{7863}{7909}-No.|-You arrogant greener.
{7914}{7983}You can handle yourself|better than most men. . .
{7988}{8050}. . .which is why you need|to help the village.
{8179}{8261}Your mother gave this to me|before she died.
{8267}{8321}She hoped it'd be passed|to your children.
{8421}{8450}It's for good luck.
{8667}{8724}Don't let anything happen|to you out there.
{9768}{9788}Easy!
{9936}{9957}Easy!
{10601}{10652}So you're the beast|we're all afraid of.
{11285}{11324}Not a lot of meat on a dragon.
{11509}{11556}You have been fortunate in the hunt.
{11561}{11612}I hope you thanked the gods.
{11644}{11712}-A nonbeliever.|-I believe what I can see.
{11765}{11839}A nonbeliever, huh?|You from the caves?
{11844}{11905}Probably never seen a god.|Would you like to?
{11910}{11992}-What do you know about gods?|-We've seen gods. Rock and l.
{11998}{12035}You lying thieves.
{12136}{12162}Wait a minute.
{12188}{12228}Wait a minute, we're hunting.
{12233}{12283}No time to show you gods with no food.
{12288}{12373}We need food. We must hunt.|Nonbeliever.
{12460}{12485}Wait.
{12701}{12746}First you show me the god.
{12767}{12802}Then we eat.
{12991}{13016}Look.
{13032}{13073}Frozen ones.
{13078}{13164}The way to the great god village|is marked by these frozen ones.
{13182}{13267}When the gods left this world,|they ordered man not to look at them.
{13275}{13367}Those that disobeyed were|frozen in place for all of eternity.
{13373}{13446}When the gods lived here|they could fly through the air.
{13466}{13559}They'd drive chariots in front|of special caves with golden arches.
{13572}{13596}Golden.
{13601}{13663}And the food would magically appear.
{13668}{13694}Magic.
{13700}{13728}Here!
{13753}{13855}The gods weren't allowed to fall|in love with mortal women.
{13865}{13903}This one did. . .
{13908}{13980}. . .and was left behind,|frozen as punishment.
{14083}{14116}Are you sure this was a god?
{14122}{14181}I thought you said you believe|what you can see.
{14456}{14483}If you need proof. . .
{14488}{14580}. . .when the sun goes down, you can see|the rest of the gods in the sky.
{14589}{14630}They're the bright lights.
{14684}{14756}The evil beasts hunt in the dark.|We need to find shelter.
{14761}{14808}There's a cave over here.
{14940}{15034}Look at those poor bastards.|They really angered the gods.
{15041}{15067}Carlo.
{15084}{15115}Let's eat.
{15474}{15512}Go. Go.
{15889}{15916}What's a "greener"?
{15922}{15973}The grass is greener|on the other side.
{15991}{16077}Always looking for something better,|something out there.
{16082}{16112}Maybe she was right.
{16236}{16268}God stone.
{16304}{16331}Sharp.
{16365}{16413}No, you keep it. You keep it.
{16429}{16512}Where we're from, a good woman|is a hard thing to find.
{16517}{16598}So if you were stupid enough|to leave a good woman behind. . .
{16603}{16692}. . .why don't you tell me where she is|so I can go get her for myself?
{16697}{16721}No!
{17734}{17792}Forget about me.|Get out of here. I can't move!
{18121}{18144}No!
{18249}{18285}Oh, heavenly gods!
{22153}{22198}Don't breathe the air!
{22211}{22235}It's poison!
{22361}{22403}My chest is on fire!
{22629}{22681}It helps you breathe. Take it!
{22686}{22717}I can't!
{22819}{22861}Get off my brother.
{24509}{24552}-What's he saying?|-Don't know.
{26610}{26649}Who's responsible for allowing|him to run around?
{26655}{26675}He shot the wrangler.
{26781}{26874}I'm a little pressed for time.|Save the going-away jokes for later.
{26879}{26926}No joke, sir. I swear.
{26931}{26991}The man-animal|got ahold of this gun.
{27008}{27033}Really?
{27064}{27093}Show me.
{27117}{27137}Sir?
{27245}{27272}Reach for the gun.
{27277}{27318}But, sir, I might get shot.
{27324}{27404}Sure, you might. And I might|suddenly grow a third arm!
{27409}{27441}But it shot the wrangler.
{27447}{27519}Any report filed today|still has my name on it. . .
{27525}{27614}. . .and you are out of your skull-bone|if you think I'm going to write. . .
{27619}{27702}. . . "shot by a man-animal" as the|cause of death unless I see it!
{27707}{27765}If I obey your command,|I may get killed.
{27770}{27835}If you don't, it's a certainty|you will be killed.
{27860}{27887}Reach for the gun.
{28166}{28226}Well, I'll be damned.
{30205}{30274}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30329}{30376}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30935}{30990}It is a pleasure to see you,|Your Excellency.
{30995}{31075}I would be honored to expedite|your clearance through security.
{31080}{31162}Please, call me Zete.|Does all of Earth look like this?
{31167}{31217}I'm afraid so, sir.
{31232}{31337}Pathetic. All the green|and the blue sky.
{31344}{31433}They told me this planet was ugly,|but this is one of the ugliest. . .
{31438}{31507}-. . .in the entire universe.|-I couldn't agree more.
{31512}{31618}I hate these puny, undersized planets.|The gravity is so different.
{31626}{31666}One does get used to it.
{31672}{31744}And the human-animals,|grossly undersized.
{31750}{31808}They don't make good eating,|Your Excellency.
{31814}{31870}-My executive assistant, Ker.|-Thank you.
{31876}{31968}He has been fully trained|to replace me as chief of security.
{31974}{32063}-As soon as my transfer goes through.|-Well, Ker. . .
{32068}{32149}. . .once we finish mining out|this miserable little planet. . .
{32154}{32200}. . .Iet's do the universe a favor.
{32205}{32263}Let's exterminate the lot of them.
{32332}{32392}-Oh, you're too much.|-So they tell me.
{32398}{32443}Please, come this way.
{32548}{32592}Spy satellites recorded those.
{32598}{32676}-What is this species?|-According to the Clinko historians. . .
{32681}{32720}. . .the species is called "dog. "
{32726}{32767}-Dog.|-Yes.
{32777}{32856}Obviously the superior race,|having the man-animal chauffeur.
{32878}{32977}Well, dogs did prove to be|more cooperative than the man-animals.
{32982}{33059}They weren't as useful|when it came to manual labor.
{33116}{33202}I am honored by your visit,|Your Excellency.
{33207}{33235}Thank you, Planetship.
{33240}{33316}You'll be pleased. I approved|additional labor resources.
{33321}{33378}They'll be here|by the end of quarter cycle.
{33383}{33424}Thank you, Your Excellency.
{33434}{33478}Now, let's see.
{33552}{33609}Your long overdue transfer.
{33622}{33719}You must be looking forward to getting|off this disgusting excuse of a planet.
{33725}{33823}I just want to do whatever serves|the corporation best, sir.
{33828}{33894}Very admirable.|And I must say, you've done. . .
{33900}{33970}. . .a first-rate job here|as interim security chief.
{33975}{34030}Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
{34035}{34072}I do what I can.
{34077}{34150}So we've decided to keep you|for another tour of service.
{34261}{34311}There must be some mistake.
{34316}{34383}Home Office does not make mistakes.
{34388}{34444}Of course not.|But have you looked at my file?
{34459}{34541}It explicitly says that this|is a temporary assignment.
{34688}{34768}Are you not aware that I graduated|top of my class?
{34773}{34805}Quite an accomplishment.
{34816}{34886}I don't mean to second-guess|the Home Office. . .
{34891}{34952}. . .but surely I could be|of better service--
{34957}{35072}Home Office is well aware of your|academic achievements and talents.
{35077}{35184}That's why we've decided not to keep|you here for another five cycles.
{35313}{35349}It's a joke.
{35409}{35433}Thank you, sir.
{35438}{35524}I don't know if I|could've kept my sanity. . .
{35529}{35576}. . .to be here another five cycles.
{35581}{35673}We've decided to keep you here|for another 50 cycles!
{35708}{35767}With endless options for renewal!
{36364}{36424}Those options, of course. . .
{36429}{36487}. . .being at Home Office's discretion.
{36492}{36522}Not yours.
{36569}{36602}The senator. . .
{36640}{36693}. . .has a lot of friends.
{36843}{36894}Would you please tell the senator. . .
{36900}{36969}. . .if I'd had even an inkling that|that was his daughter--
{36975}{37010}Watch your tongue.
{37064}{37151}The senator's exact words to me were,|and I'm quoting:
{37156}{37224}"If that blasted Terl tries|to talk his way out of it. . .
{37229}{37285}. . .have him vaporized on the spot. "
{37333}{37425}But cheer up.|There's one bright side to this.
{37430}{37522}One day you're going to die,|and when you end up in hell. . .
{37535}{37605}. . .at least it'll be a step up|from this place.
{38964}{39012}You haven't left for Psychlo.
{39026}{39116}Your powers of observation|are simply startling.
{39128}{39166}Give me three pans to go.
{39230}{39288}I don't know what|you're so down about.
{39300}{39352}You still get to be head of security.
{39357}{39476}Which, from what I can tell,|is a pretty cushy job.
{39484}{39548}Well, I can assure you. . .
{39553}{39672}. . .that I was not groomed since birth|to have some cushy job. . .
{39677}{39747}. . .that even a moron like you|could perform.
{39767}{39851}While you were still learning|how to spell your name. . .
{39856}{39947}. . .I was being trained|to conquer galaxies!
{39997}{40029}To do anything less. . .
{40034}{40109}. . .is a disgrace|to my entire family line.
{40143}{40182}That'll be six credits.
{40190}{40222}Put it on my tab.
{40227}{40253}You don't have a tab.
{40263}{40297}I do now.
{41271}{41333}You're new here,|so I'll explain how it works.
{41360}{41390}I eat first.
{41396}{41430}Then my men eat.
{41436}{41509}If there's anything left,|you can share it with them.
{41518}{41565}That's how it used to work.
{41581}{41641}Greener, let's just stay alive.
{41647}{41671}You're right.
{41678}{41710}-So I'll fight you.|-No.
{41738}{41802}Without food,|we don't have strength to escape.
{41807}{41868}-So now we're escaping?|-I am.
{41873}{41897}Come if you want.
{41989}{42048}We fight, it's to the death.
{42590}{42632}Say your prayers to the gods!
{43324}{43417}We have enough problems without|killing each other over food.
{43477}{43569}From now on, we eat at the same time.
{44427}{44454}Sir.
{44569}{44618}I was wondering when|you'd look at that.
{44632}{44741}It came in last week,|and I put it right in your box.
{44812}{44883}I've wasted my time, haven't l?
{44930}{45025}If you're going to lie to me, have|the decency to do a credible job. . .
{45030}{45094}. . .so I don't look like an idiot|for training you.
{45100}{45199}But I'm not lying. I put the photo|in your box as soon as it came in.
{45204}{45284}You are pathetic. You wouldn't last|one day at the academy.
{45289}{45366}-And I saw you.|-What?
{45455}{45488}You said:
{45498}{45578}"We use picto-cameras|to spy on other offices.
{45583}{45681}But under no circumstance|do we spy on our own office. "
{45686}{45740}That's right. We don't. I do.
{45760}{45798}Start talking.
{45840}{45889}The photo's from|last week's recon drone.
{45894}{45973}It shows a rockslide in the mountains.|It exposed a gold vein.
{45978}{46027}You were waiting for me to transfer. . .
{46032}{46084}. . .so you could turn it in|and get credit.
{46089}{46121}I didn't think you'd mind.
{46126}{46198}I don't mind. Turn it in. But before|you do, pretend you're not. . .
{46250}{46268}. . .a complete imbecile. . .
{46273}{46312}. . .and check the compo gradients.
{46410}{46462}It's full of uranium. No Psychlo. . .
{46514}{46585}. . .can get there without his breath gas|exploding. No way to mine the gold.
{46674}{46774}But what I do mind is that you|betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!
{46806}{46848}It's worthless! You said so!
{46853}{46912}But you didn't know it was worthless!
{47052}{47112}I would never hurt you, sir.
{47176}{47293}I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me.|It's against regulations, sir.
{47314}{47398}I can make this up to you, sir.|I promise. I swear.
{47403}{47430}Please, sir.
{47508}{47560}You do not have to shoot me, sir.
{47786}{47880}Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?
{47885}{47944}Of course not.|We have work to do. Come.
{47990}{48084}Tomorrow morning, we must warn|the Planetship of the mutiny.
{48089}{48113}What mutiny?
{48118}{48186}The one you're going to pretend|is in the works. . .
{48191}{48293}. . .Iike your life depended on it.|Because it does.
{48325}{48408}If the worker revolt takes place,|my informants tell me. . .
{48413}{48493}. . .that the first order of business is|to separate you from your head.
{48533}{48610}Which is why there will be no revolt.
{48615}{48709}I am authorizing you to use whatever|means necessary to prevent it.
{48721}{48826}The best way is to increase profits|and stop cutting the workers' pay.
{48831}{48883}Production equals profits.
{48894}{48978}And I've already ordered|as many new workers as possible. . .
{48983}{49020}. . .to boost production.
{49025}{49089}But we have to pay the new workers.
{49094}{49212}Maybe you were absent the day they|taught economics at the academy, Ker.
{49222}{49278}But nobody works for free.
{49291}{49330}Man-animals do.
{49381}{49440}What if we were to train them|how to mine?
{49561}{49635}Man-animals operating machinery?
{49657}{49714}Have you blown a head gasket?
{49725}{49839}I will be the laughingstock|of the universe.
{49844}{49898}So you should have me|take man-animals. . .
{49903}{49957}. . .with equipment,|out to a remote area. . .
{49962}{50037}. . .better that you don't know where,|and try and train them.
{50049}{50112}Have them do some test mining.
{50117}{50180}If it doesn't work out,|no one will know.
{50185}{50235}-Right.|-And if it does work. . .
{50240}{50292}. . .I will be vaporized.
{50298}{50339}It is against the law.
{50344}{50373}Regulations say. . .
{50378}{50479}. . .a Planetship faced with|a profit-threatening situation. . .
{50484}{50563}. . .is relieved|of all other ordinances. . .
{50568}{50673}. . .to pursue, to protect|and to acquire said profits.
{50678}{50705}There you have it.
{50881}{50950}We stick to the original plan.
{50968}{51006}Bring in new workers. . .
{51025}{51103}. . .and they go on half-pay|as soon as they arrive.
{51108}{51177}And that is final!
{52692}{52760}Run! Run!
{54071}{54132}Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.
{54241}{54313}Last time we didn't even stop timing|until its lungs burst.
{54319}{54343}That's the wager.
{54501}{54592}No way this man-animal|lasts more than four minutes.
{55147}{55177}Help me!
{55194}{55223}I need your air!
{55606}{55659}The wager's off.|The damn thing cheated.
{55860}{55913}The Planetship is hiding something.
{55918}{55975}All we have to do|is find out what it is. . .
{55981}{56026}. . .then we'll have leverage.
{56032}{56086}And then we can get the gold.
{56092}{56143}What do you mean, we? It's my plan.
{56153}{56252}I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then|I'm getting off this stinking planet.
{56258}{56287}Come on, sir.
{56302}{56343}You gotta let me in on it.
{56349}{56410}I barely make any lousy credits|in this job.
{56416}{56492}And I've got five wives|to support, sir.
{56550}{56630}I don't know if I want|to partner up with an idiot.
{56649}{56706}How do I even know|you understand the plan?
{56826}{56929}We train man-animals|who don't need breath gas. . .
{56935}{56986}. . .to mine the gold for us.
{56992}{57072}But Home Planet owns this planet.|The gold belongs to them.
{57078}{57111}That's the beauty of it.
{57117}{57171}Home Planet doesn't know|the gold exists.
{57177}{57245}Those corporate crapheads|won't know we stole it.
{57254}{57299}It's the perfect crime, sir.
{57305}{57404}Putting aside the serious violations|of teaching mining to inferiors. . .
{57410}{57503}. . .and insulting corporate superiors,|each one punishable by death.
{57509}{57554}So it is my duty to report you. . .
{57559}{57651}. . .though you'll be vaporized, and|I'll have to train a new assistant.
{57678}{57729}But it's your stinking plan, sir.
{57734}{57787}So I'm glad I have|a recording of you. . .
{57792}{57843}. . .Iaying out the plan|and my reprimanding you.
{57848}{57897}Think of it as part of your education.
{57939}{57968}Education, huh?
{58038}{58137}Never engage in a criminal activity|unless you have a patsy to pin it on. . .
{58143}{58192}. . .in case you ever get found out.
{58207}{58262}Thank you. That's great.
{58268}{58315}But why do I have to be the patsy?
{58321}{58381}So you don't get any bright ideas|to get rid of Terl. . .
{58387}{58436}. . .and keep the gold for yourself.
{58441}{58482}But I'd never double-cross you.
{58488}{58577}I've arranged that if any unfortunate|accident were to befall me. . .
{58594}{58662}. . .this would go|straight to the Home Office.
{60541}{60615}Double or nothing|I can blow off one of its limbs.
{60781}{60863}That one does seem to be unusually|intelligent and resourceful.
{60873}{60922}But it's also defiant.
{60931}{60972}We'll need leverage over it.
{60977}{61030}Leverage? Over a man-animal?
{61035}{61082}Man is a primitive species. . .
{61087}{61200}. . .so we'll need something primitive|for leverage. Like food.
{61210}{61276}What do you think a man-animal|would like to eat?
{61281}{61328}What would he consider a treat?
{61334}{61379}How the crap should I know?
{61399}{61436}There's no way of knowing that.
{61475}{61526}But before we educate it|on the machine. . .
{61531}{61611}. . .we'll take it to the mountains|with a couple of the others.
{61617}{61664}Let them think they've escaped. . .
{61677}{61757}. . .and then we'll sit back|and watch it choose its favorite food.
{61778}{61806}Yes.
{62282}{62308}Look!
{62512}{62598}Three days, and they still haven't|eaten anything yet.
{62604}{62664}Precisely. Now that|the man-animals feel. . .
{62671}{62720}. . .that they have|enough distance from us. . .
{62726}{62800}. . .soon they'll find|their favorite food and celebrate.
{63103}{63125}What is it?
{63132}{63165}Food. Food!
{63342}{63424}No spark, no flints, nothing.|You, Floyd?
{63430}{63487}Plenty to burn.|Nothing to start a fire with.
{63630}{63684}-That's their favorite.|-Of course it is.
{63690}{63764}-They could've selected anything.|-It's not cooked.
{63792}{63889}If man-animal prefers rat uncooked,|then our job is that much easier.
{63896}{63976}If they like their rat so much,|how come those two aren't eating?
{63981}{64088}Don't you know anything? The leader|of the pack always eats first. See?
{64262}{64328}We're really going to have|leverage over them now.
{64679}{64712}What are you doing?
{64966}{65003}They know about the camera.
{65008}{65051}Don't be a knot-head.|It's a man-animal.
{65062}{65111}It couldn't possibly know about it.
{65278}{65329}You sure called that one, sir.
{65334}{65377}No way they know about the cameras.
{65382}{65448}Move your fat ass|and let's go round them up!
{65477}{65506}Crap, lousy ceiling!
{66137}{66187}Great. This is great.
{66451}{66476}What do we do now?
{66482}{66552}What are you thinking, Jonnie?|Don't even think about it.
{66557}{66646}You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie.|You wouldn't live the jump!
{66653}{66711}You can surrender and rot|in those cages.
{66717}{66766}That's your choice.|I'm not going back!
{66773}{66839}The monsters catch us,|they'll take us to the mines.
{67100}{67127}Run!
{67966}{68001}How do we know what he wants?
{68006}{68083}They made me do this before.|Follow me and you'll be fine.
{68344}{68388}Don't touch anything.
{68394}{68450}Get them mad,|think what they'll do to us.
{69100}{69180}Excuse me, but I am your instructor. . .
{69186}{69217}. . .if you'll forgive such arrogance. . .
{69270}{69303}. . .for I do not have the honor|to be a Psychlo.
{69310}{69343}I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.
{69409}{69521}As you are listening to me,|I most likely do not exist. . .
{69527}{69624}. . .as we may have been exterminated|like many other races. . .
{69630}{69700}. . .by the gas drones|of our conquerors.
{69708}{69759}Please forgive my pretension. . .
{69765}{69842}. . .as I try to educate you|in Psychlo. . .
{69848}{69927}. . .the noble language|of our superiors.
{70933}{70961}You understand?
{70996}{71056}You understand me?
{71091}{71157}Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?
{71248}{71303}Obviously, this is going|to take a while.
{71812}{71857}Jonnie! Jonnie!
{71924}{71978}Carlo! Carlo!
{71992}{72077}I know who they are and where they're|from. I can speak their language.
{72083}{72128}-Monsters?|-They're called Psychlos.
{72134}{72165}What did they do to him?
{72172}{72234}They made him look into a light,|a god machine.
{72240}{72293}It teaches.|It's a knowledge machine.
{72300}{72392}It sends pictures through your head|so fast, it's spinning.
{72399}{72439}Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.
{72446}{72549}No, I can't. I have to stay.|I have to learn more about them.
{72576}{72645}This may be our only way out of here.
{73024}{73110}So this is the monster's language?
{73115}{73161}No, no. This is mathematics.
{73213}{73279}This is the unifying language|of the entire universe.
{73418}{73445}Look.
{73455}{73516}This symbol is called a triangle.
{73525}{73585}If all these sides are equal. . .
{73590}{73651}. . .then these three angles|must also be equal.
{73680}{73705}Equal to what?
{73720}{73748}To each other.
{73754}{73829}It's the basic foundation|of Euclidean geometry.
{73853}{73897}Seems pretty hard to understand.
{73910}{73989}No, only at first. And then it|becomes clear in your mind.
{73995}{74043}I learned molecular biology.
{74049}{74150}This is the symbol for water|and engineering.
{74164}{74274}See, a wing, see? And line|and form and artistic composition.
{74291}{74347}You see, this is a square,|like a cage.
{74352}{74456}I thought we were supposed to be|working on stuff to help us escape.
{74512}{74545}This will.
{74566}{74601}All this will.
{74963}{75029}Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.
{75108}{75188}"The security chief should secure|the field vault. . .
{75193}{75266}. . .with an eight-digit|combination code. . .
{75287}{75372}. . .and do not use a personal|or employee. . .
{75377}{75410}. . .identification number. "
{75415}{75464}What's an identification number?
{75474}{75498}There.
{75503}{75549}-How many numbers is that?|-Eight.
{75557}{75581}Eight?
{75599}{75631}Eight.
{75828}{75872}It's more clever than that.
{75877}{75917}The question is, how clever?
{75928}{75973}Try the numbers backwards.
{76327}{76357}Look at this.
{76362}{76405}It's a recording machine.
{76581}{76628}This is how he watches us.
{77331}{77376}Stop! Chrissy, stop!
{77397}{77424}What if he's not dead?
{77429}{77496}Hope is an admirable quality,|but foolish isn't.
{77501}{77570}I can't give you permission|to go and get killed.
{77583}{77616}I don't need your permission.
{77683}{77727}I'm no longer a child.
{78108}{78149}Do you want lunch?
{78384}{78449}It's obviously too much|to ask a man-animal. . .
{78454}{78510}. . .to learn a language|as sophisticated as Psychlo.
{78515}{78593}What if it can understand|and it's pretending it can't?
{78598}{78649}-What the hell for?|-I don't know.
{78654}{78738}Maybe it's secretly listening,|trying to get leverage over on us.
{78750}{78835}Man-animal getting leverage over|a Psychlo. That'll be the day.
{78877}{78945}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{78950}{78992}Maybe we should train another one.
{79004}{79052}No time. When they detect the gold. . .
{79057}{79118}. . .the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{79212}{79280}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{79533}{79559}It speaks Psychlo.
{79564}{79604}Go on, say something else.
{79613}{79660}You'll stay here as my prisoner. . .
{79665}{79732}. . .while you, you go|and get a transporter.
{79752}{79820}Because you've learned Psychlo|doesn't mean you are one.
{79825}{79877}Follow my orders|or I'll have you killed.
{79960}{80006}How exactly do you plan to do that?
{80259}{80308}-Mickey, no!|-Mickey, no!
{80339}{80447}If any of you rat-brains|knew anything about firearms. . .
{80462}{80549}. . .you would know that you never|store loaded weapons.
{80554}{80587}You drop him now!
{80596}{80656}Drop him or I won't mine|an ounce of your gold.
{80676}{80759}I'll have you vaporized|and find someone else to mine it.
{80764}{80790}You don't have time.
{80800}{80856}You can't hide this|from Home Office forever.
{80904}{81000}A man getting leverage over a Psychlo.|That'll be the day.
{81149}{81262}I think it's time that we show|our little friend a thing or two.
{81905}{81960}As long as you cling to|the feeble hope. . .
{81965}{82011}. . .that you'll ever get|the better of me. . .
{82016}{82086}. . .you'll be distracted|from more important things.
{82091}{82137}Which is exactly why. . .
{82142}{82197}. . .I share the following with you:
{82233}{82277}When we attacked your planet. . .
{82298}{82393}. . .all your soldiers and all|their advanced technology. . .
{82402}{82454}. . .could only put up|a nine-minute fight. . .
{82459}{82507}. . .before they were exterminated.
{82530}{82620}Which is why man|is an endangered species.
{82661}{82725}Everything you humans knew is here.
{82730}{82780}You can look at anything you want. . .
{82800}{82869}. . .because there is nothing|that will help you.
{83672}{83703}Satisfied?
{83716}{83743}Yes.
{83762}{83836}I have one more demonstration|for you and your friends.
{84113}{84176}You will be relocated|to a new mining site.
{84181}{84252}If any of you get any bright ideas|about escaping. . .
{84257}{84358}. . .keep in mind that although you|know nothing about firearms, I do.
{84369}{84485}I graduated top marksman in my class.|I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.
{84490}{84525}Tell them what I said.
{84530}{84573}We try to run, he'll kill us.
{84585}{84643}-That's it?|-Yes.
{84665}{84702}Allow me to demonstrate.
{85122}{85155}No! Wait!
{85569}{85626}Let's give this demon|what it deserves.
{85631}{85686}Kill it, I say! Destroy it!
{85691}{85740}Shoot! Shoot!
{85745}{85770}Why wait? Kill it!
{85776}{85811}Kill it. Then we'll run.
{85816}{85847}Then what?
{85855}{85942}What kind of life is it to run?|Living in fear of being hunted?
{85958}{86012}What about those we're leaving behind?
{86017}{86060}There's nothing we can do.
{86065}{86103}Only the gods can free them.
{86108}{86192}You think the lights in the sky|are gods waiting to save us?
{86198}{86306}Do you? Those are planets,|planets like this one.
{86311}{86359}The great villages were built by us.
{86375}{86423}By men and women just like us.
{86430}{86494}Willing to fight to the death|for one thing:
{86510}{86536}Their freedom!
{86541}{86601}Do you think no one has tried?
{86622}{86672}You can't defeat them.
{86793}{86851}That is our fate.
{86893}{86951}Yes, we can. Yes, we can!
{86965}{87002}But we have to go back.
{87007}{87062}We go back and learn|about their weapons.
{87083}{87151}Our race is slowly dying|and will be gone forever.
{87158}{87247}Let it be said that we took|this one chance and fought!
{87254}{87315}Are you with me? Are you with me?!
{87338}{87368}We fight!
{87404}{87479}If you're fighting the beast,|me and my men are with you.
{87484}{87557}Thank you.|It's good to have friends out here.
{87562}{87609}May the gods be with you.
{87750}{87822}One as wise as you has ways|to stop me from shooting.
{87831}{87900}I know if I'd tried,|you would've killed me first.
{88062}{88159}Damn right, rat-brain! That's the|first intelligent thing you've said.
{88191}{88239}Rest break is over.
{88253}{88341}There's something I need you to see|so you're properly motivated.
{88843}{88886}You don't know her?
{88923}{88981}No, I don't know her.
{89001}{89081}She's one of the foulest|looking females I've ever seen.
{89098}{89131}While I tend to agree. . .
{89150}{89255}. . .it's obvious that you show a lack|of aptitude for strategic deception.
{89260}{89369}On the other hand, what you show|marginal proficiency at is. . .
{89397}{89425}. . .drawing.
{89477}{89528}This was found when she was collected.
{89565}{89656}The collar has enough explosives|to remove her head from her body.
{89661}{89702}And this remote. . .
{89713}{89778}. . .will activate it|from anywhere on the planet.
{89783}{89860}So if you disobey me, let me|show you what will happen.
{89865}{89905}Please don't harm her.
{89929}{89958}I believe you.
{89963}{90020}Don't worry, rat-brain.
{90028}{90093}Every collar has its own frequency.
{90100}{90166}I'm not going to blow up|your little female friend.
{90218}{90250}Just. . .
{90300}{90327}. . .this one.
{90369}{90402}You made your point.
{90407}{90456}I said I would mine your gold.
{90472}{90515}Please don't kill him. Please.
{90613}{90641}Fine.
{90657}{90761}Due to our new working relationship,|I will grant you this one request.
{90799}{90834}I won't kill him.
{90850}{90913}But you may never ask of me|anything again.
{90926}{90954}I promise.
{91045}{91115}As I've said, I won't kill him.
{91120}{91145}Yes, sir.
{91576}{91616}Stupid humans.
{92279}{92322}No, no, no.
{92327}{92373}What you did was right.
{92385}{92423}It was right for all of us.
{92437}{92495}Greener, you're a thinker. . .
{92510}{92555}. . .and the gods respect thinkers.
{92568}{92612}You didn't kill Sammy.
{92633}{92698}Jonnie, this is not living.
{92716}{92768}This is. . .
{92787}{92807}. . .cages!
{92816}{92840}Cages!
{92845}{92929}Even if we escaped and went back|to where we all came from. . .
{92934}{92964}. . .it'd be like you said.
{92969}{93035}We'd be waiting for the Psychlos|to hunt us down.
{93047}{93122}I think that is not living either.
{93230}{93276}We all chose to fight.
{93895}{93959}-Count us in too!|-What's going on?
{93964}{94039}Someone knows how to speak|the Psychlo's language.
{94044}{94083}He's gonna help us fight.
{95424}{95466}Yes.
{95491}{95560}Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.
{95584}{95640}She's. . . .
{95645}{95697}His soon-to-be|newly acquired secretary.
{95702}{95757}-Yes.|-Really?
{95766}{95858}She's stupid enough not to be a menace,|pretty enough to be decorative.
{95863}{95965}She gets drunk with economical speed|and has other advantages.
{96037}{96073}I can see that.
{96079}{96142}-Don't you have some work to do?|-No.
{96147}{96167}Ker?
{96173}{96206}All right, sir.
{96269}{96308}Now, listen, missy. . .
{96313}{96388}. . .I'm still waiting for|the Planetship's accounts.
{96457}{96535}I had to go way beyond|the call of duty to get these.
{96540}{96616}I see. Well, that's why|I especially chose you.
{96628}{96682}So you'll keep your side|of the bargain?
{96702}{96745}Which was?
{96753}{96842}You said we'd have a huge house|when we go back to Psychlo next year.
{96848}{96905}-We're going to be rich, right?|-Right.
{96915}{97003}I am going to make you|as happy as a baby Psychlo. . .
{97008}{97075}. . .on a straight diet of Kerbango.
{97399}{97444}Well, isn't it interesting. . .
{97449}{97514}. . .that you have been keeping|two sets of books. . .
{97519}{97569}. . .and telling all the workers. . .
{97575}{97633}. . .that the planet has been|operating at a loss?
{97674}{97766}I only claimed that it was|running at a loss. . .
{97772}{97874}. . .to try and motivate them all|to work harder.
{97879}{97917}Oh, yes, of course.
{97927}{97980}And it had nothing to do|with the fact. . .
{97985}{98043}. . .that it allowed you|to cut the workers' pay. . .
{98049}{98124}. . .and keep all the extra credit|for yourself. Did it?
{98153}{98223}That. Well, I can explain that.
{98228}{98333}Well, unfortunately, the company|requires me to vaporize you.
{98374}{98399}On the other hand. . .
{98414}{98488}. . .I could understand someone|in your situation. . .
{98493}{98545}. . .being old and having no future. . .
{98551}{98622}. . .coming up with ways|to solve your financial problems.
{98651}{98714}-You can?|-Oh, yes.
{98722}{98782}It's really of no interest|to anybody. . .
{98787}{98844}. . .to have you not be Planetship.
{98850}{98947}But it would be prudent of you|to start to share your authority.
{99193}{99291}But these forms are|all blank, undated.
{99306}{99366}You could put anything|you wanted on them.
{99372}{99458}You would run the entire planet!
{99500}{99606}I would be nothing but a puppet.
{99622}{99685}Well, if you don't want|to do it that way. . .
{99690}{99741}. . .we could always do it by. . .
{99770}{99805}. . .the book.
{99958}{100057}What the hell does the Planetship|need with all this mining equipment?
{100062}{100105}That's not even the crazy part.
{100110}{100195}He's ordered me to take a group|of man-animals to a remote area. . .
{100200}{100279}. . .with the equipment to see|if they can be trained to mine.
{100284}{100361}Man-animals being able to mine?
{100366}{100395}Yes.
{100567}{100618}Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.
{100632}{100661}Indeed.
{100666}{100706}But what can I do?
{100711}{100757}An order is an order.
{100875}{100925}You have a busy day, rat-brain.
{100930}{100968}First, learning how to fly. . .
{100974}{101047}. . .then on to the learning machine|for mining techniques.
{101761}{101788}Crash one more time. . .
{101793}{101872}. . .and your little friend|will no longer be among the living.
{101882}{101904}Again.
{101909}{101945}Again!
{102948}{103031}Never underestimate what a little|leverage can do, rat-brain.
{103679}{103711}That's good, man-animal.
{103726}{103803}This is the lever where|we mine the gold!
{103808}{103859}Lever! Up, down!
{103891}{103975}Warning: External sensors indicate|dangerous radiation levels ahead.
{103980}{104023}This is as far as I can go!
{104028}{104062}Land it!
{104415}{104453}Meet me back here in 1 4 days.
{104458}{104510}I want the ship's cage|half-filled with gold.
{104632}{104698}And even though I won't be|at the mining site. . .
{104753}{104783}. . .I'll be watching you.
{105034}{105106}-How's your side?|-It's good. Good.
{105409}{105451}Next time, you fly.
{105728}{105798}No, no, no.|Even if we do mine enough gold. . .
{105803}{105875}. . .we'll be lucky to fill|half of that cage in time.
{105880}{105910}That's why we're not mining.
{105915}{106000}What about the big uglies watching|us with that eye in the sky?
{106005}{106060}Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?
{106065}{106124}We split them in half.|One group goes. . .
{106129}{106161}. . .and one group stays. . .
{106166}{106226}. . .and it looks as if|we're still working.
{106272}{106367}But if we don't deliver it in 1 4 days|to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.
{106373}{106426}There's a place called Fort Knox|where the gold's already been mined.
{106431}{106504}Listen, there will be no mining,|but we'll deliver it.
{106509}{106599}Okay, so we have to pretend|that we're mining the gold.
{106635}{106712}We have to figure out where|we're gonna get the gold. . .
{106717}{106778}. . .then we have to get the supplies|to help our revolt.
{106797}{106818}Yeah.
{106823}{106883}We barely have men to|do one of those things. . .
{106888}{106934}. . .Iet alone all three.
{106982}{107051}It's good to have friends|on the outside!
{107485}{107505}Come on!
{107510}{107578}If you two kept your eyes open,|that'd be a great help.
{107583}{107656}Look for an ocean. If you see any,|we've gone too far.
{107711}{107751}I think this is it.
{107756}{107799}I think we're in Washington.
{107804}{107868}-We're still in Colorado.|-That's impossible.
{107874}{107914}I've been watching,|we haven't crossed this line.
{107919}{107965}You're not paying attention.
{107971}{108060}Let him navigate and watch me.|You're gonna fly on the way back.
{108079}{108139}We couldn't have crossed|all these lines.
{108144}{108230}Well, we did. The lines must|have faded over time.
{108596}{108673}This great village was the capital|for all our tribes.
{108678}{108738}This is where our people's|history was buried.
{108988}{109059}Here. When the Psychlos|attacked Earth. . .
{109066}{109115}. . .they sent out flying gas drones.
{109121}{109208}Our ancestors must've made it out|into these remote radiated areas. . .
{109213}{109303}. . .and the only reason they survived|was because radiation is. . .
{109308}{109347}. . .Iethal to the Psychlos.
{109352}{109423}-And that was not good for them.|-That's good for us.
{109428}{109498}Even if we fail, the people|will be safe if they stay--
{109503}{109546}Safe from being hunted. . .
{109553}{109618}. . .but radiation is|also poisonous for humans.
{109641}{109683}So, you see, either way. . .
{109708}{109760}. . .if we don't take back our planet. . .
{109801}{109857}. . .the last of humanity|becomes extinct.
{110531}{110596}Based on what I've read about|Psychlo security. . .
{110601}{110630}. . .if we revolted. . .
{110635}{110714}. . .only using weapons they don't|perceive as any real threat. . .
{110719}{110779}. . .if we just use rocks and sticks. . .
{110784}{110859}. . .they'll just throw us|back in the cages.
{110864}{110893}But. . .
{110908}{110994}. . .we're gonna stage this revolt|inside the dome.
{110999}{111112}So the Psychlos are gonna have to|come inside the city to round us up.
{111127}{111200}And that is when we blow the dome.
{111228}{111268}Carlo's gonna blow the dome.
{111274}{111325}-They won't have masks.|-They can't breathe.
{111330}{111358}-They die.|-Carlo?
{111363}{111434}-I'm gonna blow the dome?|-You're gonna blow the dome.
{111472}{111547}Piece of cake.|Piece of cake, piece of cake.
{111636}{111699}But remember, as soon as|we blow the dome. . .
{111704}{111751}. . .boom, stage 2 alarm.
{111756}{111776}What is that?
{111781}{111858}Thousands of gas drones and troops|will be teleported here.
{111863}{111947}-We can't fight against that.|-Then what's the point?
{111952}{112032}If they send more monsters to Earth,|we get wiped out.
{112046}{112113}Well, the point is,|we don't let it get to stage 2.
{112118}{112180}We'll destroy their Home Planet|before it happens.
{112185}{112252}-Their Home Planet?|-Their Home Planet.
{112292}{112360}We need some extra supplies|before we can do that.
{112365}{112423}Our first stop is a radiation bomb|storage bunker.
{112428}{112485}Is everyone clear?
{112533}{112558}Count us in.
{113310}{113354}-Look.|-Flying machines.
{113359}{113437}These are flying machines.|They're weapons of some kind.
{113501}{113535}Flying spears.
{113543}{113597}I think there's a little more|to it than that.
{114018}{114060}It's a learning machine.
{114076}{114111}Teach us to fly.
{114564}{114590}You're right.
{114596}{114630}It's like breaking a horse.
{114648}{114700}Can you teach your men to fly this?
{114705}{114775}-Piece of cake, piece of cake.|-Piece of cake.
{114780}{114822}-Try and keep it level.|-Jonnie!
{114827}{114857}-What is it?|-I think I found one.
{114862}{114932}Come on! Nuclear firebomb!
{114937}{114969}Piece of cake.
{114994}{115056}According to the book, there's|a firing mechanism. . .
{115061}{115144}. . .that has to be in place before|it's operational.
{115637}{115680}Don't touch the auto-sensor.
{115685}{115722}What happens if we do?
{115727}{115793}The bomb will explode. Big fire.
{115831}{115879}Look. Greeners from this cave.
{115884}{115924}Off. Off.
{116305}{116326}War--
{116331}{116353}--ning.
{116358}{116400}Warning. Warning.
{116405}{116434}Warning.
{116456}{116502}Warning.
{116507}{116534}Get it?
{116661}{116723}What does the auto-sensor look like?
{116730}{116783}There's an illustration in Appendix A.
{116918}{116954}What? What?
{117043}{117078}We don't have Appendix A.
{117284}{117310}More books, Jonnie.
{117519}{117552}It's okay.
{117569}{117634}I thought you said nuclear fires|were powerful?
{117639}{117676}It's not nuclear. Mickey!
{117681}{117711}Sorry.
{117716}{117753}You're sorry. Mickey!
{117758}{117832}Stop touching things|and turn off the damn light.
{117837}{117861}Leave it on.
{117905}{117935}Look.
{118083}{118119}Good work, Mickey.
{118125}{118172}You just found Appendix A.
{118556}{118612}Will this be enough to blow up|their whole planet?
{118617}{118674}Radiation reacts with their|planet's atmosphere.
{118679}{118751}-There's enough to destroy it forever.|-Let me do it.
{118804}{118859}Let me go there|and detonate the weapon.
{118866}{118945}It's brave of you, Mickey,|but it's my plan, so I go.
{118950}{119024}You're the only one who speaks|the monsters' language.
{119029}{119077}You know things about them!
{119096}{119135}Listen. . .
{119140}{119205}. . .without you leading this revolt. . .
{119240}{119274}. . .we might not succeed.
{120516}{120602}I hope their eye in the sky didn't|see the gold through the lead walls.
{121054}{121107}Start filling the cage.
{121112}{121204}We'll hide half and deliver|the other half to Terl tonight.
{121681}{121718}Why is it in bars?
{121766}{121803}I assumed, sir. . .
{121808}{121904}. . .that a Psychlo of your refinement|wouldn't want raw ore.
{122002}{122034}Really?
{122311}{122362}Since you have had extra time. . .
{122367}{122417}. . .to smelt it into bricks. . .
{122422}{122486}. . .I'll expect the rest of the gold|in seven days.
{123198}{123258}He has no intention of sharing|that gold with you.
{123310}{123373}What the hell are you talking about?
{123403}{123471}Why are you here?|You should be mining the gold!
{123476}{123547}You really think the only reason|he made that recording. . .
{123552}{123626}. . .was to have you as his patsy?|Do you, Ker?
{123641}{123714}No. He has leverage over you. . .
{123719}{123782}. . .and it'll guarantee you|never see an ounce.
{123812}{123873}How do you know|about those recordings?
{123884}{123923}It really is amazing. . .
{123928}{123997}. . .the collection of discs|you find in Terl's personal vault.
{124373}{124396}First, we trade.
{124401}{124440}-The disc--|-I don't think so!
{124446}{124503}Because if you don't give me|the disc now. . .
{124508}{124549}. . .I will blow your head off.
{125046}{125084}You want to trade?
{125116}{125144}Let's trade.
{125175}{125205}Hooray!
{125260}{125317}Won't the Psychlo see|I'm not wearing the collar?
{125323}{125397}After tonight, won't matter|much either way.
{125429}{125494}Jonnie, I know you|don't believe in fate. . .
{125501}{125555}. . .but I've always known|this was your destiny.
{125564}{125636}This is our destiny.|It's freedom for all of us.
{125649}{125685}For our children.
{125719}{125750}Children?
{126330}{126360}Beautiful.
{126678}{126701}Quickly!
{127118}{127183}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{127188}{127248}There's no time.|When they detect the gold...
{127253}{127315}... the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{127424}{127503}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127547}{127642}When they detect the gold, the|Planetship will know what we're doing.
{127702}{127759}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127764}{127785}I've been thinking.
{127798}{127890}80/20 is a pretty fair|distribution of the gold.
{127907}{127949}But I should get the 80% .
{127968}{128050}And with my share, I'm gonna|fire all my wives. . .
{128056}{128091}. . .and buy new ones.
{128116}{128169}Maybe pretty ones this time.
{128198}{128225}Ker-bango!
{128280}{128308}Congratulations.
{128315}{128389}You've learned how to get|leverage over someone, haven't you?
{128408}{128481}Which means I haven't wasted my time|training you, have l?
{128500}{128546}-You're not upset?|-Don't be crazy.
{128555}{128603}You know how long I've waited|for this day?
{128609}{128660}I know the perfect way to celebrate.
{128709}{128764}What are you doing?
{128797}{128825}You can't shoot me.
{128830}{128904}I made a copy and gave it|to someone for safekeeping.
{128909}{128984}You are just too good of a teacher.
{129003}{129104}How about giving your old teacher|a clue as to who this might be?
{129109}{129159}You insult yourself, sir.
{129164}{129197}You taught me better.
{129202}{129255}How am I supposed to know who it is?
{129260}{129297}I don't know.
{129302}{129365}It could be anybody|on this damn planet.
{129371}{129419}-It could be a mechanic.|-No.
{129425}{129476}-It could be a concubine.|-No, no.
{129481}{129539}It could be anybody|in communications.
{129544}{129565}Wrong!
{129571}{129664}I hate these things. It's like|it's a test I'm not prepared for.
{129699}{129812}Well, hell, it could even be|our friendly bartender!
{129948}{130001}Please. I made a mistake.
{130118}{130173}Now, give me the original disc. . .
{130178}{130259}. . .then meet me at the teleportation|platform in two hours.
{130288}{130322}Sir.
{130573}{130611}The control bunker's to the right.
{130621}{130644}Three guards left.
{130652}{130721}Two from the guardhouse,|one coming from the north.
{130740}{130778}I'll take the guardhouse.
{132317}{132384}Jonnie, the shooting's|triggered the alarm.
{132402}{132485}Five guards from the south,|heavily armed and moving fast.
{132492}{132526}Between you and the bunker.
{132538}{132567}Jonnie!
{134147}{134229}The man-animals have escaped.|They're running into the city.
{134236}{134309}Send some guards out|and round them up. I'm busy.
{134314}{134372}Don't bother me|with every little detail.
{134377}{134412}Gotta round them up.
{134691}{134717}Psychlos!
{134751}{134782}Psychlos!
{134828}{134875}7-7-3.
{134915}{134998}Greener? Carlo. Explosives are set.|Can I blow the dome?
{135048}{135073}Greener?
{135086}{135134}What's going on? Talk to me!
{135139}{135201}It's Carlo. What's going on?|Talk to me.
{135206}{135236}Hold on!
{135268}{135325}If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo,|they'll send drones.
{135330}{135410}Well, hurry up. Just hurry up,|because I've got company.
{139392}{139412}Here they are.
{140094}{140144}Panther!
{140664}{140723}Hang on. I'm right on his tail.
{141934}{141977}You know what you gotta do.
{142658}{142687}Greener, come on.
{142692}{142730}I've gotta blow this dome now!
{142735}{142791}I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb.|Hang on.
{142798}{142829}I'm seconds away.
{143141}{143166}Jonnie, come on.
{143172}{143215}They're destroying the bombs.
{143222}{143257}-It's now or never.|-Now!
{143262}{143326}Now, go ahead! Blow the dome!|Go! Go! Go!
{143486}{143553}Teleportation sequence terminated.
{143580}{143616}Interrupting something?
{143630}{143665}Jonnie? Jonnie?
{144460}{144513}Why isn't it coming down?
{144542}{144593}The dome is holding!
{144623}{144675}-It's not working.|-It's only cracked!
{144791}{144858}The dome isn 't broken.|We can 't hold out long.
{144929}{145007}Attention! This is Terl,|your chief of security.
{145025}{145102}Exterminate all man-animals at will.
{145107}{145143}And happy hunting!
{145478}{145525}Run! Run!
{146232}{146263}What's with the dome?
{146292}{146352}Hold on, I'm taking it out now.
{147354}{147388}Help us!
{147397}{147424}They're killing us!
{147615}{147696}We're not gonna make it!|I think we should pull out!
{148188}{148277}I'm blowing the dome. In five.
{148292}{148319}Four.
{148473}{148501}Three.
{148522}{148548}Two.
{148562}{148583}One.
{148635}{148672}Piece of cake.
{149356}{149411}Everyone on the ground now! Go!
{151457}{151521}Teleportation sequence activated.
{151568}{151634}Teleportation sequence activated.
{151649}{151719}Psychlo War Center,|this is a stage 3 alert!
{151725}{151775}I repeat, a stage 3 alert.
{151780}{151850}Initiate the gas drone|extermination sequence.
{152200}{152258}You have been|quite a challenge, rat-brain.
{152263}{152316}You'll make a hell|of a conversation piece. . .
{152322}{152400}. . .when you're stuffed|and hanging on the academy wall.
{153538}{153579}Where's the rest of my gold?
{153589}{153644}I'll exchange it for my woman's life.
{153660}{153738}My life is over, but hers is|of no consequence to you.
{153764}{153844}Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain.|Now, where is it?
{153849}{153904}Trust me, you don't want to do that.
{153910}{153967}Trust me, there's nothing I want more.
{156412}{156455}Carlo came through.
{157894}{157956}Why don't you vaporize me?
{158146}{158169}Leverage.
{158263}{158330}If there are other Psychlo|colonies out there. . .
{158335}{158404}. . .they'll send out gas drones|and exterminate us.
