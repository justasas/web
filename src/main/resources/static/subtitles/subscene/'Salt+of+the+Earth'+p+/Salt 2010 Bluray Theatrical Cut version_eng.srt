1
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:54,472
Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

2
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,100
I'm really not who you think I am.

3
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,061
Please. Please. I'm not a spy.

4
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,771
- You are a spy.
-I'm not a spy.

5
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,066
- Please let me go home.
-Try again.

6
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,943
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

7
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,071
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

8
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,657
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

9
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:16,911
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

10
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,998
I am not a spy! I am not a spy!

11
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,598
I am not a spy.

12
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,851
<i>I am not a spy.</i>

13
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:45,815
<i>It is through the grace and munificence
of our glorious Dear Leader...</i>

14
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,569
...that <i>the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea...</i>

15
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:53,323
<i>...has pardoned
the American imperialist...</i>

16
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,577
<i>...for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.</i>

17
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:01,289
Keep your head down. Don't say
anything till we make the swap.

18
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,084
In case Kim Jong ll here
changes his mind.

19
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,059
Exchange.

20
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,311
Right face!

21
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,649
Right face!

22
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,277
I don't understand.

23
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,696
You don't understand what?

24
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,368
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life...

25
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,287
...is not worth blowing
operational cover.

26
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:42,663
You got that right.

27
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:46,834
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good, we will.

28
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,044
So why did you do it?

29
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,048
Well, I didn't do it.

30
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,801
He did.

31
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,013
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

32
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,768
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

33
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,979
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something...

34
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:10,691
...or he's gonna invade this
goddamn rice-paddy republic himself.

35
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,252
You Okay?

36
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:32,839
Yeah.

37
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,634
H9)'-

38
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,597
- Good morning.
-Happy anniversary.

39
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,809
You want me to make you breakfast?

40
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,395
How about pancakes?

41
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,522
Your cooking?

42
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,691
You're joking. You like my cooking.

43
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,860
Germans don't joke.

44
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,988
Burt likes my cooking.

45
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,080
Get your bugs off the table.

46
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,333
- They're spiders.
-They're bugs.

47
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:53,377
- They're spiders.
-They're bugs.

48
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:02,345
<i>Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.</i>

49
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:06,098
<i>Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back...</i>

50
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,101
<i>...and over one another
about a third of the way.</i>

51
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,607
<i>Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.</i>

52
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,901
Are you doing this
on company time?

53
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:20,738
<i>- And insert your favourite silverware...
-it's</i> my <i>anniversary.</i>

54
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,242
And I want it to be perfect.

55
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,952
But...

56
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,620
...that is not sexy.

57
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,498
No, but it is utilitarian.

58
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,833
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

59
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,587
I ran the trace. First name Usam,
last name Utsaev.

60
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,256
- Any verifiable hits?
-One.

61
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,759
Hey, Francis, do me a favour and
stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

62
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,011
Mata Hari here's
got a big night tonight.

63
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,389
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

64
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,517
"Sir"? Do I look like a "sir" to you?

65
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:50,726
From head to toe.

66
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,021
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

67
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:58,359
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

68
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,237
Was I ever that young?

69
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,699
Younger.

70
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,201
Walk me out.

71
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,204
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

72
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,206
Oh, you know. The usual.

73
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,792
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia...

74
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,921
...the day before it happens. How about
you? I heard that interview went well.

75
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,798
Fingers crossed.

76
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,217
You sure about this?

77
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:26,345
You know, once you start pushing
paper, there's no turning back.

78
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:29,890
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

79
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,518
- I was homesick.
-Homesick?

80
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,021
- Sir! Sir!
-Can't you take something for that?

81
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,775
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

82
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,278
- Here?
-I guess he's not buying our cover.

83
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,447
- Did you get his bona fides?
-He's Russian.

84
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,741
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

85
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,118
- He's a strange guy.
-How's his English?

86
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,412
Passable. Not great.

87
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:54,457
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance...

88
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:58,252
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
-Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

89
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,462
Come on, Salt.

90
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,798
No one can sort out a nutjob
from the real thing faster than you.

91
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:06,010
- I got 25 minutes.
-I got 26. Let's go.

92
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,019
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

93
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,438
- Who called Counterintelligence?
-Not me.

94
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,232
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

95
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,236
- Peabody.
-Salt.

96
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,202
Please remove the hood.

97
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:33,913
Microphones are on.

98
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,040
Checking levels.

99
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,751
Baseline recorded.

100
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,966
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

101
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,221
- Ev.
-Yeah.

102
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,556
Commencing audio
and visual recording.

103
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,692
<i>Testing earpiece.</i>

104
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,239
Interview has commenced at 1442.

105
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,042
You're married.

106
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,588
A husband must be a distraction...

107
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,384
...for a female intelligence officer.

108
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,720
Well, we're here to talk about you.

109
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,054
So, what is your name?

110
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,599
My name is...

111
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:40,146
...Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

112
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,568
I have cancer.

113
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,778
I'm moved.

114
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,072
A defector with cancer.

115
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,285
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

116
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:59,123
If I have gained anything
by damning myself...

117
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,379
...it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

118
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,008
<i>Russia is also dying.</i>

119
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:12,595
<i>- But unlike me, she's not dead.</i>
- Oleg <i>Vassily Orlov...</i>

120
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:16,474
...shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

121
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,934
He was on Victor Baris0vsky's
staff there.

122
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,394
<i>He checks out as FSB, Ev.</i>

123
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,439
Scan says he's truthful
on the cancer.

124
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,024
Prior to '93?

125
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,486
<i>- Russia was once strong, powerful...
- Nothing.</i>

126
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:29,987
He doesn't exist.

127
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:33,908
<i>And she will be again
when things have been set back...</i>

128
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,076
...on the correct path.

129
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,038
I have somewhere I need to be,
Mr. Orlov...

130
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,791
...so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

131
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,172
I came here to tell you a stow.

132
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,883
I don't like stories.

133
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,844
But I'll listen anyway.

134
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,930
In English, please.

135
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,890
Others are listening.

136
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,811
1975.

137
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,522
The Cold War.

138
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,108
<i>In a gymnasium in Grozny...</i>

139
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,528
<i>...a Soviet Olympic wrestler...</i>

140
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:14,240
<i>...named Sasha Fyorodovich
Chenko v.</i> ..

141
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,325
<i>...meets for the first time...</i>

142
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:20,830
<i>...the only female chess grand master
of her era:</i>

143
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:25,709
<i>Anja Nurekyova.</i>

144
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,088
<i>Within a month, they were married.</i>

145
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:32,716
<i>And within a year, a child.</i>

146
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,302
One month more...

147
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,515
...the child was back
in the same hospital...

148
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,058
...sick with fever.

149
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,980
<i>And within days after that...</i>

150
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,733
<i>...the child suddenly was dead.</i>

151
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:55,781
<i>Yes, a child was dead.</i>

152
00:10:55,948 --> 00:11:00,160
<i>And, yes, a child was buried.</i>

153
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,921
<i>But the Chenkov baby was alive...</i>

154
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:15,467
<i>...and became the property
of another man.</i>

155
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:20,014
<i>A master spy who had
devised the greatest plan...</i>

156
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,518
<i>...a Russian patriot
could ever invent.</i>

157
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:29,023
<i>A plan to destroy America.</i>

158
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,650
<i>It had all started...</i>

159
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,779
...with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

160
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:40,075
<i>In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.</i>

161
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:43,162
<i>Three years later, he returned home.</i>

162
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,123
<i>But the man
who came back to America...</i>

163
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:51,754
<i>...was in fact a Russian spy
named Alek.</i>

164
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,674
<i>On November 22nd, 1963...</i>

165
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,594
<i>...Alek became the first success
of the new programme...</i>

166
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:04,058
<i>...and a hero of the Soviet Union.</i>

167
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,353
<i>The spymaster was now
given the go-ahead...</i>

168
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,356
<i>...to create many more like Alek.</i>

169
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,984
<i>Scores of agents,
males and females...</i>

170
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,779
<i>...to be substituted for Americans.</i>

171
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:20,616
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

172
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,952
<i>At an abandoned monastery...</i>

173
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,872
<i>...Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English...</i>

174
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,583
...long before they learned Russian.

175
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,877
Drilled in idiom...

176
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,296
<i>...idiosyncrasy and...</i>

177
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,590
...ideology.

178
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:43,013
<i>And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming...</i>

179
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,225
<i>...the spymaster
made warriors of iron.</i>

180
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:49,770
<i>Unquestioning and unbreakable.</i>

181
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,232
You're killing me, man.

182
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,609
When does the good fairy come in?

183
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,736
Never.

184
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,655
It's a story without hope.

185
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:04,827
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

186
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:08,539
There was an accident.
The family died.

187
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:11,667
Chenkov was sent to America...

188
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:15,212
...to live a complete lie...

189
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,258
...and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

190
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,468
Day X.

191
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:26,140
The long-awaited mission is here.

192
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,810
Chenkov will travel
to New York City...

193
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,729
...to kill the president of Russia...

194
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,148
...to kill the president of Russia...

195
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:39,903
...at the funeral of
the American vice president.

196
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:45,534
Chenkov is KA 12.

197
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,370
_llKA-ll
-Cold War legend.

198
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,372
Highly trained
Russian sleeper agents...

199
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:54,418
...inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

200
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:58,464
Supposedly they'd wait years
to strike. Decades, even.

201
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,591
supposedly.

202
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:03,802
- What, you don't believe in moles?
-I believe in moles, all right.

203
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,304
Just not the bogeyman.

204
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,432
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

205
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,517
This guy's selling smoke.

206
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,603
Wrap it up, Ev.

207
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:18,066
So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? Is that it?

208
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,778
0K8)'-

209
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,197
Thank you very much.

210
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,950
And what would you like
in return for that information?

211
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,828
I simply wish to help you do...

212
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,414
...what you need to do.

213
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,877
You're good.

214
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:41,757
The KA programme
is brilliant bullshit.

215
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,968
But I'm officially off duty...

216
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,764
...so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

217
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,016
- Salt.
-Yes?

218
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:55,521
The name of the Russian agent
is Salt.

219
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,148
Evelyn Salt.

220
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,487
My name is Evelyn Salt.

221
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,782
Then you are a Russian spy.

222
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,535
<i>Truthful.</i>

223
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:15,499
So far the fMRl scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

224
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,379
Ted?

225
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,679
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

226
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,515
- I need to get to the phone.
-Not after the neural scan.

227
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,476
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

228
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,603
I am trained to, and so is he.

229
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,398
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

230
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,150
- Let me call my husband.
-Let me see it.

231
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,740
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

232
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,701
They don't just blow up their cover...

233
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,370
...they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

234
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,164
- Do you remember Henley's wife?
-Yes, I do.

235
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:57,833
Speaker.

236
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,795
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks. Bye.</i>

237
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,673
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

238
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,884
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

239
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,386
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

240
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:14,558
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

241
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,227
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

242
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:21,189
- I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
-I didn't say you were.

243
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,483
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

244
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,737
No, no. We gotta go to
a secure location. Now.

245
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,196
All right.

246
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,074
Doesn't get any more secure
than this.

247
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,411
Ev? Five minutes.

248
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,249
- Call Protective Services, find Mike.
-I will.

249
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,585
This is bullshit.

250
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,424
Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

251
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,053
I know we're heading
into your jurisdiction.

252
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,013
- I'm just asking for five minutes.
-No.

253
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,981
If I have to. You can't have
five minutes. I have to talk to her.

254
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,567
- She's scared. Don't you see that?
-I don't care.

255
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:09,112
There is a mole in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. I am sure.

256
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,169
Please step in the elevator.

257
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,823
--Russian president, okay? So I'm
gonna ask you to step out of my way.

258
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,164
What the hell is that?

259
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,791
Sir.

260
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,161
<i>- Where do you think he went?
-No one saw him coming out the front.</i>

261
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,165
- Jesus Christ.
-Here he is again.

262
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,209
No sign of him so far on the street.

263
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,170
It's two minutes ago,
before lockdown.

264
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,964
- Anything clean on him?
-We just got a match, sir.

265
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,841
It's May Day, 1981.

266
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,218
There's Brezhnev. And there...

267
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,511
- Orlov.
-That's him.

268
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,556
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

269
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,808
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter...

270
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,020
...airport, train station, taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

271
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,356
- Get me Medford on a secure line.
-Yes, sir.

272
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,235
- Top-right screen. Is that live?
-Yes, sir.

273
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,779
Where is she going? Track her.

274
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,408

Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

277
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,586
- We lost the visual on her.
-Damn it. Where'd she go?

278
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,588
<i>We are on security lockdown.</i>

279
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,591
Dave? It's Evelyn, is Mike there?

280
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,094
<i>No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.</i>

281
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,845
<i>HEY, happy anniversary, huh?</i>

282
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,680
The stairwell.

283
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,391
- Second floor.
-What's on that floor?

284
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,228
-It's empty, a security buffer.
-isolate and seal it.

285
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,695
Get her records to my handheld.

286

293
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,029
- Yes, sir.
-Director Medford, sir.

294
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,031
Get me a side arm.

295
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,160
I'll call her back.

296
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,126

-Lost visual.

00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,473
<i>He's the perfect cover
to get us inside.</i>

346
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,764
Mike?

347
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,353
Mike? Honey?

348
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,736
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

349
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,863
It's all right.

350
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,200
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

351
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,067
Come on. Come on.

352
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,866
Check for back exits.

353
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,428
Go! GO!

354
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,684
Bedroom, clear!

355
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,062
Kitchen is clear.

356
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,858
Office, clear!

357
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,777
Living room, clear!

358
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,598
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

359
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,169
<i>Come here.</i>

360
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:15,755
What are you doing?

361
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,424
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

362
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,094
Did it ever occur to you that
that Russian was lying?

363
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,762
- Why'd she run?
-I don't know.

364
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:25,848
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

365
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,101
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

366
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,520
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

367
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,355
"Maybe" is your department.

368
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:35,191
Mine is catching her
so we can find out.

369
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:38,027
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

370
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,321
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

371
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:43,533
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

372
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,909
Should it?

373
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,747
- Is your mom home?
-No.

374
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,541
- No? Can you do me a favour?
-Yeah.

375
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,876
Hi. You babysit Burt for me?

376
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:58,047
- Oh, yeah.
-Yeah? Here's some money for food.

377
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,966
Hi, Burt.

378
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:04,137
- What you doing? You doing homework?
-Yeah, math.

379
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,974
- Algebra.
-I hate math.

380
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,946
Hi. Nice to see you again.

381
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:27,243
- You talking to me?
-Yeah, I've seen you here before.

382
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,078
Yeah, I do. I come here a lot.

383
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,290
<i>You'?</i>

384
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,126
Oh, I'm working here.

385
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,253
At the museum.

386
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:41,757
- I'm an arachnologist.
-A what?

387
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,427
<i>I hunt spiders.</i>

388
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,609
I got her.

389
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,528
<i>She's heading north
towards the Metro station.</i>

390
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,280
Ev!

391
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,181
Ev!

392
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,735
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

393
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,157
Excuse me.

394
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:02,922
<i>- Will do. Headed there now.</i>
- There <i>she is.</i>

395
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,176
All teams, southbound
toward the bridge. Box her in.

396
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,105
Circle around!

397
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,023
Salt! Stop!

398
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,484
- Keep her in your sights!
-Coming up behind you!

399
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,027
Fuck!

400
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,033
Keep back! Hold your fire!

401
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,411
Salt! Down!

402
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,706
Salt!

403
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,505
Spread out!

404
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,717
- Salt!
-Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

405
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,011
- On the ground. Now!
-Please don't. No!

406
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,222
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

407
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:54,599
I have to find my husband.

408
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,559
- Why'd you run?
-To find my husband!

409
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,519
- That's not a reason.
-Don't shoot.

410
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,062
- Stay back!
-Last chance.

411
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,732
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

412
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,234
- Don't make me put you down.
-Put the gun down!

413
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,944
- Give yourself up!
-Come on, Ev.

414
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,655
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, I promise.

415
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:13,075
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

416
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,870
Somebody's going to try to
kill the Russian president.

417
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,789
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

418
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,250
There's nowhere to run! Quit now!

419
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,752
No, I didn't do anything.

420
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,295
Get back! No!

421
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,930
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

422
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,932
Get a roadblock in place now.

423
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,946
<i>Metro Police on alert.</i>

424
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:32,154
There she is. On the tanker.

425
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,865
Stop. Stop!

426
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,794
Ev!

427
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:05,104
You, my friend, have got
a mole in your group.

428
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:08,524
- We don't know that yet.
-I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar...

429
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,402
...and everything she's said
has been to protect her cover.

430
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,196
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

431
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,041
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

432
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,645
Okay, take it down.

433
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:39,490
Shit!

434
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:43,828
Shit!

435
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,460
0K8)'-

436
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:54,255
Ted, I know you're her friend...

437
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,882
...but we gotta drop a net
on New York.

438
00:36:57,258 --> 00:37:00,135
- We gotta do it now.
-Let's go!

439
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:06,225
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

440
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,145
Tell them Salt might be
coming their way.

441
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,024
And if she is,
Orlov may not be far behind either.

442
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,071
You seen this?

443
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,657
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

444
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:26,120
She was in a car accident with
her parents in '88. They both died.

445
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:32,167
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy
for the American children of the staff.

446
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:35,296
That's why we put her on Russia
in the first place.

447
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,342
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

448
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:44,013
Send everything we've got on Orlov
to N.Y.P.D.

449
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,354
<i>And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up...</i>

450
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,148
<i>...and preparations are continuing
well into the night...</i>

451
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:39,401
<i>...for the funeral of
Vice President Maxwell Oates.</i>

452
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:44,114
<i>Among the dignitaries attending the
service at St. Bartholomew's Church...</i>

453
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,742
...is <i>Russian president
Boris Matveyev...</i>

454
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,411
<i>...who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.</i>

455
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:54,541
<i>Public transportation will experience
delays, with subway closures and...</i>

456
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,588
Evelyn.

457
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,799
Look at me.

458
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,637
If there was a way, I would kill them.

459
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,433
You shouldn't have come here.

460
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,144
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

461
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,023
Now they know who you are.

462
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,067
Who?

463
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,903
Evelyn.

464
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:25,948
Who?

465
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,285
I would accept anything about you...

466
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,204
...but I need to know.

467
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,457
So look at me. Look at me.

468
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,129
Just tell me, okay?

469
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:41,797
Just tell me.

470
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,051
I work...

471
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,971
I work for the CIA.

472
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,475
So you see, there's...

473
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,396
There's no future for us.

474
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,484
You're not safe with me.

475
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,988
I don't wanna be safe.

476
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,200
I know you...

477
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,036
...and I wanna be with you.

478
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,833
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.

479
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,295
Okay?

480
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:26,133
Okay. Okay.

481
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:50,073
Welcome to New York, Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

482
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,367
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

483
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,702
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

484
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:04,671
<i>- I'll</i> put these in the closet, sir?
- Yeah, fine.

485
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:42,311
A solemn day here in New York City.

486
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,397
The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates...

487
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:49,318
...a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold War warrior...

488
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,820
...whose greatest legacy
may be as architect...

489
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:55,324
...of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

490
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,492
Russian president Boris Matveyev...

491
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,412
<i>...has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer...</i>

492
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,833
<i>...to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the West.</i>

493
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:05,018
What's the security perimeter?

494
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:08,230
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

495
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:11,733
And those are Secret Service agents,
not CIA.

496
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,362
- So relax.
-That's real funny.

497
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:18,073
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

498
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,161
Detail, halt.

499
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:27,582
Forward, march.

500
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:48,854
<i>Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.</i>

501
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:57,738
<i>Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.</i>

502
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,118
What--? Hey, what's going on?

503
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,203
Hey! There's smoke.

504
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:10,500
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

505
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,287
Eleanor. Good to see you.

506
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,581
Thank you.

507
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,545
- Boris.
-Mr. President.

508
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,384
Hello.

509
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,606
Please be seated.

510
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:29,204
<i>Stand by for president's speech.</i>

511
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:35,377
<i>Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.</i>

512
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:38,130
Mrs. Oates.

513
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:43,301
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald...

514
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:47,556
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

515
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:50,934
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

516
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:59,901
I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.

517
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,362
As vice president...

518
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:07,075
...he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

519
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:08,869
And today...

520
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:13,790
...the world says goodbye
to a great man.

521
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:24,759
I'll check the back.

522
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:27,429
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

523
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,624
<i>My friendship with Maxwell Oates...</i>

524
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,793
...began in the unlikeliest of places:

525
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,464
<i>- Lima Zulu 4, come in.
-Across the negotiating table...</i>

526
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:04,799
<i>What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?</i>

527
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,176
We got two MIAs.

528
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:11,473
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel outside
the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

529
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,768
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

530
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,561
What's going on, guys? Talk to me.

531
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,856
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, <i>2</i> and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

532
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,107
<i>Converge on the crypt.</i>

533
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:23,318
He made all the difference,
and for that...

534
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:28,365
...he will always have
my respect and admiration.

535
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:17,163
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

536
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,130
What's going on?

537
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,517
Matveyev.

538
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:39,561
Get goddamn Matveyev.

539
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:57,370
- Get the bomb squad in here!
-Go, go!

540
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:38,787
Drop it!

541
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:41,831
Drop it!

542
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:52,050
- Any MTs down here?
-I see her.

543
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,969
- Keep your hands up!
-Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

544
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:58,390
- Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
-Don't move!

545
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,767
- Do not move! Do not move!
-Keep your hands up!

546
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:04,187
- Take her down, take her down!
-Check for other weapons.

547
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:07,607
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

548
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:09,567
I can't feel a pulse.

549
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,654
Back it up! Back it up!

550
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:15,782
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

551
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,201
Let's go, let's go.

552
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,412
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

553
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,621
- Back up!
-Keep moving.

554
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,039
Sir, back up!

555
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:25,792
Why? Why?!

556
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,255
- Take her down, take her down!
-Check for other weapons.

557
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:32,006
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

558
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,175
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark hole!

559
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:35,844
Get ahold of yourself.

560
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:38,012
Get the door, get the door.

561
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:40,849
- Get off me!
-Back off, man! Back off!

562
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,350
That's it. Let's go.

563
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,353
Stand back.

564
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:48,606
Close it! Go, go, go!

565
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:04,372
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

566
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:06,166
Jesus Christ.

567
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,750
Yeah.

568
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,086
You were right about her.

569
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,590
She had the drop on me, Ted.

570
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:16,676
Why didn't she shoot?

571
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,440
Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

572
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:04,993
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

573
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:07,996
Right now! Hands in the air!

574
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:28,725
- Hey, did you see that?
-Hey, get those guys over here.

575
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:31,185
Get them over here to help.

576
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,786
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

577
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,070
<i>What is your name?</i>

578
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,739
<i>My name is Evelyn Salt.</i>

579
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:26,616
What college will you attend?

580
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:28,659
Princeton University.

581
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,913
- Where will you work?
-The Central Intelligence Agency.

582
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,082
Who will you trust?

583
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,958
No one.

584
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:38,503
Be very patient.

585
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,421
Remember your training.

586
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:44,592
Remember, you're not the only one.

587
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,344
There are many others.

588
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:49,806
All of you waiting to strike.

589
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,100
- Yes.
-And we will strike.

590
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,937
- Together.
-Yes.

591
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,024
Wait.

592
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:06,697
One day, I will come for all of you.

593
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:14,580
Hello, Evelyn.

594
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:18,084
I'm Martin Crenshaw
from the U.S. Embassy.

595
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:22,130
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

596
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,057
<i>Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their new leader's words...</i>

597
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:36,727
<i>...and called on him to take strong
action against what they are calling...</i>

598
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,813
<i>...a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U.S.</i>

599
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,606
<i>...a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U.S.</i>

600
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:42,817
<i>These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks...</i>

601
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:46,154
...of <i>anti-American protests
across Russia.</i>

602
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,490
<i>"We will strike back,"
says the new Russian president...</i>

603
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:52,076
<i>...angrily condemning
today's assassination...</i>

604
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:55,705
...b <i>y American intelligence officer
Evelyn Salt.</i>

605
00:56:56,289 --> 00:56:59,876
<i>As the body of slain President Matveyev
is on its way back to Moscow...</i>

606
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,628
<i>...anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia...</i>

607
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,506
<i>...with bombings of U.S. diplomats'
cars in Moscow.</i>

608
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:09,760
<i>The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.</i>

609
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,972
<i>Responding to
a rapidly escalating crisis...</i>

610
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:16,350
<i>...President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting...</i>

611
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:19,937
<i>...with cabinet members, military
leaders and NATO representatives.</i>

612
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,024
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

613
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:32,116
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

614
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,251
You were not supposed
to get married.

615
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:46,839
Not unless it had
great tactical advantage.

616
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,716
I did it to seem normal.

617
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,552
When you escaped today, I thought:

618
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:55,890
"Even I could not have hoped
for so much."

619
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:59,936
You are my greatest creation.

620
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,272
You trained me well.

621
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:42,895
My husband, you have him?

622
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,439
I had to be certain.

623
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:47,692
But now you trust me?

624
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:48,901
Completely.

625
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:58,619
So...

626
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:01,038
I did it to seem normal.

627
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:03,541
Next, part two:

628
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:08,045
We seize control of
this country's atomic weapons.

629
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:10,339
How?

630
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,133
You'll see.

631
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,719
All right.

632
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,212
Satisfied?

633
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:33,964
I'm satisfied.

634
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:37,093
Comrades...

635
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:41,055
...our sister has rejoined us.

636
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:44,517
Russia will rise from the ashes...

637
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:48,145
...of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

638
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,941
And the world will hear us!

639
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:53,818
Will hear.

640
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,656
Welcome back to our family, sister.

641
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,618
Sister.

642
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:16,048
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

643
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:22,471
You're to meet an agent, NATO uniform,
at a plane here.

644
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:28,602
Tail number N182SL.

645
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:34,150
Final instructions will come from him.

646
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:37,445
- That's it.
-That's it.

647
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,656
After this, we go dark.

648
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,451
Radio silent.

649
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:46,245
You won't hear from me again...

650
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,080
...my daughter.

651
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:47,032
Forever and ever.

652
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,974
Have you heard from Orlov?

653
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:15,102
Yes. Last word was "go."

654
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:21,609
Chenkov.

655
01:04:23,152 --> 01:04:24,778
Do you remember me?

656
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,243
<i>Chenkov.</i>

657
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,288
Did you miss me?

658
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,040
Shnaider?

659
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:41,879
How long have you been here?

660
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:48,344
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

661
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:52,222
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

662
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,309
Colonel Edward Tomas.

663
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:58,812
And you are my attaché.

664
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,648
Your ID.

665
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,651
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

666
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,737
More importantly, our mission.

667
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:11,533
The bunker eight storeys
below the White House.

668
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:15,245
That's where the president
needs to be.

669
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:21,669
How do we do it?

670
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:25,923
Don't worry, he'll be there.
That's my job. I'll make sure he's there.

671
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:30,219
- What's my job?
-Do you remember, Chenkov...

672
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:34,139
...when we were young and you
had to finish first in everything?

673
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:36,058
Had to be the best at everything.

674
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:40,270
Though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane, you had to finish first.

675
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,022
I remember.

676
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:45,693
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

677
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:52,700
Tonight you will kill
America's president.

678
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:07,381
IDs, please.

679
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:10,175
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

680
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:11,593
I'll check the side.

681
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:16,390
Control, this is Hayes.

682
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:19,435
I have a Colonel Tomas
and a Major Vicek.

683
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,936
Undercarriage is clean.

684
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:23,230
Back's clean.

685
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:27,860
Colonel. Major. All clear.

686
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,582
You know the drill, colonel.

687
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:46,128
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

688
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:49,298
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

689
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,928
Step through, please, sir.

690
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,017
Turn around.

691
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:05,105
Thank you.

692
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,362
- Step through. Arms out.
-Patience is key.

693
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,616
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here longer.

694
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:18,118
- What others?
-I don't know.

695
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:21,455
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

696
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:25,084
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

697
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,960
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

698
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,337
- Major Vicek.
-Pleasure.

699
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:31,423
You'll have minutes to preview NATO's
point of view before the meeting.

700
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:35,761
Now, Ted, your Russian
Cl agent, Salt.

701
01:07:35,928 --> 01:07:39,264
- What can you tell us about her?
-We think she may be a Soviet plant...

702
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:45,145
...inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

703
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:49,483
A day marking the start of a large
strike against the U.S. and her allies.

704
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,243
This should be the president now.

705
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:04,373
You have a big job, Chenkov...

706
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:05,833
...but you can do it.

707
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,335
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

708
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:10,379
Home.

709
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,297
I'm going home.

710
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:18,136
- Down! Take cover!
-Get the president!

711
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,764
- A gun! He's got a gun!
-Get back!

712
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,308
Get back!

713
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:37,948
- Are you okay, sir?
-Yes.

714
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,617
- Goddamn it.
-Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

715
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:47,499
Help, over here!

716
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,045
Get a medic! Get a medic!

717
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,179
I think I saw her.

718
01:09:01,597 --> 01:09:03,223
You saw who?

719
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,476
Salt.

720
01:09:07,603 --> 01:09:09,229
I think I saw her in the corridor.

721
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,275
The other NATO officer.

722
01:09:16,695 --> 01:09:17,905
She's here.

723
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:20,574
Check.

724
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,117
- Clear.
-Move.

725
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:23,869
Go!

726
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,622
We may have a visual
on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

727
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:29,958
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

728
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:34,421
<i>This is not a drill.
The White House is under attack.</i>

729
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:38,467
<i>If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

730
01:09:38,634 --> 01:09:40,427
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

731
01:09:40,928 --> 01:09:43,263
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

732
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:47,559
Command, this is Jenks. I need
the PEOC bunker up and running.

733
01:09:47,726 --> 01:09:50,103
If this was authorised
by the Russian government...

734
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,814
...it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

735
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:58,236
<i>If you are near an exit, please
proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

736
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,322
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

737
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:02,157
- Clear!
-Let's go, sir.

738
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,453
Alpha team!

739
01:10:10,165 --> 01:10:11,792
Move, move.

740
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,794
Close it.

741
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:15,462
Close it.

742
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:25,472
<i>Please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.</i>

743
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:27,724
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

744
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:00,215
Go, go.

745
01:11:02,134 --> 01:11:04,678
Geronimo approaching bunker door
in five seconds.

746
01:11:09,433 --> 01:11:10,809
Clear.

747
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:20,068
Any chance she could follow?

748
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:22,320
My own men couldn't
get through that door.

749
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:25,157
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

750
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:30,537
Okay, go.

751
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,041
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

752
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,921
Geronimo secured.

753
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,368
- Get me Director Medford.
-Yes, sir.

754
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:14,247
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility...

755
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:17,292
...that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

756
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,504
Mr. President,
Director Medford is up.

757
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:23,256
Marion, what's the situation?

758
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:26,426
<i>It should be coming up
on one of your screens.</i>

759
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,262
<i>What you see there
represents temperature drops...</i>

760
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,598
<i>...in mobile missile units in Siberia.</i>

761
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:35,602
<i>It means the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.</i>

762
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:39,356
<i>And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.</i>

763
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:44,027
Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

764
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:46,613
At least at our forward bases.

765
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,407
Do it.

766
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:51,952
And since the Russians
have deployed...

767
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:55,872
...we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

768
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,126
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

769
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:03,171
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

770
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:24,985
Sir.

771
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:31,116
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

772
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:34,035
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

773
01:13:34,202 --> 01:13:36,830
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

774
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:41,126
Command, our eyes are down. We have
a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

775
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,253
Get out there now.

776
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,297
Seal this room.

777
01:13:47,382 --> 01:13:48,967
Down that corridor. Secure it.

778
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:36,723
<i>Victims are being taken to
George Washington Hospital.</i>

779
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:40,936
<i>Reports are coming in that there
are casualties at the White House.</i>

780
01:14:42,437 --> 01:14:44,189
This is President Howard Lewis.

781
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:48,193
<i>- Proceed with authentication.
- Yes, Mr. President.</i>

782
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:55,450
- Ready to commence authentication.
-Zulu.

783
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:56,701
- Tango.
-Echo.

784
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:57,869
- Seven.
-Niner.

785
01:14:58,036 --> 01:14:59,246
- Juliett.
-X-ray.

786
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:00,413
<i>- Sierra.
-Seven.</i>

787
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,581
- Alfa.
-Mike.

788
01:15:01,748 --> 01:15:03,416
- Charlie.
-Whisky.

789
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,626
<i>- Five.
-Six.</i>

790
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:07,879
<i>- Tango.
-Authentication codes confirmed.</i>

791
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,423
<i>It's all yours now, Mr. President.</i>

792
01:15:11,049 --> 01:15:12,300
God be with you.

793
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:17,138
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

794
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:19,266
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

795
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:22,686
<i>Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?</i>

796
01:15:24,396 --> 01:15:27,315
ls the camera outside
this door working? Put it up.

797
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:29,526
Officer Dryer, what's your status?

798
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,279
Officer Dryer, come in.

799
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:37,450
<i>Federal Communication Commission is
activating the Emergency Alert System.</i>

800
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,202
Who the hell's that?

801
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,914
That's her. That's Evelyn Salt.

802
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:44,791
She's in. Go to DEFCON 1.

803
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,459
Give me your side arm.

804
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:50,130
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

805
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:52,048
Screw protocol.
We got an enemy agent.

806
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:54,175
Protocol is protocol, sir.

807
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:57,345
And dead is dead.

808
01:15:58,096 --> 01:15:59,764
Behind me!

809
01:16:01,141 --> 01:16:02,851
I'm the national security advisor.

810
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,352
Not anymore.

811
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,320
Sit down.

812
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:17,699
Who are you?

813
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:21,202
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

814
01:16:22,454 --> 01:16:24,956
And unless you do exactly as I say...

815
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:27,667
...I will be the last person
you will ever see.

816
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,051
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

817
01:16:36,343 --> 01:16:37,677
Go to hell.

818
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:09,417
<i>Selective attack options ready.</i>

819
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:11,044
Ted?

820
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:16,341
<i>Emergency action message
released by...</i>

821
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,969
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

822
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:22,263
Why didn't you tell me?

823
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:27,060
I tried many times, but...

824
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:30,605
My loneliness was my only friend.

825
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:33,483
You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.

826
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,610
I was a class ahead, comrade.

827
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:38,071
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

828
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:41,157
And now it's my honour
to launch the attack.

829
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:43,076
Excuse me.

830
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:47,288
<i>Selective attack targets acquired.</i>

831
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,083
<i>Tehran.</i>

832
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,835
<i>Mecca.</i>

833
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,630
Mecca? Tehran?

834
01:17:55,797 --> 01:17:57,465
Part two of our plan.

835
01:17:57,632 --> 01:17:59,592
Kill nine million people.

836
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:01,761
Enrage a billion Muslims.

837
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:04,764
America will suffer a painful death.

838
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:07,934
<i>Permissive action links initiated.</i>

839
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:12,981
<i>Missiles arming.</i>

840
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:21,614
<i>Nuclear command...</i>

841
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,617
<i>...posts airborne.</i>

842
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,119
Let me join you.

843
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:30,456
<i>ICBMs set to...</i>

844
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:33,084
<i>...maximum yield.</i>

845
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:37,380
You know, when you first came
to Langley...

846
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:40,592
...I didn't think I'd be able
to do it.

847
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,678
I didn't think I'd be able to...

848
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:47,390
...resist the temptation
to say something.

849
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:50,393
Then you met Mike and...

850
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:52,353
...well...

851
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:54,814
...things changed.

852
01:18:57,901 --> 01:18:59,194
Let me join you.

853
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:04,657
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

854
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:12,999
Let me join you.

855
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:15,877
I want to be with you.

856
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:32,018
<i>The man we thought was dead has
made a resurrection that is miraculous.</i>

857
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:33,895
<i>President Matveyev is alive.</i>

858
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:36,189
<i>We're going to Russia.
What you are seeing...</i>

859
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,816
<i>...are live pictures of
Russian president Matve ye v.</i> ..

860
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:42,862
<i>...arriving at the airport outside
of Moscow. This is astonishing.</i>

861
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:46,241
<i>According to his doctors,
President Matveyev's mistaken death...</i>

862
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:48,785
...is <i>attributed to
a temporary paralysis...</i>

863
01:19:48,952 --> 01:19:51,496
<i>...from</i> a <i>toxin
derived from spider venom.</i>

864
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:55,875
<i>A recap for those who may not have
been following the events of the</i> day...

865
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:01,130
At least I was right.

866
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:07,512
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

867
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:11,557
I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

868
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,893
You were supposed to
recruit him, Ev...

869
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,687
...not fall in love with him.

870
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,065
That's why I told Orlov
to pick him up.

871
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,778
By the way, how is Mike?

872
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,865
Orlov is dead.

873
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,580
Well, that's good news.

874
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:36,291
Saved me the trouble.

875
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:42,422
I had to practically twist his arm to
get him to blow your cover at the CIA.

876
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:47,719
You see, he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

877
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:53,182
But you needed somebody
to take the blame.

878
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:56,436
I'm the patsy.

879
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,108
And I'm the hero.

880
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:06,779
Congratulations, Ev.

881
01:21:08,448 --> 01:21:10,992
You're about to become famous.

Get down on the floor, now!

894
01:23:57,575 --> 01:23:58,951
I said now!

895
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,918
<i>Launch sequence aborted.

896

897
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:10,922
- Get down!
-What is your name, sir?

898
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:14,425
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

899
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,803
Mr. President.

900
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,557
Mr. President, can you hear me?

901
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,810
- Hold still.
-EMT's on the way.

902
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,104
Make sure they got body bags.
At least seven.

903
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,814
She's wearing a vest.

904
01:24:29,357 --> 01:24:31,984
I'll meet you in five minutes.
I wanna get cleaned up.

905
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:33,736
And I want her alone in a room.

906
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:36,364
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

907
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,159
She won't talk. She's trained not to,
no matter what we do to her.

908
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:42,620
If we're gonna find these people,
we gotta do it.

909
01:24:42,787 --> 01:24:44,997
Somebody already did.
At least some of them.

910
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:48,042
Barge on the East River.
Twelve dead, including Orlov.

911
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:49,877
Who did that?

912
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:54,006
Don't know. Forensics are on it.

913
01:25:01,472 --> 01:25:04,350
No one comes through until
the president is secure. Step back.

914
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:06,769
- I'm Theodore Winter--
-Step back, sir. Please.

915
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:14,860
Well, sir, you're injured. Why don't you
have a seat? We'll take a look at you.

916
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:17,238
Are you okay?

917
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:20,449
Pretty good gash there.

918
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,202
Looks like you got a piece of glass
in there.

919
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:46,392
<i>She killed someone else.</i>

920
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:49,687
<i>It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.</i>

921
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,906
Check him. Check him!

922
01:26:01,741 --> 01:26:02,742
Checking vitals.

923
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,745
I'm not getting a pulse.
I'm not getting much.

924
01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:30,561
Sit down.

925
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:34,357
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

926
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,942
- Give me your hands.
-Then she's the FBl's.

927
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:23,114
H9)'-

928
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:25,741
Why'd you kill him?

929
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:27,493
Because somebody had to.

930
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:42,133
What?!

931
01:27:53,144 --> 01:27:56,063
By this, I take it you think
everybody is who they say they are.

932
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:59,859
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

933
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,485
So did I.

934
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:03,946
We just didn't know what it was.

935
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:07,366
- Winter did.
-Winter?

936
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:12,455
You expect me to believe that Winter
was gonna launch the missiles...

937
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,540
...and you saved the world?

938
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:18,836
I would like you
to believe that, yeah.

939
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:22,214
That's a big accusation.

940
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:24,717
Well...

941
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:28,596
...he's dead now
so he can't defend himself.

942
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:32,057
I guess you'll just have to
decide for yourself.

943
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,192
How many more like you are there?

944
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:43,444
Like me'?

945
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:46,280
None.

946
01:28:46,906 --> 01:28:48,365
Like him?

947
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,910
More than you or I can handle alone.

948
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:56,290
You really think
a trained Soviet agent...

949
01:28:56,457 --> 01:29:01,045
...couldn't kill the Russian president
at point-blank range if she wanted to?

950
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:07,426
Or you, for that matter.

951
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:10,429
I could've killed you at the funeral
and I didn't.

952
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,474
You surrendered to me
because I gave you no choice.

953
01:29:13,641 --> 01:29:15,559
You know better.

954
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,813
I had a choice.

955
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:20,606
You know better.

956
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:43,087
If I did believe you...

957
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:47,049
...and I'm not saying for a second
that I do, but if I did...

958
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:50,678
...nobody else would.

959
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:55,516
Well, maybe you can
think of a way around that.

960
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,405
They took everything from me.

961
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:12,950
I'll kill them.

962
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:29,341
ETA, four minutes.

963
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:37,474
Bullshit!

964
01:30:49,904 --> 01:30:53,198
We are approaching the Potomac,
heading due south and west.

965
01:30:58,871 --> 01:31:00,539
Go get them.

966
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:22,019
Salt!

967
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:34,156
Circle back! Circle back!
