1
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,439
I came here to tell you a story.

2
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,150
I don't like stories.

3
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,111
But l'll listen anyway.

4
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,897
Home to Grozny?

5
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,574
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

6
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,683
You'll see.

7
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,269
All right.

8
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,891
Satisfied?

9
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,602
I'm satisfied.

10
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,272
Comrades...

11
01:04:21,565 --> 01:04:25,193
...our sister has rejoined us.

12
01:04:25,569 --> 01:04:28,655
Russia will rise from the ashes...

13
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,283
...of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

14
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:36,121
And the world will hear us!

15
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:37,956
Will hear.

16
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,794
Welcome back to our family, sister.

17
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:46,798
Sister.

18
01:04:55,224 --> 01:05:00,937
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

19
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:07,318
You're to meet an agent,
NATO uniform, at a plane here.

20
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:13,491
Tail number N1 82SL.

21
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:19,038
Final instructions will come from him.

22
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,333
-That's it.
-That's it.

23
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,545
After this, we go dark.

24
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,339
Radio silent.

25
01:19:02,862 --> 01:19:06,031
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

26
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,122
I tried many times, but....

27
01:19:13,873 --> 01:19:16,667
My loneliness was my only friend.

28
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,672
I was a class ahead, comrade.

29
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,133
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

30
01:19:24,592 --> 01:19:27,219
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

31
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:29,138
Excuse me.

32
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,527
Part two of our plan.

33
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:45,654
Kill nine million people.

34
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,823
Enrage a billion Muslims.

35
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,826
America will suffer a painful death.

36
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,181
Let me join you.

37
01:20:43,963 --> 01:20:45,255
Let me join you.

38
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:50,719
All these years right in front of me
and l never knew.

39
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:59,061
Let me join you.

40
01:20:59,979 --> 01:21:01,939
I want to be with you.

41
01:31:37,808 --> 01:31:39,309
Our father has decided that...

42
01:31:39,476 --> 01:31:41,644
...the time has come...

43
01:31:41,812 --> 01:31:45,315
...for you all to start your new lives.

44
01:31:48,611 --> 01:31:53,281
To prepare for our next attack.

45
01:32:17,556 --> 01:32:19,641
Can l help you?
