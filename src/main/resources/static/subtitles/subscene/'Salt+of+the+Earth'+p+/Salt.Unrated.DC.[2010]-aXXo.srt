00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Salt-Unrated DC

2
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,788
North Korea
two years ago

3
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,971
Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

4
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,599
I'm really not who you think I am.

5
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,560
Please. Please. I'm not a spy.

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,270
You are a spy.
I'm not a spy.

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,565
Please let me go home.
Try again.

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,442
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

9
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,570
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

10
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,156
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

11
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,410
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

12
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,497
I am not a spy! I am not a spy!

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,604
Try again.
I am not a spy.

14
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,189
You are a spy.
I am not a spy.

15
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,691
Don't lie to me!

16
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,827
I am not a spy.

17
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:05,542
It is through the grace and munificence
of our glorious Dear Leader

18
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,337
that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea

19
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,091
has pardoned
the American imperialist

20
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,345
for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.

21
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:21,057
Keep your head down.
Don't say anything
till we make the swap.

22
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,853
In case Kim Jong
here changes his mind.

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,827
Exchange.

24
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,079
Right face!

25
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,418
Right face!

26
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,046
I don't understand.

27
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,465
You don't
understand what?

28
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,136
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life

29
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,056
is not worth blowing
operational cover.

30
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,432
You got that right.

31
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,603
If we have to
lose someone for
the greater good, we will.

32
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,812
So why did you do it?

33
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,816
Well, I didn't do it.

34
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,569
He did.

35
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,782
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

36
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,536
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

37
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,748
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something

38
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,460
or he's gonna invade this
goddamn rice-paddy republic
himself.

39
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,020
You okay?

40
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,607
Yeah.

41
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,403
Hey.

42
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,365
Good morning.
Happy anniversary.

43
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,578
You want me to make you breakfast?

44
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,164
How about pancakes?

45
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,291
Your cooking?

46
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,460
You're joking. You like my cooking.

47
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,628
Germans don't joke.

48
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,757
Burt likes my cooking.

49
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,849
Get your bugs off the table.

50
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,101
They're spiders.
They're bugs.

51
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,146
They're spiders.
They're bugs.

52
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,113
Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.

53
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,867
Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back,

54
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,870
and over one another
about a third of the way.

55
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,376
Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.

56
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,670
Are you doi ng this
on company time?

57
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,507
And insert your favorite silverware...
It's my anniversary.

58
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,010
And I want it to be perfect.

59
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,389
But that is not sexy.

60
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,266
No, but it is utilitarin.

61
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,602
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

62
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,356
I ran the trace. First name Usam,
last name Utsaev.

63
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,024
Any verifiable hits?
One.

64
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,528
Hey, Francis, do me
a favor and stick that
in the safe till tomorrow.

65
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,780
Mata Hari here's
got a big night tonight.

66
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,157
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

67
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,285
"Sir"? Do I look like a "sir" to you?

68
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,495
From head to toe.

69
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

70
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,128
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

71
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,006
Was I ever that young?

72
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,467
Younger.

73
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,970
Walk me out.

74
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,973
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

75
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,975
Oh, you know.
The usual.

76
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,561
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia

77
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,690
the day before it happens.
How about you?
I heard that interview went well.

78
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,567
Fingers crossed.

79
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,986
You sure about this?

80
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,114
You know, once you start pushing
paper, there's no turning back.

81
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,659
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

82
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,287
I was homesick.
Homesick?

83
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,789
Can't you take something for that?
Sir! Sir!

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,544
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

85
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,047
Here?
I guess he's not buying our cover.

86
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,215
Did you get his bona fides?
He's Russian.

87
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,509
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

88
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,887
He's a strange guy.
How's his English?

89
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,181
Passable. Not great.

90
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,225
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance...

91
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,021
Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

92
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,230
Come on, Salt.

93
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,567
No one can sort out a nutjob
from the real thing faster than you.

94
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,779
I got 25 minutes.
I got 26. Let's go.

95
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,788
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

96
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,207
Who called Counterintelligence?
Not me.

97
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,001
Hey, Ted.
We're crashing the party.

98
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,005
Peabody.
Salt.

99
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,970
Please remove the hood.

100
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,682
Microphones are on.

101
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,809
Checking levels.

102
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,520
Bseline recorded.

103
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,735
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

104
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,989
Ev.
Mm. Yeah.

105
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,325
Commencing audio
and visual recording.

106
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,460
Testing earpiece.

107
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,008
Interview has commenced at 1442.

108
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,811
You're married.

109
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,357
A husband must be a distraction

110
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,153
for a female intelligence officer.

111
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,488
Well, we're here to talk about you.

112
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,823
So, what is your name?

113
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,368
My name is

114
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,914
Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

115
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,337
I have cancer.

116
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,547
I'm moved.

117
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,841
A defector with cancer.

118
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,054
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

119
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,892
If I have gained anything
by damning myself,

120
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:25,148
it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

121
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,777
Russia is also dying.

122
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,364
But unlike me, she's not dead.
Oleg Vassily Orlov,

123
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,242
shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

124
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,703
He was on Victor Barisovsky's
staff there.

125
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,163
He checks out as FSB, Ev.

126
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,208
Scan says he's truthful
on the cancer.

127
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,793
Prior to '93?

128
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,087
Russia was once strong, poWerful...

129
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,756
Nothing.
He doesn't eXist.

130
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,677
And she Will be again
when things have been set back

131
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,845
on the correct path.

132
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,807
I have somewhere I need to be,
Mr. Orlov,

133
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,559
so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

134
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,941
I came here to tell you a story.

135
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,652
I don't like stories.

136
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,613
But I'll listen anyway.

137
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,699
In English, please.

138
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,659
Others are listening.

139
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,579
1975.

140
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,290
The Cold War.

141
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,877
In a gymnasium in Grozny,

142
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,296
a Soviet Olympic wrestler

143
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,009
named Sasha Fyorodovich
Chenkov

144
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,094
meets for the first time

145
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,598
the only female chess grand master
of her era;

146
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,478
Anka Nurekyova.

147
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,857
Within a month, they Were married.

148
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:52,485
And within a year, a child.

149
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,071
One month more,

150
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,284
the child was back
in the same hospital,

151
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,827
sick with fever.

152
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,749
And within days after that,

153
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,502
the child suddenly was dead.

154
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,550
Yes, a child Was dead.

155
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:19,929
And, yes, a child was buried.

156
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:30,690
But the Chenkov baby Was alive

157
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:35,236
and became the property
of another man.

158
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,783
A master spy Who had
devised the greatest plan

159
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,287
a Russian patriot
could ever invent.

160
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,792
A plan to destroy America.

161
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,419
It had all started

162
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:55,548
with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

163
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,844
In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.

164
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,931
Three years later, he returned home.

165
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,892
But the man
who came back to America

166
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:11,523
was in fact a Russian spy
named Alek.

167
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,443
On November 22nd, 1963,

168
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,156
Alek became the first success
of the neW program

169
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,827
and a hero of the Soviet Union.

170
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,122
The spymaster Was now
given the go-ahead

171
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,125
to create many more like Alek.

172
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,753
Scores of agents,
males and females,

173
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,548
to be substituted for Americans.

174
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,385
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

175
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,679
At an abandoned monastery,

176
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,641
Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English

177
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,352
long before they learned Russian.

178
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,646
Drilled in idiom,

179
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,024
idiosyncrasy and

180
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,359
ideology.

181
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:02,741
And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming,

182
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,994
the spymaster
made warriors of iron.

183
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,539
Unquestioning and unbreakable.

184
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,916
Who crossed first?

185
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,877
Who crossed last?

186
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,011
You're killing me, man.

187
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,388
When does the good fairy come in?

188
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,515
Never.

189
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,392
It's a story without hope.

190
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:34,564
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

191
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,318
There was an accident.
The family died.

192
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,404
Chenkov was sent to America

193
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,991
to live a complete lie

194
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,037
and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

195
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,247
Day X.

196
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,919
The long-awaited mission is here.

197
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,589
Chenkov will travel
to New York City

198
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,885
to kill the president of Russia

199
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:09,641
at the funeral of
the American vice president.

200
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:15,271
Chenkov is KA 12.

201
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,108
"KA."
Cold War legend.

202
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,110
Highly trained
Russian sleeper agents

203
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,155
inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

204
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,283
Supposedly they'd wait years
to strike. Decades, even.

205
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,328
Mm. Supposedly.

206
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,540
What, you don't believe in moles?
I believe in moles, all right.

207
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,041
Just not the bogeyman.

208
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,169
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

209
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,255
This guy's selling smoke.

210
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,340
Wrap it up, Ev.

211
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:47,804
So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? Is that it?

212
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,515
Mm-hm. Okay.

213
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,934
Thank you very much.

214
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,688
And what would you like
in return for that information?

215
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,566
I simply wish to help you do

216
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,152
what you need to do.

217
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,614
You're good.

218
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,494
The KA program
is brilliant bullshit.

219
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,706
But I'm officially off duty,

220
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,501
so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

221
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,754
Salt.
Yes?

222
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:25,258
The name of the Russian agent
is Salt.

223
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,886
Evelyn Salt.

224
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,224
My name is Evelyn Salt.

225
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,519
Then you are a Russian spy.

226
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,272
Truthful.

227
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:45,236
So far the fMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

228
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,116
Ted?

229
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,416
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

230
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,252
I need to get to the phone.
Not after the neural scan.

231
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,214
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

232
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,341
I am trained to, and so is he.

233
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,135
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

234
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,888
Let me call my husband.
Let me see it.

235
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,478
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

236
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,438
They don't just blow up their cover

237
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,108
they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

238
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,902
Do you remember Henley's wife?
Yes, I do.

239
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,570
Speaker.

240
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,533
Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks. Bye.

241
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,411
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

242
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,621
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

243
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,124
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

244
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:44,295
Someone interrogate that
piece of shit. Someone
who enjoys getting answers.

245
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,965
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

246
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,927
I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
I didn't say you were.

247
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,221
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

248
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,474
No, no. We gotta go to
a secure location. Now.

249
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,934
All right.

250
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,812
Doesn't get any more secure
than this.

251
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,149
Ev? Five minutes.

252
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,987
Call Protective Services, find Mike.
I will.

253
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,322
This is bullshit.

254
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,162
Give us a sec,
we'll be right in.

255
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,790
I know we're heading
into your jurisdiction.

256
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,751
I'm just asking for five minutes.
No.

257
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,719
If I have to. You can't have
five minutes. I have to talk to her.

258
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,305
She's scared. Don't you see that?
I don't care.

259
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,850
There is a mole
in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. I am sure.

260
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,907
Please step in the elevator.

261
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,560
--Russian president, okay? So I'm
gonna ask you to step out of my way.

262
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,902
What the hell is that?

263
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,529
Sir.

264
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,365
I gotta pee.

265
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,493
Where do you think he went?

266
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,705
No one saw him coming
out the front.

267
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,374
Jesus Christ.
Here he is again.

268
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,377
No sign of him so far on the street.

269
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,338
It's two minutes ago,
before lockdown.

270
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,132
Anything clean on him?
We just got a match, sir.

271
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,009
It's May Day, 1981.

272
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,386
There's Brezhnev. And there...

273
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,679
Orlov.
That's him.

274
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,724
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

275
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,976
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter,

276
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,188
airport, train station,
taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

277
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,524
Get me Medford on a secure line.
Yes, sir.

278
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,403
Top-right screen. Is that live?
Yes, sir.

279
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,905
Where is she going? Track her.

280
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,576
No one may leave the building.

281
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:03,995
Rink Petroleum, Security.

282
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:07,082
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

283
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,754
We lost the visual on her.
Damn it. Where'd she go?

284
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,756
We are on security lockdoWn.

285
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,759
Dave? It's Evelyn, is Mike there?

286
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,428
No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.

287
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,013
Hey, happy anniversary, huh?

288
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,848
The stairwell.

289
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,559
Second floor.
What's on that floor?

290
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,396
It's empty, a security buffer.
Isolate and seal it.

291
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,863
Get her records to my handheld.

292
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,742
East corridor.

293
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,458
Notifying Metropolitan Police.

294
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,052
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

295
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,517
We got her.

296
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,020
Locking down all floors.

297
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,605
Security Protective Service
responding to threat.

298
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,862
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

299
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,197
Yes, sir.
Director Medford, sir.

300
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,199
Get me a side arm.

301
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,327
I'll call her back.

302
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,294
Shit.
Lost visual.

303
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,213
Where is she, Albert?
Talk to me.

304
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,507
Come on.

305
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,225
North hallway.

306
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,951
There, interrogation room,
bring it up.

307
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,908
Switch down, switch down.

308
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:53,915
Have you found him?

309
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,917
What the hell are you doing, Ev?

310
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,252
This doesn't look good.

311
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,170
Let's do it.
Move.

312
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,798
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

313
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,425
Get your panties off the camera.

314
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,760
Get where We can see you
so you don't get hurt.

315
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,930
Have you found my husband?
These boys aren't fooling around.

316
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,271
Please. I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

317
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,981
Call me when you find Mike.

318
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,442
SWeeping corridors
outside the elevator.

319
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,157
Put the masks on.

320
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,616
Situation is hot.

321
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,962
Open the door about tWo feet.
We 're gonna gas her.

322
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,131
Tac team in position.
Waiting for a go.

323
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,507
Is that absolutely necessary?

324
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,468
What, you want me to shoot her?

325
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,845
Get a medical team in place now.

326
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,069
We're ready.

327
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,491
Now.

328
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,333
Okay, on my count.

329
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,045
Three, two, one. Go.

330
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,345
Jesus Christ.

331
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:47,404
Where is she? Come on, guys.

332
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,448
Find her, Albert. Now.
Suspect has escaped.

333
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,659
There. Bring that up.

334
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,580
Stay with her,
she's crossing the street.

335
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,249
Pan the goddamn camera.

336
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,887
Back that up and zoom in.

337
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,597
We're looking for Michael Krause.

338
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,224
Freeze.

339
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,685
We're looking for her husband, Mike.

340
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,061
What the hell are you doing, Ev?

341
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,064
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

342
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,859
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

343
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,945
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

344
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,864
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes away.

345
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,991
We can cover it,
but she won't go there.

346
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,827
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

347
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,537
Okay.

348
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,414
Taxi!

349
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,878
U Street. I'll tell you when to stop.

350
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:56,723
Hi, this is Mike. Please leave
a message after the tone.

351
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,669
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Ev,

352
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,922
and as such, enjoys pretty much
unrestricted access

353
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,508
to the borders of North Korea.

354
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:35,553
So brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

355
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,641
He's the perfect cover
to get us inside.

356
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,932
Mike?

357
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:26,521
Mike? Honey?

358
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,904
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

359
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,032
It's all right. Shh.

360
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,368
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

361
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,570
Come on. Come on.

362
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,370
Check for back eXits.

363
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,931
Go! Go!

364
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:49,187
Bedroom, clear!

365
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,565
Kitchen is clear.

366
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,361
Office, clear!

367
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,280
Living room, clear!

368
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,101
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

369
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,672
Come here.

370
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,258
What are you doing?

371
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,927
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

372
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,597
Did it ever occur to you that
that Russian was lying?

373
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,265
Why'd she run?
I don't know.

374
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,352
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

375
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,604
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

376
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,023
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

377
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,858
"Maybe" is your department.

378
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,694
Mine is catching her
so we can find out.

379
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,530
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

380
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,824
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

381
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:28,036
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

382
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,412
Should it?

383
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,250
Is your mom home?
No.

384
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,044
No? Can you do me a favor?
Yeah.

385
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:38,380
Hi. You baby-sit Burt for me?

386
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:42,550
Oh, yeah.
Yeah? Here's some money for food.

387
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,469
Hi, Burt.

388
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,429
What you doing?
You doing homework?

389
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,640
Yeah, math.

390
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:52,477
Algebra.
I hate math.

391
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,573
Hi. Nice to see you again.

392
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,327
You talking to me?
Yeah, I've seen you here before.

393
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:13,832
Yeah, I-- Yeah, I come here a lot.

394
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:14,999
You?

395
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,668
Oh, I'm working here.

396
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,044
At the museum.

397
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:21,089
I'm an arachnologist.
A what?

398
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,508
A spider hunter.

399
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,012
You look like one.

400
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:34,769
There are 40,000 species of spiders
in the world.

401
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:38,481
And that one is mine.

402
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:39,691
You discovered it.

403
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,109
Inside North Korea.

404
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:46,781
I named it Terrijoolsima peterbesti.

405
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,035
Do you get that?

406
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,079
No. Should I?

407
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:55,915
Peterbesti? I named it
after Pete Best.

408
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,625
The first drummer
before Ringo.

409
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:01,963
Best never was a famous Beatle,

410
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:07,802
but now he's a famous spider.

411
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,325
I got her.

412
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:33,244
She's heading north
towards the Metro station.

413
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:34,996
Ev!

414
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:00,897
Ev!

415
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,451
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

416
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,873
Excuse me.

417
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,554
Will do. Headed there noW.

418
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,431
There she is.

419
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,892
All teams, southbound
toward the bridge. Box her in.

420
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:49,821
Circle around!

421
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,740
Salt! Stop!

422
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:54,200
Keep her in your sights!
Coming up behind you!

423
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,744
Fuck!

424
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,750
Keep back! Hold your fire!

425
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,127
Salt! Down!

426
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,422
Salt!

427
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:15,221
Spread out!

428
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,433
Salt!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

429
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,727
On the ground. Now!
Please don't. No!

430
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,938
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

431
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,315
I have to find my husband.

432
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,275
Why'd you run?
To find my husband!

433
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,235
That's not a reason.
Don't shoot.

434
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,779
Stay back!
Last chance.

435
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,448
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

436
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,950
Don't make me put you down.
Put the gun down!

437
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,660
Give yourself up!
Come on, Ev.

438
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,372
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, I promise.

439
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,792
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

440
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,586
Somebody's going to try to
kill the Russian president.

441
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,506
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

442
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,966
There's nowhere to run! Quit now!

443
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,468
No, I didn't do anything.

444
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,011
Get back! No!

445
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,647
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

446
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,649
Get a roadblock in place now.

447
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,663
Metro Police on alert.

448
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:02,871
There she is. On the tanker.

449
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:05,582
Stop. Stop!

450
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,510
Ev!

451
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,820
You, my friend, have got
a mole in your group.

452
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:39,240
We don't know that yet.
I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar

453
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:42,118
and everything she's said
has been to protect her cover.

454
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,913
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

455
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,757
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

456
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,361
Okay, take it down.

457
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,206
Shit!

458
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,544
Shit!

459
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,177
Okay.

460
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:24,971
Ted, I know you're her friend,

461
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,599
but we gotta drop a net
on New York.

462
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:30,852
We gotta do it now.
Let's go!

463
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:36,941
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

464
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,862
Tell them Salt might be
coming their way.

465
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:46,743
And if she is,
Orlov may not
be far behind either.

466
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:49,788
You seen this?

467
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,374
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

468
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:56,836
She was in a car accident with
her parents in '88. They both died.

469
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:02,884
They were teachers at
the U.S. Embassy for
the American children of the staff.

470
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:06,012
That's why we
put her on Russia
in the first place.

471
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:11,059
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

472
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:14,729
Send everything we've got on Orlov
to N.Y.P.D.

473
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,370
And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up

474
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:15,165
and preparations are continuing
well into the night

475
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:18,418
for the funeral of
Vice President MaxWell Oates.

476
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:23,131
Among the dignitaries attending the
service at St. BartholomeW's Church

477
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,759
is Russian president
Boris Matveyev,

478
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:28,428
who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.

479
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:33,558
Public transportation will experience
delays, with subway closures and...

480
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,605
Evelyn.

481
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:40,815
Look at me.

482
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,653
If there was a way,
I would kill them.

483
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,450
You shouldn't have come here.

484
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:53,161
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

485
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,040
Now they know who you are.

486
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:59,084
Who?

487
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,920
Evelyn.

488
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,964
Who?

489
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,302
I would accept
anything about you,

490
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,221
but I need to know.

491
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:14,474
So look at me. Look at me.

492
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:19,145
Just tell me, okay?

493
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:20,814
Just tell me.

494
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:25,068
I work...

495
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:27,987
I work for the CIA.

496
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,492
So you see, there's...

497
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,413
There's no future for us.

498
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:41,501
You're not safe with me.

499
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:45,005
I don't wanna be safe.

500
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,217
I know you,

501
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,053
and I wanna be with you.

502
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:56,850
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

503
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,311
Okay?

504
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,150
Okay. Okay.

505
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:29,090
Welcome to New York,
Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

506
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:31,384
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

507
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,719
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

508
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:41,895
I'll put these in the closet, sir?

509
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,688
Yeah, fine.

510
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,527
I do solemnly swear

511
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:14,195
I do solemnly swear

512
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:21,369
that I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

513
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:23,872
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

514
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:26,833
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

515
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,835
That I will faithfully discharge

516
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,670
That I will faithfully discharge

517
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:33,381
the duties of the office
on which I'm about to enter.

518
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:36,593
the duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

519
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,055
So help me God.
So help me God.

520
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:48,313
A solemn day here in New York City.

521
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,399
The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates,

522
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:55,278
a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold War warrior

523
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:57,822
whose greatest legacy
may be as architect

524
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:01,284
of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

525
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,453
Russian president Boris Matveyev

526
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,414
has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer

527
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:10,794
to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the West.

528
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:10,979
What's the
security perimeter?

529
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:14,190
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

530
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:17,694
And those are
Secret Service agents,
not CIA.

531
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:21,322
So relax.
That's real funny.

532
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,034
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

533
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:29,122
Detail, halt.

534
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:33,543
Forward, march.

535
00:46:50,393 --> 00:46:54,814
Due to the funeral,
the 51 st Street station is closed.

536
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:03,323
Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51 st Street station is closed.

537
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:09,579
What--? Hey, what's going on?

538
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,164
Hey! There's smoke.

539
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,461
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

540
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:53,248
Eleanor. Good to see you.

541
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,542
Thank you.

542
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:01,506
Boris.
Mr. President.

543
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,345
Hello.

544
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:20,567
Please be seated.

545
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,165
Stand by for president's speech.

546
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:41,338
Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.

547
00:48:42,922 --> 00:48:44,090
Mrs. Oates.

548
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:49,262
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald...

549
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:53,516
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

550
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:56,853
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

551
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:05,862
I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.

552
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,323
As vice president,

553
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:13,036
he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

554
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:14,829
And today,

555
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:19,751
the world says goodbye
to a great man.

556
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,720
I'll check the back.

557
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,223
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

558
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,584
My friendship with Maxwell Oates

559
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:04,754
began in the unlikeliest of places:

560
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:06,798
Lima Zulu 4, come in.

561
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:08,842
Across the negotiating table...

562
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,760
What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?

563
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:12,137
We got two M lAs.

564
00:50:12,303 --> 00:50:17,434
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel
outside the crypt entrance
and Lima Zulu 5.

565
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,729
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

566
00:50:20,895 --> 00:50:22,522
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.

567
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:25,817
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

568
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:27,068
Converge on the crypt.

569
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:29,279
He made all the difference,
and for that,

570
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:34,325
he will always have
my respect and admiration.

571
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:23,124
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

572
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:31,091
What's going on?

573
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:43,478
Matveyev.

574
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:45,522
Get goddamn Matveyev.

575
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:03,331
Get the bomb squad in here!
Go, go!

576
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:44,748
Drop it!

577
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,792
Drop it!

578
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:58,011
Any MTs down here?
I see her.

579
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,930
Keep your hands up!
Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

580
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:04,351
Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
Don't move!

581
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:06,728
Do not move! Do not move!
Keep your hands up!

582
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:08,521
Take her down, take her down!

583
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,148
Check for other weapons.

584
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:13,568
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

585
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:15,570
I can't feel a pulse.

586
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:18,865
Jurisdiction is clear.
This is New York City.

587
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:21,493
N.Y.P.D. has her.
She's going to 1 Police Plaza.

588
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:24,204
I'm not arguing jurisdiction.
We don't know yet, sir.

589
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:26,956
The shooter is CIA. I know her.
Yes, I'll be there.

590
00:53:27,123 --> 00:53:28,583
I'll be on
the next chopper out.

591
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,878
Have your superior call the mayor.
Open up, guy, open up.

592
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:34,923
Back it up! Back it up!

593
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,051
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

594
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:40,637
Let's go, let's go.

595
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,430
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

596
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:43,848
Back up!
Keep moving.

597
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:45,100
Sir, back up!

598
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:48,019
Why? Why?!

599
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:52,315
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

600
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:54,067
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

601
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,277
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark hole!

602
00:53:56,444 --> 00:53:57,946
Get ahold of yourself.

603
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:00,115
Get the door, get the door.

604
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:02,951
Get off me!
Back off, man! Back off!

605
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:04,452
That's it. Let's go.

606
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:07,414
Stand back.

607
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:10,667
Close it! Go, go, go!

608
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:26,474
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

609
00:54:26,891 --> 00:54:28,226
Jesus Christ.

610
00:54:28,643 --> 00:54:29,811
Yeah.

611
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,147
You were right about her.

612
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:35,650
She had the drop on me, Ted.

613
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:38,737
Why didn't she shoot?

614
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:05,972
Natasha.

615
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:08,350
Natasha.

616
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,268
Is that you?

617
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:13,521
Did they give you a new face?

618
00:55:14,522 --> 00:55:17,359
I'm going home tomorrow,
Shnaider.

619
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:19,361
Home to Grozny?

620
00:55:19,527 --> 00:55:23,782
My home is in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.

621
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:29,412
My favorite place there
is McDonald's on Fern Street

622
00:55:29,704 --> 00:55:31,915
because it's near the river.

623
00:55:32,957 --> 00:55:35,251
But I won't want to go there
anymore

624
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:38,588
because my mother and father
are dead.

625
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,465
Natasha,

626
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,843
will you miss me?

627
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:49,140
My name is Evelyn Salt.

628
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:11,579
Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

629
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:04,132
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

630
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:07,135
Right now! Hands in the air!

631
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:27,864
Hey, did you see that?
Hey, get those guys over here.

632
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:30,325
Get them over here to help.

633
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,926
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

634
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:24,671
What college will you attend?

635
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:26,715
Princeton University.

636
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:28,049
Where will you work?

637
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:30,218
The Central Intelligence Agency.

638
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:32,137
Who will you trust?

639
00:58:32,303 --> 00:58:34,014
No one.

640
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,558
Be very patient.

641
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:38,435
Remember your training.

642
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:42,605
Remember, you're not the only one.

643
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:44,399
There are many others.

644
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:47,861
All of you waiting to strike.

645
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:50,113
Yes.
And we will strike.

646
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:53,992
Together.
Yes.

647
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:58,079
Wait.

648
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:04,753
One day,
I will come for all of you.

649
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:12,594
Hello, Evelyn.

650
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:16,097
I'm Martin Crenshaw
from the U.S. Embassy.

651
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:20,185
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

652
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:31,112
Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their neW leader's words

653
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:34,783
and called on him to take strong
action against What they are calling

654
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:38,578
a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U. S.

655
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:40,789
These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks

656
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:44,125
of anti-American protests
across Russia.

657
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:47,462
"We will strike back,"
says the new Russian president,

658
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:50,048
angrily condemning
today's assassination

659
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:53,677
by American intelligence officer
Evelyn Salt.

660
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,847
As the body of slain
President Matveyev is
on its Way back to Moscow,

661
00:59:58,014 --> 01:00:00,600
anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia,

662
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:03,478
with bombings of U. S. diplomats'
cars in Moscow.

663
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:07,732
The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.

664
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:10,944
Responding to
a rapidly escalating crisis,

665
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:14,322
President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting

666
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:17,909
with cabinet members, military
leaders and NA TO representatives.

667
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:20,995
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

668
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:30,088
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

669
01:00:37,512 --> 01:00:40,223
You were not supposed
to get married.

670
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:44,811
Not unless it had
great tactical advantage.

671
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:46,688
I did it to seem normal.

672
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:49,524
When you escaped today, I thought:

673
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:53,862
"Even I could not have hoped
for so much."

674
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:57,907
You are my greatest creation.

675
01:00:59,075 --> 01:01:01,244
You trained me well.

676
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:40,867
My husband, you have him?

677
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,411
I had to be certain.

678
01:01:43,578 --> 01:01:45,663
But now you trust me?

679
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:46,873
Completely.

680
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:59,010
So tell me what's next.

681
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,513
Next, part two:

682
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:06,017
We seize control of
this country's atomic weapons.

683
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,311
How?

684
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:10,105
You'll see.

685
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:12,691
All right.

686
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:00,530
Are you ready to watch him die?

687
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:10,040
Give me the gun.

688
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,960
That would be too easy.

689
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:15,313
Satisfied?

690
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:18,024
I'm satisfied.

691
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:21,695
Comrades,

692
01:04:21,986 --> 01:04:25,615
our sister has rejoined us.

693
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:29,077
Russia will rise from the ashes

694
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:32,706
of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

695
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:36,543
And the world will hear us!

696
01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:38,378
Will hear.

697
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:43,216
Welcome back to our family, sister.

698
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:47,220
Sister.

699
01:04:55,395 --> 01:05:01,317
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

700
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:07,741
You're to meet an agent,
NATO uniform,
at a plane here.

701
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:13,872
Tail number N182SL.

702
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:19,419
Final instructions will come from him.

703
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:22,714
That's it.
That's it.

704
01:05:23,256 --> 01:05:25,925
After this, we go dark.

705
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:28,720
Radio silent.

706
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,514
You won't hear from me again,

707
01:05:32,098 --> 01:05:33,350
my daughter.

708
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:36,473
Forever and ever.

709
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:02,040
Have you heard from Orlov?

710
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:04,376
Yes. Last word was "go."

711
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:10,882
Chenkov.

712
01:08:12,425 --> 01:08:14,052
Do you remember me?

713
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:20,517
Chenkov.

714
01:08:21,893 --> 01:08:23,561
Did you miss me?

715
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:25,313
Shnaider?

716
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:31,152
How long have you been here?

717
01:08:33,571 --> 01:08:37,617
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

718
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:41,496
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

719
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:44,582
Colonel Edward Tomas.

720
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:48,086
And you are my attache.

721
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:49,921
Your ID.

722
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:52,924
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

723
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:56,011
More importantly, our mission.

724
01:08:56,386 --> 01:09:00,807
The bunker eight stories
below the White House.

725
01:09:02,767 --> 01:09:04,519
That's where the president
needs to be.

726
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:10,942
How do we do it?

727
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:15,196
Don't worry, he'll be there.
That's my job.
I'll make sure he's there.

728
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:19,492
What's my job?
Do you remember, Chenkov,

729
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:23,413
when we were young and you
had to finish first in everything?

730
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,331
Had to be the best
at everything.

731
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:29,544
Though you knew you would
be beaten with a cane,
you had to finish first.

732
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:31,296
I remember.

733
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:34,966
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

734
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:41,973
Tonight you will kill
America's president.

735
01:09:54,819 --> 01:09:56,654
IDs, please.

736
01:09:57,322 --> 01:09:59,449
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

737
01:09:59,824 --> 01:10:01,368
I'll check the side.

738
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,663
Control, this is Hayes.

739
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,708
I have a Colonel Tomas
and a Major Vicek.

740
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:10,210
Undercarriage is clean.

741
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:12,504
Back's clean.

742
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:17,133
Colonel. Major. All clear.

743
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:31,648
You know the drill, colonel.

744
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:35,402
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

745
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:38,571
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

746
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:44,202
Step through, please, sir.

747
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:49,290
Turn around.

748
01:10:52,752 --> 01:10:54,379
Thank you.

749
01:10:58,883 --> 01:11:01,636
Step through. Arms out.
Patience is key.

750
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:04,889
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here longer.

751
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:07,392
What others?
I don't know.

752
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:10,729
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

753
01:11:10,895 --> 01:11:14,357
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

754
01:11:14,524 --> 01:11:16,234
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

755
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:17,610
Major Vicek.
Pleasure.

756
01:11:17,777 --> 01:11:20,697
You'll have minutes to preview
NATO's point of view
before the meeting.

757
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:25,035
Now, Ted, your Russian
CI agent, Salt.

758
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:28,538
What can you tell us about her?
We think she may be a Soviet plant,

759
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:34,419
inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

760
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:38,757
A day marking the start of a large
strike against the U.S. and her allies.

761
01:11:46,264 --> 01:11:48,516
This should be
the president now.

762
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:53,646
You have a big job, Chenkov,

763
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:55,106
but you can do it.

764
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,609
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

765
01:11:57,901 --> 01:11:59,652
Home.

766
01:11:59,944 --> 01:12:01,571
I'm going home.

767
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,452
Down! Take cover!
Get the president!

768
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:10,080
A gun! He's got a gun!
Get back!

769
01:12:12,415 --> 01:12:13,708
Get back!

770
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:28,306
Are you okay, sir?
Yes.

771
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:31,226
Goddamn it.
Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

772
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:38,066
Help, over here!

773
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,654
Get a medic! Get a medic!

774
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:51,830
I think I saw her.

775
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:53,873
You saw who?

776
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:57,127
Salt.

777
01:12:58,253 --> 01:12:59,879
I think I saw her in the corridor.

778
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:03,925
The other NATO officer.

779
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:08,555
She's here.

780
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:11,224
Check.

781
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:12,767
Clear.
Move.

782
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:14,519
Go!

783
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:17,272
We may have a visual
on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

784
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,608
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

785
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:25,071
This is not a drill.
The White House is under attack.

786
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:29,117
If you are near an exit,
please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.

787
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:31,077
This is not a drill.

788
01:13:31,578 --> 01:13:33,913
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

789
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:38,209
Command, this is Jenks. I need
the PEOC bunker up and running.

790
01:13:38,376 --> 01:13:40,754
If this was authorized
by the Russian government,

791
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,465
it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

792
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:48,887
If you are near an exit,
please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.

793
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:50,972
This is not a drill.

794
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:52,807
Clear!
Let's go, sir.

795
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:57,103
Alpha team!

796
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:02,442
Move, move.

797
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:04,444
Close it.

798
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,112
Close it.

799
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:16,122
Please proceed outside
in an orderly manner.

800
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:18,375
This is not a drill.

801
01:14:49,447 --> 01:14:50,865
Go, go.

802
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:55,328
Geronimo approaching
bunker door
in five seconds.

803
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:01,459
Clear.

804
01:15:09,467 --> 01:15:10,719
Any chance she could follow?

805
01:15:10,885 --> 01:15:12,971
My own men couldn't
get through that door.

806
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,807
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

807
01:15:20,186 --> 01:15:21,187
Okay, go.

808
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:24,691
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

809
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:30,572
Geronimo secured.

810
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:01,019
Get me Director Medford.
Yes, sir.

811
01:16:01,853 --> 01:16:04,898
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility

812
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:07,942
that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

813
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:11,154
Mr. President,
Director Medford is up.

814
01:16:12,405 --> 01:16:13,907
Marion, what's the situation?

815
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:17,077
It should be coming up
on one of your screens.

816
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:19,913
What you see there
represents temperature drops

817
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,248
in mobile missile units in Siberia.

818
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:26,252
It means the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.

819
01:16:26,419 --> 01:16:30,006
And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.

820
01:16:31,174 --> 01:16:34,678
Mr. President, I strongly
recommend we go from
DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

821
01:16:34,844 --> 01:16:37,263
At least at our forward bases.

822
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:40,058
Do it.

823
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:42,602
And since the Russians
have deployed,

824
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:46,523
we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

825
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,776
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

826
01:16:51,444 --> 01:16:53,822
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

827
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:15,635
Sir.

828
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:21,766
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

829
01:17:21,933 --> 01:17:24,686
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

830
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:27,480
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

831
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:31,776
Command, our eyes are down.
We have a PEOC
outer security door malfunction.

832
01:17:32,235 --> 01:17:33,903
Get out there now.

833
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:35,947
Seal this room.

834
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:39,617
Down that corridor. Secure it.

835
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:27,374
Victims are being taken to
George Washington Hospital.

836
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:31,586
Reports are coming in that there
are casualties at the White House.

837
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:34,839
This is President Howard Lewis.

838
01:18:35,006 --> 01:18:38,843
Proceed with authentication.
Y es, Mr. President.

839
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:44,974
Ready to commence authentication.

840
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:46,142
Zulu.

841
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:47,352
Tango.
Echo.

842
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:48,520
Seven.
Niner.

843
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:49,896
Juliett.
X-ray.

844
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:51,064
Sierra.
Seven.

845
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:52,232
Alfa.
Mike.

846
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,067
Charlie.
Whiskey.

847
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:55,235
Five.
Six.

848
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:56,403
Tango.

849
01:18:56,569 --> 01:18:58,530
Authentication codes confirmed.

850
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,074
It's all yours now, Mr. President.

851
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,951
God be with you.

852
01:19:04,744 --> 01:19:07,789
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

853
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,916
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

854
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:13,336
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

855
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:17,966
Is the camera outside
this door working? Put it up.

856
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,176
Officer Dryer, what's your status?

857
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:22,929
Officer Dryer, come in.

858
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:25,890
Federal Communication Commission

859
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:28,101
is activating
the Emergency Alert System.

860
01:19:28,268 --> 01:19:29,853
Who the hell's that?

861
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:33,565
That's her. That's Evelyn Salt.

862
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:35,442
She's in. Go to DEFCON 1.

863
01:19:35,608 --> 01:19:37,110
Give me your side arm.

864
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:40,822
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

865
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:42,699
Screw protocol.
We got an enemy agent.

866
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,826
Protocol is protocol, sir.

867
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,996
And dead is dead.

868
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,415
Behind me!

869
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:53,501
I'm the national security advisor.

870
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:55,003
Not anymore.

871
01:20:02,927 --> 01:20:03,970
Sit down.

872
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:08,350
Who are you?

873
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:11,853
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

874
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:15,607
And unless you do
exactly as I say,

875
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:18,360
I will be the last person
you will ever see.

876
01:20:24,366 --> 01:20:26,701
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

877
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,328
Go to hell.

878
01:20:55,271 --> 01:20:58,525
Selective attack options ready.

879
01:20:58,733 --> 01:21:00,151
Ted?

880
01:21:00,318 --> 01:21:05,448
Emergency action message
released by...

881
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:09,077
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

882
01:21:09,452 --> 01:21:11,371
Why didn't you tell me?

883
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:16,167
I tried many times, but...

884
01:21:16,918 --> 01:21:19,713
My loneliness was my only friend.

885
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:22,590
You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.

886
01:21:22,757 --> 01:21:24,718
I was a class ahead, comrade.

887
01:21:25,176 --> 01:21:27,178
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

888
01:21:27,637 --> 01:21:30,265
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

889
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,183
Excuse me.

890
01:21:32,892 --> 01:21:36,396
Selective attack targets acquired.

891
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:39,190
Tehran.

892
01:21:39,524 --> 01:21:40,942
Mecca.

893
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:44,738
Mecca? T ehran?

894
01:21:44,904 --> 01:21:46,573
Part two of our plan.

895
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,700
Kill nine million people.

896
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:50,869
Enrage a billion Muslims.

897
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,872
America will suffer a painful death.

898
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:58,376
Permissive action links initiated.

899
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:02,088
Missiles arming.

900
01:22:08,386 --> 01:22:10,722
Nuclear command

901
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:13,725
posts airborne.

902
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,226
Let me join you.

903
01:22:16,644 --> 01:22:19,564
ICMs set to

904
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:22,192
maximum yield.

905
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:26,613
You know, when you first came
to Langley,

906
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:29,699
I didn't think I'd be able
to do it.

907
01:22:30,825 --> 01:22:32,786
I didn't think I'd be able to

908
01:22:33,536 --> 01:22:36,498
resist the temptation
to say something.

909
01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:39,501
Then you met Mike and,

910
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:43,922
well, things changed.

911
01:22:47,008 --> 01:22:48,301
Let me join you.

912
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:53,765
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

913
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:02,107
Let me join you.

914
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:04,984
I want to be with you.

915
01:23:16,162 --> 01:23:21,126
The man
we thought Was dead has made
a resurrection that is miraculous.

916
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:23,003
President Matveyev is alive.

917
01:23:23,169 --> 01:23:25,296
We 're going to Russia.
What you are seeing

918
01:23:25,463 --> 01:23:27,924
are live pictures of
Russian president Matveyev

919
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:31,970
arriving at the airport outside
of MoscoW. This is astonishing.

920
01:23:32,137 --> 01:23:35,348
According to his doctors,
President Matveyev's
mistaken death

921
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:37,892
is attributed to
a temporary paralysis

922
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:40,603
from a toxin
derived from spider venom.

923
01:23:40,812 --> 01:23:44,983
A recap for those Who may
not have been following
the events of the day...

924
01:23:48,194 --> 01:23:50,238
At least I was rig ht.

925
01:23:53,116 --> 01:23:56,619
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

926
01:23:56,911 --> 01:24:00,665
I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

927
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:03,001
You were supposed to
recruit him, Ev,

928
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:04,794
not fall in love with him.

929
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,173
That's why I told Orlov
to pick him up.

930
01:24:10,675 --> 01:24:12,927
By the way, how is Mike?

931
01:24:14,888 --> 01:24:16,973
Orlov is dead.

932
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:23,730
Well, that's good news.

933
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,440
Saved me the trouble.

934
01:24:27,108 --> 01:24:31,529
I had to practically twist his arm to
get him to blow your cover at the CIA.

935
01:24:33,323 --> 01:24:36,826
You see, he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

936
01:24:40,163 --> 01:24:42,290
But you needed somebody
to take the blame.

937
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,585
I'm the patsy.

938
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,257
And I'm the hero.

939
01:24:53,593 --> 01:24:55,929
Congratulations, Ev.

940
01:24:57,597 --> 01:25:00,141
You're about to become famous.

941
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:37,429
Identity confirmation requested.

942
01:25:49,941 --> 01:25:52,902
Identity confirmation requested.

943
01:25:57,907 --> 01:25:59,534
Identity confirmed.

944
01:26:14,507 --> 01:26:18,595
Minuteman lll lCBMs' batteries
up to poWer.

945
01:26:57,967 --> 01:27:00,261
Authorization, 9 percent.

946
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:08,436
Go!

947
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:11,439
Permissive action links initiated.

948
01:27:11,606 --> 01:27:15,276
Trident submarines
at firing readiness.

949
01:27:16,027 --> 01:27:17,112
Permission to launch.

950
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:19,781
Permission to launch.

951
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:50,812
Get down on the floor, now!

952
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:52,939
I said now!

953
01:27:57,944 --> 01:28:00,572
Launch sequence aborted.
Systems restored.

954
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:03,074
Move, move, move!
Show me your hands!

955
01:28:03,241 --> 01:28:05,368
Get down!
What is your name, sir?

956
01:28:05,535 --> 01:28:08,413
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

957
01:28:09,914 --> 01:28:11,791
Mr. President.

958
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:15,545
Mr. President, can you hear me?

959
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:19,007
Hold still.
EMT's on the way.

960
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:21,092
Make sure they got body bags.
At least seven.

961
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:22,802
She's wearing a vest.

962
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:25,972
I'll meet you in five minutes.
I wanna get cleaned up.

963
01:28:26,139 --> 01:28:27,724
And I want her alone in a room.

964
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:30,352
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

965
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,189
She won't talk. She's trained not to,
no matter what we do to her.

966
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:36,608
If we're gonna
find these people,
we gotta do it.

967
01:28:36,775 --> 01:28:38,985
Somebody already did.
At least some of them.

968
01:28:39,152 --> 01:28:42,030
Barge on the East River.
Twelve dead, including Orlov.

969
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:43,865
Who did that?

970
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:48,036
Don't know. Forensics are on it.

971
01:28:49,913 --> 01:28:52,165
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
I'll be right back.

972
01:28:58,546 --> 01:29:02,801
Well, sir, you're injured.
Why don't you have a seat?
We'll take a look at you.

973
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,220
Are you okay?

974
01:29:06,054 --> 01:29:08,390
Pretty good gash there.

975
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:11,184
Looks like you got a piece
of glass in there.

976
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:36,376
She killed someone else.

977
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:39,212
It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.

978
01:29:48,471 --> 01:29:50,390
Check him. Check him!

979
01:29:51,182 --> 01:29:52,225
Checking vitals.

980
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:55,186
I'm not getting a pulse.
I'm not getting much.

981
01:30:18,376 --> 01:30:20,045
Sit down.

982
01:30:21,296 --> 01:30:23,840
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

983
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,426
Give me your hands.
Then she's the FBl's.

984
01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:12,597
Hey.

985
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,225
Why'd you kill him?

986
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:17,018
Because somebody had to.

987
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:31,616
What?!

988
01:31:42,627 --> 01:31:45,547
By this, I take it you think
everybody is who
they say they are.

989
01:31:46,798 --> 01:31:49,384
You knew something
was wrong the moment
Orlov walked in.

990
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:50,969
So did l.

991
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:53,430
We just didn't know
what it was.

992
01:31:53,888 --> 01:31:56,891
Winter did.
Winter?

993
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:01,938
You expect me to believe
that Winter was gonna
launch the missiles

994
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:04,024
and you saved the world?

995
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:08,319
I would like you
to believe that, yeah.

996
01:32:10,155 --> 01:32:11,740
That's a big accusation.

997
01:32:12,907 --> 01:32:14,242
Well,

998
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:18,079
he's dead now
so he can't defend himself.

999
01:32:18,288 --> 01:32:21,583
I guess you'll just have to
decide for yourself.

1000
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:30,675
How many more like you
are there?

1001
01:32:31,259 --> 01:32:32,927
Like me?

1002
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:35,764
None.

1003
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:37,849
Like him?

1004
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,393
More than you or I
can handle alone.

1005
01:32:43,104 --> 01:32:45,774
You really think
a trained Soviet agent

1006
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:50,528
couldn't kill the Russian
president at point-blank
range if she wanted to?

1007
01:32:54,657 --> 01:32:56,951
Or you, for that matter.

1008
01:32:57,619 --> 01:32:59,913
I could've killed you
at the funeral
and I didn't.

1009
01:33:00,413 --> 01:33:02,957
You surrendered to me
because I gave you no choice.

1010
01:33:03,124 --> 01:33:05,043
You know better.

1011
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,296
I had a choice.

1012
01:33:08,922 --> 01:33:10,090
You know better.

1013
01:33:30,318 --> 01:33:32,570
If I did believe you,

1014
01:33:32,737 --> 01:33:36,533
and I'm not saying for a second
that I do, but if I did,

1015
01:33:38,451 --> 01:33:40,161
nobody else would.

1016
01:33:41,788 --> 01:33:44,999
Well, maybe you can
think of a way around that.

1017
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:58,888
They took everything from me.

1018
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,434
I'll kill them.

1019
01:34:16,489 --> 01:34:18,867
ETA, four minutes.

1020
01:34:25,874 --> 01:34:26,958
Bullshit!

1021
01:34:39,387 --> 01:34:42,724
We are approaching the Potomac,
heading due south and west.

1022
01:34:48,396 --> 01:34:50,065
Go get them.

1023
01:35:10,418 --> 01:35:11,503
Salt!

1024
01:35:20,178 --> 01:35:23,640
Circle back! Circle back!

1025
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:22,615
New U.S. President Joseph Steppens
announced today

1026
01:36:22,782 --> 01:36:24,784
that with the death of
Natasha Chenkov,

1027
01:36:24,951 --> 01:36:28,663
known in the U. S. as Evelyn Salt,
all elements of the terrorist group

1028
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:31,166
have been eliminated.
The announcement came

1029
01:36:31,332 --> 01:36:33,209
during his Moscow
peacekeeping visit

1030
01:36:33,376 --> 01:36:35,795
where President Steppens paused
to lay floWers

1031
01:36:35,962 --> 01:36:40,592
at the site of the 1974 plane crash
that killed his parents and sister

1032
01:36:40,759 --> 01:36:43,386
while on a tour of Russia.
