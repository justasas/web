2
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,544
Please, you must drink some tea.

3
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,457
Here. Take it off.

4
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,093
Here.

5
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,217
Could you move your head forward
please?

6
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,985
A little.

7
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,298
There we go.

8
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,670
Nice meeting you again.

9
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,666
I demand to be set free.

10
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,668
Now... Now!

11
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,870
Please drink.

12
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,937
No, thank you.

13
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,506
It may taste strange,
even bitter,

14
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,341
but it will help you adapt
to the altitude.

15
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,775
I do not care.

16
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,011
The tea is brewed
from coca leaves, that is it.

17
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,380
I want my handcuffs removed.

18
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,116
You have scratched one of
my men and bitten another.

19
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,351
I am proud of that.

20
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:54,266
Well, that is why
you are wearing handcuffs!

21
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,993
Can I take them off now?

22
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,539
Look at me!

23
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,630
Look at me.

24
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,964
Can I take them off now?

25
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,811
Yes, you can!

26
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,207
Please put the cup down.

27
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,020
Put the cup down.

28
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,357
Your hands...

29
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,296
Ah! Ah!

30
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,969
Is that better?

31
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,860
I demand an explanation.

32
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,528
Everything will fall into place.

33
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,230
When will I get
my passport back?

34
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,164
I'm not sure.

35
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,732
When will I be able to leave?

36
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,852
Of that, too, I am unsure.

37
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm hungry.

38
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,910
I haven't eaten
since I was on the plane.

39
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,157
Thirty hours ago.

40
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,842
Thank you.

41
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,767
Here.
Please, take the tablecloth.

42
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,485
Thanks.

43
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,204
Would you like me to get you
something else?

44
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,772
No, I get terribly jet-lagged

45
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,208
when I eat too much
on overnight flights.

46
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,077
Just leave me
the apple juice, please.

47
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,837
- Okay.
- Thank you.

48
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,594
Sweetheart.

49
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:32,086
Can I have another
glass of champagne, please?

50
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,398
Your fourth?

51
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:37,069
I like that you keep count
on what's good for me.

52
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,330
And another glass for
my most attractive companion.

53
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,199
Professor Sommerfeld.

54
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,448
L-A-U-R-A Sommerfeld.

55
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,883
<i>Merci.</i>

56
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,557
Let's celebrate.

57
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,395
Celebrate what?

58
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,656
Can we get another glass
for Dr. Meier,

59
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:12,059
who's right there,
across the isle?

60
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,795
We are all on the same...
journey together.

61
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,865
We need to warm up
for the journey ahead.

62
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,500
Make mine a double bourbon.

63
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,302
Straight, no ice.

64
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:26,674
And, uh, what, if I may ask,

65
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,742
is your joyful party all about?

66
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,711
We are a scientific delegation.

67
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,945
Ah.

68
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,747
She's Professor
Laura Sommerfeld,

69
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,182
our fearless leader.

70
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,685
We come with the United Nations.

71
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:41,221
To look into
an ecological disaster.

72
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,490
The Diablo Blanco Disaster.

73
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,492
Diablo Blanco?
I hadn't heard of that.

74
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,407
Diablo Blanco will soon be
a household name.

75
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,190
Dr. Cavani.

76
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,661
Fabio.

77
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,764
You can call me Fabio.

78
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,011
Sorry.

79
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,572
Is there anyway
I could change seats?

80
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,954
I am so sorry.
The plane is completely full.

81
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,291
I'm so sorry I can't help.

82
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,969
Professor Sommerfeld.

83
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,616
Sleep well.

84
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,720
Call me Laura.

85
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,826
What's the local time?

86
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,861
- I don't know.
- Let me do it for you.

87
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,274
Thank you.

88
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,966
What's our greeter's name?

89
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,046
Helmholtz.

90
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:12,239
He's from the Ministry of
Agriculture and the Environment,

91
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,186
and he's coming
with two people, um...

92
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,290
which, uh...

93
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,013
Uh...

94
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,982
I can't seem to read this.
It's...

95
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,750
It's my own handwriting. I...

96
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,965
I don't even understand it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

97
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,506
Hm, no. No signal.

98
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,644
Mine's dead, too.

99
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,239
We will ask them to provide us
with local phones.

100
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,307
You know but, my apps
can become very useful.

101
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,575
Such as?

102
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,055
My diary.

103
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,724
April 14th...

104
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,683
Arrivals hall, immigration line.

105
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,819
The line is, uh...

106
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,787
lethargic.

107
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,423
It's, uh, listless...

108
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,259
torpid...

109
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,871
moribund.

110
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,363
I think I put that quite well,
didn't I?

111
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,675
Right?

112
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,712
And, uh, we're waiting.

113
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,537
And staring.

114
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,172
Staring.
People staring at us.

115
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,508
As if they were competing
for the world championship

116
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,010
of slow looks.

117
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,246
Dr, Meier,
why are they staring at us?

118
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:30,462
When I stare back at them,
they don't look away.

119
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,454
Where is my luggage?

120
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,567
Mine is not coming out either.

121
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:48,195
Oh, fuck, I forgot
to pack my toothbrush.

122
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,608
I didn't bring
a toothbrush with me.

123
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,344
<i>Mierda.</i>

124
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,649
<i>No? Bueno.</i>

125
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,128
<i>Gracias.</i>

126
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,030
Let's just go.

127
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,193
Yeah.

128
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,001
It happens.

129
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,207
Well...

130
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,833
I'm sure they'll come
any minute now.

131
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,213
Sure thing. Oh, yeah.

132
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,638
Where are they?

133
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,473
You confirmed
our arrival plans, Cavani?

134
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,407
Right?

135
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,309
Right-o! Yeah.

136
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,711
I did.

137
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,012
Shall I check at the curb?

138
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,246
No, no, no.
Let's stick together.

139
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,860
Someone will show up
sooner or later.

140
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,529
Hello, hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.

141
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,376
It's me. Welcome.

142
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,868
Oh, Professor Sommerfeld.
Welcome, welcome.

143
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:35,736
Hello!

144
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,138
- Doctor Cavani, welcome.
- Yes.

145
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,306
You must be Dr. Meier.

146
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,541
Welcome to you, too, sir.
Welcome.

147
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,743
Did you have a good flight?

148
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:43,643
Yeah. Good.

149
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,145
We are just
a little bit jet-lagged.

150
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,047
Of course, I can understand.

151
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,449
Oh, I'm sorry,
I haven't introduced myself.

152
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,951
I am Aristides
from the Ministry.

153
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,119
Aristides?

154
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,020
Yes. Aristides.
Now...

155
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,455
the Minister
and his group apologize.

156
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,390
There has been
a change of plans.

157
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,626
The Minister is already
in Oruro,

158
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,807
and he asks that you
take his plane directly there.

159
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,637
"Forgive us, kind gentlemen,

160
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,241
but we are forced to meet you
in Oruro later today."

161
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,177
The letterhead
says Internal Security.

162
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,445
Isn't our liaison

163
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,181
the Minister of Agriculture
and the Environment?

164
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,817
Oh, there's been a mistake.
This shouldn't be here.

165
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:24,951
A mistake?

166
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,387
Yes. This is a mistake. Uh...

167
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,688
Uh...

168
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:31,057
I wasn't supposed
to let you know,

169
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,092
but I am obliged to now.

170
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,326
The Minister is, in fact,

171
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,896
also associated with
the security establishment.

172
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,332
It shows his increasing
importance within the government.

173
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,601
But we don't
have our luggage yet.

174
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,436
Oh, don't worry about that.
Don't worry about anything.

175
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,505
My boys will take care
of everything.

176
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,507
In fact, they'll see you
through security.

177
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,576
No inspections, no passports.

178
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,344
I just need your luggage tags

179
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,681
and we'll have your luggage
taken directly to the plane.

180
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,661
Great.
Sounds like a treat.

181
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,064
Okay. Let's go.

182
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,658
I'm afraid
I'll have to leave you here.

183
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,594
- And our luggage?
- It's already loaded.

184
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,195
How did you load it so quickly?

185
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,164
This isn't a German airport
or New York.

186
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,398
We are much more efficient.

187
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,833
It's just my instruments.

188
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,135
I don't care about my shirts,
but my equipment.

189
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,871
Let us worry about all that.

190
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,650
Bon voyage.

191
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,154
Please, come aboard.

192
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,691
I'm kind of hungry.

193
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,629
My apologies.
I ate half.

194
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,032
Thank you.

195
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,592
"For one, too much.
For all, too little."

196
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,905
Sounds familiar.
Who said that?

197
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,274
Alexander the Great.

198
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:55,235
One day his army
was perishing from thirst...

199
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,070
and a foot soldier came by

200
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,272
with a helmet filled with water

201
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,120
he had collected drop by drop
for weeks.

202
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,611
He gave it to Alexander,

203
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,657
who spilled it on the floor.

204
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,748
And he had said that.

205
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,051
He said, "For one, too much.

206
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,964
For all, too little."

207
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,323
It's not going to be easy
out there.

208
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,659
As long as I have my equipment
everything will be fine.

209
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,362
As long as we have some
pasta al dente

210
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,297
and some white truffles...

211
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,901
and a buxom wench serving wine.

212
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:31,137
And some vineyards
in the mountains...

213
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,007
and the lusty cheers
of the vintners...

214
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,409
Cavani, you are a poet.

215
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,523
Everything will be fine.

216
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,621
Please come out.

217
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,048
What is this?

218
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,427
Who are these men?

219
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,530
I am not going to get out here.

220
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,222
Where-where is the Minister?

221
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:25,703
Please. Please step out.

222
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,092
Ay. No, no, no.

223
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,293
No, no, no, no, no, no no.

224
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,444
What is this?

225
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,597
You are under our protection.
We have a security problem.

226
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,665
Who are you?

227
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,467
- I know who I am.
- Who sent you?

228
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,118
I'm not gonna tell you.

229
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:43,770
I am professor Sommerfeld
and leader of this delegation.

230
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,672
We are under the protection
of the government.

231
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,774
Yes, yes. And?

232
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,376
And we are under the protection
of the United Nations.

233
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,445
I know, I know, I know.

234
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,148
Come outside, please.
We have cars waiting for you.

235
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,683
Hey, and our luggage?

236
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,619
Hey... don't touch me.

237
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,021
I'm not going.
I'll stay here!

238
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,557
I'm not going with you!
Don't touch me!

239
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,459
You are my prisoners!

240
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,039
All of you are my prisoners!

241
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,813
Hold this motherfucker!

242
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,017
Ah! Dr. Meier!

243
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,010
Ah! Ay, ay, ay, ay.

244
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,478
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

245
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,946
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

246
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,526
<i>- Vamos!</i>
- Ay!

247
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,062
No!

248
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,855
Dr. Meier, don't fight.
They'll hurt you.

249
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,124
Stop fighting back!

250
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,371
We give up!
Stop!

251
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,800
Ah!

252
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,914
Meier? Meier?

253
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,951
<i>Vamos, vamos!</i>

254
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,139
Get him away.

255
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,853
Come on.
Get this motherfucker away.

256
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,217
Don't touch me.

257
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,295
So...

258
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,821
This was all a plan
from the beginning?

259
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,768
In a way, yes.

260
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,660
Why have you abducted us?
What's your plan now?

261
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,929
Everything will fall into place.

262
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,742
It depends on you.

263
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,467
There is no question
that our embassy

264
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,536
has been alerted
to our disappearance.

265
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,638
They are already in crisis mode.

266
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:39,972
But it is irrelevant,

267
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,953
because there will be
no negotiations.

268
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,946
And the delegation who was
supposed to meet us upon arrival?

269
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,314
Have you taken them, too?

270
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,718
No. They were easily bribed.

271
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,619
I take no pride in this.

272
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,922
I don't approve of pay-offs
to anyone.

273
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,423
Do me one favor!

274
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,859
Do not try to come
to the rescue...

275
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,161
of a tired world.

276
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,731
I'd like to know your name.

277
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,834
As long as I wear this mask
I have no name.

278
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:10,603
But I know the face
of this gentleman.

279
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,139
Krauss, why don't you
remove your mask?

280
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,386
You are compromised, aren't you?

281
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,480
Krauss? You said
your name was Aristides.

282
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,683
In fact, if facts count here,
it isn't Aristides.

283
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,752
So it is Krauss.

284
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:27,832
Yes, and no.

285
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,957
And how were you able
to get here so quickly?

286
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,559
- We have our ways.
- And who is "we"? I would like to know.

287
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,928
"We"... that is basically me.

288
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,708
I am the brain.

289
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,533
I am leading a delegation.

290
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:43,002
I am responsible
for its members.

291
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,238
Where are they?
Are they all right?

292
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,206
I can assure you they are fine.

293
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,476
I accept no assurances
from an unidentified man

294
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,278
with no name and no face.

295
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,380
I want to see them, now.

296
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,715
Well, hopefully...

297
00:24:55,795 --> 00:25:00,397
the time will come when there
are no more secrets between us.

298
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,324
Dr. Arnold Meier
and Dr. Fabio Cavani

299
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,638
are both here at the compound.

300
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:10,963
How is Dr. Meier?

301
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,099
I saw your men hurt him.

302
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,835
He is bruised,
but otherwise subdued.

303
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:16,903
Meaning what?

304
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,238
As Dr. Meier
proved to be so combative,

305
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:22,041
we had to calm his heroism
a little bit.

306
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,444
Krauss, why don't you
show Professor Sommerfeld

307
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,746
the food she should avoid.

308
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,759
Go on, have a look.

309
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,286
Please do not eat these,

310
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:36,489
even if offered with every
indication of warm hospitality.

311
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,990
You gave this to my delegation?

312
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,426
We did nothing.
Our guests ate it...

313
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:44,030
and then they came down with a local
form of... What's happened to them?

314
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,964
Say it.

315
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,632
Diarrhea.

316
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,432
Krauss...

317
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,582
why don't you show our guest
to her quarters?

318
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,692
Life in a wheelchair
has its comforts,

319
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,160
but not all the time.

320
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,261
I see.

321
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,964
It's okay.
One day I shall walk again.

322
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:21,445
Dr. Meier, Dr. Cavani,
please come to the window.

323
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:25,671
I... I'm dying.

324
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:26,939
- No, you're not.
- I'm dying, I'm...

325
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,441
- No, you're not.
- I'm dying.

326
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,108
- No, you're not.
- I'm dying!

327
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,777
The dumplings, it must have
been the dumplings.

328
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:32,979
Are you hurt?

329
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,047
Yes, but I am going to be fine.

330
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,582
It's just my stomach.

331
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,518
I've got
the Dresden of Diarrhea.

332
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,554
It's a horde of protozoans

333
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,689
swirling around
my intestinal tract.

334
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,958
I may be dying.
I may be dying.

335
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,493
The noblest place
for a man to die

336
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,740
is the place
he dies the deadest.

337
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:54,066
This is the
Mother of all Diarrhea.

338
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,401
Take care.

339
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,570
Keep yourself hydrated
and get some rest.

340
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,238
Professor Sommerfeld,

341
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,485
I wish I could help you.

342
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,557
Please abstain from gossiping
in that ugly language.

343
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,559
I'm fine,
I can take care of myself,

344
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,228
of my situation,
of our situation.

345
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,197
- Let me try.
- Madame...

346
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,265
please follow me.

347
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,712
Your quarters
are in the adjacent courtyard.

348
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,786
This way.

349
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,759
Ay, ay...

350
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,895
Ay, ay...

351
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:38,542
Laura, you look a mess.

352
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,667
Good morning.

353
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:05,536
Good morning.

354
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,938
Good morning.

355
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,264
Rest assured.
This food is safe to eat.

356
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,224
Thank you, Krauss.

357
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,876
Half for you, half for me.

358
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,522
You choose.

359
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:30,916
Excuse me for taking your share,

360
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,429
but I'm hungry.

361
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,020
And I'm sure...

362
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,357
you didn't abduct me
to poison me.

363
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,538
Not at all. I'm
glad to see you eating.

364
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:53,706
I would like to see Dr. Meier
and Dr. Cavani.

365
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,841
Be assured...

366
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,589
they are my respected guests.

367
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:07,153
Why are you holding me hostage?

368
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,932
Is it for money?

369
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,925
I can contact some officials
to negotiate.

370
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,404
No.

371
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:17,463
Tell me what you want.

372
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,998
You must be Secret Service.

373
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:21,167
Are you enjoying the massive
support of the government?

374
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,835
I am no Secret Service,
no government,

375
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,471
no plot of the CIA,
or anything of the sort.

376
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,317
Who are you, then?

377
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,856
Professor, I expected more
of you.

378
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:36,994
Matt Riley.

379
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,299
The CEO of the Consortium.

380
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,627
The Consortium exists
only as a legal entity today.

381
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:51,463
As you may know, after the
ever-opportunistic Swiss

382
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,065
sold their majority stock,

383
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,267
the Chinese, the Americans,

384
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,169
the South Koreans...

385
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,873
all ducked into the trenches
and became invisible.

386
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,819
But they're still there.

387
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:07,746
They are all responsible
for the Diablo Blanco Disaster.

388
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,149
Despite that the disaster
had already begun

389
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:14,298
when I took over as CEO,
I personally feel responsible.

390
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:19,058
But you must have known
it was not a singular event.

391
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:20,993
It has evolved over decades.

392
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,095
We have measurements,
data and statistics

393
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:23,896
since the '70s.

394
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,397
Data.

395
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,766
Statistics.

396
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:30,013
I see another side to it.

397
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,538
Public Relations.

398
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,685
Don't belittle yourself.

399
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,743
I'm not prepared
to speak about it now.

400
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:40,679
Because you are trying to hide
a big conspiracy, Mr Riley?

401
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,093
Ah, I find that silly.

402
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:46,229
There is no reality...

403
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,355
there are only views of reality.

404
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,690
Only perceptions.

405
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,225
All collective anxieties

406
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,540
condense into
conspiracy theories.

407
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:00,243
My data is real.
There is a disaster.

408
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,968
Yes, and there are
three million Americans

409
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,639
who claim they have had
encounters with aliens.

410
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,108
Among them,
three hundred thousand women

411
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,410
who claim
that they have been abducted

412
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,258
and gang-raped by aliens.

413
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,684
Now this leads me
to two questions.

414
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,552
One...

415
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,723
Why do all these women
weigh over 350 pounds?

416
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:25,891
And, two...

417
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,394
Why have we never heard
of a single abducted woman

418
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:30,374
in Ethiopia?

419
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:31,908
Hm?

420
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:38,971
Of course the Diablo Blanco
Disaster exists.

421
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,140
And it is not static.

422
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,574
It is spreading.

423
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:46,745
And my delegation has been sent
to determine at what rate...

424
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,426
and make our findings public.

425
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,283
What prevents me from doing so

426
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,786
is that you have
taken me prisoner.

427
00:33:53,866 --> 00:34:01,760
I am prepared to accept
the consequences.

428
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,164
Even go to prison
for what I am doing.

429
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,499
I demand to be released!

430
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,501
Don't pressure me!

431
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:13,472
This could end very badly
for both of us.

432
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,086
Do you want to be a martyr?!

433
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:08,093
I'm Laura Sommerfeld.

434
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,828
I've been abducted.

435
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,464
I have been in a car...

436
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,645
at least two or three hours.

437
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:21,673
I do not know where I am,

438
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,409
<i>but I will play their game</i>

439
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,256
<i>to figure out what Riley wants.</i>

440
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:39,691
<i>Hola.</i>

441
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:45,709
Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth.

442
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:51,870
This magnificent specimen,
Mr. McMurphy, speaks.

443
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,106
What did it just say?

444
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,554
"Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth."

445
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:01,713
You know what Nostradamus said
about talking birds?

446
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,515
No. I do not read Nostradamus.

447
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,117
Hm.

448
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:09,388
He foretold what sounds
like science fiction today.

449
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:14,460
He said, "Household pets
finally communicate with man.

450
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,629
Life then possible
outside the planet.

451
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,511
A new tyrant sows terror.
Events to come."

452
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,070
A world run by big data
and predictive analytics

453
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,108
doesn't care
about Renaissance predictions.

454
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,811
I want to know
how Meier and Cavani are.

455
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,947
It's not so much
the predictions themselves

456
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,182
that fascinate me, it's...

457
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:40,953
where they come from.
Are they true?

458
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,256
Is it possible that there is
something all-pervading around us

459
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,258
which we
are incapable of seeing,

460
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:49,628
that your data can't analyze...

461
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,109
which only the prophets
and birds can express?

462
00:36:55,981 --> 00:37:00,405
He has the habit of saying it
at the oddest moments.

463
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:04,476
"Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth,

464
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,678
while the evil days come not,

465
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,981
nor the years draw nigh,

466
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,350
when thou shalt say,

467
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,897
I had no pleasure in them."

468
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,933
Ecclesiastes.

469
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:30,602
<i>You have done
research at the Institute</i>

470
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,205
for Developmental Biology
in Tubingen?

471
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,073
I worked with model organisms,

472
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,609
such as the zebra fish,
fruit flies,

473
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,145
and a form of cress
from the cabbage family.

474
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,713
Interesting.

475
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:45,117
It has been shown that genes
which influence development

476
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:47,219
work in a similar way
in different organisms,

477
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:51,023
be they flies, or people,
or cress.

478
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,091
And you are currently
doing research

479
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,327
at the Max Planck
Institute of Biochemistry

480
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:56,706
in Munich.

481
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,631
Technically yes.

482
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:03,079
But here, you are thrown back
into biochemistry.

483
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,673
Sometimes you do step back
in your life.

484
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,153
You don't seem pleased by this.

485
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,778
- Well...
- Your life...

486
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,079
as I have observed it,

487
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,682
seems to be a happy one for you.

488
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,362
There is someone's future
to care for.

489
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:24,022
What do you know about my life?

490
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,958
Are you not blessed
with a beautiful daughter?

491
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,704
Eight years old?

492
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:37,580
I'm... I'm sorry.

493
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,871
What a clumsy fool I am.

494
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:43,875
I find your treatment
of my colleagues and me clumsy.

495
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:47,446
Accepted. But for that,
I shall not apologize.

496
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:50,527
I've given up part of myself,
but not that.

497
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,869
How are Meier and Cavani?

498
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,398
If you have harmed
Meier or Cavani,

499
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,368
you will be tried before
an international tribunal

500
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,549
and you will suffer
severe punishment.

501
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,777
Can we finally talk business?

502
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,879
Mr. Krauss,
do I see you walking?

503
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,114
Yes, you do.

504
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,615
Is this a miracle?

505
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,286
No, I only use the wheelchair
when I am tired of life.

506
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,553
This is not the way
we should do it.

507
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,356
I propose we finish it now.
The moment of truth.

508
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,925
Not the entire truth.

509
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,327
If that moment is to ever come,

510
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:38,130
it will depend
on Professor Sommerfeld.

511
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,009
And on time.

512
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,780
How much time?

513
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,974
Truth...

514
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,688
is the only daughter of Time.

515
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:09,027
<i>I somehow
feel a threat out there.</i>

516
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:12,308
<i>I'm glad I have the distraction
of my data.</i>

517
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,214
<i>There is something strange</i>

518
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,217
<i>and potentially dangerous
about Riley.</i>

519
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:34,731
<i>I need to keep him talking.</i>

520
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,307
We have a lot of documentation

521
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:58,154
on the court proceedings
against animals.

522
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:02,625
Oh yeah, see.

523
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,250
A sow was sentenced to death

524
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,420
for killing and eating
a toddler.

525
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,934
The pig was burnt at the stake.

526
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,024
And here.

527
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,192
The salamander?

528
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:17,129
Oh yeah, the salamander was...

529
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,997
believed to originate from fire,

530
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:21,600
being a companion of the devil.

531
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,235
See, here it says,

532
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:27,539
"This salamander was exorcised
with a bucket of holy water.

533
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,185
Then burned."

534
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,758
I think I was meant
to live a different life.

535
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,568
Look in this silver column.

536
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,229
Wow.

537
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,598
I see, it's anamorphic art.

538
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,198
Yes.

539
00:41:57,249 --> 00:42:00,650
And this is
The Descent from the Cross.

540
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:04,476
You see,
this is what your situation

541
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,178
must look like to you,

542
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,091
unclear, contorted.

543
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:10,615
But if you move
one step further,

544
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,417
everything falls into place.

545
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,497
Everything makes sense.

546
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:17,656
At least, that's what I think.

547
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,459
It's a question of which angle
you choose to look from.

548
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:23,361
This sounds like a banality,
like-like...

549
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,264
Like what?
I am open to criticism.

550
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:29,267
Well, I don't want
to sound insulting,

551
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,470
but it sounds
like a shallow pseudo argument,

552
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,651
like "all Africans have rhythm
in their blood."

553
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,087
I bow to you.

554
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:45,383
May I be more precise about
different angles, perspectives?

555
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:46,930
Yes.

556
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:54,671
All my life... I've wanted
to see this in person.

557
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:03,112
Where is this cloister?

558
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,337
In Rome.

559
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:09,341
In the convent of
the Santissima Trinità.

560
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,988
Now, just look
along this corridor.

561
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:14,913
Completely normal.

562
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,961
A saint sitting under a tree.

563
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,496
But...

564
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,922
the nearer one approaches,
the more...

565
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:26,803
incomprehensible
the forms become.

566
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:29,872
Until...

567
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,175
Look at this.

568
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,933
The folds in the saint's cowl

569
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:39,070
become this vast
stretched out landscape.

570
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,006
The folds, in fact,
elongated like this,

571
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,908
become the Strait of Messina,

572
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,376
which the saint wanted to cross,

573
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:47,746
but the boatman
would not take him.

574
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:50,815
So he threw his coat
onto the water...

575
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,996
and surfed to Sicily.

576
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:00,069
Just imagine yourself
walking along this cloister.

577
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,307
<i>I have always dreamed of this.</i>

578
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:47,606
You know, the truth is

579
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:51,910
I don't really wanna be CEO
of the Consortium anymore...

580
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,123
or anything else,
for that matter.

581
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,927
That's why I live here.
It's a different life.

582
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:02,354
I'm trying to bring
who I really am into focus.

583
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:03,866
You see?

584
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,573
I would have offered you
these quarters

585
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:23,920
for your comfort,
but I couldn't.

586
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:27,512
Why is that?

587
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:30,582
Well. a hundred years ago...

588
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:33,785
the President of the Republic
died in this bed,

589
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:36,699
and it has to be kept this way
for all time.

590
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:43,005
There are so many
ancient things here.

591
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,978
May I be straightforward?

592
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,820
What do you want from me?

593
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,791
I kind of like you.

594
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:06,284
Me, as a person?

595
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:07,786
No.

596
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,365
As a woman?

597
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:12,257
I find you very attractive,

598
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:14,470
but there is something
beyond that.

599
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:30,375
I know I act
as if I know everything,

600
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:34,056
but allow me to ask
about your daughter again.

601
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:39,195
My apologies. If you do not wish
to speak, I fully understand.

602
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,256
I only took this assignment
because of my daughter.

603
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,056
In what sense?

604
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,061
I had to divert my thoughts.

605
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,164
I had to be occupied
by something.

606
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:57,068
I had to have a job
far out in the field.

607
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,048
This makes me curious.

608
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:04,409
My daughter has not been with me

609
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,355
for four years now.

610
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,712
Where is she?

611
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,550
She is in Morocco.

612
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,897
- Morocco?
- Yeah.

613
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,935
She's with
her biological father.

614
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:22,972
But I know that
you've never been married.

615
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,976
Her father took her back
to his country...

616
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,914
and he refuses to return her.

617
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:34,873
I have sued ever since,

618
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:38,487
but the Moroccan legal system
is very slow.

619
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:43,326
I'm sorry to hear that.

620
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:48,231
Having children invites tragedy.

621
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:52,235
You have children?

622
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:03,802
Are you afraid of something?

623
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:05,370
Do I look like it?

624
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,283
No. I apologize.

625
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,587
I used to be afraid
as a little boy.

626
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,558
Children who aren't afraid
scare me.

627
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:21,586
A little boy who isn't afraid
would cease to be a boy.

628
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:22,765
Hmm.

629
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:26,291
I used to be afraid of the dark,

630
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:27,792
but my grandmother told me

631
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:30,261
something that stuck with me
ever since.

632
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,696
She said,

633
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,332
"It's okay to be afraid
of the dark,

634
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,868
but the real tragedy in life...

635
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,482
is when men
are afraid of the light."

636
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,721
Get your bag.

637
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:55,458
- Where are we going?
- Get it now.

638
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,957
I demand to know
where we are going.

639
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,292
Get in the car.

640
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:10,762
No, I'm-I'm not leaving
without my colleagues.

641
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:11,596
Where are they?

642
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,898
Please do not embarrass me.

643
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,367
Tell me what's happened
to Dr. Meier and Dr. Cavani.

644
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,936
They are safe.

645
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,949
- And me?
- You are not.

646
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,648
I am your prisoner,
but as such, I would like to...

647
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:33,418
As much as you are,
I am a prisoner myself...

648
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,453
of my plans.

649
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:37,400
There is no way back now.

650
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:51,529
Where are we?

651
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,698
Only a short distance
from the very place

652
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:57,368
you traveled ten thousand miles
to see.

653
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,714
Lake Diablo Blanco.

654
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,042
Although these trains
were abandoned here

655
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,754
a hundred years ago...

656
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:08,513
time has
propelled them somewhere,

657
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:11,026
maybe even into the future.

658
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:14,252
Is there such a thing
as science fiction

659
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:16,387
that looks back in time
instead of ahead?

660
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,533
Certainly.

661
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,092
See, these trains,
they never had a purpose.

662
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:23,661
They had nothing to transport,
nowhere to go.

663
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,296
Aliens must have left them here.

664
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:26,964
Sure thing.

665
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:28,666
Can I take a picture?

666
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,502
Yes, as long as you keep my men
out of the frame.

667
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,871
Please do it quickly,
we have to move on.

668
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:36,574
- But the railroads...
- They are senseless.

669
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,377
They only allow us to go
from where we already are

670
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:41,357
to where we're no better off.

671
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,047
This is Uturuncu.

672
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,038
I thought it was important
you see it.

673
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,485
Uturuncu. The dormant volcano?

674
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,177
I know what your
field of study is, professor,

675
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,246
but there is something
much bigger looming

676
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:51,582
than the Diablo Blanco Disaster.

677
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:54,152
The entire area of Uturuncu,

678
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,420
thousands of square miles,

679
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,256
is lifting,

680
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,892
and the volcano itself
is rising and expanding

681
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:04,729
all at a rate that exceeds
any previous measurements.

682
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,131
In fact it is rising so rapidly

683
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:08,966
that we
are experiencing permanent,

684
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:10,902
round-the-clock tremors.

685
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,848
And what could happen?

686
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:16,518
You should ask
how fast it could happen.

687
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,544
It might happen
in 200 thousand years,

688
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:22,246
maybe in 20 thousand...

689
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,126
or maybe in twenty.

690
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:29,787
There's no point in asking
about nearby population.

691
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,556
When Uturuncu erupts,

692
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:35,860
our entire planet
will be obscured for decades.

693
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,229
It won't matter if you live
in the Arctic,

694
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,831
or the Himalayas, or Australia.

695
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:43,679
We will disappear as a species.

696
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:48,139
I am more concerned about
what we have created here.

697
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:49,840
Here and now.

698
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,945
A gigantic salt flat
that is expanding rapidly.

699
00:54:54,025 --> 00:54:55,824
So am I.

700
00:54:57,228 --> 00:55:02,431
But what may overtake it all
is the fire lying underneath.

701
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,502
We must face both.

702
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,705
Salt and fire.

703
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:16,367
Here lies a monster,
on the verge of waking.

704
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,902
My guess is one day soon

705
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:22,473
everyone will know
how to pronounce Uturuncu...

706
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:24,520
Uturuncu.

707
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,850
<i>This is my goal.</i>

708
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,785
To bring you here.

709
00:55:58,089 --> 00:56:01,345
But this is exactly where my
colleagues and I were heading.

710
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:03,592
What's the point of all this?

711
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:42,019
<i>I only had an abstract
idea how vast this is.</i>

712
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,354
<i>Just numbers.</i>

713
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:46,290
<i>The alarming thing is
the speed of its expansion.</i>

714
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,771
<i>Almost 800 square miles
per year.</i>

715
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,295
If it continues to grow,

716
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:54,498
the salt will cover
the entire continent one day.

717
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:56,033
I'm inclined to think
it could cover

718
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:58,002
all land mass on the planet.

719
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,537
Science Fiction.

720
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:02,206
I'd love to think that way.

721
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:03,441
Well, you know,
speaking of that,

722
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:06,410
this is the ideal landing site
for aliens.

723
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,381
Nothing on the planet
is so totally flat and so vast.

724
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:11,949
Even our satellites use it

725
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:14,663
to calibrate their distance
from the ground.

726
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:12,743
- So, this is Incahuasi Island.
- Put it on the ground.

727
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,111
Put it all down here.

728
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:15,424
I know it from maps.

729
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,784
I thought the world might see
the depth of this place

730
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:21,763
if you experience something new.

731
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,867
Meaning what?

732
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:27,803
What are they doing over there?

733
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:31,662
- Hey!
- Drive! Go!

734
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:34,376
Stop the car! Hey!

735
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:36,934
Open the door!

736
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:41,872
No, you can't leave me here!
Stop it!

737
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:43,151
Hey!

738
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,977
There are children there!
Are you mad?!

739
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:51,015
Are you crazy?!
You left children behind!

740
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:53,729
What am I supposed to do
with these kids?!

741
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:08,110
Who are you?
Huh?

742
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,069
Do you know why we are here?

743
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:13,448
Who are you?

744
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:15,973
Do you know those men?
Riley?

745
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,286
Do you know Riley?

746
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:21,345
Have you been here before?
You know this place?

747
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:22,658
Huh?

748
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:26,194
Can you see me?

749
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:29,097
Can you see me?

750
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:31,922
Do you understand me?

751
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:33,624
Can you understand me?

752
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:34,704
Huh?

753
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:38,696
Who are you?

754
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:41,410
I am Laura. Laura.

755
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,546
And you?
What is your name?

756
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,050
Laura.

757
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,140
Your name.

758
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,320
Huascar.

759
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:52,710
Huascar.

760
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,289
Huascar?

761
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,692
And the other boy?

762
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:00,162
The other boy?
Is he your brother?

763
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,254
Huh?

764
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:04,722
- Laura.
- Laura.

765
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:06,223
And what is your name?

766
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:08,025
Atahuallpa.

767
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,028
Ata-Atahuallpa?

768
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,030
Huascar. Laura.

769
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,910
Are you brothers?

770
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,748
Huascar? Atahuallpa?
The royal Inca brothers?

771
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:23,819
Have you been here before?

772
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,289
Do you know this island?

773
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:31,526
Hey.

774
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,663
Do you know this island?

775
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:54,905
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

776
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,019
That's all the water we have.

777
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:17,939
Come here.

778
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,713
Smell.

779
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,481
Onion.

780
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:29,851
In your language?

781
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:32,988
Do you like onion?

782
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:39,895
And now?

783
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:42,831
What do we do, huh?

784
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:50,572
We have to build a camp.

785
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,664
Let's do this together.

786
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,867
So, please, help me with this.

787
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,092
Unroll it.

788
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:23,638
Good.

789
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:27,442
And now unfold.

790
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:30,367
Very good.

791
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:34,805
And... one, two... three.

792
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,384
Very good.

793
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:40,822
Give me your hands.

794
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:45,315
Hold this.
Hold. Okay?

795
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:47,863
Hold still. Good boy.

796
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,466
Good job.

797
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:53,657
Thank you.

798
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:56,326
I need your help, too. Okay?

799
01:02:56,406 --> 01:02:57,539
Come with me.

800
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:02,210
Atahuallpa, hold it, please.

801
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:05,347
Stay here.

802
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,415
Stay here.

803
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:11,575
Stay here, stay here.

804
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:13,488
Don't move, don't move.

805
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,449
This is good now.

806
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,162
Don't move.

807
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:35,065
Good job.

808
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,445
Stand still. Good.

809
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:42,083
Now...

810
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,423
This is our home now.

811
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:30,487
<i>All we have
is food for about a week.</i>

812
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,656
<i>I worry about the water.</i>

813
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:35,837
<i>The salt absorbs
all the humidity.</i>

814
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:39,930
<i>We have blankets, toilet paper,</i>

815
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:43,678
<i>kitchen utensils, and a stove.</i>

816
01:04:57,995 --> 01:05:01,552
<i>We are trapped here.
In a vast expanse of salt.</i>

817
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:05,033
<i>No fences, no locked doors.</i>

818
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:10,727
<i>Getting away from the island
is impossible.</i>

819
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:12,362
<i>Returning to the shore</i>

820
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:16,544
<i>would mean a three day trek
across salt.</i>

821
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,300
Okay. Rice.

822
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:57,519
How do you call it?

823
01:05:58,155 --> 01:05:59,142
Hm?

824
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:01,111
<i>- Sal.
- Sal...</i>

825
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:03,091
Salt.

826
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,360
How about rice...

827
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:09,786
and some of the dried fish?

828
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:11,054
Hm?

829
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,768
Wow, you did a nice job
with the stove.

830
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:18,840
So...

831
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:39,549
- Laura.
- Yes?

832
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:41,349
- Laura.
- Hm?

833
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:46,368
Ah, I'm supposed to hold
my hand like this?

834
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,537
Wow!

835
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:51,261
Wow!

836
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:53,163
This is magic!

837
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,743
A magnet.

838
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:57,612
Wonderful.

839
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,758
<i>Considering the
circumstances, the night was good.</i>

840
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:38,495
One of the boys
talked in his sleep.

841
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:41,131
Why are we stranded here?

842
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:44,078
Why is Riley doing this to us?

843
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:47,148
How can we hold out?

844
01:10:00,564 --> 01:10:02,163
Huascar.

845
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:08,636
Ah, hm.

846
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:10,527
Is it good?

847
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:11,628
Hmm, yes.

848
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,130
<i>Si.</i>

849
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,264
<i>Ja?</i>

850
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,643
<i>Ja.</i>

851
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,780
Come here.

852
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,624
Like it?

853
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,125
Hm?

854
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,163
Atahuallpa.

855
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,521
Atahuallpa.

856
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:40,323
Huascar. Huascar.

857
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:41,703
Come here.

858
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,443
It's good. Huh?

859
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:56,818
Like it?

860
01:10:57,187 --> 01:10:58,219
Yeah?

861
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,355
Is it good?

862
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,807
We better save the water
for drinking.

863
01:11:23,246 --> 01:11:24,479
Come here.

864
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,589
Huascar.

865
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:16,464
Atahuallpa!

866
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:19,167
Huascar!

867
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:21,858
Atahuallpa, you stay here.

868
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:23,571
You stay here, okay?

869
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:28,265
What are you doing?

870
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:29,644
Hm?

871
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:34,148
You should hold
your brother's hand.

872
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:40,143
Are you okay?
Give me your hand.

873
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:41,389
Let's go.

874
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,647
Good.
One step to your right.

875
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,393
Big step there.

876
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:00,034
Do you hear anything?

877
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:03,171
Uturuncu.

878
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:14,081
I can hear something.

879
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:17,785
Very distant.
Like a faint grumbling.

880
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:22,645
The salt plain obviously behaves

881
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:25,393
like a gigantic membrane.

882
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:31,866
Are we sitting on a fire
that is moving beneath us?

883
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:03,086
My wish to have my scientific
instruments with me

884
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,899
is vanishing.

885
01:15:05,535 --> 01:15:07,891
The ocean of salt around me

886
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:11,428
changes my way of seeing things.

887
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:16,177
I find myself in a maze
of lines I do not comprehend.

888
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:20,147
Just like an alien planet.

889
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:23,718
<i>This is not of our world.</i>

890
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:49,670
<i>I wish the boys could see
what I see.</i>

891
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:55,743
<i>If I stretched out my hands,
I could harvest the stars.</i>

892
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:03,985
Good.

893
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,423
<i>Uno.</i>

894
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,425
Ooh!

895
01:17:13,363 --> 01:17:15,329
- Laura.
- Laura.

896
01:17:19,202 --> 01:17:21,602
Wow. Six.

897
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:23,927
Oh!

898
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:26,307
Feel. Feel.

899
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:28,209
Six.

900
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:31,467
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

901
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:33,114
Huascar.

902
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:43,591
- Wow!
<i>- Seis!</i>

903
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:46,093
Feel it.

904
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,633
Burry.

905
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:04,812
<i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.</i>

906
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:09,216
<i>Aqui. Cuatro.</i>

907
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:13,443
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
<i>- Uno, dos, tres...</i>

908
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:15,222
Oh, oh.

909
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:19,727
Atahuallpa.

910
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:23,164
Did you cheat?

911
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:24,832
<i>Ja?</i>

912
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,302
You go back with this, huh?

913
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:33,841
Four.

914
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,079
One, two, three, four.

915
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:40,514
Huascar.

916
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:59,389
Huascar, what did you do?

917
01:18:59,469 --> 01:19:00,469
Hm?

918
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,304
<i>- Si, Si.
- Ja, ja, ja, ja.</i>

919
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:06,929
You like cheating, huh?
You like cheating.

920
01:19:07,009 --> 01:19:08,476
Si.

921
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:32,355
Oh.

922
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,935
- Congratulations.
- Laura.

923
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:45,401
Come here.

924
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:47,537
You are two cheaters!

925
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:49,583
You are two cheaters.

926
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,676
I saw that you were
cheating on me.

927
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:55,678
Is that true?

928
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:57,046
Did you cheat on Laura?

929
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:00,683
All the time you were
cheating on Laura, huh?

930
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:03,264
You were cheating on me, you...

931
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,544
Hm?

932
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:44,627
I can't believe
it is already Tuesday.

933
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:47,408
Time makes no sense anymore.

934
01:20:48,444 --> 01:20:51,679
Here I am, stranded
with two blind boys.

935
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:13,122
<i>My former life has almost
completely disappeared.</i>

936
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:15,525
<i>I feel that I'm changing.</i>

937
01:21:15,605 --> 01:21:18,505
<i>But how, I do not know.</i>

938
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,546
No...

939
01:22:05,721 --> 01:22:06,854
No.

940
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:29,665
<i>What if
nobody comes to our rescue?</i>

941
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:33,480
<i>What do I tell the boys
when we run out of water?</i>

942
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:40,487
<i>They are totally unaware
of the impending danger.</i>

943
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:27,883
What are you doing?!

944
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,719
There's such little water left!

945
01:24:29,799 --> 01:24:31,687
Hey!
What did you do, huh?!

946
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,200
Hey!

947
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:37,771
I'm sorry.

948
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:41,208
Sorry, boys.

949
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:43,644
I'm sorry.

950
01:25:42,738 --> 01:25:44,505
I hear nothing.

951
01:26:14,703 --> 01:26:15,791
Niños!

952
01:26:15,871 --> 01:26:17,204
Here I am!

953
01:26:17,907 --> 01:26:18,994
Here I am!

954
01:26:19,074 --> 01:26:20,463
My boys.

955
01:26:20,543 --> 01:26:22,298
- Atahuallpa.
<i>- Hola, papa.</i>

956
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:24,333
Huascar. Hey, hey.

957
01:26:24,413 --> 01:26:27,103
- Papa!
- Oh! Oh!

958
01:26:27,183 --> 01:26:29,850
Oh! Oh.

959
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:35,923
Come closer.

960
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:39,560
You are part of the family now,
so to speak.

961
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:42,829
Are you kidding?

962
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:44,998
Are you kidding me?

963
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,344
Good to see you again,
Dr. Sommerfeld.

964
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:01,114
Nice to see you again, Krauss.

965
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,653
I want an explanation.

966
01:27:08,224 --> 01:27:09,778
Accepted.

967
01:27:09,858 --> 01:27:11,180
And an apology.

968
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,448
I will not apologize.

969
01:27:12,528 --> 01:27:13,782
I deserve an apology.

970
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:17,030
You are with a man who is
accepting he is going to prison.

971
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,622
How are my companions

972
01:27:19,702 --> 01:27:22,391
you have so kindly kidnapped
and poisoned?

973
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:24,504
They are in excellent shape...

974
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:27,040
Professor.

975
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:28,797
Thank God.

976
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:32,334
Well, there is one grave
concern with Dr. Cavani.

977
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,270
He is grown slightly pale

978
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:36,416
and needs to be sent
to a tanning salon.

979
01:27:40,656 --> 01:27:42,389
These boys...

980
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,058
they are my sons.

981
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:49,768
Their mother died

982
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:52,488
shortly after she gave birth
to the younger one, Atahuallpa.

983
01:27:52,568 --> 01:27:55,591
She died because of the
toxicity of the environment

984
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:57,560
around the town.

985
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,073
She was a local woman
from Colchani.

986
01:28:01,143 --> 01:28:03,566
These boys are mine now.

987
01:28:03,646 --> 01:28:06,580
I adopted them
after their mother died.

988
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:12,486
And in three years
they will be completely blind.

989
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:17,057
Blind children have no stake
in any regime.

990
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:24,398
What does it have to do with
my report on Diablo Blanco?

991
01:28:27,236 --> 01:28:29,903
This disaster is man-made.

992
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:33,195
- Of course it is.
- No.

993
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:34,941
Let me speak.

994
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,502
You see, I am the CEO
of the Consortium,

995
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:43,350
which is responsible
for all of this.

996
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:46,108
The toxins,

997
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:48,077
the desiccation of the lake,

998
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:51,947
the transformation
of a whole landscape...

999
01:28:52,027 --> 01:28:54,194
into salt.

1000
01:28:56,565 --> 01:29:00,222
The failure of a "glorious"
irrigation system

1001
01:29:00,302 --> 01:29:03,203
which diverted two large rivers.

1002
01:29:04,573 --> 01:29:07,574
Both of which
are now beyond repair.

1003
01:29:09,311 --> 01:29:11,945
And the salt here is expanding.

1004
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:17,918
There were fish here...

1005
01:29:18,787 --> 01:29:23,112
a few decades ago.
Boats. Fishermen.

1006
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:25,125
Hard to imagine, isn't it?

1007
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:28,250
But I was prepared
to report on this.

1008
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:30,819
Why did you take me hostage?

1009
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:33,555
I wanted a report
back to the United Nations

1010
01:29:33,635 --> 01:29:36,292
that contained something more
than scientific data,

1011
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:39,406
graphs and lifeless statistics.

1012
01:29:40,442 --> 01:29:43,577
A report with
something different in it.

1013
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:50,183
A report of a lake
so poisonous...

1014
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:55,322
that two boys who grew up
near its shores became blind!

1015
01:29:59,328 --> 01:30:02,996
They will never see
a world like this again.

1016
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:26,386
And now, before I turn myself
in to the authorities...

1017
01:30:28,223 --> 01:30:30,724
please allow me two things.

1018
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,566
And this is number one.

1019
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:44,504
Number One.

1020
01:30:46,842 --> 01:30:50,699
Laura, can I call you
by your first name?

1021
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,379
Of course.

1022
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:57,740
Please bring me...
your tablet...

1023
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:00,887
a toy, and a spoon.

1024
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,424
My tablet...

1025
01:31:05,093 --> 01:31:07,227
a toy, and a spoon?

1026
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:09,429
Yes.

1027
01:31:09,698 --> 01:31:11,164
Okay.

1028
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:14,456
Okay, Laura,
take a step to the left.

1029
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:16,458
Tiny. Right. Good. Okay.

1030
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:18,761
Hold your arms up.

1031
01:31:18,841 --> 01:31:20,629
Okay, now, elbows to hips.

1032
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:22,631
- Like that?
- Right, and your hands flat.

1033
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:24,711
Like this. Okay...

1034
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:29,082
One... two... three.

1035
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:34,977
Okay, crouch down.

1036
01:31:35,057 --> 01:31:36,478
Crouch down.

1037
01:31:36,558 --> 01:31:38,358
Okay, now hold still.

1038
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:41,575
Perfect, perfect.

1039
01:31:42,764 --> 01:31:44,453
Laura, a little bit to the left.

1040
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:46,622
That's good, okay.

1041
01:31:46,702 --> 01:31:48,857
Put your back foot up!

1042
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:50,559
Ah, that's good.

1043
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:51,872
Okay, scream!

1044
01:31:56,512 --> 01:32:00,736
These photos will
keep me company in prison.

1045
01:32:00,816 --> 01:32:03,116
That's why I wanted them,
you see.

1046
01:32:05,821 --> 01:32:09,055
And here is the second thing
I wanted to do.

1047
01:32:10,325 --> 01:32:12,259
- It's for me?
- Yes.

1048
01:32:17,366 --> 01:32:19,455
A ticket to Rome?

1049
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:21,234
First class?

1050
01:32:23,272 --> 01:32:26,239
Have you forgotten
Santissima Trinità?

1051
01:32:28,243 --> 01:32:30,577
The saint under the tree?

1052
01:32:31,813 --> 01:32:33,179
Right.

1053
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:45,258
But what if you do not
turn yourself in?

1054
01:32:49,431 --> 01:32:51,298
I'll be caught anyway.

1055
01:32:53,001 --> 01:32:56,358
Then go on the run...
to Rome.

1056
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:58,772
I guess that's where
I'm going to be.

1057
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:09,883
I don't know what to say.

1058
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:16,545
Why are you standing here?

1059
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:18,925
Book yourself a ticket.

1060
01:33:21,263 --> 01:33:24,353
Guys, guys, I have
a premonition about this.

1061
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:26,889
We have to celebrate
with champagne.

1062
01:33:26,969 --> 01:33:28,156
All that's missing

1063
01:33:28,236 --> 01:33:31,059
are alien astronauts
from a faraway galaxy,

1064
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:32,628
traveling for centuries

1065
01:33:32,708 --> 01:33:34,530
through the eternal darkness
of space.

1066
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,698
They see
this white heaven below,

1067
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:38,433
and they descended
their space craft

1068
01:33:38,513 --> 01:33:41,537
with flickering lights
in a cloud of salt.

1069
01:33:41,617 --> 01:33:42,871
Wonderful.

1070
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:45,340
But how do we attract them?

1071
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,076
We need some kind
of satellite transmission.

1072
01:33:48,156 --> 01:33:49,545
Nonsense.

1073
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:51,825
The champagne will be the bait.
