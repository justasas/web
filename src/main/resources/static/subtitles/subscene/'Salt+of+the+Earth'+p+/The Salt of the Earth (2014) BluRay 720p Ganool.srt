Maybe it was dead.

661
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,832
But the man was
holding on and on...

662
00:53:31,931 --> 00:53:34,952
Yet when he reached the
doctors, his child was dead.

663
00:53:37,293 --> 00:53:38,928
After such a long march.

664
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:50,676
Doctors Without Borders
had to give up this camp.

665
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:54,156
Water is essential
in these camps...

666
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:56,085
and it had
become a huge problem.

667
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:59,360
So they had to move the camp
as fast as possible.

668
00:54:03,703 --> 00:54:08,066

crammed into UN trucks...

669

fertile piece of land...

water by the Nile,

677

the people died...

679
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:50,308

680
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,264
They were in the final stages
of their distress.

681
00:54:57,083 --> 00:55:01,332
They'd forgotten to bring
food, or hadn't been able to.

682
00:55:01,484 --> 00:55:04,302

had gone wrong.

683

held on so long...

684

they could no more.

685
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:23,165
I went to Mali.

686

01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,888
150 kilometers
of dead bodies...

859
01:07:08,635 --> 01:07:11,972
I turned back, because my
story was about people.

860
01:07:12,117 --> 01:07:16,242
I was doing my book on refugees,
I was working on Exodus-

861
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:19,064
I started going
into the camps...

862
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:20,794
and I began to see...

863
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,651
the sheer number of people
leaving Rwanda.

864
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:29,697
Hell was taking
the place of paradise.

865
01:07:31,004 --> 01:07:33,224
It was frightening...

866
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:36,932
to see, on such
a beautiful savanna...

867
01:07:37,046 --> 01:07:40,146
this mega city springing up.

868
01:07:42,608 --> 01:07:46,136
Within days, there were
almost a million people here.

869
01:07:53,372 --> 01:07:57,384
Among all this distress, one
thing that really moved me...

870
01:07:57,534 --> 01:08:00,904
was the relationship between
this mother and her child...

871
01:08:01,014 --> 01:08:04,666
and the child's
trust in its mother.

872
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:19,690
Violence...

873
01:08:20,382 --> 01:08:22,050
and brutality...

874
01:08:22,142 --> 01:08:25,513
are not the monopoly...

875
01:08:25,624 --> 01:08:27,653
of remote countries.

876
01:08:27,745 --> 01:08:30,958
It happened right here, in
Europe, in ex-Yugoslavia.

877
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:33,208
It was very shocking.

878
01:08:35,748 --> 01:08:39,716
A bus coming from Krajina
through Croatia...

879
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,373
a person was killed
through that hole.

880
01:08:43,471 --> 01:08:47,439
<i>The Croats killed lots of people
too as they left Krajina.</i>

881
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:50,025
Violence was everywhere.

882
01:08:50,113 --> 01:08:53,528
But what disgusted me most...

883
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:57,445
was to see how
contagious hatred was.

884
01:08:58,276 --> 01:09:01,094
These people too saw violence.

885
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,516
Entire families...

886
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:06,053
the whole Serbian population
of Krajina was expelled.

887
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,663
And overnight,
they found themselves...

888
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:15,808
evicted from their homes,
looking for a place to go...

889
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:19,451
having their next-door
neighbors shooting at them.

890
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,193
These were refugee camps
not far from Tuzla...

891
01:09:38,891 --> 01:09:41,912
in central Bosnia.

892
01:09:42,013 --> 01:09:45,067
These families had left
the enclave of Zepa...

893
01:09:45,173 --> 01:09:49,107
where Serbs murdered
thousands of young men.

894
01:09:50,136 --> 01:09:51,928
We were there at
the very moment

895
01:09:52,016 --> 01:09:54,834
when the families
were arriving...

896
01:09:55,898 --> 01:09:58,525
in a state of great distress.

897
01:10:09,863 --> 01:10:12,568
There were only women,
old men...

898
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:14,773
and children.

899
01:10:14,905 --> 01:10:18,996
The younger men had all
been held and murdered.

900
01:10:25,469 --> 01:10:28,490
It was strange that this
was happening in Europe...

901
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:31,572
at the end of
the 20th century.

902
01:10:32,111 --> 01:10:33,622
From the cars alone...

903
01:10:33,712 --> 01:10:37,646
you can see these people
had a standard of living...

904
01:10:37,753 --> 01:10:40,019
a European
standard of living...

905
01:10:40,114 --> 01:10:42,978
a European
intellectual level...

906
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:45,375
a European infrastructure.

907
01:10:45,476 --> 01:10:47,348
And they lost everything.

908
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:55,294
Hundreds of kilometers,
crowded with people and cars.

909
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:01,349
We are a ferocious animal.

910
01:11:01,442 --> 01:11:04,260
We humans are
terrible animals.

911
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:09,535
Here in Europe, in Africa, in
South America, everywhere...

912
01:11:09,685 --> 01:11:12,312
we are extremely violent.

913
01:11:19,249 --> 01:11:21,436
Our history is
a history of wars.

914
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:30,241
It's an endless story...

915
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:32,441
a story of repression...

916
01:11:32,534 --> 01:11:34,202
a tale of madness.

917
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:46,041
The situation in
Rwanda kept changing.

918
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:50,231
The Hutu army, which was ruling
the country, was defeated...

919
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:55,299
and retreated into the Congo,
to the Goma region.

920
01:11:56,743 --> 01:12:01,263
First, the Tutsis had fled
the Hutu barbarity.

921
01:12:01,424 --> 01:12:03,330
And then, the Hutus...

922
01:12:03,425 --> 01:12:05,972
fled the Tutsi occupation.

923
01:12:06,066 --> 01:12:08,174
So everybody fled, in turn.

924
01:12:11,388 --> 01:12:13,260
In just a few days...

925
01:12:13,349 --> 01:12:16,325
in July 1994...

926
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:17,783
the Goma region...

927
01:12:17,871 --> 01:12:20,847
received more than
2 million people.

928
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:25,054
It was a disaster
in the making.

929
01:12:28,075 --> 01:12:30,972
Diseases such as cholera
started spreading...

930
01:12:31,076 --> 01:12:35,247
and the people
began to die like ants.

931
01:12:35,357 --> 01:12:38,377
12 to 15 thousand
died every day.

932
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,463
I was taking photos
of these piles of corpses...

933
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:49,058
when I saw the dad
coming with his kid.

934
01:12:49,162 --> 01:12:50,673
He threw him on the pile...

935
01:12:50,763 --> 01:12:55,091
and left with his friend, chatting
as if nothing had happened.

936
01:13:01,807 --> 01:13:04,940
They couldn't
bury all the people.

937
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,023
So a bulldozer came
from the French army...

938
01:13:09,129 --> 01:13:13,018
which took dozens at a time...

939
01:13:13,131 --> 01:13:15,194
laid them out on the ground...

940
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:17,998
and covered them with earth.

941
01:13:35,379 --> 01:13:38,163
Everybody should
see these images...

942
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,157
to see how
terrible our species is.

943
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:51,115
Orphan kids,
who were on the road.

944
01:13:53,106 --> 01:13:54,537
Three children...

945
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:58,240
the two with the livelier eyes
would live.

946
01:13:58,348 --> 01:14:02,316
The one whose eyes
are clouded was dying.

947
01:14:05,031 --> 01:14:08,007
When I got out of there,
I was ill...

948
01:14:08,112 --> 01:14:10,659
my body was very sick.

949
01:14:10,752 --> 01:14:14,439
I didn't have any
infectious diseases...

950
01:14:14,554 --> 01:14:16,503
but my soul was sick.

951
01:14:21,397 --> 01:14:25,444
I went back to Rwanda
one year after the disaster...

952
01:14:25,558 --> 01:14:30,754
to cover the return of the Hutus
who'd been in the Congo...

953
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,475
and had nowhere to go.

954
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:37,047
The United Nations started
forcing them to return.

955
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:52,212
You felt the whole planet was
covered with refugee tents.

956
01:15:05,453 --> 01:15:07,515
After working there...

957
01:15:07,613 --> 01:15:12,179
the Tutsi authorities
suggested that I should see...

958
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:16,184
a few of the places where
the massacres had occurred.

959
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:27,775
People had fled to a church,
believing they'd be safe.

960
01:15:28,621 --> 01:15:31,000
All murdered!

961
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:40,122
Here, it happened in a school.

962
01:15:40,306 --> 01:15:45,029
You can still see what was written
on the blackboard that day.

963
01:15:45,188 --> 01:15:47,217
It was terrifying.

964
01:16:01,194 --> 01:16:05,399
The people who had left Rwanda,
about 2 million refugees...

965
01:16:05,515 --> 01:16:08,175
some went back to Rwanda...

966
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:10,982
but others were
afraid of the repression.

967
01:16:11,077 --> 01:16:16,160
So a column of about 250,000
people left the city of Goma...

968
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:18,545
and entered the Congo forest.

969
01:16:21,681 --> 01:16:22,955
We lost track of them.

970
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:27,010
Everybody knew there were
250,000 lost people.

971
01:16:27,164 --> 01:16:29,069
Nobody knew where they were.

972
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:33,675
Six months later...

973
01:16:34,246 --> 01:16:38,845
they started appearing near Kisangani,
in the center of the Congo.

974
01:16:41,289 --> 01:16:44,941
They'd lived in
the forest for 6 months.

975
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:51,208
So the UN took me there.

976
01:16:52,533 --> 01:16:55,587
There was a train
and I took it.

977
01:16:56,774 --> 01:17:00,111
It was dropping off food,
then heading back.

978
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,120
But I said, "I'm staying."

979
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,088
(BRAKE SQUEALING,
STEAM HISSING)

980
01:17:07,779 --> 01:17:12,772
I spent three days with these
people, who kept arriving.

981
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,488
Columns and columns of them...

982
01:17:17,982 --> 01:17:21,353
To think that when they left
they were 250,000...

983
01:17:21,464 --> 01:17:24,485
and only 40,000 made it here!

984
01:17:24,585 --> 01:17:28,271
210,000 people were missing!

985
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:41,057
Yet at the same time,
life went on.

986
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:45,322
A guy cutting hair...

987
01:17:46,593 --> 01:17:49,050
Or even this Congolese guy...

988
01:17:49,194 --> 01:17:50,986
with his calculator...

989
01:17:51,995 --> 01:17:55,049
who was trying to collect...

990
01:17:55,196 --> 01:17:59,164
the few dollars he was
sure people had on them...

991
01:17:59,278 --> 01:18:03,043
which he was trying to exchange,
in the middle of nowhere!

992
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:06,180
In the middle of
a remote forest.

993
01:18:13,362 --> 01:18:14,513
At that time...

994
01:18:15,203 --> 01:18:19,723
the pro-Tutsi guerilla movement
that had seized Kisangani...

995
01:18:19,845 --> 01:18:22,505
began to expel
these people again...

996
01:18:22,606 --> 01:18:24,117
to send them back.

997
01:18:24,207 --> 01:18:28,615
Six months to get there,
and now back to Rwanda!

998
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:30,916
They began to
kill some of them.

999
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:36,214
There, I met people who just
couldn't take any more.

1000
01:18:37,132 --> 01:18:39,916
Who started to be delirious...

1001
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:42,003
losing their minds...

1002
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:43,604
They were driven mad.

1003
01:18:48,936 --> 01:18:52,544
In fact, those people
who were expelled...

1004
01:18:52,738 --> 01:18:55,083
were never heard from again.

1005
01:18:56,459 --> 01:18:58,916
I believe they
were all murdered.

1006
01:19:06,703 --> 01:19:12,023
That was my last trip, that
disastrous time in Rwanda.

1007
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:17,649
When I left there...

1008
01:19:19,308 --> 01:19:21,416
l no longer
believed in anything,

1009
01:19:21,508 --> 01:19:24,090
in any salvation
for the human species.

1010
01:19:24,189 --> 01:19:26,895
You couldn't
survive such a thing.

1011
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:28,782
We didn't deserve to live.

1012
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,816
No one deserved to live.

1013
01:19:41,036 --> 01:19:45,951
How many times did I lay my cameras
down to cry over what I'd seen?

1014
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:55,967
<i>WENDERS: Sebastião had seen
into the heart of darkness</i>

1015
01:19:56,641 --> 01:20:00,496
<i>and deeply questioned his work
as a social photographer</i>

1016
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:03,229
<i>and a witness of
the human condition.</i>

1017
01:20:04,044 --> 01:20:07,494
<i>What was left for
him to do after Rwanda?</i>

1018
01:20:15,449 --> 01:20:19,338
<i>JULIANO: In that time, my
grandfather's health had worsened.</i>

1019
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:24,545
<i>My parents had to return to
Brazil to take care of the farm.</i>

1020
01:20:25,372 --> 01:20:27,954
<i>It was nothing
but a wasteland.</i>

1021
01:20:28,053 --> 01:20:30,556
<i>They didn't know
what to do with it.</i>

1022
01:20:31,215 --> 01:20:35,499
<i>The birds, the alligators and
the majestic forests were gone.</i>

1023
01:20:35,616 --> 01:20:39,628
<i>There was nothing left from
Sebastião's childhood memories.</i>

1024
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:46,874
<i>And then Lélia came up
with a surprising idea.</i>

1025
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:51,269
<i>"Why don't we replant the
forest that was here before?"</i>

1026
01:20:53,742 --> 01:20:55,614
<i>WENDERS: The forest
that was there before</i>

1027
01:20:55,703 --> 01:20:58,487
<i>and had once spread
over all these hills</i>

1028
01:20:58,584 --> 01:21:02,395
<i>was Mata Atlantica,
the Atlantic rain forest.</i>

1029
01:21:03,626 --> 01:21:06,208
<i>Nobody had ever
tried to replant it,</i>

1030

01:33:03,934 --> 01:33:07,305
They respect each other.

1199
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:12,094
And when you visit them,
you have to be polite...

1200
01:33:12,258 --> 01:33:14,840
to stand in a certain way...

1201
01:33:14,939 --> 01:33:17,723

respect their territory.

1202
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,199
And then you're welcomed.

1203
01:33:21,902 --> 01:33:25,396
I also befriended a whale.

1204
01:33:29,505 --> 01:33:31,771
These are whales...

1205
01:33:33,386 --> 01:33:34,738
in Argentina.

1206
01:33:37,387 --> 01:33:40,961
An adult like this is 35 meters
long, weighs about 40 tons.

1207
01:33:42,189 --> 01:33:44,534
She came so
close to the boat...

1208
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:46,812
I could touch her.

1209
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,616
And it was incredible.
Such sensitive skin!

1210
01:33:49,712 --> 01:33:51,301
As I was caressing her...

1211
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:55,800
I could see her tail, 35
meters away, trembling.

1212
01:33:55,914 --> 01:33:57,503
Incredible sensitivity.

1213
01:33:58,155 --> 01:34:02,439
We had a small boat,
just 7 meters long.

1214
01:34:02,997 --> 01:34:05,703
She knew she
could have sunk us.

1215
01:34:05,798 --> 01:34:08,616
But she never once
hit the boat. Not once!

1216
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,819
As we left,
she began tapping her tail...

1217
01:34:55,696 --> 01:34:57,996
That's like another planet!

1218
01:34:58,097 --> 01:35:00,396
It's quite incredible.

1219
01:35:00,498 --> 01:35:05,143
Let me see if I have another
photo of the Nenets.

1220
01:35:06,461 --> 01:35:10,349
See, everything
a Nenet owns is here.

1221
01:35:11,823 --> 01:35:13,141
That's their house.

1222
01:35:17,705 --> 01:35:21,391
I'd been planning this work
on the Nenets for a long time.

1223
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:26,671
About eighteen people,
with six thousand reindeer...

constantly migrating.

1225
01:35:31,149 --> 01:35:34,204
This must be about
seven in the evening.

1226
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:37,411
At about eight in the evening
they'd light a fire...

1227
01:35:37,512 --> 01:35:40,251
and cook the only
hot meal of the day.

1228
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:44,609
After the meal, we'd chat a bit.
Everybody talked.

1229
01:35:44,715 --> 01:35:46,226
They'd put out the fire.

1230
01:35:46,316 --> 01:35:52,267
While the fire was burning, it was
15 to 20 degrees, quite nice.

1231
01:35:52,438 --> 01:35:54,940
Two hours later,
it was minus thirty.

1232
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,570
They're the real
cowboys of Siberia.

1233
01:36:01,681 --> 01:36:04,387
They always
have their lasso...

1234
01:36:04,482 --> 01:36:07,582
made of reindeer skin,
around their necks.

1235
01:36:08,523 --> 01:36:13,326
They have boots made
of silver-fox skin.

1236
01:36:14,205 --> 01:36:17,655
They sleep with them.
Those boots last a lifetime.

1237

1239

At this spot, it's about
47 kilometers wide.

1240
01:36:45,898 --> 01:36:49,989
Once past the Ob,
you're in the Arctic Circle.
