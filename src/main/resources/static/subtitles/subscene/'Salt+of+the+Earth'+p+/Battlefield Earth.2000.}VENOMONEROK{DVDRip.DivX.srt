2
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,634
The entire tribe must not
be endangered. . .

3
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,261
. . .because of the defiance of
one person.

4
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,930
You must forget about him.

5
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,558
He was a wild spirit and this was
always to be his fate.

6
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,520
You talk as if he's already dead

7
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,446
Even if he does survive this time,
he's a greener. . .

8
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,157
. . .so set your sights elsewhere
for a husband.

9
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,868
I'll never set my sights elsewhere.

10
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,155
-This is all the medicine I could find.
-I'm sorry.

11
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,242
The gods took your father
in the night.

12
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,021
As long as we stay here, there'll
never be enough to eat. Never.

13
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,400
There may be other places
we could live where food is plentiful.

14
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,029
All it takes is one demon to follow
you back from the forbidden land.

15
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,864
Then we'd all be struck down.

16
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,574
Have you ever seen one?

17
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,075
Have you?

18
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,244
Has anyone here ever seen one?

19
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,704
A demon?

20
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,289
A monster!

21
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,707
A beast!

22
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,795
The stories are true.

23
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,590
The gods used to live here.

24
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:21,094
They watched over and protected man,
but man grew selfish. . .

25
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,430
. . .and cruel. So the gods left. . .

26
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,141
. . .allowing the demons
to descend from the sky.

27
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:35,234
As survivors, we must dedicate
our lives to pleasing the gods. . .

28
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:39,238
. . .so that one day they will come back
and drive away the demons.

29
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,116
That is our fate.

30
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,246
Only if you believe in fate.

31
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,271
I'm sorry. I can't take you.

32
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,481
I can't handle myself
as well as a man?

33
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,608
-No.
-You arrogant greener.

34
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,695
You can handle yourself
better than most men. . .

35
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,489
. . .which is why you need
to help the village.

36
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,290
Your mother gave this to me
before she died.

37
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,792
She hoped it'd be passed
to your children.

38
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,173
It's for good luck.

39
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,601
Don't let anything happen
to you out there.

40
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:34,978
Easy!

41
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,027
Easy!

42
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,014
So you're the beast
we're all afraid of.

43
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,042
Not a lot of meat on a dragon.

44
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,719
You have been fortunate in the hunt.

45
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,054
I hope you thanked the gods.

46
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,225
-A nonbeliever.
-I believe what I can see.

47
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,522
A nonbeliever, huh?
You from the caves?

48
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,275
Probably never seen a god.
Would you like to?

49
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,904
-What do you know about gods?
-We've seen gods. Rock and l.

50
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,697
You lying thieves.

51
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,994
Wait a minute.

52
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,747
Wait a minute, we're hunting.

53
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,041
No time to show you gods with no food.

54
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,794
We need food. We must hunt.
Nonbeliever.

55
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,466
Wait.

56
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,352
First you show me the god.

57
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,687
Then we eat.

58
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,613
Look.

59
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,990
Frozen ones.

60
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,786
The way to the great god village
is marked by these frozen ones.

61
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,082
When the gods left this world,
they ordered man not to look at them.

62
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,253
Those that disobeyed were
frozen in place for all of eternity.

63
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,548
When the gods lived here
they could fly through the air.

64
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:12,261
They'd drive chariots in front
of special caves with golden arches.

65
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:13,804
Golden.

66
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,598
And the food would magically appear.

67
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,891
Magic.

68
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,309
Here!

69
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:24,606
The gods weren't allowed to fall
in love with mortal women.

70
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,608
This one did. . .

71
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,820
. . .and was left behind,
frozen as punishment.

72
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,492
Are you sure this was a god?

73
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,203
I thought you said you believe
what you can see.

74
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,799
If you need proof. . .

75
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:54,845
. . .when the sun goes down, you can see
the rest of the gods in the sky.

76
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,930
They're the bright lights.

77
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,186
The evil beasts hunt in the dark.
We need to find shelter.

78
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,354
There's a cave over here.

79
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,780
Look at those poor bastards.
They really angered the gods.

80
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,157
Carlo.

81
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,159
Let's eat.

82
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,717
Go. Go.

83
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,567
What's a "greener"?

84
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,945
The grass is greener
on the other side.

85
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,282
Always looking for something better,
something out there.

86
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,742
Maybe she was right.

87
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,249
God stone.

88
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,876
Sharp.

89
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,296
No, you keep it. You keep it.

90
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:15,425
Where we're from, a good woman
is a hard thing to find.

91
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:19,012
So if you were stupid enough
to leave a good woman behind. . .

92
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,933
. . .why don't you tell me where she is
so I can go get her for myself?

93
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,142
No!

94
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,812
Forget about me.
Get out of here. I can't move!

95
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,493
No!

96
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,374
Oh, heavenly gods!

97
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,579
Don't breathe the air!

98
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,122
It's poison!

99
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,129
My chest is on fire!

100
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,724
It helps you breathe. Take it!

101
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,226
I can't!

102
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,232
Get off my brother.

103
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,761
-What's he saying?
-Don't know.

104
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,223
Who's responsible for allowing
him to run around?

105
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,308
He shot the wrangler.

106
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:27,608
I'm a little pressed for time.
Save the going-away jokes for later.

107
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,776
No joke, sir. I swear.

108
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,487
The man-animal
got ahold of this gun.

109
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,239
Really?

110
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,742
Show me.

111
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,577
Sir?

112
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,208
Reach for the gun.

113
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,126
But, sir, I might get shot.

114
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,713
Sure, you might. And I might
suddenly grow a third arm!

115
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:51,256
But it shot the wrangler.

116
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,510
Any report filed today
still has my name on it. . .

117
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,472
. . .and you are out of your skull-bone
if you think I'm going to write. . .

118
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,142
. . . "shot by a man-animal" as the
cause of death unless I see it!

119
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,770
If I obey your command,
I may get killed.

120
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,689
If you don't, it's a certainty
you will be killed.

121
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:09,858
Reach for the gun.

122
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,997
Well, I'll be damned.

123
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,416
Teleportation sequence activated.

124
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,670
Teleportation sequence activated.

125
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,279
It is a pleasure to see you,
Your Excellency.

126
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,825
I would be honored to expedite
your clearance through security.

127
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,453
Please, call me Zete.
Does all of Earth look like this?

128
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,747
I'm afraid so, sir.

129
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:33,752
Pathetic. All the green
and the blue sky.

130
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,756
They told me this planet was ugly,
but this is one of the ugliest. . .

131
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,843
-. . .in the entire universe.
-I couldn't agree more.

132
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:45,472
I hate these puny, undersized planets.
The gravity is so different.

133
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,474
One does get used to it.

134
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,727
And the human-animals,
grossly undersized.

135
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,397
They don't make good eating,
Your Excellency.

136
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,983
-My executive assistant, Ker.
-Thank you.

137
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,070
He has been fully trained
to replace me as chief of security.

138
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,032
-As soon as my transfer goes through.
-Well, Ker. . .

139
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:07,619
. . .once we finish mining out
this miserable little planet. . .

140
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,746
. . .Iet's do the universe a favor.

141
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,374
Let's exterminate the lot of them.

142
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,754
-Oh, you're too much.
-So they tell me.

143
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,882
Please, come this way.

144
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,096
Spy satellites recorded those.

145
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,600
-What is this species?
-According to the Clinko historians. . .

146
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,435
. . .the species is called "dog. "

147
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,395
-Dog.
-Yes.

148
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:37,107
Obviously the superior race,
having the man-animal chauffeur.

149
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:42,154
Well, dogs did prove to be
more cooperative than the man-animals.

150
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,574
They weren't as useful
when it came to manual labor.

151
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:51,538
I am honored by your visit,
Your Excellency.

152
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:52,915
Thank you, Planetship.

153
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:56,293
You'll be pleased. I approved
additional labor resources.

154
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:58,879
They'll be here
by the end of quarter cycle.

155
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,797
Thank you, Your Excellency.

156
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,050
Now, let's see.

157
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,514
Your long overdue transfer.

158
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,101
You must be looking forward to getting
off this disgusting excuse of a planet.

159
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:17,439
I just want to do whatever serves
the corporation best, sir.

160
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,400
Very admirable.
And I must say, you've done. . .

161
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:23,570
. . .a first-rate job here
as interim security chief.

162
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,073
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

163
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,825
I do what I can.

164
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:31,078
So we've decided to keep you
for another tour of service.

165
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,793
There must be some mistake.

166
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,796
Home Office does not make mistakes.

167
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:43,340
Of course not.
But have you looked at my file?

168
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:47,386
It explicitly says that this
is a temporary assignment.

169
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:56,854
Are you not aware that I graduated
top of my class?

170
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,397
Quite an accomplishment.

171
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,775
I don't mean to second-guess
the Home Office. . .

172
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,528
. . .but surely I could be
of better service--

173
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:09,533
Home Office is well aware of your
academic achievements and talents.

174
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:14,204
That's why we've decided not to keep
you here for another five cycles.

175
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,086
It's a joke.

176
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:24,590
Thank you, sir.

177
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,385
I don't know if I
could've kept my sanity. . .

178
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,554
. . .to be here another five cycles.

179
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:34,600
We've decided to keep you here
for another 50 cycles!

180
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,520
With endless options for renewal!

181
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,923
Those options, of course. . .

182
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,550
. . .being at Home Office's discretion.

183
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,010
Not yours.

184
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,347
The senator. . .

185
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,142
. . .has a lot of friends.

186
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,526
Would you please tell the senator. . .

187
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,654
. . .if I'd had even an inkling that
that was his daughter--

188
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,364
Watch your tongue.

189
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:36,245
The senator's exact words to me were,
and I'm quoting:

190
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,289
"If that blasted Terl tries
to talk his way out of it. . .

191
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:41,834
. . .have him vaporized on the spot. "

192
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,673
But cheer up.
There's one bright side to this.

193
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,718
One day you're going to die,
and when you end up in hell. . .

194
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:55,180
. . .at least it'll be a step up
from this place.

195
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,864
You haven't left for Psychlo.

196
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:58,202
Your powers of observation
are simply startling.

197
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:00,287
Give me three pans to go.

198
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,375
I don't know what
you're so down about.

199
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,045
You still get to be head of security.

200
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:13,217
Which, from what I can tell,
is a pretty cushy job.

201
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,220
Well, I can assure you. . .

202
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:21,391
. . .that I was not groomed since birth
to have some cushy job. . .

203
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,520
. . .that even a moron like you
could perform.

204
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:28,857
While you were still learning
how to spell your name. . .

205
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,861
. . .I was being trained
to conquer galaxies!

206
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:36,281
To do anything less. . .

207
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,618
. . .is a disgrace
to my entire family line.

208
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,663
That'll be six credits.

209
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,331
Put it on my tab.

210
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,624
You don't have a tab.

211
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,459
I do now.

212
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,669
You're new here,
so I'll explain how it works.

213
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,046
I eat first.

214
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,715
Then my men eat.

215
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:38,010
If there's anything left,
you can share it with them.

216
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,345
That's how it used to work.

217
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,515
Greener, let's just stay alive.

218
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:44,766
You're right.

219
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,393
-So I'll fight you.
-No.

220
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,230
Without food,
we don't have strength to escape.

221
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,983
-So now we're escaping?
-I am.

222
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:54,193
Come if you want.

223
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,491
We fight, it's to the death.

224
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:24,848
Say your prayers to the gods!

225
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,589
We have enough problems without
killing each other over food.

226
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:03,929
From now on, we eat at the same time.

227
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:40,841
Sir.

228
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:47,681
I was wondering when
you'd look at that.

229
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:52,811
It came in last week,
and I put it right in your box.

230
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,734
I've wasted my time, haven't l?

231
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:04,656
If you're going to lie to me, have
the decency to do a credible job. . .

232
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,534
. . .so I don't look like an idiot
for training you.

233
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:11,914
But I'm not lying. I put the photo
in your box as soon as it came in.

234
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:15,459
You are pathetic. You wouldn't last
one day at the academy.

235
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,879
-And I saw you.
-What?

236
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:23,967
You said:

237
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:27,721
"We use picto-cameras
to spy on other offices.

238
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,017
But under no circumstance
do we spy on our own office. "

239
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,478
That's right. We don't. I do.

240
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:36,897
Start talking.

241
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:40,692
The photo's from
last week's recon drone.

242
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:44,196
It shows a rockslide in the mountains.
It exposed a gold vein.

243
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,448
You were waiting for me to transfer. . .

244
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,826
. . .so you could turn it in
and get credit.

245
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:50,369
I didn't think you'd mind.

246
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:53,580
I don't mind. Turn it in. But before
you do, pretend you're not. . .

247
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:56,500
. . .a complete imbecile. . .

248
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,335
. . .and check the compo gradients.

249
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,591
It's full of uranium. No Psychlo. . .

250
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,721
. . .can get there without his breath gas
exploding. No way to mine the gold.

251
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:17,604
But what I do mind is that you
betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!

252
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,691
It's worthless! You said so!

253
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,360
But you didn't know it was worthless!

254
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:31,702
I would never hurt you, sir.

255
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:39,251
I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me.
It's against regulations, sir.

256
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:43,630
I can make this up to you, sir.
I promise. I swear.

257
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,965
Please, sir.

258
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,387
You do not have to shoot me, sir.

259
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:03,734
Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?

260
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:06,403
Of course not.
We have work to do. Come.

261
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:12,242
Tomorrow morning, we must warn
the Planetship of the mutiny.

262
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,452
What mutiny?

263
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,497
The one you're going to pretend
is in the works. . .

264
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:20,959
. . .Iike your life depended on it.
Because it does.

265
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:25,756
If the worker revolt takes place,
my informants tell me. . .

266
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:29,301
. . .that the first order of business is
to separate you from your head.

267
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:34,181
Which is why there will be no revolt.

268
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:38,310
I am authorizing you to use whatever
means necessary to prevent it.

269
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:43,190
The best way is to increase profits
and stop cutting the workers' pay.

270
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,567
Production equals profits.

271
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,530
And I've already ordered
as many new workers as possible. . .

272
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,281
. . .to boost production.

273
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,159
But we have to pay the new workers.

274
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:59,289
Maybe you were absent the day they
taught economics at the academy, Ker.

275
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,042
But nobody works for free.

276
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,211
Man-animals do.

277
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:08,799
What if we were to train them
how to mine?

278
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:16,932
Man-animals operating machinery?

279
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,227
Have you blown a head gasket?

280
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:25,440
I will be the laughingstock
of the universe.

281
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,901
So you should have me
take man-animals. . .

282
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,362
. . .with equipment,
out to a remote area. . .

283
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:33,699
. . .better that you don't know where,
and try and train them.

284
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,827
Have them do some test mining.

285
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,663
If it doesn't work out,
no one will know.

286
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:41,957
-Right.
-And if it does work. . .

287
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,334
. . .I will be vaporized.

288
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,295
It is against the law.

289
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:47,713
Regulations say. . .

290
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:52,134
. . .a Planetship faced with
a profit-threatening situation. . .

291
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:55,637
. . .is relieved
of all other ordinances. . .

292
00:34:55,846 --> 00:35:00,225
. . .to pursue, to protect
and to acquire said profits.

293
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,560
There you have it.

294
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,778
We stick to the original plan.

295
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,114
Bring in new workers. . .

296
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:18,160
. . .and they go on half-pay
as soon as they arrive.

297
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:21,246
And that is final!

298
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:27,271
Run! Run!

299
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,495
Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.

300
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:32,044
Last time we didn't even stop timing
until its lungs burst.

301
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:33,295
That's the wager.

302
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:43,680
No way this man-animal
lasts more than four minutes.

303
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:08,080
Help me!

304
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:09,998
I need your air!

305
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:28,183
The wager's off.
The damn thing cheated.

306
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,777
The Planetship is hiding something.

307
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,363
All we have to do
is find out what it is. . .

308
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,490
. . .then we'll have leverage.

309
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,993
And then we can get the gold.

310
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,370
What do you mean, we? It's my plan.

311
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:52,916
I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then
I'm getting off this stinking planet.

312
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,376
Come on, sir.

313
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,712
You gotta let me in on it.

314
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,506
I barely make any lousy credits
in this job.

315
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:02,926
And I've got five wives
to support, sir.

316
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,682
I don't know if I want
to partner up with an idiot.

317
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,852
How do I even know
you understand the plan?

318
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:21,153
We train man-animals
who don't need breath gas. . .

319
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:23,530
. . .to mine the gold for us.

320
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,117
But Home Planet owns this planet.
The gold belongs to them.

321
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,744
That's the beauty of it.

322
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,246
Home Planet doesn't know
the gold exists.

323
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:34,333
Those corporate crapheads
won't know we stole it.

324
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,585
It's the perfect crime, sir.

325
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:40,964
Putting aside the serious violations
of teaching mining to inferiors. . .

326
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:45,093
. . .and insulting corporate superiors,
each one punishable by death.

327
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,221
So it is my duty to report you. . .

328
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:51,266
. . .though you'll be vaporized, and
I'll have to train a new assistant.

329
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,520
But it's your stinking plan, sir.

330
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:56,939
So I'm glad I have
a recording of you. . .

331
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,274
. . .Iaying out the plan
and my reprimanding you.

332
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,527
Think of it as part of your education.

333
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,488
Education, huh?

334
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:11,537
Never engage in a criminal activity
unless you have a patsy to pin it on. . .

335
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:13,831
. . .in case you ever get found out.

336
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,750
Thank you. That's great.

337
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,961
But why do I have to be the patsy?

338
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,713
So you don't get any bright ideas
to get rid of Terl. . .

339
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,007
. . .and keep the gold for yourself.

340
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:25,926
But I'd never double-cross you.

341
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:29,888
I've arranged that if any unfortunate
accident were to befall me. . .

342
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,433
. . .this would go
straight to the Home Office.

343
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:54,890
Double or nothing
I can blow off one of its limbs.

344
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:05,234
That one does seem to be unusually
intelligent and resourceful.

345
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,694
But it's also defiant.

346
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,780
We'll need leverage over it.

347
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:12,199
Leverage? Over a man-animal?

348
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,368
Man is a primitive species. . .

349
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:19,289
. . .so we'll need something primitive
for leverage. Like food.

350
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,459
What do you think a man-animal
would like to eat?

351
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:24,628
What would he consider a treat?

352
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:26,755
How the crap should I know?

353
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:29,132
There's no way of knowing that.

354
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,886
But before we educate it
on the machine. . .

355
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:36,431
. . .we'll take it to the mountains
with a couple of the others.

356
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,642
Let them think they've escaped. . .

357
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:42,521
. . .and then we'll sit back
and watch it choose its favorite food.

358
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:44,565
Yes.

359
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:05,502
Look!

360
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:17,598
Three days, and they still haven't
eaten anything yet.

361
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:20,350
Precisely. Now that
the man-animals feel. . .

362
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,686
. . .that they have
enough distance from us. . .

363
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:26,023
. . .soon they'll find
their favorite food and celebrate.

364
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,578
What is it?

365
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,246
Food. Food!

366
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:52,049
No spark, no flints, nothing.
You, Floyd?

367
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,676
Plenty to burn.
Nothing to start a fire with.

368
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,893
-That's their favorite.
-Of course it is.

369
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:06,230
-They could've selected anything.
-It's not cooked.

370
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:11,443
If man-animal prefers rat uncooked,
then our job is that much easier.

371
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:15,072
If they like their rat so much,
how come those two aren't eating?

372
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,743
Don't you know anything? The leader
of the pack always eats first. See?

373
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,753
We're really going to have
leverage over them now.

374
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:45,769
What are you doing?

375
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:57,906
They know about the camera.

376
00:44:58,115 --> 00:44:59,908
Don't be a knot-head.
It's a man-animal.

377
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,411
It couldn't possibly know about it.

378
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,503
You sure called that one, sir.

379
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:13,505
No way they know about the cameras.

380
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:16,466
Move your fat ass
and let's go round them up!

381
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:18,886
Crap, lousy ceiling!

382
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:47,289
Great. This is great.

383
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,343
What do we do now?

384
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:02,513
What are you thinking, Jonnie?
Don't even think about it.

385
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:06,433
You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie.
You wouldn't live the jump!

386
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:09,144
You can surrender and rot
in those cages.

387
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:11,438
That's your choice.
I'm not going back!

388
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,483
The monsters catch us,
they'll take us to the mines.

389
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:26,495
Run!

390
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:02,948
How do we know what he wants?

391
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:06,368
They made me do this before.
Follow me and you'll be fine.

392
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:19,089
Don't touch anything.

393
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:21,675
Get them mad,
think what they'll do to us.

394
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:52,122
Excuse me, but I am your instructor. . .

395
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:53,665
. . .if you'll forgive such arrogance. . .

396
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:57,252
. . .for I do not have the honor
to be a Psychlo.

397
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:58,921
I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.

398
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:06,345
As you are listening to me,
I most likely do not exist. . .

399
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:10,641
. . .as we may have been exterminated
like many other races. . .

400
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:13,810
. . .by the gas drones
of our conquerors.

401
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:16,271
Please forgive my pretension. . .

402
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:19,733
. . .as I try to educate you
in Psychlo. . .

403
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:23,278
. . .the noble language
of our superiors.

404
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:06,405
You understand?

405
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:10,367
You understand me?

406
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:14,580
Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?

407
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,669
Obviously, this is going
to take a while.

408
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:43,775
Jonnie! Jonnie!

409
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,822
Carlo! Carlo!

410
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:52,951
I know who they are and where they're
from. I can speak their language.

411
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:55,078
-Monsters?
-They're called Psychlos.

412
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,622
What did they do to him?

413
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:59,500
They made him look into a light,
a god machine.

414
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,960
It teaches.
It's a knowledge machine.

415
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:06,089
It sends pictures through your head
so fast, it's spinning.

416
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:08,050
Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.

417
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:12,638
No, I can't. I have to stay.
I have to learn more about them.

418
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,642
This may be our only way out of here.

419
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:36,036
So this is the monster's language?

420
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,163
No, no. This is mathematics.

421
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:43,085
This is the unifying language
of the entire universe.

422
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,008
Look.

423
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:52,970
This symbol is called a triangle.

424
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:55,848
If all these sides are equal. . .

425
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:58,600
. . .then these three angles
must also be equal.

426
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,853
Equal to what?

427
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:02,646
To each other.

428
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:06,024
It's the basic foundation
of Euclidean geometry.

429
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,861
Seems pretty hard to understand.

430
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:12,698
No, only at first. And then it
becomes clear in your mind.

431
00:51:12,948 --> 00:51:14,950
I learned molecular biology.

432
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,413
This is the symbol for water
and engineering.

433
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:24,585
See, a wing, see? And line
and form and artistic composition.

434
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:27,629
You see, this is a square,
like a cage.

435
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,176
I thought we were supposed to be
working on stuff to help us escape.

436
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:35,888
This will.

437
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:38,223
All this will.

438
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:56,074
Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.

439
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:02,706
"The security chief should secure
the field vault. . .

440
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:05,959
. . .with an eight-digit
combination code. . .

441
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:10,380
. . .and do not use a personal
or employee. . .

442
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:11,965
. . .identification number. "

443
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,218
What's an identification number?

444
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:15,636
There.

445
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:17,763
-How many numbers is that?
-Eight.

446
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,097
Eight?

447
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:21,183
Eight.

448
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,235
It's more clever than that.

449
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:33,111
The question is, how clever?

450
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,447
Try the numbers backwards.

451
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:51,463
Look at this.

452
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:53,465
It's a recording machine.

453
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:02,766
This is how he watches us.

454
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:33,964
Stop! Chrissy, stop!

455
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,966
What if he's not dead?

456
00:53:36,175 --> 00:53:38,969
Hope is an admirable quality,
but foolish isn't.

457
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:42,055
I can't give you permission
to go and get killed.

458
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:43,974
I don't need your permission.

459
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:48,604
I'm no longer a child.

460
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:06,205
Do you want lunch?

461
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,717
It's obviously too much
to ask a man-animal. . .

462
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,261
. . .to learn a language
as sophisticated as Psychlo.

463
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:24,723
What if it can understand
and it's pretending it can't?

464
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,059
-What the hell for?
-I don't know.

465
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:30,771
Maybe it's secretly listening,
trying to get leverage over on us.

466
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:34,817
Man-animal getting leverage over
a Psychlo. That'll be the day.

467
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:39,404
What if this one is
particularly stupid?

468
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:41,365
Maybe we should train another one.

469
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:43,867
No time. When they detect the gold. . .

470
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:46,620
. . .the Planetship will know
what we're doing.

471
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:53,377
We'll have to terminate the operation
and cover our tracks.

472
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:05,013
It speaks Psychlo.

473
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:06,890
Go on, say something else.

474
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:09,226
You'll stay here as my prisoner. . .

475
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:12,229
. . .while you, you go
and get a transporter.

476
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:15,899
Because you've learned Psychlo
doesn't mean you are one.

477
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:18,277
Follow my orders
or I'll have you killed.

478
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:23,657
How exactly do you plan to do that?

479
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:36,253
-Mickey, no!
-Mickey, no!

480
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:42,050
If any of you rat-brains
knew anything about firearms. . .

481
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:46,305
. . .you would know that you never
store loaded weapons.

482
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:47,890
You drop him now!

483
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:50,767
Drop him or I won't mine
an ounce of your gold.

484
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:55,063
I'll have you vaporized
and find someone else to mine it.

485
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:56,356
You don't have time.

486
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:59,109
You can't hide this
from Home Office forever.

487
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:05,115
A man getting leverage over a Psychlo.
That'll be the day.

488
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:16,043
I think it's time that we show
our little friend a thing or two.

489
00:56:42,861 --> 00:56:45,155
As long as you cling to
the feeble hope. . .

490
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:47,282
. . .that you'll ever get
the better of me. . .

491
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:50,410
. . .you'll be distracted
from more important things.

492
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,538
Which is exactly why. . .

493
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:55,040
. . .I share the following with you:

494
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,377
When we attacked your planet. . .

495
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:03,215
. . .all your soldiers and all
their advanced technology. . .

496
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,759
. . .could only put up
a nine-minute fight. . .

497
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:07,970
. . .before they were exterminated.

498
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:12,683
Which is why man
is an endangered species.

499
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:17,062
Everything you humans knew is here.

500
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:19,356
You can look at anything you want. . .

501
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:23,068
. . .because there is nothing
that will help you.

502
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,853
Satisfied?

503
00:57:58,395 --> 00:57:59,521
Yes.

504
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:03,400
I have one more demonstration
for you and your friends.

505
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:17,581
You will be relocated
to a new mining site.

506
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:20,751
If any of you get any bright ideas
about escaping. . .

507
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:25,172
. . .keep in mind that although you
know nothing about firearms, I do.

508
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:30,469
I graduated top marksman in my class.
I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.

509
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,137
Tell them what I said.

510
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:34,139
We try to run, he'll kill us.

511
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,059
-That's it?
-Yes.

512
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,520
Allow me to demonstrate.

513
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:58,413
No! Wait!

514
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:18,058
Let's give this demon
what it deserves.

515
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:20,561
Kill it, I say! Destroy it!

516
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:22,813
Shoot! Shoot!

517
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:24,064
Why wait? Kill it!

518
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:25,774
Kill it. Then we'll run.

519
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:27,276
Then what?

520
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:31,238
What kind of life is it to run?
Living in fear of being hunted?

521
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:34,158
What about those we're leaving behind?

522
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:36,160
There's nothing we can do.

523
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:37,953
Only the gods can free them.

524
00:59:38,162 --> 00:59:41,665
You think the lights in the sky
are gods waiting to save us?

525
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:46,420
Do you? Those are planets,
planets like this one.

526
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:48,630
The great villages were built by us.

527
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:51,300
By men and women just like us.

528
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:54,261
Willing to fight to the death
for one thing:

529
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:56,013
Their freedom!

530
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:58,724
Do you think no one has tried?

531
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,685
You can't defeat them.

532
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:09,151
That is our fate.

533
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:13,322
Yes, we can. Yes, we can!

534
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:15,449
But we have to go back.

535
01:00:15,657 --> 01:00:17,951
We go back and learn
about their weapons.

536
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:21,663
Our race is slowly dying
and will be gone forever.

537
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:25,667
Let it be said that we took
this one chance and fought!

538
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:28,504
Are you with me? Are you with me?!

539
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:30,714
We fight!

540
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:35,344
If you're fighting the beast,
me and my men are with you.

541
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:38,597
Thank you.
It's good to have friends out here.

542
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:40,766
May the gods be with you.

543
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,650
One as wise as you has ways
to stop me from shooting.

544
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:52,903
I know if I'd tried,
you would've killed me first.

545
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:03,705
Damn right, rat-brain! That's the
first intelligent thing you've said.

546
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,042
Rest break is over.

547
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:11,296
There's something I need you to see
so you're properly motivated.

548
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:34,027
You don't know her?

549
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:37,990
No, I don't know her.

550
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:42,161
She's one of the foulest
looking females I've ever seen.

551
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,246
While I tend to agree. . .

552
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:49,418
. . .it's obvious that you show a lack
of aptitude for strategic deception.

553
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:54,173
On the other hand, what you show
marginal proficiency at is. . .

554
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,508
. . .drawing.

555
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:00,804
This was found when she was collected.

556
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:06,143
The collar has enough explosives
to remove her head from her body.

557
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,061
And this remote. . .

558
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,231
. . .will activate it
from anywhere on the planet.

559
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,651
So if you disobey me, let me
show you what will happen.

560
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,528
Please don't harm her.

561
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:18,739
I believe you.

562
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:21,325
Don't worry, rat-brain.

563
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:24,369
Every collar has its own frequency.

564
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:27,414
I'm not going to blow up
your little female friend.

565
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:30,918
Just. . .

566
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,129
. . .this one.

567
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:37,257
You made your point.

568
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:39,510
I said I would mine your gold.

569
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:41,970
Please don't kill him. Please.

570
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:47,226
Fine.

571
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:52,231
Due to our new working relationship,
I will grant you this one request.

572
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:55,275
I won't kill him.

573
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:58,570
But you may never ask of me
anything again.

574
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:00,280
I promise.

575
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,995
As I've said, I won't kill him.

576
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:08,247
Yes, sir.

577
01:03:26,223 --> 01:03:27,891
Stupid humans.

578
01:03:55,544 --> 01:03:57,337
No, no, no.

579
01:03:57,546 --> 01:03:59,464
What you did was right.

580
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,550
It was right for all of us.

581
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,553
Greener, you're a thinker. . .

582
01:04:05,179 --> 01:04:07,055
. . .and the gods respect thinkers.

583
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:09,433
You didn't kill Sammy.

584
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:13,020
Jonnie, this is not living.

585
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,939
This is. . .

586
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:17,566
. . .cages!

587
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:18,942
Cages!

588
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:22,654
Even if we escaped and went back
to where we all came from. . .

589
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:24,114
. . .it'd be like you said.

590
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:27,075
We'd be waiting for the Psychlos
to hunt us down.

591
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:30,704
I think that is not living either.

592
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:37,127
We all chose to fight.

593
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:05,614
-Count us in too!
-What's going on?

594
01:05:05,823 --> 01:05:08,951
Someone knows how to speak
the Psychlo's language.

595
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:10,786
He's gonna help us fight.

596
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:08,468
Yes.

597
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:12,389
Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.

598
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,726
She's. . . .

599
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,103
His soon-to-be
newly acquired secretary.

600
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,606
-Yes.
-Really?

601
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:24,818
She's stupid enough not to be a menace,
pretty enough to be decorative.

602
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:29,281
She gets drunk with economical speed
and has other advantages.

603
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:33,785
I can see that.

604
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:36,663
-Don't you have some work to do?
-No.

605
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:37,706
Ker?

606
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:39,333
All right, sir.

607
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,587
Now, listen, missy. . .

608
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:46,924
. . .I'm still waiting for
the Planetship's accounts.

609
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:53,055
I had to go way beyond
the call of duty to get these.

610
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:56,433
I see. Well, that's why
I especially chose you.

611
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:59,186
So you'll keep your side
of the bargain?

612
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,814
Which was?

613
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:05,859
You said we'd have a huge house
when we go back to Psychlo next year.

614
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,487
-We're going to be rich, right?
-Right.

615
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:12,574
I am going to make you
as happy as a baby Psychlo. . .

616
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:15,577
. . .on a straight diet of Kerbango.

617
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:30,968
Well, isn't it interesting. . .

618
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:33,887
. . .that you have been keeping
two sets of books. . .

619
01:07:34,096 --> 01:07:36,181
. . .and telling all the workers. . .

620
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:38,851
. . .that the planet has been
operating at a loss?

621
01:07:40,561 --> 01:07:44,398
I only claimed that it was
running at a loss. . .

622
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:48,902
. . .to try and motivate them all
to work harder.

623
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:50,696
Oh, yes, of course.

624
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:53,323
And it had nothing to do
with the fact. . .

625
01:07:53,532 --> 01:07:55,951
. . .that it allowed you
to cut the workers' pay. . .

626
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:59,329
. . .and keep all the extra credit
for yourself. Did it?

627
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:03,458
That. Well, I can explain that.

628
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:08,046
Well, unfortunately, the company
requires me to vaporize you.

629
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:10,799
On the other hand. . .

630
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:14,511
. . .I could understand someone
in your situation. . .

631
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,889
. . .being old and having no future. . .

632
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:20,100
. . .coming up with ways
to solve your financial problems.

633
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,937
-You can?
-Oh, yes.

634
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:26,773
It's really of no interest
to anybody. . .

635
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:29,359
. . .to have you not be Planetship.

636
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:33,655
But it would be prudent of you
to start to share your authority.

637
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:48,003
But these forms are
all blank, undated.

638
01:08:48,629 --> 01:08:51,131
You could put anything
you wanted on them.

639
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:54,968
You would run the entire planet!

640
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,141
I would be nothing but a puppet.

641
01:09:01,809 --> 01:09:04,436
Well, if you don't want
to do it that way. . .

642
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:06,772
. . .we could always do it by. . .

643
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:09,441
. . .the book.

644
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:19,952
What the hell does the Planetship
need with all this mining equipment?

645
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,954
That's not even the crazy part.

646
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:25,707
He's ordered me to take a group
of man-animals to a remote area. . .

647
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:29,211
. . .with the equipment to see
if they can be trained to mine.

648
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:32,631
Man-animals being able to mine?

649
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,049
Yes.

650
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:43,350
Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.

651
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,144
Indeed.

652
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:47,020
But what can I do?

653
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:49,148
An order is an order.

654
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:56,155
You have a busy day, rat-brain.

655
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:57,948
First, learning how to fly. . .

656
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:01,243
. . .then on to the learning machine
for mining techniques.

657
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,149
Crash one more time. . .

658
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:35,652
. . .and your little friend
will no longer be among the living.

659
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:36,987
Again.

660
01:10:37,196 --> 01:10:38,697
Again!

661
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:23,992
Never underestimate what a little
leverage can do, rat-brain.

662
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:52,354
That's good, man-animal.

663
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,191
This is the lever where
we mine the gold!

664
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,527
Lever! Up, down!

665
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:03,365
Warning: External sensors indicate
dangerous radiation levels ahead.

666
01:12:03,574 --> 01:12:05,367
This is as far as I can go!

667
01:12:05,576 --> 01:12:06,994
Land it!

668
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:23,302
Meet me back here in 1 4 days.

669
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,679
I want the ship's cage
half-filled with gold.

670
01:12:30,767 --> 01:12:33,520
And even though I won't be
at the mining site. . .

671
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:37,065
. . .I'll be watching you.

672
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:50,537
-How's your side?
-It's good. Good.

673
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:04,927
Next time, you fly.

674
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,399
No, no, no.
Even if we do mine enough gold. . .

675
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:22,611
. . .we'll be lucky to fill
half of that cage in time.

676
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,071
That's why we're not mining.

677
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:27,825
What about the big uglies watching
us with that eye in the sky?

678
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:30,327
Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?

679
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,996
We split them in half.
One group goes. . .

680
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:34,540
. . .and one group stays. . .

681
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:37,251
. . .and it looks as if
we're still working.

682
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:43,131
But if we don't deliver it in 1 4 days
to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.

683
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:45,592
There's a place called Fort Knox
where the gold's already been mined.

684
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:48,846
Listen, there will be no mining,
but we'll deliver it.

685
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:52,808
Okay, so we have to pretend
that we're mining the gold.

686
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:57,521
We have to figure out where
we're gonna get the gold. . .

687
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:00,274
. . .then we have to get the supplies
to help our revolt.

688
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:01,942
Yeah.

689
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:04,653
We barely have men to
do one of those things. . .

690
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:06,780
. . .Iet alone all three.

691
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:11,660
It's good to have friends
on the outside!

692
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:30,596
Come on!

693
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:33,640
If you two kept your eyes open,
that'd be a great help.

694
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:36,894
Look for an ocean. If you see any,
we've gone too far.

695
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:40,856
I think this is it.

696
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:42,858
I think we're in Washington.

697
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:45,736
-We're still in Colorado.
-That's impossible.

698
01:14:45,986 --> 01:14:47,654
I've been watching,
we haven't crossed this line.

699
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,781
You're not paying attention.

700
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:53,744
Let him navigate and watch me.
You're gonna fly on the way back.

701
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:57,039
We couldn't have crossed
all these lines.

702
01:14:57,247 --> 01:15:00,834
Well, we did. The lines must
have faded over time.

703
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:19,311
This great village was the capital
for all our tribes.

704
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,022
This is where our people's
history was buried.

705
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:35,410
Here. When the Psychlos
attacked Earth. . .

706
01:15:35,702 --> 01:15:37,746
. . .they sent out flying gas drones.

707
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:41,625
Our ancestors must've made it out
into these remote radiated areas. . .

708
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:45,587
. . .and the only reason they survived
was because radiation is. . .

709
01:15:45,796 --> 01:15:47,422
. . .Iethal to the Psychlos.

710
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:50,592
-And that was not good for them.
-That's good for us.

711
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:53,720
Even if we fail, the people
will be safe if they stay--

712
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:55,722
Safe from being hunted. . .

713
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:58,725
. . .but radiation is
also poisonous for humans.

714
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:01,436
So, you see, either way. . .

715
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:04,648
. . .if we don't take back our planet. . .

716
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:08,694
. . .the last of humanity
becomes extinct.

717
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,516
Based on what I've read about
Psychlo security. . .

718
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:40,934
. . .if we revolted. . .

719
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:44,438
. . .only using weapons they don't
perceive as any real threat. . .

720
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:47,149
. . .if we just use rocks and sticks. . .

721
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:50,486
. . .they'll just throw us
back in the cages.

722
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:51,904
But. . .

723
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:56,116
. . .we're gonna stage this revolt
inside the dome.

724
01:16:56,325 --> 01:17:01,038
So the Psychlos are gonna have to
come inside the city to round us up.

725
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:04,708
And that is when we blow the dome.

726
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:07,544
Carlo's gonna blow the dome.

727
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:09,922
-They won't have masks.
-They can't breathe.

728
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,298
-They die.
-Carlo?

729
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:14,468
-I'm gonna blow the dome?
-You're gonna blow the dome.

730
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:19,181
Piece of cake.
Piece of cake, piece of cake.

731
01:17:22,893 --> 01:17:25,521
But remember, as soon as
we blow the dome. . .

732
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:27,689
. . .boom, stage 2 alarm.

733
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:28,732
What is that?

734
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:32,152
Thousands of gas drones and troops
will be teleported here.

735
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:35,864
-We can't fight against that.
-Then what's the point?

736
01:17:36,073 --> 01:17:39,409
If they send more monsters to Earth,
we get wiped out.

737
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:42,788
Well, the point is,
we don't let it get to stage 2.

738
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:45,582
We'll destroy their Home Planet
before it happens.

739
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:48,585
-Their Home Planet?
-Their Home Planet.

740
01:17:50,254 --> 01:17:53,090
We need some extra supplies
before we can do that.

741
01:17:53,298 --> 01:17:55,717
Our first stop is a radiation bomb
storage bunker.

742
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:58,303
Is everyone clear?

743
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:01,348
Count us in.

744
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:34,548
-Look.
-Flying machines.

745
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:38,010
These are flying machines.
They're weapons of some kind.

746
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:42,097
Flying spears.

747
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,683
I think there's a little more
to it than that.

748
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:03,994
It's a learning machine.

749
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,121
Teach us to fly.

750
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:26,099
You're right.

751
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,768
It's like breaking a horse.

752
01:19:28,519 --> 01:19:30,687
Can you teach your men to fly this?

753
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:33,816
-Piece of cake, piece of cake.
-Piece of cake.

754
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:35,776
-Try and keep it level.
-Jonnie!

755
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:37,236
-What is it?
-I think I found one.

756
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:40,364
Come on! Nuclear firebomb!

757
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:41,907
Piece of cake.

758
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:45,536
According to the book, there's
a firing mechanism. . .

759
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:49,206
. . .that has to be in place before
it's operational.

760
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:11,562
Don't touch the auto-sensor.

761
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,313
What happens if we do?

762
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:16,275
The bomb will explode. Big fire.

763
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,862
Look. Greeners from this cave.

764
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,738
Off. Off.

765
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:38,505
War--

766
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:39,631
--ning.

767
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,592
Warning. Warning.

768
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,010
Warning.

769
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:45,846
Warning.

770
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:47,181
Get it?

771
01:20:52,478 --> 01:20:55,063
What does the auto-sensor look like?

772
01:20:55,355 --> 01:20:57,566
There's an illustration in Appendix A.

773
01:21:03,197 --> 01:21:04,698
What? What?

774
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,870
We don't have Appendix A.

775
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:19,546
More books, Jonnie.

776
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:29,640
It's okay.

777
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:33,060
I thought you said nuclear fires
were powerful?

778
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:34,812
It's not nuclear. Mickey!

779
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,271
Sorry.

780
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,023
You're sorry. Mickey!

781
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:41,318
Stop touching things
and turn off the damn light.

782
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:42,528
Leave it on.

783
01:21:44,363 --> 01:21:45,614
Look.

784
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:53,288
Good work, Mickey.

785
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:55,499
You just found Appendix A.

786
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:13,851
Will this be enough to blow up
their whole planet?

787
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:16,436
Radiation reacts with their
planet's atmosphere.

788
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:19,648
-There's enough to destroy it forever.
-Let me do it.

789
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:24,153
Let me go there
and detonate the weapon.

790
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:27,739
It's brave of you, Mickey,
but it's my plan, so I go.

791
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:31,034
You're the only one who speaks
the monsters' language.

792
01:22:31,243 --> 01:22:33,245
You know things about them!

793
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:35,664
Listen. . .

794
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:38,584
. . .without you leading this revolt. . .

795
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:41,461
. . .we might not succeed.

796
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:36,850
I hope their eye in the sky didn't
see the gold through the lead walls.

797
01:23:55,702 --> 01:23:57,913
Start filling the cage.

798
01:23:58,121 --> 01:24:01,959
We'll hide half and deliver
the other half to Terl tonight.

799
01:24:21,854 --> 01:24:23,397
Why is it in bars?

800
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:26,942
I assumed, sir. . .

801
01:24:27,151 --> 01:24:31,155
. . .that a Psychlo of your refinement
wouldn't want raw ore.

802
01:24:35,242 --> 01:24:36,577
Really?

803
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:50,257
Since you have had extra time. . .

804
01:24:50,466 --> 01:24:52,551
. . .to smelt it into bricks. . .

805
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:55,429
. . .I'll expect the rest of the gold
in seven days.

806
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:27,628
He has no intention of sharing
that gold with you.

807
01:25:29,796 --> 01:25:32,424
What the hell are you talking about?

808
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:36,512
Why are you here?
You should be mining the gold!

809
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,681
You really think the only reason
he made that recording. . .

810
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:42,976
. . .was to have you as his patsy?
Do you, Ker?

811
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:46,647
No. He has leverage over you. . .

812
01:25:46,855 --> 01:25:49,483
. . .and it'll guarantee you
never see an ounce.

813
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:53,278
How do you know
about those recordings?

814
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:55,364
It really is amazing. . .

815
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:58,450
. . .the collection of discs
you find in Terl's personal vault.

816
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:15,092
First, we trade.

817
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,927
-The disc--
-I don't think so!

818
01:26:17,177 --> 01:26:19,555
Because if you don't give me
the disc now. . .

819
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:21,473
. . .I will blow your head off.

820
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:43,787
You want to trade?

821
01:26:45,122 --> 01:26:46,290
Let's trade.

822
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,834
Hooray!

823
01:26:51,128 --> 01:26:53,505
Won't the Psychlo see
I'm not wearing the collar?

824
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:56,842
After tonight, won't matter
much either way.

825
01:26:58,177 --> 01:27:00,888
Jonnie, I know you
don't believe in fate. . .

826
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:03,432
. . .but I've always known
this was your destiny.

827
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:06,810
This is our destiny.
It's freedom for all of us.

828
01:27:07,352 --> 01:27:08,854
For our children.

829
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:11,565
Children?

830
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:37,007
Beautiful.

831
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:51,230
Quickly!

832
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:11,333
What if this one is
particularly stupid?

833
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:14,044
There's no time.
When they detect the gold...

834
01:28:14,253 --> 01:28:16,839
... the Planetship will know
what we're doing.

835
01:28:21,385 --> 01:28:24,680
We'll have to terminate the operation
and cover our tracks.

836
01:28:26,515 --> 01:28:30,477
When they detect the gold, the
Planetship will know what we're doing.

837
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:35,357
We'll have to terminate the operation
and cover our tracks.

838
01:28:35,566 --> 01:28:36,441
I've been thinking.

839
01:28:36,984 --> 01:28:40,821
80/20 is a pretty fair
distribution of the gold.

840
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:43,282
But I should get the 80% .

841
01:28:44,074 --> 01:28:47,494
And with my share, I'm gonna
fire all my wives. . .

842
01:28:47,744 --> 01:28:49,204
. . .and buy new ones.

843
01:28:50,247 --> 01:28:52,457
Maybe pretty ones this time.

844
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:54,793
Ker-bango!

845
01:28:57,087 --> 01:28:58,255
Congratulations.

846
01:28:58,547 --> 01:29:01,633
You've learned how to get
leverage over someone, haven't you?

847
01:29:02,426 --> 01:29:05,471
Which means I haven't wasted my time
training you, have l?

848
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:08,182
-You're not upset?
-Don't be crazy.

849
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:10,559
You know how long I've waited
for this day?

850
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:12,936
I know the perfect way to celebrate.

851
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,274
What are you doing?

852
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:19,818
You can't shoot me.

853
01:29:20,027 --> 01:29:23,113
I made a copy and gave it
to someone for safekeeping.

854
01:29:23,322 --> 01:29:26,450
You are just too good of a teacher.

855
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:31,455
How about giving your old teacher
a clue as to who this might be?

856
01:29:31,663 --> 01:29:33,749
You insult yourself, sir.

857
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:35,334
You taught me better.

858
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:37,753
How am I supposed to know who it is?

859
01:29:37,961 --> 01:29:39,505
I don't know.

860
01:29:39,713 --> 01:29:42,341
It could be anybody
on this damn planet.

861
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:44,593
-It could be a mechanic.
-No.

862
01:29:44,843 --> 01:29:46,970
-It could be a concubine.
-No, no.

863
01:29:47,179 --> 01:29:49,598
It could be anybody
in communications.

864
01:29:49,807 --> 01:29:50,682
Wrong!

865
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:54,812
I hate these things. It's like
it's a test I'm not prepared for.

866
01:29:56,271 --> 01:30:00,984
Well, hell, it could even be
our friendly bartender!

867
01:30:06,657 --> 01:30:08,867
Please. I made a mistake.

868
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:16,041
Now, give me the original disc. . .

869
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:19,628
. . .then meet me at the teleportation
platform in two hours.

870
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:22,256
Sir.

871
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,309
The control bunker's to the right.

872
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:35,686
Three guards left.

873
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:38,897
Two from the guardhouse,
one coming from the north.

874
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:41,275
I'll take the guardhouse.

875
01:31:45,464 --> 01:31:48,258
Jonnie, the shooting's
triggered the alarm.

876
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:52,471
Five guards from the south,
heavily armed and moving fast.

877
01:31:52,763 --> 01:31:54,181
Between you and the bunker.

878
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:55,891
Jonnie!

879
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:05,210
The man-animals have escaped.
They're running into the city.

880
01:33:05,502 --> 01:33:08,547
Send some guards out
and round them up. I'm busy.

881
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:11,175
Don't bother me
with every little detail.

882
01:33:11,383 --> 01:33:12,843
Gotta round them up.

883
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,564
Psychlos!

884
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:28,275
Psychlos!

885
01:33:30,194 --> 01:33:32,154
7-7-3.

886
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:37,284
Greener? Carlo. Explosives are set.
Can I blow the dome?

887
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:40,412
Greener?

888
01:33:40,954 --> 01:33:42,956
What's going on? Talk to me!

889
01:33:43,165 --> 01:33:45,751
It's Carlo. What's going on?
Talk to me.

890
01:33:45,959 --> 01:33:47,211
Hold on!

891
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:50,923
If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo,
they'll send drones.

892
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:54,468
Well, hurry up. Just hurry up,
because I've got company.

893
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:41,385
Here they are.

894
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:11,915
Panther!

895
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:36,064
Hang on. I'm right on his tail.

896
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:28,367
You know what you gotta do.

897
01:38:56,770 --> 01:38:57,980
Greener, come on.

898
01:38:58,188 --> 01:38:59,773
I've gotta blow this dome now!

899
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:02,317
I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb.
Hang on.

900
01:39:02,609 --> 01:39:03,902
I'm seconds away.

901
01:39:16,915 --> 01:39:17,958
Jonnie, come on.

902
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:20,002
They're destroying the bombs.

903
01:39:20,294 --> 01:39:21,753
-It's now or never.
-Now!

904
01:39:21,962 --> 01:39:24,631
Now, go ahead! Blow the dome!
Go! Go! Go!

905
01:39:31,305 --> 01:39:34,099
Teleportation sequence terminated.

906
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:36,727
Interrupting something?

907
01:39:37,311 --> 01:39:38,770
Jonnie? Jonnie?

908
01:40:11,929 --> 01:40:14,139
Why isn't it coming down?

909
01:40:15,349 --> 01:40:17,476
The dome is holding!

910
01:40:18,727 --> 01:40:20,896
-It's not working.
-It's only cracked!

911
01:40:25,734 --> 01:40:28,529
The dome isn 't broken.
We can 't hold out long.

912
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:34,743
Attention! This is Terl,
your chief of security.

913
01:40:35,494 --> 01:40:38,705
Exterminate all man-animals at will.

914
01:40:38,914 --> 01:40:40,415
And happy hunting!

915
01:40:54,388 --> 01:40:56,348
Run! Run!

916
01:41:25,836 --> 01:41:27,129
What's with the dome?

917
01:41:28,338 --> 01:41:30,841
Hold on, I'm taking it out now.

918
01:42:12,633 --> 01:42:14,051
Help us!

919
01:42:14,426 --> 01:42:15,552
They're killing us!

920
01:42:23,519 --> 01:42:26,897
We're not gonna make it!
I think we should pull out!

921
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:51,130
I'm blowing the dome. In five.

922
01:42:51,755 --> 01:42:52,881
Four.

923
01:42:59,304 --> 01:43:00,472
Three.

924
01:43:01,348 --> 01:43:02,432
Two.

925
01:43:03,016 --> 01:43:03,892
One.

926
01:43:06,061 --> 01:43:07,604
Piece of cake.

927
01:43:36,133 --> 01:43:38,427
Everyone on the ground now! Go!

928
01:45:03,762 --> 01:45:06,431
Teleportation sequence activated.

929
01:45:08,392 --> 01:45:11,145
Teleportation sequence activated.

930
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:14,690
Psychlo War Center,
this is a stage 3 alert!

931
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:17,025
I repeat, a stage 3 alert.

932
01:45:17,234 --> 01:45:20,154
Initiate the gas drone
extermination sequence.

933
01:45:34,751 --> 01:45:37,171
You have been
quite a challenge, rat-brain.

934
01:45:37,379 --> 01:45:39,590
You'll make a hell
of a conversation piece. . .

935
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,093
. . .when you're stuffed
and hanging on the academy wall.

936
01:46:30,557 --> 01:46:32,267
Where's the rest of my gold?

937
01:46:32,684 --> 01:46:34,978
I'll exchange it for my woman's life.

938
01:46:35,646 --> 01:46:38,899
My life is over, but hers is
of no consequence to you.

939
01:46:39,983 --> 01:46:43,320
Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain.
Now, where is it?

940
01:46:43,529 --> 01:46:45,823
Trust me, you don't want to do that.

941
01:46:46,073 --> 01:46:48,450
Trust me, there's nothing I want more.

942
01:48:30,427 --> 01:48:32,221
Carlo came through.

943
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:34,825
Why don't you vaporize me?

944
01:49:42,749 --> 01:49:43,709
Leverage.

945
01:49:47,629 --> 01:49:50,424
If there are other Psychlo
colonies out there. . .

946
01:49:50,632 --> 01:49:53,510
. . .they'll send out gas drones
and exterminate us.

947
01:49:54,261 --> 01:49:57,264
But if they learn
that it was your greed. . .

948
01:49:58,056 --> 01:50:00,184
. . .that destroyed their Home Planet. . .

949
01:50:02,603 --> 01:50:05,063
. . .then all the credits
in the universe. . .

950
01:50:05,814 --> 01:50:08,317
. . .won't equal the bounty
on your head.

951
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:25,417
But there is one thing you rat-brains
weren't smart enough to realize.

952
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:27,085
Kill them.

953
01:50:41,141 --> 01:50:43,101
I fixed the problem with it.

954
01:50:44,394 --> 01:50:46,021
-It works now.
-You imbecile!

955
01:50:46,438 --> 01:50:48,524
What kind of game are you playing?

956
01:50:48,982 --> 01:50:53,487
Since I'm teaching them our technology,
they made me the head Psychlo.

957
01:50:58,408 --> 01:50:59,701
Look at the bright side.

958
01:51:00,869 --> 01:51:05,249
You may not be wallowing
in luxury on Psychlo. . .

959
01:51:07,459 --> 01:51:10,170
. . .but at least you finally
got your gold.
