00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:24,849
Julian.
You came all the way out here?

3
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,809
I had to leave somebody at the beach.

4
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,849
- It's been weeks.
- Hi.

5
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:31,369
Hello, girls.

6
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,130
You didn't fly to Rio
for the weekend?

7
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:39,249
Don't mind them.
They're just jealous.

8
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:42,209
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

9
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,769
Yeah, I got the message. Number?

10
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,609
Tonight. It's a woman
from Charlottesville.

11
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:51,009
She's flying in for negotiation
on her husband's estate.

12
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,129
- First time?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,249
She's meeting lawyers in the morning.
They want a chauffeur.

14
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:04,449
- Is she into drugs?
- No, no drugs.

15
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:07,849
1,000, right?

16
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,570
600 for me.

17
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:15,449
- Don't start this again.
- You want 50/50, get Mike,

18
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,970
or one of those drop-outs
you like so much.

19
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:22,369
There's no percentage in it
if I don't get 50/50.

20
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,929
You already cut me out of repeaters.

21
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,409
It's only fair. Only fair.

22
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:31,169
It ain't fair, Julie,
but I don't have any choice.

23
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:35,049
You got a lot of choice. You can
keep dealing retarded faggots...

24
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:37,089
Look who's talking!

25
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,409
All right... 50/50.

26
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,889
Who ' d you drop off up the beach?

27
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,569
- Wouldn't you like to know.
- Why do you do this to me?

28
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:58,129
You know anybody else
who gets in the LA Country Club?

29
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:02,009
And that's not the Hillcrest
or the Riverside or the Riviera.

30
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:05,050
I gotta run.
Leave the info on the service.

31
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,769
You don't want to take some sun?

32
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,929
I'm sure the girls
would like some company.

33
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:16,649
No, thanks. No way. See you later.

34
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,689
How's the Swedish coming?

35
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,289
OK.

36
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,250
Do you want me to help you?

37
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:06,729
Listen to the recording
and repeat what you hear.

38
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:10,409
Listen and then repeat.

39
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:13,249
I am not interested in that.

40
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:23,169
I am not interested in that.

41
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:31,329
How much farther have we to go?

42
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:37,329
How much farther have we to go?

43
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:46,409
Is this your first visit?

44
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,529
Yeah?

45
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:01,729
OK, let him through.

46
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,769
Hey, Leon, what's up?

47
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,409
Julie, I hate to bug you,
but you gotta help me.

48
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:10,729
I had this Palm Springs gig
set up for Joey

49
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,569
and he ain't nowhere around.

50
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:17,649
I can't do it. I'm getting a haircut
I got something on this afternoon.

51
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,769
Baby, this is a two-hour gig.

52
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,650
Plus the drive.

53
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:26,009
5C, straight in-and-out job.
Nothing fancy. Do me a favour.

54
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:29,569
I don't know. Maybe.
If I get some time.

55
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,409
I'll give you 50 bucks.

56
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:34,329
Go fuck yourself.
You think I'm a charity?

57
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:37,249
Wait a minute.
Who's doing who a favour?

58
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:40,009
Who called who up, begging for a sub?

59
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,449
OK. I'm sorry. I appreciate it.

60
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,489
Anything for a friend.

61
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:56,890
Ex cuse me.

62
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,569
Mind if I take my cap off, ma'am?

63
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,409
No, of course not.

64
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,609
Thank you.

65
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:22,889
I think I know this hotel
better than my own apartment.

66
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,049
All the important people
come and stay here.

67
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,569
You know,
I used to be a pool boy here.

68
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:33,969
Anything I can do to help you?

69
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,169
I'll open the champagne for you.

70
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,209
- Open up the...?
- Julian. My name is Julian.

71
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,649
You don't have to open the champagne.

72
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,449
I will give you a tip, don't worry.

73
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,730
Jesus.

74
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,209
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tolbin.
That's not what I meant. I was...

75
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:58,809
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:03,809
Is this your first time in LA?

77
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,489
- Maybe you can be a help to me.
- Yeah?

78
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:12,129
Well, I haven't been here for years,

79
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:15,849
and I was wondering if there are
any new good restaurants.

80
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,889
You know, where the famous people go?

81
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:21,409
Yeah, well...

82
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:25,289
it's probably safer to recommend
the more established restaurants.

83
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:31,529
There's... Ma Maison and La Scala...

84
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,489
Scandia.

85
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:39,809
And of the newer ones,
I hear that Le Dome is quite nice.

86
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,449
Very popular.

87
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:48,609
My, you are making me
thirsty just standing there.

88
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,249
Now you can open the champagne.

89
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,849
Pour me a drink...

90
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,889
and set the bottle down.

91
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,329
Yeah, she liked the pool boy bit.

92
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:17,569
I'm going to see her
again tomorrow afternoon.

93
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,209
Yeah.

94
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:21,249
OK, Anne. Love you, too.

95
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,889
Paging Mrs. Anderson.

96
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,129
Hey, pretty lady.

97
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:38,450
- Hi.
- Got my other jacket?

98
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,369
- Sure. Here you go, Julian.
- Thanks.

99
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,769
- Good evening, Mr. Kay.
- How you doing?

100
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,409
Fine.

101
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,729
Then he has the nerve
to hit on my sister.

102
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,769
No, he's not.

103
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,489
I told you. He's looking right at us.

104
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:21,169
What'll it be?

105
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,689
No, that's OK, Jimmy.

106
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,689
Mr. Kay would like another drink.

107
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,209
- Dry Manhattan on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:12,489
- You speak English.
- You speak English.

109
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,889
- You fooled me.
- And you me.

110
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:17,529
How long have you
been in Los Angeles?

111
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,529
I live here.

112
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:21,850
You live here? I don't understand.

113
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:26,009
You wouldn't. I'm just trying
to refresh my college French.

114
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:31,450
I usually practise with a friend,
but she's not here yet.

115
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,850
Where are you from?

116
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:48,329
I was born in Torino,

117
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,809
but I studied at Nantes.

118
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:52,969
You hardly have any accent at all.

119
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,809
Yeah, I've been travelling too much.

120
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:58,649
I envy you. I love to travel.

121
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:05,529
I used to travel a lot, but my
husband's involved in local politics.

122
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,969
So now I just practise French.

123
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,649
He thinks it's chic
to have a bilingual wife.

124
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,089
I think he's right.

125
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,889
Where are you going?

126
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:20,929
I made a mistake.

127
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,169
My husband's in New York.

128
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,369
What about your friend?

129
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,089
I'm not waiting for anyone.

130
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:41,409
- You still don't understand.
- Understand what?

131
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,449
Who I am.

132
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,769
Who are you?

133
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,369
You don't even understand
who you are, why you're sitting here.

134
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,329
Why are you here?

135
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:04,649
- I've got to go.
- All right. Just one thing.

136
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:07,049
Why did you come on to me?

137
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:10,049
Like I said, I made a mistake.

138
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,490
I heard you speaking French.

139
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:18,089
Often in these big hotels, you run
into women from foreign countries

140
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:22,130
who may need
a translator... or a guide.

141
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,569
And they hire you?

142
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,529
Yes.

143
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:36,250
How many languages do you speak?

144
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,289
Five or six.

145
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,729
Plus the... international language.

146
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,249
That's right.

147
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,169
Well, now,

148
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,609
you're something really
special, aren't you?

149
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,209
You're one to talk.

150
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:14,289
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.

151
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:16,049
I know what I see.

152
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:20,929
How much would you have charged me?

153
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:23,409
As what? Translator or guide?

154
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,369
No. Just one fuck.

155
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,970
Now you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.

156
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:34,169
You don't, huh?

157
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:38,209
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.

158
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:43,730
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Joste.

159
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,969
Look, someone's made a mistake here.
I don't do fags.

160
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,049
- I didn't mean that.
- Or couples.

161
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,929
No, no, no. You don't understand.

162
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:50,009
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.

163
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,929
Just her.

164
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:57,769
- But I can watch.
- Of course.

165
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,489
Would you like a drink?

166
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,969
Not yet.

167
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:14,689
- I think I'd like my money now.
- Sure. Sure.

168
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:18,449
- I like to talk after.
- Sure.

169
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,089
Hello, Judy.

170
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:58,890
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.

171
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:04,090
A very pretty woman. You'll like me.

172
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,089
I can tell...

173
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,169
because I like you. I like you.

174
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:16,089
So just relax and close your eyes.

175
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:20,969
Just relax
and let your mind run free.

176
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,689
Don't worry about anything.

177
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,209
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.

178
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,369
That's right. Close your eyes.

179
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:42,929
Forget about him.
This is just you and me.

180
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:46,049
No, no, no, from behind.

181
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:48,769
It has to be from behind.

182
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:56,089
Ok, baby, just flip over
on your stomach.

183
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,369
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,

184
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,009
'cause I'm going to take care of you.

185
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:09,169
I'm going to get you wet, very wet.

186
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,009
I know how to do this.

187
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,529
Now slap her.

188
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,009
Slap that cunt.

189
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:35,489
- Hey, Leon.
- How you doing, Jule?

190
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,409
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.

191
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:48,609
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his... boyfriends,

192
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:52,649
just banging away,
you know how it is. Dumb bastard.

193
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:56,289
- Hello, Julian.
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.

194
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:04,289
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.

195
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,049
I'm serious.
They want you back this week.

196
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,169
I wouldn't take much,
you know. It's...

197
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:13,690
They're regulars for me.

198
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,649
You lied, Leon.
It was a rough trick.

199
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:22,449
I forgot. You got scruples now, huh?

200
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:27,609
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.

201
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:30,129
They get possessive.

202
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:34,609
- I can't be possessed.
- Does that include Miss Anne?

203
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,449
Anne who?

204
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,530
I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.

205
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:46,849
I'll tell you why, Leon. She's got
a job coming up for me in a week.

206
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:48,729
Eight grand.

207
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,410
Can you get me that?

208
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:53,929
All right. All right.

209
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,129
Thanks, hon.

210
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,169
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
That bitch will sell you out.

211
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:06,369
But you really care about me,
don't you? Don't you, Leon?

212
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:08,410
You care.

213
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:12,530
You know, you walk
an awful thin line, Julian.

214
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:16,169
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
You're getting cocky.

215
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:20,569
The other boys are happy,
with a car, a house, but not you.

216
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:25,849
You got all your rich pussy lined up,
once-a-month tricks,

217
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,649
a dip in the pool,
a little tennis, and orgasm.

218
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:33,329
I'm just to warning you as a friend.

219
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:37,609
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.

220
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,330
You're sure about that?

221
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:43,649
They'll cut you out.

222
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,289
Yeah?

223
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,969
Says she's a friend?

224
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,049
Where does she know me from?

225
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,449
Yeah, send her up.

226
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:21,329
I'm Michelle.

227
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:33,009
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.

228
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:35,049
Are you surprised?

229
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,169
What do you want?

230
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:54,129
I would have thought that you'd live
in a place with thick red carpet,

231
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:57,529
- big bed, mirrors on the ceiling...
- Bordello.

232
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:03,049
This is my apartment.
Women don't come here.

233
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:10,089
- You're going out?
- Yeah.

234
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:15,130
Business?

235
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:20,049
- Maybe.
- Isn't it a little late?

236
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:24,329
- Isn't it late for you?
- My husband's still in New York.

237
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:25,970
I'm alone.

238
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:46,089
I thought it would be easier.

239
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,929
What did you say?

240
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:51,689
I said I thought it would be easier.

241
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:53,329
What?

242
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:57,849
To be with you, to procure you.

243
00:26:58,889 --> 00:27:01,089
I told you, you're mistaken.

244
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:23,689
Why are you doing this to me?

245
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,929
- What am I doing?
- Embarrassing me.

246
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:31,129
I'm not embarrassing you.

247
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,169
I can't keep up...

248
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:42,289
this front much longer.

249
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,409
I came here.

250
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:50,289
I found out who you were,
where you lived.

251
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,769
I came here
in the middle of the night.

252
00:27:55,729 --> 00:28:01,089
I wanted to know what...
it would be like... to fuck you.

253
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,169
I brought money.

254
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:12,289
What more can I do? I...

255
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:13,729
I...

256
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:17,849
I like...

257
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:23,249
I don't want to know.

258
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:55,849
Don't say that.

259
00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:00,329
You got me aroused
just thinking about it.

260
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:06,369
I'm lying here with a hard-on,
it's not even 10:00 yet.

261
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,209
Don't tease me.
Come on, baby, you're teasing me.

262
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:16,089
I'm gonna have to hang up
and jerk off right now. I am.

263
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:22,969
Yeah, I'm touching myself.
You like that, don't you?

264
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:29,289
Oh, come on, baby. Don't say that.

265
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:34,569
We're talking about having more
pleasure than you've had in years,

266
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:39,969
you got to bring up
some stupid little $1,200 stereo?

267
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,089
How much does your husband make?
What's he worth?

268
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:47,570
A couple of million?

269
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:52,409
Of course I could do without it.
I can listen to the radio.

270
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:54,449
The speaker's cracked.

271
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,209
Lisa. Lisa, listen to yourself.
You know what you're saying?

272
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,849
Can you hold on a second?
Somebody's at the door.

273
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,769
Good morning.

274
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:14,489
What do you want for breakfast?
Coffee, juice, croissant, eggs?

275
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:16,489
Julian Kay.

276
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:18,689
I want two coffee,
orange juice, croissant...

277
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:19,969
No eggs.

278
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,089
..one scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.

279
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:29,449
Lisa, I'm here with a hard-on,
people all over, I can't talk.

280
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:33,609
I'll see you about 5:00. Bye-bye.

281
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,609
So, what do you think?

282
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:43,769
About what?

283
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:48,649
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?

284
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:52,249
Was it what you expected?

285
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:55,369
No. It was like really making love.

286
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:59,129
I'm not used...

287
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,009
It's not what I expected.

288
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:07,369
Do you remember
what you said last night?

289
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,770
Yes.

290
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,369
Now, if I bid, I have to buy it.

291
00:31:17,449 --> 00:31:18,689
Right.

292
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,129
The one I want is over here.
There it is.

293
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:24,649
What does it say?

294
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:30,449
"Jacobean, late 17th century".
Estimated at 4,800 to 5,200.

295
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:33,769
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.

296
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,369
Yeah.

297
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:41,209
I don't know. My guess is this
is gonna go for 5,000. 55 maybe.

298
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:45,689
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.

299
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:48,649
At 48, that's a bargain.
What do you think?

300
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:55,329
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I... don't know.

301
00:31:55,409 --> 00:32:00,929
I saw a George III chest around here
somewhere, going for, like, 22, 23.

302
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,649
It's a lot, but a good investment.
Beautiful lines on it.

303
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:09,089
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garnisher set over there...

304
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:12,489
- What is it?
- Do you see who I see?

305
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,449
- Who is it?
- It's Randolph Sloan's widow.

306
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:18,449
- A stockholder in Jim's company.
- She's still alive?

307
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:20,849
She's gonna make a beeline for us.

308
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:22,849
There goes the garnisher set.

309
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:26,249
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

310
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:31,329
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy
before they face us.

311
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:34,569
Lucille!

312
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:37,809
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?

313
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,449
- Just looking.
- Oh, how nice!

314
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,489
There is an ex quisite
garnisher set over there!

315
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,889
Lucille,
this is Wilhelm Schoenfeld.

316
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:48,050
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.

317
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:50,209
Great hospitality, madame.

318
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:53,249
Oh, the dress! Look, the dress.

319
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:56,209
Beautiful dress. It goes
with her face. They're both beige.

320
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:57,249
Wilhelm.

321
00:32:59,009 --> 00:32:59,969
Madame!

322
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:06,169
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.

323
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:08,009
Lisa, we must go.

324
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,609
Did you see her face?

325
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,649
Come on.

326
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:12,729
I wish your husband would come back.

327
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:14,849
- He has.
- Good.

328
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:24,050
I can't stop thinking about you.

329
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:27,689
Do you mind?

330
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:35,129
What have you been doing?

331
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:39,329
- When?
- This morning.

332
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,729
Driving around.

333
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:46,529
I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.

334
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:49,209
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.

335
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,529
Then I drove here.

336
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:55,929
You know, Michelle,

337
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:58,969
I'm really not part of your problems.

338
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:01,809
I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.

339
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:05,649
I brought money.

340
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,049
Don't...

341
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:14,129
I don't want your money.

342
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:17,810
I'll buy you something, then.

343
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,529
- I'll buy you that stereo.
- I got a stereo.

344
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:24,049
What, then?

345
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,009
Come on.

346
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:37,769
- What?
- We're going to my room.

347
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,809
- You want it?
- No.

348
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:05,849
Good, ' cause you're
not gonna get it.

349
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,649
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.

350
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:13,489
God. Why?

351
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:16,649
I don't know. It seems important.

352
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:19,129
We just made love, didn't we?

353
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,009
Yes.

354
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:24,009
Then you know everything
there is to know.

355
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:27,009
That's silly. Where are you from?

356
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:29,649
I don't know. I'm not from anywhere.

357
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:34,130
I'm from this bed.

358
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:39,409
Anything worth knowing, you can learn
by letting me make love to you.

359
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,729
That's not true.

360
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,330
Why do you sleep with older women?

361
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,449
I prefer older women.

362
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:54,049
Why?

363
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:57,889
What's the use of bringing
some high-schooler to climax?

364
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:02,169
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.

365
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:06,649
No challenge.

366
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,690
It has no meaning.

367
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,450
The other night...

368
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:17,489
That night I met you
at the hotel...

369
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,689
I was with a woman...

370
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:22,529
Somebody's mother.

371
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:27,689
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.

372
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:30,329
She hadn't had an orgasm in 10 years.

373
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:35,169
Took me 3 hours to get her off.

374
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:38,529
For a while,
I didn't think I could do it.

375
00:38:40,129 --> 00:38:45,289
When it was over, I felt
like I'd done something worthwhile.

376
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:53,449
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?

377
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:58,649
My God.

378
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:02,969
These are not the handcuffs your wife
was wearing when she was killed.

379
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,689
Those we found in the study.

380
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:07,889
They were in a filing cabinet...

381
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:14,009
along with some dildos, paddles...
You know what I'm talking about.

382
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:19,529
Your private sex life is
of no concern to me or to the LAPD.

383
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,689
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted

384
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:29,369
suggests the killer may have
been a guest in your home once.

385
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:33,889
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.

386
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:38,729
However, I'll have to have
detailed information

387
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,369
about you and your
wife's sex practices...

388
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:46,889
and the names of any parties
that were involved. All right?

389
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:02,409
Sorry. Here you go. This, too.

390
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:04,929
I get the Salvation Army.

391
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:08,009
Mrs. Stewart.

392
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:14,170
Hi. Ex cuse me.
Does Mr. Julian Kay live here?

393
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:17,009
I'm Detective Sunday.

394
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,529
I'm with the homicide bureau.
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

395
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:23,489
What do you want?

396
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:25,769
You're Mr. Kay?

397
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:29,209
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?

398
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,529
Come on.

399
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:34,009
I'm walking into Westwood.
You want to talk there?

400
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:37,049
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later.

401
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,889
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.

402
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,929
You heard about the case?

403
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,329
- Yeah. It was in the paper, right?
- Yeah.

404
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,889
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.

405
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:58,929
- Yeah, I read about that.
- I bet.

406
00:40:59,009 --> 00:41:00,849
- Cup of coffee?
- Sure!

407
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:03,009
We'll sit in the back.

408
00:41:06,649 --> 00:41:09,049
Now, what were you doing
Tuesday night?

409
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:13,729
Tuesday.

410
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:16,170
Tuesday night, I was...

411
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:21,209
I was with a friend
at a pre-auction viewing.

412
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:23,689
She'll verify that?

413
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:28,249
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.

414
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:31,250
I think she enjoys her privacy.

415
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:36,129
..if that's what this is
to you. OK? I don't want it!

416
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:37,449
Come over here.

417
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,969
You can't mix May and December.
It just never...

418
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:46,330
Maybe she likes the guy, huh?

419
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:50,049
- I'm sorry.
- Am I a suspect?

420
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,729
No, but we'll have to check
your alibi for your sake.

421
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:57,889
Now, this work that you were
doing for the Rheimans,

422
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:01,609
was this as a translator
or a chauffeur?

423
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:05,169
Neither. This was...

424
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:08,329
This was more of a personal matter.

425
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,289
- You're friends?
- Not exactly.

426
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,649
Not exactly. All right, then.

427
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:20,329
What exactly is it
that you were doing for the Rheimans?

428
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:23,770
Nothing special.

429
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:25,529
Chit-chat. I don't know.

430
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:31,730
I have a hard time remembering
these things. I meet a lot of people.

431
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:34,969
Yes, yes.
No, I understand your problem.

432
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:38,929
You got there, you had a few drinks.
Next thing, you're back in LA?

433
00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:41,330
More or less.
You want another cup of coffee?

434
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:44,649
That's bullshit. I'm taking you in.
It'll be good for your memory.

435
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:49,329
You seem like a young man
who needs a little self-improvement.

436
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:55,450
Look, Mr. Sunday...

437
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:57,489
Detective Sunday.

438
00:42:59,129 --> 00:43:01,729
Look, Detective...

439
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:07,049
I want to cooperate with the police
in any way I can, but these...

440
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:09,609
these are very delicate matters...

441
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:15,289
things that may not fall
under the exact letter of the law.

442
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:18,969
Publicity's the last thing I want.

443
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,969
I'm not gonna book you or
take away your chauffeur's license.

444
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:29,769
I'm not gonna bring you up on drug
charges. I could do all of that.

445
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:31,809
Just tell me about the Rheimans.

446
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:36,730
Please welcome Charles Stratton.

447
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,490
Mack, thank you.

448
00:43:49,569 --> 00:43:53,089
I hope you're having
as good a time as us...

449
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:58,369
trying to figure out
what the stuff is on our plates.

450
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:01,889
But most of all,
I'm happy to have the opportunity

451
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,129
to speak to you in an informal way

452
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:08,449
about the problems
facing southern California.

453
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:12,129
More than any other
community in the country...

454
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:14,849
Do you follow
California politics, Julian?

455
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:17,249
Not very much.

456
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,089
You're smart. They're all whores.

457
00:44:20,169 --> 00:44:23,889
..but we also have the technological
means and know-how

458
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:28,329
to help free America
from the grip of fossil fuels.

459
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:31,849
In times of austerity like these,

460
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:35,529
it is the privileged
who should lead the way,

461
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:38,929
who should set an example
for the rest of the country.

462
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,089
This guy is a real comer.

463
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:02,249
She's pretty, isn't she?

464
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:04,009
Yes, very.

465
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,769
Jim, Thank you for coming.
You know Michelle.

466
00:45:07,729 --> 00:45:12,369
Mrs. Laudner, how nice of you to come.
It's a pleasure to see you.

467
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:14,729
Bullshit. Can we talk later?

468
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:17,649
Certainly. Mrs. Laudner,
my wife Michelle.

469
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:18,969
How do you do?

470
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:23,449
- And this is Julian Kay.
- It's an honour. Enjoyed the speech.

471
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:27,249
Mrs. Stratton.

472
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:30,970
You're a fortunate man, Senator.

473
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:36,769
- You know what he is.
- That boy will go far.

474
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:39,169
Got a nice wife, too.

475
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:42,329
- Tell me about them.
- I told you he's a comer.

476
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:46,169
No. I want to hear
about them as a couple.

477
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:49,369
- How is their marriage?
- Julian, you are incorrigible!

478
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:51,689
No, I want to hear about it.

479
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:53,729
I hear she's very unhappy.

480
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:56,449
- Julian!
- Well, hello.

481
00:47:56,529 --> 00:47:58,810
What a surprise.

482
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:03,329
- You do a lot of shopping here?
- No. Just browsing.

483
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,049
Just browsing.

484
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:08,809
Well, I gotta go.
Lot of appointments.

485
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:12,569
Been very nice talking to you...
Mrs. Stratton.

486
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:14,450
Wait.

487
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,129
I have to talk to you.

488
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:26,049
Yeah. Me, too.

489
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:29,049
Want to have a drink?

490
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:33,489
It's kind of early for a drink.

491
00:48:33,569 --> 00:48:37,689
Maybe we do that in about an hour.
What do you think?

492
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:39,729
I think you're awful.

493
00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:41,609
I think you're right.

494
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:43,049
Come on.

495
00:48:47,169 --> 00:48:49,609
I've seen your husband
on television.

496
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:53,289
He's very impressive.

497
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:55,329
What's that supposed to mean?

498
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:01,169
Nothing. I'm sorry.

499
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:06,209
I would never do anything
to hurt him politically.

500
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:09,569
I could never leave him.

501
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:14,009
Don't let him blackmail you.

502
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:17,289
He has this big
political thing about...

503
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:20,329
having... a family.

504
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:24,729
He keeps wanting me to be pregnant.

505
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:30,169
What are we talking about here?
What he wants or what you want?

506
00:49:30,249 --> 00:49:33,729
I can't tell any more.

507
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:38,369
What can I do?

508
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:43,450
I don't know.

509
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:45,609
Be yourself.

510
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:49,529
Leave him?

511
00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:53,689
His career will survive.

512
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:55,649
People forget.

513
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:01,169
These things have to
be done quietly.

514
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:11,489
Don't let him fool you with his talk
about duty and self-sacrifice.

515
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:16,409
He's getting exactly what he wants.
You've got to do the same.

516
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:18,970
Take your pleasure when you can.

517
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:24,449
How about you? Where do you come in?

518
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:27,649
How do you get pleasure?

519
00:50:55,649 --> 00:50:59,129
What a surprise. Mr. Kay.

520
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:01,129
Detective Sunday.

521
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,249
You are full of surprises.
Come on in. Sit down.

522
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:08,649
- Take a shine. You need it.
- Thank you. You're dressed up today.

523
00:51:08,729 --> 00:51:10,569
I'm going to the country club.

524
00:51:10,649 --> 00:51:14,449
To the country club.
We checked on your alibi.

525
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:19,329
Mrs. Williams said you had
been with her Tuesday night.

526
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:22,649
But...

527
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,129
you dropped her off at 7:00.

528
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,410
The Rheiman murder was at 10:00.

529
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:28,529
Shit.

530
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:32,529
I described the house, the bedroom.

531
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:34,729
She said
you were helping her redecorate

532
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,249
and you'd been picking
out a bureau...

533
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:40,489
I understand why.
She has a reputation to protect.

534
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:44,049
How do you do it, Julian?

535
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:49,689
This afternoon with Mrs. Jarvey
and tonight at the country club.

536
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:53,409
How do you seduce
all these women, huh?

537
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:57,409
I don't like you poking around
in my private life, Sunday...

538
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,009
bugging my friends.

539
00:52:01,809 --> 00:52:05,009
I'll tell you what.
You lay off my clients,

540
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:08,089
I'll give you a few pointers
picking up women.

541
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:10,009
How's that?

542
00:52:12,169 --> 00:52:14,929
First, obviously, you dress for shit.

543
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:19,729
Anybody can fix that, no problem.
It's your face. Bad face.

544
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:23,649
And that body? You have back
problems? You look like a monkey.

545
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:26,369
Hey, back. Shoulders back.

546
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:29,889
And your jaw, work the jaw.
Ex ercise. You don't want it slack.

547
00:52:29,969 --> 00:52:32,410
Up tight, tight. Tight, yes.

548
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:38,849
Would you be willing
to come in for a line-up?

549
00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:44,129
- Sure. Why not?
- Doesn't it ever bother you, Julian?

550
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,369
- What?
- What you do.

551
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:52,169
Giving pleasure to women?
I'm supposed to feel guilty?

552
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:56,769
- But it's not legal.
- Legal is not always right.

553
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:59,969
Men make laws.
Sometimes they're wrong.

554
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:05,489
They're stupid... or jealous.

555
00:53:05,569 --> 00:53:07,609
And you know better?

556
00:53:08,649 --> 00:53:10,889
Some people are above the law.

557
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:13,889
How do these people
know who they are?

558
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,369
They know.

559
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:19,649
They ask themselves.

560
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:23,169
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.

561
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:24,329
Yes, sir.

562
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:27,689
- May I?
- Please.

563
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:30,809
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.

564
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:36,329
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs. Rheiman?

565
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:42,289
- I didn't.
- Yeah, you said that.

566
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:44,929
That's why I checked twice
with the coroner.

567
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:48,449
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.

568
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,849
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.

569
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:56,210
Underneath the cuts were bruises from
where she was handcuffed earlier.

570
00:53:56,289 --> 00:53:59,489
The coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,

571
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,929
which would be the night
you were there.

572
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:07,569
Jesus Christ.

573
00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:11,689
She was beaten with
a heavy metal object,

574
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:14,849
raped and violated... with an object,

575
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:16,689
presumably the murder weapon.

576
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:36,530
Yeah.

577
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:40,809
Yeah, I handcuffed her.

578
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:47,289
But you gotta understand about
these people... like the Rheimans.

579
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:53,569
It's like a game to them.

580
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:56,129
I'll explain.

581
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:03,849
Julian.

582
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:06,849
Yeah? What is it?

583
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,049
They were here two hours...
the police.

584
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:13,010
They were here two hours.
They had a search warrant.

585
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:14,769
It's all right. It's OK.

586
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:16,529
What's going on?

587
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:48,530
Jill, it's Julian.

588
00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:50,450
No, it's OK, it's OK.

589
00:55:50,529 --> 00:55:52,289
Send the maid up now.

590
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:13,409
Hi. How you doing, Timmy?

591
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,489
Julian! You're becoming
a regular visitor. What's happening?

592
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:20,809
There's something
I want to talk about.

593
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:23,529
I don't like anybody
here when Tim visits.

594
00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:28,129
Courts might not
let me see him at all.

595
00:56:28,209 --> 00:56:30,529
Let's go down to the beach, then.

596
00:56:52,729 --> 00:56:54,929
Watch out.

597
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:57,489
Thank you.

598
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:02,929
I think I'm in a frame.

599
00:57:03,009 --> 00:57:06,010
- Who's putting you in?
- I don't know.

600
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,489
All I see is a frame.

601
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:11,369
It's that Rheiman murder
out in Palm Springs.

602
00:57:11,449 --> 00:57:13,529
You tricked with them?

603
00:57:13,609 --> 00:57:16,409
Once. Just once. Favour to Leon.

604
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:19,889
- Two-timing bastard.
- I'm nice. I can't help it.

605
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,689
You check around for me?

606
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:24,489
Why don't you ask
your new friend Leon?

607
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:26,969
I may just do that.

608
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:30,569
You trick for other people,
cheat me out of money,

609
00:57:30,649 --> 00:57:34,689
and then when you need a favour,
you come back to me.

610
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:39,529
If I help you...
you'll have to help me.

611
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,569
How?

612
00:57:41,649 --> 00:57:46,369
You'll have to come back to me,
work strictly for me.

613
00:57:46,449 --> 00:57:49,529
Wait a minute.
It's got nothing to do with that.

614
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:52,769
Like shit it doesn't.
I made you, Julie.

615
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:56,369
I taught you everything you know,
how to dress, how to behave,

616
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:58,729
how to treat women, how to make love.

617
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,930
Then you say, "I'm too good for you,"
and cut me out.

618
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:05,409
It ain't right, Julie.

619
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:09,769
Things are different.
I'm more than I used to be.

620
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:15,569
I'm getting older, Anne.
I got to keep moving forward.

621
00:58:15,649 --> 00:58:18,609
Please, Julie, save me the speeches.

622
00:58:20,329 --> 00:58:24,249
- How's your Swedish coming?
- I'll be ready.

623
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:26,409
She's flying in
from Stockholm on Thursday.

624
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:31,889
She apparently has certain
sexual idiosyncrasies.

625
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:35,290
Are you going to come back with me?

626
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:42,369
- You did it, didn't you?
- What?

627
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:45,409
The Rheiman killing.

628
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:55,529
Don't worry, Julie.
It doesn't matter.

629
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:06,169
Thank you.
It's been a wonderful evening.

630
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:14,729
- Can I see you again tomorrow?
- How about this one?

631
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:18,449
There was a sexy
girl from Borgan Place...

632
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:23,249
Do you live alone?

633
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:27,929
It's such a sweet face.

634
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:39,169
- No, not yet.
- Why not?

635
00:59:39,249 --> 00:59:42,329
- Let's just kiss some more, OK?
- What's wrong?

636
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:47,290
Nothing's wrong. I just don't...
want to make love.

637
00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:56,289
I love to be with you.

638
00:59:56,369 --> 01:00:00,009
I love it when you kiss me
and when you touch me,

639
01:00:00,089 --> 01:00:03,049
but when you make love,
you go to work.

640
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:08,769
If it's your period, I don't mind.

641
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:11,849
Don't give me that.
You know what I'm talking about.

642
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:14,170
I can't give you any pleasure,

643
01:00:14,249 --> 01:00:17,169
and you can't fool me any more.

644
01:00:17,249 --> 01:00:19,250
You don't know what you're saying.

645
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:22,289
Yes, I do... and so do you.

646
01:00:32,609 --> 01:00:35,929
Yeah, I know.

647
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:41,849
You're talking about me giving up
what I am, what I do.

648
01:00:42,729 --> 01:00:44,689
Is that so shocking?

649
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:54,329
I care about you. I really do.

650
01:01:00,169 --> 01:01:02,609
That's still not enough.

651
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,969
It's all I'm good at.

652
01:01:10,049 --> 01:01:12,009
That's not true.

653
01:01:13,329 --> 01:01:16,649
It doesn't matter.
I can't quit anyway.

654
01:01:16,729 --> 01:01:20,169
If I quit, I'm out on a limb.

655
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:23,929
Well, then we'd be even.
I'm already out on one.

656
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:31,609
People I know
take care of each other.

657
01:01:34,689 --> 01:01:37,089
I need their protection.

658
01:01:40,889 --> 01:01:45,409
I'm being framed by somebody.
I don't know who.

659
01:01:47,169 --> 01:01:51,209
There was a murder, Palm Springs,
a couple weeks ago.

660
01:01:51,289 --> 01:01:53,289
Police think I did it.

661
01:01:55,049 --> 01:01:58,209
It was a woman. A woman I met once.

662
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:02,889
I wasn't there,
but my alibi completely denies it.

663
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,929
- Why would anyone do that to you?
- I can't figure that out.

664
01:02:07,009 --> 01:02:10,369
- It doesn't make any sense.
- When was the murder?

665
01:02:10,449 --> 01:02:12,530
A week ago Tuesday.

666
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:19,689
- Weren't we together that night?
- Baby, I wish we were.

667
01:02:33,929 --> 01:02:36,289
All right,
boys, stand full-face, please.

668
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:37,889
This is bullshit. These cops...

669
01:02:37,969 --> 01:02:40,529
Number three, take off your glasses.

670
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:46,369
Number two, straighten up.

671
01:02:47,449 --> 01:02:49,010
Turn to your right.

672
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:53,729
No, Number three, to your right.

673
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,009
Jerk.

674
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:57,049
How much you getting paid?

675
01:02:57,129 --> 01:03:00,369
What are you talking about?
I'm just a con.

676
01:03:00,449 --> 01:03:04,009
So am I. I'm getting 15.

677
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:07,809
- You are?
- Yeah. 15 bucks.

678
01:03:07,889 --> 01:03:09,729
Now left, please.

679
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:13,529
Left.

680
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:17,369
Thank you.

681
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:24,209
- The wino's getting 20.
- You're kidding.

682
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:27,249
You ain't getting paid,
you're getting screwed.

683
01:03:27,329 --> 01:03:29,689
Shit! What the fuck's going on?

684
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:32,569
I want to speak to my lawyer!

685
01:03:32,649 --> 01:03:35,249
You'll see your lawyer.
Get in line.

686
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:37,449
Make sure I speak to him.

687
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:40,850
Number one, turn to your right.

688
01:03:40,929 --> 01:03:45,289
I know my rights. This isn't Russia.
We have a constitution here.

689
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:50,009
- I know my rights.
- Thank you. You can leave now.

690
01:03:50,089 --> 01:03:52,969
How about this fuckin' jerk
here, three.

691
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:56,890
You getting paid, too?
What the fuck is going on?

692
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:02,849
Well, what do you think?

693
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:06,249
- Not bad.
- I'm gonna steal your thunder.

694
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:08,649
He's teaching me how to dress.

695
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:11,489
This is Lieutenant Curtis
from Palm Springs.

696
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,369
He's...

697
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:17,729
- He's in charge of this case.
- Wait a minute. I thought you were?

698
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:21,409
No, I'm in charge
of pimps, prostitutes and hustlers.

699
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:25,169
Pretty low on the pole.
Good joke, huh?

700
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:31,289
You've been identified, Julian.

701
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,729
- Julian.
- By whom?

702
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:37,329
Who could possibly identify me?

703
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:40,370
You parked 50 feet
from the Rheiman house

704
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:42,409
around 10:00 on the 22nd,

705
01:04:42,489 --> 01:04:45,850
proceeded up the street
and entered the house.

706
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:50,409
- Someone saw you.
- I request formal charges...

707
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:54,449
I don't understand.
Who would say this? I was not there.

708
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:57,729
Then she identified
subject number one.

709
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:02,609
Then she wasn't sure
which one of you it was.

710
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:10,169
- You got the license number?
- She didn't see it.

711
01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:12,009
- Shit!
- Right.

712
01:05:12,089 --> 01:05:13,529
Here.

713
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:18,089
We looked around your house.
We had a warrant.

714
01:05:18,169 --> 01:05:20,649
- We know.
- You recognise these?

715
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:23,849
- They were under your mattress.
- So what?

716
01:05:23,929 --> 01:05:28,249
They had Mrs. Rheiman's fingerprints
all over them. That's so what.

717
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:31,289
- Did you find the jewels?
- What jewels?

718
01:05:31,369 --> 01:05:34,689
I read the paper, too.
Jewels stolen from Rheiman's house.

719
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:37,690
Whoever planted that money
probably planted the jewels.

720
01:05:37,769 --> 01:05:39,329
There were no jewels.

721
01:05:39,409 --> 01:05:42,809
Didn't you ever wonder
this may be a frame?

722
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:46,610
- It occurred to us.
- It occurred to you.

723
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:50,089
- Did you check Rheiman?
- He has an alibi.

724
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:53,809
- Big deal.
- You're grasping at straws.

725
01:05:53,889 --> 01:05:56,569
What about Leon James, the black guy?

726
01:05:56,649 --> 01:06:01,010
- He said you were high-class.
- What do you think?

727
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,729
I think you're guilty as sin.

728
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:13,569
I think you went to the Rheimans',

729
01:06:13,649 --> 01:06:16,489
did a trick,
played some rough games.

730
01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:19,409
You got drugged or stupid or both.

731
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:23,569
You beat her, killed her,
stole the money and the jewels.

732
01:06:24,969 --> 01:06:28,729
Then there's no use talking further
until you press charges.

733
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:32,729
Whether we think Julian's guilty...
we're not going to arrest him.

734
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:34,489
If you're being framed,

735
01:06:34,569 --> 01:06:37,969
you're gonna be more use to us
floating around.

736
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:43,009
Can we go now?

737
01:06:54,809 --> 01:06:57,929
Just one more thing, Julian...

738
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:02,969
don't tell cons
they get paid for line-ups.

739
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:06,010
Some cops don't have
a sense of humour.

740
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:06,289
Hi. I'm here
to see Mrs. Williams.

741
01:08:06,369 --> 01:08:10,369
- I'm Julian Kay.
- I'll take care of this, Wilma.

742
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:15,929
- Julian, why are you here?
- Can I talk to you?

743
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,969
What about?

744
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,329
Were the police here?

745
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:24,529
There was a detective here.

746
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:28,289
I was very surprised
you used my name.

747
01:08:28,369 --> 01:08:31,769
I'm very, very sorry
about that, Lisa,

748
01:08:31,849 --> 01:08:34,610
but this is very important to me.

749
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:36,689
I told him the truth.

750
01:08:36,769 --> 01:08:41,449
Lisa, you didn't,
I was with you until after midnight.

751
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:43,369
That's not the truth.

752
01:08:43,449 --> 01:08:45,809
Julian, I can't...

753
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:47,689
you weren't here.

754
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:49,690
What is it, dear?

755
01:08:49,769 --> 01:08:51,089
This is Julian Kay,

756
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:54,490
the one who is helping
with the decorating.

757
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:59,369
The boy who said he was with me
the night of that murder.

758
01:08:59,449 --> 01:09:03,969
Mr. Kay, it's bad enough
you made a fool of my wife

759
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:06,010
But then spreading lies...

760
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:09,009
- Leave us alone.
- I wasn't lying.

761
01:09:09,089 --> 01:09:13,849
Whatever you did, you won't
to get out of it by dragging...

762
01:09:13,929 --> 01:09:16,289
I just came here for the truth.

763
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:20,769
- I know you're lying.
- How do you know I'm lying?

764
01:09:20,849 --> 01:09:25,649
Because I was here with my wife
the entire evening.

765
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:27,489
Thank you, Mr. Kay.

766
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:32,969
You're not very good at this.

767
01:10:33,049 --> 01:10:36,209
- What?
- Following people. You're lousy.

768
01:10:36,329 --> 01:10:39,689
- What are you talking about?
- Who's paying you?

769
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:42,809
- You're not a cop.
- I'm calling the police.

770
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:45,649
You want to call? Go ahead, call.

771
01:10:45,729 --> 01:10:47,770
What have we got here?

772
01:10:47,849 --> 01:10:50,209
Floyd... Floyd Wicker. Nice name.

773
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,609
Born 7-23-52.

774
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:54,529
Hawthorne Avenue, LA.

775
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:56,609
Driver's license, American Express,

776
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:59,409
Mastercharge,
picture of girlfriend...

777
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:03,009
So-so,
eyes too close together, Floyd.

778
01:11:03,089 --> 01:11:04,969
What else have we got?

779
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,129
California State
Congressional Library pass,

780
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:10,729
California State identification,
California...

781
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:14,569
State Senate pass...

782
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,570
Senator Charles Stratton.

783
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:20,129
- Who the fuck are you?
- You can read.

784
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:25,369
Here.

785
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,289
You work for Senator Stratton?

786
01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:30,970
Yes.

787
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:37,329
- Why are you following me?
- I was told to.

788
01:11:37,409 --> 01:11:39,969
- By the senator?
- Who else?

789
01:11:40,049 --> 01:11:43,769
Why didn't he ask me
about my private life himself?

790
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:48,809
Huh? You don't know. You don't know.

791
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:52,370
Well, Floyd, I'm gonna
make this easy for you

792
01:11:52,449 --> 01:11:54,209
so you don't forget.

793
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:56,329
This is my telephone number.

794
01:11:56,409 --> 01:12:00,969
Now, you tell... the senator
if he wants to talk to me...

795
01:12:01,049 --> 01:12:04,409
he can just give me a call,
all right?

796
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:07,450
Now, you fuck off
and leave me alone!

797
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:39,769
I received your message, Mr. Kay.

798
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:44,890
- Thought I'd see you.
- Good evening, Senator.

799
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:47,569
- A vodka tonic.
- Yes, sir.

800
01:12:48,969 --> 01:12:50,609
This is heartwarming.

801
01:12:50,689 --> 01:12:54,369
Nice to see you haven't lost touch
with your constituency.

802
01:12:54,449 --> 01:12:58,129
I'm not talking as a senator,
but as a husband.

803
01:12:58,209 --> 01:13:00,809
That's too bad. I'm not a wife.

804
01:13:02,649 --> 01:13:04,289
Very funny.

805
01:13:05,369 --> 01:13:07,009
What do you want?

806
01:13:07,089 --> 01:13:10,609
- Want?
- I know who you are.

807
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:13,209
I can't stop my wife being a fool,

808
01:13:13,329 --> 01:13:16,729
but I can stop her
from being blackmailed.

809
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:25,210
- I don't know what you mean.
- You don't?

810
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:29,729
The police think you're involved
in a murder in Palm Springs.

811
01:13:29,809 --> 01:13:34,009
Three days later,
you seduced my wife at a fund-raiser

812
01:13:34,089 --> 01:13:36,689
to blackmail me into helping you.

813
01:13:39,009 --> 01:13:42,369
- You're crazy, mister.
- Am I?

814
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:58,729
Last night, my wife asked me
about the Rheiman murder.

815
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:02,129
Didn't make any sense
till I heard about you.

816
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:05,489
You talked to Michelle about this?

817
01:14:08,369 --> 01:14:10,330
You're not gonna blackmail me.

818
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:12,569
You don't know anything about this.

819
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:15,729
But I do know a whore when I see one.

820
01:14:15,809 --> 01:14:17,369
How much?

821
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,449
Not to see your wife again?

822
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:28,329
5,000.

823
01:14:31,809 --> 01:14:34,409
You'll have the cash in the morning.

824
01:14:38,769 --> 01:14:42,129
I'm seeing Michelle
because I want to see her...

825
01:14:42,209 --> 01:14:44,809
and because she wants to see me.

826
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:48,929
I don't want a dime from you.

827
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:03,609
That may be even simpler.

828
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:07,649
You live off the good graces
of a few people,

829
01:15:07,729 --> 01:15:11,770
like Mrs. Andros,
who was at the door a minute ago...

830
01:15:11,849 --> 01:15:14,409
and of places such as this.

831
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:16,449
You're just a hanger-on.

832
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:20,649
Unless you want to find
a new crowd to hang onto,

833
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,689
don't see my wife again.

834
01:16:23,569 --> 01:16:26,089
- How you doing?
- Not bad. How about you?

835
01:16:26,169 --> 01:16:28,649
I'm looking for Leon James.
Seen him around?

836
01:16:28,729 --> 01:16:31,369
Yeah. He's probably at Probe.

837
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,650
OK. Thanks. Take care.

838
01:17:03,849 --> 01:17:05,209
Hey, Julie.

839
01:17:56,369 --> 01:17:58,449
Hey, Jason.

840
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:01,169
I haven't seen you lately.
What brings you here?

841
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,169
Have you seen Leon around?

842
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:06,529
Oh, yeah.
He was showing off his new boy.

843
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:09,169
I think he's over there someplace.

844
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:11,009
OK, thanks.

845
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:32,169
Hey, Julie!
I thought that was you.

846
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:35,329
I've been looking for you.
I want to talk.

847
01:18:35,409 --> 01:18:38,009
- Let's go out back.
- OK.

848
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:41,769
What you doing here?

849
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:44,369
You... coming from a funeral?

850
01:18:44,449 --> 01:18:47,329
I hear you're
showing off a new boy.

851
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:51,729
I'm gonna make sure none
of these fruits snatch him from me.

852
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:58,569
You heard anything
about the Rheiman killing?

853
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:00,609
That's all I've heard about.

854
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:03,209
Cops on my ass like white on rice.

855
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:08,369
- They're giving me the third degree.
- Everybody else, too.

856
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:10,689
I may need your help.

857
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:12,969
I don't have an alibi.

858
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:16,170
You're the one that sent me.

859
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,569
You need one?

860
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:22,209
Yeah.

861
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:24,569
I'll see what I can do.

862
01:19:32,089 --> 01:19:34,329
Who do you think killed her?

863
01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:37,409
If I was the police,

864
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:42,169
I'd be more interested in Rheiman.
He's a freak, you know.

865
01:19:42,209 --> 01:19:46,489
He's a freak...
but he's got an alibi.

866
01:19:46,569 --> 01:19:48,489
An alibi?

867
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:53,089
Julie, I got something working
tonight, a little thing.

868
01:19:53,169 --> 01:19:56,529
I'll cut you in on it
if you're interested.

869
01:19:56,609 --> 01:19:58,489
Straight?

870
01:19:58,569 --> 01:20:01,209
This time of night? Are you serious?

871
01:20:02,329 --> 01:20:04,929
Leon, I'm sick of doing your shit.

872
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:08,129
No more fag stuff.
No more kink. Nothing.

873
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:11,969
- Finito! Got it?
- I heard about your problems.

874
01:20:12,049 --> 01:20:14,009
What problems?

875
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:17,489
Your clientele, Julie,
your rich pussy.

876
01:20:17,569 --> 01:20:20,849
They won't touch you.
They say it's too hot.

877
01:20:20,929 --> 01:20:24,969
- They're looking for new boys.
- Fuck ' em. Fuck ' em!

878
01:20:25,049 --> 01:20:27,329
Hey, Julie, listen...

879
01:20:27,409 --> 01:20:31,169
you ask me to help you
out of a tight spot,

880
01:20:31,209 --> 01:20:33,129
I'm glad to do it.

881
01:20:33,209 --> 01:20:37,129
But I ask you to do my trick,
you say no.

882
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:41,129
Now, how you expect me
to help you, huh?

883
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:45,449
You give me the alibi,
then we'll talk about tricks.

884
01:21:06,849 --> 01:21:10,289
- I have to talk to you.
- Hey, baby.

885
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:12,569
God, I'm glad to see you.

886
01:21:14,489 --> 01:21:17,769
Are you OK? You look so worn out.

887
01:21:17,849 --> 01:21:19,689
I didn't sleep much.

888
01:21:19,769 --> 01:21:22,929
- Want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

889
01:21:23,009 --> 01:21:24,569
I'll get my shoes.

890
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:32,929
What's wrong?
Are you gonna tell me about it?

891
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:38,569
Hey.

892
01:21:39,969 --> 01:21:42,770
Hey... you.

893
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,649
Come on, tell me.

894
01:21:49,849 --> 01:21:53,169
When I said I didn't want
to make love to you,

895
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:56,449
I didn't mean it. I want to fuck you.

896
01:21:56,529 --> 01:21:58,849
I always want to fuck you.

897
01:22:08,649 --> 01:22:12,009
- Is that what you came to tell me?
- No.

898
01:22:12,089 --> 01:22:15,410
Charles asked me to leave
for two months,

899
01:22:15,489 --> 01:22:19,809
till the primaries are over.
I'm going to Rome.

900
01:22:24,209 --> 01:22:25,769
Two months...

901
01:22:28,889 --> 01:22:32,089
I'll be back. Wait for me.

902
01:22:35,969 --> 01:22:39,889
I don't know if I can.
The police searched my apartment.

903
01:22:39,969 --> 01:22:42,689
- Maybe Charles...
- That's not what I'm saying.

904
01:22:51,129 --> 01:22:53,329
I don't know what I'm saying.

905
01:23:02,369 --> 01:23:06,209
All my life... I've been
looking for something.

906
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:08,089
I don't even know what it is.

907
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:11,009
- Let me...
- Maybe you're what I'm looking for.

908
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:19,889
I gave Charles my word.
I've got to go.

909
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:23,769
It'll be all right.

910
01:23:26,049 --> 01:23:27,929
Yeah.

911
01:23:28,009 --> 01:23:30,209
I have to leave.

912
01:27:52,969 --> 01:27:54,449
Shit!

913
01:29:20,169 --> 01:29:23,369
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

914
01:29:23,449 --> 01:29:26,529
- Tell me.
- I don't know. Honest.

915
01:29:26,609 --> 01:29:29,169
The police have been
here all morning.

916
01:29:29,249 --> 01:29:33,129
- Another cop's in his room.
- Does he call in?

917
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:35,009
I'm not supposed to tell.

918
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:39,169
OK. Next time he calls in
I've gotta talk to him.

919
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,609
Ask if I can meet him.

920
01:29:53,809 --> 01:29:57,209
Do you know a blonde kid
that hangs around with Leon James?

921
01:29:57,289 --> 01:29:59,369
Nah. Couldn't tell you.

922
01:30:15,529 --> 01:30:19,609
Anne, I'm sorry.
I've got to talk to you.

923
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:23,409
I can't now.
I'm looking for somebody.

924
01:30:23,489 --> 01:30:25,929
Perino's? Look, I don't have time.

925
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:30,689
Yeah, all right, Perino's. Yes, 8:30.

926
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:46,289
Jill, this is Julian.

927
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:50,809
Yeah, I know.
You got some messages for me?

928
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:56,289
Michelle?

929
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:02,889
Tell her to meet me at Perino's.

930
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:09,249
Son of a bitch, it's Rheiman.

931
01:31:41,169 --> 01:31:44,129
Mr. Julian.
You can't come in like this.

932
01:31:44,209 --> 01:31:46,049
I was working. I forgot.

933
01:31:46,129 --> 01:31:49,089
- I'll get you a jacket.
- No, it's OK.

934
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:57,369
Julie, you look like shit.
What's wrong?

935
01:31:57,449 --> 01:32:00,730
- Everything. Straight bourbon.
- What are you doing?

936
01:32:00,809 --> 01:32:04,689
The way you look
you couldn't get a maid to fuck you.

937
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:09,609
Anne, the cops are after me. They're
framing me for the Rheiman murder.

938
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:12,449
- Where have you been?
- Looking for somebody.

939
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,289
Last night?

940
01:32:14,369 --> 01:32:18,569
Mrs. Farfter came in last night
on a flight from Stockholm.

941
01:32:18,649 --> 01:32:22,689
There was no one there to meet her.
She was furious.

942
01:32:22,769 --> 01:32:25,649
I've got hell to pay. What happened?

943
01:32:25,729 --> 01:32:27,449
Did you hear me?

944
01:32:27,529 --> 01:32:31,049
I said the cops are after me...
for murder.

945
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:33,089
So you stand me up.

946
01:32:33,169 --> 01:32:35,089
Jesus Christ!

947
01:32:37,249 --> 01:32:38,809
What do you want?

948
01:32:44,009 --> 01:32:45,769
Are you gonna help me?

949
01:32:46,849 --> 01:32:51,329
I've checked around, Julie.
You are in trouble.

950
01:32:51,409 --> 01:32:53,609
That's why I need your help.

951
01:32:53,689 --> 01:32:56,249
You never did anything for me.

952
01:32:56,329 --> 01:32:58,089
Never did anything for...

953
01:32:58,169 --> 01:33:02,649
- I'm your number-one boy.
- And you fight me every turn.

954
01:33:02,729 --> 01:33:07,169
You ask favours, then blow a gig
I worked six months to arrange.

955
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:10,329
- I explained that already.
- I'm through, Julie.

956
01:33:10,409 --> 01:33:12,609
You'll have to fend for yourself.

957
01:33:12,689 --> 01:33:16,049
I don't care
what happens to you any more.

958
01:33:28,129 --> 01:33:30,089
Ex cuse me. I'll be back.

959
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:47,689
Julian, thank God you got my message.
I've been looking for you.

960
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:49,969
It's all right, baby. It's OK.

961
01:33:50,049 --> 01:33:53,729
No, it's not all right.
Charles talked to the DA.

962
01:33:53,809 --> 01:33:57,089
They found the weapon.
They're going to arrest you.

963
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:59,409
That can't be. It can't be.

964
01:33:59,489 --> 01:34:01,809
What are you going to do?

965
01:34:01,889 --> 01:34:03,769
I don't know.

966
01:34:08,929 --> 01:34:11,249
What can I do to help?

967
01:34:11,329 --> 01:34:14,289
- Nothing.
- There's gotta be something.

968
01:34:14,369 --> 01:34:17,129
Don't you understand?
I'm in big trouble.

969
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:19,209
- Just stay away.
- No.

970
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:23,009
There's gonna be a scandal.
You know what a scandal is?

971
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:26,209
You know what that's like?
Stay away from me.

972
01:34:26,289 --> 01:34:29,889
I'll ruin your life, your husband's.
It's all over.

973
01:34:29,969 --> 01:34:31,609
Not if you're innocent.

974
01:34:32,889 --> 01:34:37,729
How do you know I'm innocent?
Look at me, right in the face

975
01:34:37,809 --> 01:34:41,489
Can you tell me without hesitation
you know I'm innocent?

976
01:34:41,569 --> 01:34:43,129
Yes.

977
01:34:49,129 --> 01:34:50,689
Listen, forget me.

978
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:52,369
Is someone in there?

979
01:34:52,449 --> 01:34:54,009
I never loved you.

980
01:37:04,689 --> 01:37:07,889
- Julie?
- Let me in. It's important.

981
01:37:12,129 --> 01:37:16,169
You look terrible.
You want to clean up, shave?

982
01:37:16,249 --> 01:37:20,769
I'm sorry to bug you this late.
I've been looking for you.

983
01:37:23,049 --> 01:37:24,609
I'm listening.

984
01:37:26,249 --> 01:37:30,369
You got my alibi ready?
I'm gonna need it today.

985
01:37:30,449 --> 01:37:33,089
It's not ready yet, Julie. Tomorrow.

986
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:35,369
I'm still piecing it together.

987
01:37:36,529 --> 01:37:40,129
It's not easy.
I'm trying to get it right.

988
01:37:40,209 --> 01:37:43,450
- Why are you framing me?
- What?

989
01:37:43,529 --> 01:37:48,049
Judy Rheiman's murder...
you were behind it. You, Rheiman,

990
01:37:48,129 --> 01:37:51,410
your cute little blonde
boyfriend in the bedroom there,

991
01:37:51,489 --> 01:37:54,290
who planted the jewels in my car.

992
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:56,849
I don't know
what you're talking about.

993
01:37:56,929 --> 01:37:59,689
What the fuck is that, then?

994
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:03,210
He's the one that
actually killed her, isn't he?

995
01:38:05,369 --> 01:38:07,609
Leon, what happened?

996
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:11,529
You sent him out there
with Rheiman and his wife,

997
01:38:11,609 --> 01:38:14,289
he got rough and he killed her.

998
01:38:14,369 --> 01:38:16,249
Shut your fucking face!

999
01:38:16,329 --> 01:38:19,569
I never saw that shit
before in my life.

1000
01:38:19,649 --> 01:38:21,889
I want to know one thing.

1001
01:38:21,969 --> 01:38:25,409
What will it cost
to get you off my back?

1002
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:28,049
You ain't talking money,
you're talking murder.

1003
01:38:28,129 --> 01:38:31,049
- How much?
- I feel sorry for you.

1004
01:38:31,129 --> 01:38:32,369
How much?

1005
01:38:33,969 --> 01:38:37,329
It don't make no difference
how much, Julie.

1006
01:38:37,409 --> 01:38:40,289
The other side will always pay more.

1007
01:38:57,769 --> 01:38:59,969
Got it on real tight, huh?

1008
01:39:04,489 --> 01:39:07,649
You're real proud
of yourself, aren't you?

1009
01:39:07,729 --> 01:39:11,689
The police found the murder weapon
a block from your apartment.

1010
01:39:12,769 --> 01:39:14,769
That bitch in Palm Springs

1011
01:39:14,849 --> 01:39:19,769
is gonna change her mind
any time now and identify you.

1012
01:39:20,849 --> 01:39:24,289
Police want you real bad, Julie.

1013
01:39:24,369 --> 01:39:26,329
Now they got you.

1014
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:46,929
Look, I'm worth maybe...
20, 30 grand. It's yours.

1015
01:39:51,689 --> 01:39:54,369
I'll break your new boys for you.

1016
01:39:57,489 --> 01:39:59,849
I'll work just for you.

1017
01:39:59,929 --> 01:40:01,690
Just for you, Leon,

1018
01:40:01,769 --> 01:40:04,289
40/60 split.

1019
01:40:04,369 --> 01:40:06,449
It's fair, 40/60.

1020
01:40:07,529 --> 01:40:09,049
40...

1021
01:40:10,529 --> 01:40:12,489
30/70. I'll...

1022
01:40:14,249 --> 01:40:16,849
I'll do fag tricks. I'll do kink.

1023
01:40:16,929 --> 01:40:19,649
I'll do anything you want me to!

1024
01:40:21,529 --> 01:40:24,569
Leave me alone and get out, Julie.

1025
01:40:30,729 --> 01:40:32,489
Why me?

1026
01:40:34,449 --> 01:40:36,449
Why did you pick me?

1027
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:41,649
Because you were framable, Julie.

1028
01:40:43,569 --> 01:40:46,489
You stepped on too many toes.

1029
01:40:46,569 --> 01:40:49,129
Nobody cared about you.

1030
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:53,209
I never liked you much myself.

1031
01:40:55,089 --> 01:40:56,929
Now get out.

1032
01:41:02,769 --> 01:41:05,529
Who's down there?

1033
01:41:07,049 --> 01:41:09,569
Your new boyfriend? You motherfucker!

1034
01:41:13,249 --> 01:41:14,889
Oh, my God!

1035
01:41:14,969 --> 01:41:19,489
Don't let me fall!
Please, Julie, help me!

1036
01:41:19,569 --> 01:41:22,249
Don't fall. I need you.

1037
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:24,129
Give me your hand.

1038
01:41:24,209 --> 01:41:26,569
- Reach up.
- I'm trying.

1039
01:41:27,649 --> 01:41:29,529
Help me. Help me, please!

1040
01:41:29,609 --> 01:41:33,089
God! Don't fall!

1041
01:42:44,569 --> 01:42:47,169
Julian!
Would you answer a few questions?

1042
01:42:48,249 --> 01:42:51,689
- Who was involved?
- How old are you?

1043
01:42:51,769 --> 01:42:55,289
How long had you
been seeing Mrs. Rheiman?

1044
01:42:55,369 --> 01:43:00,009
- Any Hollywood notables?
- How much money have you made?

1045
01:43:00,089 --> 01:43:02,889
Julian, give me an ex clusive.

1046
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:06,649
How much do you get for a trick?

1047
01:43:06,729 --> 01:43:09,529
Give me a break, Julian.

1048
01:43:09,609 --> 01:43:12,849
Do you feel
you're being framed, Julian?

1049
01:43:12,929 --> 01:43:15,969
Were you ever afraid of the husbands?

1050
01:43:40,089 --> 01:43:42,849
I wish I had arrested you earlier.

1051
01:43:42,929 --> 01:43:45,169
It would've been easier
for everybody.

1052
01:43:45,249 --> 01:43:47,649
You'd better end
this pretrial publicity.

1053
01:43:47,729 --> 01:43:50,689
We're moving him
to Palm Springs soon.

1054
01:43:53,409 --> 01:43:55,689
You have anything to say, Julian?

1055
01:44:06,490 --> 01:44:08,249
Julian?

1056
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:13,689
No.

1057
01:44:46,689 --> 01:44:48,449
Hello, Julian.

1058
01:44:49,729 --> 01:44:51,729
Going away on your trip?

1059
01:44:51,809 --> 01:44:54,209
No. I decided not to.

1060
01:44:56,529 --> 01:44:59,929
- Does your husband know you're here?
- No.

1061
01:45:01,809 --> 01:45:03,410
Why did you come?

1062
01:45:05,969 --> 01:45:09,249
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

1063
01:45:13,529 --> 01:45:15,369
Don't come back, Michelle.

1064
01:45:23,769 --> 01:45:26,049
Are you satisfied with your lawyer?

1065
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:29,169
It doesn't matter.

1066
01:45:30,409 --> 01:45:32,049
Don't go.

1067
01:45:54,689 --> 01:45:58,649
Michelle Stratton is paying
for my services, Julian.

1068
01:45:58,729 --> 01:46:02,809
I think you know this is
a matter of some secrecy.

1069
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:08,449
Tell her not to bother.

1070
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:11,129
Julian, you'll have to help us more.

1071
01:46:14,329 --> 01:46:16,529
You tell Michelle to forget me.

1072
01:46:19,169 --> 01:46:21,969
I'm more worried
about your defence, Julian,

1073
01:46:22,049 --> 01:46:24,730
than about her private life.

1074
01:46:24,809 --> 01:46:28,889
We'll must go into the details
the night of the murder.

1075
01:46:28,969 --> 01:46:31,929
The maid saw you trying to save Leon,

1076
01:46:32,009 --> 01:46:35,329
so the police are only pressing
the Rheiman case.

1077
01:46:35,409 --> 01:46:38,529
The papers and TV
are trying you already.

1078
01:46:38,609 --> 01:46:41,689
The police aren't
investigating any more.

1079
01:46:41,769 --> 01:46:45,289
We need some help, some facts,

1080
01:46:45,369 --> 01:46:48,209
to get the investigation going again.

1081
01:46:48,289 --> 01:46:51,209
Then we can find out
about Leon, Rheiman...

1082
01:46:51,289 --> 01:46:52,809
maybe the blonde boy.

1083
01:46:54,649 --> 01:46:56,410
How about it, Julian?

1084
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:12,449
Lieutenant Curtis?

1085
01:47:12,529 --> 01:47:15,009
Yes, Mrs. Stratton. This is an honour.

1086
01:47:15,089 --> 01:47:16,729
May I sit?

1087
01:47:17,929 --> 01:47:21,209
I was told you wanted to see me.

1088
01:47:21,289 --> 01:47:25,729
I want to talk to you about
the Julian Kay/Rheiman murder case.

1089
01:47:25,809 --> 01:47:27,369
Yes.

1090
01:47:27,449 --> 01:47:29,809
I'm paying
for Mr. Kay's defence.

1091
01:47:30,889 --> 01:47:32,529
I know.

1092
01:47:32,609 --> 01:47:37,129
I'm paying for Mr. Kay's defence
because I know he's not guilty.

1093
01:47:37,209 --> 01:47:39,769
I don't want
an obstruction of justice.

1094
01:47:39,849 --> 01:47:42,369
How do you know he's not guilty?

1095
01:47:42,449 --> 01:47:45,609
Because he wasn't
in Palm Springs that night.

1096
01:47:45,689 --> 01:47:49,009
- No?
- No. He was with me.

1097
01:48:04,409 --> 01:48:07,450
I told them, Julian.

1098
01:48:07,529 --> 01:48:09,889
I heard.

1099
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:14,329
You didn't have to do that, Michelle.

1100
01:48:14,409 --> 01:48:16,609
You could have forgotten me.

1101
01:48:16,689 --> 01:48:18,649
I'd rather die.

1102
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:25,649
What will you do now?

1103
01:48:25,729 --> 01:48:29,569
I don't know. I can't go home.

1104
01:48:29,649 --> 01:48:32,849
The newsmen
are waiting outside for me.

1105
01:48:32,929 --> 01:48:34,889
There's dozens of them.

1106
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:41,009
Why did you do it?

1107
01:48:43,369 --> 01:48:45,609
I had no choice.

1108
01:48:46,769 --> 01:48:48,730
I love you.

1109
01:48:56,329 --> 01:48:58,610
My God, Michelle...

1110
01:49:00,609 --> 01:49:03,929
it's taken me so long
to come to you.
