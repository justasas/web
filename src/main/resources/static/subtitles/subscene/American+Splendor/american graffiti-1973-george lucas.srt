1
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:04,872
Hey, Curt, you guys gonna have
a little bash your last night in town?

2
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:06,415
Moose has been
lookin' for you all day.

3
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:09,377
He got worried. Thought you were
tryin' to avoid him.

4
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,213
What do you got?

5
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:16,884
- Oh, great.
- That's $2,000, man. $2,000!

6
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:20,388
Mr. Jennings gave it to me
to give to you. He's sorry it's late.

7
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:22,974
It's the first scholarship
the Moose Lodge has given out.

8
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:26,477
He says they're all very proud of you
back at the lodge.

9
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,855
- Why don't you hold it for me?
- I don't want it. Take it. It's yours.

10
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,232
I'll take it.

11
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,445
Listen, your sister calls.
I'll talk to you later.

12
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:39,198
- Wait a second. She can wait.
- Make it short and sweet, huh?

13
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:43,619
Listen, I don't think
I'm gonna be going tomorrow.

14
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,665
Come on.
What are you talking about?

15
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:52,586
I was thinkin' I could wait a year,
go to City for a while.

16
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,630
You chicken fink.

17
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:56,715
After all we went through
to get accepted?

18
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,385
We're gettin' out of
this turkey town...

19
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:02,388
and now you wanna crawl
back into your cell?

20
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:09,103
You wanna end up like John?
You just can't stay 17 forever.

21
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:13,107
- Get that through your head!
- I just need some time.

22
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,401
I gotta go talk to Laurie.
Now take it. Take it!

23
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:18,695
We're leaving in the morning,
all right?

24
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,324
We're leaving
in the morning!

25
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:33,961
<i>We gonna rock and roll ourselves
to death, baby!</i>

26
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:36,505
<i>You got the Wolfman Jack Show!</i>

27
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,460
Don't with the thing!

28
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:18,088
Will you stop it
with the Big Bopper stuff?

29
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,340
- Hi, John!
- Not too good, huh?

30
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:24,260
Why is it every girl around here
is ugly or has a boyfriend?

31
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:28,473
Where is the dazzling beauty
I've been searching for all my life?

32
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:32,894
I know what you mean.
The pickings are really gettin' slim.

33
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:34,979
The whole strip is shrinkin'.

34
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:39,400
You know, I remember
about five years ago...

35
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:42,320
it would take a couple of hours
and a tank full of gas...

36
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:44,739
just to make one circuit.

37
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:47,200
It was really somethin'.

38
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:56,459
Hey, John.
Someone new in town.

39
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,295
Are you gonna go after him?

40
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,839
Hey, listen, professor.

41
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:05,301
If he can't find me, then he ain't
even worth racin', right?

42
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:07,637
Big shot.

43
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,847
Well?

44
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,476
Where was I?

45
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:16,521
How you thought
high school romances were goofy...

46
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:19,482
and we started dating only because
you thought I was cute and funny...

47
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,651
but then you suddenly realized...

48
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,611
you were in love with me,
it was serious...

49
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:30,660
You were leadin' up
to somethin' kinda big.

50
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,995
You make it sound like
I'm giving dictation.

51
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:38,334
Well, seriously...

52
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:40,544
what I meant was that...

53
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:43,422
since we do care for each other
so much...

54
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:48,886
and since we should really consider
ourselves as adults now...

55
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,558
Could I have a couple
of those fries?

56
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:58,979
Where was I?

57
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:00,981
- Consider ourselves adults.
- Right, right.

58
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:05,235
I thought,
maybe before I leave...

59
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,404
we could agree that...

60
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:14,703
seeing other people while I'm away
can't possibly hurt, you know?

61
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:25,506
- You mean dating other people?
- It would strengthen our relationship.

62
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:28,759
Then we'd know for sure
that we're really in love.

63
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:30,886
Not that there's any doubt.

64
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:42,105
I think you're right.

65
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,317
I mean, we're not kids anymore...

66
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,986
and it's silly to think
that when we're 3,000 miles apart...

67
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,614
we shouldn't be able
to see other people and go out.

68
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:52,949
Laurie, listen.
I didn't ask for that back.

69
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:56,078
I know. I just sort of think
it's juvenile now.

70
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:58,205
I'll keep it at home.
It's less conspicuous there.

71
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:00,415
- You don't wanna wear it?
- I didn't say that.

72
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:03,126
I understand,
and I'm not upset.

73
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,672
I can't expect you to be a monk
while you're away.

74
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,759
I got a really neat
record collection.

75
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:13,511
I even got "Pledging My Love"
by Johnny Ace.

76
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:16,181
How can you love Nelson when
he's going out with Marilyn Gator?

77
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:19,309
- Since he dumped on you...
- He didn't dump on me, you little dip!

78
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:21,645
Oh, hi, Steve.

79
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,813
Hey, sis.

80
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,946
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

81
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,115
- What is it?
- Nothing!

82
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:40,288
I've decided to let you take care
of my car while I'm away.

83
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,956
At least until Christmas.

84
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,958
I'm comin' back for a couple
of weeks at Christmas.

85
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:48,421
I've got some very simple instructions
for you. Here's the keys.

86
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:52,133
First of all,
only 30-weight Castrol-R.

87
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:55,678
I've written the tire pressure
and stuff on a pad in the glove...

88
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:58,139
- Are you listening?
- Hey, what's wrong?

89
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:02,769
- Are you crying?
- I can't believe it!

90
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:05,813
I don't know what to say!

91
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:09,650
I'll love and protect this car
until death do us part.

92
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:11,861
This is a super fine machine.

93
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,947
This might even be better than
Darryl Starbird's superfleck moon...

94
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:18,993
It is! It's better than
Darryl Starbird's superfleck moonbird.

95
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:20,578
Budda?

96
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:25,041
How'd you like to go
to the drive-in movies with me?

97
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:28,961
- You gotta be kidding.
- Would I kid about a thing like that?

98
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:30,963
I have a new car.

99
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:38,346
Did she do that to you?

100
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,349
Curt, you wanna bomb around?
I wanna try out my new wheels.

101
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:43,351
Well, I'd like to, Toad...

102
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,603
but I'm gonna go
with Steve and Laurie to the hop.

103
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:49,690
- Besides, I'd spoil your luck.
- Yeah, right.

104
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:51,901
Tonight, things are gonna be
different.

105
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:56,030
Wait a minute.
You're goin' to the freshman hop?

106
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:58,407
Come on, man!
That place is for kids.

107
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:01,368
You two just got your ass outta there.
Don't go back there.

108
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:02,995
You ain't got no emotions?

109
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,041
We are going to remember
all of the good times.

110
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:10,044
- Yeah, well, go.
- Why don't you come with us?

111
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:13,339
- Bullshit, man!
- Come on. For old times' sake.

112
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,841
Listen, you go.
Go ahead, Curtsie baby.

113
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:18,927
You go on over there and remember
the good times you won't be havin'.

114
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:21,388
I ain't goin' off to some
goddamn fancy college.

115
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:25,142
I'm stayin' right here...
havin' fun as usual!

116
00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:30,522
Jesus, Milner, you're really
in a great mood tonight!

117
00:09:30,606 --> 00:09:32,983
What's the matter, John?

118
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,906
Did I do somethin' wrong?
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:41,158
Man, it's nothin'.

120
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:46,538
- We'll see you later, okay?
- All right.

121
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:49,833
We'll all do somethin' together
before Steve leaves.

122
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:54,671
Wait a minute.
Now you're not goin'?

123
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:56,631
I don't know.

124
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:43,803
- Hey, Milner!
- What happened to your flathead?

125
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:47,307
- What happened to your flathead?
- Your mother!

126
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:52,478
Your mother!
Hey, we been talkin' 'bout you.

127
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:56,774
There's a very wicked
'55 Chevy lookin' for you.

128
00:10:56,858 --> 00:11:01,070
- Yeah, I know.
- Watch out for the cop at Jerry's.

129
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:02,614
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

130
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:21,007
Hey, Toad!

131
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,885
Is that you
in that beautiful car?

132
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:27,096
Jeez, what a waste
of machinery!

133
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,444
Hey, kid!

134
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:57,835
<i>All right, baby.
Here we go with another call.</i>

135
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:03,215
<i>- Answer the phone, dummy.
- Pinkie's Pizza.</i>

136
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:06,302
<i>You got any more of those
secret agent spy scoops?</i>

137
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:07,803
<i>Hit parade
on a stethoscope?</i>

138
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:10,806
<i>No, secret agent spy scope, man...</i>

139
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,850
<i>that pulls in the moon,
stars, the planets...</i>

140
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,020
<i>and the satellites
and little bitty space men.</i>

141
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,022
<i>You have the wrong number,
partner.</i>

142
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,038
<i>Wait!
What did you say?</i>

143
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,542
Quick. Quick.
Hang a right.

144
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,253
- What? Why?
- Steven, cut over to "G" Street.

145
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:44,715
I just saw a vision.
I saw a goddess.

146
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,216
Come on.
You gotta catch up to her.

147
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,260
- I didn't see anything.
- Come on, Curt.

148
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:51,305
We can't be spendin' half the night
chasing girls down for you.

149
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:56,810
Laurie, this was the most perfect,
dazzling creature I've ever seen!

150
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,312
- She's gone. Forget it.
- She spoke to me.

151
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:03,358
She spoke to me through the window!
I think she said, "I love you."

152
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,903
That means nothing
to you people?

153
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,657
You have no romance,
no soul?

154
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,953
Someone wants me. Someone
roaming the streets wants me.

155
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:17,038
Will you turn the corner?

156
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,629
- Later.
- Alligator.

157
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,310
You're new around here.
Where you from?

158
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:42,939
- Turlock.
- You know a guy named Frank Bartlett?

159
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,275
No. Does he go to Turlock High?

160
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,944
Well, he used to.
He goes to J.C. Now.

161
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,281
- Do you go to J.C.?
- Yeah, sure.

162
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,908
Wow! Do you know Guy Phillips?

163
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:56,244
Yeah, sure.
I got him in a class.

164
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:58,121
He's so boss!

165
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,999
How'd you like to ride around
with me for a while?

166
00:14:01,082 --> 00:14:03,376
I'm sorry. I can't.
I'm going steady.

167
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:08,881
- Come on!
- I just can't.

168
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,842
You're just ridin' around
with a bunch of girls.

169
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:13,928
Anybody else in there
wanna go for a ride?

170
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,933
You got nothin' to fear.
I'm as harmless as a baby kitten.

171
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:23,312
- I'll go! I'll go!
- Judy's sister'll go with you, okay?

172
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:27,024
Yeah, sure.
Judy, her sister, her mother.

173
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:29,026
Anybody.
I'll take 'em all.

174
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,654
Listen. We'll go up
and stop at that light.

175
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,157
It'll turn red by the time we get there.
All right?

176
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,703
If you ever get tired of going steady
with somebody that ain't around...

177
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm up for grabs.

178
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:07,106
So, you're Judy's little...
Shit! How old are you?

179
00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm old enough.
How old are you?

180
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:12,069
- I'm too old for you.
- You can't be that old.

181
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:15,155
I think you better go back
and sit with your sister.

182
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:18,951
Where are they anyway? Are they
comin' back? This is a joke, right?

183
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,704
This better be a joke,
'cause I'm not drivin' you around!

184
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:25,207
You asked me. What's the matter?
Am I too ugly?

185
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:30,254
Judy doesn't want me with her,
and now you don't want me with you.

186
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:34,383
Nobody wants me.
Even my mother and father hate me.

187
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,428
- Everybody hates me.
- They don't hate ya.

188
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:41,265
- You throw me out, I'll scream.
- No, no. Stay cool.

189
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:44,351
Everything's all right.
We'll find your sister.

190
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:48,313
- Can't be too hard to find.
- John, you gonna be there tonight?

191
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,065
Shit! Hey, get down.

192
00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:00,742
- Is this called "copping a feel"?
- What? No! Get up. Jesus.

193
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,412
- What's your name?
- My name?

194
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,747
Mud... if anybody sees you.

195
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:19,719
- What do you got in there, kid?
- More than you can handle.

196
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:49,707
Excuse me.
I think we've had an accident.

197
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,628
Damn it, I won't report you this time,
but next time, just watch it!

198
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:19,237
- Good evening. How are ya?
- Yeah, hi.

199
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,157
This is really a beautiful car,
you know? Of course you know it.

200
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,368
You know what I'd like to give you
for this car?

201
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:27,829
I'd like to give you $ 1,000!

202
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:31,082
I can't give you that, but I'm not gonna
give you a whole line.

203
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:34,252
I'm gonna tell you
what I can give you. Come over here.

204
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:38,256
How would you like, for $525,
to own this practically new 'Vette?

205
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:40,258
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

206
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,970
I'm gonna knock ten percent
right off the top. How about that?

207
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:47,348
- That's $98 down.
- No, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:50,351
$98 a month.
You ask me how can I do this?

209
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,895
I'll tell you
how I can do it.

210
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,773
My boss wants to get rid
of the sporty cars.

211
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:58,901
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

212
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:00,569
I don't think it's a good idea.

213
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,072
- I'm busy.
- I want you to listen.

214
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:05,783
I've gotta go!

215
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:08,244
Leave me alone,
for God's sake!

216
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,958
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

217
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,598
<i>At the hop</i>

218
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:36,188
<i>You can rock it, you can roll it
Do the stomp, even stroll it at the hop</i>

219
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:40,692
<i>When the records start spinnin', you
can mix it with the chicken at the hop</i>

220
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,780
<i>Do the dance sensation
that's sweepin'the nation at the hop</i>

221
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:50,536
<i>Let's go to the hop</i>

222
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,715
<i>You can swing, you can groove it, you
can really start to move it at the hop</i>

223
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:09,388
<i>Where thejockey is the smoothest
And the music is the coolest at the hop</i>

224
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:12,891
<i>All the guys and chicks
can get their kicks at the hop</i>

225
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:28,615
Let's go!

226
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:55,767
Why are you so depressed?

227
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,144
You'll forget him in a week.

228
00:19:58,228 --> 00:20:02,106
After you're elected Senior Queen,
you'll have so many boys after your bod.

229
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,402
Peggy, the point is, I do not want
to go out with any other guys.

230
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:10,990
Laurie, I know
it's a drag, but you can't just...

231
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:14,160
Remember what happened
to Evelyn Chelnick?

232
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:17,497
When Mike went into the Marines,
she had a nervous breakdown...

233
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,625
and was acting so wacky
she got run over by a bus.

234
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,379
I just wish I could
go with him.

235
00:20:24,462 --> 00:20:27,048
Laurie, jeez! Come on.

236
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:32,011
Hey, zit makeup!
Hey, everybody...

237
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:34,472
Just cool it, Steve?

238
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,769
Let me see
some of that stuff.

239
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:41,312
You leavin' tomorrow?

240
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:45,733
- You and Laurie engaged yet?
- No, but we got it all worked out.

241
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:48,319
We're still gonna be goin' together,
but we can date other people.

242
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,780
And screw around.
I know.

243
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:53,199
Hey, I hear college girls
really put out.

244
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:02,917
<i>When I saw her
standing there</i>

245
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,961
<i>I had to pick her up
I couldn't fail</i>

246
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:11,926
<i>'Cause I knew
I had to make her mine</i>

247
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:15,221
<i>She's so cool
She's so fine</i>

248
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:22,937
<i>I was tryin'to think
of words to say</i>

249
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,357
<i>So I went up to her
and changed my fate</i>

250
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:32,112
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?

251
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:35,616
- Let's dance.
- No, thanks.

252
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:42,039
- Laurie, I said I wanna dance.
- Who's stopping you?

253
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:46,460
I thought you might wanna dance with me
our last night together.

254
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:49,171
How sentimental of you.
You'll be back at Christmas.

255
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:52,549
- I want to dance now, not at Christmas.
- Get your cooties off me!

256
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:04,811
- Don't make a scene.
- Go ahead. Slug me. Scar my face!

257
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:07,856
I wouldn't dance with you
if you were the last guy in this gym.

258
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,943
- This is getting good.
- Come on, Eddie, I'll dance with you.

259
00:22:11,026 --> 00:22:13,111
You don't mind, do you, Peggy?

260
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,658
Joe College strikes out.

261
00:23:11,377 --> 00:23:13,963
<i>Feel so good</i>

262
00:23:14,422 --> 00:23:17,008
<i>Take me by my hand</i>

263
00:23:30,855 --> 00:23:34,442
<i>And let's go strollin'</i>

264
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:37,487
<i>In Wonderland</i>

265
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:47,205
Curtis, come here.
Help me, will ya? I'm surrounded.

266
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:50,291
- Come here.
- You won't dance? Come on.

267
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:52,293
No, really, I'd like to,
but I can't.

268
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:55,546
If old Mr. Simpson saw me dancing
with one of you sexy little...

269
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,216
excuse me... one of you young ladies,
he'd have my rear end.

270
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:06,724
Come on, gentlemen, back inside.
Put it out. Let's go.

271
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:10,102
Kids! Want a cigarette?

272
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:13,189
All right.

273
00:24:14,398 --> 00:24:17,610
- I thought you'd left.
- No, not yet. I have no matches.

274
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:20,404
That's all right.

275
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:26,702
Brother! How do I get stuck
with dance supervision?

276
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:28,996
You goin' back east?

277
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,751
I remember the day I went off.
Got drunk as hell the night before.

278
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:36,629
- Blotto.
- Blotto. Exactly.

279
00:24:36,712 --> 00:24:40,924
- Barfed on the train all the next day.
- Cute. Very cute.

280
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:43,052
Where'd you go again?

281
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,179
Middlebury. Vermont.

282
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:48,015
- Got a scholarship.
- Only stayed a semester.

283
00:24:48,098 --> 00:24:50,601
One semester, after all that.
Came back here.

284
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,644
Why'd you come back?

285
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:55,981
Decided I wasn't
the competitive type.

286
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,983
I don't know.
Maybe I was scared.

287
00:25:00,277 --> 00:25:03,530
Well, I think I may find
that I'm not...

288
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:05,908
the competitive type myself.

289
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:11,413
- What do you mean?
- I'm not really sure that I'm going.

290
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:14,708
Now, don't be stupid. Experience life.
Have some fun, Curtis...

291
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,668
Bill?

292
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:21,673
Mr. Wolfe?
Can I speak with you a minute?

293
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:25,886
- Hi, Curt.
- Jane.

294
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:29,681
Good luck, Curtis.

295
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:33,226
Yeah. I'll see ya.

296
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,020
Thanks a lot.

297
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:04,507
<i>A Wolfman Jack exclusive!</i>

298
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:07,135
<i>The Beach Boys, baby.
A brand-new group.</i>

299
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:09,596
<i>I predict they gonna go
a long way.</i>

300
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,890
<i>This is called
"Surfin'Safari."</i>

301
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:15,143
<i>Let's go surfin'now
Everybody's learnin'how</i>

302
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:18,271
<i>Come on and safari with me</i>

303
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:22,525
<i>Early in the mornin'
we'll be startin'out</i>

304
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,612
<i>Some honeys
will be comin'along</i>

305
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:29,365
The next night
we went out with ammunition...

306
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,909
Don't you have some homework
or somethin' to do?

307
00:26:31,993 --> 00:26:33,995
No sweat.
My mother does it.

308
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:36,706
Anyway,
he thought he was had.

309
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,916
He started the car and couldn't see
through the windshield...

310
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,377
and zoomed straight
into the canal.

311
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:44,672
- I still got some... don't try anything.
- Watch it, will ya?

312
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:47,884
Jesus Christ!
Thanks a lot.

313
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:53,806
Hey, drivin' is
a serious business.

314
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,268
I ain't havin' no accidents
just because of you.

315
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:06,444
Come on. Don't give me any grief.
I'm warning ya.

316
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:08,529
Spare me, killer.

317
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:13,326
Oh, shit!

318
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:18,789
- Why did you do that?
- I don't like that surfin' shit.

319
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:23,753
Rock and roll's been goin' downhill
ever since Buddy Holly died.

320
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:26,130
Don't you think
the Beach Boys are boss?

321
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,883
- You would, you grungy little twerp.
- Grungy!

322
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:32,803
You big weenie.
If I had a boyfriend, he'd pound you.

323
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:35,848
Yeah, sure. Shit!

324
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:39,685
- Holstein!
- Good. A cop.

325
00:27:39,768 --> 00:27:42,313
I'm gonna tell him
you tried to rape me.

326
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:45,190
I'm gonna tell him how old I am,
my parents don't know I'm out...

327
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:47,151
and you tried to rape me.

328
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:49,862
- Yeah, with shaving cream.
- Boy, are you up a creek.

329
00:27:49,945 --> 00:27:52,823
Come on. Really, Carol,
don't say anything.

330
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,617
If you say:
"I was a dirty bird.

331
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:57,828
Carol's not grungy.
She's bitchin'."

332
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,998
Say it. I'll tell him.

333
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:09,840
I was a dirty bird.
Carol's not grungy. She's bitchin'.

334
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:11,633
I'll think about it.

335
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,603
- Where you goin', Milner?
- I'm goin' home, sir.

336
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:28,400
- Where've you been?
- We were... At the movies, sir.

337
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:32,195
You didn't happen to be around 12th
and "G" about 8:30 tonight, did you?

338
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,700
No. No, sir.
We were at the movies, like I said.

339
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:42,873
I stopped you because the light
on your license plate's out.

340
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:45,458
I'm gonna have
to cite you for that.

341
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:48,962
And the front end
of this thing you're drivin'...

342
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:50,964
Iooks a little low.

343
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:54,134
No, sir.
It's 121/2 inches, regulation size.

344
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:57,429
It's been checked several times.
You can check it if you like, sir.

345
00:29:00,432 --> 00:29:05,145
Look, Milner. Listen.
You can't fool with the law.

346
00:29:05,228 --> 00:29:07,313
We know that was you tonight.

347
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,274
We have an excellent
description of this car.

348
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:12,777
I could run you in right now,
and I could make it stick.

349
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:14,696
But I'm not gonna do that.
You know why?

350
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:17,824
I want to catch you in the act...

351
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:20,118
and when I do,
I'm gonna nail you but good.

352
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,791
Happy birthday, Milner.

353
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,670
Thank you... asshole.

354
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:32,714
You're a regular J.D.

355
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:36,467
File that under C.S.
Over there.

356
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:38,720
C.S.?
What's that stand for?

357
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:41,889
Chicken shit.
That's what it is.

358
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:19,218
Ain't he neat?

359
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:23,681
You know a guy around here
with a piss-yellow deuce coupe?

360
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:27,017
- Supposed to be hot stuff?
- You mean John Milner?

361
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:29,854
Ain't nobody can beat him, man.
He's got the fastest...

362
00:30:29,937 --> 00:30:33,691
- I ain't nobody, dork. Right?
- Right.

363
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:37,403
You see this Milner,
you tell him I'm lookin' for him, huh?

364
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:40,948
Tell him I aim to blow his ass
right off the road.

365
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:42,950
Ain't he neat?

366
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:02,720
What a babe!
What a bitchin' babe!

367
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:21,780
Hello.

368
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,702
You sure you don't
need a lift somewhere?

369
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:30,914
You know John Milner?
John Milner's a good friend of mine.

370
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:35,877
Did anybody ever tell you that you look
just like Connie Stevens?

371
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,005
- You do. I really mean it.
- For real?

372
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:41,550
Yeah. I met her once
at a Dick Clark road show.

373
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,262
- Yeah? You really think I look like her?
- Yeah, no shit.

374
00:31:45,345 --> 00:31:49,141
I'm sorry. I mean... I mean that
I'm not just feeding you a line.

375
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:52,644
I really think you do.
You look like Connie Stevens.

376
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,355
- What's your name?
- Debbie.

377
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:57,732
I always thought
I look like Sandra Dee.

378
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:03,238
- Well, you look a lot like her too.
- Is this your car?

379
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,198
Yeah. I'm Terry, the...

380
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:11,496
- They usually call me Terry the Tiger.
- It's really tough-lookin'.

381
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:15,667
- What school you go to?
- Dewey. Can it lay rubber?

382
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,462
Yeah, I got a 327 Chevy in it.
It's got six Strombergs.

383
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:23,925
That's bitchin' tuck-and-roll.
I really love the feel of tuck-and-roll.

384
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,010
You do?

385
00:32:26,094 --> 00:32:30,974
Well, come in. I'll let you feel it.
I mean you can touch it if you want.

386
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:33,059
I'll let you feel the upholstery.

387
00:32:33,142 --> 00:32:34,894
Okay.

388
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:51,661
- Peel out.
- What?

389
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:54,414
Peel out.
I just love it when guys peel out.

390
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:06,467
And they came all the way
from Stockton. Let's hear it.

391
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,179
I don't care
if you leave this second.

392
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:15,184
And we wanna thank Darby Langdon,
who did all these neat decorations.

393
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:20,273
Now the next dance
is gonna be a snowball...

394
00:33:20,356 --> 00:33:24,235
and leading it off is last year's
class president, Steve Bolander...

395
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:27,738
and this year's head cheerleader,
Laurie Henderson.

396
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:43,504
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?

397
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:46,131
Steven, please.
Smile or something.

398
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:02,564
Quit pinching!

399
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:05,984
You think I care if you go off?
You think I'm gonna crack up?

400
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:09,613
- Boy, are you conceited!
- I don't know why I ever asked you out.

401
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:13,492
- You didn't. I asked you out.
- What do you mean, you asked me out?

402
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:15,494
Backwards Day.
Remember?

403
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:18,872
If I had waited for you to ask me...
Oh, brother!

404
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:21,667
Even after that, you didn't call me
for two weeks.

405
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:26,171
- I was busy.
- You were scared. Dave Ogler told me.

406
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:29,591
When you did ask me out,
you didn't kiss me for three dates.

407
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:33,220
- Well, I was...
- Scared. Jim Kiler told me.

408
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:36,515
I even asked my father
why you hadn't kissed me.

409
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:39,685
- Your father. Great.
- You know what he said?

410
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:41,853
He said he thought
you were bright enough...

411
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:45,399
and that you'd probably
get around to it after a while.

412
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:47,943
You didn't, of course.
I had to.

413
00:34:49,403 --> 00:34:52,197
Remember the picnic?

414
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,116
Out at the canyon?

415
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,285
Boy! You don't remember
anything, do you?

416
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:00,205
The first one,
up at the lake.

417
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:02,499
That was the first time
you kissed me.

418
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:08,255
I had to practically
throw myself at you.

419
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:09,547
I remember.

420
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,410
What's wrong?

421
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:41,162
Go to hell.

422
00:35:47,835 --> 00:35:50,588
What are you doin',
stealin' hubcaps?

423
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:54,300
- Well, hey, Wendy.
- How've you been?

424
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:56,427
Fine.

425
00:35:56,511 --> 00:36:00,723
- Great. How you been?
- Wait a sec.

426
00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:02,767
Wait a minute!

427
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:05,561
Bobbie Tucker.
She's got her car.

428
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:10,733
- Heard you're going away to school.
- Maybe, maybe.

429
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:14,529
- What?
- Same old Curt.

430
00:36:14,612 --> 00:36:18,741
All the time we were going together,
you never knew what you were doing.

431
00:36:21,786 --> 00:36:25,915
- I gotta go.
- Where ya goin'?

432
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,918
- Nowhere.
- You mind if I come along?

433
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:31,754
- Okay.
- Okay.

434
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,925
<i>Louie, Louie</i>

435
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:39,386
<i>Me gotta go</i>

436
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:44,892
<i>A fine little girl
She's waitin'for me</i>

437
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:48,813
<i>Catch a ship
across the sea</i>

438
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:52,900
<i>Sail the ship all alone</i>

439
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:56,528
<i>Never think
I'll make it home</i>

440
00:37:14,129 --> 00:37:17,674
All right, Bolander, break that up.
You know the rules.

441
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:21,178
You and your girlfriend wanna do that,
go someplace else, huh?

442
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:24,389
Hey, Kroot.
Why don't you go kiss a duck?

443
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:28,018
- What did you say?
- I said go kiss a duck, marble-head.

444
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:31,480
All right, Bolander,
you are suspended.

445
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:34,775
Don't you even come in Monday.
You're out!

446
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,112
I graduated last semester.
Remember?

447
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:00,884
Why don't we go out
to the canal?

448
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,345
What for?

449
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:05,805
Listen, I can get tough
with you too, you know.

450
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:08,099
Hard guy.

451
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:30,080
A double Chubby Chuck, a chili-barb,
two orders of French fries and...

452
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:32,832
- Cherry Coke.
- And two Cherry Cokes.

453
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:36,294
What?

454
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,755
Right. Cool.

455
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:43,051
Hey, Deb.
How's my soft baby?

456
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:45,053
Come on. Beat it, Vic.
I'm not your baby.

457
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:49,599
Come on, honey.
So I never called you back.

458
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:51,643
I been, you know, busy.

459
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:53,603
Yeah, three weeks?

460
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:55,772
Besides, it only took me one night
to realize...

461
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:58,358
if brains were dynamite,
you couldn't blow your nose.

462
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:02,612
Look who's talking. Who's the wimp
you're hangin' out with now? Einstein?

463
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:05,823
Tiger happens to be
very intelligent, unlike you.

464
00:39:05,907 --> 00:39:10,536
I know everything your dirty little mind
is thinking. It shows.

465
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,539
Hey, now, buddy, look.
The lady obviously doesn't want...

466
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:15,833
Look, creep. You want
a knuckle sandwich?

467
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:18,836
No, thanks. I'm waitin'
for a double Chubby Chuck.

468
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,546
Then keep your smart-ass
mouth shut.

469
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,506
I'll call you sometime, Deb.

470
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,260
- Some night when I'm hard up.
- I won't be home.

471
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:30,598
Get out of here.

472
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:34,101
You seem to know
a lot of weird guys.

473
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:37,897
That creep's not a friend of mine.
He's just... horny.

474
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,941
That's why I like you.
You're different.

475
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:44,320
L... I am? I mean,
you really think I'm intelligent?

476
00:39:44,403 --> 00:39:48,115
Yeah. And I bet you're smart enough
to get us some brew.

477
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:54,580
Brew? Oh, liquor.

478
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:00,961
Yeah, this place is
too crowded anyway.

479
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:16,810
What about your hamburgers
and Cokes, sir?

480
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:22,900
Will you speed up?
You're gonna lose her.

481
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:26,820
Cut around him.
Just hang a right at the corner.

482
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,448
Lost her again.

483
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:32,367
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

484
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:34,328
But I'm gonna find out.

485
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,456
I know who she is.

486
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:43,545
Well, come on, Bob.

487
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:46,923
Come on! Who is she?

488
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:50,093
Come on!

489
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:54,014
You know Mr. Beeman?
He owns Hepcat Jewelers?

490
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:57,934
That's his wife.

491
00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:00,103
Get outta here.

492
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:02,981
That's ridiculous.
That girl is young and beautiful.

493
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:06,109
- And married.
- And she was cruising Tenth Street.

494
00:41:06,193 --> 00:41:08,778
You gotta be thinkin'
of someone else.

495
00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:13,241
Did you know that my ex is going
to become a presidential aide?

496
00:41:16,786 --> 00:41:20,206
It's a secret, so don't tell anybody,
but his greatest ambition...

497
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,751
is to shake hands
with President Kennedy.

498
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:28,256
How do you suppose you're gonna
do that, wishy-washy, at J.C.?

499
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,092
Maybe I've grown up.
Maybe I changed my mind.

500
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:34,137
- Doubt it.
- Maybe you don't think you can do it.

501
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,931
- Maybe you oughta shut up.
- Maybe I ought to, but I won't.

502
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:40,018
Maybe you oughta
come into the aft chamber...

503
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:42,562
where we can
discuss this in private.

504
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:49,444
Thanks a lot.

505
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:51,654
Come on, Wendy.

506
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,955
Move over.
I'm not sitting on your lap.

507
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,337
- To the opera, James.
- Drop dead.

508
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,672
Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam
and have a little orgy.

509
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:10,882
You wish!

510
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:14,761
I could pick up some margarine.
We could roll around in it for a while.

511
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:44,415
- I've been silly.
- Yeah?

512
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:46,500
I'm really glad
you're gonna stay.

513
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:53,382
We might even have
a class together.

514
00:42:55,885 --> 00:42:57,094
- Maybe.
- Look.

515
00:42:57,178 --> 00:43:00,055
There's Kip Pullman.
He's so neat.

516
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:03,017
Say somethin' to him
when we go by.

517
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,312
- What do you want me to say?
- Anything. I just wanna meet him.

518
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:09,356
Hey, Kip, buddy.
What's up?

519
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,443
Hey, Henderson, long time no see.
What you been doin'?

520
00:43:12,526 --> 00:43:14,945
Nothin'.

521
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:19,158
I just wanted to tell you
Bobbie here is madly in love with you...

522
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:22,202
and trembles at the sight
of your rippling biceps.

523
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,211
- Out of my car, you...
- Wait a second!

524
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:35,716
I hate you!
Get out of my car!

525
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,510
Temper, temper!

526
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:34,107
Here it is:
One ten-cent Coke with ice.

527
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:38,695
And don't take all day
drinkin' it. Please.

528
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:41,698
Rats! I thought
some of my friends might be here.

529
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:44,826
Probably a couple of weeks
past their bedtime.

530
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:47,036
There's Dee Dee.
I hope she sees me.

531
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,830
Oh, shit. Dee Dee.

532
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:53,126
Hiya, John.

533
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:55,336
- What do you say, Al?
- Not much.

534
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,423
You think if I brought my Mopar
by the shop on Monday...

535
00:44:58,506 --> 00:44:59,841
you could spot-weld
the bumper bracket?

536
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:03,428
Sure, anything. Just come by
before noon, all right?

537
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:07,098
- You met Linda?
- No, no. Hi, Linda.

538
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:10,101
This is my cousin, Carol.

539
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:15,273
I'm baby-sittin'.

540
00:45:15,356 --> 00:45:17,900
- Baby-sitting!
- Jesus! Watch it, will ya?

541
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,613
Been hittin' me all night.
Kids will be kids, you know.

542
00:45:22,697 --> 00:45:26,367
Goddamn it! Why don't you
grow up, for Christ's sake?

543
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,619
We don't get along too well,
you know?

544
00:45:29,912 --> 00:45:32,290
- Been like this all...
- You spastic creep.

545
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:28,804
Hi, cousin.
How's your bod?

546
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,438
<i>Wolfman Top 40 is
Box 1300, Chula Vista.</i>

547
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:41,650
<i>Wolfman sweatshirts
is Wolf Enterprises, Bakersfield.</i>

548
00:46:55,622 --> 00:46:58,125
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, son?

549
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,627
I was wondering...

550
00:47:01,837 --> 00:47:03,964
- Could you give me the time?
- Sure.

551
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:06,258
It's quarter to 12:00.

552
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:08,885
Quarter to 12:00.
Good. Thanks a lot.

553
00:47:14,307 --> 00:47:17,394
Excuse me, sir.
I got a problem.

554
00:47:17,477 --> 00:47:20,355
See, I lost my I.D. In a flood...

555
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:23,358
and I was wondering,
since you're going in there anyway...

556
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,069
could you pick me up
some Old Harper's... hard stuff?

557
00:47:26,152 --> 00:47:28,989
- Would you buy me a bottle?
- Why, certainly.

558
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:32,033
I lost my wife too.

559
00:47:32,117 --> 00:47:33,994
Her name wasn't Idy though...

560
00:47:34,077 --> 00:47:36,621
and it wasn't in a flood,
but I know what you...

561
00:47:36,705 --> 00:47:40,750
Yeah, good. Here's some money.
Old Harper.

562
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:53,096
- Quarter to 12:00.
- Right-o.

563
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:55,223
- Night.
- Night.

564
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:06,025
No, not wine!

565
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:35,221
- Was there an old man in here just now?
- Yeah. Just went out the back.

566
00:48:35,304 --> 00:48:37,181
Want something?

567
00:48:39,976 --> 00:48:41,561
Yeah.

568
00:48:41,644 --> 00:48:44,397
Let me have
a Three Musketeers...

569
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,234
and a ballpoint pen,
one of those combs there...

570
00:48:48,317 --> 00:48:50,152
a pint of Old Harper...

571
00:48:50,236 --> 00:48:53,406
a couple of flashlight batteries
and some beef jerky.

572
00:49:08,671 --> 00:49:10,881
You got an ID for the liquor?

573
00:49:13,008 --> 00:49:14,760
Yeah.

574
00:49:14,844 --> 00:49:17,221
Oh, nuts.
I left it in the car.

575
00:49:17,304 --> 00:49:20,558
Sorry. You'll have to get it before.

576
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:23,686
I also...
I forgot the car.

577
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,447
Did you get it?

578
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:36,782
You got it!

579
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,121
You didn't get it.
Why didn't you get it?

580
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:45,624
I needed some things and
I thought as long as I was in there...

581
00:49:45,707 --> 00:49:49,545
Look, Debbie,
can you loan me a dollar?

582
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:51,630
Are you for real? Come on.

583
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:53,632
Girls don't pay. Guys pay.

584
00:49:53,715 --> 00:49:57,719
See, I've only got a 50,
and he doesn't have change.

585
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:04,810
I can't believe this.
I really cannot believe this.

586
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:07,437
Here.

587
00:50:11,983 --> 00:50:16,696
- Excuse me. Could you...
- Buy you a bottle of booze?

588
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,908
Yeah, I know. You lost your I.D.
What kind do you want?

589
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:23,537
Gee, that's terrific.
Just some Old Harper?

590
00:51:07,288 --> 00:51:09,374
That one over there...
that's Freddy Benson's 'Vette.

591
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:13,461
He had a head-on collision
with a drunk. Boom!

592
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:15,630
Didn't have a chance.

593
00:51:15,713 --> 00:51:18,424
He was a good driver too.

594
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:22,387
It's pretty grim when a guy gets it
and it's not even his own fault.

595
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:24,389
Needs a paint job,
that's for sure.

596
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:26,391
See that over there? That '41?

597
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:29,769
That used to be... believe it or not...
the fastest car in the valley.

598
00:51:29,852 --> 00:51:32,313
I never got a chance
to race Earl, though.

599
00:51:32,396 --> 00:51:37,276
He got his 1955 in about
the hairiest crash we ever had here.

600
00:51:37,042 --> 00:51:38,961
Jesus, you should've seen it.

601
00:51:39,044 --> 00:51:41,880
Eight kids killed
and both drivers.

602
00:51:41,964 --> 00:51:45,592
Board of Education was real impressed,
so they filmed the whole thing.

603
00:51:45,676 --> 00:51:48,470
Now they show it
in driver's education classes.

604
00:51:48,554 --> 00:51:51,306
Probably see it
if you get lucky.

605
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:56,145
Course, pretty tough
when they take somebody with them.

606
00:51:59,231 --> 00:52:02,234
You've never had an accident though.
You told me.

607
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:04,695
Well, I come mighty close.

608
00:52:04,778 --> 00:52:07,364
Almost rolled it
a couple of times.

609
00:52:07,698 --> 00:52:11,452
But I've been just quick enough
to stay out of this graveyard.

610
00:52:14,246 --> 00:52:16,081
Bet you're the fastest.

611
00:52:17,624 --> 00:52:20,544
I've never been beat.
A lot of guys tried.

612
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:25,257
Seems to me there's more guys lately
than there's ever been.

613
00:52:30,262 --> 00:52:33,599
<i>Sneakin'around
with the Wolfman, baby.</i>

614
00:52:36,685 --> 00:52:40,773
<i>This is gonna strike a raw nerve. Mama.
Here's The Platters.</i>

615
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,692
<i>Oh, yes</i>

616
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:47,071
<i>I'm the great pretender</i>

617
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:53,660
<i>Pretending
that I'm doing well</i>

618
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:57,748
<i>My need is such</i>

619
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:01,126
<i>I pretend too much</i>

620
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:05,464
<i>I'm lonely
but no one can tell</i>

621
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:10,803
What are you doin', creep?

622
00:53:12,888 --> 00:53:14,348
Who, me?

623
00:53:16,934 --> 00:53:19,520
No, I'm talkin'
to the other 50 creeps here.

624
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:25,609
You know Gil Gonzales?

625
00:53:28,696 --> 00:53:30,614
No, I don't.

626
00:53:30,698 --> 00:53:33,367
Don't know Gil.
Well, you oughta.

627
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:37,121
He's a friend of ours. That's his car
you got your butt parked on.

628
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:47,047
- Where you goin'?
- Nowhere.

629
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:50,009
You must be goin' someplace.
You left here, didn't ya?

630
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:53,303
Bring him over here.
I want to show him somethin'.

631
00:53:58,142 --> 00:53:59,727
Bend down here.
Look across here. See?

632
00:54:01,645 --> 00:54:03,647
Right across there.
You see?

633
00:54:04,314 --> 00:54:07,735
- I guess so.
- You scratched it, man.

634
00:54:07,818 --> 00:54:10,320
Where do you get off
sittin' on Gil's car, man?

635
00:54:10,404 --> 00:54:12,406
Sorry.

636
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:14,658
It's really not much of a scratch.
I don't think you'd see it.

637
00:54:14,742 --> 00:54:19,830
It ain't the size that's in question
here. It's the principle!

638
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:22,833
Jeez, this is gonna be tough.

639
00:54:26,837 --> 00:54:28,922
What should we do with you?

640
00:54:29,006 --> 00:54:31,592
Tie him to the car
and drag him.

641
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:41,268
You know Toby Juarez?

642
00:54:42,853 --> 00:54:45,189
He's a Pharaoh, isn't he?

643
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:49,985
Sure, we know Toby.

644
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:53,572
We killed him last night.

645
00:54:53,655 --> 00:54:56,617
Tied him to the car
and dragged him.

646
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:04,875
This is gonna take
some thinkin'.

647
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:15,260
You better come with us and maybe
take a ride with the Pharaohs, huh?

648
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:18,263
No, listen, I'd really like to,
but I've gotta...

649
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:22,226
I'd rather...

650
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:24,645
I know just how you feel.

651
00:55:24,728 --> 00:55:27,272
- Shotgun.
- No, I called it.

652
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:29,900
- When?
- Before we picked you up.

653
00:55:29,983 --> 00:55:32,236
You can't call it for the whole night.
I got it now.

654
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,613
Get in the back, punk.

655
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:38,409
Will you get in there?
Jesus!

656
00:56:24,038 --> 00:56:26,832
<i>Rock 'n'roll will stand, man!</i>

657
00:56:26,915 --> 00:56:29,418
<i>Who is this
on the Wolfman telephone?</i>

658
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:31,962
<i>- Hello, it's collect.
- Your name is Collette?</i>

659
00:56:32,046 --> 00:56:35,257
<i>- Yeah, collect call for Wolfman...
- Your name is Collette Call?</i>

660
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:37,801
<i>- Sir, this is the operator.
- Are you French, operator?</i>

661
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:41,180
<i>This is a collect call
for Wolfman Jack.</i>

662
00:56:41,263 --> 00:56:44,350
<i>- I love you, operator.
- Is this Wolfman Jack?</i>

663
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:47,978
<i>- Is Floyd there?
- It's for Wolfman Jack.</i>

664
00:56:48,062 --> 00:56:52,274
I just love listenin' to Wolfman.
My mom won't let me at home.

665
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:55,361
Because he's a Negro.
I think he's terrific.

666
00:56:55,444 --> 00:56:57,404
Do you know that he broadcasts
from a plane...

667
00:56:57,488 --> 00:56:59,907
that flies around in circles
all the time?

668
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,450
Do you believe that?

669
00:57:01,533 --> 00:57:04,203
<i>Floyd, I love you, Floyd.</i>

670
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:06,705
<i>Floyd, is this you, Floyd?</i>

671
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:08,999
<i>Floyd, I cannot look on thee.</i>

672
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:11,835
<i>Love took my hand
and smiling did reply...</i>

673
00:57:11,919 --> 00:57:14,129
<i>"Who made the eyes but I?"</i>

674
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:17,549
<i>Floyd, reach out.
Touch my soul, Floyd!</i>

675
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:19,802
<i>- Your party's ready, sir.
- Hello, Floyd!</i>

676
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,139
You tell her, Wolfman!
He's my man.

677
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,392
When I graduate,
I'm gonna be a Wolfman.

678
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:29,770
- He broadcasts out of Mexico someplace.
- No, he don't.

679
00:57:29,853 --> 00:57:31,939
I've seen the station
outside of town.

680
00:57:33,023 --> 00:57:36,819
That's just a clearing station.
So he can fool the cops.

681
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:41,240
He blasts that thing around the world.
It's against the law, man.

682
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:43,867
- They'll never catch the Wolfman.
- No way.

683
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:49,498
Man, who cut the cheese?

684
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,252
"He who smelt it, dealt it."

685
00:57:54,628 --> 00:57:57,798
There's that bad-ass Chevy again.

686
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:00,217
Look at that snatch
he's got with him.

687
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,512
- He looks like a wimp.
- Probably is.

688
00:58:03,595 --> 00:58:06,181
Wimps get all the snatch.

689
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:13,897
Milner ain't gonna beat that.
His time has come.

690
00:58:13,981 --> 00:58:17,651
He's gettin' old.
He ain't as fast as he used to be.

691
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:22,656
You got two seconds
to get your ass over in your corner.

692
00:58:23,949 --> 00:58:26,076
Don't worry,
I won't rape you.

693
00:58:27,494 --> 00:58:31,540
- You got a bitchin' car.
- Yeah, I know.

694
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:36,754
In fact, your car's so neat,
we're gonna give you our special prize.

695
00:58:36,837 --> 00:58:38,756
You want me to give it to ya?

696
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:41,800
Sweetheart, if the prize is you,
I'm a ready Teddy.

697
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:44,136
Well, get bent, turkey!

698
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,559
Very funny!

699
00:58:50,642 --> 00:58:54,438
What a chop! Ha-ha!
Quit laughing!

700
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:57,232
- Jump out and flatten their tires.
- Wait a minute.

701
00:58:57,316 --> 00:59:01,153
- Just do what I say!
- All right, boss.

702
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:45,591
It's a really beautiful
night tonight.

703
01:00:47,426 --> 01:00:50,346
It's a perfect night
for horseback riding.

704
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:52,639
I was going with a guy
who had horses once.

705
01:00:52,848 --> 01:00:57,686
- Yeah? I had a couple of horses myself.
- Really?

706
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:00,731
I used them for hunting.
I do a lot of hunting.

707
01:01:01,648 --> 01:01:05,402
Deer mostly.
Got a couple of bear last year.

708
01:01:05,486 --> 01:01:09,114
Those were good ponies. Had to
train 'em myself. Took a lot of time.

709
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:12,242
Do you still have 'em?
We can go for a ride.

710
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:16,538
No, no. I had to sell 'em
to get these wheels. And a Jeep.

711
01:01:17,831 --> 01:01:19,583
I got a Jeep pickup
with four-wheel drive.

712
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:21,919
It's got a gun rack.
I use that for hunting mostly.

713
01:01:22,002 --> 01:01:25,255
Why do you kill little animals?
I think that's terrible.

714
01:01:25,339 --> 01:01:27,257
Well, yeah.

715
01:01:27,341 --> 01:01:31,303
I figure with bears, though,
it's me or them.

716
01:01:33,514 --> 01:01:36,433
- I think you're really neat.
- Wait a second.

717
01:01:36,517 --> 01:01:39,687
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

718
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:43,607
I guess maybe it's the booze
or somethin'.

719
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:59,039
- Oh! You pinched me.
- I'm sorry.

720
01:01:59,123 --> 01:02:01,458
Let me get my head
over here.

721
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:03,752
You get up. Okay.

722
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:06,880
My leg, my leg! Watch it.

723
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,305
I just love
tuck-and-roll upholstery.

724
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:21,228
Jesus, it's like
Grand Central Station around here.

725
01:02:21,311 --> 01:02:24,314
- Why don't we go someplace else?
- Come on. They won't come back.

726
01:02:24,398 --> 01:02:26,692
Wait a minute.

727
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:29,820
I got a blanket in the back.
Why don't we go over into the field?

728
01:02:29,903 --> 01:02:31,905
All right. Okay.

729
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:39,538
<i>- How old are you?
- I'm 13. How old are you?</i>

730
01:02:39,621 --> 01:02:43,375
<i>- I'm only 14.
- I love you, Wolfman.</i>

731
01:02:46,253 --> 01:02:50,174
<i>We're gonna do the weather
for the valleys and mountaintops.</i>

732
01:02:50,257 --> 01:02:53,761
<i>It's gonna be hot.
About 200 degrees in Merced.</i>

733
01:02:53,844 --> 01:02:55,888
<i>Four hundred degrees
out in Fresno.</i>

734
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:59,475
<i>And about 500 degrees
up around the valley somewhere.</i>

735
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:02,561
<i>You got
the Wolfman Jack Show!</i>

736
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:21,038
This is terrific.
I love miniature golf.

737
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:23,207
Is that right?

738
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,167
I hate it.

739
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:28,462
I don't play it too often.
What are we doing here?

740
01:03:28,545 --> 01:03:30,506
We're outta gas, man.

741
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:34,051
They don't sell gas here.

742
01:03:34,134 --> 01:03:37,096
I know.
But we're outta money too.

743
01:03:58,158 --> 01:04:00,744
What are you punks doin'?

744
01:04:00,828 --> 01:04:01,829
What's goin' on here?

745
01:04:04,289 --> 01:04:08,168
Hi, Mr. Gordon.
What's up?

746
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:12,256
Henderson?
Curt Henderson?

747
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:14,299
Are you with these punks?

748
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:17,219
These are just
some friends of mine.

749
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:20,931
We're just... You know.

750
01:04:21,015 --> 01:04:24,309
You had me nervous there
for a second, huh?

751
01:04:27,187 --> 01:04:29,606
You didn't leave yet, huh?

752
01:04:31,817 --> 01:04:34,486
No, I'm not...

753
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:37,740
I'm not scheduled to leave
until tomorrow morning.

754
01:04:37,823 --> 01:04:39,366
Tomorrow?

755
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,036
Hank Anderson's inside.
Come in and say good-bye.

756
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:46,498
He brought your name up
at the Moose Hall. You got the check?

757
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:56,175
Hank, look who's here.

758
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:02,765
How are you, Curt?
What a pleasant surprise.

759
01:05:02,848 --> 01:05:07,186
Congratulations, my boy.
We're all proud of you. All of us.

760
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:11,982
The Moose scholarship went
to the right boy... you.

761
01:05:12,066 --> 01:05:14,318
And we're all proud of you.

762
01:05:15,402 --> 01:05:17,363
We're all done out here.

763
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,157
All done?
What's he mean?

764
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,578
He means we're all done
having loads of fun out here.

765
01:05:24,662 --> 01:05:28,123
You can have all the fun you want.
This place is for fun.

766
01:05:28,207 --> 01:05:31,001
Yes, it is.
Thank you. Thank you both.

767
01:05:31,085 --> 01:05:32,336
Good luck, son.

768
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:37,633
Before I say good-bye, I hope
you'll be taking along with you...

769
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:39,843
a little piece of this place.

770
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:41,845
I think I have.

771
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:43,931
Good. Don't forget us.

772
01:05:44,014 --> 01:05:46,642
No, I won't forget you,
and you won't forget me.

773
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:49,144
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye and good luck.

774
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:54,900
- It was nice to meet ya.
- What he said goes for me too.

775
01:05:59,947 --> 01:06:03,492
You just might make it
as a Pharaoh yet, boy.

776
01:06:03,575 --> 01:06:06,704
Someday he'll make
a fine Moose.

777
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,207
What's the matter?

778
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:13,794
The radio's gone.

779
01:06:15,796 --> 01:06:18,465
That means the car is gone!
Come on.

780
01:06:33,313 --> 01:06:36,150
Oh, God! Not the car!

781
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:41,071
Oh, no! Anything!
Not the car!

782
01:07:03,677 --> 01:07:06,138
You know,
it doesn't make sense...

783
01:07:06,221 --> 01:07:09,308
to leave home
to look for home.

784
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:13,228
To give up a life
to find a new life.

785
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:16,565
To say good-bye to friends you love
just to find new friends.

786
01:07:16,648 --> 01:07:20,944
- Wait, could you say that again?
- Something Curt said.

787
01:07:21,028 --> 01:07:24,114
Figures.

788
01:07:24,198 --> 01:07:26,575
You must've talked his ear off
tryin' to get him to stay.

789
01:07:26,658 --> 01:07:30,287
No, Steven. That's not true at all.
I didn't say anything.

790
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:32,873
Curt just said at dinner tonight...

791
01:07:32,956 --> 01:07:36,001
that he didn't see
what the big hurry was.

792
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:39,129
He thought that he ought to stay
and go to J.C. For a while...

793
01:07:39,213 --> 01:07:43,759
and try and figure out
what he wanted to do with his life.

794
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:46,512
- That sounds logical.
- Do you think so?

795
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:49,723
Sure. I think Curt's
probably right, for Curt.

796
01:07:51,308 --> 01:07:53,268
Not for me, though.

797
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:57,439
Laurie, look at me.

798
01:08:02,695 --> 01:08:05,656
You know what I want out of life.

799
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:08,242
And it's just not in this town.

800
01:08:12,663 --> 01:08:15,791
I'm not going with you
to the airport tomorrow.

801
01:08:24,758 --> 01:08:27,469
- No, Steven, don't.
- Come on.

802
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:30,264
It's our last night together
for three months.

803
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:32,224
I know. But we've been
through this before.

804
01:08:32,307 --> 01:08:35,352
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I need something to remember you by.

805
01:08:35,436 --> 01:08:37,855
You don't want me
to forget you, do you?

806
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,399
No.

807
01:08:52,953 --> 01:08:55,205
What's wrong?
You're just sitting there.

808
01:08:55,289 --> 01:08:57,791
- You want to. Go ahead.
- Not like that.

809
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:01,295
If you're not gonna remember me
for anything else, just go ahead.

810
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:03,714
Come on.
You want it and you know it.

811
01:09:03,797 --> 01:09:05,758
Don't be so damn
self-righteous with me...

812
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:08,844
after all that stuff you told me
about watching your brother.

813
01:09:08,927 --> 01:09:11,889
You're disgusting!
Get out of my car!

814
01:09:11,972 --> 01:09:15,267
I told you never
to mention that!

815
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:22,107
So, anyhows, the goat killer...

816
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,109
- Can't we talk about something else?
- No.

817
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:27,613
Whenever he strikes, he leaves
a bloody goat's head next to the victim.

818
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,740
Isn't that creepy?

819
01:09:30,157 --> 01:09:32,826
They thought he went up to Stockton,
but two nights ago...

820
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:36,830
they found the bodies
of Carlie Johnson and Don White...

821
01:09:36,914 --> 01:09:40,250
right here at this canal
all hacked to pieces.

822
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:43,087
Who do you think'll take
the regionals this year?

823
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:45,798
Not only were there bloody
goats' heads all around...

824
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,384
but he had switched parts
of their bodies.

825
01:09:48,467 --> 01:09:54,139
She had on his arms
and he had on her legs and...

826
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:55,974
Wait a second!

827
01:09:57,601 --> 01:09:59,853
Did you hear that?

828
01:09:59,937 --> 01:10:01,980
- Do you think it's the goat killer?
- No!

829
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:06,527
Listen, I'll go for help
and you stay here.

830
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:09,321
No, let's get in this field.

831
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,865
Come on, come on!

832
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:20,124
Maybe if it's the goat killer, he'll get
somebody and we'll see the whole thing.

833
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:22,126
I don't want to see
the whole thing!

834
01:10:23,002 --> 01:10:24,962
I can't see what he's doing.

835
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:27,673
Darn it,
I wish I could see.

836
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:31,969
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna see anything.

837
01:10:32,052 --> 01:10:34,471
Just keep him away from me.
That's all I want.

838
01:10:34,555 --> 01:10:36,473
How do I get into these things?

839
01:10:36,557 --> 01:10:38,100
We're all right up...

840
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:41,729
Debbie?

841
01:10:58,329 --> 01:11:00,372
- Oh, no! Please! Please!
- Terry.

842
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:02,791
- Steve!
- What are you doin' up here?

843
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:04,668
Oh, God, Steve.

844
01:11:04,752 --> 01:11:06,795
Is it safe to come out?

845
01:11:06,879 --> 01:11:09,048
- Where did you go, anyway?
- Over there.

846
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,800
- Let's get outta here.
- Where's my 'rod?

847
01:11:11,884 --> 01:11:13,802
- Your 'rod?
- Yeah.

848
01:11:13,886 --> 01:11:16,805
Did I introduce you?
This is Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve.

849
01:11:18,057 --> 01:11:19,767
Well?

850
01:11:21,352 --> 01:11:23,312
It's in the garage.

851
01:11:23,395 --> 01:11:25,522
I put it in the garage
for safekeeping.

852
01:11:25,606 --> 01:11:28,192
I don't want to take any chances
with it.

853
01:11:28,275 --> 01:11:31,612
It's a good thing too,
because somebody stole our car.

854
01:11:31,695 --> 01:11:35,908
- That's terrible. What kind was it?
- Where's Laurie anyway?

855
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:39,244
- I guess we broke up.
- You broke up? Bull.

856
01:11:43,791 --> 01:11:46,126
Doesn't look like a gearshift knob.
What is it?

857
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:49,672
- Come on, give it back to me.
- What's wrong? You're a tough guy.

858
01:11:49,755 --> 01:11:54,093
Go ahead and cream me.
Break my arm. See if I care.

859
01:12:00,474 --> 01:12:02,559
I was just gonna keep it
for a little while.

860
01:12:02,643 --> 01:12:04,520
You're an ogre, like my father.

861
01:12:04,603 --> 01:12:09,066
He won't let me stay out late,
or play records, or anything.

862
01:12:09,149 --> 01:12:11,068
Your father won't let you
stay out late?

863
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:13,070
No, he's terrible.

864
01:12:13,153 --> 01:12:16,782
Once I was out late at a party.
He called the cops.

865
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:20,869
Can you imagine?
He had the whole police force there.

866
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:24,707
By the way,
where is it that you live, Carol?

867
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,376
Over on Ramona. Why?

868
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:32,297
Oh, no! You thought I'd tell you
where I live?

869
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,509
Not me. Not old Carol.
The night is young.

870
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:38,178
And I'm not hittin' the rack
till I get a little action.

871
01:12:40,431 --> 01:12:41,765
What do you keep lookin' at?

872
01:12:41,849 --> 01:12:43,976
Who's that? You know him?

873
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,646
- He's followin' awful close.
- Grab on to something.

874
01:12:58,866 --> 01:13:01,160
Hey, man, I'm sorry
if I scared ya.

875
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:04,913
You'd have to do a hell of a lot
more than that to scare me.

876
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:08,250
I been lookin' all over for ya.
Didn't nobody tell you?

877
01:13:08,334 --> 01:13:12,087
I can't keep track of all you punks
runnin' around here backwards.

878
01:13:12,171 --> 01:13:14,423
You're supposed to be
the fastest thing in the valley.

879
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:17,426
But that can't be your car.
It must be your mama's car.

880
01:13:17,509 --> 01:13:20,346
I'm sort of embarrassed
to be this close to you.

881
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:23,265
I'm not surprised,
drivin' a field car.

882
01:13:23,349 --> 01:13:25,309
Field car?
What's a field car?

883
01:13:25,392 --> 01:13:29,563
A field car runs through the fields,
drops cow shit all over the place.

884
01:13:29,646 --> 01:13:31,440
That's pretty good.

885
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:34,568
I like the color of your car, man.
What's that supposed to be?

886
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:38,238
A cross between piss yellow
and puke green, ain't it?

887
01:13:38,322 --> 01:13:40,741
You call that a paint job,
but it's pretty ugly.

888
01:13:40,824 --> 01:13:44,953
I'll bet you gotta sneak up on the pumps
just to get a little air in your tires.

889
01:13:45,037 --> 01:13:48,624
At least I don't have to pull over
to the side just to let a funeral go by.

890
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:51,085
Funny. You know what?

891
01:13:51,168 --> 01:13:53,671
Your car's uglier than I am!

892
01:13:53,754 --> 01:13:55,756
That didn't come out right.

893
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,137
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Prove it.

894
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:04,515
Why don't you go out and try
to win yourself a few races?

895
01:14:04,598 --> 01:14:07,309
Then you come on back
and I'll show you a few things.

896
01:14:07,393 --> 01:14:09,770
Race him. You can beat him.

897
01:14:09,853 --> 01:14:12,398
That's a tough-lookin' girl
you got with you, man.

898
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:15,818
Tryin' to pick up
a few extra bucks baby-sittin'?

899
01:14:15,901 --> 01:14:19,947
Doll, come and ride with me...
in about ten years!

900
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:22,241
Leave her out of this.
This is between you and me.

901
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,262
He's really fast, isn't he?

902
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:45,305
Yeah, but he's stupid.

903
01:14:47,975 --> 01:14:50,686
Any of you guys know a blonde
in a white T-Bird?

904
01:14:50,769 --> 01:14:52,688
I know her.
What about it?

905
01:14:52,771 --> 01:14:55,607
I'm tryin' to find out who she is.

906
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,402
She's out of your price range, man.

907
01:14:58,485 --> 01:15:02,114
- My brother's been out with her.
- Price range?

908
01:15:03,574 --> 01:15:05,367
Are you trying to tell me
she's a prost...

909
01:15:05,451 --> 01:15:09,330
That's right, she's a $30 Sheri.
Can you imagine that?

910
01:15:09,413 --> 01:15:12,583
- Thirty bucks for that broad.
- We're thinkin' about different broads.

911
01:15:12,666 --> 01:15:14,251
Watch it. Fuzz ahead.

912
01:15:14,335 --> 01:15:16,879
- Where?
- At Jerry's Cherry.

913
01:15:16,962 --> 01:15:19,256
You can barely see the fender.

914
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,592
Yeah. We oughta do somethin'.

915
01:15:21,675 --> 01:15:25,346
I got an idea.

916
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:27,389
I got a good idea.

917
01:15:28,599 --> 01:15:30,601
I think I'm gonna
go over to Burger City.

918
01:15:30,684 --> 01:15:33,145
Yeah, Laurie's probably over there.

919
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:36,065
You think she's got me
worried about where she is, don't you?

920
01:15:36,148 --> 01:15:38,525
I couldn't care less.

921
01:15:38,609 --> 01:15:40,527
- Want to come along?
- Yeah, I do.

922
01:15:40,611 --> 01:15:42,738
- No.
- Make up your minds.

923
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:46,158
No, thanks.
We got to report the car missing.

924
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:48,744
All right. I'll see ya.

925
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:54,208
Shut up! They'll hear us.

926
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,547
- Listen, Carl...
- Curt.

927
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:06,053
Despite you scratchin' Gil's car,
I like you.

928
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:08,806
And I know what you'd like
more than anything right now.

929
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,518
Like every guy in this town, you got
the same secret dream, right?

930
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,231
You wanna be a Pharaoh.
Go ahead. You can admit it.

931
01:16:17,314 --> 01:16:19,900
But you didn't think
it was possible, did you?

932
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:25,823
Well, tonight...

933
01:16:25,906 --> 01:16:28,867
I'm gonna give you your chance.

934
01:16:50,931 --> 01:16:52,599
Get down.

935
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:55,644
Okay. Now, you got it?

936
01:16:55,728 --> 01:16:59,815
- I'm stayin' here. You're on your own.
- Wait a minute, Joe.

937
01:16:59,898 --> 01:17:03,235
- What if he hears me?
- Listen, listen!

938
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,947
Look at it this way.
You got three choices.

939
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:08,991
One, you chicken out.

940
01:17:09,074 --> 01:17:11,910
In that case, I let Ants tie you
to the car and drag you around a bit.

941
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:13,912
- You don't want that, right?
- No.

942
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:18,083
Two, you foul up
and Holstein hears you, and, well...

943
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,878
- You don't want that, right?
- No, I don't.

944
01:17:20,961 --> 01:17:25,758
Three, you are successful
and you join the Pharaohs...

945
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:29,636
with a car coat and
a blood initiation and all that.

946
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,681
Wait a minute.
What blood initiation?

947
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,582
Why don't we go get your Jeep?

948
01:19:21,665 --> 01:19:24,543
- What are you talking about?
- Your Jeep.

949
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:29,256
The one you sold the hunting ponies for.
The one with the four-wheel drive.

950
01:19:32,885 --> 01:19:34,636
You sure you got
enough slack?

951
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,805
Yeah, no sweat.
Let's get outta here.

952
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,773
Come on, Terry.

953
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:50,194
Stand by for justice!

954
01:20:05,542 --> 01:20:08,420
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

955
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:11,507
<i>Feeling so good
'cause you're 16.</i>

956
01:20:16,637 --> 01:20:19,223
<i>Ooh, you come on
like a dream</i>

957
01:20:19,306 --> 01:20:23,185
<i>Peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine</i>

958
01:20:23,268 --> 01:20:25,062
<i>You're 16</i>

959
01:20:25,145 --> 01:20:28,774
<i>You're beautiful
and you're mine</i>

960
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:32,653
Why are we stopping here?

961
01:20:33,612 --> 01:20:36,407
- Carol.
- What?

962
01:20:40,077 --> 01:20:43,706
I don't think that I can
control myself any longer.

963
01:20:43,789 --> 01:20:47,543
- You can't?
- I've got to have you.

964
01:20:47,626 --> 01:20:49,670
Me?

965
01:20:49,753 --> 01:20:52,089
All night you've been sitting there
and you've been so sexy...

966
01:20:52,172 --> 01:20:55,009
and it's been so hot out here...

967
01:20:55,092 --> 01:20:58,178
and I can't wait any longer.

968
01:20:59,138 --> 01:21:01,056
A lot of that
was an act, you know.

969
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,059
Like my crying.
That was just an act.

970
01:21:04,143 --> 01:21:07,062
It's been building up inside of me
like a volcano all night.

971
01:21:07,146 --> 01:21:11,734
If you told me where you lived,
then I could take you home...

972
01:21:11,817 --> 01:21:14,987
but you won't tell me where you live,
so here we are.

973
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:18,657
I mean, I've got to have you.
It's too late.

974
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:20,284
It's not too late.
It's never too late!

975
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:23,871
231 Ramona. Two-three-one.

976
01:21:23,954 --> 01:21:26,498
I'll show you.
It's easy to find.

977
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,967
Hi, Steve.
Mind if I sit down?

978
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:39,803
No. Have a seat.

979
01:21:39,887 --> 01:21:43,098
Just got five minutes off
and I saw you all alone...

980
01:21:43,182 --> 01:21:45,351
for once.

981
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:48,479
- Where's Laurie?
- I don't know.

982
01:21:48,562 --> 01:21:51,398
I thought you guys'd be together,
this being your last night.

983
01:21:51,482 --> 01:21:53,901
- We broke up.
- What?

984
01:21:53,984 --> 01:21:56,695
- It's no big deal.
- What happened?

985
01:21:56,779 --> 01:21:58,906
Budda, you got an hour left.
Let's get on it.

986
01:21:58,989 --> 01:22:01,825
All right, all right,
you old fart! Relax!

987
01:22:02,993 --> 01:22:04,953
Listen.

988
01:22:05,037 --> 01:22:09,041
I'm off in an hour, and I thought
you'd maybe like to come over.

989
01:22:12,878 --> 01:22:15,422
- I don't know.
- Well, why not?

990
01:22:33,065 --> 01:22:35,609
This time it'd just be for fun.

991
01:22:36,694 --> 01:22:38,570
Okay?

992
01:22:41,824 --> 01:22:43,993
Okay.
I'll see you later, then.

993
01:22:46,245 --> 01:22:48,163
Budda, wait.

994
01:22:49,373 --> 01:22:51,792
Listen, l...

995
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:56,088
I gotta get up early in the morning
and I don't think it'd work out.

996
01:23:17,484 --> 01:23:19,445
I tell you somethin'.

997
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:21,655
That thing jumped about
five feet in the air...

998
01:23:21,739 --> 01:23:23,615
Listen, I still gotta find
that blonde.

999
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,870
Anyway, we'll catch you tomorrow.

1000
01:23:27,953 --> 01:23:29,663
I guess so. I don't know.

1001
01:23:29,747 --> 01:23:31,665
What do you mean,
you guess so?

1002
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:34,626
We don't admit a lot of guys
to the Pharaohs.

1003
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:37,671
We got to steal your car coat,
things like that.

1004
01:23:37,755 --> 01:23:39,673
You gotta
make up your mind.

1005
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,594
Rome wasn't burned
in a night.

1006
01:23:48,015 --> 01:23:50,017
- Let's go!
- I'll see you, boys.

1007
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:21,340
<i>You only got about five minutes
if you want to talk to the Wolfman.</i>

1008
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:25,094
<i>Gonna make all your dreams
come true, baby. Hello!</i>

1009
01:24:25,177 --> 01:24:29,098
<i>Would you dedicate a record
to keep me and my girlfriend together?</i>

1010
01:24:29,181 --> 01:24:32,309
<i>- Are you separated?
- We're havin'a little problem.</i>

1011
01:24:32,393 --> 01:24:35,145
<i>I'll bring you right together.
Hold on a minute, man.</i>

1012
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:41,402
<i>Everything's gonna be
all right now, man, understand?</i>

1013
01:24:41,485 --> 01:24:45,823
<i>I chased the evil spirits away.
Now let me play the record for ya.</i>

1014
01:25:49,094 --> 01:25:51,221
Hey, baby.
What do you say?

1015
01:25:54,433 --> 01:25:57,227
Don't say anything
and we'll get along just fine.

1016
01:26:06,612 --> 01:26:09,281
This is the first time
you've been quiet all night.

1017
01:26:09,365 --> 01:26:11,992
I had fun. Good-bye.

1018
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:14,536
Bye.

1019
01:26:16,622 --> 01:26:20,376
- Do you like me?
- Yeah, I like you. You're all right.

1020
01:26:20,501 --> 01:26:22,252
<i>But I mean do you like me?</i>

1021
01:26:26,632 --> 01:26:28,509
I like you.

1022
01:26:33,097 --> 01:26:35,140
Okay?

1023
01:26:35,849 --> 01:26:38,018
Couldn't I have something
to remember you by?

1024
01:26:54,493 --> 01:26:56,745
- Bye, kid.
- Gee, thanks!

1025
01:26:56,829 --> 01:27:00,457
It's just like a ring or something.
It's like we were going steady.

1026
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:02,835
Wait'll I tell Marcia
and everybody!

1027
01:27:02,918 --> 01:27:06,255
- Don't go overboard with this thing.
- I'll see you around.

1028
01:27:20,436 --> 01:27:23,814
<i>I haven't cried so much.
Tears and everything, man.</i>

1029
01:27:23,897 --> 01:27:27,401
<i>I leaned towards the microphone,
I almost shorted myself out!</i>

1030
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:32,906
- Hold that up.
- You're right about that.

1031
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:36,785
But why should I leave home
to find a home?

1032
01:27:36,869 --> 01:27:40,039
Why should I leave friends that I love
to find new friends?

1033
01:27:40,122 --> 01:27:42,333
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I've heard this already.

1034
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:46,003
Aren't you the one that told me
for eight weeks...

1035
01:27:46,086 --> 01:27:48,297
that you have to leave
the nest sometime?

1036
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,299
I realize that.

1037
01:27:50,382 --> 01:27:52,968
No "realizing."
You've been telling me all summer...

1038
01:27:53,052 --> 01:27:56,472
that it's time to stick your head
out of the sand...

1039
01:27:56,555 --> 01:28:00,267
and take a look at the big,
beautiful world out there somewhere.

1040
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:03,437
Gimme this thing.
I feel like a midwife.

1041
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,522
I may have been wrong,
Curt.

1042
01:28:05,606 --> 01:28:08,025
Wrong, nothing!
You've been telling me for eight weeks.

1043
01:28:08,108 --> 01:28:10,319
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, I know.

1044
01:28:10,402 --> 01:28:12,488
You're just mentally
playing with yourself.

1045
01:28:12,571 --> 01:28:15,449
Just relax and we'll talk about it
at the airport.

1046
01:28:16,784 --> 01:28:18,994
Where're you going?

1047
01:28:19,078 --> 01:28:21,622
It's awfully early in the morning.

1048
01:28:21,705 --> 01:28:24,249
- I have a dental appointment.
- Come on, Curt.

1049
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:27,920
Just relax, will ya?
I'll see you at the airport.

1050
01:28:38,138 --> 01:28:41,934
<i>Some enchanted evening</i>

1051
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:46,063
<i>You will see a stranger</i>

1052
01:28:46,146 --> 01:28:49,483
<i>You will see a stranger</i>

1053
01:28:49,566 --> 01:28:54,029
<i>Across a crowded room</i>

1054
01:28:54,113 --> 01:28:57,408
<i>And suddenly you'll know</i>

1055
01:28:57,491 --> 01:29:00,953
<i>That she is the one</i>

1056
01:29:09,837 --> 01:29:14,508
- He mustn't have been used to drinking.
- No. He likes to drink. He told me so.

1057
01:29:18,262 --> 01:29:21,015
I knew a man once
who got that sick.

1058
01:29:21,098 --> 01:29:24,268
Billy Weber.
That was ten years ago.

1059
01:29:24,351 --> 01:29:29,481
On his hands and knees like that
he looks like a dog, like old Ginger.

1060
01:29:29,565 --> 01:29:32,860
Sicker'n a dog,
that's for sure.

1061
01:29:37,948 --> 01:29:41,160
- Are you all right?
- Oh, rats.

1062
01:29:42,286 --> 01:29:44,538
I feel terrible.

1063
01:29:49,668 --> 01:29:52,421
The car!
Debbie, look!

1064
01:29:52,504 --> 01:29:55,132
Debbie, that's the car!

1065
01:29:55,215 --> 01:29:57,384
Look. It's sitting right here.

1066
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:03,724
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah, sure. This is it.

1067
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:09,646
They must've taken
the keys with 'em.

1068
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:12,483
- Maybe we better go call the police.
- No. Wait a minute.

1069
01:30:12,566 --> 01:30:15,986
I got a better idea.
We'll just steal it back, all right?

1070
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:18,906
You get some wire... about a foot.
We can hot-wire it.

1071
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,803
Took the header plugs off?
Expectin' some action?

1072
01:30:40,886 --> 01:30:43,889
Yeah, I think so.
There's some punk lookin' for me.

1073
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:47,601
Why the hell do they bother?
You've always been number one.

1074
01:30:51,605 --> 01:30:54,358
Been a long time, ain't it?
I'll see you. Thanks.

1075
01:31:13,127 --> 01:31:15,087
Hi, this is my car.

1076
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:19,717
What I mean is,
somebody stole...

1077
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,011
No, I mean, I lost my car, see?

1078
01:31:22,094 --> 01:31:25,264
And I want to thank
you two guys for retur...

1079
01:31:25,347 --> 01:31:28,600
I mean, now listen.
Now, listen, guys.

1080
01:31:28,684 --> 01:31:33,272
I've been sick, and this kind of
activity can really be hard on a guy.

1081
01:31:33,355 --> 01:31:35,566
Easy. Easy.

1082
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:41,030
Stop it! Stop it!

1083
01:31:43,157 --> 01:31:45,659
Help! Police! Help!

1084
01:31:46,535 --> 01:31:48,579
Stop it, you creeps!

1085
01:32:07,264 --> 01:32:10,017
- Go, John!
- Get him!

1086
01:32:13,187 --> 01:32:15,230
Come on, get up!
Come on!

1087
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,153
What the hell's
going on here, Toad?

1088
01:32:21,236 --> 01:32:23,155
Man, are you all right?

1089
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:25,949
Yeah, I'll die soon
and it'll all be over, John.

1090
01:32:26,033 --> 01:32:28,535
Wow, you're just
like the Lone Ranger!

1091
01:32:29,286 --> 01:32:31,914
Listen...
Are you with him?

1092
01:32:31,997 --> 01:32:34,458
You're talking
to the woman I love.

1093
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:36,460
What happened, man?

1094
01:32:47,304 --> 01:32:49,556
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi, Judy. Hi, Karen.

1095
01:32:49,723 --> 01:32:51,558
Where's Laurie?

1096
01:32:53,936 --> 01:32:55,979
We know where she is.

1097
01:32:56,063 --> 01:32:57,981
So what?

1098
01:32:58,065 --> 01:32:59,400
So nothing.

1099
01:32:59,483 --> 01:33:02,111
It's just that she was
with a really cute guy...

1100
01:33:02,194 --> 01:33:04,321
in a really boss car.

1101
01:33:04,405 --> 01:33:07,282
And we thought you just
might know who it was.

1102
01:33:08,617 --> 01:33:11,537
- I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know.
- We know.

1103
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:13,622
His name's Bob Falfa.

1104
01:33:24,091 --> 01:33:26,427
Bring two cherry Cokes
with lots of ice.

1105
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:29,221
No, never mind.
Just bring the ice. Pronto.

1106
01:33:29,304 --> 01:33:31,015
Out! Out!
Get out of the car.

1107
01:33:31,098 --> 01:33:33,225
Steve, what are you doin'?

1108
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:35,769
Just get out and shut up.
You too. Get out. Get out!

1109
01:33:35,853 --> 01:33:38,939
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

1110
01:33:47,072 --> 01:33:48,991
I can't believe it.

1111
01:33:49,074 --> 01:33:51,368
You practically get killed
trying to get your car back...

1112
01:33:51,452 --> 01:33:53,329
then you let him have it.

1113
01:33:53,412 --> 01:33:55,873
It's not my car.

1114
01:33:55,956 --> 01:33:58,167
What?

1115
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,127
It is not my car.

1116
01:34:01,503 --> 01:34:03,547
<i>Well, then,
where is your car?</i>

1117
01:34:05,341 --> 01:34:07,343
I don't have a car.

1118
01:34:07,426 --> 01:34:10,554
What about your Jeep?

1119
01:34:10,637 --> 01:34:13,682
How am I gonna get home?

1120
01:34:18,645 --> 01:34:21,815
Where's your car?
I have to hang 'em on a car.

1121
01:34:22,858 --> 01:34:24,652
I need a ride.

1122
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:31,659
Toad, what happened to you?
Did you lose your car again?

1123
01:34:31,742 --> 01:34:33,994
No, Steve took it.

1124
01:34:36,205 --> 01:34:38,457
I want to go to sleep.

1125
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:41,251
<i>You got to take it easy
when you drive that car of yours.</i>

1126
01:34:41,335 --> 01:34:43,796
<i>You've got to cruise easy,
baby.</i>

1127
01:34:43,879 --> 01:34:47,591
<i>Don't be doin'any accidents
or anything on me now.</i>

1128
01:34:47,675 --> 01:34:49,843
You know, Terry?

1129
01:34:49,927 --> 01:34:51,970
I had a pretty good time tonight.

1130
01:34:52,054 --> 01:34:55,099
- Come on. You're just...
- No, no. Really, really.

1131
01:34:55,182 --> 01:34:57,351
I really had a good time.

1132
01:34:57,434 --> 01:35:00,771
I mean, you picked me up
and we got some hard stuff...

1133
01:35:00,854 --> 01:35:04,108
saw a holdup
and then we went to the canal.

1134
01:35:04,191 --> 01:35:06,485
You got your car stolen.

1135
01:35:06,568 --> 01:35:09,321
And then I got to watch you
get sick.

1136
01:35:09,405 --> 01:35:12,700
Then you got
in this really bitchin' fight.

1137
01:35:12,783 --> 01:35:16,286
I really had a good time.

1138
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:19,957
Well, I guess I have a pretty good time
just about every night.

1139
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,501
If I'm not doing
anything tomorrow...

1140
01:35:22,584 --> 01:35:25,629
why don't you give me
a call, okay?

1141
01:35:25,713 --> 01:35:27,631
Yeah, all right.

1142
01:35:27,715 --> 01:35:30,634
I got a little Vespa I play around with.
Maybe, you know...

1143
01:35:30,718 --> 01:35:33,345
Really?
Well, that's almost a motorcycle...

1144
01:35:33,429 --> 01:35:36,306
<i>and I just love motorcycles.</i>

1145
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:38,809
You do?
Why didn't you say something earlier?

1146
01:35:38,892 --> 01:35:40,811
We wouldn't have had
to go through all the fun.

1147
01:35:42,396 --> 01:35:43,731
I gotta go.

1148
01:35:48,402 --> 01:35:50,654
- Good night.
- See ya.

1149
01:36:54,635 --> 01:36:56,845
Hey, what do you want?

1150
01:36:56,929 --> 01:36:59,807
Push the red switch down.

1151
01:37:03,894 --> 01:37:05,813
I'm looking for this girl.

1152
01:37:05,896 --> 01:37:08,273
Yeah. Aren't we all?

1153
01:37:08,357 --> 01:37:10,275
She's not here.

1154
01:37:10,359 --> 01:37:13,612
Come on in the back.

1155
01:37:13,696 --> 01:37:17,032
You just go around the back.
This way.

1156
01:37:29,169 --> 01:37:32,131
Have a popsicle. The icebox just
broke down and they're melting.

1157
01:37:32,214 --> 01:37:34,216
- You want one?
- No, no, thanks.

1158
01:37:34,299 --> 01:37:37,219
- Listen...
- Have a popsicle.

1159
01:37:37,302 --> 01:37:39,179
Are you the Wolfman?

1160
01:37:40,597 --> 01:37:42,474
No, man.
I'm not the Wolfman.

1161
01:37:45,644 --> 01:37:47,521
Wait a minute.

1162
01:37:55,988 --> 01:37:58,782
Who is this
on the Wolfman's telephone?

1163
01:38:00,159 --> 01:38:02,578
That's the Wolfman.

1164
01:38:02,661 --> 01:38:04,121
He's on tape.

1165
01:38:05,164 --> 01:38:06,623
The man is on tape.

1166
01:38:09,293 --> 01:38:11,795
Where is he now?
I mean, where does he work?

1167
01:38:12,838 --> 01:38:15,007
The Wolfman is everywhere.

1168
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:19,928
I gotta give him this note.
Shit!

1169
01:38:23,432 --> 01:38:25,559
Here, let me see the note.

1170
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:33,817
Hell, that's just a dedication, man.
What I can do is relay it.

1171
01:38:33,901 --> 01:38:38,238
- It'll be on tomorrow or Tuesday.
- No, no, this is very important.

1172
01:38:38,322 --> 01:38:41,408
I may be leaving town
tomorrow and it's very important...

1173
01:38:41,492 --> 01:38:45,579
that I reach this girl right now.

1174
01:38:45,663 --> 01:38:48,832
You don't know whether
you're going to leave town or not?

1175
01:38:49,667 --> 01:38:52,586
I'm supposed to go to college
back east tomorrow.

1176
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:56,215
And I don't know
if I'm going to go. I don't know.

1177
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,260
Wait a minute.
Have a popsicle.

1178
01:39:00,344 --> 01:39:02,471
- No, thanks.
- Sit down a minute.

1179
01:39:02,554 --> 01:39:05,808
- It's early in the morning.
- Damn.

1180
01:39:07,059 --> 01:39:08,977
I can't talk
for the Wolfman...

1181
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:11,397
but I can tell you one thing.

1182
01:39:13,232 --> 01:39:16,276
If the Wolfman was here,
he'd say, "Get your ass in gear."

1183
01:39:18,028 --> 01:39:20,114
The Wolfman comes in here
occasionally...

1184
01:39:20,197 --> 01:39:23,534
bringing tapes, you know,
to check up on me and whatnot.

1185
01:39:23,617 --> 01:39:26,286
And the places he talks about
that he's been...

1186
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:28,288
the things he's seen.

1187
01:39:28,372 --> 01:39:31,542
It's a great big beautiful world
out there.

1188
01:39:31,625 --> 01:39:34,461
And here I sit...

1189
01:39:34,545 --> 01:39:37,715
sucking on popsicles.

1190
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,508
Why don't you leave?

1191
01:39:39,591 --> 01:39:41,468
I'm not a young man anymore.

1192
01:39:43,429 --> 01:39:47,349
The Wolfman gave me my start
in the business, and I like it.

1193
01:39:47,433 --> 01:39:49,893
I tell you what.

1194
01:39:49,977 --> 01:39:52,521
If I can possibly do it tonight...

1195
01:39:52,604 --> 01:39:55,232
I'll try to relay
this dedication in...

1196
01:39:55,316 --> 01:39:57,693
and get it on the air
for you later on.

1197
01:39:57,776 --> 01:40:01,947
That would be terrific.
Really. Thanks.

1198
01:40:02,031 --> 01:40:03,866
Just a minute.

1199
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:08,996
- It's been a pleasure, really.
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

1200
01:40:09,079 --> 01:40:11,707
Sticky little mothers, ain't they?

1201
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:13,709
Six or seven of them, right?

1202
01:40:13,792 --> 01:40:16,628
I know. I got a whole
refrigerator full.

1203
01:40:16,712 --> 01:40:19,089
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- See you later.

1204
01:40:26,889 --> 01:40:29,808
<i>Rock on, baby.
We gonna do it right here.</i>

1205
01:40:29,892 --> 01:40:32,019
<i>Rock 'n'roll
yourself to death.</i>

1206
01:40:32,102 --> 01:40:34,229
<i>Oh, mercy!</i>

1207
01:40:34,313 --> 01:40:36,940
<i>Give me some more!
My, my.</i>

1208
01:40:50,996 --> 01:40:53,165
John, let me go with you.
Come on.

1209
01:40:55,626 --> 01:40:58,379
Nah, man, I can't take you
when I'm racin' somebody.

1210
01:40:58,462 --> 01:41:01,924
Just let me go. I just want to watch.
Or I'll flag you, okay?

1211
01:41:02,007 --> 01:41:03,676
All right. Go ahead.

1212
01:41:08,013 --> 01:41:10,349
Paradise Road.

1213
01:41:15,062 --> 01:41:17,564
Where's this Paradise Road?

1214
01:41:17,648 --> 01:41:21,026
Just follow this street
straight out of town.

1215
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:25,572
If you're going to race John Milner,
let me out when we get there.

1216
01:41:25,656 --> 01:41:29,910
Why don't you shut up, baby?
You ain't said one word all night long.

1217
01:41:29,994 --> 01:41:31,745
You're a weird broad.

1218
01:41:31,829 --> 01:41:34,707
But you're gonna
appreciate me soon.

1219
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:38,460
You'll be hanging on for mercy
when I get this sucker rollin'.

1220
01:41:49,096 --> 01:41:51,015
Headin' out to Paradise Road?

1221
01:41:51,098 --> 01:41:53,058
Paradise Road?

1222
01:41:53,142 --> 01:41:55,853
Some guy named Falfa's
goin' up against Milner.

1223
01:41:55,936 --> 01:41:58,230
- He's racing Falfa?
- Yeah.

1224
01:41:58,314 --> 01:42:02,818
Figured something's up. Saw 'em head
out of town real cautious-like and...

1225
01:42:10,409 --> 01:42:13,537
<i>I got a dedication here
for a friend of the old Wolfman.</i>

1226
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,831
<i>He wants me to play
the next song...</i>

1227
01:42:15,914 --> 01:42:18,917
<i>for a blonde young lady
in a Thunderbird.</i>

1228
01:42:19,001 --> 01:42:21,503
<i>A white T-Bird,
you understand.</i>

1229
01:42:21,587 --> 01:42:25,007
<i>My friend's name is Curt
and he wants to talk to you, baby.</i>

1230
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,509
<i>So you meet him at Burger City...</i>

1231
01:42:27,593 --> 01:42:30,679
<i>or you can phone
Diamond-3132.</i>

1232
01:42:30,763 --> 01:42:32,681
<i>He's a friend of mine, you hear?</i>

1233
01:42:32,765 --> 01:42:36,935
<i>Little girl, you better call him
or the Wolfman gonna get ya.</i>

1234
01:43:05,089 --> 01:43:07,925
Laurie, what in the hell
are you doing in there?

1235
01:43:08,008 --> 01:43:11,261
- Is she gonna ride with you?
- Mind your own business, John.

1236
01:43:11,345 --> 01:43:15,265
Yeah, she's going with me.
You take care of yourself, man.

1237
01:43:15,349 --> 01:43:17,559
You guys ready?

1238
01:44:06,775 --> 01:44:09,111
You son of a bitch!

1239
01:44:21,915 --> 01:44:23,834
Come on, she's gonna blow.

1240
01:44:23,917 --> 01:44:26,920
I don't know.
Please, don't come near me.

1241
01:44:27,004 --> 01:44:28,881
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, Steven.

1242
01:44:35,846 --> 01:44:39,058
Oh, Steven!
Please don't leave me.

1243
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:41,143
- Don't leave me, please.
- I won't.

1244
01:44:41,226 --> 01:44:43,395
I couldn't bear it.
Please.

1245
01:44:43,479 --> 01:44:45,397
I'm not gonna leave you.

1246
01:44:45,481 --> 01:44:47,566
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Promise me.

1247
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:49,401
- I promise.
- Do you?

1248
01:44:51,695 --> 01:44:53,447
I'm not gonna leave you.

1249
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:09,254
That was beautiful, John.
Just beautiful.

1250
01:45:10,673 --> 01:45:14,468
- I was losin', man.
- What?

1251
01:45:16,512 --> 01:45:19,765
He was pulling away from me
just before he crashed.

1252
01:45:19,848 --> 01:45:24,103
You're crazy! You creamed him
from right off the line.

1253
01:45:24,186 --> 01:45:27,106
Shit, Toad! The man had me.
He was beatin' me.

1254
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:29,608
John, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1255
01:45:29,692 --> 01:45:32,111
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1256
01:45:32,194 --> 01:45:35,239
He might as well get a wheelchair
and roll himself home.

1257
01:45:35,322 --> 01:45:37,741
Man, you got the bitchinest car
in the valley.

1258
01:45:37,825 --> 01:45:40,744
You'll always be number one.
You're the greatest.

1259
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:48,711
Look at your glasses, man.

1260
01:45:50,462 --> 01:45:53,090
Okay, Toad.

1261
01:45:53,173 --> 01:45:55,551
We'll take 'em all.

1262
01:45:55,634 --> 01:45:58,429
- All right.
- We'll take 'em.

1263
01:45:58,512 --> 01:46:00,681
Let's get out of here.

1264
01:46:00,764 --> 01:46:02,683
Jesus, what a night!

1265
01:46:41,764 --> 01:46:44,850
<i>- Curt?
- Yes! Yes. This is Curt.</i>

1266
01:46:44,933 --> 01:46:48,854
<i>- Who are you?
- Who were you expecting?</i>

1267
01:46:48,937 --> 01:46:51,982
<i>- Do you drive a white T-Bird?
- A white '56.</i>

1268
01:46:52,066 --> 01:46:54,026
<i>I saw you on Third Street.</i>

1269
01:46:56,403 --> 01:46:57,655
Who are you?
Do you know me?

1270
01:46:57,738 --> 01:46:59,573
<i>Of course!</i>

1271
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:03,077
<i>- How do you know me?
- It's not important.</i>

1272
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,913
It's important!
It's important to me.

1273
01:47:05,996 --> 01:47:09,166
You're the most beautiful, exciting
thing I've ever seen in my life...

1274
01:47:09,249 --> 01:47:11,502
and I don't know anything
about you.

1275
01:47:11,585 --> 01:47:14,630
Listen, listen...

1276
01:47:14,713 --> 01:47:18,008
<i>- Could we meet someplace?
- I cruise Third Street.</i>

1277
01:47:18,092 --> 01:47:20,511
<i>Maybe I'll see you tonight.</i>

1278
01:47:20,594 --> 01:47:22,680
No, I don't think so.

1279
01:47:23,681 --> 01:47:25,933
Tell me your name!
At least tell me your name!

1280
01:47:26,016 --> 01:47:28,435
<i>- Good-bye, Curt.
- Wait a minute!</i>

1281
01:47:31,105 --> 01:47:34,024
<i>Little kiss on your ear.
Good night, sweetheart.</i>

1282
01:47:34,108 --> 01:47:36,276
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

1283
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:38,904
<i>Oh, The Spaniels.</i>

1284
01:47:46,787 --> 01:47:49,832
Good-bye, son.
Call us when you get there.

1285
01:47:54,294 --> 01:47:56,380
I'll miss you.

1286
01:48:00,634 --> 01:48:02,553
Good luck.

1287
01:48:02,636 --> 01:48:04,888
Same to you.

1288
01:48:04,972 --> 01:48:07,683
- Am I gonna see you there next year?
- I'll be there.

1289
01:48:14,523 --> 01:48:16,608
Bye-bye, Curt.

1290
01:48:23,407 --> 01:48:25,200
Stay cool, man.

1291
01:48:27,036 --> 01:48:29,330
And don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

1292
01:48:30,205 --> 01:48:31,874
I'll see you, buddy.

1293
01:48:34,335 --> 01:48:38,589
You probably think you're a big shot
going off like this.

1294
01:48:39,798 --> 01:48:41,925
But you're still a punk.

1295
01:48:42,009 --> 01:48:44,261
Okay, John.

1296
01:48:45,262 --> 01:48:47,973
- So long.
- So long!

1297
01:48:53,979 --> 01:48:55,689
Have a good trip.
