2
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,730
Clara was my babysitter.

3
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,360
I was only 12 years old,
naive and somewhat trusting.

4
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,610
But all that was about to change.

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,030
Some babysitters take you to the movies,

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,740
or roller-blading in the park.

7
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,450
Mine brought me on a date with
a serial killer.

8
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,990
Patrick Bateman.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,830
Not my idea of a romantic evening.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,540
God, look at her.

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,750
All drugged up and tied to a chair.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,210
I knew we should have gone to the movies.

13
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,220
At first, I was scared.

14
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,760
I wanted to get out of there
as fast as I could.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,680
But then...

16
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,770
something came over me.

17
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,810
As soon as I was free,
I got really pissed.

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,100
He was about to make a real
mess of my babysitter.

19
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,490
So, I did what many of you would have done,

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,490
I took matters into my own hands.

21
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,200
And it changed my life forever.

22
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,280
Is everything all right in there?

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,370
-I thought I heard a crash.
-Yes, everything's fine. Thanks.

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,710
They found Bateman and his final
victim a few days later.

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,420
The FBI quickly uncovered a psychopath,

26
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,500
and a few extra unsolved murders,

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,260
and he became an instant celebrity,
an overnight sensation.

28
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,130
They even wrote a book about him.

29
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,470
Only in America. As for me?

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,890
I was never tied to the scene.

31
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,520
And rather than self-destruct,

32
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,350
or spend the rest of my life
on some shrink's couch,

33
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,650
I told no one of what had happened.

34
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,650
I silently vowed to devote my life

35
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,610
to stopping other psycho killers.

36
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,700
I couldn't wait to grow up.

37
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,930
The next six years of my life were a blur.

38
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,100
My parents wrote me off emotionally.

39
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,100
My mom became a raging alcoholic,

40
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,730
and my dad was busy fucking the secretary.

41
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,310
Pretty cliché, huh?

42
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,450
So, here I am today,

43
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,620
attending the most renowned behavioral
studies program in the nation.

44
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,120
Here they focus on profiling,

45
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,670
the art, craft and science of
tracking serial killers.

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,010
The subject matter itself attracts some weirdos.

47
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,880
Hey, Rachael.

48
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,390
But then again, maybe it's just me...

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,970
The problem is,
I don't have time for games.

50
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,390
I have got to focus on my work.

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,350
-You can do better than that.
-That's what your mama said.

52
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,270
And what can I say?

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
Studying murder often brings
out the best in people.

54
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,650
Thought you quit!

55
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,410
Getting into West Washington wasn't easy.

56
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,160
I busted my ass in high school

57
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,370
and maintained a perfect
4.0 grade point average.

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,540
All this, so I could study with
the best mind in the field,

59
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,590
Professor Robert Starkman.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,800
Possibly the most revered
hunter of serial killers

61
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,800
the FBI ever produced.

62
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,140
After solving every high profile
crime ever thrown at him,

63
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,020
he suddenly made a startling life
change and became a teacher.

64
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,100
Some say it was his last case,

65
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,730
the mysterious death of serial
killer Patrick Bateman.

66
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,060
Good morning.

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,150
Funny how life works, isn't it?

68
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,190
Good morning.

69
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,280
Starkman never discusses the Bateman case...

70
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,860
Never.

71
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,620
Congratulations on getting through
the first half of the semester...

72
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,370
alive.

73
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,330
I have here...

74
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,290
the official application form

75
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,210
for the teacher's assistant
position for next year.

76
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,280
This is my golden ticket to Quantico,

77
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,330
the FBI's elite training program.

78
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,830
Unfortunately, everyone else is
here for the same reason.

79
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,670
They know that nine out of
Starkman's last 10 assistants,

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,420
-were accepted into the FBI.
-...Announcing my new assistant

81
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,340
by the end of the week, just before
we head off for Spring Break.

82
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,720
And, talking about Spring Break,

83
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,230
don't forget the party at the Dean's mansion.

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,100
We will have the opportunity to
say goodbye to Miss McGuire

85
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,810
who's leaving us for bigger
and better things.

86
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,240
Well, after weeks of grueling,
if not gruesome work,

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,490
let's have some fun, shall we?

88
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,410
Today we will be looking
at the unique aliases

89
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,330
the FBI, the press and the general public

90
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,870
have nicknamed serial killers, and why.

91
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,210
His present TA is Elizabeth McGuire.

92
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,090
She's already been accepted to Quantico...

93
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,170
Early admissions.

94
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,970
I am the front runner to replace her.

95
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,760
Nobody comes close to my rock solid GPA.

96
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,930
Dr. H.H. Holmes was once vilified,
in a biography,

97
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,640
as the "Arch Fiend."

98
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,060
I'd like to say none of them have a chance,

99
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,810
but grades aren't everything.

100
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,320
And I do have some competition.

101
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,070
Contender number one: Brian Leads.

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,950
A GPA as low as his wouldn't
normally pose a threat.

103
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,700
But his family's fortune,

104
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,210
easily numbering in hundreds of millions,
can open a lot of doors.

105
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,000
How do you think he got into the school?

106
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,090
Can you spell "donation"?

107
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,210
He can't.

108
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,880
Albert Fish, AKA "The Moon Maniac"...

109
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,590
AKA "The Werewolf of Wisteria."

110
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,140
Contender two: Cassandra Blaire.

111
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,310
They say she and Starkman
have been going at it

112
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,310
since the beginning of the semester.

113
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,020
But my guess: No way.

114
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,270
He's old enough to be her grandfather.

115
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
Nannie Doss...

116
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,490
"The Black Widow" who murdered
four of her husbands.

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,910
Contender three: Keith Lawson.

118
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,080
He poses the biggest threat of the three.

119
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,120
He and I have been sparring
all year in this class.

120
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,830
But, I have yet to lose a single round.

121
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,000
The fact is, none of them have a chance.

122
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,190
Oh, Bobby.

123
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,360
Red lips, red leaves fall
on my knees like autumn

124
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,080
I miss cigarettes every
single day of my life

125
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,240
When you make love to me

126
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,870
I close my eyes and pray you say goodbye

127
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,870
Damn

128
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,500
She's dawning on me

129
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:47,180
She's beautiful

130
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,350
And I bet you don't know what love means

131
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,190
It's just that you do not love me.

132
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,110
The application is a mere formality.

133
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,240
Come Friday, I will be
Starkman's new teaching assistant.

134
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,400
The position is mine.

135
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,120
I deserve it and I am going to get it.

136
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,080
Yes, there may be a few more
hoops I have to jump through,

137
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,160
but I can handle them.

138
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,170
Besides, failure is not an option.

139
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,050
Why don't we just start over here,

140
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,630
because I suggest you reconsider
your position on this.

141
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,050
I am sorry, Mr. Leads.
I can't make any exceptions.

142
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,470
Your GPA is simply not high enough.

143
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,270
Are you saying no to me?
Do you know who my father is?

144
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,350
Mr. Leads...

145
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,190
I am well aware of your family's legacy.

146
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,400
Heed my advice. A bird in the
hand is worth two in the bush.

147
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,490
That's your fucking advice?

148
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,610
I have some advice for you.
Get ready to take a long vacation.

149
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,950
Go with God, dear heart. Next!

150
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,700
Can you believe this shit?

151
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,790
Wait till she sees my GPA after
my cousin hacks into their mainframe.

152
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,830
Oh!

153
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,000
Do they give these things
up for bitch of the month?

154
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,500
That hag could be the reigning champion.

155
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,720
She's lucky I don't bash her brains in.

156
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,260
Next!

157
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,430
Hi.

158
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,980
I was told to drop off my application here.

159
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,610
Looks like everything's in order here.

160
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,070
Thank you.

161
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,320
Wait a second.

162
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,070
-What's this?
-What?

163
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,570
It says here that you're a freshman.

164
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,990
Yeah, so what?

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
We don't usually allow freshmen or
sophomores to become TAs.

166
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,910
You have to be a junior or above.

167
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,630
This isn't your usual situation.

168
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,460
Professor Starkman told me I could apply.

169
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,800
Shouldn't this decision be
left up to the professor?

170
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,170
Afraid not.

171
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,300
I will run this up the flagpole
and see who salutes.

172
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,770
I will have to speak with your teacher.

173
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,940
I have a schedule to keep.
It's all worked out.

174
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,600
We do this for your own good.

175
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,980
Freshmen can be extremely
overwhelmed, being at college,

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,110
and away from home for the
first time in their lives.

177
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,360
Here, take this.

178
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,990
"Beat common freshmen fears
in 10 easy steps."

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,120
So many new experiences.

180
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,500
It's so exciting.

181
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,920
Look, the only experience I want

182
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,630
is to be Professor Starkman's
TA next semester.

183
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,880
Afraid not! It just wouldn't be right.

184
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,300
I am sure he will put in a good
word for you,

185
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,060
but I don't see how I can make any
exceptions at this point

186
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,600
without setting a dangerous
precedent in school policy.

187
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,600
I will be informing the Dean
of the situation.

188
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,320
I am sorry, Miss Newman.
You will just have to wait.

189
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,850
Have a nice day.

190
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,890
Hmm.

191
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,770
Ricky Martin?

192
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,350
Ricky?

193
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,770
Ricky? Come to mama.

194
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,490
Ricky?

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,450
Ricky Martin? Ricky?

196
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,370
Ricky?

197
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,530
Oh!

198
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,040
Ricky, you got some explaining to do.

199
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,920
Ricky?

200
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,430
Oh, thank God.

201
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,310
What happened to you?

202
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,060
Bad things

203
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,570
Dead things

204
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,990
Sad things have to happen

205
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,740
Bad things

206
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,460
Dead things

207
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,880
Sad things have to happen.

208
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,970
Hey, Miss Newman.

209
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,470
Wow, Brian.
Are you stalking me now?

210
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,020
No, Rachael. If I was stalking you,
you'd know it.

211
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,940
I mean--you wouldn't know it.
You know?

212
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,810
I thought we should get together and...

213
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,780
discuss the state of the union
and life in general.

214
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,650
Get to the point, Brian.

215
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,530
My inside source says
he has narrowed it down.

216
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,620
Guess who's still in the running?

217
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,620
Keith, Cassandra and me.

218
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,540
Unless you can raise your GPA.

219
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,290
That problem's already solved.

220
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,130
Do you want to catch a bite
to eat tomorrow night,

221
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,510
maybe some dinner and discuss it?

222
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,840
What's to discuss? It's no big news.

223
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,720
We were always the front runners.

224
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,730
We could get together and
form an alliance,

225
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,010
eliminate our competition.

226
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,180
That sounds intriguing but...

227
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,100
-I have a paper to write.
-A paper?

228
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,190
We should get to know each other better.

229
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,650
Is it just me or is there
unspoken sexual tension between us?

230
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,360
We should bring it to the
surface and stop lying to each other.

231
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,660
Are you on crack?

232
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,410
I don't know. It was white,
it was in a pipe--

233
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,250
-So, what do you say?
-I have a paper to write.

234
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,410
No, no, no...

235
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,040
I won't take no for an answer
twice in one day.

236
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,040
You have to eat, right? I have to eat.
We both have to eat.

237
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,920
Let's just eat together.
It's no big deal.

238
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,720
I was just fucking around with
this sexual tension stuff.

239
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,430
I just throw stuff out there.

240
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,850
I am crazy, I am like a volcano,
just waiting to erupt--

241
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,970
Okay!

242
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,890
Okay, fine. Pick me up at 8:00.

243
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,940
-Eight? Like 8:00 pm?
-Yeah.

244
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,060
-Between 7:00 and 9:00?
-Yeah!

245
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,400
Okay.

246
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,860
Because it's great for me--

247
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,280
-I will see you at 8:00.
-Whatever.

248
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,320
Maybe I will be there five minutes later.

249
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,200
So...what are you doing for Spring Break?

250
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,910
I am just going to hang around and
get some work done.

251
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,880
What, "hang around"?
You mean stay on campus?

252
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,340
Yeah.

253
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,550
You're not going home?

254
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,300
Why?

255
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,260
Because I have work to do.

256
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,680
My family's coming for my mom's birthday

257
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,890
to see how the other half lives.

258
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,140
-Okay, that sounds terrible.
-I know.

259
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,810
What are you doing?

260
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,190
Bobby's taking me up to his
cabin in the Northern Cascade--

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,690
Cassandra, don't call
him Bobby in front of me.

262
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,610
I am sorry.

263
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,530
Professor Starkman is
taking me up to his cabin.

264
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,400
When do you guys leave?

265
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,820
He's got to go upstate first,
to meet Diane and Louisa.

266
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,830
You mean, his wife and his daughter?

267
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,540
Whatever! Yes, them.

268
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,120
He's meeting them at his in-laws.

269
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,580
I can't stand how much of
his time they take up.

270
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,880
Cass, they're his family!

271
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,250
Whatever.

272
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,130
I am late for a study session.
I should just go.

273
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,260
I can't believe you're actually
going out with Brian.

274
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,060
How did that happen?

275
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,850
Okay...

276
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,900
the other day, our eyes met
across a crowded room,

277
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,150
and there was this--this spark,

278
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,740
the sign I have been waiting for
my whole life.

279
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,160
It was then that I knew that
Brian was my soul mate.

280
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,660
-Oh my God.
-I know.

281
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,210
-Really?
-No, not really.

282
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,760
It's great to be with you tonight.

283
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,680
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hi.

284
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,310
Hi. Can I get you something to drink?

285
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,360
Yes. I will have a Kettle One martini,
straight up,

286
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,360
very dry. Very, very dry.

287
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,900
And the lady will have...

288
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,950
-I will have a glass of house red.
-House red.

289
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,700
Good. I will be right back.

290
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,820
-So, you look great.
-Thanks.

291
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,030
Your hair is different.
It looks good.

292
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,420
-Thanks.
-No problem.

293
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,290
It's great that we finally
have some "us" time.

294
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,420
-You and I hanging out.
-I agree.

295
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,100
Yeah. Listen, Rach,

296
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,430
before we embark on our evening,

297
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,520
I have a confession to make.

298
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,230
Can you wait until we get our drinks

299
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,520
before you start making your confessions?

300
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,860
-Oh yeah, sure.
-Thanks.

301
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,160
Look. Our drinks.

302
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,660
Thank you.

303
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,420
-There you go.
-Thank you.

304
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,960
It's my first day.

305
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,510
So, ready to order?

306
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,260
Can you just give us a minute here?

307
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,720
Sure.

308
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,720
Take your time.

309
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,980
Thank you.

310
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,650
Okay. What would you like to confess?

311
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,940
This is difficult for me,

312
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,780
because I really want us to
remain friends after--

313
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,820
regardless of who Starkman
picks for the TA position.

314
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,160
Wow, I am touched.
Brian, I really am.

315
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,330
You should know I am determined
to get the position.

316
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,790
Over the last few months,

317
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,550
I have been doing a little
research on Cassandra Blair.

318
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,840
What kind of research?

319
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,470
Let's just say that if
she gets the position,

320
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,970
the Dean's office is going to
receive an anonymous letter

321
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,430
regarding her and Starkman's relationship,

322
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,640
accompanied by some very revealing photographs.

323
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,480
-How Christian of you.
-Thanks.

324
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,860
I guess that narrows it down to three.

325
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,690
Yeah.

326
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,240
You know who my father is, right?

327
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,580
Yes, we're all in awe of your family's money.

328
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,120
You know, you and Keith are very smart.

329
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,620
So I have had to go to great lengths

330
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,630
to ensure that my bright future in
the FBI goes without a hitch.

331
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,010
What are you smiling at?

332
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,050
This.

333
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,520
That is the press release

334
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,770
for the new Carson-Leads Behavioral
Sciences Building.

335
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,350
It's just one of my dad's new pet projects.

336
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,860
So...

337
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,280
I have an offer you can't refuse.

338
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,410
Drop out of the race for the TA position,

339
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,830
and I will ensure you have seven digits
of my family's gratitude.

340
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,880
Brian?

341
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,800
Are you bribing me now?

342
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,590
Bribe? Did I say bribe?

343
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,420
Just think of it as a business opportunity.

344
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,680
Trust me,

345
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,430
the alternative wouldn't be too pleasant.

346
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,970
"I will let you be in my dreams
if I can be in yours."

347
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,010
-What?
-It's a quote.

348
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,230
Bob Dylan, maybe you have heard of him?

349
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,440
-Oh, yeah.
-You know, Brian,

350
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,310
you should get out more.

351
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,650
Maybe I will.

352
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,200
The night's young.

353
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,700
That it is.

354
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,240
Cheers.

355
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,710
Don't!

356
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,630
Shh!

357
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,810
We're home, we're home.

358
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,940
Wow!

359
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,400
This is like...a room.

360
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,540
Do you want to be my girl?

361
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:20,290
Do you want to be my friend?

362
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:26,010
Do you want to start it all?

363
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,470
We can stop if you want.

364
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,640
-No, no...I just don't-
-What, you don't have any?

365
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,560
Don't worry, I will take care of
everything when the time comes.

366
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,690
Oh, the old "pull out and pray" trick.

367
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,190
Great, a Renaissance man.

368
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,570
Wait a second!

369
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,780
The convenience store, down the street--

370
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,370
I will just go down there,
it's right around the corner.

371
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,080
It's really convenient and
I will get some, I will get tons.

372
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,040
Wait a minute, what am I saying?

373
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,500
My roommate's got tons of them,
drawers full of them.

374
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,040
A real prophylactic factory.

375
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,380
Are we done here?

376
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,510
No, we're not done.

377
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,220
I will walk down the hall,
and get some from a friend.

378
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,100
-Oh, great.
-Make yourself comfortable.

379
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,730
Sure, great.

380
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,860
I will be here.

381
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,340
Jeez. A piss-sheet.

382
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,640
Jesus.

383
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,070
What the fuck.

384
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,800
Ribbed, for her pleasure.

385
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,180
Yep, I just killed Brian.

386
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,100
But you have got to look at
the positive side...

387
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,600
I am killing for a better tomorrow.

388
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,680
Once I get into the FBI,

389
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,770
I will be able to stop dozens,

390
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,110
maybe even hundreds of serial
killers every year.

391
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,980
Okay, think about it...

392
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,190
I am killing the few to save the many.

393
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,990
Sort of like Robin Hood, you know?

394
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,950
God, I think I need some professional help.

395
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,330
Rachael, have you ever been
to a psychiatrist before?

396
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,710
No.

397
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,290
-No, how does it work?
-It works like this.

398
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,250
You want answers,
so we get together weekly,

399
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,590
and we ask the questions that
will lead you to your answers.

400
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,180
All right?

401
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,560
I could tell you anything,
and you'd still never know me.

402
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,180
You could, and that's your choice.

403
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,850
But why would you lie to me?

404
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,770
Because I don't expose my
Achilles' heel to anyone.

405
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,610
-Why do you say that?
-I just need to be on watch.

406
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,320
If I am not looking out for
number one, then who is?

407
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,580
It's a dog-eat-dog-world out there,

408
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,410
and my future depends on not
getting eaten by the other dogs.

409
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,210
I have schedules, appointments and dreams

410
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,000
that only I can fulfill.

411
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,630
No one is going to do that for me.

412
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,760
Who do you think is keeping you
from achieving these goals?

413
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,470
-Other people.
-What people?

414
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,300
Anyone who gets in my way.

415
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,230
If you could be anyone in the
world, except yourself,

416
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,190
who would that be?

417
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,520
Elizabeth McGuire.

418
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,230
Elizabeth McGuire? Who's she?

419
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,150
She's Professor Starkman's present TA.

420
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,530
And the next in line to go to Quantico.

421
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,080
-And Quantico is?
-My goal.

422
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,580
-My destiny.
-I see.

423
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,290
Have you ever wanted something so bad

424
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,590
that you'd do anything to get it?

425
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,090
Sure.

426
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,840
Go on.

427
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,010
And that's why I went to West Washington.

428
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,270
I have always known that, really,

429
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,100
there were only three other people

430
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,600
who could steal the TA position away from me.

431
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,560
What happens if you don't get the position?

432
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,940
I can't even consider that.

433
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,070
Failure is not an option.
I will get the position.

434
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,450
-How can you be so sure?
-Because I am.

435
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,000
-Why don't we stop there?
-Okay.

436
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,750
My secretary will get your billing info.

437
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,130
Okay.

438
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,670
So, same time next week?

439
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,390
-You bet.
-Okay.

440
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,390
Starkman.

441
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,970
Hey, Bobby. It's Eric.

442
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,140
Hey, Eric. What's up?

443
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,520
I just had a first time session
with one of your students.

444
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,600
Wow, wow, wow...

445
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,400
Aren't we violating some sort
of privacy code here?

446
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,900
Yes and no. I will tell you what...

447
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,900
I won't tell you the name,

448
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,700
if you promise not to say it
once you have figured it out.

449
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:07,370
-Is that a deal?
-Okay. Fire away.

450
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,370
All right.

451
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,540
I think I have identified this
person as a textbook sociopath.

452
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,460
It's a prerequisite for getting
into college in the first place.

453
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,380
Tell me about it. Still, this
girl has no concept of reality

454
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,930
or the difference between right or wrong.

455
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,680
A girl.

456
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,310
Mmm, the plot thickens.

457
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,850
She's obsessed with becoming
your assistant next semester.

458
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,770
If that's her obsession,
it's no big deal.

459
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,020
These kids think I am their
ticket to the FBI.

460
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,780
Just keep your eyes open.

461
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,070
This girl--

462
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,650
she scared me.

463
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:47,200
Jesus, if she's that dangerous,
tell me her name

464
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,830
before she turns up in class
with an AK-47.

465
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,000
I can't do that. I have already
broken the law by placing this call.

466
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,340
Just be aware this student's in your class.

467
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,880
What exactly do you mean, "be aware"?

468
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,720
25 years in the FBI...turn your radar on.

469
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,680
Just make sure she doesn't get out of hand.

470
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,810
-She's identified three of her peers--
-Dr. Daniels?

471
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,200
-Okay, okay, Mother.
-Mom?

472
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,280
I have got to go, I have got an appointment.

473
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,200
I love you. I do.

474
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,120
Okay, I will see you this weekend. Bye.

475
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,370
Rachael?

476
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,870
I am so sorry to disturb you.

477
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,960
I didn't realize you were on the phone

478
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,460
-and your secretary wasn't there.
-It's okay.

479
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,960
I just left my keys here.

480
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,680
I am such a textbook nut case sometimes.

481
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,010
I'd probably lose my head if
it wasn't screwed on.

482
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,720
Oh, there they are.

483
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,600
It's so nice that you stay in
touch with your mom.

484
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,030
-How old is she?
-72.

485
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,240
Wow.

486
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,530
72, that's a great age.

487
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,530
So many new and exciting things,
the golden years.

488
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,740
Grandchildren?

489
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,250
No. I am--

490
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,620
My wife and I never had children.

491
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,920
Was she not able to?

492
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,340
Actually, we're divorced.

493
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,460
I have another patient coming in soon.

494
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,130
I have to prepare for him.

495
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,080
So I will have to ask you to leave.

496
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,970
Which is it, Eric?

497
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,020
An appointment downtown or a
patient in your office?

498
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,440
It's not nice to lie to your
dear old mom.

499
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,640
See you next week.

500
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,210
After my session with Eric,
I really needed some therapy.

501
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,710
That guy just about drove me nuts.

502
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,550
So, I went back to something
my dad always said,

503
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,430
"nothing like a change of
scenery to clear your head,

504
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,930
to ease the burden of a busy schedule."

505
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,100
Besides,

506
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,350
tonight's the Behavioral
Sciences party at the Dean's.

507
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,900
I have to look good.
I want to be dressed to kill.

508
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,730
Sometimes she feels so sad

509
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,830
And other times feels twice as bad

510
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:51,460
When the tears are in her eyes

511
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,250
She never cries

512
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,220
Ordinary girl

513
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,140
I know

514
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,900
We're different

515
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,440
But I am stranger in the world

516
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,320
Ordinary girl

517
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,530
Ordinary.

518
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,460
-Excuse me?
-Bite me, Barbie.

519
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,630
The Anthony Perkins character
in Psycho was modeled on Ed Gein.

520
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,550
My heart rate nearly triples when I get there

521
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,010
and see the vultures have
descended upon Starkman.

522
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,260
He broke the mold because he only
killed two people in his entire career.

523
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,560
I must have lost track of time running on.

524
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,640
I had planned to get here early to get

525
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,850
as much time with Starkman as possible.

526
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,310
And now I am late. This is a disaster.

527
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,310
Bitch!

528
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,860
...for Leatherface in The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre--

529
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,320
-Hello, Miss Brown.
-I will be right back.

530
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,280
It's good to see you.

531
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,410
-Hey, how is it going?
-Hey!

532
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,120
How was your date with Brian?

533
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,540
Fine. Short. I don't know.

534
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,590
Short? How short was he?

535
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,460
I mean, "it."

536
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,970
We didn't get that far.
He went home after dinner.

537
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,300
What do you mean? Why did
you come to borrow a rubber,

538
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,720
-if he went home after dinner?
-What's up with the third degree?

539
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,850
I am just confused. Did you
guys get it on or not?

540
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,060
It's none of your business.

541
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,190
-Can we drop this, please?
-Whatever.

542
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,150
Sometimes I don't understand you.

543
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,320
It's like you're not even here.

544
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,360
What did you do last night?

545
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,780
-Bobby came over for--
-Cassandra!

546
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,000
I am sorry. Professor Starkman
came over for a study session.

547
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,080
And let me assure you, it was
definitely not short.

548
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,090
I am going to vomit.

549
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:05,330
What are you smiling at, freak?

550
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,420
Come here.

551
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,710
Bob--I mean the professor,

552
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,810
said I am a shoo-in for the TA position.

553
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,220
I wasn't supposed to tell anyone,

554
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,430
but since we are so close...

555
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,180
I was going to burst.

556
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,520
Now I get to spend all this
time with my sweetie.

557
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,440
And his wife will think we're working.

558
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,190
Wait, maybe I will go to Quantico.

559
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,110
How great would that be?

560
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,110
Just don't tell anyone, okay?

561
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,360
-Not even Brian.
-Don't worry.

562
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,370
Your secret's safe with me.

563
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,450
This party's such a dud.

564
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,160
Let's blow it off and you give
me the details.

565
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,080
Perfect. Let me talk to Starkman,

566
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,830
and we will go to Jittery Joe's
for coffee.

567
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,250
No! It's way too crowded.

568
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,170
You don't want anyone to know
about you and Bobby.

569
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,390
Let's grab some wine and go to
your room.

570
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,180
That sounds great!

571
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,810
Just make sure you don't tell anyone, okay?

572
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,390
-Don't let me down.
-Don't worry,

573
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,020
I would never let you down.

574
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,230
Like I said, Cassie,

575
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,820
student-teacher relationships
just never work out.

576
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,540
It's Cassandra,
I can't get to the phone,

577
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,460
so leave a quickie
and I will get back to you.

578
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,130
Hello Cassandra. Professor Starkman here.

579
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,510
Listen, it's 11:25 and you
missed your study session.

580
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,430
Call me back to reschedule.

581
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,360
Doctor Daniels?

582
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,530
I am sorry to drop in without
an appointment,

583
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,200
but there is something on my mind.

584
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,500
Sure.

585
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,700
Sure, Rachael.

586
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,120
-How are things with you?
-They couldn't be better.

587
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,160
Really?

588
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,290
Any word on that TA job yet?

589
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,590
He won't announce
it until before Spring Break.

590
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,800
When does that start for you guys?

591
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,590
-End of the week.
-Really?

592
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,130
-Two days?
-Yeah.

593
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,260
-And how do you feel about that?
-Pretty confident.

594
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:27,430
-You think you will get the job?
-I don't think. I know.

595
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,850
Okay, Rachael.

596
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,900
Worst case scenario:

597
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,560
you don't get the job. What then?

598
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,150
What are you talking about,
Dr. Daniels?

599
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,030
It's mine.

600
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,360
You want me to come up with some
idea of what's wrong with me,

601
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,660
but I will be honest. I came here

602
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,740
to tell you I am not coming
back next week.

603
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,750
Don't worry, I have every
intention to pay for your time.

604
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,670
However, I feel the problem
we have connecting lies mostly with you.

605
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,000
Look, this is a small town.

606
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,420
My guess is you know almost everyone here.

607
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,720
You were born here, right?

608
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,430
It must be so disappointing to
see all these college kids

609
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,350
come in and out of your town
every year,

610
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,270
moving on to bigger and
better opportunities,

611
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,230
while you stay here, year after year,
getting older and older.

612
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,560
And all while taking care of
your dear old mom.

613
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,140
And on top of this, you're divorced?

614
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,270
God! The female population
in this town,

615
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,230
aside from the sexy little college
girls running around,

616
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,620
must be pretty weak.

617
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,030
This alone would cripple any man.

618
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,580
Your level of frustration must
be through the roof.

619
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,700
A dead-end job with no love life,

620
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,620
all while taking care of your sick mom.

621
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,840
Just the other day,

622
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,210
I noticed you were judging me.

623
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,090
Is that fair? I mean really, is that?

624
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,390
I don't think so.

625
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,560
Your life is very similar to Ed Gein's.

626
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,930
Ed Gein?

627
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,770
Yes, Ed Gein. Very famous serial killer.

628
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,280
A bachelor, raised by his
domineering mother,

629
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,900
until she died when he was
roughly your age.

630
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:17,870
God, he went nuts! He couldn't
handle the loss.

631
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,280
What would you do without your mother?

632
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,120
Okay Rachael, that's enough.

633
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,040
You don't know me,
and I don't know you.

634
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,710
We were getting to know each other.

635
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,330
These sessions are a process.

636
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,840
So don't go jumping to conclusions.

637
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,550
No. I am not jumping to any
conclusions here.

638
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,930
If you just open up your eyes,
you'd see I am already there.

639
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,430
Have a good day, Doctor.

640
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:52,900
Let's talk about
Ted Bundy for a minute, shall we?

641
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,820
What kind of a killer was he?

642
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,820
How was he perceived?

643
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:04,080
Mr. Lawson wishes to participate.
Please, let's hear it.

644
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,540
He was perceived
as a very organized killer.

645
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,290
-Very calculated.
-Hmphf!

646
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,670
You don't agree, Miss Newman?

647
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,170
Yes and no.

648
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,680
Come on, this guy planned each
and every detail in advance.

649
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,430
He chose his victims with extreme accuracy,
stalked them meticulously,

650
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,520
and waited for the precise moment to attack.

651
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,680
All while maintaining an air of patience

652
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,980
not even the FBI's greatest could penetrate.

653
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,860
-No offense, sir.
-None taken.

654
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,320
-But I still don't agree.
-And he picked all his dumping sites

655
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,860
with the outmost caution.

656
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,280
He was unquestionably an organized killer.

657
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,790
-Premeditated, with a capital "P."
-Capital "P"?

658
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,290
It's a letter in the alphabet.

659
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,670
Between "O" and "Q."

660
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,510
You have something to say, Miss Newman?

661
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,510
He started out organized,

662
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,560
but spiraled down late
in his so-called career.

663
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,980
He began to keep bodies for days,
washing their hair

664
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,690
and even applying makeup before
disposing of them.

665
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,310
And he littered the dumping sites
with evidence, using the outmost caution.

666
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,900
However, his last victim,
and his youngest girl ever,

667
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,700
fell out of his typical victim selection.

668
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,360
She was chosen out of sheer availability.

669
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,740
The sheer need to kill.

670
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,620
He was both,

671
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,330
an organized killer
and off-the-charts lunatic.

672
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,240
With a capital "L."

673
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,040
You're right. He was both.

674
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,080
Very impressive, Miss Newman.

675
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,040
Now, Professor Starkman,
how would you classify a killer

676
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,420
whose downward spiral was
actually calculated into their grand scheme?

677
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,560
That's a very interesting hypothesis,
Miss Newman.

678
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,300
Unfortunately, in this class,
we stick to the facts.

679
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,350
And there's no known
case-study of that nature.

680
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,560
Keith's little display of brainpower

681
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,360
was totally unacceptable.

682
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:50,900
It's a day before Starkman
announces his new TA.

683
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,650
This could be catastrophic.

684
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,860
I wasn't about to watch years of
hard work go down the drain.

685
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,830
It was time to pick Keith's brain.

686
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,790
You know that feeling you get

687
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,170
when you realize that there are
people out there just like you?

688
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,340
It almost makes you feel normal.

689
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,380
All this time,
I thought he was taking notes.

690
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:17,050
But no. Look at his work, his sketches.

691
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,970
They're absolutely brilliant.

692
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,350
This may be a waste of a rare mind.

693
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,310
But, a girl's got to do what
a girl's got to do.

694
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,190
Hi, Professor Starkman.

695
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,270
-Hey!
-Miss Brown.

696
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,360
-How are you?
-Good.

697
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,490
So, the big day's tomorrow, right?

698
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,320
-What do you mean?
-For the TA position.

699
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,290
-You're announcing it tomorrow?
-Yes, of course.

700
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,960
-At noon, in my classroom.
-I can't wait.

701
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,000
My chances are much better this
year than they were last.

702
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,510
I would think so. It's a very
tight race this year.

703
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,220
Mmm-hmm.

704
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,760
Were you looking for Cassandra?
She wasn't in class.

705
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,540
She probably left for Spring Break.

706
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,730
-Well, actually, the--
-It's Cassandra, isn't it?

707
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,900
She got the position.

708
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,690
Good for her, but--

709
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,820
I can't say I am not disappointed,

710
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:00,350
but "what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger."

711
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,650
I will see you.

712
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,440
It's Cassandra.
I can't get to the phone,

713
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,860
so leave a quickie and
I will get back to you.

714
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,500
-Hello?
-Eric, for God's sakes!

715
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,750
She's dead!

716
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,930
-Who is?
-She is!

717
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,760
The "she" whose name we agreed
not to say aloud.

718
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,470
My patient? Dead? How?

719
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,100
She hung herself.

720
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,020
You didn't say she was suicidal.

721
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,650
She had suicidal tendencies,

722
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,740
but I was more concerned
for the sociopathic

723
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,820
and homicidal patterns that were emerging.

724
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,360
Spare me your psychobabble bullshit.

725
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,120
This girl...

726
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,910
she may have been a little forward,
but she wasn't crazy!

727
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,040
I am sorry,
but you didn't see what I saw.

728
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,170
-She was not a pretty picture.
-Listen, Eric,

729
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,050
I spent a lot of time with her,

730
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,260
and I have to say I don't
agree on this one.

731
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,180
There are tons of kids
in your classes.

732
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:39,720
How could you know her
as well as you think you did?

733
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,640
We're bound by the guidelines

734
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,730
of doctor-patient privilege, right?

735
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,070
You didn't, Bob?
You weren't sleeping with her?

736
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,070
No wonder she was obsessing over you.

737
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,620
-How could you do this to Diane?
-None of your business.

738
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:05,250
Fine. Why did you call me, then?

739
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,960
Because you're my fucking shrink!

740
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,910
I am sorry.
I just needed someone to talk to.

741
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,460
I loved her.

742
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,840
Can you get me some Valium?

743
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:27,130
Yeah. I will call it in to the pharmacy.

744
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,550
Can I give you some advice?

745
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,100
Hello?

746
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,530
So, here we are. The big day.

747
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,660
In moments,
I will be crowned Starkman's new TA,

748
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,000
and be one step closer to the FBI.

749
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:01,960
Too bad Brian, Cassie and Keith
couldn't be here to watch me.

750
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:03,630
But wherever they are,

751
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,590
I am sure they will realize they
didn't give up their lives in vain.

752
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,880
I will make them proud.

753
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,270
Guys, can I have your attention, please?

754
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,480
Professor Starkman told me to tell you

755
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,610
that unfortunately he's decided
that his sabbatical,

756
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,690
which was scheduled for next year,

757
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,190
is now effective immediately.

758
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:32,200
In other words, there will be no
TA position for next semester.

759
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,990
Sorry.

760
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,790
Have a great Spring Break.

761
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,890
This is an obsession

762
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,770
A kind of aggression with himself

763
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,850
It's the way he will always be

764
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:05,770
He loves to rebel

765
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,490
To go against his Ten Commandments

766
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,360
For him

767
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,700
That's just being free

768
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:16,200
And over there

769
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,500
Stands my angry angel

770
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:21,500
And he's shaking his head

771
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,130
In disgrace with me

772
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,710
Over there

773
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,260
Stands my angry angel

774
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,930
And he's frowning like hell

775
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,970
But I am not feeling guilty.

776
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,440
Professor Starkman?

777
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,780
Professor Starkman?

778
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,870
Rachael.

779
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,500
Why--

780
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,880
why haven't you gone home?

781
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,450
I will just hang around
here during the break.

782
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,590
Why?

783
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,790
Don't you have family
waiting at home for you?

784
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,170
No.

785
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,960
Actually, they will come visit me here.

786
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:26,690
Are you okay, Professor?

787
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,720
I heard about the change in plans.

788
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:37,100
Is that why you're here?

789
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,650
Is that all you people ever think about?

790
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,780
The Goddamn teaching assistant job?

791
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,500
Quantico?

792
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,530
Don't you kids get it?
It's not that important.

793
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,830
It's important to me.

794
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,500
I have a schedule, a plan,
a dream. I need it!

795
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,580
What makes you think you will get it?

796
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,960
Other students have applied too.

797
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,930
-Some more qualified than you.
-I beg your pardon?

798
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,550
I believe I am the most
qualified for this position.

799
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,060
Name someone who's
more dedicated or intelligent,

800
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,980
that's had more experience than me.

801
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:18,400
You don't know what you're talking about.

802
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,810
Go home.

803
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,000
-What are you doing?
-Shh.

804
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,210
Just relax, Bobby.

805
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,850
Where did you get that?

806
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,020
And the dress?

807
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,650
-What's going on here?
-Bobby, what's wrong?

808
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,940
Don't fuck with me.

809
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,860
That necklace...

810
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,950
and Cassandra's dress.

811
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,240
It was a present.

812
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,740
Bobby, don't you remember?

813
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,040
You gave it to me.

814
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,380
Stop it...

815
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,880
this instant!

816
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,420
I said, go home.

817
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,050
I mean it.

818
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,510
I have a confession to make.

819
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,520
I have had feelings for you for
a long time,

820
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,350
longer than you can imagine.

821
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:44,310
I have always wanted something to
happen between us.

822
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,610
Something beautiful.

823
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,950
I love you, Bobby.

824
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,070
-What?!
-Please, don't be upset, Bobby.

825
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,080
Stop calling me Bobby!

826
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,290
Okay. I am a little confused.

827
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,000
You are? How do you think I feel?

828
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,840
Rachael--Ms. Newman...

829
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,970
-this is unacceptable.
-It is?

830
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,050
But it was okay
for you and Cassandra?

831
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,720
How did--

832
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,220
I don't know what
you're talking about. Leave.

833
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,390
I have always loved you.

834
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,230
Ever since I first saw you.

835
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,560
Before Diane ever loved you.
Before Cassandra.

836
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,900
Before Clara even ever loved you.
It was always me.

837
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,780
Don't you get it?

838
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,950
How did you know about Clara?

839
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,360
That was six years ago.

840
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,900
I was there, Bobby.

841
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,150
-Clara was babysitting me that night.
-Clara.

842
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,280
He's here! Do something.

843
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,990
I was in Bateman's apartment.

844
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,700
Clara used to babysit me
all the time.

845
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:50,080
She'd tell me about your
relationship with her.

846
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,090
She'd show me pictures of you.

847
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,210
You were my first crush.

848
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,420
You were in Patrick Bateman's
apartment...

849
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,840
...the night he killed Clara?

850
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:04,590
Yeah.

851
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,520
I know you quit the FBI because
of what happened.

852
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:13,560
I think you blame yourself for
her death.

853
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,770
Bobby, all work, no play.

854
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,190
-You want to play?
-Uh-huh.

855
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,320
Okay.

856
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,990
She was the one who looked through your
stuff and found Bateman's file.

857
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,780
She's tracked him down.

858
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,780
And she went to his apartment
that night and dragged me along.

859
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,410
Rich and good-looking.
Why are we together again?

860
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,290
You shouldn't blame yourself.

861
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,920
She went over there to cheat on you.

862
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,340
-She was a slut.
-Shut up!

863
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,550
It's the truth.
She got what she deserved.

864
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:48,300
And so did Cassandra. She thought
you didn't love her enough.

865
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,970
It's my turn now.
I have waited six years.

866
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,850
I won't let anyone stop me,
not even Diane and your baby.

867
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,350
Don't you threaten my family.

868
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,190
So now you care about your family?

869
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,900
You just can't hold
a relationship together.

870
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,530
-Please.
-You think you're a catch.

871
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,660
But you're just the
opportunity of a lifetime.

872
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,370
-Stop.
-After you can't break any more hearts,

873
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,630
you will still break
one more...your baby daughter's.

874
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,750
Please, no more.

875
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,640
Goodbye, Bobby.

876
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:38,230
The sun is shining

877
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,940
We should be making haste

878
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,650
I hope you had a safe trip.

879
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,870
Hey, nice mop!

880
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,960
Sweet dreams.

881
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:15,140
We are sleeping on our feet

882
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:18,690
We stole the songs from birds in trees

883
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,190
But it's time on easy street

884
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,860
Now it's past, and it's not me.

885
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,740
Hey!

886
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,660
Hey, stop!

887
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,910
Yeah, that's it. Bring it back.

888
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,710
Yeah, bring it--yeah.

889
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,740
Back it up. That's it. You got it.

890
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,760
Bring it in here. Thank you very much.

891
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,010
Driving around like goddamn maniacs.

892
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,560
That's good. Perfect.
Thank you very much.

893
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,960
I sure do hope you have got--

894
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:01,130
Holy shit.

895
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,230
(car door closes)

896
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:07,390
-What the hell's going on?
-Oh, that?

897
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,390
That's Professor Starkman.
He's out of it tonight.

898
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,910
You have reached Professor Starkman,
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.

899
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,660
Please, leave a message.

900
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,460
Hey, Bobby, it's Eric.

901
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:34,580
I felt bad about the other day.
I wanted to say I am sorry.

902
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,710
I hope you got that
prescription filled okay.

903
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,130
Call me if you need anything. Bye.

904
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,640
-Dr. Daniels' office.
-Mary, if that's Bobby Starkman,

905
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:54,190
-I will take it.
-He will take you at 3:00. All right.

906
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:00,150
It was for an appointment,
not the professor.

907
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,900
Okay.

908
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,490
I put her in at 3:00,
Rachael Newman.

909
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,490
She wanted to come in today.

910
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,450
What?

911
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,000
Rachael Newman? Are you sure?

912
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah. Are you okay?

913
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,380
I can reschedule if you want.

914
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,050
I am--

915
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,350
no, I am--I am fine.

916
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,560
It's just--it's been a long day.

917
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,480
-Let me know if you need anything.
-Sure.

918
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,020
Bye.

919
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,230
Bye, Mary.

920
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:57,040
Come on.

921
00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:01,210
You have reached Professor Starkman
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.

922
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,130
Please, leave a message.

923
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,550
It's Eric again.
Call me when you get this.

924
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,510
I am really confused about something.

925
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,720
If you don't reach me by 3:00,

926
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,730
I will drop by your
office between 4:00 and 4:30.

927
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,520
Bye.

928
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,250
-Hi, honey!
-Mom!

929
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,540
-Dad?
-We made it!

930
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,130
Hello, princess.

931
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,550
Won't you invite us in?

932
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:49,180
Jeez, I am sorry. Please, come in.

933
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,470
Wow! Hi, happy birthday!

934
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,890
Thank you, sweetie.

935
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,600
We have been planning this for months.

936
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,180
Sweet Jesus! It smells
like somebody died in here.

937
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:04,940
The toilet's clogged up
and maintenance isn't up and running,

938
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:08,280
-so there's nothing I can do.
-That's wretched.

939
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:12,320
Sweetheart,
you are such a clothes-horse.

940
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:15,990
-What will I do with you?
-Don't open the closet.

941
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,460
-Your present's in there.
-Oh, I am sorry, sweetie.

942
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,200
Look at me, always spoiling the surprise.

943
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,290
What will we eat? I am hungry.

944
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,670
Good. I made reservations for 5:30.

945
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,040
I am going out of town later tonight.

946
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,750
Is this restaurant reasonably priced?

947
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,010
Yes.

948
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,300
Is there an early bird special?

949
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:42,180
-I don't think so.
-That's too bad.

950
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,640
-What's it called?
-Chez Gerard's.

951
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:49,060
Is that Italian? Your father
cannot digest Italian food.

952
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,060
-It's too spicy.
-Mother, it's French.

953
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,150
French!

954
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:58,320
-How sophisticated!
-Yeah, okay.

955
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:01,320
I have got to finish packing and
finish writing some papers.

956
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,200
So why don't you go back to the motel

957
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,740
and we will meet at the restaurant at 5:30?

958
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,750
Sounds good to me.
I have got to use the head.

959
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,710
Get maintenance up here.

960
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,710
Daddy, I called.

961
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,420
How will we ever find this place?

962
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,550
We will be back at 5:15 to pick you up.

963
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,840
-Okay.
-Bye, princess.

964
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:23,340
I love you, guys.

965
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,800
-You have reached Professor Starkman

966
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,090
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.

967
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,180
Please, leave a message.

968
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:07,350
Bobby, it's Eric.
I know you're going through tough times,

969
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,890
but she--the she who hung herself--

970
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,230
she made an appointment to see me.
I don't know if it's a joke,

971
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,150
but something's off.
Call me, all right?

972
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,990
Roses are red,
violets are blue,

973
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,740
the Daniels will
soon be calling back you.

974
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,040
Mom, you have got to
change that message.

975
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:32,580
I will come by around 5:30 to
pick you up for your big date.

976
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:36,130
And I will get you back in time
for Murder She Wrote. Bye.

977
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,810
-Bon appetit.
-Happy birthday, Mom.

978
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:54,870
- Oh!
- It's gorgeous.

979
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,480
This is the most beautiful thing

980
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:03,240
I have ever received in my life.
How did you afford it?

981
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:09,200
-Stainless steel.
-It's silver, you old lump.

982
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,790
Stainless steel. Silver has...

983
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,790
that distinguished look about it.

984
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,750
Anyway, as I was saying before,

985
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,830
I said to Leora she ought to have
it looked at immediately.

986
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:27,210
So what does she do?
She waits an entire month.

987
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,170
And when she sees the doctor,

988
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,930
he orders a biopsy and it
comes back positive.

989
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,630
Well, could you just die?

990
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,140
If she had taken my advice,

991
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,220
she could have avoided this mess!

992
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:43,470
I know we will eat dinner at some point.

993
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:47,850
-The question is, when?
-I will go use the restroom.

994
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,860
Don't forget to wash your hands.

995
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,530
Now, where is my steak knife?

996
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,490
My mother drives me crazy.

997
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,280
That sounds cliché,
but how many people envision

998
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,490
carving into their mother's neck
and yanking out her vocal cords?

999
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:07,660
Or ripping her tongue out and
serving it to her as an early-bird special?

1000
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,000
-Bonsoir.
-Bonsoir. Daniels. Table for two.

1001
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,300
I have got a table right here for you.

1002
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:14,760
After you.

1003
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,090
Why don't you sit on the other side?

1004
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,050
Get a view of the whole thing.

1005
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:25,810
Excusez-moi, garcon.

1006
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,100
Could I have un autre, uh...

1007
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,270
steak knife, s'il-vous-plait?

1008
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,050
Oh.

1009
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,780
-Of course. Voila, madame.
-Merci.

1010
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,780
How about a table closer to the window?

1011
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,990
-That would be very nice.
-Okay, I will ask.

1012
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:42,700
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1013
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:46,790
I was wondering if we could get a
table closer to the window.

1014
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,290
That section is closed for Spring Break.

1015
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,040
Sorry.

1016
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:56,260
No problem. I understand.
This table is fine.

1017
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:59,590
Good.
Can I get you something to drink?

1018
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,800
I will have a whiskey sour. Mom?

1019
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:05,430
I will need some water to take my pills.

1020
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,890
As I stare at myself in the mirror,

1021
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,270
I realize I can't let my mother
get the best of me.

1022
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,360
I am Robert Starkman's next TA.

1023
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,530
And that's where
I will focus my energies.

1024
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,450
I should set up a meeting
with Bobby when I get back.

1025
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,160
Maybe we can brainstorm at
his cabin tonight.

1026
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,950
I will make him my special eggs.

1027
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,170
Sorry.

1028
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,250
Ready to order?

1029
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,420
Maybe you'd give us some more time?

1030
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,800
Sure. Of course.

1031
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,800
I will be just over there.

1032
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,100
-Take your time.
-Thank you.

1033
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,890
-Cheers.
-Cheers, my dear.

1034
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:55,610
Oh my God.

1035
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:04,530
Hello, Dr. Daniels.
It's great to see you.

1036
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,870
And this must be your mother.

1037
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,580
Hello, Mrs. Daniels.
How are you doing?

1038
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,540
I am fine, dear.

1039
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,960
Oh my God.

1040
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:19,670
I just love that hat.

1041
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,840
I'd kill for a hat like that.

1042
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,340
It is just so cute!

1043
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,640
I have to be getting back to my table.

1044
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:32,390
-It was great meeting you.
-It was nice meeting you too.

1045
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,400
See you later, Eric.

1046
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,570
Who is that pretty girl?
A new girlfriend, I hope.

1047
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:47,360
No.

1048
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:51,150
She's a patient.

1049
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,990
A very sick patient.

1050
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,870
-Excuse me for a second.
-Of course.

1051
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,870
-I will be right back.
-Yes.

1052
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,210
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

1053
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:10,550
I am a friend of your
daughter's. Ms. Newman,

1054
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,050
could I have a word
with you for a moment?

1055
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,340
Sure.

1056
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,470
Mom, Dad, I will be just a minute.

1057
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,810
Excuse me.

1058
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,310
That's it. I am eating.

1059
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,350
Didn't he call her a different name?

1060
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:32,860
You have some explaining to do.

1061
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:35,150
First of all, you insult me.

1062
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:38,070
Then you threaten my mother.
You're seeing a married man.

1063
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:42,450
Then I hear you have hung yourself.
And you act like nothing happened.

1064
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:45,160
-What's going on?
-You heard I hung myself?

1065
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,210
Yes.

1066
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:48,790
Eric, why would you say that?

1067
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,920
Let's say a mutual
friend told me he found you.

1068
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,220
Dead.

1069
01:07:54,770 --> 01:08:00,100
-Is this some sort of sick joke?
-He never found me. He found her.

1070
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,720
Her who?

1071
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:08,730
It doesn't even matter anymore.
It's not important.

1072
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:12,070
What's important is my
mom's birthday, and she's here.

1073
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:15,320
I will catch up with you later.
Goodbye.

1074
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,080
Honey, why did he call
you Ms. Newman?

1075
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:26,040
I don't know. Could we just eat?

1076
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:29,290
-I have to go home and pack.
-Can't you cancel?

1077
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,750
We never get a chance to see you.

1078
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,960
I wish I could, but I can't.

1079
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:37,510
-They're very special plans.
-A boy?

1080
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:42,930
-Yes, it's a boy.
-What's his name?

1081
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:45,020
Bobby Starkman.

1082
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:03,160
Bobby?

1083
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,170
-Hey, Jim.
-Dr. Daniels.

1084
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,890
A cup of apricot-peppermint blend?

1085
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,460
Thank. We might have a bit of trouble.

1086
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,800
-Is Harv in?
-He's in the back.

1087
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,550
If it's not Sigmund Freud himself!

1088
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,400
-What's the good word?
-Not much.

1089
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:18,220
I want to file a missing person's
report on Robert Starkman.

1090
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:20,520
-You're kidding?
-I wish I were.

1091
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:24,270
His wife called 20 minutes ago to
do the same thing.

1092
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,820
He didn't show up at his in-laws
upstate like he was supposed to.

1093
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:30,320
-You're kidding?
-I wish I were.

1094
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:33,030
-It's been a crazy year.
-What do you mean?

1095
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,570
It's the third MPR we have filed
this year. Right, Jimmy?

1096
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:39,290
-That's a record around here.
-Who else was there?

1097
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,160
Let's have a look.

1098
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,710
I have got a brand new one here.
A woman, Gerty Fleck,

1099
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,170
from Student Services.
Just up and disappeared.

1100
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,880
And of course, that Newman girl.

1101
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,480
Newman, yeah,
that was seven months ago......

1102
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,180
...A student, Rachael Newman,
disappeared.

1103
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:01,180
The first day of the semester.

1104
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,980
Jimmy and I toddled up on
campus to check it out.

1105
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,980
And guess what?

1106
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:09,940
I am Sheriff Winslow,
and this is Deputy Duncan.

1107
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:12,320
Just looking for a--

1108
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:16,490
-Are you Rachael Newman?
-Yeah. What's wrong?

1109
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,580
We're checking on a MPR on yourself.

1110
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,000
You're not missing, are you?

1111
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,580
No, I am okay.

1112
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:27,580
She was there, unharmed.

1113
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,630
Are you sure
I can't offer you some tea?

1114
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,510
No, thanks, Jim.

1115
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
I actually know
this Rachael Newman girl.

1116
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:37,760
To be honest, I don't trust her.

1117
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:42,350
Are you telling me the parents
just dropped the report?

1118
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,560
I never said nothing about parents.

1119
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,060
The Newman girl,
she was an orphan.

1120
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,560
The report was filed by
some student friends of hers.

1121
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:52,360
-But it was a false alarm.
-How do you know it was her?

1122
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:56,860
There's only one Rachael
Newman registered at school.

1123
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,490
Can I convince you guys
to come to the campus with me

1124
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:05,210
to make sure everything's okay?

1125
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,920
Yeah, no problem, Doc.

1126
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,380
-Should I get in here?
-That's fine.

1127
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:26,060
You're reached Professor Starkman in
the Behavioral Sciences Department.

1128
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,350
Please, leave a message.

1129
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:30,770
Hey, it's me.
I am almost done packing.

1130
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:34,400
I will be there soon.
I hope you're as excited as I am.

1131
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,400
If you need me to go to the store,

1132
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:39,910
I will be here another five minutes.
Otherwise, see you soon.

1133
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,740
I love you. Bye.

1134
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,800
God, you stink.

1135
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,010
Now, how did you get open?

1136
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,300
Trying to sneak out on me?

1137
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,710
I just brought you up and you're
already causing problems.

1138
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,440
Don't fall apart on me now, Rach.

1139
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:17,240
Wow! I like your room.

1140
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,030
Actually,

1141
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,100
I like your name too.

1142
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,190
Rachael.

1143
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,570
You don't mind if I borrow it?

1144
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:29,320
Well, this is a wild-goose chase,
I guess.

1145
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:33,200
-Have a good day.
-You too. Thank you, Officers.

1146
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,870
Hey, Mom, I know I have been
out of touch,

1147
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,830
but I got accepted to West Washington.

1148
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,540
I know. Can you believe it?

1149
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,880
It's so sad about your parents.

1150
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:50,300
That car accident thing and all.
So tragic.

1151
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:53,010
Must have been hard growing
up an orphan.

1152
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:56,770
But, I am glad you shared it with me.

1153
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:15,740
Oh, Bobby.

1154
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,660
I told you to get your beauty sleep.

1155
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:21,040
We have a long night ahead of us.

1156
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,710
You're disgusting.

1157
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:37,970
So, I am two cans of gas and a
brick away from Quantico.

1158
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:42,140
I just have to dot the I's and cross
the T's, and I am home free.

1159
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:45,770
Look out!

1160
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:49,440
-Jesus!
-That was the Newman girl!

1161
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:51,610
We're on the move! Hang on!

1162
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,040
Not now, Bobby.

1163
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:04,210
Wait till we get to the cabin.

1164
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:07,460
I will make you a fire.
I will heat you up real good.

1165
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,350
This qualifies as breaking
the speed limit.

1166
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,140
-Don't you think?
-Doing?

1167
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,890
60...

1168
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,100
-in a 35.
-Yeah.

1169
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,960
She's coming up on Old Mill Bend.
She will slow down for the curve.

1170
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:46,040
-We will take her there.
-Take it easy.

1171
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:49,040
-We don't want anyone getting hurt.
-It's all under control.

1172
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,460
That's 275 bucks.

1173
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:54,510
-Can you pull up next to her?
-Yeah, for a bit.

1174
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:11,690
Jesus!

1175
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:19,620
-Can you do something?
-Yeah. Take the wheel.

1176
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,630
She's slowing down.
That did the trick.

1177
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,340
Doc, you stay here.

1178
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,970
Just be careful. She's a loose cannon.

1179
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,140
It's all part of the job, right?

1180
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:09,950
Ma'am.

1181
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,910
Ma'am, open the door.

1182
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,200
Come on!

1183
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:21,540
Come on, guys. Don't let her get away!

1184
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,770
This don't look good.

1185
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,610
Jesus.

1186
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,620
-What the hell?
-Don't let it be Bobby.

1187
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,370
Christ!

1188
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,580
Bobby.

1189
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,500
How the hell...

1190
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:07,960
Starkman.

1191
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,180
Where the heck is our lady friend?

1192
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,640
Come on.

1193
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:22,640
Bobby.

1194
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,820
Jesus!

1195
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,490
Bobby.

1196
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,090
A bizarre killing spree came to
an end last night

1197
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,920
when 18-year-old West Washington
student Rachael Newman, now identified...

1198
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,760
Rachael Newman's killing spree
is believed to have begun

1199
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:57,050
Wednesday evening with the murder
of Gertrude Fleck...

1200
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:59,060
The body of Cassandra Blair was found

1201
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:01,640
-hanging in her...
-Brian Leeds' body,

1202
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:05,810
-from the Leeds family...
-Keith Lawson was...

1203
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:08,320
The bodies of a West Washington
security guards

1204
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:12,070
-were found within hours...
-Once a typical girl,

1205
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,200
Rachael Newman's death leaves many
questions unanswered.

1206
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:18,450
The most burning question of all: Why?

1207
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:28,880
As a case-study,

1208
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:31,760
Rachael Newman was as rare as they come.

1209
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:34,380
She was more obsessed than Dahmer,

1210
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,470
she was more calculating than Bundy,

1211
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,760
and certainly more faceless than Bateman.

1212
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:43,770
In a perfect world, she'd still be alive.

1213
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,400
But for her, it all ended...

1214
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:49,480
in a blaze of fire

1215
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,230
in which she and her final victim,

1216
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:55,520
a friend of mine, Robert Starkman--

1217
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:58,230
they burned to death.

1218
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:03,150
I wish I had a chance to
study her mind more,

1219
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,910
but all we ended up with
were dental records.

1220
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,030
All in all, she killed eight people.

1221
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,660
Eight people which we know of.

1222
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:17,120
Rachael Newman is one in a billion.

1223
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,630
One in a billion.

1224
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:23,090
She's in a league of her own.

1225
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:27,430
But she will remain a
constant and strong reminder

1226
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,140
that people aren't always
what they seem to be.

1227
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,890
Thanks for taking the time to come out.

1228
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:51,120
-Thank you for coming, Doctor.
-It's a pleasure.

1229
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:54,240
-Who should I make it out to?
-Louis Okon.

1230
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,500
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1231
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,340
-Can I have a different pen?
-Here you go.

1232
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,920
-Who should I make it out to?
-Elizabeth...

1233
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:11,350
-Elizabeth McGuire.
-McGuire.

1234
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,480
Your work is so inspiring.

1235
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:22,060
It's a huge honor to meet you.

1236
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,320
If you could be anyone in the world,

1237
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:27,820
-who would that be?
-Elizabeth McGuire,

1238
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:31,370
Professor Starkman's present TA,
and the next in line for Quantico.

1239
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:37,200
-You can't be?
-What, Eric?

1240
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,960
One in a billion?

1241
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,420
Hello, Dr. Daniels--

1242
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,760
-Do you know that girl?
-Who?

1243
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:54,720
-Elizabeth McGuire.
-You mean, Agent McGuire.

1244
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:57,220
She's the first Quantico
student in history

1245
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,230
to be drafted into the Bureau
in her sophomore year.

1246
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:11,200
Are you all right, Doctor?

1247
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:21,080
It's like they say...

1248
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:24,750
"The brightest futures are
based on forgotten pasts."

1249
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,090
In the end, I did put Dr. Daniels
in a bit of a pickle.

1250
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,380
But you have got to give to take.

1251
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:35,600
He gets his national best-seller,
which is ever so flawed...

1252
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:39,980
I wonder how he sleeps at night,
knowing I still walk the streets.

1253
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,230
Me?

1254
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,400
I need for him to know.

1255
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:46,980
What's the point of pulling off
the perfect set of murders,

1256
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:51,030
to realize my dream,
if there isn't someone alive who knows?

1257
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:56,360
It would be as
if I'd done nothing at all.
