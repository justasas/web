1
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,161
Derek.

2
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:07,076
Fucking pervert, Dan.

3
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,086
What the fuck are you thinking?

4
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:12,083
There's a black guy outside
breaking into your car.

5
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:14,503
How long's he been there?

6
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:15,830
I don't know.

7
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,248
What's going on?

8
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,543
Not right now, honey. How many?

9
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:20,958
Danny, how many?

10
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:22,293
One, I think.

11
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,338
Is he strapped?

12
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:25,634
Does he have a gun?

13
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:27,886
I don'tfucking know.

14
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:31,673
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on?

15
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,931
Stay right here and be quiet.

16
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,965
Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

17
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,396
Stay right here.

18
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,605
I don't have a personal problem
with him.

19
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,898
Don't insult
my intelligence, Murray.

20
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:32,281
You hate this child,
and I think I know why.

21
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,826
Dr. Sweeney's office.

22
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:42,112
I went outwith his mother
afew times.

23
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:44,369
Thatwas three years ago.
Itwas nothing.

24
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:45,826
Nothing. Really?

25
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,123
That paper--
Bob, it's a travesty.

26
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:52,251
Arguingfor Hitler
as a civil rights hero.

27
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,657
You've got to draw the line.

28
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,248
Murray,you actually
did this to yourself.

29
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:57,908
You told them to do a report...

30
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,453
on any book that related to
the struggle for civil rights...

31
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,083
in plain English.

32
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,879
I am not disputing the fact
that the child is confused...

33
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,834
and harbours some sick ideas...

34
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,587
but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

35
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:13,506
His brother probably
put him up to it.

36
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:15,760
I guarantee you 100% ...

37
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,963
his brother did not
put him up to this.

38
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,054
lfind that hard to believe.

39
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:21,759
I know he was a good kid...

40
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,464
and it's a shame what he's been
through, but that's dangerous.

41
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:26,392
Dangerous in whatway?

42
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,262
That goes too far.

43
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:32,094
This racist propaganda,
"Mein Kampf" psychobabble...

44
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:35,515
he learned this nonsense,
and he can unlearn it,too.

45
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,731
I will not give up
on this child yet.

46
00:07:56,198 --> 00:07:57,147
I knew itwas you.

47
00:07:57,616 --> 00:07:59,275
Danny, get in here.

48
00:07:59,742 --> 00:08:01,484
I said get in here!

49
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:02,899
Get in here!

50
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,905
Five,four,three,two...

51
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,160
Shut the door!

52
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,699
What's it gonna be, Danny?

53
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:14,911
What's what gonna be?

54
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,532
This petty crap you're pulling.

55
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:20,783
I don't know.

56
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:22,710
Have a seat.

57
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:29,911
How are you doing?

58
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,793
Fine.

59
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:36,759
Things at home OK?

60
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,681
Derek got out this morning,
did he not?

61
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,218
Yeah, he did.

62
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:51,255
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

63
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:53,136
Honours English.

64
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,886
He was a brilliant student
like you...

65
00:08:57,353 --> 00:09:00,802
but he hung out
with simple-mindedfools...

66
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:02,469
also like you.

67
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,647
Did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

68
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,348
What happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

69
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:11,481
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

70
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:13,567
Ifollowed directions.
I wrote an "A" Paper.

71
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:16,648
"Mein Kampf"?

72
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,144
I should expel you.

73
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:21,938
Go ahead. You don't
think I could handle it?

74
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,233
No. I think the street
would kill you.

75
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,324
Your rhetoric
and your propaganda...

76
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:28,859
aren't going to save you
out there.

77
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,489
So here's the drill.

78
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,404
I'm your history teacher
from now on.

79
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:38,286
We will discuss current events.

80
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:41,499
We will call this class...

81
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,709
American History X.

82
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,705
We meet once a day.

83
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,126
All right.
Yourfirst assignment...

84
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:52,544
is to prepare for me
a new paper due tomorrow.

85
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:56,788
Come on, Sweeney. It took me
a week to read "Mein Kampf."

86
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,220
What do you want me to do it on?

87
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,505
Your brother.

88
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,715
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

89
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:15,174
No. I'm not kidding.

90
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:18,725
I want you to analyse
and interpret all the events...

91
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,429
surrounding
Derek's incarceration.

92
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:24,428
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

93
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:27,563
concerning life
in contemporary America.

94
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:31,770
The impact on your life,
yourfamily's.

95
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,938
Whatever you want to say, Danny.

96
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:42,611
I'll be the only one reading it.

97
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:48,357
But if it's not on my desk
tomorrow morning...

98
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:52,239
you are a ghost
at Venice Beach High.

99
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:54,988
You clear?

100
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:57,909
Yeah, I'm clear.

101
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:04,531
Telling teacher
I'm fuckin' cheatin'!

102
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,741
Is thatwhat's happening?

103
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,159
I never cheated in my life.

104
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,574
Beat his mo'fuckin' ass.

105
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:11,909
I didn't say anything!

106
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:13,705
Why you trippin' on me?

107
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:18,874
Now why you all kicking it
like that?

108
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:20,748
What's up, man?

109
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:24,084
What you scaredfor?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

110
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:32,845
What's up?

111
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:36,470
Want some,too, bitch?
Punk,what's wrong with you?

112
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,390
You want to die?

113
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,843
Punk-ass white boy.

114
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:52,059
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

115
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:55,391
He don'twanna see me
and the heater.

116
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:58,022
Lucky the bell rung.

117
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,976
I would have clocked
thatwhite boy.

118
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:02,979
Punk-ass motherfucker.
Should smoke thatfool.

119
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:06,731
You gottafucking stand up
for yourself.

120
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,077
We got a whole file
on skinheads here.

121
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:25,451
Part of the same gang?

122
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,695
Venice Beach gang.

123
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,329
Actually,
he's done a stretch at Y.A.

124
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,245
This guy C.C., is that him?

125
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,664
Yeah,that's him right there.

126
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,249
This morning we have a guest,
and there he is.

127
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:40,493
Good morning.

128
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:41,744
Morning, sir.

129
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,162
Good to see you.

130
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,413
Good morning.

131
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:46,291
This here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

132
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:48,913
He's principal
over at Venice Beach High.

133
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:51,291
For some time now,
he's been doing outreach work...

134
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,833
with gangs
both in and out of the can.

135
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:56,756
Three years ago, a local kid
named Derek Vinyard...

136
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,927
was sent upfor murdering
a couple of Crips...

137
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:01,261
who were trying to jack his car.

138
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:04,841
Bob taught Vinyard, and
he's followed this case closely.

139
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:07,263
He was a skinhead, right?

140
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:09,764
He was more
like "the" skinhead...

141
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:11,970
the protg
of Cameron Alexander.

142
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:14,557
-Who?
-Cameron Alexander.

143
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,557
Here you go. Have a look-see.

144
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:21,306
Cameron Alexander,well,
he's a Venice Beach landmark.

145
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:23,315
He's the biggest distributor
and writer...

146
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:25,731
of White Power literature
and videos in L.A. County.

147
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:28,896
He promotes White Power bands,
he writes reviews...

148
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:32,029
and in his spare time,this guy
even writes hate columns.

149
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,775
-Does he have a record?
-He's pretty clean.

150
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:37,361
Been trying to pin something
to him, but it doesn'twork.

151
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:40,229
Trust me.
He's behind all of it.

152
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,941
He runs everything
out of his house by the beach.

153
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:45,532
There were no white gangs
in Venice Beach...

154
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,950
before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

155
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,867
Alexanderfound in Derek
his shining prince.

156
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,735
Essentially,
he used Derek to recruit...

157
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:57,788
a slew of insecure,frustrated,
and impressionable kids.

158
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,000
This kid Vinyard,
he's got a lot of baggage...

159
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,372
as you'll see on this tape
we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

160
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:14,122
Earliertoday, L.A. County
fire-fighter Dennis Vinyard...

161
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:16,713
was shot and killed
battling a blaze...

162
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,634
at a suspected Compton drug den.

163
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,468
We're at the Vinyard home now...

164
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,421
and Lieutenant Vinyard's
oldest son Derek...

165
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:24,595
has agreed to talk with us
for a moment.

166
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:28,054
Derek, if you could come
down here please for a second.

167
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:33,139
Look, I know this is tough,
but how do youfeel right now?

168
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,508
How do you think lfeel?

169
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:38,513
-I think it's typical.
-Typical how?

170
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,263
Well,this country's becoming
a haven for criminals...

171
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,643
so what do you expect?

172
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,931
Decent hard-working Americans
like my dad...

173
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:48,936
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

174
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,181
Parasites?

175
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:54,516
Blacks, browns,yellow,
whatever.

176
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:56,183
I don't understand.

177
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:58,278
You think maybe yourfather's
murderwas race-related?

178
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:00,279
Yeah, it's race-related.

179
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:02,197
Every problem in this country
is race-related.

180
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:05,940
Not just crime.
It's immigration,AIDS,welfare.

181
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:08,234
Those are problems
of the black community...

182
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:09,981
the Hispanic community,
the Asian community.

183
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,365
They're notwhite problems.

184
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,866
Aren't those really issues
that deal more with poverty?

185
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:17,696
No. They're not products
of their environments.

186
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:19,574
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

187
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,910
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

188
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,615
Millions of white Europeans
came here andflourished...

189
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,079
within a generation.

190
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:29,370
What the fuck is the matter
with these people?

191
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:31,496
They have to go around
shooting atfiremen.

192
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,535
What does this have to do
with the murder of yourfather?

193
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:37,080
Because my fatherwas murdered
doing his job!

194
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:39,374
Putting out afire in afucking
nigger neighbourhood...

195
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,121
he shouldn't
have given a shit about.

196
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,465
He got shot
by afucking drug dealer...

197
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,048
who probably still collects
a welfare cheque.

198
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:49,001
Derek Vinyard was quietly
releasedfrom Chino...

199
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:52,175
early this morning after serving
three and some odd years.

200
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,129
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

201
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,677
If something happens to him...

202
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:59,809
things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

203
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,547
Just keep it low.

204
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,519
Venice Beach
didn't always look like this.

205
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,266
It used to be
a great neighbourhood.

206
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,271
The boardwalk's always
been a dump...

207
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:12,308
butwhen my dad moved us
out here...

208
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,228
Venice was a nice,
quiet place to grow up.

209
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:19,437
Overthe years,though,
it's just gone to hell.

210
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,444
The gangs are like a plague.

211
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:24,819
They moved westfrom Inglewood
and South Central...

212
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,109
and basically took over.

213
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:27,947
I ain'tfoulin' you!

214
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,116
I ain't got time
for all this bullshit.

215
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:38,657
Fuck y'all.

216
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,866
You all right?

217
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:41,491
I'm all right.

218
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:45,824
Yo, is that thatfool
you was telling me about?

219
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,867
Yeah,that's that motherfucker.

220
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:56,618
Yeah, man,that's him.

221
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,210
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

222
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,418
That's why Derek started
the D.O.C.

223
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:12,588
He said white kids shouldn't
have to walk around scared...

224
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:15,210
in their own neighbourhood,
andfor a while there...

225
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,050
we really made it
like itwas ours again.

226
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,761
Throw the ball!

227
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:22,178
Come on, Curtis!

228
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,515
Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

229
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:27,976
"D" up!

230
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:29,633
Come on, let's go.

231
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:31,967
Look at this
fucking jungle bunny.

232
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:35,105
He does a spin move every time.

233
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,598
You ain't gettin' shit,
motherfucker.

234
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,982
This one's for you, boy!

235
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:43,640
What the fuck you--

236
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,058
Who you callin' boy,
motherfucker?

237
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:47,357
You're lucky, motherfucker!

238
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,480
I'm through monkeying around
with yourfucking ass!

239
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:52,068
Pale, pasty, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker.

240
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,523
A hundred bucks
say I make you my bitch.

241
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,275
Hearthat?
He's trying to make ends meet...

242
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,615
for his cut in welfare.
You're on!

243
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:04,158
It's eight-six, Seth.

244
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,492
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

245
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:09,030
Come on. I can't coverthis.
Help me out here.

246
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:10,494
You got a bigfucking mouth.

247
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,663
I can take this niglet down.

248
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:15,115
You couldn't take a shit.
What are you thinking?

249
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:16,828
I will beat him.
Give me the money.

250
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:18,075
Shut up.

251
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:20,287
You're gonna
fucking embarrass us.

252
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,089
I'll take care of this.

253
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,042
Yo, I ain't got time forthis.

254
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:33,707
Hey!

255
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,046
I got a bet.

256
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:39,834
I come in this game right now.
Same score...

257
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,675
butwe play black guys
against the white guys.

258
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:49,682
Name your price, cracker.

259
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:52,180
No money. Forthese courts.

260
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:54,101
And not just today. For good.

261
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:56,019
If you win,
we will walk away...

262
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:59,976
but if we win,
no bitching, no fighting.

263
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,059
Right here in front of
everybody, pack up your shit...

264
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,065
and get your black asses
out of here.

265
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:06,935
Fuck that. Take this bet.

266
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:08,396
Eight to six. Our ball.

267
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,485
Let's go.

268
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,534
Pick him up!

269
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,572
Seth,
get back and play some "D."

270
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:53,745
Defence!

271
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:04,216
Pass the fucking ball!
I was wide open!

272
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,550
Bullshit.
That's fuckin' offence.

273
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,264
Get out of here.
He moved his feet.

274
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:25,349
You want to go, I'm ready!
Don't throw elbows at me!

275
00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:28,184
You want to go,Adolf Hitler
wannabe motherfucker?

276
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,693
-You OK?
-Yeah. Give me some water.

277
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:43,863
You gotta call offence
on that shit.

278
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:45,602
Not on game point, Danny.

279
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:47,816
You can't let those niggers
get away with that shit.

280
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:49,065
It's game point.

281
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:50,861
Shut 'em down. Kick some ass.

282
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,484
Watch this.

283
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:48,093
Bye-bye.

284
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:49,807
Get the fuck off my court!

285
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:51,054
This is my house!

286
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:52,849
Fuck you, bitch!

287
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,565
Get the fuck out of here!

288
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,405
This is my court!

289
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:20,949
Derek wouldn't let us visit him
in prison.

290
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:23,866
He said itwould make it
just too hardfor him...

291
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:26,998
and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

292
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:30,160
Three years without him,
justwondering.

293
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,908
And then at 7:00 this morning...

294
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:37,949
we picked him up
outside the gate.

295
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:46,835
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

296
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,295
I wanted to stay home,
but he said...

297
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,336
"No. Go to school.
I'll see you later."

298
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,423
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

299
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:10,347
What? You too big
to give me a hug,tough guy?

300
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:12,470
No, man. I just know
you're gonna need someone...

301
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:14,347
to look after you while
you adjust to all this space.

302
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:16,057
Yeah, right.

303
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:19,396
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

304
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:21,054
How you doing? How's school?

305
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,769
It's good.

306
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:24,858
You gotta do something
about that hair.

307
00:23:25,318 --> 00:23:26,230
That do's gotta go.

308
00:23:26,694 --> 00:23:29,018
-The girls like it.
-Well, I don't.

309
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:32,688
You're keeping it pretty close.
You took it all the way down.

310
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,736
Shit. Look. Iforgot, man.

311
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:38,947
It hurt like shit
when they put it on.

312
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:40,865
When'd you get that?

313
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,034
I got it about a month ago.

314
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:45,284
Cameron made it official.

315
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:50,870
He put this on you?

316
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:57,657
What?

317
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,034
Oh, hi. He's here.

318
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:01,912
Derek, it's for you.

319
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:04,168
Nothing.

320
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:07,414
Is there a phone in the back?
I'll get it in the back.

321
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:18,165
I got it. Yeah?

322
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:19,834
Oh, hey.

323
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:23,591
What?

324
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:26,011
My eyes have seen the glory...

325
00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:28,132
of the trampling at the zoo.

326
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,171
We've washed ourselves
in nigger's blood...

327
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,883
and all the mongrels,too.

328
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:36,510
We're taking down
the Zog machine...

329
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:38,685
Jew by Jew by Jew.

330
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,643
The white man marches on.

331
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,058
You think ourfriend
was behind that?

332
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:48,769
I don't even care.

333
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:50,941
I'm gonna take care
of that tonight.

334
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:54,899
My sweet kids. My baby boy.

335
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:58,314
God,what's with
the love fest,you guys?

336
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:06,485
No. He'll do it.
I'll make sure he does it.

337
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,492
I'll get it.

338
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:16,747
I came to see the man.

339
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:20,371
-Can youfit through the door?
-Fuck you!

340
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,491
What's up, Dan? How you doing?

341
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,951
-Where's Derek?
-He's on the phone.

342
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,454
Come out,youfree motherfucker!
Where the fuck are you?

343
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:34,204
Hang on. Give me a minute.

344
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:37,296
I'll be out in a minute.

345
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:52,802
I'll be careful.

346
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:56,598
I'm not gonna stay
in my room the rest of my life.

347
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,339
Hold on.

348
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:01,809
Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

349
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,811
Did you invite him over?

350
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,263
No. He always comes over here.

351
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,938
Danny, give me a minute.

352
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:12,603
Just give me one minute.

353
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,192
Are you still here, Goodyear?

354
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:38,109
You calling me a blimp,
youfucking Democrat?

355
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:43,121
When was the last time you were
actually able to see yourfeet?

356
00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:47,326
Come in here, Danny.

357
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:54,166
Are you going to Cam's party
tonight?

358
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,586
Is Davina's ass watertight?

359
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:58,456
You're fucking sick, man.

360
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:01,626
All right, relax.
Let me ask you afew questions.

361
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:03,750
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework.

362
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:06,753
Tell me some of the shit
you've learned,fuckass...

363
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:08,380
before I pistol-whip you.

364
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:11,511
OK. I believe in death,
destruction...

365
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:13,795
chaos,filth, and greed.

366
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:17,796
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I want to hear.

367
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:20,592
You mean that shit
about your mother?

368
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,844
You want to get
fucking beaten, Danny?

369
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:28,559
I'm notfucking talking to you.
Shut up.

370
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,640
Look,you gotta let me do this
my own way, all right?

371
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:34,766
I'll take care of it.

372
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:36,774
Who do you hate, Danny?

373
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,687
I hate anyone
that isn'twhite Protestant.

374
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:40,933
Why?

375
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:43,524
They're a burden to the
advancement of the white race.

376
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:44,768
Some are all right.

377
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:47,193
None of them
are fucking all right, OK?

378
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:50,523
They're all a bunch
of fuckingfreeloaders.

379
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,780
We don't know 'em.
We don'twant to know 'em.

380
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,485
They're the fucking enemy.

381
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,320
What don't you like
about them...

382
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:00,408
and say itwith
some fucking conviction.

383
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,703
I hate the fact it's cool
to be black these days.

384
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:08,786
I hate this hip-hop influence
on white fucking surburbia.

385
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:10,528
Good.

386
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,698
I hate Tabitha Soren and
her Zionist MTVfucking pigs...

387
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:16,282
telling us we should get along.

388
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:19,502
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

389
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:21,242
'cause it ain't gonna
fucking happen.

390
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:23,420
That's some of the best shit
I've ever heard.

391
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:27,045
lfeel sorry for you, Danny.

392
00:28:27,508 --> 00:28:29,167
You don't believe
any of that shit, right?

393
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:30,415
Shut up.

394
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:33,966
No. Get out of the house now,
you piece of shit.

395
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:36,668
Is that any way to talk
to a guest, afriend?

396
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:38,926
Derek hates you,
and you don't realize it.

397
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:41,593
How do you know who I hate?

398
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:44,889
Back from the dead.
God bless Jesus Christ.

399
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,424
God, I think you lostweight.

400
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,683
I can get my arms almost
all the way around you.

401
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:53,842
Fifty fuckin' pounds, man.
Look at this hair. Holy shit.

402
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:56,802
I told him it's gotta go.

403
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:59,061
Grab your jacket.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

404
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:03,305
I want to talk to him.
One second.

405
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:08,650
Hey, listen. Did you pull
some shit in school today?

406
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:11,444
-Just the usual.
-This kid is awesome as hell.

407
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:14,773
Did you turn in a paper
on "Mein Kampf"?

408
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:18,900
-Sweeney shit his pants.
-He did, man.

409
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,938
Was that your idea or
did Cameron put you up to that?

410
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:24,815
No. I thought itwould be cool.
How'd you know?

411
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:27,028
It doesn't matter how I knew.

412
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:29,452
This kid is smart as hell.

413
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:31,536
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

414
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:33,407
Sweeney called and told me.

415
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,445
God, I hate
thatfucking nigger, man.

416
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,243
He's gotta get afucking life.

417
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:40,782
Sweeney's a good teacher.

418
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:43,077
Sweeney is a nigger
on a powertrip.

419
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:45,167
That's what he was like
when we were there...

420
00:29:45,628 --> 00:29:47,668
and that's how he is now.
It'll never change.

421
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,911
Fuck that nigger!

422
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:50,957
-Seth, go away.
-Are you kidding?

423
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:54,423
Nope. Wait in Danny's room.
I want to talk to my brother.

424
00:29:54,883 --> 00:29:57,634
I've been here 15 minutes.
I'm starving.

425
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:05,378
Come here. Seriously, look.
Forget this yahoo.

426
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,301
He kills bugs for a living.
You don'twant to be like that.

427
00:30:08,764 --> 00:30:09,880
I'm serious. It's notfunny.

428
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:12,306
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn a lotfrom him.

429
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,304
Don't go fuck it up
with smallfry shit like that.

430
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:16,882
You don't understand.

431
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:19,060
You got to see the bullshit
paper he's making me write.

432
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,725
He told me all about it.
I don't care.

433
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,476
You do anything he tells you
to do. I mean it.

434
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:26,563
I don'twant you getting
in trouble in school...

435
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:29,858
trying to impress me,
taking this shit in there.

436
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:31,596
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

437
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:35,518
Yeah, I guess, but, I mean,
I thought you'd be happy.

438
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:37,266
Well, I'm not.

439
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,102
Listen to that.

440
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:44,605
Yeah, I know.
It's been getting worse.

441
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:46,153
Don'tworry about it.

442
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:48,442
I'll talk to you
about this later.

443
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:52,910
She's coughing her lungs out...

444
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:55,612
and you're blowing this
in herface all day.

445
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,910
I'm putting it out.

446
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:00,870
Hey, come on.
I want to talk to you.

447
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,160
Mommy, are you OK?

448
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,415
Put that out.

449
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:18,714
I was just yelling at him
for blowing smoke in yourface.

450
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:21,130
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

451
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:25,087
You all right?

452
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,376
You all right?

453
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:35,547
Look,you got to take it easy.

454
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:37,473
You got to get some rest.

455
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,676
Take Danny's and my room,
and we'll hit the couch.

456
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:42,598
I've been on the couch for ages.
The couch is fine.

457
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,471
No, it's notfine.
This is terrible.

458
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:48,635
We can't live like this.
We gotta get out of here.

459
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:52,599
Can I go with you?

460
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:55,816
Yeah.
We all gotta get out of here.

461
00:31:56,276 --> 00:31:59,524
-I could drop out and get a job.
-Absolutely not.

462
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,941
You got to finish.
I'll work something out.

463
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,857
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

464
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:12,031
Go wait in the living room.

465
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:15,074
I want him out of my house.

466
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:17,077
I know. Look.

467
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,747
He's an idiot.
He's always been an idiot.

468
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:37,617
He can't help it.
I got to do that paper.

469
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:39,829
I'll catch up with you
latertonight.

470
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:43,047
Not at Cameron's. I need you
to stay away from there.

471
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:46,671
-We were going to hang.
-I'll explain it later.

472
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:48,877
I just need you to stay away
from the party, all right?

473
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,374
Whatever.

474
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,797
Promise me you'll stay away
from that party tonight.

475
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,550
I'm notfucking 14 anymore,
all right?

476
00:32:57,805 --> 00:32:59,003
Whatever.

477
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:02,178
God!

478
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:09,934
Come on, let's go.

479
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,433
Where are you parked?

480
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:14,094
Out back.

481
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:24,506
Yeah,that's the whole bunch.

482
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:28,636
It didn't take longfor Derek
to make a name for himself...

483
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:30,842
and Cameron knew
just how to use it.

484
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:32,304
You don'twant to stick around?

485
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:36,385
You know I'd love to,
but I got to be careful.

486
00:34:36,854 --> 00:34:38,429
Yeah, I know.

487
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:41,312
I'll see you back at the house.

488
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:43,596
Good luck.

489
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:47,646
He sent Derek to the kids,
to the frustrated ones...

490
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,484
the ones who were sick
of getting their asses kicked...

491
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:51,982
by black and Mexican gangs.

492
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:54,899
"Don't just be some punk.
Be part of something."

493
00:34:55,364 --> 00:34:57,769
All right, let's go.
Pull it together.

494
00:34:58,238 --> 00:34:59,483
And everybody ate it up.

495
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,355
They did whatever Derek
told them to.

496
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:05,731
Let's go. We're not here
to fucking socialize.

497
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:08,359
Shut the fuck up.

498
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:09,610
Yeah, man.

499
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,358
You want a little toke?

500
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:13,820
Go ahead.

501
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:16,576
-Curtis,what is that?
-Come on, Derek.

502
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,197
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

503
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,449
Jesus fucking Christ.

504
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,411
Have a little self-respect.

505
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:27,868
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

506
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:31,376
There's overtwo million
illegal immigrants...

507
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,245
bedding down
in this state tonight.

508
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,876
This state spent three
billion dollars last year...

509
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:42,212
on services forthose people
who had no right to be here.

510
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:43,840
Three billion dollars.

511
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:48,514
$400 million just to lock up
illegal immigrant criminals...

512
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:52,256
who only got into this country
because the INS decided...

513
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:56,719
it's notworth the effort
to screen for convictedfelons.

514
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:01,092
Our government
doesn't give a shit.

515
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:06,594
Our border policy is a joke,
so is anybody surprised...

516
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,973
that south of the border
they're laughing at us?

517
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:11,349
Laughing at our laws?

518
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:13,061
Every night,thousands
of these parasites...

519
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:15,981
stream across the border like
some fucking piata exploded.

520
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:19,609
Don't laugh.
There's nothingfunny here.

521
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:21,731
This is about your life
and mine.

522
00:36:22,198 --> 00:36:25,315
It's about decent,
hard-working Americans...

523
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:27,193
falling through the cracks
and getting the shaft...

524
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:30,526
because their government
cares more about the rights...

525
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:32,948
of a bunch of people
who aren't even citizens.

526
00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:34,988
On the Statue of Liberty
it says...

527
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:37,694
"Give me yourtired,
your hungry,your poor."

528
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,534
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

529
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,575
Until you take care of that...

530
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,956
close the fucking book,
because we're losing.

531
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:50,244
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

532
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,627
We're losing ourfreedom so
a bunch of fuckingforeigners...

533
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,830
can come in here
and exploit our country.

534
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,083
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

535
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:02,216
This isn't happening places
we can't do anything about it.

536
00:37:02,676 --> 00:37:04,548
It's happening here.
Right in our neighbourhood.

537
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,717
Right in that building
behind you.

538
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:10,295
Archie Miller ran that grocery
store since we were kids here.

539
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,169
Dave worked there.
Mike worked there.

540
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,430
He went under, and now
some fucking Korean owns it...

541
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,094
who fired these guys
and is making a killing...

542
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:21,510
because he hired
40 fucking border jumpers.

543
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:22,889
I see this shit going on...

544
00:37:23,352 --> 00:37:24,893
and I don't see anybody
doing anything about it...

545
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:27,179
and itfucking pisses me off.

546
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:31,310
So look around you.

547
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,471
This isn't
ourfucking neighbourhood.

548
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:36,098
It's a battlefield.
We're on a battlefield tonight.

549
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:37,810
Make a decision.

550
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:40,433
Are we going to stand
on the sidelines?

551
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:43,688
Quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

552
00:37:44,736 --> 00:37:47,523
Are we going to ante up
and do something about it?

553
00:37:48,948 --> 00:37:50,406
You're goddamn right.

554
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:05,320
Come here!
Don't you know it's illegal...

555
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:08,326
to hire fucking border jumpers,
you nip bastard?

556
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,158
Hey, sweetheart.

557
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:19,500
No. You don't need this.
We're not going to hurt you.

558
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,372
Please, please! No!

559
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:25,619
Youfucking spic!

560
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,707
-No! Please!
-This bitch deserves it.

561
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:35,090
This bitch stinks. Smells like
fish and chips and guacamole.

562
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:36,798
Here we go.

563
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:49,677
Goddamn!

564
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:55,348
Get the fuck off me,
motherfucker!

565
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,274
Viva la Mexico!

566
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:11,067
Have afucking bean,
youfucking beaner!

567
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:21,613
Get some of that in there.
Throw it on.

568
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:23,534
That's a great colour on you.

569
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,487
Now you can get
a white woman's job.

570
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,577
A little better
than this one, huh?

571
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:29,282
Yeah,white.

572
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:31,537
Then you'll move up
in the world.

573
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:34,486
Asshole!

574
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,239
Let's go!

575
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,787
Everybody out!

576
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,792
Now! Now!

577
00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:45,205
All right, let's go!

578
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:46,667
Come on!

579
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,754
Come on, let's go.

580
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,131
No green card, no fucking work.
Comprende?

581
00:39:59,678 --> 00:40:00,460
Come on!

582
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:02,837
We're fucking going! Come on!

583
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:32,559
Dad was gone, but things
were almost normal again.

584
00:40:33,028 --> 00:40:34,272
Derek had a good job.

585
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:36,195
Mom was starting
to live a little.

586
00:40:36,654 --> 00:40:40,353
Everyone was feeling so good,
we just didn't see it coming.

587
00:40:40,823 --> 00:40:42,282
Maybe we should've.

588
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:44,485
The irony is
that most of the stores...

589
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,238
destroyed during the riots
were owned by black people.

590
00:40:47,701 --> 00:40:50,404
That's stupid,though.
Why trash your neighbourhood?

591
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:53,406
Well,that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

592
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:55,412
It's like an expression
of rage...

593
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:59,453
by people who feel neglected
and turned away by the system.

594
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:05,155
It's like we had in Watts
orthe riots in Chicago in '68.

595
00:41:05,626 --> 00:41:06,658
I don't buy that.

596
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:09,285
Calling a riot an irrational
expression of rage.

597
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:12,160
That's such a cop-out.
It's opportunism at its worst.

598
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,289
It's people grabbing
any excuse they can find...

599
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:16,297
to go and loot a store,
nothing more.

600
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:18,499
The fact that these people
ripped off the stores...

601
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:20,543
in their own communities,
all that reflects...

602
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:23,463
is that they have no respect
forthe law at all...

603
00:41:23,927 --> 00:41:26,299
and certainly no concept
of community...

604
00:41:26,762 --> 00:41:27,877
or civic responsibility.

605
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:29,176
Now wait a minute.

606
00:41:29,638 --> 00:41:31,595
White people commit crimes
againstwhite people,too.

607
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,222
Yeah, but they're not offing
each other in record numbers.

608
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:37,224
Look at the statistics,
for Christ's sake.

609
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:39,307
One in every three
black males...

610
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,678
is in some phase
of the correctional system.

611
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:43,223
Is that a coincidence...

612
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:45,892
or do these people have
a racial commitment to crime?

613
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:48,312
Not only that.
They're proud of it.

614
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,147
Maybe it says something
about prejudice...

615
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:51,555
in the judicial system.

616
00:41:52,024 --> 00:41:53,933
If you want to talk
about criminal statistics...

617
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:57,316
take a look at the social
inequalities that produce them.

618
00:41:57,777 --> 00:41:59,520
That's exactly what I hate.

619
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:02,654
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

620
00:42:03,113 --> 00:42:05,188
and just alleviating
the responsibility...

621
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:06,687
these people have
fortheir own actions.

622
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,239
It's like saying,
it's not a riot, it's rage.

623
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:13,699
It's not crime, it's poverty.
That's just nonsense.

624
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,654
It's exactly what happened
in this trial...

625
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,398
because the media
twisted things around...

626
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,028
so people got allfocused
on these cops...

627
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,659
and whether or not they were
going to get convicted...

628
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,694
and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

629
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:27,038
Everybody lost sight
of old Rodney King himself.

630
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,119
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

631
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:31,994
He's high as a goddamn kite...

632
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:34,667
driving 120 miles an hour
down the highway.

633
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:36,706
He gets pulled over
by a bunch of cops...

634
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:38,250
and he attacks them.

635
00:42:38,713 --> 00:42:39,496
He attacked police officers.

636
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:41,127
That's the bottom line,
and he walked.

637
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:43,333
And there's some yahoo there
with a video camera...

638
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:44,830
who turned it on
halfway through...

639
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:47,256
so that all we see
is them hitting him.

640
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:50,882
You got Powell and Koon
cracking him with billy clubs...

641
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:53,218
and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull...

642
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,545
so it looks severe,you know?

643
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:55,962
People are going,
"Oh,this poor guy."

644
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,972
This poor guy
who attackedfour cops...

645
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,890
and those cops
end up on the stand...

646
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:04,427
defending themselves for using
standard textbook procedures.

647
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:06,601
I don't think the tapes
showed that at all.

648
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:09,765
You didn't think so?
And you're an authority?

649
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,516
Murray,what do you think?

650
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:17,688
I did think the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

651
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,348
Who are you
to say what's excessive?

652
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:21,228
I think itwas
totally appropriate.

653
00:43:21,693 --> 00:43:24,362
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

654
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,151
We, as society, grant cops
a certain amount of authority...

655
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:30,189
to make those calls,
because we acknowledge...

656
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:32,481
that their job is difficult
and dangerous.

657
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:36,315
Very few people respect that
and respect that authority.

658
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:39,274
Look who's talking about
respect--Mr. Junior KKK.

659
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:40,988
What?

660
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,530
You want to go to college?
Learn to listen.

661
00:43:44,996 --> 00:43:47,949
I didn't say I respect the laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

662
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:51,449
I don't respect laws that let
Rodney King back on the street.

663
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:54,833
Second, I am not a member
of a low-rent...

664
00:43:55,293 --> 00:43:59,122
disorganized bunch of rednecks
like the fucking KKK. Please.

665
00:43:59,587 --> 00:44:01,874
So take your head
out of your ass.

666
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:03,665
You've gotten off the point.

667
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,169
I had a point.
Thatwasn't even the point.

668
00:44:06,632 --> 00:44:08,125
Do you have one?
What is your point?

669
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:10,132
All right,think about this.

670
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:12,549
If Danny was walking
across the street that night...

671
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:13,839
and Rodney King
plowed into him--

672
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:16,377
Can we drop
this Rodney King thing?

673
00:44:26,184 --> 00:44:27,641
Who would like some dessert?

674
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:30,466
We're having a discussion.

675
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,643
We're having
a nice discussion, right?

676
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,217
If Rodney King
had been driving along...

677
00:44:34,688 --> 00:44:36,228
hopped up on PCP
and had killed Danny...

678
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:37,684
you'd be singing
a different tune--

679
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:40,684
I didn't see him hit anybody,
and neither did you.

680
00:44:41,149 --> 00:44:43,270
He didn't happen
to kill anybody,thank God.

681
00:44:43,733 --> 00:44:46,306
Keep it down, OK?
Ally's sleeping.

682
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:52,354
If thatfucking monkey
had run some kid over...

683
00:44:52,821 --> 00:44:55,690
everybody would have
a very different opinion.

684
00:44:56,156 --> 00:44:59,024
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

685
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,116
But instead,
he just attacked afew cops...

686
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:02,820
so, suddenly,
it's Hands Across America...

687
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,861
forthis fucking total
son of a bitch.

688
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,275
It blows my mind.

689
00:45:06,744 --> 00:45:09,150
We're so hung up on this notion
thatwe have some obligation...

690
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:11,280
to help
this struggling black man.

691
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:13,619
Cut him some slack
until he can overcome...

692
00:45:14,082 --> 00:45:15,077
these historical injustices.

693
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,497
It's crap. This stuff
just perpetuates it...

694
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:19,156
all this liberal nonsense.

695
00:45:19,626 --> 00:45:20,539
Everyone's looking
the otherway...

696
00:45:21,002 --> 00:45:22,577
while our country rots
from the inside out.

697
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:26,209
I mean, Christ, Lincoln freed
the slaves 130 years ago.

698
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,295
How long does it take
to get your act together?

699
00:45:28,755 --> 00:45:32,371
Jews have been persecuted
for over 5,000 years.

700
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,832
Are you saying it's wrong
to feel sensitive...

701
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,081
about anti-Semitism?

702
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,499
Oh,forget that.

703
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,636
I'm with you. I'm with you
all the way, baby.

704
00:45:41,095 --> 00:45:42,422
I'm so sick of
these liberal hypocrites.

705
00:45:42,886 --> 00:45:44,464
Here we go again.
I love this part.

706
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:45,712
This is great.

707
00:45:46,181 --> 00:45:47,674
Look how they scapegoated
Chief Gates.

708
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,261
Think they would've come down
that hard on Willie Williams?

709
00:45:50,724 --> 00:45:53,758
No way. That videotape was
a set-up to get rid of Gates.

710
00:45:54,227 --> 00:45:57,178
-Can I be excused?
-No. Don't interrupt.

711
00:45:57,644 --> 00:45:59,553
Excuse me. I was talking.
I listened to you.

712
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,138
-Who do you think you are?
-She's making a point.

713
00:46:03,604 --> 00:46:05,513
Davina, sit down.

714
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:08,898
Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!

715
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,107
-Derek, calm down.
-Don't tell him to shut up!

716
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,188
Sit your ass down. No.
Sit down. Shut your mouth.

717
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:17,775
Move! Goddamn it! Move!

718
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:20,145
Shut your mouth and give
my girlfriend respect.

719
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:22,486
Derek,what are you
trying to prove?

720
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:24,110
Murray, stay out of it!

721
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,316
Where do you think you're going?

722
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,155
Derek, let her go!

723
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:32,784
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina!

724
00:46:33,245 --> 00:46:35,035
Shut yourfucking mouth!

725
00:46:35,496 --> 00:46:36,693
Stop!

726
00:46:37,955 --> 00:46:39,200
She can't breathe!

727
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:41,947
Let her go!

728
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,324
You going to apologize?

729
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:49,535
You're afucking asshole.
I hate you!

730
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:01,173
What are you doing?
This is yourfamily.

731
00:47:01,633 --> 00:47:03,091
Right.
My family, so you know what?

732
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,586
I don't give two shits about you
orwhat you think.

733
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:08,380
You're not a part of it.

734
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:10,920
-That has nothing to do with it.
-It doesn't?

735
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:12,763
You don't think
I see what you're doing?

736
00:47:13,223 --> 00:47:14,254
You think
I'll sit here and smile...

737
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:16,927
while some fucking kike
tries to fuck my mother?

738
00:47:17,392 --> 00:47:19,881
It's never going to happen.
Fuckingforget it.

739
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:21,726
Notwhile I'm in this family.

740
00:47:22,185 --> 00:47:23,808
I willfucking cut
your Shylock nose off...

741
00:47:24,269 --> 00:47:26,558
and stick it up your ass
before I let that happen.

742
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:29,178
Coming in here and poisoning
my family's dinner...

743
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:32,731
with yourJewish,
nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.

744
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,896
Fuck you. Fuck you.

745
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:40,689
Yeah,walk out.

746
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:43,144
Asshole. Fucking
cabala-reading motherfucker.

747
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:45,235
Get out of my house.

748
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:52,440
You see this?
That means notwelcome.

749
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:05,946
What did I do?

750
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,909
You disgust me.

751
00:48:08,374 --> 00:48:10,532
Bring him to ourtable, primping
your hair and your dress.

752
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:12,874
What did I do?

753
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:14,829
You're all tarted up.

754
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:16,491
How could you bring him
to my father's table?

755
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,796
How could you go from Dad
to that? Aren't you ashamed?

756
00:48:20,255 --> 00:48:23,503
I'm ashamed that you
came out of my body!

757
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,883
Go run to yourfucking kike!
Run to him!

758
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:38,929
It's OK.
I'm proud of you, baby.

759
00:48:45,643 --> 00:48:49,305
I'm so sorry, Doris.
I really am.

760
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,221
He's gone.

761
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:03,017
He's just a boy
without afather.

762
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:07,267
Doris,you don't know the world
your children are living in.

763
00:49:17,158 --> 00:49:18,699
Good-bye.

764
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:05,675
Hey,you all right?

765
00:50:08,516 --> 00:50:11,053
-Take this,youfucking dick!
-No. Come here.

766
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:12,596
-Fuck you!
-Calm down.

767
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:14,009
-Let go of me!
-Calm down.

768
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:15,259
Let me go, God damn it!

769
00:50:15,728 --> 00:50:17,850
-Fuck you!
-I'm sorry.

770
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:21,436
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

771
00:50:21,898 --> 00:50:25,016
I screwed up. I lost control.
It's not you.

772
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:28,234
I'm sorry.
I'd never hurt you guys.

773
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:31,064
You know that.
I'd do anythingfor you.

774
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:32,309
I don't believe you.

775
00:50:32,778 --> 00:50:35,102
I trust you, Derek.

776
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,030
What are you doing out of bed?
Want a plane ride?

777
00:50:49,494 --> 00:50:52,411
-Yeah.
-Goingfortakeoff.

778
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,167
Oh, no, don't crash.

779
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:04,867
Better go to Mom.
She's a crazy flier.

780
00:51:05,336 --> 00:51:08,288
Kiss Mom. Oh,yeah.

781
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:19,757
-You don'tfeel too hot.
-No. It's my chest.

782
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,256
-What are you up to?
-I'm just thinking.

783
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,840
Yeah? There's a lot of that
going around.

784
00:51:25,304 --> 00:51:27,710
I don't even know
how we got here sometimes.

785
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:30,504
lfeel like I let you down, only
I didn't know when it happened.

786
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:32,551
Mom, it's OK.

787
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:38,095
It's cold in here.
No wonder you're sick.

788
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:40,885
You don't get sick from cold.
You get sick from germs.

789
00:51:41,353 --> 00:51:44,021
No. You get sick from smoking.

790
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,727
You ought to quit.
It's not goodfor you.

791
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,024
What are you looking at me
like thatfor?

792
00:51:56,485 --> 00:51:59,355
When are you going to let
that beautiful hair grow back?

793
00:52:01,197 --> 00:52:03,187
The day you quit smoking.

794
00:52:06,282 --> 00:52:07,362
Deal.

795
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:12,070
I'd better get Ally to bed.
You say good night to Mom?

796
00:52:12,535 --> 00:52:14,278
Then you have to go to bed.
Come on.

797
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:17,316
-Good night, Mama.
-Good night, baby.

798
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:54,714
I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

799
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,924
I try to stop itfrom happening.

800
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:58,932
I want you out of this house.

801
00:52:59,392 --> 00:53:01,299
That's fine.
I'll be gone in the morning.

802
00:53:02,767 --> 00:53:04,096
He can move in with me.

803
00:53:05,353 --> 00:53:07,262
In my mind, I imagine
whatwould've happened...

804
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:11,178
if I hadn't gone to that room
and told him.

805
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,637
Get down!

806
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,262
No, Derek!

807
00:53:17,983 --> 00:53:20,271
Help, Mommy!

808
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:37,199
Nigger,you justfucked
with the wrong bull. Come here!

809
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,442
Damn!

810
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:41,945
Should've learned your place on
the fucking basketball court...

811
00:53:42,412 --> 00:53:44,036
but youfucking monkeys
never get the message!

812
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,661
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

813
00:53:48,123 --> 00:53:51,288
You ever shoot atfiremen?
You shoot at my family?

814
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:53,789
I'm going to teach you a real
lesson now, motherfucker.

815
00:53:54,252 --> 00:53:55,661
Put yourfucking mouth
on the kerb.

816
00:53:56,127 --> 00:53:56,909
Hold on, man.

817
00:53:57,378 --> 00:54:00,331
Put it on the kerb right now!

818
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,454
That's it.

819
00:54:04,923 --> 00:54:06,583
Derek, no!

820
00:54:11,134 --> 00:54:12,628
Now say good night.

821
00:54:25,392 --> 00:54:26,590
Fucker.

822
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,721
Drop yourweapon!
Put yourweapon on the ground!

823
00:54:36,187 --> 00:54:37,730
Put your hands up!

824
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:41,557
I said get your hands up!
Now turn around!

825
00:54:50,737 --> 00:54:53,310
Put your hands behind your head!

826
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,065
Get down on your knees
right now!

827
00:55:56,645 --> 00:56:00,511
It's all right.

828
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,678
Let's go.

829
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:08,358
-Come on.
-No.

830
00:56:15,903 --> 00:56:16,983
She ain't gonna open the door?

831
00:56:17,446 --> 00:56:19,771
Someone rightfucking there
looking at us. Hello?

832
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:21,697
Danny, it's for you.

833
00:56:22,781 --> 00:56:24,573
Be right there.

834
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:40,362
Open the door, Danny.
It's fuckingfreezing!

835
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:42,373
Danny, I'm gonna be sick!

836
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:46,036
Come on, Danny!

837
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,802
I'm gonna go get some beers.

838
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,683
Hey,what a party,fatso?

839
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,482
I'm notfat, asshole!
I'm husky!

840
00:57:36,943 --> 00:57:38,520
What the fuck's up, Seth?

841
00:57:38,986 --> 00:57:40,610
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

842
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:41,983
Holy fuck, he's here!

843
00:57:42,446 --> 00:57:45,232
Yeah, he's fucking here.
Go pay your respects.

844
00:57:45,698 --> 00:57:46,896
Fuck you, Seth!

845
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:51,440
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

846
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:53,284
-Father Vinyard?
-How's it going?

847
00:57:53,743 --> 00:57:56,030
I'm Jason,this is Chris.
We're friends with your brother.

848
00:57:56,495 --> 00:57:59,244
You are afucking god, man!

849
00:58:17,421 --> 00:58:18,879
I thought you turned
that paper in.

850
00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:21,663
I did. Now fucking Murray
turned me in...

851
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:25,381
so Sweeney's making me
write another one.

852
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:29,837
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying.

853
00:58:30,303 --> 00:58:32,839
He's one of those
"proud to be nigger" people.

854
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:34,383
I hate those guys.

855
00:58:34,846 --> 00:58:37,632
Wait a minute, Danny.
He's not proud.

856
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:43,007
No. He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

857
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:46,310
He's making youfeel guilty
aboutwriting on Adolf Hitler.

858
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:51,559
Some nigger, some spic writes
about Martin Luther King...

859
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:58,695
orfucking Cesar commie Chavez
gets a pat on the head.

860
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:00,910
Yeah.

861
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:04,542
You can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

862
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:06,201
Definitely.

863
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:11,835
Come on, let's go.

864
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,669
No. Listen. Wait.

865
00:59:15,132 --> 00:59:16,674
I want to see you, OK?

866
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:20,133
I do, but I gotta
take care of something tonight.

867
00:59:22,052 --> 00:59:24,341
-OK.
-You understand?

868
00:59:24,805 --> 00:59:28,005
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

869
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:34,049
-Would you do something with me?
-Anything.

870
00:59:34,518 --> 00:59:36,094
Leave with me.

871
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,552
Leave where?

872
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:42,469
Leave here. Leave all this.
Just come with me.

873
00:59:42,938 --> 00:59:44,515
Why would you want to leave?

874
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,356
They worship you.
You're like a god to them.

875
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,731
If we had it good before,wait
till you see what it's like now.

876
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:53,476
I don'twant all that.
I don'twant my family involved.

877
00:59:53,944 --> 00:59:56,018
Everything I've done here
fucked it all up, understand?

878
00:59:56,487 --> 00:59:58,063
You think what you did
was wrong?

879
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:00,983
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

880
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:03,569
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

881
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:05,940
and we all know that.

882
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:09,110
I understand you just got out,
but no one's gonna hurt you.

883
01:00:09,576 --> 01:00:11,484
No one can touch you.
There's a small army out there.

884
01:00:11,952 --> 01:00:14,324
We're not gonna let
a bunch of spooks kick us out.

885
01:00:14,787 --> 01:00:16,446
You're not listening to me.
I'm not scared.

886
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:18,821
I don'twant it anymore.

887
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:22,406
I'm done with it.
I'm through with this.

888
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:27,498
It's bullshit, Stacey.

889
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:31,996
You don't need this, Stacey.
Come on,trust me.

890
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,873
If you want to be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

891
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:37,117
Come on.

892
01:00:37,588 --> 01:00:40,669
You're nuts. You are nuts.
No way.

893
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:43,833
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

894
01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:47,582
We are 10 times whatwe were,
and we are bloody organized.

895
01:00:48,049 --> 01:00:50,172
It is like nothing
you have ever seen.

896
01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:51,962
This was a mistake. Forget it.

897
01:00:52,428 --> 01:00:54,502
Wait a second.
Whatwas a mistake?

898
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:56,796
Stacey,just say good-bye.

899
01:00:57,262 --> 01:00:59,753
This isn't you. I know you.

900
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,048
You don't know anything
about me, Stacey.

901
01:01:09,852 --> 01:01:12,009
-Are you Danny's brother?
-Yeah.

902
01:01:12,479 --> 01:01:15,098
Will you tell him
Lizzy's lookingfor him?

903
01:01:15,562 --> 01:01:17,436
Thank you.

904
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:22,558
We'll let the niggers, kikes,
and spics grab forthe pie.

905
01:01:23,025 --> 01:01:24,816
Can't blame 'em.

906
01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:27,648
Course,they're gonna
have to fight to get it.

907
01:01:29,445 --> 01:01:31,982
And if we scare
the fuck out of people...

908
01:01:32,448 --> 01:01:36,028
and afew people get killed
in the process, so be it.

909
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,648
Gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

910
01:01:39,117 --> 01:01:41,321
Hey, man.

911
01:01:41,784 --> 01:01:45,828
Well, look who's here.
The return of the soldier.

912
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:47,828
What are you doing here, Danny?

913
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,825
Come on, man.
I had to check it out.

914
01:01:51,289 --> 01:01:52,368
You knew I was gonna come.

915
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:56,495
Let the kid alone, Derek.
He knows when to go to bed.

916
01:01:58,542 --> 01:01:59,373
Go wait outside.

917
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:01,707
Come on, Der.
I'm not doing anything.

918
01:02:02,169 --> 01:02:05,168
This little blonde girl
keeps askingfor you.

919
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:06,957
She's dying. Come on.

920
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:09,544
-I gotta check out.
-Go easy on her.

921
01:02:10,006 --> 01:02:11,879
All right.

922
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:17,259
Waitfor me right outside.

923
01:02:22,304 --> 01:02:23,929
Take it easy.

924
01:02:24,389 --> 01:02:26,464
Chill out.

925
01:02:26,932 --> 01:02:28,970
You're on safe ground.

926
01:02:29,433 --> 01:02:32,052
You don't have to watch
your ass around here.

927
01:02:33,477 --> 01:02:35,384
Come on. Sit down. Relax.

928
01:02:37,396 --> 01:02:40,015
I'm sorry.
The party was a little quick...

929
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,147
butwe're just so damn glad
you're back, Derek.

930
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:45,266
It's only natural
you shouldfeel a little funny.

931
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:46,846
I don'tfeelfunny, Cam.

932
01:02:47,316 --> 01:02:49,641
You made the fat kid
a little nervous.

933
01:02:50,109 --> 01:02:51,603
He thinks the joint
messed with your mind.

934
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,397
It did.

935
01:03:00,573 --> 01:03:04,272
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

936
01:03:04,742 --> 01:03:08,951
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

937
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,410
The white man marches on!

938
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:15,621
Things have changed
since you've been gone.

939
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,953
You talk about organization?

940
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:20,822
Wait'll you see what
we've done with the internet.

941
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:22,832
We've got every gang
from Seattle to San Diego...

942
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:24,407
working together now.

943
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:26,833
Not competing anymore.
They're consolidated.

944
01:03:27,294 --> 01:03:29,370
Only thing we lack is
a little overall leadership.

945
01:03:29,837 --> 01:03:32,588
That's where you come in.

946
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:35,667
Those people out there got
a lot of respectfor you.

947
01:03:36,132 --> 01:03:37,839
When you're ready,
come talk to me about it.

948
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,748
You can forget about that.
I'm done with it, Cam.

949
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:45,384
Yeah,well,
I know you grew out of...

950
01:03:45,846 --> 01:03:48,880
that shaved head bullshit
a long time ago,thank God.

951
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:50,805
I like your hair
the way it is now.

952
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:53,885
See,that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

953
01:03:54,349 --> 01:03:55,594
No more of this fucking
grocery store--

954
01:03:56,058 --> 01:03:57,517
You're not listening to me.
I am done with it.

955
01:03:57,976 --> 01:03:59,802
All that bullshit out there
and all your bullshit,too.

956
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,465
I'm out.

957
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:04,722
I understand how youfeel.
You've just done hard time.

958
01:04:05,188 --> 01:04:06,978
Don't youfucking talk to me
about hard time.

959
01:04:07,438 --> 01:04:09,016
-You don't know anything.
-I've done mine.

960
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:11,520
You didn't do shit.
Ifound out about you.

961
01:04:11,983 --> 01:04:13,525
You did two months,
then rolled over on two kids...

962
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:15,525
and let them go down for you.

963
01:04:15,984 --> 01:04:17,893
So don'tfeed me
yourfucking lies, Cameron.

964
01:04:19,612 --> 01:04:22,729
All right. This is stupid.
I'm done.

965
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:25,402
You go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

966
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:28,189
Get your head on straight,
and then I'll talk to you.

967
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:30,364
But it doesn't matter
if I don't, does it?

968
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,368
'Cause you got the next crop...

969
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,201
lined up and ready to go,
youfucking chicken hawk.

970
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,071
Excuse me?

971
01:04:36,536 --> 01:04:38,861
You prey on people, Cam!
You use them!

972
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,818
I lost three years of my life
for yourfucking phoney cause...

973
01:04:42,289 --> 01:04:43,831
but I am on to you now,
youfucking snake.

974
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:47,953
Derek,watch it. Be careful.
Rememberwhere you are.

975
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:51,582
This isn't some fucking country
club you can waltz in and out--

976
01:04:52,045 --> 01:04:53,371
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

977
01:04:53,837 --> 01:04:56,291
I came here to tell you
one thing. I am out.

978
01:04:56,754 --> 01:04:58,212
Out! And Danny is out,too!

979
01:04:58,673 --> 01:05:00,581
If you come near my family,
I'llfucking kill you.

980
01:05:01,048 --> 01:05:03,040
Excuse me, butfuck you, Derek.

981
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:05,417
You can't come
barking threats at me.

982
01:05:05,885 --> 01:05:08,338
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

983
01:05:08,802 --> 01:05:10,794
He's not some whiny pussy
like you.

984
01:05:11,262 --> 01:05:12,804
He needs my help,
and I'm gonna give it to him.

985
01:05:13,263 --> 01:05:15,170
If you come near Danny again...

986
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:17,430
I willfeed you
yourfucking heart, Cameron.

987
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:23,261
I won't have to.
He'll come to me.

988
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:25,967
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

989
01:05:30,062 --> 01:05:30,892
Shit.

990
01:05:31,355 --> 01:05:34,353
You're afucking dead man,
Vinyard.

991
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:53,820
Hey,where's Cameron?
Where the fuck is he?

992
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,693
Stay away from me, Stacey.
Danny!

993
01:05:58,159 --> 01:05:59,701
Why don't you share
with the rest of us...

994
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,278
what you just said to me,
you piece of shit nigger!

995
01:06:03,746 --> 01:06:05,619
You monkey-fucking traitor!

996
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,324
You afucking nigger-fucker?

997
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:09,330
Hey, Danny! Come on!

998
01:06:09,789 --> 01:06:11,781
He's afucking nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!

999
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,739
Cam's out cold!
Where the fuck are you going?

1000
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:16,750
Gun! He's got a gun!

1001
01:06:17,211 --> 01:06:19,581
Shit! Back up!

1002
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:22,753
You make me fucking sick!

1003
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:25,621
Put down the fucking gun!

1004
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:26,954
Shoot the nigger!

1005
01:06:27,424 --> 01:06:30,791
Shoot him!
Do it, Seth! Shoot him!

1006
01:06:31,259 --> 01:06:32,836
Traitor!

1007
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:34,759
Do it, Seth! Do it!

1008
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:39,720
Back up! Move!

1009
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:43,756
Back up! Back the fuck up!

1010
01:06:44,224 --> 01:06:46,180
Move! Move!

1011
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:47,885
Easy, Derek! Hey!

1012
01:07:09,528 --> 01:07:10,309
Easy, Danny!

1013
01:07:10,779 --> 01:07:12,272
Who do you think you are?

1014
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:15,274
-Danny, relax.
-Who do you think you are?

1015
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:17,695
Take it easy, Dan.

1016
01:07:18,157 --> 01:07:19,816
lfucking hate you, Der!

1017
01:07:20,283 --> 01:07:21,692
All right. I mean it.

1018
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:23,320
Huh?

1019
01:07:23,784 --> 01:07:25,823
Come on. Shut up.
Take it easy.

1020
01:07:26,286 --> 01:07:27,779
What's happened to you, Der?

1021
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:30,284
Take it easy.

1022
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:33,117
What's happened to you, Der?

1023
01:07:41,251 --> 01:07:43,872
Come on. Come on.

1024
01:07:47,045 --> 01:07:48,837
It's just so fucked.

1025
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:51,788
I'm sorry. You weren't
supposed to see that.

1026
01:07:52,257 --> 01:07:53,039
I told you not to come.

1027
01:07:53,507 --> 01:07:55,748
Fuck you, man.

1028
01:07:56,216 --> 01:07:57,296
Thatwas so fucked up.

1029
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,799
I know, I know.

1030
01:08:00,261 --> 01:08:02,667
God, itwasn't supposed
to happen thatway.

1031
01:08:03,137 --> 01:08:05,888
Thatwas fucked up.
That's all there is to it.

1032
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:09,631
That's notwhat I planned.
It just all went to shit.

1033
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:13,881
Just shit.
Got totally out of control.

1034
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:18,102
What's fucking happening here?

1035
01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:24,182
Hey, look at me.

1036
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,597
I can't go back to that, Dan.

1037
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,810
Can't go back to what?

1038
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:33,935
To any of it.

1039
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:37,106
Those guys,the gang,that life.
I'm done with it.

1040
01:08:41,155 --> 01:08:42,649
What happened to you up there?

1041
01:08:50,536 --> 01:08:52,195
Feed line. Back upfor chow.

1042
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:54,119
Don't be late,
you piece of shit!

1043
01:08:54,578 --> 01:08:58,111
Let's go if you want to eat!
Get up! Five minutes!

1044
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:00,536
This is my fucking house!
Get up!

1045
01:09:00,999 --> 01:09:02,906
What the fuck's your problem,
you assholes?

1046
01:09:03,376 --> 01:09:06,209
Move! Let's go!
Open the fucking gates!

1047
01:09:06,668 --> 01:09:09,038
All right, rack 'em!

1048
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:15,379
Five minutes! Stepforward!

1049
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,045
Those beds better be made.

1050
01:09:20,758 --> 01:09:23,248
Aftertwo days, I didn't think
I'd make it a week.

1051
01:09:23,718 --> 01:09:25,426
Come on,you motherfuckers!

1052
01:09:25,886 --> 01:09:27,676
You want to eat today,
youfucking piece of shit?

1053
01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:29,714
Hey,you white trash

1054
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:31,638
You think you're
fucking special,whitefish?

1055
01:09:32,098 --> 01:09:34,883
Button that top button!
Let's go! Move!

1056
01:09:35,348 --> 01:09:38,219
Are you eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole!

1057
01:09:38,684 --> 01:09:40,759
I'llfucking kill you!

1058
01:09:41,226 --> 01:09:44,096
I'm gonna keep my eye on you,

1059
01:09:46,063 --> 01:09:48,635
Don'tfucking eyeball me, boy!
I'llfucking skull-fuck you!

1060
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:51,014
Stepforward!

1061
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:53,429
Turn to the left.

1062
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,478
Stepforward to chow! Let's go!

1063
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,900
Come on!
Hey,fish, straight ahead.

1064
01:10:01,361 --> 01:10:03,354
Straight ahead,fucker!
Let's go!

1065
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:06,524
All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway...

1066
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:10,154
so lfigured I'd put up aflag
and hope afriend sees it.

1067
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,396
That's the cat I'm talking
about right there.

1068
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:36,192
Boss.

1069
01:11:36,658 --> 01:11:38,117
Have a seat.

1070
01:11:39,118 --> 01:11:40,314
It's a pleasure.

1071
01:11:50,832 --> 01:11:52,408
Don'tfuck with me, all right?

1072
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,701
'Cause I'm the most dangerous
man in this prison.

1073
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:59,079
You know why?
'Cause I control the underwear.

1074
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:09,668
We pick 'em up over here,
and we store 'em overthere.

1075
01:12:10,132 --> 01:12:11,675
And I hope you work out,
all right?

1076
01:12:12,134 --> 01:12:14,588
'Cause the last guy they sent me
didn'twear no drawers...

1077
01:12:15,051 --> 01:12:16,794
couldn't read
the sizes in the drawers...

1078
01:12:17,261 --> 01:12:19,052
and used to sniff
the drawers, all right?

1079
01:12:19,512 --> 01:12:21,551
We got two sizes--medium
and large, all right?

1080
01:12:22,013 --> 01:12:23,970
All you gotta do is put
the mediums with the mediums...

1081
01:12:24,431 --> 01:12:25,545
and the larges with
the larges, all right?

1082
01:12:26,015 --> 01:12:27,556
I know it's a boring job...

1083
01:12:28,016 --> 01:12:29,842
but it's betterthan that
last shit they had me doing.

1084
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:33,759
I spent two years in the kitchen
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1085
01:12:34,227 --> 01:12:36,682
That you don'twanna do,
all right?

1086
01:12:37,146 --> 01:12:38,723
You should be happy as shit
you landed this job.

1087
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:41,974
There's no telling what they'd
have you do up in the joint.

1088
01:12:43,608 --> 01:12:46,642
By the way...

1089
01:12:47,109 --> 01:12:48,768
what you in for?

1090
01:12:51,903 --> 01:12:53,396
Probably robbed
some old lady, huh?

1091
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:07,157
OK, I know your kind, right?

1092
01:13:07,618 --> 01:13:09,860
Bad-ass peckerwood
with an attitude.

1093
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,361
Let me tell you something, man,
you betterwatch your ass...

1094
01:13:15,831 --> 01:13:19,613
'cause in the joint,
you the nigger, not me.

1095
01:13:23,419 --> 01:13:26,702
I was a year in.
I thought I was cruising.

1096
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,956
Then everything started
getting complicated.

1097
01:13:57,018 --> 01:13:58,560
What the fuck is that?

1098
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:00,718
What's that all about?

1099
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,934
That's just politics, man.
Favours,you know?

1100
01:14:06,648 --> 01:14:09,517
He's doingfavours
forthatfucking spic?

1101
01:14:10,607 --> 01:14:12,564
Mitch has just got
a little something extra...

1102
01:14:13,025 --> 01:14:15,017
on the side
with them boys,you know?

1103
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:17,311
You're kidding, right?

1104
01:14:17,779 --> 01:14:19,521
No.

1105
01:14:19,987 --> 01:14:21,481
That's bullshit, man.

1106
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:23,109
Somebody should say something
to him.

1107
01:14:23,573 --> 01:14:24,735
What the fuck is he thinking?

1108
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,604
Mitch is the only reason
you're not a corpse right now.

1109
01:14:28,075 --> 01:14:30,196
You know what?
I don'tfucking give a shit.

1110
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,402
I can take care of myself.

1111
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:36,402
He shouldn't be doing that.
I'm getting sick of it, man.

1112
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:39,491
There's a lot of hard talk here
and no follow-through.

1113
01:14:42,165 --> 01:14:45,579
I think you better chill out
on the preaching bullshit.

1114
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:48,792
We're getting a little tired
of that shit around here.

1115
01:14:50,211 --> 01:14:52,002
Ease up on it.

1116
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,008
What are you doing here, Doris?

1117
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,219
I was in the neighbourhood.

1118
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,010
Look, I told you I don'twant
you all coming up here.

1119
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:31,231
I don't care
what you told me, OK?

1120
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:32,887
I need to talk to you now.

1121
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:54,528
So, how is everyone?

1122
01:15:54,992 --> 01:15:59,118
Davina's great. She's getting
straight As almost.

1123
01:15:59,577 --> 01:16:04,949
And Ally's walking,
starting to talk a little.

1124
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:11,197
How's Danny?

1125
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,409
He holds you up so high.

1126
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:22,665
He thinks you're the greatest.

1127
01:16:23,131 --> 01:16:25,881
He's always bragging
about you to Cameron...

1128
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,213
and all his new friends.

1129
01:16:31,885 --> 01:16:33,259
He's starting
to remind me of you.

1130
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:36,256
Jesus, don't sound
so worried, all right?

1131
01:16:36,721 --> 01:16:40,337
I'm sure he's fine.
He's 16 years old, Doris.

1132
01:16:40,807 --> 01:16:42,050
He's not gonna be
a little angelforever.

1133
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:44,472
You think because
I watched my firstborn...

1134
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,256
fuck up his entire life
that I can sit here...

1135
01:16:47,727 --> 01:16:50,595
and see my baby follow
him down the same toilet?

1136
01:16:51,062 --> 01:16:52,471
I can'tfix all this shit
from up here.

1137
01:16:52,937 --> 01:16:54,478
I'm not asking you to.

1138
01:16:54,938 --> 01:16:57,724
All it does is make me feel bad.
You're just making it harder.

1139
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:01,438
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1140
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:03,607
You think
you're here all alone?

1141
01:17:04,067 --> 01:17:05,894
You think I'm not in here
with you?

1142
01:17:18,616 --> 01:17:19,896
Fuck, man.

1143
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:24,742
Every day I watch you
go through these sheets...

1144
01:17:25,203 --> 01:17:26,992
like you gonna get
to the end of them.

1145
01:17:28,412 --> 01:17:30,072
Look, nigger,
will you chill the fuck out?

1146
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:31,369
Goddamn!

1147
01:17:31,831 --> 01:17:33,573
No matter how fast
you get through them...

1148
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:36,328
they gonna keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1149
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:38,036
Throwing them around
like that...

1150
01:17:38,502 --> 01:17:40,208
ain't gonna do a damn thing
but give you a heart attack!

1151
01:17:40,668 --> 01:17:41,913
And you know what?
That's cool with me!

1152
01:17:42,378 --> 01:17:44,868
But you gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack,too!

1153
01:17:53,424 --> 01:17:55,002
I know, I'm just a dumb,
stupid nigger, right?

1154
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:57,044
What do I know?

1155
01:17:59,178 --> 01:18:02,296
I know I ain't the one getting
mad at them sheets,though.

1156
01:18:02,763 --> 01:18:05,383
As a matter of fact,
the only sheets I get mad at...

1157
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,721
I'll tell you.

1158
01:18:09,391 --> 01:18:11,430
All right, boy,
this is whatwe gonna do.

1159
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:13,302
We gonna hate some niggers.
That's whatwe'll do today.

1160
01:18:13,768 --> 01:18:15,178
We gonna hate
some goddamn niggers.

1161
01:18:15,645 --> 01:18:16,675
That's all we gonna do is
hate some niggers all day.

1162
01:18:17,144 --> 01:18:19,895
Don't know what a nigger is,
butwe gonna hate them.

1163
01:18:20,354 --> 01:18:21,932
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

1164
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:26,724
workin' next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy.

1165
01:18:44,742 --> 01:18:47,064
See? That's the ticket.

1166
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,487
Nice and easy.

1167
01:18:50,995 --> 01:18:52,820
Now we can ignore
each other in peace.

1168
01:18:56,748 --> 01:18:58,988
"What are you doing?"
You know what he tells me?

1169
01:18:59,373 --> 01:19:02,124
"It's betterthan the pig
I just tried to fuck."

1170
01:19:05,002 --> 01:19:07,039
He never lets me
finish the joke.

1171
01:19:07,503 --> 01:19:08,878
Youfuck him,too?

1172
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,879
Whatever. She's laying on
her back, her legs are open...

1173
01:19:16,132 --> 01:19:20,079
What's up? How you doing?
There you go.

1174
01:19:31,223 --> 01:19:33,592
He was taking it
from the Mexicans...

1175
01:19:34,058 --> 01:19:35,717
and dealing it out
to his own people.

1176
01:19:36,183 --> 01:19:39,182
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

1177
01:20:04,864 --> 01:20:07,615
What? Come on, man.

1178
01:20:08,074 --> 01:20:11,987
Don't look at me like that.
You know what that smells like.

1179
01:20:12,451 --> 01:20:14,822
Don't tell me this smell
don't remind you of a woman.

1180
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,495
God, I miss that smell, man.

1181
01:20:19,746 --> 01:20:22,615
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much betterthan this...

1182
01:20:23,081 --> 01:20:24,824
but at least I got
to go home every night...

1183
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:27,615
and lie down next to
that sweet smell, man.

1184
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:33,242
God, I miss that.
You got a woman?

1185
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,790
Yeah,you got a woman, man.

1186
01:20:36,254 --> 01:20:38,411
Let me give you some advice,
all right?

1187
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:41,252
When she comes to visit you...

1188
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:43,209
whatever you do,
no matterwhat...

1189
01:20:43,675 --> 01:20:45,168
don't let her leave here
in afight, man.

1190
01:20:45,634 --> 01:20:47,258
Don't let herwalk out
with a bad attitude...

1191
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:50,005
'cause if you do,
you spend the nextweek...

1192
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,710
wondering if she's getting her
fuck on with somebody else...

1193
01:20:53,178 --> 01:20:54,293
you know what I'm saying?

1194
01:20:54,763 --> 01:20:56,801
So when she come to see you,
it's nothing but sweet talk.

1195
01:20:57,266 --> 01:20:59,505
Send her away floating,
all right?

1196
01:20:59,973 --> 01:21:02,926
'Cause it's not like the real
world where you can fight...

1197
01:21:03,393 --> 01:21:06,142
'cause you can make up
and have that make-up sex.

1198
01:21:06,602 --> 01:21:07,977
Know what I'm saying?
That angry sex.

1199
01:21:08,436 --> 01:21:09,716
That sex with an attitude.

1200
01:21:10,187 --> 01:21:13,187
You lay on your back and let her
take out that aggression on you.

1201
01:21:13,648 --> 01:21:14,726
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1202
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:17,596
That's that pow, pow, pow.

1203
01:21:18,067 --> 01:21:20,603
Let her get on top,
and she'll punish youfirst.

1204
01:21:21,068 --> 01:21:22,182
"You been a bad boy, huh?

1205
01:21:22,652 --> 01:21:25,224
"You been a bad boy,
and I'm gonna punish you.

1206
01:21:25,695 --> 01:21:26,808
"I'm gonna put it on you.

1207
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:30,195
"Don't you ever...
let...me...catch...you...

1208
01:21:30,656 --> 01:21:33,608
"looking at...another...woman.
Yeah,yeah.

1209
01:21:34,074 --> 01:21:35,153
"I may forgive you
if you bring it.

1210
01:21:35,617 --> 01:21:37,774
"I think I can. l--lforgive.

1211
01:21:38,243 --> 01:21:40,946
"lforgive. Right there.
You're hitting it.

1212
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:42,905
"My spot. That's it. Right.

1213
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:46,737
"Yes. Ifor--lforgive you.
Iforgive you.

1214
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:49,327
"lfor--lfor--
Ifor--lforgive you!

1215
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:51,947
"I love you!"

1216
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,207
How do youfigure the Lakers
to ever be a bigger dynasty...

1217
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,168
than the Celtics?

1218
01:22:13,636 --> 01:22:15,544
The Lakers
are aflare-up, afluke.

1219
01:22:16,012 --> 01:22:16,840
Are you crazy?

1220
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:18,927
One good coach forfour years.
The Celtics are a dynasty!

1221
01:22:19,387 --> 01:22:21,593
Come on, man.
The Celtics, right?

1222
01:22:22,056 --> 01:22:23,847
The ugliest team in
the history of sports.

1223
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:26,049
A dynasty of
ugly motherfuckers, man.

1224
01:22:26,516 --> 01:22:28,307
Look at Kevin McHale.

1225
01:22:28,768 --> 01:22:31,055
James Worthy. That guy
has a head like a melon.

1226
01:22:31,518 --> 01:22:32,348
He had ladies.

1227
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:35,218
I can't even talk to you.
I don't know what you're saying.

1228
01:22:35,688 --> 01:22:38,094
You are tweaking.
Boston Celtics.

1229
01:22:38,564 --> 01:22:40,188
-How many is that?
-That's enough.

1230
01:22:40,649 --> 01:22:41,847
Enough? All right.

1231
01:22:45,608 --> 01:22:46,937
You got that?

1232
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:54,107
-I lost count, man.
-Doesn't matter, man.

1233
01:22:54,572 --> 01:22:57,193
Who's counting anyway?

1234
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,567
All right,
so I wanna know something.

1235
01:23:07,619 --> 01:23:09,197
What the fuck
landed you in here?

1236
01:23:09,662 --> 01:23:11,453
You didn't kill anybody,
too skinny for a gangbanger.

1237
01:23:11,913 --> 01:23:14,119
Ain't that a bitch?
Don't judge a book by its cover.

1238
01:23:14,581 --> 01:23:15,696
I can throw these things.

1239
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:18,572
Whatever. Come on.
What did you do?

1240
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:21,116
None of your business.
It's embarrassing.

1241
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:23,541
It's none of
your goddamn business.

1242
01:23:24,629 --> 01:23:27,118
Come on. Everybody in here
is embarrassed.

1243
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:30,079
Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1244
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,547
What'd you do?

1245
01:23:34,549 --> 01:23:36,707
Look, man, I stole a TV,
all right?

1246
01:23:37,176 --> 01:23:39,333
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing about that?

1247
01:23:39,802 --> 01:23:43,133
I stole a TVfrom a store
next to a doughnut shop.

1248
01:23:43,597 --> 01:23:46,085
I ran out,the owner's
right behind me yelling.

1249
01:23:46,555 --> 01:23:48,214
Bam! I run into three cops.

1250
01:23:48,681 --> 01:23:51,598
I told you itwas embarrassing.
You're laughing.

1251
01:23:52,058 --> 01:23:54,096
Wait a sec,wait a sec.

1252
01:23:54,559 --> 01:23:56,468
That don't make sense.

1253
01:23:57,728 --> 01:24:01,094
Nah,you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV. Come on.

1254
01:24:01,562 --> 01:24:04,728
I come out,the police officer
grabs my arm...

1255
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:06,647
the TVfalls on his foot
and breaks it.

1256
01:24:07,107 --> 01:24:11,434
They said I threw the TV at him.
Assault. Six years.

1257
01:24:11,901 --> 01:24:15,600
Come on. Tell the truth.
You chucked it at him.

1258
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:18,606
Like I said,
I came out of the store...

1259
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:22,569
he grabbed my arm,
itfell on his foot.

1260
01:24:27,575 --> 01:24:28,357
Come on now.

1261
01:24:28,827 --> 01:24:31,612
What you gotfor me, huh?

1262
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:33,491
There you go, baby!

1263
01:24:33,953 --> 01:24:36,324
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.

1264
01:25:14,847 --> 01:25:15,714
Fuck you!

1265
01:25:16,182 --> 01:25:18,008
Give me a towel. Hold him.

1266
01:25:25,311 --> 01:25:26,722
You wanna be a nigger,
sweet boy?

1267
01:25:27,187 --> 01:25:29,226
-Fuck you!
-We gonna treat you like one.

1268
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:32,806
-No.
-Come on.

1269
01:25:34,901 --> 01:25:36,476
Come on, give it to him!

1270
01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:49,316
Fuck you!

1271
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:55,282
Thatwas real sweet.

1272
01:25:55,744 --> 01:25:56,942
Fuck you!

1273
01:26:29,427 --> 01:26:30,885
How is he?

1274
01:26:31,678 --> 01:26:34,048
Well, he took six stitches.

1275
01:27:15,449 --> 01:27:17,985
Man,what the hell are you
doing here, anyway?

1276
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:21,153
I came to talk about Danny, but
we don't have to do that now.

1277
01:27:21,619 --> 01:27:23,575
I brought you some books.

1278
01:27:26,037 --> 01:27:28,953
What about him,you know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1279
01:27:29,413 --> 01:27:31,405
He's headed rightwhere you are.

1280
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:35,533
You know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me.

1281
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,241
Danny's not my responsibility.

1282
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:39,954
What do you expect me
to do with that?

1283
01:27:40,419 --> 01:27:42,992
It doesn't help me.
Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1284
01:27:43,464 --> 01:27:44,706
I don'twant you to do anything.

1285
01:27:45,421 --> 01:27:46,963
I need to know the truth
about how youfeel.

1286
01:27:47,422 --> 01:27:48,999
You think I want him in here?

1287
01:27:49,466 --> 01:27:51,587
I mean...I don't know.

1288
01:27:52,049 --> 01:27:53,508
I don't know what lfeel.
I'm all...

1289
01:27:55,636 --> 01:27:57,343
lfeel a little inside out.

1290
01:27:57,803 --> 01:27:59,344
I'm,you know--I don't know.

1291
01:27:59,804 --> 01:28:03,337
There's some things
that...that don'tfit.

1292
01:28:03,806 --> 01:28:06,046
Well,that happens.

1293
01:28:07,099 --> 01:28:09,256
You are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

1294
01:28:09,726 --> 01:28:11,800
pretending you don't see
all the holes in this bullshit.

1295
01:28:12,267 --> 01:28:13,726
Hey, listen.
I said I was confused.

1296
01:28:14,185 --> 01:28:16,011
I didn't say
I didn't believe in it.

1297
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:17,972
All right. That's why
you have to stay open.

1298
01:28:18,437 --> 01:28:20,560
Right now,your anger
is consuming you here.

1299
01:28:21,022 --> 01:28:23,809
Your anger is shutting down
the brain God gave you.

1300
01:28:24,274 --> 01:28:25,850
God. You know, man?
You've been talking about...

1301
01:28:26,316 --> 01:28:27,691
what's going on with me
since I was in high school.

1302
01:28:28,151 --> 01:28:30,523
How the fuck do you know
what's going on inside me?

1303
01:28:30,986 --> 01:28:34,567
No, I know about me.
I know about this place.

1304
01:28:35,029 --> 01:28:36,524
I know about the place
you are in.

1305
01:28:36,989 --> 01:28:39,312
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

1306
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:41,525
There was a moment...

1307
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:44,528
when I used to blame
everything and everyone...

1308
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:46,949
for all
the pain and suffering...

1309
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:49,153
and vile things
that happened to me...

1310
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,777
that I saw happen to my people.

1311
01:28:52,246 --> 01:28:53,656
Used to blame everybody.

1312
01:28:54,122 --> 01:28:57,075
Blamed white people,
blamed society, blamed God.

1313
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,374
I didn't get no answers 'cause
I asked the wrong questions.

1314
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:02,957
You have to ask
the right question.

1315
01:29:03,419 --> 01:29:04,616
Like what?

1316
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:10,004
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1317
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:31,930
You gotta help me, man.

1318
01:29:34,684 --> 01:29:36,343
Just help me.

1319
01:29:38,352 --> 01:29:40,426
Get me out of here,you know?

1320
01:29:43,105 --> 01:29:45,772
I'm up in four months
for review.

1321
01:29:47,398 --> 01:29:48,891
Put in a wordfor me.

1322
01:29:49,357 --> 01:29:51,645
I already have. So you're
out there, and then what?

1323
01:29:52,108 --> 01:29:54,480
I don'twant to fuck up
my family anymore.

1324
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,816
I'll go as far away
as I can get.

1325
01:29:57,278 --> 01:29:58,606
That's not good enough.

1326
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:01,939
You want my help,
you gotta do betterthan that.

1327
01:30:02,405 --> 01:30:04,611
My help is not unconditional.

1328
01:30:05,073 --> 01:30:08,275
Running just ain't good enough.

1329
01:30:40,965 --> 01:30:43,835
Fuck him. Fuck him.

1330
01:30:44,301 --> 01:30:45,923
Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1331
01:30:47,344 --> 01:30:48,292
What's up, D?

1332
01:30:48,762 --> 01:30:51,925
What's all that bullshit
you pulled in the mess hall?

1333
01:30:53,263 --> 01:30:55,669
You out of yourfuckin' mind?
Are youfuckin' crazy?

1334
01:30:56,141 --> 01:30:57,883
D, look at me, man!

1335
01:30:58,349 --> 01:31:00,636
You can't make it in here
on your own.

1336
01:31:01,101 --> 01:31:02,891
I'm not afraid of
those fuckin' pussies.

1337
01:31:03,352 --> 01:31:04,845
There was six of them,
and they jumped me.

1338
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:07,349
Thatwon't happen again.
I hope they fuckin' try.

1339
01:31:07,812 --> 01:31:09,851
Man, I'm not talking
about your peckerwoodfriends!

1340
01:31:10,313 --> 01:31:12,269
They're protecting
your stupid ass!

1341
01:31:12,731 --> 01:31:16,099
You dissed them in public!
Now you're on yourfuckin' own!

1342
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:18,853
Yo, man, I'm talking about
the brothers, all right?

1343
01:31:19,318 --> 01:31:22,021
They'llfuck you,then
smoke your motherfucking ass!

1344
01:31:22,485 --> 01:31:24,857
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

1345
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,862
You think I haven't
thought about that?

1346
01:31:27,322 --> 01:31:30,855
If they come for me,they come.
There ain't nothing I can do.

1347
01:31:32,199 --> 01:31:34,025
What can I do, man?

1348
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,818
So I was right back
where I started.

1349
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:43,325
Every day
I was sure itwas my day.

1350
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:47,152
Every time
I stepped out of my cell...

1351
01:31:47,623 --> 01:31:50,195
every time
I got in that shower...

1352
01:31:53,376 --> 01:31:54,835
lfigured itwas
only a matter of time...

1353
01:31:55,294 --> 01:31:57,250
before they made a move.

1354
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:00,577
I just hoped it'd be quick.

1355
01:32:32,269 --> 01:32:34,558
But it never came.

1356
01:32:36,356 --> 01:32:37,185
I couldn'tfigure it out.

1357
01:32:37,648 --> 01:32:39,225
I knew some of them
were itchingfor it.

1358
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:41,268
After awhile,
I just put my head down...

1359
01:32:41,733 --> 01:32:43,108
and read the stuff
that Sweeney sent me...

1360
01:32:43,568 --> 01:32:45,190
and I kept to myself.

1361
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:51,060
Last six months in that place,
I was like a ghost.

1362
01:33:04,869 --> 01:33:07,193
What's up, man?
You getting out?

1363
01:33:09,414 --> 01:33:10,787
Come on, man.
What the fuck you waiting on?

1364
01:33:11,247 --> 01:33:13,369
Get the fuck on outta here, man.

1365
01:33:15,207 --> 01:33:16,867
Yeah,you know,
I got this funny feeling.

1366
01:33:17,334 --> 01:33:19,289
Oh,yeah? What's that?

1367
01:33:20,668 --> 01:33:21,866
I'm thinking maybe
the only reason...

1368
01:33:22,336 --> 01:33:24,374
I'm getting out of here
in one piece is you.

1369
01:33:25,796 --> 01:33:26,791
Come on, man!
Get the fuck outta here!

1370
01:33:27,254 --> 01:33:28,748
You think I'm gonna
put my neck on the line...

1371
01:33:29,215 --> 01:33:30,874
for some crazy ass peckerwood?

1372
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:32,798
Yeah. Right.

1373
01:33:33,258 --> 01:33:35,415
Stupid.

1374
01:33:41,221 --> 01:33:42,762
That's what I thought.

1375
01:33:47,223 --> 01:33:48,882
I owe you, man.

1376
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:51,506
Man,you don't owe me shit,
all right?

1377
01:33:54,519 --> 01:33:55,717
Yes, I do.

1378
01:34:05,774 --> 01:34:07,351
You'll be outta here in no time.

1379
01:34:07,817 --> 01:34:10,271
Man,
it's a piece of cake, all right?

1380
01:34:12,361 --> 01:34:13,734
Just take it easy
on the brothers, all right?

1381
01:34:14,195 --> 01:34:15,439
The brothers!

1382
01:34:25,784 --> 01:34:27,111
God, man.

1383
01:34:29,744 --> 01:34:31,486
Sorry, Derek.

1384
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:34,736
Sorry that happened to you.

1385
01:34:35,997 --> 01:34:38,700
Well, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1386
01:34:39,165 --> 01:34:42,164
lfeel lucky,
'cause it's wrong, Dan.

1387
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:45,751
It's wrong,
and itwas eating me up.

1388
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,752
Itwas gonna kill me.

1389
01:34:48,211 --> 01:34:49,789
And I kept asking myself
all the time...

1390
01:34:50,254 --> 01:34:54,166
how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1391
01:34:55,965 --> 01:34:57,790
It's just 'cause
I was pissed off.

1392
01:34:59,008 --> 01:35:02,090
Nothing I ever did
evertook thatfeeling away.

1393
01:35:03,844 --> 01:35:06,677
I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1394
01:35:08,596 --> 01:35:10,753
And it didn't make me
feel any different.

1395
01:35:12,014 --> 01:35:12,844
Just got me more lost...

1396
01:35:13,306 --> 01:35:15,382
and I'm tired of feeling
pissed-off, Danny.

1397
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:18,339
I'm just tired of it.

1398
01:35:18,809 --> 01:35:21,097
And I'm not telling you
what to do.

1399
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,013
I'm really not.

1400
01:35:24,937 --> 01:35:27,095
But I need you to understand...

1401
01:35:28,981 --> 01:35:32,098
'cause I love you,
and you're my bestfriend.

1402
01:35:34,318 --> 01:35:35,775
Do you understand?

1403
01:35:36,236 --> 01:35:38,108
Yeah, I understand.

1404
01:35:41,738 --> 01:35:43,112
All right.

1405
01:35:47,115 --> 01:35:48,490
Jesus.

1406
01:36:05,248 --> 01:36:06,707
Hi. Everything OK?

1407
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:08,161
Ah, everything's great.

1408
01:36:08,626 --> 01:36:10,949
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1409
01:36:11,418 --> 01:36:12,912
-No. Thank you.
-You sure?

1410
01:36:13,378 --> 01:36:16,331
Yeah. This is good.
Thank you.

1411
01:36:16,796 --> 01:36:19,084
All right. Come on, let's go.

1412
01:36:40,349 --> 01:36:41,547
Good night.

1413
01:37:48,299 --> 01:37:50,006
I'm gonna take a shower,
all right?

1414
01:38:24,358 --> 01:38:25,271
It's hard to look back...

1415
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,188
and see the truth
about people you love.

1416
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,142
I think if you asked Derek why
it all went the way it did...

1417
01:38:31,611 --> 01:38:32,774
and where it all started...

1418
01:38:33,237 --> 01:38:35,989
he'd still say it started
when ourfatherwas murdered.

1419
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,148
The truth is,
it started earlier.

1420
01:38:39,616 --> 01:38:42,402
Are we all meeting
forthe game tonight?

1421
01:38:42,867 --> 01:38:43,649
Definitely.

1422
01:38:44,117 --> 01:38:45,362
All right,
Ben's Burger at 7:00...

1423
01:38:45,827 --> 01:38:47,025
then we go watch
the big guy play.

1424
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:51,162
Psyching upforthe game?

1425
01:38:51,621 --> 01:38:54,372
I'm always ready forthat.
I got an English exam.

1426
01:38:54,831 --> 01:38:56,539
I'm having a heart attack.
I'm not ready.

1427
01:38:56,999 --> 01:38:58,623
What's the matter?
Afraid you'll get a "B"?

1428
01:38:59,084 --> 01:39:01,573
Might do you good. B-minus.

1429
01:39:02,044 --> 01:39:04,580
Hey, don't laugh.
This guy is different.

1430
01:39:05,044 --> 01:39:07,167
Dr. Sweeney.
This guy's unbelievable.

1431
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:09,206
Unbelievable. I've never
had a teacher like this.

1432
01:39:09,673 --> 01:39:10,703
He's got two Ph.D.s.

1433
01:39:11,172 --> 01:39:14,089
I don't know what he's doing
teaching at our school.

1434
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:15,415
What's he got you reading?

1435
01:39:15,884 --> 01:39:19,048
We got this essay exam
on "Native Son."

1436
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:21,632
"Native Son"?
I don't know that.

1437
01:39:22,095 --> 01:39:23,505
That's a big surprise.

1438
01:39:24,637 --> 01:39:26,096
What? I read.

1439
01:39:27,181 --> 01:39:30,548
Honey,they don't teach
Tom Clancy in school.

1440
01:39:32,225 --> 01:39:33,553
Well,they don't.

1441
01:39:34,018 --> 01:39:35,559
So what is this "Native Son"?

1442
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:38,601
It's this book
about this black guy.

1443
01:39:39,062 --> 01:39:41,597
We're doing this whole
black literature unit.

1444
01:39:42,064 --> 01:39:44,184
Is it Black History Month?

1445
01:39:44,646 --> 01:39:46,555
No, it's just
this guy Sweeney,you know?

1446
01:39:47,024 --> 01:39:48,932
It's part of the course now.

1447
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:56,684
What?

1448
01:39:57,153 --> 01:39:59,524
Nothing. It's just...

1449
01:39:59,987 --> 01:40:01,697
It's everywhere I look now.

1450
01:40:02,157 --> 01:40:03,946
What?

1451
01:40:05,574 --> 01:40:07,898
This affirmative blacktion.

1452
01:40:08,368 --> 01:40:13,240
Afew new books doesn't qualify
as affirmative black action.

1453
01:40:14,412 --> 01:40:15,823
Read the book,
ace the guy's test.

1454
01:40:16,288 --> 01:40:18,326
Just don't swallow
everything he feeds you whole.

1455
01:40:18,789 --> 01:40:19,784
Just 'cause you see it
on the evening news...

1456
01:40:20,248 --> 01:40:21,078
I know, butwhat?

1457
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:23,082
All this stuff about
making everything equal.

1458
01:40:23,541 --> 01:40:24,536
It's not that simple.

1459
01:40:25,001 --> 01:40:26,493
Now you got this book
"Native Son."

1460
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,537
What happened to
the other books in the course?

1461
01:40:29,003 --> 01:40:33,080
They're not any good anymore
because Mr. Two Ph.D. says so?

1462
01:40:33,547 --> 01:40:35,538
Now you gotta trade in
great books for black books?

1463
01:40:36,007 --> 01:40:38,294
Does that make sense?

1464
01:40:38,757 --> 01:40:40,500
You gotta question
these things, Derek.

1465
01:40:40,966 --> 01:40:42,544
You gotta look
at the whole picture.

1466
01:40:43,009 --> 01:40:45,629
We're talking about books here.
I'm also talking about my job.

1467
01:40:46,094 --> 01:40:48,501
I got two black guys
on my squad now...

1468
01:40:48,971 --> 01:40:51,127
who got their job
over a couple of white guys...

1469
01:40:51,597 --> 01:40:53,220
who actually scored higher
on the test.

1470
01:40:53,682 --> 01:40:56,467
Does that make sense?

1471
01:40:56,932 --> 01:41:00,217
Everything's equal now, but I
got two guys watching my back...

1472
01:41:00,685 --> 01:41:04,265
responsible for my life
who aren't as good.

1473
01:41:04,728 --> 01:41:06,102
They only got the job
because they were black...

1474
01:41:06,562 --> 01:41:08,519
not because they were the best.

1475
01:41:08,981 --> 01:41:11,600
-That sucks.
-Is thatwhat America's about?

1476
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:13,475
No,America's about
best man forthe job.

1477
01:41:13,942 --> 01:41:15,684
You do your best,
you get the job.

1478
01:41:16,151 --> 01:41:18,723
This affirmative-action crap...

1479
01:41:19,193 --> 01:41:20,474
I don't know what that's about.

1480
01:41:20,944 --> 01:41:24,690
There's like some hidden agenda
or something going on.

1481
01:41:25,155 --> 01:41:26,268
You see what I'm saying?

1482
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:29,229
Yeah, I do. I didn't
think about it like that.

1483
01:41:30,907 --> 01:41:32,449
This guy,though--I don't know.

1484
01:41:32,908 --> 01:41:34,616
Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on so strong...

1485
01:41:35,077 --> 01:41:36,487
it's hard
not to listen to him...

1486
01:41:36,952 --> 01:41:39,157
but maybe some of
what he says is kinda...

1487
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:40,818
It's bullshit.

1488
01:41:41,956 --> 01:41:43,697
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1489
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:47,911
No. It's nigger bullshit.

1490
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:52,621
-You see that, don't you?
-Yeah.

1491
01:41:53,085 --> 01:41:54,495
You gotta watch outforthat.

1492
01:41:54,961 --> 01:41:57,995
Yeah. No, I getwhat
you're saying. I will.

1493
01:41:59,504 --> 01:42:01,128
Good boy.

1494
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:03,296
I'm proud of you.

1495
01:42:03,757 --> 01:42:05,299
Don'tworry about it. I got it.

1496
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:12,354
And in about one minute...

1497
01:44:12,819 --> 01:44:15,061
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1498
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:17,770
I don't know
if I've ever done that.

1499
01:44:19,031 --> 01:44:21,782
Anyway,we're gonna try to pick
things up and start over.

1500
01:44:22,242 --> 01:44:25,360
Itwon't be easy,
butwe're all together again...

1501
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:27,864
and lfeel good.

1502
01:44:28,828 --> 01:44:31,365
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted--

1503
01:44:31,829 --> 01:44:33,370
if I hit
the social significance...

1504
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:35,657
orwhatever
you're lookingfor...

1505
01:44:36,123 --> 01:44:39,704
butforwhat it's worth,
thanks a lot.

1506
01:44:54,132 --> 01:44:58,377
Wow. You look great.
Look at you.

1507
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:02,630
Yeah. Gotta dress up
forthe parole officer.

1508
01:45:03,094 --> 01:45:04,006
Is she cute?

1509
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:06,213
She is afat guy named Hector...

1510
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,928
-Oh. Well...
-So I'm out of luck.

1511
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:13,303
I just gotta check in...

1512
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,509
then I'm gonna see about
getting my old job back.

1513
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:18,761
-Great.
-Good morning.

1514
01:45:20,061 --> 01:45:20,974
Davina, can you help?

1515
01:45:21,437 --> 01:45:22,765
Your sister's gonna help you.

1516
01:45:23,812 --> 01:45:25,188
You look great. Knock 'em dead.

1517
01:45:25,647 --> 01:45:26,761
Thanks.

1518
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:29,685
Come on, sweetie. Whatwould

1519
01:45:32,275 --> 01:45:35,110

01:45:35,569 --> 01:45:37,725
-You look good.
-Yeah?

01:45:39,779 --> 01:45:41,356

01:45:44,197 --> 01:45:46,948
Yeah. lfeel,you know...

1523
01:45:47,407 --> 01:45:48,901
a little...

1524
01:45:49,367 --> 01:45:51,821
I'm getting there.

1525
01:45:53,369 --> 01:45:55,242
Listen...I don't know--

1526
01:45:56,829 --> 01:45:59,116
I don't know
if it's OK that I'm here.

1527
01:46:03,415 --> 01:46:04,613
I want to be here.

1528
01:46:23,342 --> 01:46:25,001
-I'm gonna get a paper.
-Cool.

1529
01:46:42,518 --> 01:46:45,268
-What do you want?
-Maple bar and a large milk.

1530
01:46:45,727 --> 01:46:47,103
All right. I got it.

1531
01:46:51,689 --> 01:46:53,313
Let me get a coffee...

1532
01:46:53,773 --> 01:46:55,849
a maple bar,
and a large milk to go.

1533
01:46:56,316 --> 01:46:57,560
Right away.

1534
01:47:07,529 --> 01:47:09,901
Derek,we need to talk.

1535
01:47:10,364 --> 01:47:11,277
What's going on?

1536
01:47:11,741 --> 01:47:15,902
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1537
01:47:16,367 --> 01:47:17,281
They were jumped last night
near Ben's Burgers.

1538
01:47:17,744 --> 01:47:19,200
How bad?

1539
01:47:19,662 --> 01:47:20,906
Well, it looks
like they're gonna live.

1540
01:47:21,371 --> 01:47:24,453
-Then they got lucky.
-Somebody's gotta lose,though.

1541
01:47:26,998 --> 01:47:28,196
What?

1542
01:47:29,582 --> 01:47:32,285
We were kinda hoping maybe
you'd talk to your old crew--

1543
01:47:32,751 --> 01:47:33,864
Come on. No way.

1544
01:47:34,336 --> 01:47:37,037
If there's anybody they're
gonna listen to, it's you.

1545
01:47:37,502 --> 01:47:39,376
No. I hate to tell you,
but I'm out, OK?

1546
01:47:39,838 --> 01:47:41,379
Those guys are probably
gunningfor me now.

1547
01:47:41,838 --> 01:47:43,248
We're asking
for your help here, Derek.

1548
01:47:43,714 --> 01:47:45,705
Did you tell him
I was gonna do this?

1549
01:47:52,553 --> 01:47:54,295
This has got nothing
to do with me anymore.

1550
01:47:54,762 --> 01:47:57,215
Yes, it does. It has
everything to do with you.

1551
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,051
God,what are you doing to me?
I'm doing my best!

1552
01:48:00,514 --> 01:48:02,838
I'm going like this just to keep
my family in the clear.

1553
01:48:03,307 --> 01:48:04,387
Don't ask me to fix
this fuckin' situation!

1554
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:06,391
-I'm not asking that.
-Itwas there before me.

1555
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:09,222
You helped create it.
You wanna take a break now?

1556
01:48:09,685 --> 01:48:11,143
You take a break,
you'llfind no peace.

1557
01:48:11,603 --> 01:48:14,271
The way to find peace
is to stick.

1558
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:16,223
It's not gonna make
afuckin' bit of difference.

1559
01:48:16,688 --> 01:48:19,475
-It might.
-Not a bit.

1560
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:23,272
I mean, do you know
what you're asking me to do?

1561
01:48:23,733 --> 01:48:26,567
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever's in your powerto do.

1562
01:48:28,112 --> 01:48:30,351
Oh, man.

1563
01:48:33,114 --> 01:48:34,441
Fuck.

1564
01:48:39,033 --> 01:48:40,443
All right.

1565
01:48:42,285 --> 01:48:44,821
You know what you're gonna do?
Get me shot by white boys.

1566
01:48:45,286 --> 01:48:46,827
I doubt it.

1567
01:48:47,286 --> 01:48:50,321
We're all gonna have a laugh
at that, let me tell ya.

1568
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:54,451
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1569
01:48:54,916 --> 01:48:55,994
Come on.

1570
01:48:56,457 --> 01:48:59,790
Hey,you. You got something
goodfor me this morning?

1571
01:49:00,251 --> 01:49:01,201
I'll give it to you,
Dr. Sweeney.

1572
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:02,866
-Yeah, OK.
-All right.

1573
01:49:07,756 --> 01:49:09,711
What's goin' on?

1574
01:49:14,676 --> 01:49:15,838
Come on, let's go.

1575
01:49:31,642 --> 01:49:34,180
It's just so badfor Seth, man.

1576
01:49:34,644 --> 01:49:37,393
I wonder how bad
they gotfucked up.

1577
01:49:38,812 --> 01:49:41,018
I'm glad they're not dead.
Otherthan that, I don't care.

1578
01:49:42,689 --> 01:49:43,601
Should we visit them?

1579
01:49:44,065 --> 01:49:46,187
No. Definitely not.

1580
01:49:46,649 --> 01:49:48,227
Just stay out of it.

1581
01:49:48,692 --> 01:49:52,189
Listen. I saw a car cruising
by the house last night...

1582
01:49:52,653 --> 01:49:54,194
when I pulled
out of there with Seth.

1583
01:49:54,653 --> 01:49:57,189
If you get home before me today,
give a look around the street.

1584
01:49:57,654 --> 01:50:00,191
Make sure
there's nothing going on.

1585
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,278
Man,this is bad.

1586
01:50:05,659 --> 01:50:08,113
-They're after you, man.
-It'll cool off.

1587
01:50:08,576 --> 01:50:12,026
If I made it through Chino,
this should be a piece of cake.

1588
01:50:14,372 --> 01:50:15,569
You gonna be OK?

1589
01:50:20,541 --> 01:50:21,323
What are you gonna do?

1590
01:50:21,792 --> 01:50:24,744
I'll work it out.
Keep your head up, all right?

1591
01:50:25,209 --> 01:50:28,245
Things are gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

1592
01:50:28,712 --> 01:50:30,454
Go turn that paper in.

1593
01:50:32,213 --> 01:50:34,999
All right. See ya.

1594
01:50:35,465 --> 01:50:36,662
Come here.

1595
01:50:42,677 --> 01:50:43,874
I'll see you at home.

1596
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,302
All right?

1597
01:50:48,638 --> 01:50:50,713
Yeah, I'll see you.
Good luck, all right?

1598
01:50:51,181 --> 01:50:54,134
-Yeah.
-See you later.

1599
01:50:59,894 --> 01:51:02,465
-Gonna be late.
-We better go.

1600
01:51:03,478 --> 01:51:04,723
All right. Come on.

1601
01:51:27,782 --> 01:51:28,564
Bye.

1602
01:51:29,032 --> 01:51:31,948
I'll catch up with you.
See you later.

1603
01:52:53,657 --> 01:52:55,281
Get out of my way!

1604
01:52:55,741 --> 01:52:57,400
All right! Let him go!

1605
01:52:59,827 --> 01:53:01,025
Oh, no.

1606
01:53:04,204 --> 01:53:06,242
Aw,Jesus.

1607
01:53:29,758 --> 01:53:31,003
Oh,Jesus.

1608
01:53:31,467 --> 01:53:33,459
God,what did I do?

1609
01:54:02,149 --> 01:54:05,516
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1610
01:54:05,609 --> 01:54:07,601
My conclusion, right?

1611
01:54:08,568 --> 01:54:12,316
Well, my conclusion is
hate is baggage.

1612
01:54:13,155 --> 01:54:16,485
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1613
01:54:16,947 --> 01:54:18,821
It's just notworth it.

1614
01:54:21,534 --> 01:54:25,197
Derek says it's always good
to end a paperwith a quote.

1615
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:27,533
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1616
01:54:27,995 --> 01:54:29,488
so if you can't top it...

1617
01:54:29,953 --> 01:54:32,030
stealfrom them
and go out strong.

1618
01:54:32,497 --> 01:54:34,821
So I picked a guy
I thought you'd like.

1619
01:54:36,165 --> 01:54:39,912
"We are not enemies,
butfriends.

1620
01:54:40,376 --> 01:54:42,248
"We must not be enemies.

1621
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:44,618
"Though passion
may have strained...

1622
01:54:45,086 --> 01:54:47,328
"we must not break
our bonds of affection.

1623
01:54:47,796 --> 01:54:50,083
"The mystic chords of memory...

1624
01:54:50,547 --> 01:54:52,669
"will swell
when again touched...

1625
01:54:53,132 --> 01:54:54,674
"as surely they will be...

1626
01:54:55,133 --> 01:54:58,001
"by the better angels
of our nature."
