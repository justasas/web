I won't stay in my room the rest of my life.

Hold on.

Hey. Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

344
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:05,922
Did you invite him over?

345
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:08,635
No, he always comes over here.

When was the last time
you were able to see your feet?

Come in here, Danny.

Hey, man,
you going to Cam's party tonight?

355
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:57,669
Is Davina's ass watertight?

You're fucking sick, man.

All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

I'm not in the mood.
I got homework to do.

359

Tell me some of the shit you've learned,
fuck-ass, before I pistol-whip you.

360
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:15,299
Okay. I believe in death, destruction,
chaos, filth and greed.

361
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:20,733
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I wanna hear, asshole.

You mean that shit about your mother?
- You wanna get fucking beaten, Danny?

I'm not fucking talking to you, Davina.
Why don't you shut up?

364
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:34,806
Look, you got to let me do this
my own way, all right?

365
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:36,374
I'll take care of it.

SETH: Who do you hate, Danny?

367
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:41,463
I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.

368
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:42,839
SETH: Why?

369
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,508
They're a burden to the advancement
of the white race.

370
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:50,013
Some of them are all right, I guess.
- None of them are fucking all right, Danny.

371
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:52,849
They're all fucking freeloaders.
Remember what Cam said?

372
00:27:52,949 --> 00:27:58,480
'We don't know them. We don't wanna
know them. They're the fucking enemy.'

What don't you like about them?
And say it with some fucking conviction.

I hate the fact that it's cool
to be black these days.

DANNY: I hate this hip-hop...

on white fucking suburbia.

That's the best shit I've heard
come out of your mouth.

00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:28,593
Danny, no. I feel sorry for you, Danny.

I know you don't believe that.

00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,680
Shut up, Davina.
- No, you shut the fuck up.

00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,433
Get out of the house, you piece of shit.
Please go.

00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,393
Is that any way to talk to a guest?

A friend of the family?

389

my arms almost all the way around you.

Grab your jacket,

No, just the usual.
- I'm telling you, man, this kid is awesome.

401

Did you turn in a paper on Mein Kampf?
- Yeah.

SETH: Sweeney probably shit his pants.
- He did, man.

Did Cameron put you up to that?
Did he tell you to do that?

No, man, I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know, though?

How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter how.

- Sweeney's a good teacher, all right?

talk to my brother. I'm glad to see you.

I'm serious. It's not funny.

You can learn from him.

with small-fry shit like that.

he's making me write.

I know about it. He told me about it.
I don't care.

Do it. You do anything he tells
you to do. I mean it.

Holy fuck. He's here?

833
00:57:49,584 --> 00:57:51,361
Yeah, he's here.
- He's fucking here.

834
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:54,691
Go pay your respects.
- Fuck you, Seth.

835
00:57:55,966 --> 00:57:58,686
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

836
00:57:59,135 --> 00:58:02,163
Father Vinyard?
- How's it going? I'm Jason, this is Chris.

837
00:58:02,263 --> 00:58:05,333
We're friends with your brother.
- You are a fucking god, man.

838
00:58:05,433 --> 00:58:07,898
Oh, shit, yeah.
STACEY: Derek.

839
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:14,399
DEREK: Hey.

840
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:27,063
I thought you turned that paper in.
- I did...

841
00:58:27,163 --> 00:58:29,149
...and now fucking Murray turned me in...

842
00:58:29,249 --> 00:58:33,244
...and so Sweeney's
making me write another one.

843
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,074
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying, now, does he?

844
00:58:38,174 --> 00:58:41,202
He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger
people. I hate those guys.

845
00:58:41,302 --> 00:58:43,079
Now, wait a minute, Danny.

846
00:58:43,179 --> 00:58:45,179
He's not proud.

847
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:50,728
He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

848
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:55,133
He's trying to make you feel guilty
about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah.

849
00:58:55,233 --> 00:58:58,970
Some nigger, some spic writes about
Martin Luther King...

850
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,139
...or fucking Cesar 'Commie' Chavez...

851
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,391
Heh-heh-heh.
...gets a pat on the head.

852
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:05,491
Yeah.

853
00:59:05,618 --> 00:59:09,689
I mean, you can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

854
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:11,789
Definitely.

855
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:16,488
STACEY [WHISPERS]:
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

856
00:59:16,588 --> 00:59:18,588
No, listen to me.

857
00:59:19,632 --> 00:59:25,667
I wanna see you, okay? I do.
But I gotta take care of something tonight.

858
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:28,807
Okay.
- You understand?

859
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:32,630
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

860
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,886
Look, would you do something with me?
- Anything.

861
00:59:39,986 --> 00:59:41,986
Leave with me.

862
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:45,517
Leave where?
- Leave here. Leave all this.

863
00:59:45,617 --> 00:59:47,185
Just come with me.

864
00:59:47,285 --> 00:59:50,897
Why would you wanna leave? They
worship you. You're like a god to them.

865
00:59:50,997 --> 00:59:52,816
If you think we had it good before...

866
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:55,777
...wait till you see what it's like now.
- I don't want all that.

867
00:59:55,877 --> 00:59:59,572
I don't want my family involved.
Everything I've done here has fucked it up.

868
00:59:59,672 --> 01:00:03,827
Do you understand?
- You think what you did was wrong?

869
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:05,927
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

870
01:00:06,012 --> 01:00:08,206
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

871
01:00:08,306 --> 01:00:10,346
...and we all know that.

872
01:00:10,433 --> 01:00:12,002
I understand you just got out...

873
01:00:12,102 --> 01:00:14,754
...but no one's gonna hurt you.
No one can touch you.

874
01:00:14,854 --> 01:00:16,381
There's a small army out there.

875
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:18,883
We won't let a bunch of spooks
kick us out of here.

876
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:22,178
Stacey, you're not listening to me, okay?
I'm not scared.

877
01:00:22,278 --> 01:00:24,318
I don't want it anymore.

878
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:27,764
I'm done with it. I'm through with this.

879
01:00:27,826 --> 01:00:28,935
It's...

880
01:00:29,035 --> 01:00:31,286
It's bullshit, Stacey.

881
01:00:32,122 --> 01:00:34,983
Listen, you don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

882
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:38,945
If you wanna be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

883
01:00:39,045 --> 01:00:40,447
Come on.

884
01:00:40,547 --> 01:00:41,656
You're nuts.

885
01:00:41,756 --> 01:00:43,756
You are nuts. No way.

886
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,911
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

887
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:50,749
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

888
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:53,126
I mean, it is like nothing
you have ever seen.

889
01:00:53,226 --> 01:00:54,627
This is a mistake. Forget it.

890
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:57,630
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

891
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,883
Stacey, just say goodbye.
Just say goodbye.

892
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:02,025
This isn't you.

893
01:01:02,193 --> 01:01:03,193
I know you.

894
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:06,783
You don't know anything about me, Stacey.

895
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:14,606
Hey. Are you Danny's brother?
- Yeah.

896
01:01:14,706 --> 01:01:16,399
LIZZY: Tell him Lizzy's looking for him.

897
01:01:16,499 --> 01:01:18,709
Lizzy. Thank you.

898
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,492
We'll let the niggers, kikes and spics
grab for their piece of the pie.

899
01:01:25,592 --> 01:01:27,592
Can't blame them.

900
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:32,248
Of course,
they're gonna have to fight to get it.

901
01:01:32,348 --> 01:01:35,418
And if we scare the fuck out of people...

902
01:01:35,518 --> 01:01:40,193
...and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

903
01:01:40,315 --> 01:01:42,801
DEREK: You gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

904
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:46,778
Ha, ha. Hey, man.
- Well, look who's here.

905
01:01:46,946 --> 01:01:49,156
The return of the soldier.

906
01:01:50,325 --> 01:01:54,104
What are you doing here, Danny?
- Come on, man. I had to check it out.

907
01:01:54,204 --> 01:01:57,565
You knew I was gonna come.
CAMERON: Let the kid alone, Derek.

908
01:01:57,665 --> 01:01:59,960
He knows when to go to bed.

909
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:04,572
Go wait outside.
- Come on, I'm not doing anything.

910
01:02:04,672 --> 01:02:06,699
There's a little blond sitting out there.

911
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,036
She keeps asking for you.
She's dying. Come on.

912
01:02:10,136 --> 01:02:12,413
Well, I gotta check out.
- Go easy on her.

913
01:02:12,513 --> 01:02:14,513
All right.

914
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:20,521
Wait for me right outside.

915
01:02:24,984 --> 01:02:26,984
Take it easy.

916
01:02:27,362 --> 01:02:29,362
Chill out.

917
01:02:29,781 --> 01:02:31,781
You're on safe ground.

918
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,940
You don't have to watch your ass
around here.

919
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:38,789
Come on, sit down. Relax.

920
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,735
I'm sorry. The party was a little quick.

921
01:02:42,835 --> 01:02:46,447
But we're just so damned glad
you're back, Derek.

922
01:02:46,547 --> 01:02:49,993
It's only natural you should feel funny.
- I don't feel funny, Cam.

923
01:02:50,093 --> 01:02:55,081
You know, you made the fat kid nervous.
He thinks the joint messed with your mind.

924
01:02:55,181 --> 01:02:57,181
It did.

925
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:06,984
[SINGING] Glory, glory hallelujah

926
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:12,155
Glory, glory hallelujah

927
01:03:12,323 --> 01:03:15,534
The white man marches on

928
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:18,771
CAMERON: Things have changed
since you've been gone, Derek.

929
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:20,940
You talk about organization?

930
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,776
Wait till you see
what we've done with the Internet.

931
01:03:23,876 --> 01:03:27,614
We've got every gang from Seattle
to San Diego working together now.

932
01:03:27,714 --> 01:03:30,033
They're not competing.
They're consolidated.

933
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:33,286
Only thing we lack
is a little overall leadership.

934
01:03:33,386 --> 01:03:35,747
And that's where you come in.

935
01:03:35,847 --> 01:03:39,125
Because people out there
got a lot of respect for you, Derek.

936
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:43,880
When you're ready, talk to me about it.
- Well, you can forget about that.

937
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,632
I'm done with it, Cam.

938
01:03:45,732 --> 01:03:48,635
Yeah, well, I know you grew out of that...

939
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,138
...shaved-head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

940
01:03:52,238 --> 01:03:53,973
I like your hair the way it is now.

941
01:03:54,073 --> 01:03:56,559
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

942
01:03:56,659 --> 01:03:59,479
No more of this grocery store...
- You're not listening.

943
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:03,233
I am done with it. All that bullshit
out there and all your bullshit too.

944
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:04,692
I'm out.

945
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:07,904
I understand how you feel.
You've just done some hard time...

946
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:09,989
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.

947
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:12,283
You don't know a thing about it.
- I done mine.

948
01:04:12,383 --> 01:04:14,702
You didn't do shit.
I found out about your story.

949
01:04:14,802 --> 01:04:18,498
You did two months, then rolled over
on two kids and let them go down for you.

950
01:04:18,598 --> 01:04:22,253
So don't feed me your fucking lies,
Cameron.

951
01:04:22,268 --> 01:04:24,420
All right, then. This is stupid.

952
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,089
I'm done.

953
01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:29,008
Look, you go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

954
01:04:29,108 --> 01:04:31,511
Get your head on straight,
then I'll talk to you.

955
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:33,638
But it doesn't matter if I don't, does it?

956
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:36,099
You got the next crop
all lined up and ready to go...

957
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:39,352
...you fucking chicken hawk.
- Excuse me?

958
01:04:39,452 --> 01:04:41,980
You prey on people, Cam. You use them.

959
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,941
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause...

960
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:46,985
...but I am onto you,
you fucking snake.

961
01:04:47,085 --> 01:04:49,696
Hey, Derek. Watch it. Be careful.

962
01:04:49,796 --> 01:04:51,114
Remember where you are.

963
01:04:51,214 --> 01:04:54,826
This is not a fucking country club
where you can waltz in and out of here...

964
01:04:54,926 --> 01:04:56,661
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

965
01:04:56,761 --> 01:04:59,914
I came in here to tell you one thing:
I am out. Out.

966
01:05:00,014 --> 01:05:01,207
And Danny is out too.

967
01:05:01,307 --> 01:05:03,835
You come near my family again,
I'll fucking kill you.

968
01:05:03,935 --> 01:05:06,337
Well, excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

969
01:05:06,437 --> 01:05:08,673
You can't come barking threats at me.

970
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:11,384
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

971
01:05:11,484 --> 01:05:15,638
He's not some whining pussy like you.
He needs my help and I'll give it to him.

972
01:05:15,738 --> 01:05:17,515
If you come near Danny again...

973
01:05:17,615 --> 01:05:20,643
...I will feed you your fucking heart,
Cameron.

974
01:05:20,743 --> 01:05:22,743
I won't have to.

975
01:05:23,704 --> 01:05:25,704
He'll come to me.

976
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:29,861
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

01:05:33,005 --> 01:05:34,866

Hey, hey, hey. Where's Cameron?

982

Where the fuck is he?

Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Derek.

01:05:59,365 --> 01:06:01,142
Stay away from me, Stacey. Danny.

985
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:03,561
Why don't you share
what you just said to me...

986
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:06,522
...you piece-of-shit, race-trading nigger.

Are you a fucking nigger?

Hey, Danny. Come on.

There was six of them, they jumped me.

1324
01:31:08,998 --> 01:31:11,526
That won't happen again.
I hope they fucking try.

1325
01:31:11,626 --> 01:31:14,237
Look, I'm not talking about
your peckerwood friends.

1326
01:31:14,337 --> 01:31:16,614
They were protecting your stupid ass.

1327
01:31:16,714 --> 01:31:18,616
You dissed them in public.

1328
01:31:18,716 --> 01:31:20,827
Now you're on your fucking own.

1329
01:31:20,927 --> 01:31:23,204
Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers.

1330
01:31:23,304 --> 01:31:27,041
They're gonna fuck you, toss your salad,
then smoke your motherfucking ass.

1331
01:31:27,141 --> 01:31:31,129
Tell me something I don't already know.
You think I haven't thought about that?

1332
01:31:31,229 --> 01:31:36,584
They're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.

1333
01:31:36,734 --> 01:31:38,777
What can I do, man?

1334
01:31:42,991 --> 01:31:45,310
DEREK:
So I was right back where I started.

1335
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:48,470
Every day, I was sure it was my day.

1336
01:31:49,038 --> 01:31:51,524
Every time I stepped out of my cell.

1337
01:31:51,624 --> 01:31:54,344
Every time I got in that shower.

1338
01:31:57,255 --> 01:32:02,525
I figured it was only a matter of time
before they made a move.

1339
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,480
I just hoped that it'd be quick.

1340
01:32:36,794 --> 01:32:38,837
But it never came.

1341
01:32:40,256 --> 01:32:43,451
I couldn't figure it out.
I knew some of them were itching for it.

1342
01:32:43,551 --> 01:32:46,037
But after a while I just put my head down...

1343
01:32:46,137 --> 01:32:51,237
...read the stuff that Sweeney sent me,
and I kept to myself.

1344
01:32:52,143 --> 01:32:56,563
The last six months in that place
I was like a ghost.

1345
01:33:09,327 --> 01:33:12,047
What's up, man? You getting out?

1346
01:33:14,373 --> 01:33:19,218
What the fuck you waiting on?
Get the fuck on out of here.

1347
01:33:19,629 --> 01:33:24,575
Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

1348
01:33:24,675 --> 01:33:29,330
I'm thinking maybe the only reason
I'm getting out of here in one piece is you.

1349
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:31,541
Come on, man.
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1350
01:33:31,641 --> 01:33:34,287
You think I'm gonna put
my neck on the line...

1351
01:33:34,387 --> 01:33:35,920
...for a crazy-ass peckerwood?

1352
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:39,189
Yeah. Right. Stupid.

1353
01:33:45,071 --> 01:33:47,071
That's what I thought.

1354
01:33:51,077 --> 01:33:53,077
I owe you, man.

1355
01:33:53,871 --> 01:33:57,101
Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?

1356
01:33:58,543 --> 01:34:00,543
Yes, I do.

1357
01:34:10,346 --> 01:34:11,748
You'll be out in no time.

1358
01:34:11,848 --> 01:34:15,673
Come on, man.
It's a piece of cake. All right?

1359
01:34:16,269 --> 01:34:21,539
You just take it easy on the brothers,
all right? The brothers.

1360
01:34:29,782 --> 01:34:31,782
God, man.

1361
01:34:33,619 --> 01:34:35,912
I'm sorry, Der.

1362
01:34:36,247 --> 01:34:38,707
Sorry that happened to you.

1363
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:42,878
No, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1364
01:34:43,045 --> 01:34:44,697
I feel lucky because...

1365
01:34:44,797 --> 01:34:46,797
...it's wrong, Dan.

1366
01:34:48,467 --> 01:34:52,497
It's wrong and it was eating me up.
It was gonna kill me.

1367
01:34:52,597 --> 01:34:55,374
And I kept asking myself all the time...

1368
01:34:55,474 --> 01:34:58,959
...how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1369
01:35:00,104 --> 01:35:02,757
And it's just because I was pissed off.

1370
01:35:02,857 --> 01:35:07,107
And nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1371
01:35:07,695 --> 01:35:11,690
I mean, I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1372
01:35:12,783 --> 01:35:16,020
And that didn't make me feel any different.

1373
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:20,358
It just got me more lost.
And I'm tired of feeling pissed off, Danny.

1374
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:22,458
I'm just tired of it.

1375
01:35:23,461 --> 01:35:26,436
And I'm not telling you what to do.

1376
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:28,464
I'm really not.

1377
01:35:28,966 --> 01:35:31,431
But I need you to understand.

1378
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:36,460
Because I love you
and you're my best friend.

1379
01:35:38,267 --> 01:35:40,128
Do you understand?

1380
01:35:40,228 --> 01:35:42,228
Yeah, I understand.

1381
01:35:45,942 --> 01:35:47,942
All right.

1382
01:35:49,654 --> 01:35:50,888
Whoo.

1383
01:35:50,988 --> 01:35:52,988
Jesus.

1384
01:35:56,327 --> 01:35:58,328
[BOTH LAUGHING]...

1385
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:07,488
...[DORIS COUGHS]...

1386
01:36:07,588 --> 01:36:09,965
Hey.
- Hi.

1387
01:36:10,132 --> 01:36:12,493
Everything okay?
DEREK: No, everything's great.

1388
01:36:12,593 --> 01:36:15,246
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1389
01:36:15,346 --> 01:36:19,333
No, thank you. Yeah. This is good. I'm fine.
- You sure?

1390
01:36:19,433 --> 01:36:21,433
Thank you, though.

1391
01:36:21,435 --> 01:36:23,900
All right. Come on, let's go.

1392
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:46,333
[WHISPERS] Good night.

1393
01:37:52,943 --> 01:37:55,918
I'm gonna take a shower, all right?

1394
01:38:28,396 --> 01:38:32,883
DANNY: It's hard to look back
and see the truth about people you love.

1395
01:38:32,983 --> 01:38:37,221
I think if you asked Derek why it all went
the way it did, and where it all started...

1396
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:41,017
...he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

1397
01:38:41,117 --> 01:38:43,769
But the truth is, it started earlier.

1398
01:38:43,869 --> 01:38:46,814
All right. Are we all meeting together
for the game tonight?

1399
01:38:46,914 --> 01:38:48,316
Yes, definitely.

1400
01:38:48,416 --> 01:38:51,110
Ben's Burgers, 7:00,
then we go watch the big guy play.

1401
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:53,420
DORIS: Okay. Yeah.

1402
01:38:53,587 --> 01:38:57,074
Psyching up for the game?
- Yeah, I'm always ready for that.

1403
01:38:57,174 --> 01:39:01,245
I got an English exam third period.
I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.

1404
01:39:01,345 --> 01:39:04,040
What's the matter,
afraid you're gonna get a B?

1405
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,435
Might do you good. B minus.

1406
01:39:07,101 --> 01:39:08,919
Don't laugh. This guy is different.

1407
01:39:09,019 --> 01:39:13,549
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable.
I've never had a teacher like this.

1408
01:39:13,649 --> 01:39:16,510
He's got two Ph.D.s.
I don't know what he's doing at our school.

1409
01:39:16,610 --> 01:39:20,890
He's not like other teachers.
- What's he got you reading?

1410
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:23,434
We got this essay exam on this book,
Native Son.

1411
01:39:23,534 --> 01:39:26,103
All on this one book.
- Native Son. I don't know that.

1412
01:39:26,203 --> 01:39:28,668
DORIS: That's a big surprise.

1413
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:31,291
What? I read.

1414
01:39:31,459 --> 01:39:35,199
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy at school.

1415
01:39:36,464 --> 01:39:38,282
Well, they don't.

1416
01:39:38,382 --> 01:39:40,826
So, what is it? What is this Native Son?
What is it?

1417
01:39:40,926 --> 01:39:43,537
It's this book about this black guy.

1418
01:39:43,637 --> 01:39:46,749
We're doing this whole black literature unit.

1419
01:39:46,849 --> 01:39:48,793
What is it, Black History Month?

1420
01:39:48,893 --> 01:39:50,169
No, it's just like...

1421
01:39:50,269 --> 01:39:54,944
This guy Sweeney, you know,
it's part of the course now.

1422
01:39:56,192 --> 01:39:58,192
Yeah.

1423
01:39:59,904 --> 01:40:01,904
What?

1424
01:40:02,114 --> 01:40:04,058
Nothing. It's just, you know.

1425
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:06,453
It's everywhere I look now.

1426
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:09,119
What?

1427
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:12,373
This affirmative blaction.

1428
01:40:13,417 --> 01:40:18,489
Honey, a few new books
doesn't qualify as affirmative black action.

1429
01:40:18,589 --> 01:40:20,324
Read the book, ace the guy's test.

1430
01:40:20,424 --> 01:40:22,827
Just don't swallow everything
he feeds you whole.

1431
01:40:22,927 --> 01:40:25,496
Just because you see it on the news.
- But like what?

1432
01:40:25,596 --> 01:40:27,866
All this stuff about
making everything equal.

1433
01:40:27,966 --> 01:40:28,999
It's not that simple.

1434
01:40:29,099 --> 01:40:30,876
Now you got this book, Native Son.

1435
01:40:30,976 --> 01:40:33,170
What happened to the other books
in the course?

1436
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:37,383
They're not any good anymore because
Mr. Two-Ph.D. S says they aren't?

1437
01:40:37,483 --> 01:40:42,721
Are you gonna trade in great books
for black books? Does that make sense?

1438
01:40:42,821 --> 01:40:44,765
You gotta question these things, Derek.

1439
01:40:44,865 --> 01:40:46,934
You gotta look at the whole picture.

1440
01:40:47,034 --> 01:40:50,438
We're talking about books here.
But I'm also talking about my job.

1441
01:40:50,538 --> 01:40:53,899
I got two black guys on my squad now
who got their job...

1442
01:40:53,999 --> 01:40:58,821
...over a couple of white guys
who actually scored higher on the test.

1443
01:40:58,921 --> 01:41:02,700
That make sense? Huh?
Yeah, sure, everything's equal now...

1444
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,121
...but I got two guys watching my back,
responsible for my life...

1445
01:41:07,221 --> 01:41:10,958
...who aren't as good as two others.
They got the job because they were black.

1446
01:41:11,058 --> 01:41:13,919
Not because they were the best.
- That sucks.

1447
01:41:14,019 --> 01:41:16,005
DENNIS:
Yeah. Is that what America is about?

1448
01:41:16,105 --> 01:41:18,299
No. America's about 'best man for the job.'

1449
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:20,551
You do your best, you get the job.

1450
01:41:20,651 --> 01:41:24,013
You know, this affirmative action crap...

1451
01:41:24,113 --> 01:41:26,432
I don't know what that's about.
There's some...

1452
01:41:26,532 --> 01:41:29,226
...hidden agenda or something going on.

1453
01:41:29,326 --> 01:41:31,479
You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do.

1454
01:41:31,579 --> 01:41:34,064
I don't know,
I didn't think about it like that.

1455
01:41:34,164 --> 01:41:36,544
Well...
- This guy, though...

1456
01:41:36,709 --> 01:41:39,695
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on, like, so strong...

1457
01:41:39,795 --> 01:41:42,072
...it's kind of hard not to listen to him.

1458
01:41:42,172 --> 01:41:44,200
Maybe some of what he says is kind of...

1459
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,993
It's bullshit.

1460
01:41:46,093 --> 01:41:48,344
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1461
01:41:48,512 --> 01:41:50,164
No, no.

1462
01:41:50,264 --> 01:41:52,765
It's nigger bullshit.

1463
01:41:54,935 --> 01:41:57,570
You see that, don't you?
- Yeah.

1464
01:41:58,022 --> 01:42:03,802
You gotta watch out for that.
- Yeah, I get what you're saying. I will.

1465
01:42:03,902 --> 01:42:05,902
Good boy.

1466
01:42:06,655 --> 01:42:10,905
I'm proud of you.
- Don't worry about it. I got it.

1467
01:44:13,574 --> 01:44:15,059
DANNY: It's 5:40 a. M...

1468
01:44:15,159 --> 01:44:19,730
...and in about one minute,
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1469
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:22,890
I don't know if I've ever done that.

1470
01:44:23,125 --> 01:44:26,737
Anyway, we're gonna try
to pick things up and start over.

1471
01:44:26,837 --> 01:44:30,574
It won't be easy,
but we're all together again.

1472
01:44:30,674 --> 01:44:32,759
And I feel good.

1473
01:44:33,969 --> 01:44:36,372
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted.

1474
01:44:36,472 --> 01:44:40,584
If I hit the social significance,
or whatever you're looking for.

1475
01:44:40,684 --> 01:44:44,729
But, for what it's worth, thanks a lot.

1476
01:44:59,036 --> 01:45:01,454
Wow. You look great.

1477
01:45:01,622 --> 01:45:03,622
Look at you.

1478
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:07,611
Yeah. Gotta dress up for the parole officer.

1479
01:45:07,711 --> 01:45:09,196
Is she cute?

1480
01:45:09,296 --> 01:45:11,881
She is a fat guy named Hector.

1481
01:45:12,049 --> 01:45:14,049
So I'm out of luck.

1482
01:45:17,012 --> 01:45:20,708
I just gotta check in,
then I'll see about getting my old job back.

1483
01:45:20,808 --> 01:45:22,126
Great.

1484
01:45:22,226 --> 01:45:24,294
Good morning.
DORIS: Yes, my love.

1485
01:45:24,394 --> 01:45:28,340
Davina, can you...?
Your sister's gonna help you, honey.

1486
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,426
DAVINA: You look great. Knock them dead.
- Okay.

1487
01:45:30,526 --> 01:45:31,969
Thanks.

1488
01:45:32,069 --> 01:45:36,432
DAVINA: What would you like to wear?
ALLY: I wanna wear my blue dress today.

1489
01:45:36,532 --> 01:45:39,762
You do look good.
- Yeah? I feel silly.

1490
01:45:39,827 --> 01:45:42,037
You look good.
DEREK: Yeah?

1491
01:45:44,331 --> 01:45:46,331
You feel good?

1492
01:45:48,585 --> 01:45:51,671
Yeah. Yeah. I feel, you know...

1493
01:45:51,839 --> 01:45:53,923
...a little...

1494
01:45:54,091 --> 01:45:57,236
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1495
01:45:57,761 --> 01:46:00,888
Listen, I don't know...

1496
01:46:01,056 --> 01:46:04,456
I don't know if it's okay that I'm here.

1497
01:46:07,646 --> 01:46:09,897
I wanna be here.

1498
01:46:18,949 --> 01:46:21,074
[CAR TIRES SCREECHING]...

1499
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:30,256
I'm gonna get a paper.
- Cool.

1500
01:46:46,894 --> 01:46:49,588
What do you want?
- A maple bar and a large milk.

1501
01:46:49,688 --> 01:46:51,688
All right, I got it.

1502
01:46:56,361 --> 01:47:00,098
Let me get a coffee, a maple bar
and a large milk to go.

1503
01:47:00,198 --> 01:47:02,198
WAITER: Right away.

1504
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:12,171
RASMUSSEN: Hey, Derek.
- Hey.

1505
01:47:12,628 --> 01:47:13,904
Derek.

1506
01:47:14,004 --> 01:47:16,573
We need to talk.
- What's going on?

1507
01:47:16,673 --> 01:47:20,619
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1508
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:23,038
They were jumped last night.
- How bad?

1509
01:47:23,138 --> 01:47:25,457
Well, it looks like they're gonna live.

1510
01:47:25,557 --> 01:47:29,977
Then they got lucky.
- Somebody's gotta lose, though.

1511
01:47:31,855 --> 01:47:33,632
Aw, what?

1512
01:47:33,732 --> 01:47:36,927
We were kind of hoping that maybe
you'd talk to your old crew.

1513
01:47:37,027 --> 01:47:39,263
Come on. No way.
RASMUSSEN: This is not a good thing.

1514
01:47:39,363 --> 01:47:41,598
If there's anybody they'll listen to,
it's you.

1515
01:47:41,698 --> 01:47:44,017
No. No, I hate to tell you, but I'm out.

1516
01:47:44,117 --> 01:47:46,228
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1517
01:47:46,328 --> 01:47:48,272
We're asking for your help here, Derek.

1518
01:47:48,372 --> 01:47:52,197
Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
- Derek.

1519
01:47:57,047 --> 01:47:58,782
This has got nothing to do with me.

1520
01:47:58,882 --> 01:48:01,743
Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

1521
01:48:01,843 --> 01:48:04,621
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

1522
01:48:04,721 --> 01:48:07,291
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the clear.

1523
01:48:07,391 --> 01:48:09,918
Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.

1524
01:48:10,018 --> 01:48:14,006
It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1525
01:48:14,106 --> 01:48:16,425
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

1526
01:48:16,525 --> 01:48:19,415
The way to find peace is to stick.

1527
01:48:19,736 --> 01:48:22,139
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

1528
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:24,239
It might.

1529
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,644
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you?

1530
01:48:27,744 --> 01:48:32,316
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

1531
01:48:32,416 --> 01:48:33,817
[SIGHS]

1532
01:48:33,917 --> 01:48:35,917
Man.

1533
01:48:37,212 --> 01:48:39,212
Fuck.

1534
01:48:43,677 --> 01:48:45,677
All right.

1535
01:48:47,431 --> 01:48:49,458
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1536
01:48:49,558 --> 01:48:52,268
I doubt it.
- Yeah, well...

1537
01:48:52,436 --> 01:48:55,881
...we're all gonna have a laugh at that,
let me tell you.

1538
01:48:55,981 --> 01:48:59,301
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1539
01:48:59,401 --> 01:49:00,844
Come on.

1540
01:49:00,944 --> 01:49:04,306
SWEENEY: Hey, you. You got
something good for me this morning?

1541
01:49:04,406 --> 01:49:09,251
I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.

1542
01:49:12,289 --> 01:49:14,289
DANNY: What's going on?

1543
01:49:19,296 --> 01:49:21,296
Come on.

1544
01:49:36,646 --> 01:49:39,648
This is so bad for Seth, man.

1545
01:49:39,816 --> 01:49:43,053
I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.

1546
01:49:43,153 --> 01:49:46,890
I'm glad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

1547
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:48,350
Should we visit them?

1548
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:50,644
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

1549
01:49:50,744 --> 01:49:53,146
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1550
01:49:53,246 --> 01:49:55,107
Listen, too...

1551
01:49:55,207 --> 01:49:59,319
...I saw a car cruising by the house last
night when I pulled out of there with Seth.

1552
01:49:59,419 --> 01:50:02,280
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

1553
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:05,355
Make sure there's nothing going on.

1554
01:50:05,759 --> 01:50:07,759
Oh, man. This is bad.

1555
01:50:10,055 --> 01:50:13,000
They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.

1556
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:14,835
If I made it through Chino...

1557
01:50:14,935 --> 01:50:18,521
...this should be a piece of cake, right?

1558
01:50:18,688 --> 01:50:21,857
Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1559
01:50:23,276 --> 01:50:25,276
Okay.

1560
01:50:25,278 --> 01:50:26,805
What are you gonna do?

1561
01:50:26,905 --> 01:50:28,724
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

1562
01:50:28,824 --> 01:50:31,018
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

1563
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:33,118
It's gonna be fine.

1564
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,120
Go turn that paper in.

1565
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:40,525
Okay. All right, see you.
- Hey, hey, Dan.

1566
01:50:47,551 --> 01:50:49,551
I'll see you at home.

1567
01:50:51,096 --> 01:50:52,956
All right?

1568
01:50:53,056 --> 01:50:54,374
Yeah, I'll see you.

1569
01:50:54,474 --> 01:50:56,918
Hey, good luck, all right?
- Yeah.

1570
01:50:57,018 --> 01:50:59,018
See you later.

1571
01:50:59,146 --> 01:51:02,148
[BELL RINGING]...

1572
01:51:04,484 --> 01:51:06,511
We're gonna be late.
DANNY: We'd better go.

1573
01:51:06,611 --> 01:51:09,196
Okay.
- All right. Come on.

1574
01:51:32,262 --> 01:51:35,332
Fine.
- All right. I'll catch up with you, all right?

1575
01:51:35,432 --> 01:51:37,432
See you later.

1576
01:52:57,555 --> 01:52:59,040
Derek, no.
- Get out of my way.

1577
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:01,293
All right. All right.
- Get out of my way.

1578
01:53:01,393 --> 01:53:03,393
Let him go.

1579
01:53:04,479 --> 01:53:08,524
Oh, no. No. No. No.

1580
01:53:08,858 --> 01:53:11,026
Oh, Jesus.

1581
01:53:13,655 --> 01:53:15,655
No.

1582
01:53:15,699 --> 01:53:19,868
Oh, no, no. No.

1583
01:53:34,426 --> 01:53:36,203
Oh, Jesus.

1584
01:53:36,303 --> 01:53:38,470
God, what did I do?

1585
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:56,322
Oh, God.

1586
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:09,945
DANNY: So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1587
01:54:10,045 --> 01:54:12,421
My conclusion, right?

1588
01:54:13,256 --> 01:54:15,381
Well, my conclusion is...

1589
01:54:15,508 --> 01:54:17,509
...hate is baggage.

1590
01:54:17,761 --> 01:54:21,498
Life's too short to be pissed off all the time.

1591
01:54:21,598 --> 01:54:23,598
It's just not worth it.

1592
01:54:26,269 --> 01:54:29,798
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1593
01:54:29,898 --> 01:54:32,008
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1594
01:54:32,108 --> 01:54:36,680
...so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.

1595
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:40,095
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1596
01:54:41,034 --> 01:54:44,411
'We are not enemies, but friends.

1597
01:54:44,579 --> 01:54:46,997
We must not be enemies.

1598
01:54:47,165 --> 01:54:49,442
Though passion may have strained...

1599
01:54:49,542 --> 01:54:52,862
...it must not break our bonds of affection.

1600
01:54:52,962 --> 01:54:57,867
The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched...

1601
01:54:57,967 --> 01:55:03,237
...as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature.'
