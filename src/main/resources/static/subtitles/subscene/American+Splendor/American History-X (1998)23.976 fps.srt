1
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,896
Derek.

2
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:06,523
Derek.

3
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:09,901
- Fucking pervert, Dan.
- Jesus, what the fuck are you thinking?

4
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,904
There's a black guy outside.
He's breaking into your car.

5
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,700
- How long's he been there?
- I don't know.

6
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:19,244
- What's going on?
- Not right now, honey. How many?

7
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:23,081
- Danny, how many?
- One, I think.

8
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:25,167
- Is he strapped?
- Huh?

9
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:28,336
- Does he have a fucking gun, Danny?
- Man, I don't fucking know.

10
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:32,424
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on, Derek?

11
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,342
- Stay right here and be quiet.
- Jesus.

12
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,262
- Stay right here.
- Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

13
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,889
Derek.

14
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,642
Shh, shh, shh.

15
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,311
They're right here.

16
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,539
I don't have a personal problem
with him, okay?

17
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:30,250
Don't insult my intelligence, Murray.

18
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:33,211
You hate this child
and I think I know why.

19
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:42,929
I went out with his mother a few times.

20
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:45,223
That was three years ago. It was nothing.

21
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:46,725
Nothing. Really? Hmm.

22
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:50,020
That paper, Bob, it's a travesty.

23
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:53,064
Arguing for Hitler as a civil-rights hero?

24
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:54,649
You've gotta draw the line.

25
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:56,901
Murray, you actually did this to yourself.

26
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,529
You told them they could
do a report on any book..

27
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:02,907
that related to the struggle
for civil rights. In plain English.

28
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,747
I am not disputing the fact that the child
is confused and harbors some sick ideas..

29
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:11,541
but I am not ready
to give up on him yet.

30
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:14,336
His brother probably put him up to it.

31
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:18,506
I can guarantee you 100 percent
his brother did not put him up to this.

32
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:21,009
I find that hard to believe. Whatever.

33
00:07:21,177 --> 00:07:24,262
I know he was a good kid
and it's a shame what he's been through..

34
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,681
- ..but that is dangerous.
- Dangerous in what way?

35
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:29,517
Bob, that goes too far.

36
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:33,313
This racist propaganda,
this Mein Kampf psychobabble?

37
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:36,399
He learned this nonsense, Murray,
and he can unlearn it too.

38
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,235
I will not give up on this child yet.

39
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,923
- I knew it was you.
- Danny, get in here.

40
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:04,135
I said, get in here. Get in here!

41
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:05,929
Five, four, three..

42
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,890
two.. Shut the door.

43
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:13,603
What's it gonna be, Danny?

44
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:16,064
What's what gonna be?

45
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:18,650
This petty crap you're pulling.

46
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:21,653
I don't know.

47
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:23,363
Have a seat.

48
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:31,454
How you doing?

49
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:35,083
Fine.

50
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:37,502
Things at home okay?

51
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:39,879
Yeah.

52
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,176
Derek got out this morning, did he not?

53
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,180
Yeah, he did.

54
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:52,684
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

55
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:56,521
Honors English.
He was a brilliant student.

56
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:00,859
Like you. But he hung out
with simple-minded fools.

57
00:09:01,026 --> 00:09:03,194
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Also like you.

58
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:05,822
Look, did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

59
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,199
Because what happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

60
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,870
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

61
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:14,622
Look, I followed directions
and I wrote an A paper.

62
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,876
"Mein Kampf"?

63
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:21,379
- I should expel you.
- Go ahead.

64
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:25,550
- You don't think I could handle it?
- No, I think the street would kill you.

65
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:29,387
Your rhetoric and your propaganda
aren't gonna save you out there.

66
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:32,807
So here's the drill.

67
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,518
I'm your history teacher from now on.

68
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:39,230
We will discuss current events.

69
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,816
We will call this class..

70
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,737
American History X.

71
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:48,740
We meet once a day.

72
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:53,578
All right, your first assignment is to
prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.

73
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:57,373
Oh, come on. It took me a week
to read Mein Kampf. That isn't fair.

74
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:10,345
- What do you want me to do it on?
- Your brother.

75
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,765
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

76
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,100
No, no, no. I'm not kidding.

77
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:21,606
I want you to analyze and interpret all the
events surrounding Derek's incarceration.

78
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,401
How these events helped shape
your present perspective..

79
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:28,988
concerning life
in contemporary America.

80
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,907
The impact on your life.

81
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:33,159
Your family's.

82
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,830
Whatever you wanna say, Danny..

83
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:43,294
I'll be the only one reading it.

84
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:46,965
But if it's not on my desk..

85
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:48,925
tomorrow morning..

86
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:52,971
you are a ghost at Venice Beach High.

87
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,140
Are you clear?

88
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:59,102
Yeah, I'm clear.

89
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,150
Telling teacher I'm fucking cheating?

90
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:08,444
Is that what's happening?

91
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:11,739
- I never cheated in my life.
- Beat his motherfucking ass, Henry.

92
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:14,659
- I didn't say anything.
- Why you tripping on me?

93
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:19,664
Why you all kicking him like that?

94
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:21,499
What's up, man?

95
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:24,836
What you scared for?
I ain't gonna do nothing.

96
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:33,886
What's up?

97
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:38,182
Want some too, bitch?
Punk. What's wrong with you?

98
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,143
You wanna die?

99
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,438
Punk-ass white boy.

100
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:53,197
You lucky I gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

101
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:56,242
He don't wanna see me and the heater.

102
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:01,039
Lucky the bell rung.
I would have clocked that white boy.

103
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:02,665
Punk-ass motherfucker.

104
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,875
We'd smoke that fool.

105
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:07,378
You gotta fucking stand up for yourself.

106
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:25,104
We got a whole file on skinheads.

107
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:28,232
- These all part of the same gang?
- Venice Beach Gang.

108
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,818
- Where's my buddy?
- He's doing a stretch at YA.

109
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:33,321
- This guy C.C.?
- Mm-hm.

110
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:36,074
- That him?
- Yeah, that's him right there.

111
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:41,245
This morning we have a guest coming in,
and there he is.

112
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:43,456
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

113
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:45,249
- Good to see you, pal.
- Morning.

114
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:47,543
Gentlemen, this here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

115
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:50,088
He's principal over at Venice Beach High.

116
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:55,009
He's been doing outreach work with gangs,
both in and out of the can.

117
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:57,679
Three years ago,
a local kid named Derek Vinyard..

118
00:12:57,846 --> 00:13:01,349
was sent up for murdering two Crips
who were trying to jack his car.

119
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:05,937
Bob taught Vinyard back in high school
and he's followed the case closely.

120
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,731
He was a skinhead, right?

121
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:13,069
He was more like the skinhead.
The protégé of Cameron Alexander.

122
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:15,947
- Who?
- Cameron Alexander.

123
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:18,282
Here you go. Have a look-see.

124
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:20,618
Cameron Alexander, well..

125
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,370
he's a Venice Beach landmark.

126
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:26,124
He's probably the biggest distributor
of white-power literature and videos..

127
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,375
in L.A. County.

128
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:30,044
He promotes white-power bands.
He writes reviews.

129
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:33,131
And, uh, in his spare time
this guy even writes hate columns.

130
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:34,590
Does he have a record?

131
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:35,967
He's pretty clean.

132
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,761
Been trying to pin something to him,
but it doesn't work.

133
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:41,639
Trust me. He's behind all of it.

134
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:44,100
He runs everything out of his house
down by the beach.

135
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,310
No white gangs in Venice Beach..

136
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:48,813
before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

137
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:51,983
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

138
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:56,154
Essentially, he used Derek
to recruit a slew of insecure..

139
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,322
frustrated and impressionable kids.

140
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,160
This kid Vinyard, well,
he's got a lot of baggage..

141
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:06,289
as you'll see in this tape
that we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

142
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,923
L.A. County firefighter Dennis Vinyard..

143
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:19,594
was shot and killed battling a blaze
at a suspected Compton drug den.

144
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,512
We're at the Vinyard home right now..

145
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,683
and Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son,
Derek, has agreed to talk with us.

146
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:29,645
Derek, if you could come down here,
please, for just a second.

147
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:33,691
Look, I know this is tough,
but, um, how do you feel right now?

148
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,360
How do you think I feel?

149
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,740
- I think it's typical.
- Typical, how?

150
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:44,619
This country's becoming a haven
for criminals, so, what do you expect?

151
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:47,038
Decent, hardworking Americans
like my dad..

152
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:50,291
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

153
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,126
Parasites?

154
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:55,797
Blacks, browns, yellow, whatever.

155
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:57,089
I don't understand.

156
00:14:57,257 --> 00:14:59,383
You're saying your father's murder
was race-related?

157
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:01,385
Yeah, it's race-related.

158
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:05,181
Every problem in this country
is race-related, not just crime.

159
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:09,101
Immigration, AIDS, welfare. Those are
problems of the black community..

160
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:12,230
the Hispanic community,
Asian community. Not white problems.

161
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,398
Aren't those issues
that deal more with poverty?

162
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:18,486
No. They're not products of their
environments, either. That's crap.

163
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:20,863
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

164
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:23,449
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

165
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:26,869
Millions of white European-Americans
came here and flourished.

166
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:30,081
Within a generation. What the fuck
is the matter with these people?

167
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:32,834
They have to go around
shooting at firemen.

168
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:38,130
- What does this have
to do with your father?
- My father was murdered doing his job.

169
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:40,424
Putting out a fire
in a nigger neighborhood..

170
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:42,426
he shouldn't have given
a shit about.

171
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:46,264
He got shot by a fucking drug dealer
who probably collects a welfare check.

172
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,224
- That's enough.
- I'm sorry.

173
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:51,269
Derek Vinyard was released
from Chino earlier this morning..

174
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:53,646
after serving three and some-odd years.

175
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:56,357
I think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

176
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,317
If something happens to him..

177
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,945
things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

178
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,363
Just keep it low.

179
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:06,784
Venice Beach didn't always look like this.

180
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,370
It used to be a great neighborhood.

181
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,372
The boardwalk's always been a dump..

182
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,416
but when my dad moved us out here..

183
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:16,085
Venice was a nice, quiet place
to grow up.

184
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,715
Over the years, though,
it's just gone to hell.

185
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:22,967
The gangs are like a plague.

186
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:25,845
They moved west from Inglewood
and South Central..

187
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,430
and basically took over.

188
00:16:27,598 --> 00:16:29,891
It ain't fouling you.
What's wrong with you?

189
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:34,395
Fuck all y'all.

190
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:38,482
I ain't got time for all the bullshit.

191
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:40,484
Fuck y'all.

192
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:42,945
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

193
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:47,199
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

194
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:49,827
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.

195
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:57,460
Yeah, man, that's him.

196
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:08,346
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

197
00:17:08,513 --> 00:17:10,681
That's why Derek started the D.O.C.

198
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:15,186
He said white kids shouldn't have to walk
around scared in their own neighborhood.

199
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:19,273
For a while there, he really made it
like it was ours again.

200
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:21,859
- Throw the ball. Throw the ball.
- Come on, Seth. Block.

201
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:25,863
Come on, Curtis. Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

202
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:28,366
- Pass that thing.
- D up.

203
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,534
- Here we go.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

204
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:31,744
Come on.

205
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:36,040
Look at this fucking jungle bunny. He
does a spin move every time. Every time.

206
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:41,003
- You ain't getting shit, motherfucker.
- Over here. Over here.

207
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:42,546
This one's for you, boy!

208
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:45,716
- Fuck you..?
- Stop that.

209
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:47,343
Who you calling a boy, motherfucker?

210
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:50,805
You lucky motherfucker! I'm through
monkeying around with your ass!

211
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:53,432
You pale, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker..

212
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,559
a hundred bucks say
I make you my bitch.

213
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:02,566
Hear that? He's trying to make ends meet
for his cut in welfare. You're fucking on!

214
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:07,738
- It's 8-6, Seth.
- When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.

215
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:10,408
Come on, guys, I can't cover this.
Help me out here.

216
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:13,911
- You have a big fucking mouth, Seth.
- I can take this niglet down.

217
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,497
You can't take a shit.
The fuck are you thinking?

218
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:19,417
- I will beat him. Give me the money.
- Shut up. Shut up.

219
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:21,836
You're gonna fucking embarrass us.
Shut up!

220
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:31,345
I'll take care of this.

221
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:34,515
Hey.

222
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,935
I got a bet.

223
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:43,691
I come in this game right now. Same score,
but we play black guys against white guys.

224
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:46,944
Motherfucker.

225
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:49,030
Oh, shit.

226
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:51,073
Name your price, cracker.

227
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,409
No money. No money. For these courts.

228
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,369
And not just today. For good.

229
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:59,749
If you win, we will walk away.
But if we win..

230
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,043
no bitching, no fighting..

231
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,130
here in front of everybody, pack your
shit and get your black asses out of here.

232
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,215
Man, fuck that. Take this bet, man.

233
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:09,759
Eight to six, our ball.

234
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:12,887
Let's go.

235
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,153
Pick him up. Pick him up.

236
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:37,453
Seth, get back and play some D!

237
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:39,413
Come on, Seth.

238
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,334
Come on, let's go.

239
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:54,303
All right. Defense!

240
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:02,812
All right.

241
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:05,189
Pass the fucking ball, I was wide open.

242
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,402
Damn!

243
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:12,780
Let's go. Let's go, yo. Let's go.

244
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:14,615
Pick, pick, Derek!

245
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:21,956
Bullshit! That's offense.

246
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:25,334
- Get out of here. He moved his feet.
- If you want to go, I'm ready!

247
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:26,961
- Don't throw elbows!
- Want to go?

248
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,213
Adolf Hitler-wannabe motherfucker?
What?

249
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:32,716
Kill that motherfucker! Dead!

250
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:34,552
Chill out, bro. Chill out.

251
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:38,055
- Wait, it's cool. It's cool.
- Relax.

252
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:43,144
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just give me some water.

253
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:47,064
- You gotta call offense on that shit, Der.
- Not on game point, Danny.

254
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:49,358
You can't let niggers
get away with that shit.

255
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:53,320
- Honey, it's game point.
- Shut them down, Derek. Kick some ass.

256
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:55,072
Watch this.

257
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:27,605
Get that ball.

258
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:30,024
Pass the ball, baby. Pass the ball.

259
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:37,698
Yeah!

260
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:49,460
Bye-bye.

261
00:21:49,628 --> 00:21:51,462
Get the fuck off my court.

262
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,881
- This is my house.
- Fuck you, bitch.

263
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,929
- What happened?
- I dropped the ball!

264
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:01,138
Yeah!

265
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:10,648
Get the fuck out of here!
This is my court! Yes!

266
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,072
Yeah.

267
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:22,785
Derek wouldn't let us visit him in prison.

268
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,995
He said it would make it
too hard for him..

269
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:28,332
and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

270
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,752
Three years without him,
just wondering..

271
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:36,674
and then at 7:00 this morning..

272
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:39,426
we picked him up outside the gate.

273
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:44,473
- Come on, Danny.
- Der.

274
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:48,143
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

275
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:52,856
I wanted to stay home, but he said,
"No, go to school. I'll see you later."

276
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:08,664
Oh, come on. Give the guy a break.

277
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:11,041
What's the matter?
You too big to give me a hug?

278
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:12,251
No, man.

279
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,463
I just know you'll need someone to look after
you while you adjust to all this space.

280
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:17,965
Yeah, right.

281
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:21,719
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

282
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:24,221
- How you doing? How's school?
- It's good. It's good.

283
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:27,391
You gotta do something about that hair.
That 'do has gotta go.

284
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,686
- I don't know. The girls like it, so..
- Well, I don't.

285
00:23:30,854 --> 00:23:33,105
You're keeping it pretty close.
All the way down, huh?

286
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:34,815
Yeah.

287
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,860
Shit, look, I forgot, man.

288
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:42,072
- It hurt like shit while they put it on.
- When did you get that?

289
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,616
I got it about a month ago.

290
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:46,201
Cameron made it official.

291
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:49,371
- Cameron?
- Yeah.

292
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:53,584
- He put this on you?
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

293
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:59,256
- Hello?
- What?

294
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:00,924
Hi. Just hang on a second.

295
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:03,177
Derek, it's for you.

296
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,721
Nothing. Nothing.

297
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,306
- There a phone in the back?
- Mm-hm.

298
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,141
I'll get it in the back.

299
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,484
I got it.

300
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,944
Yeah? Oh, hey.

301
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,074
What?

302
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:29,953
My eyes have seen the glory
Of the trampling at the zoo

303
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:35,292
We washed ourselves in niggers' blood
And all the mongrels' too

304
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,464
We're taking down the ZOG machine
Jew by Jew, by Jew

305
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:44,134
The white man marches on

306
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:47,388
You think our friend was behind that?

307
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:50,474
You know what? I don't even care.

308
00:24:50,642 --> 00:24:52,434
I'm gonna take care of that tonight.

309
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:53,936
Mwah.

310
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:56,146
My sweet kid. My baby boy.

311
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:59,316
God, what's with the love fest, you guys?

312
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:07,991
No, he'll do it.
He'll do it. I'll make sure he does it.

313
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:10,494
I'll get it.

314
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,837
- Came to see the man.
- Can you fit through the door?

315
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:21,505
Fuck you!

316
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:25,092
- Seth.
- What's up, Dan?

317
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:27,219
How you doing? Where's Derek?

318
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:28,429
He's on the phone.

319
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:31,974
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Vinyard, where the fuck are you?

320
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:33,809
- Vinyard!
- Hang on.

321
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:36,019
- Give me a minute.
- Vinyard!

322
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:38,480
No, I'll be out in a minute.

323
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:57,875
I'm being careful. What am I gonna do? I
won't stay in my room the rest of my life.

324
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:00,127
Hold on.

325
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:03,464
Hey. Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

326
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:05,841
Did you invite him over?

327
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:08,635
No, he always comes over here.

328
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:11,555
All right. Danny, give me a minute.

329
00:26:12,682 --> 00:26:14,850
Just give me one minute.

330
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,819
Yeah.

331
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:35,496
God, are you still here, Goodyear?

332
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:39,666
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

333
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:44,254
When was the last time
you were able to see your feet?

334
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,675
Come in here, Danny.

335
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:52,262
Seth.

336
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:55,516
Hey, man,
you going to Cam's party tonight?

337
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:57,601
Is Davina's ass watertight?

338
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:00,062
You're fucking sick, man.

339
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,106
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

340
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:06,193
I'm not in the mood.
I got homework to do.

341
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:09,947
Tell me some of the shit you've learned,
fuck-ass, before I pistol-whip you.

342
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:15,285
Okay. I believe in death, destruction,
chaos, filth and greed.

343
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:19,122
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what I wanna hear, asshole.

344
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:25,128
- You mean that shit about your mother?
- You wanna get fucking beaten, Danny?

345
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:30,133
I'm not fucking talking to you, Davina.
Why don't you shut up?

346
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:33,345
Look, you got to let me do this
my own way, all right?

347
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:36,306
I'll take care of it.

348
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:38,517
Who do you hate, Danny?

349
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:41,395
I hate anyone that isn't white Protestant.

350
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:42,771
Why?

351
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,440
They're a burden to the advancement
of the white race.

352
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:49,945
- Some of them are all right, I guess.
- None of them are fucking all right, Danny.

353
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:52,781
They're all fucking freeloaders.
Remember what Cam said?

354
00:27:52,949 --> 00:27:56,785
"We don't know them. We don't wanna
know them. They're the fucking enemy."

355
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,957
What don't you like about them?
And say it with some fucking conviction.

356
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,252
I hate the fact that it's cool
to be black these days.

357
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,921
- Good.
- I hate this hip-hop..

358
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:10,507
fucking influence
on white fucking suburbia.

359
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:13,510
- Good.
- And I hate Tabitha Soren..

360
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:16,054
and all her Zionist MTV fucking pigs..

361
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:17,931
telling us we should get along.

362
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,809
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton..

363
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:22,853
because it ain't gonna fucking happen.

364
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:25,689
That's the best shit I've heard
come out of your mouth.

365
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:28,525
Danny, no. I feel sorry for you, Danny.

366
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:30,110
I know you don't believe that.

367
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,613
- Shut up, Davina!
- No, you shut the fuck up!

368
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,365
Get out of the house, you piece of shit!
Please go.

369
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,326
Is that any way to talk to a guest?

370
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:38,577
A friend of the family?

371
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:42,497
- Derek hates you and you don't realize it.
- Hey, how do you know who I hate?

372
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:44,666
Fucking A. Back from the dead.

373
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,336
God bless Jesus Christ, man.

374
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:51,131
I think you lost weight, man. I can get
my arms almost all the way around you.

375
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:55,385
Fifty fucking pounds, man.
Jesus, look at this hair. Holy shit.

376
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:58,555
- Yeah, I told him it's gotta go.
- It's good to have you back.

377
00:28:58,723 --> 00:29:01,224
Grab your jacket,
let's get the fuck out of here.

378
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:03,560
All right. I wanna talk to him one second.

379
00:29:03,728 --> 00:29:04,895
Look..

380
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:07,314
Hey, uh, listen..

381
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,566
did you pull some shit
in school today?

382
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:13,070
- No, just the usual.
- I'm telling you, man, this kid is awesome.

383
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:16,740
- Did you turn in a paper on Mein Kampf?
- Yeah.

384
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:18,116
- Awesome.
- You should've..

385
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:20,661
- Sweeney probably shit his pants.
- He did, man.

386
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:23,538
Did Cameron put you up to that?
Did he tell you to do that?

387
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:26,875
No, man, I thought it would be cool.
How'd you know, though?

388
00:29:27,043 --> 00:29:28,752
- How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter how.

389
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,088
This kid is smart as hell.

390
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:33,173
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

391
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:35,050
Yeah, Sweeney called.

392
00:29:35,218 --> 00:29:37,052
What are you talking to Sweeney for?

393
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,513
- Relax. Listen.
- He's got to get a fucking life.

394
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:42,432
- He pisses me off.
- Sweeney's a good teacher, all right?

395
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,227
Sweeney is a nigger on a power trip,
Vinyard.

396
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:47,479
That's what he was like
when we were there.

397
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:50,565
- And it'll never change. Fuck that nigger!
- Hey, Seth.

398
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,276
- Seth, go away. Go away.
- What? Are you kidding?

399
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:56,822
Go wait in Danny's room. I wanna
talk to my brother. I'm glad to see you.

400
00:29:56,989 --> 00:29:59,533
- I'll be there in one minute.
- Hurry up. I'm starving.

401
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:05,706
Come here. Seriously, look..

402
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:09,459
Forget this yahoo. He kills bugs for a living.
You don't wanna be like that.

403
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:11,628
I'm serious. It's not funny.

404
00:30:11,796 --> 00:30:13,922
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn from him.

405
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,299
So don't fuck it up
with small-fry shit like that.

406
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:17,968
You got to be smarter than that.

407
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:20,804
You gotta see the bullshit paper
he's making me write.

408
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:23,432
I know about it. He told me about it.
I don't care.

409
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,143
Do it. You do anything he tells
you to do. I mean it.

410
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:29,187
I don't want you in trouble in school,
trying to impress me..

411
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,606
taking this shit in there, all right?

412
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:33,442
Do you understand what I'm saying?

413
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,986
I guess, but I was doing it
because I thought you'd be happy.

414
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:39,281
Well, I'm not.

415
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:43,118
Shit. Listen to that.

416
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:45,662
Yeah, I know. It's been getting worse.

417
00:30:46,414 --> 00:30:49,499
All right, don't worry about it.
I'll talk to you about this later.

418
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:51,334
- Okay.
- Later.

419
00:30:52,795 --> 00:30:56,381
She's coughing her lungs out and you're
blowing this shit in her face all day.

420
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:58,049
- Put it out.
- I'm putting it out.

421
00:30:58,217 --> 00:30:59,342
All right. Come on.

422
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,596
Hey. Come on, I wanna talk to you.

423
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:09,603
Mommy, are you okay?

424
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:17,152
What are you doing? Put that out.

425
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,363
I'm yelling at him for blowing smoke
and you're here sucking on it.

426
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:22,324
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

427
00:31:22,492 --> 00:31:24,075
Yeah.

428
00:31:25,203 --> 00:31:28,663
You all right?

429
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:36,296
Look..

430
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:38,965
you gotta take it easy.
You gotta get some rest.

431
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:42,385
I want you to take Danny's and my room
and we'll hit the couch.

432
00:31:42,553 --> 00:31:46,097
- Couch is fine for now.
- No, it's not fine. It's not. This is terrible.

433
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:48,225
We can't live like this.

434
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,435
We gotta get out of here.

435
00:31:52,063 --> 00:31:54,147
Can I go with you?

436
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,692
Yeah, we all gotta get out of here.
That's the point.

437
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,236
I could drop out of school.

438
00:31:59,403 --> 00:32:03,240
No. No, absolutely not. You gotta finish.
I'll work something out.

439
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:11,331
Derek, can we please go eat?
I'm fucking starving here.

440
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,583
I don't give a shit!
Go wait in the living room!

441
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:16,253
- God.
- I want him out of my house.

442
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,964
I know, I know. Look.

443
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:36,398
He's an idiot. He's always been an idiot.

444
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:39,276
Whatever, dude. He can't help it.
I gotta do that paper.

445
00:32:39,443 --> 00:32:41,778
Look, I'm gonna catch up with you
later tonight.

446
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:44,865
Not at Cameron's, all right?
I need you to stay away from there.

447
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:48,410
- Why? I thought we were gonna hang.
- Trust me. I'll explain it later.

448
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:51,538
I need you to stay away from the party,
all right?

449
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,206
- Whatever.
- Hey, I'm not kidding.

450
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:55,458
Promise me you'll stay
away from that party.

451
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:58,044
I'm not fucking 14 anymore, all right?

452
00:32:59,171 --> 00:33:00,547
Whatever.

453
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:04,009
God!

454
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:11,308
Come on, let's go.

455
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:15,645
- Where are you parked?
- Out back.

456
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,676
- Yeah, that's the whole bunch.
- Right.

457
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:30,470
It didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself.

458
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:32,764
And Cameron knew just how to use it.

459
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:34,891
You sure you don't wanna
stick around?

460
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:37,227
You know I'd love to..

461
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:38,895
but I gotta be careful.

462
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:40,230
Yeah, I know.

463
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:43,900
- We'll see you back at the house, then.
- Right.

464
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:45,568
- All right.
- Good luck.

465
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:47,821
He sent Derek to the kids..

466
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,572
to the frustrated ones.

467
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,910
The ones who were sick of getting their
asses kicked by black & Mexican gangs.

468
00:34:54,078 --> 00:34:55,412
Don't just be some punk..

469
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:56,830
be part of something.

470
00:34:57,373 --> 00:34:59,499
All right, let's go. Pull it together.

471
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:04,295
And everybody ate it up.
They did whatever Derek told them to.

472
00:35:04,922 --> 00:35:07,215
Let's go. Come on,
we're not here to fucking socialize.

473
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:11,511
- Shut the fuck up.
- Check this shit out, man.

474
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,598
You want a little toke? Huh? Go ahead.

475
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:18,226
- Curtis, what is that?
- Aw, come on, Derek.

476
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:20,603
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

477
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:23,773
- Aw, Jesus fucking Christ.
- Have a little self-respect.

478
00:35:25,776 --> 00:35:29,320
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

479
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,952
There's over 2 million illegal immigrants
bedding down in this state tonight.

480
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:40,665
This state spent $3 billion last year..

481
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:44,210
on services for people who had
no right to be here in the first place.

482
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:45,795
Three billion dollars.

483
00:35:45,963 --> 00:35:51,009
400 million dollars just to lock up
a bunch of illegal immigrant criminals..

484
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:54,054
who only got into this country
because the INS decided..

485
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:57,932
it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

486
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:03,563
Who gives a shit?
Our government doesn't give a shit.

487
00:36:04,982 --> 00:36:06,816
Our border policy is a joke.

488
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,071
So is anybody surprised that south
of the border they're laughing at us?

489
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,989
- Laughing at our laws.
- Yeah.

490
00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:15,992
Every night these parasites
stream across the border..

491
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,744
like some fucking pinata exploded.

492
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:19,079
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Don't laugh!

493
00:36:20,164 --> 00:36:23,583
There's nothing funny going on here.
This is about your life and mine.

494
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,046
It's about decent, hardworking Americans
falling through the cracks..

495
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:30,757
and getting the shaft.
The government cares about..

496
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:35,428
the constitutional rights of a bunch of
people who aren't citizens of this country!

497
00:36:35,596 --> 00:36:39,557
On the Statue of Liberty, it says, "Give
me your tired, your hungry, your poor."

498
00:36:39,725 --> 00:36:42,310
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

499
00:36:42,478 --> 00:36:46,022
And I say until you take care of that,
close the fucking book!

500
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,108
Because we're losing.

501
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:52,028
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

502
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:53,863
We're losing our freedom..

503
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,867
so that a bunch of fucking foreigners
can come in and exploit our country.

504
00:36:58,494 --> 00:37:00,870
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

505
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:03,915
This isn't happening in places
we can't do anything about it.

506
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:08,545
It's happening right here! Right in our
neighborhood. Right in that building.

507
00:37:08,712 --> 00:37:12,048
Archie Miller ran that grocery store
since we were kids here.

508
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:15,009
Dave worked there, Mike worked there.

509
00:37:15,177 --> 00:37:18,805
He went under, and now some fucking
Korean owns it, who fired these guys..

510
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:23,268
and is making a killing because
he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.

511
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:26,813
I see this shit going on and I don't see
anybody doing anything about it.

512
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:28,815
And it fucking pisses me off!

513
00:37:31,026 --> 00:37:32,902
So look around you.

514
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:36,156
This isn't our neighborhood.
It's a battlefield.

515
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:39,284
We're on a battlefield tonight.
Make a decision.

516
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:42,412
Are we gonna stand on the sidelines..

517
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,373
quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

518
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,958
Fuck that.

519
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:48,918
Are we gonna ante up
and do something?

520
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:50,587
- Fuck, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

521
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:52,005
You're goddamn right we are.

522
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:05,977
Come here!

523
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:09,939
Don't you know it's against the law
to hire border-jumpers, you nip bastard?

524
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:13,902
Fuck that! Fuck that!

525
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:20,992
Sweetheart. No, you don't need this.
We're not gonna hurt you.

526
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,745
Please! Please, no!

527
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:27,040
You fucking spic!

528
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:32,754
You know what?
I think this bitch is hungry.

529
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:34,964
This bitch stinks.
Get me cleaning products.

530
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:37,050
Smells like fish and chips
and guacamole.

531
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:38,509
Here we go.

532
00:38:38,677 --> 00:38:40,553
Yeah, that's it.

533
00:38:55,444 --> 00:38:56,986
Get the fuck up!

534
00:39:01,158 --> 00:39:02,867
Get down!

535
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:12,585
Have some fucking beans,
you goddamn beaner.

536
00:39:12,753 --> 00:39:13,920
Yeah!

537
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:16,589
- Take my job.
- You donkey bitch!

538
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:22,345
Get some of that in there.

539
00:39:22,513 --> 00:39:25,640
- Throw it on, throw it on.
- Hey, that's a great color on you.

540
00:39:25,808 --> 00:39:27,600
You can get a white woman's job,
bitch.

541
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:30,478
- A little better than this one, huh?
- Yeah.

542
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:33,690
- White.
- You can move up in the world, huh?

543
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:36,776
Asshole!

544
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:42,657
Let's go. We're out of here.
Everybody out. Let's go. Now. Now!

545
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:47,203
All right, let's go! Let's go!

546
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:50,623
- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

547
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,542
Let's go.

548
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:58,840
No green card, no fucking work,
comprendes?

549
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:02,885
- Come on. Come on!
- Go, go, go.

550
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:04,387
We're fucking done! Come on!

551
00:40:30,748 --> 00:40:34,584
Dad was gone.
But things were almost normal again.

552
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:38,254
Derek had a good job.
Mom was starting to live a little.

553
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:42,592
Everyone was feeling so good
that we just didn't see it coming.

554
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,385
Maybe we should have.

555
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:48,097
The irony is that most of the stores
that were destroyed during the riots..

556
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:50,850
- ..were owned by black people.
- That's stupid, though.

557
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:52,477
Why trash your own neighborhood?

558
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:55,438
Well, that's my point.
It's an irrational act.

559
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:59,901
It's like an expression of rage
by people who feel neglected..

560
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:01,611
and turned away by the system.

561
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:04,572
Exactly.
I mean, it's like we had in Watts..

562
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,158
or the riots in Chicago in '68..

563
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:08,785
I don't buy that for a minute.

564
00:41:08,952 --> 00:41:12,622
Calling a riot an irrational expression
of rage, that's such a cop-out.

565
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,249
It's opportunism at its worst.
A bunch of people..

566
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:18,544
grabbing any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store.

567
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:20,713
The fact these people ripped off stores..

568
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:23,549
in their own communities
reflects that these people..

569
00:41:23,717 --> 00:41:25,510
have no respect for the law.

570
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:30,056
And certainly no concept of community
or civic responsibility.

571
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:33,810
Wait a minute. White people commit
crimes against white people too.

572
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:37,313
But they're not offing each other
in record numbers all over America.

573
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:39,315
Look at the statistics, for chrissakes.

574
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:43,903
One in every three black males is in
some phase of the correctional system.

575
00:41:44,071 --> 00:41:48,074
Is that a coincidence or do these people
have a racial commitment to crime?

576
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:50,410
Not only that. They're proud of it.

577
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:53,621
Maybe it says something about prejudice
in the judicial system.

578
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:55,665
If you wanna talk about
criminal statistics..

579
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:59,502
you might wanna take a look at
the social inequalities that produce them.

580
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,671
Yap, yap. You know what?
That's exactly what I hate.

581
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,590
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else..

582
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:08,845
and alleviating the responsibility that
these people have for their own actions.

583
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:10,513
It's like saying:

584
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:13,975
"It's not a riot, it's rage.
It's not crime, it's poverty."

585
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:18,271
It's just nonsense. It's bullshit. It's
exactly what happened in this trial too.

586
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:21,858
Because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops..

587
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:23,568
whether they'd get convicted..

588
00:42:23,735 --> 00:42:26,863
and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

589
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,157
Everybody lost sight
of Rodney King himself.

590
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:32,285
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

591
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:36,539
He's high as a goddamn kite, driving
120 miles an hour down the highway.

592
00:42:36,707 --> 00:42:40,460
He gets pulled over by a bunch of cops,
and he attacks them.

593
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:43,212
He attacked police officers.
Bottom line. And he walked.

594
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,216
And there's some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through..

595
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:49,260
so all we see is them hitting him.

596
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:53,473
Exactly. Powell and Koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs..

597
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,184
and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull.

598
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:58,686
And people are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

599
00:42:58,854 --> 00:43:00,062
Poor guy who attacked 4 cops.

600
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,149
And those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves..

601
00:43:03,317 --> 00:43:06,694
for using absolutely standard,
textbook self-defense procedures.

602
00:43:06,862 --> 00:43:08,821
I don't think the tape showed that at all.

603
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,908
You didn't think so?
And what, you're an authority, Ma?

604
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:14,243
Murray, what do you think?

605
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:19,832
I did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

606
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,336
Who are you to say what's excessive?
I think it was totally appropriate.

607
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:26,422
They're in a better position
to make that judgment call than you are.

608
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,760
In fact, we as society, grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those calls..

609
00:43:30,928 --> 00:43:34,680
because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous.

610
00:43:34,848 --> 00:43:38,601
You know? Unfortunately, very few people,
like, respect that authority.

611
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:41,604
Look who's talking about respect here,
Mr. Junior-KKK.

612
00:43:41,772 --> 00:43:43,731
- What?
- Davina.

613
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:46,776
You wanna go to college, Davina?
You should learn to listen.

614
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:49,946
I didn't say I respected laws.
I acknowledge a cop's authority.

615
00:43:50,113 --> 00:43:53,449
I don't respect laws that let monkeys
like Rodney King on the street.

616
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:55,409
Second, I am not, as you well know..

617
00:43:55,577 --> 00:44:00,289
a member of a low-rent, disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking KKK.

618
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,792
Please. So take your head
out of your ass.

619
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,503
You've gotten off the point.

620
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:10,299
- I had a point. That wasn't the point.
- Do you have one? What is your point?

621
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:12,301
All right, think about this.

622
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:14,637
If Danny had been
walking across the street..

623
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:19,183
- ..and Rodney King had plowed into him..
- Can we just drop this Rodney King thing?

624
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:20,810
Mm-hm.

625
00:44:27,818 --> 00:44:29,610
Who would like some dessert?

626
00:44:31,196 --> 00:44:32,488
We're having a discussion.

627
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:34,907
We're having a nice discussion, right?

628
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,743
If Rodney King had been hopped up
on Chivas Regal and PCP..

629
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:39,996
and killed Danny,
you'd sing a different tune.

630
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:42,707
I didn't see him hit anybody
and neither did you.

631
00:44:42,874 --> 00:44:44,625
He didn't happen to kill anybody.

632
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:47,878
- Thank God.
- Keep it down, okay? Ally's sleeping.

633
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:54,677
If he had, though? Come on, think about it.
If that monkey had run some kid over..

634
00:44:54,845 --> 00:44:57,763
everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter.

635
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,641
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

636
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:03,102
But instead, he just attacked a few cops.

637
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,148
Now all the sudden it's Hands Across
America for this total son of a bitch.

638
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:08,524
I mean, it blows my mind.

639
00:45:08,692 --> 00:45:10,693
We're hung up on this notion
we have some..

640
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:13,446
obligation to help
the struggling black man.

641
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:17,199
Cut him some slack until he can overcome
these historical injustices.

642
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:19,785
It's crap. This stuff you guys
are saying perpetuates it.

643
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:21,329
All this liberal nonsense.

644
00:45:21,496 --> 00:45:24,874
Everyone's looking the other way
while our country rots from inside out.

645
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:28,711
Christ, Lincoln freed the slaves,
what, like, 130 years ago?

646
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:31,464
How long does it take
to get your act together?

647
00:45:31,632 --> 00:45:34,550
Well, Jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years.

648
00:45:34,718 --> 00:45:38,471
Are you saying that it's wrong
to feel sensitive about anti-Semitism?

649
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:42,892
Forget that. I'm with you.
I am with you all the way, baby.

650
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,896
- I'm sick of these liberal hypocrites.
- Here we go again. I love this part.

651
00:45:47,064 --> 00:45:49,982
Well, look at the way that they
scapegoated Chief Gates.

652
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,652
They'd come down that hard
on black Willie Williams?

653
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:56,197
- No way. The video was a setup.
- Jesus Christ. Can I please be excused?

654
00:45:56,573 --> 00:45:58,741
- Yes.
- No, you cannot. Don't interrupt.

655
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:01,744
Excuse me, I was talking.
I listened to you.

656
00:46:01,912 --> 00:46:03,412
The hell do you think you are?

657
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,499
- She's in the middle of a point.
- Who do you think you are?

658
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:07,792
- Sit down!
- No. Fuck you!

659
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:10,211
- Sit down! Shut up!
- Derek, calm down.

660
00:46:10,379 --> 00:46:11,712
- Sit down!
- Derek, calm down.

661
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,256
- Shut up!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

662
00:46:14,424 --> 00:46:16,258
- Sit your ass down! No.
- Fuck you, move!

663
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:18,678
- Sit down, shut up!
- Get out of my way! Move!

664
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:20,054
Goddamn it, Derek, move!

665
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:22,348
Shut your mouth
and give my girlfriend respect.

666
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:24,767
Derek, what are you trying to prove?

667
00:46:24,935 --> 00:46:28,604
Murray, stay out of it! Come here. Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

668
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:32,650
- Derek, let her go! Derek, let her go!
- Come here!

669
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:35,069
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina.

670
00:46:35,237 --> 00:46:38,114
- Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up!
- Derek!

671
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:39,782
Stop!

672
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,992
She can't breathe!

673
00:46:42,536 --> 00:46:44,245
Let her go!

674
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:46,163
Are you gonna apologize?

675
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:48,499
Are you gonna apologize? Are you?

676
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:49,917
You're a fucking asshole.

677
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:52,628
I hate you!

678
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:03,472
What are you doing, Derek?
This is your family.

679
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,143
Right, my family. So you know what?
I don't give two shits about you..

680
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:10,730
anybody else or what you think.
You're not part of it, never will be.

681
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:13,149
- That has nothing to do with it!
- It doesn't?

682
00:47:13,316 --> 00:47:14,900
You don't think I see
what you're doing?

683
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:18,654
You think I'll sit here and smile while
some kike tries to fuck my mother?

684
00:47:19,406 --> 00:47:20,698
It's never gonna happen!

685
00:47:20,866 --> 00:47:23,868
Fucking forget it. Not on my watch.
Not while I'm in this family.

686
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:27,163
I will fucking cut your Shylock nose off
and stick it up your ass..

687
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,665
before I let that happen.
Coming in here..

688
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:34,670
and poisoning my family's dinner with your
Jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!

689
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,177
Fuck you!

690
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:43,137
Yeah, walk out.

691
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:45,431
Asshole-fucking, Cabala-reading
motherfucker!

692
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,141
Get the fuck out of my house!

693
00:47:52,314 --> 00:47:54,315
You see this?
That means "not welcome."

694
00:48:07,162 --> 00:48:08,621
- What did I do?
- You disgust me!

695
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:10,956
You disgust me! Bring him to our table!

696
00:48:11,124 --> 00:48:12,875
Primping your hair and your dress!

697
00:48:13,877 --> 00:48:17,129
- Don't touch me! All tarted up!
- What did I do to you?

698
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:20,758
How could you bring him to Dad's table?
How could you go from Dad to that?

699
00:48:20,926 --> 00:48:22,051
Aren't you ashamed?

700
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:25,513
I'm ashamed that
you came out of my body!

701
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:32,728
Go run to your fucking kike!
Go run to him!

702
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:40,903
It's okay. I'm proud of you, baby.

703
00:48:47,744 --> 00:48:49,411
I'm so sorry, Doris.

704
00:48:49,913 --> 00:48:51,747
I really am.

705
00:48:59,548 --> 00:49:03,092
- He's gone.
- He's just a boy..

706
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,344
without a father.

707
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:09,181
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

708
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:20,901
Goodbye.

709
00:50:06,114 --> 00:50:07,781
Hey. You all right?

710
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:13,412
- Take this, you fucking dick!
- Hey, no. No, no, come here!

711
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,747
- Fuck you!
- Calm down!

712
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:16,123
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

713
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:17,666
Let me go, goddamn it!

714
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:19,835
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

715
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:23,714
I would never hurt you. You know that.

716
00:50:23,882 --> 00:50:25,925
Come on, I screwed up. I lost control.

717
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:27,509
It's not you.

718
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:29,011
I'm sorry.

719
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:31,347
Come on, I'd never hurt you guys.
I'd never hurt you.

720
00:50:31,514 --> 00:50:33,474
You know that. I'd do anything for you.

721
00:50:33,642 --> 00:50:34,850
I don't believe you.

722
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,102
I trust you, Derek.

723
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,155
Hi.

724
00:50:48,323 --> 00:50:50,783
Hi. What are you doing out of bed, huh?

725
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:52,868
- Want a plane ride?
- Yeah.

726
00:50:53,036 --> 00:50:54,870
Going for takeoff.

727
00:50:56,414 --> 00:50:59,249
- Woo-hoo!
- Heh-heh-heh.

728
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:00,501
Oh, no.

729
00:51:00,669 --> 00:51:02,503
No, no! Don't crash!

730
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,214
Gotta go to Mom.

731
00:51:05,382 --> 00:51:07,216
She's a crazy flier.

732
00:51:07,384 --> 00:51:11,053
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

733
00:51:11,846 --> 00:51:13,389
Okay.

734
00:51:19,104 --> 00:51:22,856
- You don't feel too hot.
- No, it's in my chest.

735
00:51:23,024 --> 00:51:25,359
- What are you up to?
- I'm just thinking.

736
00:51:25,944 --> 00:51:27,236
A lot of that going around.

737
00:51:27,404 --> 00:51:30,197
- I don't even know how we got here.
- Mom.

738
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:32,992
Like I let you all down.
I don't know when it happened.

739
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:35,035
Mom, it's okay.

740
00:51:35,203 --> 00:51:36,870
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

741
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:40,666
It's cold in here. No wonder you're sick.

742
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:43,127
Don't get sick from cold,
you get sick from germs.

743
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:46,588
No, you get sick from smoking.

744
00:51:47,632 --> 00:51:50,551
You gotta quit. It's not good for you.

745
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:58,600
What are you looking
at me like that for?

746
00:51:58,768 --> 00:52:01,395
When are you gonna let that
beautiful hair grow back?

747
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:05,232
The day you quit smoking.

748
00:52:08,194 --> 00:52:09,445
Deal.

749
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,531
I better get Ally to bed.

750
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:14,116
- Say good night to Mom?
- Mm-hm.

751
00:52:14,284 --> 00:52:16,577
Then you have to go to bed. Come on.

752
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,413
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

753
00:52:20,457 --> 00:52:21,623
Good night, Mom.

754
00:52:53,823 --> 00:52:57,284
I go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

755
00:52:57,452 --> 00:52:59,328
I try to stop it from happening.

756
00:52:59,496 --> 00:53:01,497
I want you out of this house.

757
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,583
That's fine. I'll be gone in the morning.

758
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,168
He can move in with me.

759
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:09,797
In my mind,
I imagine what would've happened..

760
00:53:09,964 --> 00:53:13,133
if I hadn't gone into that room
and told him.

761
00:53:14,677 --> 00:53:15,761
Danny, get down!

762
00:53:17,263 --> 00:53:20,015
No, Danny!

763
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:22,518
Mommy!

764
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:38,492
Nigger, you just fucked with
the wrong bull.

765
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,702
- Come here!
- Get off!

766
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:44,331
You should've learned your place
on the fucking basketball court!

767
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:47,501
But you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

768
00:53:47,669 --> 00:53:50,045
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

769
00:53:50,213 --> 00:53:51,630
You ever shoot at firemen?

770
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:53,674
You come here, you shoot at my family?

771
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:56,218
I'm gonna teach you a real lesson,
motherfucker.

772
00:53:56,386 --> 00:53:58,387
Put your fucking mouth on the curb.

773
00:53:58,555 --> 00:53:59,555
Come on, man!

774
00:53:59,722 --> 00:54:02,182
Put it on the curb! Right now!

775
00:54:06,062 --> 00:54:08,689
- That's it.
- Derek, no!

776
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:13,193
No!

777
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:14,736
Now say good night.

778
00:54:27,417 --> 00:54:29,042
Fucker.

779
00:54:34,757 --> 00:54:38,135
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

780
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:39,928
Put your hands up!

781
00:54:40,096 --> 00:54:42,097
I said, get your hands up!

782
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:43,765
Now turn around!

783
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:55,861
Put your hands behind your head!

784
00:54:59,282 --> 00:55:01,200
Get down on your knees right now!

785
00:55:58,675 --> 00:56:00,968
It's all right.

786
00:56:01,135 --> 00:56:02,844
It's all right.

787
00:56:04,722 --> 00:56:06,181
Let's go.

788
00:56:07,475 --> 00:56:09,101
Come on.

789
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:19,569
She ain't gonna open the door?

790
00:56:19,737 --> 00:56:22,322
I don't know.
Someone's there looking at us. Hello?

791
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,949
Danny, it's for you.

792
00:56:25,493 --> 00:56:27,035
I'll be right there.

793
00:56:39,674 --> 00:56:42,968
Open the door, Danny!
It's fucking freezing!

794
00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:45,053
Danny, this party's gonna be sick!

795
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:48,056
Come on, Danny!

796
00:57:18,755 --> 00:57:20,922
I'm gonna go get some beers.

797
00:57:33,144 --> 00:57:35,270
Hey, what a party, huh, fat Seth?

798
00:57:35,438 --> 00:57:38,357
I'm not fat, asshole! I'm husky.

799
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:41,193
What the fuck's up, Seth?

800
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:43,445
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

801
00:57:43,613 --> 00:57:44,821
Holy fuck. He's here?

802
00:57:44,989 --> 00:57:46,698
- Yeah, he's here.
- He's fucking here.

803
00:57:46,866 --> 00:57:49,076
- Go pay your respects.
- Fuck you, Seth.

804
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:53,789
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

805
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,501
- Father Vinyard?
- How's it going? I'm Jason, this is Chris.

806
00:57:57,668 --> 00:58:00,670
- We're friends with your brother.
- You are a fucking god, man!

807
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:03,131
- Oh, shit, yeah.
- Derek!

808
00:58:07,804 --> 00:58:09,221
Hey.

809
00:58:20,274 --> 00:58:22,401
- I thought you turned that paper in.
- I did..

810
00:58:22,568 --> 00:58:24,486
and now fucking Murray
turned me in..

811
00:58:24,654 --> 00:58:27,864
and so Sweeney's
making me write another one.

812
00:58:29,325 --> 00:58:32,619
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying, now, does he?

813
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:36,540
He's one of those proud-to-be-nigger
people. I hate those guys.

814
00:58:36,707 --> 00:58:38,417
Now, wait a minute, Danny.

815
00:58:38,584 --> 00:58:40,293
He's not proud.

816
00:58:42,296 --> 00:58:46,133
He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

817
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,470
He's trying to make you feel guilty
about writing about Adolf Hitler. Yeah.

818
00:58:50,638 --> 00:58:54,307
Some nigger, some spic writes about
Martin Luther King..

819
00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:56,476
or fucking Cesar "Commie" Chavez..

820
00:58:56,644 --> 00:58:58,437
- Heh-heh-heh.
- ..gets a pat on the head.

821
00:58:58,896 --> 00:59:00,355
Yeah.

822
00:59:01,023 --> 00:59:03,942
I mean, you can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

823
00:59:05,194 --> 00:59:06,778
Definitely.

824
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:11,825
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

825
00:59:11,993 --> 00:59:13,034
No, listen to me.

826
00:59:15,037 --> 00:59:19,708
I wanna see you, okay? I do. But I
gotta take care of something tonight.

827
00:59:21,794 --> 00:59:24,212
- Okay.
- You understand?

828
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,883
Yeah. I'm here.
When you're ready, I'm here.

829
00:59:31,345 --> 00:59:34,055
- Look, would you do something with me?
- Anything.

830
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:37,058
Leave with me.

831
00:59:37,894 --> 00:59:40,228
- Leave where?
- Leave here. Leave all this.

832
00:59:41,022 --> 00:59:42,522
Just come with me.

833
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:46,234
Why would you wanna leave? They
worship you. You're like a god to them.

834
00:59:46,402 --> 00:59:48,153
If you think we had it good before..

835
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:51,114
- ..wait till you see what it's like now.
- I don't want all that.

836
00:59:51,282 --> 00:59:54,910
I don't want my family involved. Everything
I've done here has fucked it up.

837
00:59:55,077 --> 00:59:58,079
- Do you understand?
- You think what you did was wrong?

838
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:00,999
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

839
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:03,543
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved..

840
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,670
and we all know that.

841
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:07,339
I understand you just got out..

842
01:00:07,507 --> 01:00:10,091
but no one's gonna hurt you.
No one can touch you.

843
01:00:10,259 --> 01:00:11,718
There's a small army out there.

844
01:00:11,886 --> 01:00:14,221
We won't let a bunch of spooks
kick us out of here.

845
01:00:14,388 --> 01:00:17,516
Stacey, you're not listening to me, okay?
I'm not scared.

846
01:00:17,683 --> 01:00:18,850
I don't want it anymore.

847
01:00:19,769 --> 01:00:22,354
I'm done with it. I'm through with this.

848
01:00:23,231 --> 01:00:24,272
It's..

849
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,691
It's bullshit, Stacey.

850
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:30,320
Listen, you don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

851
01:00:30,488 --> 01:00:33,573
If you wanna be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

852
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,784
Come on.

853
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:36,993
You're nuts.

854
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:39,120
You are nuts. No way.

855
01:00:39,705 --> 01:00:42,249
I don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

856
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:46,086
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

857
01:00:46,254 --> 01:00:48,463
I mean, it is like nothing
you have ever seen!

858
01:00:48,631 --> 01:00:49,965
This is a mistake. Forget it.

859
01:00:50,132 --> 01:00:52,968
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

860
01:00:53,135 --> 01:00:55,220
Stacey, just say goodbye.
Just say goodbye.

861
01:00:55,388 --> 01:00:57,430
This isn't you.

862
01:00:57,598 --> 01:01:00,141
- I know you.
- You don't know anything
about me, Stacey.

863
01:01:07,984 --> 01:01:09,943
- Hey. Are you Danny's brother?
- Yeah.

864
01:01:10,111 --> 01:01:11,736
Tell him Lizzy's looking for him.

865
01:01:11,904 --> 01:01:14,114
Lizzy. Thank you.

866
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:20,829
We'll let the niggers, kikes and spics
grab for their piece of the pie.

867
01:01:20,997 --> 01:01:22,289
Can't blame them.

868
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,793
Of course,
they're gonna have to fight to get it.

869
01:01:27,753 --> 01:01:30,755
And if we scare the fuck out of people..

870
01:01:30,923 --> 01:01:34,467
and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

871
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,138
You gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

872
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:42,183
- Ha, ha. Hey, man.
- Well, look who's here.

873
01:01:42,351 --> 01:01:44,269
The return of the soldier.

874
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:49,441
- What are you doing here, Danny?
- Come on, man. I had to check it out.

875
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:52,652
- You knew I was gonna come.
- Let the kid alone, Derek.

876
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:54,696
He knows when to go to bed.

877
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:59,909
- Go wait outside.
- Come on, I'm not doing anything.

878
01:02:00,077 --> 01:02:02,037
There's a little blond sitting out there.

879
01:02:02,204 --> 01:02:05,373
She keeps asking for you.
She's dying. Come on.

880
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:07,751
- Well, I gotta check out.
- Go easy on her.

881
01:02:07,918 --> 01:02:09,878
All right.

882
01:02:13,716 --> 01:02:15,842
Wait for me right outside.

883
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:22,057
Take it easy.

884
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:24,184
Chill out.

885
01:02:25,186 --> 01:02:26,978
You're on safe ground.

886
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:30,398
You don't have to watch your ass
around here.

887
01:02:32,026 --> 01:02:34,194
Come on, sit down. Relax.

888
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:38,073
I'm sorry. The party was a little quick.

889
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,785
But we're just so damned glad
you're back, Derek.

890
01:02:41,952 --> 01:02:45,330
- It's only natural you should feel funny.
- I don't feel funny, Cam.

891
01:02:45,498 --> 01:02:50,085
You know, you made the fat kid nervous.
He thinks the joint messed with your mind.

892
01:02:50,586 --> 01:02:51,586
It did.

893
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:02,389
Glory, glory hallelujah

894
01:03:03,265 --> 01:03:07,560
Glory, glory hallelujah

895
01:03:07,728 --> 01:03:10,939
The white man marches on

896
01:03:11,774 --> 01:03:14,109
Things have changed
since you've been gone, Derek.

897
01:03:14,276 --> 01:03:16,277
You talk about organization?

898
01:03:16,445 --> 01:03:19,114
Wait till you see
what we've done with the Internet.

899
01:03:19,281 --> 01:03:22,951
We've got every gang from Seattle
to San Diego working together now.

900
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,370
They're not competing.
They're consolidated.

901
01:03:25,538 --> 01:03:27,914
Only thing we lack
is a little overall leadership.

902
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:30,834
And that's where you come in.

903
01:03:31,252 --> 01:03:34,212
Because people out there
got a lot of respect for you, Derek.

904
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:38,633
- When you're ready, talk to me about it.
- Well, you can forget about that.

905
01:03:39,385 --> 01:03:40,969
I'm done with it, Cam.

906
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:43,972
Yeah, well, I know you grew out of that..

907
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:47,475
shaved-head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

908
01:03:47,643 --> 01:03:49,310
I like your hair the way it is now.

909
01:03:49,478 --> 01:03:51,896
See, that's what I mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

910
01:03:52,064 --> 01:03:54,816
- No more of this grocery store..
- You're not listening.

911
01:03:54,984 --> 01:03:58,361
I am done with it. All that bullshit
out there and all your bullshit too.

912
01:03:58,738 --> 01:04:00,029
I'm out.

913
01:04:00,197 --> 01:04:03,241
I understand how you feel.
You've just done some hard time..

914
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:05,326
Don't fucking talk to me about hard time.

915
01:04:05,494 --> 01:04:07,620
- You don't know a thing about it.
- I done mine.

916
01:04:07,788 --> 01:04:10,039
You didn't do shit.
I found out about your story.

917
01:04:10,207 --> 01:04:13,835
You did two months, then rolled over
on two kids and let them go down for you.

918
01:04:14,003 --> 01:04:16,004
So don't feed me your fucking lies,
Cameron!

919
01:04:17,673 --> 01:04:19,758
All right, then. This is stupid.

920
01:04:19,925 --> 01:04:21,426
I'm done.

921
01:04:21,594 --> 01:04:23,970
Look, you go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

922
01:04:24,513 --> 01:04:26,848
Get your head on straight,
then I'll talk to you.

923
01:04:27,016 --> 01:04:28,975
But it doesn't matter if I don't, does it?

924
01:04:29,143 --> 01:04:31,436
You got the next crop
all lined up and ready to go..

925
01:04:31,604 --> 01:04:34,689
- ..you fucking chicken hawk!
- Excuse me?

926
01:04:34,857 --> 01:04:37,317
You prey on people, Cam!
You use them!

927
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:40,278
I lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause..

928
01:04:40,446 --> 01:04:42,322
but I am onto you,
you fucking snake.

929
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:45,033
Hey, Derek. Watch it. Be careful.

930
01:04:45,201 --> 01:04:46,451
Remember where you are.

931
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:50,163
This is not a fucking country club
where you can waltz in and out of here..

932
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:51,998
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

933
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:55,251
I came in here to tell you one thing:
I am out. Out!

934
01:04:55,419 --> 01:04:56,544
And Danny is out too.

935
01:04:56,712 --> 01:04:59,172
You come near my family again,
I'll fucking kill you.

936
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:01,674
Well, excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

937
01:05:01,842 --> 01:05:04,010
You can't come barking threats at me.

938
01:05:04,178 --> 01:05:06,721
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

939
01:05:06,889 --> 01:05:10,975
He's not some whining pussy like you.
He needs my help and I'll give it to him.

940
01:05:11,143 --> 01:05:12,852
If you come near Danny again..

941
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,980
I will feed you your fucking heart,
Cameron.

942
01:05:16,148 --> 01:05:17,941
I won't have to.

943
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:20,902
He'll come to me.

944
01:05:22,071 --> 01:05:24,489
I'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

945
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,869
Shit!

946
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:32,956
You're a fucking dead man, Vinyard.

947
01:05:48,305 --> 01:05:50,098
Hey, hey, hey. Where's Cameron?

948
01:05:50,266 --> 01:05:51,432
Where the fuck is he?

949
01:05:52,434 --> 01:05:54,602
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Derek.

950
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,479
Stay away from me, Stacey. Danny!

951
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:58,898
Why don't you share
what you just said to me..

952
01:05:59,066 --> 01:06:01,860
you piece-of-shit, race-trading nigger!

953
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:04,112
- Fucking nigger?
- You monkey-fucking traitor!

954
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,947
Are you a fucking nigger?

955
01:06:06,198 --> 01:06:07,949
Hey, Danny! Come on.

956
01:06:08,117 --> 01:06:10,076
He's a fucking nigger. Nigger. Nigger.

957
01:06:10,244 --> 01:06:11,536
Cam's out cold!

958
01:06:11,704 --> 01:06:13,454
Where the fuck are you going?

959
01:06:14,623 --> 01:06:16,457
He's got a gun!

960
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:19,335
- Yo, yo, back up, back up.
- Seth.

961
01:06:19,503 --> 01:06:21,921
You make me fucking sick!

962
01:06:22,089 --> 01:06:24,215
Seth! Put down the fucking gun!

963
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,466
Go ahead. Shoot.

964
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,304
- Shoot him! Do it, Seth! Shoot him!
- Seth. Holy shit.

965
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:30,597
- Traitor.
- Kick his ass.

966
01:06:30,764 --> 01:06:32,974
- Seth!
- Do it, Seth, do it.

967
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:34,767
- Shoot him.
- Do it! Shoot him!

968
01:06:35,394 --> 01:06:36,686
Oh, God.

969
01:06:36,854 --> 01:06:37,937
Back up. Move.

970
01:06:40,107 --> 01:06:42,317
Back up. Back up. Back the fuck up.

971
01:06:42,484 --> 01:06:44,819
Move. Move.

972
01:06:44,987 --> 01:06:46,112
Easy, Derek. Hey. Hey.

973
01:07:07,885 --> 01:07:10,178
- Danny, easy.
- Fuck you. Who do you think you are?

974
01:07:10,346 --> 01:07:12,180
Danny, Danny. Relax. Relax.

975
01:07:12,348 --> 01:07:15,850
- Who do you think you are?
- Danny. Take it easy, Dan. Take it easy.

976
01:07:16,018 --> 01:07:18,353
I fucking hate you, Der!

977
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,438
All right. Shh, shh. I mean it.

978
01:07:21,106 --> 01:07:23,441
Hey, come on. Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.

979
01:07:23,609 --> 01:07:25,693
- Take it easy.
- What's happened to you, Der?

980
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,863
Take it easy. Take it easy.

981
01:07:29,031 --> 01:07:31,199
What's happened to you, Der?

982
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,126
Come on. Come on.

983
01:07:45,381 --> 01:07:47,215
This is so fucked.

984
01:07:47,383 --> 01:07:48,883
Look. I'm sorry. All right?

985
01:07:49,051 --> 01:07:51,678
You weren't supposed to see that.
I told you not to come.

986
01:07:51,845 --> 01:07:54,055
Fuck you, man.

987
01:07:54,556 --> 01:07:56,015
That was so fucked up.

988
01:07:56,183 --> 01:07:58,101
I know. I know.

989
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:01,104
- God.
- It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

990
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:02,814
That was fucked up.

991
01:08:02,982 --> 01:08:05,400
- That's all there is to it.
- Not what I had planned.

992
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:08,152
It just all went to shit.

993
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,405
It went to shit.

994
01:08:10,572 --> 01:08:12,031
Totally out of control.

995
01:08:13,784 --> 01:08:16,244
What's fucking happening to you, man?

996
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:23,376
Hey. Look at me.

997
01:08:26,755 --> 01:08:28,256
I can't go back to that, Dan.

998
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:30,591
Can't go back to what?

999
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:35,263
To any of it. Those guys, the gang,
that life. I'm done with it.

1000
01:08:39,518 --> 01:08:40,935
What happened to you up there?

1001
01:08:48,902 --> 01:08:52,864
C Block! Back at the chow!
Don't be late today, you piece of shit!

1002
01:08:53,032 --> 01:08:54,741
Let's go! You wanna eat today?

1003
01:08:54,908 --> 01:08:56,909
Get up! Five minutes!

1004
01:08:57,077 --> 01:08:59,245
This is my fucking house! Get up!

1005
01:08:59,413 --> 01:09:01,622
What the fuck's your problem,
you asshole?

1006
01:09:02,124 --> 01:09:03,416
Move!

1007
01:09:03,584 --> 01:09:04,876
Joe, open the fucking gates.

1008
01:09:05,294 --> 01:09:06,836
All right, back up.

1009
01:09:12,134 --> 01:09:14,052
Five minutes. Step forward.

1010
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:16,429
Those beds better be made.

1011
01:09:19,224 --> 01:09:22,477
After two days in that place,
I didn't think I'd make it a week.

1012
01:09:22,644 --> 01:09:24,145
Come on there, motherfuckers.

1013
01:09:24,313 --> 01:09:26,481
You wanna eat today, you piece of shit?

1014
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:29,984
You white-trash piece of shit.
You think you're fucking special?

1015
01:09:30,152 --> 01:09:33,654
Button that top button. Let's go! Move!

1016
01:09:33,822 --> 01:09:36,949
Are you fucking eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole.

1017
01:09:37,117 --> 01:09:39,285
I'll fucking kill you.

1018
01:09:39,745 --> 01:09:42,497
Fucking keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit.

1019
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:47,335
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy,
or I'll fucking skull-fuck you!

1020
01:09:47,503 --> 01:09:49,253
Step forward.

1021
01:09:50,881 --> 01:09:52,673
Turn to the left.

1022
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:56,177
Step forward to chow. Let's go.

1023
01:09:57,346 --> 01:09:58,346
Come on.

1024
01:09:58,514 --> 01:10:00,932
Hey, fish, straight ahead.
Straight ahead, fucker.

1025
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,141
Let's go.

1026
01:10:03,185 --> 01:10:05,269
All the wrong people
knew who I was anyway..

1027
01:10:05,437 --> 01:10:08,731
so I figured I'm just gonna put
up a flag and hope a friend sees it.

1028
01:11:12,087 --> 01:11:13,838
That's the catapult right there.

1029
01:11:33,525 --> 01:11:34,942
- How you doing?
- Good.

1030
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:36,611
Have a seat.

1031
01:11:38,113 --> 01:11:40,990
- Spike. Good to meet you.
- Hey.

1032
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:53,628
Don't fuck with me, all right? Because
I'm the most dangerous man in this prison.

1033
01:11:54,504 --> 01:11:55,713
You know why?

1034
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,507
Because I control the underwear.

1035
01:12:05,474 --> 01:12:08,851
All right, we pick them up over here
and we sort them over there.

1036
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:11,812
I hope you work out, all right?
The last guy they sent me..

1037
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:15,942
didn't wear no drawers,
couldn't read the sizes in the drawers..

1038
01:12:16,109 --> 01:12:17,902
and used to sniff the drawers.

1039
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,154
We got two sizes: Medium and large.
All right?

1040
01:12:20,322 --> 01:12:22,782
All you do is put the mediums
with the mediums..

1041
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,492
and the large with the large.

1042
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,246
It's a boring job, but it's better than
that last shit they had me doing.

1043
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:32,667
I spent two years in the kitchen, ha,
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1044
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:35,628
That, you don't wanna do. All right?

1045
01:12:35,796 --> 01:12:37,838
You should be happy
that you landed this job.

1046
01:12:38,006 --> 01:12:41,342
Ain't no telling what the hell
they'll have you do in the joint.

1047
01:12:42,678 --> 01:12:44,220
By the way, uh..

1048
01:12:45,973 --> 01:12:47,265
what are you in for?

1049
01:12:50,686 --> 01:12:52,520
Probably robbed some old lady, huh?

1050
01:13:03,865 --> 01:13:05,992
Okay, I know your kind, right?

1051
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,369
Badass peckerwood with an attitude.

1052
01:13:10,122 --> 01:13:12,123
Well, let me tell you something, man.

1053
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:14,000
You better watch your ass.

1054
01:13:14,167 --> 01:13:15,918
Because in the joint..

1055
01:13:16,086 --> 01:13:18,045
you the nigger, not me.

1056
01:13:21,967 --> 01:13:25,636
I was a year in. I thought I was cruising.

1057
01:13:25,804 --> 01:13:28,556
Then everything
started getting complicated.

1058
01:13:53,623 --> 01:13:55,249
I'll take care of that, all right?

1059
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:57,043
What the fuck is that?

1060
01:13:58,795 --> 01:14:00,379
What's that all about?

1061
01:14:00,547 --> 01:14:03,758
Oh, that's just politics, man.
Favors, you know.

1062
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:08,012
He's doing favors for that fucking spic?

1063
01:14:09,973 --> 01:14:14,101
Mitch has got a little something extra
on the side with them boys, you know.

1064
01:14:14,811 --> 01:14:16,187
You're kidding, right?

1065
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:18,356
No.

1066
01:14:18,899 --> 01:14:22,401
That's bullshit, man.
Somebody should say something to him.

1067
01:14:22,569 --> 01:14:24,153
What the fuck is he thinking?

1068
01:14:24,321 --> 01:14:26,614
Mitch is the only reason
why you're not a corpse.

1069
01:14:26,782 --> 01:14:29,992
- Remember that.
- You know what? I don't fucking give a shit.

1070
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,287
I can take care of myself.
He shouldn't be doing that.

1071
01:14:33,789 --> 01:14:36,457
I'm getting sick of it.
A lot of hard talk around here..

1072
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,876
and not a lot of follow-through.

1073
01:14:40,879 --> 01:14:43,130
I think you'd better chill out..

1074
01:14:43,298 --> 01:14:47,093
on the preaching bullshit, okay?
We're getting a little tired of that shit.

1075
01:14:48,804 --> 01:14:50,638
Ease up on it.

1076
01:15:20,669 --> 01:15:22,378
What are you doing here, Doris?

1077
01:15:22,546 --> 01:15:24,171
I was in the neighborhood.

1078
01:15:24,339 --> 01:15:26,966
Well, look, I told you I don't want you
all coming here.

1079
01:15:27,134 --> 01:15:30,010
I don't care what you told me, okay?

1080
01:15:30,178 --> 01:15:31,470
I need to talk to you now.

1081
01:15:52,576 --> 01:15:53,617
So how is everyone?

1082
01:15:53,785 --> 01:15:59,206
Davina's great.
She's, uh, getting straight A's almost.

1083
01:15:59,374 --> 01:16:01,625
And, uh, Ally's walking..

1084
01:16:01,793 --> 01:16:03,961
and starting to talk a little.

1085
01:16:08,675 --> 01:16:11,635
- How's Danny?
- Danny?

1086
01:16:12,888 --> 01:16:14,472
Danny.

1087
01:16:15,724 --> 01:16:18,309
He holds you up so high.

1088
01:16:18,477 --> 01:16:20,895
He thinks you're the greatest.

1089
01:16:21,813 --> 01:16:24,857
He's always bragging about you
to Cameron..

1090
01:16:25,567 --> 01:16:26,817
and all his new friends.

1091
01:16:30,655 --> 01:16:32,615
He's starting to remind me of you.

1092
01:16:32,782 --> 01:16:35,451
Jesus, don't sound so worried, all right?

1093
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:37,119
I'm sure he's fine.

1094
01:16:37,287 --> 01:16:41,081
I mean, he's 16 years old, Doris.
He's not gonna be a little angel forever.

1095
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,919
You think because I watched
my first-born fuck up his entire life..

1096
01:16:45,086 --> 01:16:49,089
that I can sit here and see my baby
follow him down the same toilet?

1097
01:16:49,257 --> 01:16:51,884
You know what? I can't fix all
this shit from up here, okay?

1098
01:16:52,052 --> 01:16:53,427
I'm not asking you to.

1099
01:16:53,595 --> 01:16:56,764
It makes me feel bad. I'm trying to get
through this, you make it harder.

1100
01:16:56,932 --> 01:16:59,934
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1101
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,520
You think you're here all alone?

1102
01:17:02,687 --> 01:17:04,522
You think I'm not in here with you?

1103
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:18,577
Fuck, man.

1104
01:17:21,873 --> 01:17:25,626
Every day you go through these sheets
like you gonna get to the end of them.

1105
01:17:26,628 --> 01:17:29,213
Look, nigga, will you chill the fuck out?

1106
01:17:29,381 --> 01:17:32,591
Goddamn! No matter how fast
you get through them, man..

1107
01:17:32,759 --> 01:17:35,261
they'll keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1108
01:17:35,637 --> 01:17:39,139
Throwing them around ain't gonna do
a thing but give you a heart attack.

1109
01:17:39,307 --> 01:17:40,808
Know what? That's cool with me.

1110
01:17:40,976 --> 01:17:43,394
But you're gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack too!

1111
01:17:52,237 --> 01:17:54,655
I know, I know.
I'm just a dumb stupid nigger, right?

1112
01:17:54,823 --> 01:17:56,532
What do I know?

1113
01:17:57,993 --> 01:18:01,203
I know I ain't the one getting mad
at them damn sheets, though.

1114
01:18:01,788 --> 01:18:05,791
As a matter of fact, the only sheets
I get mad at? I'll tell you.

1115
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:10,504
"Boys, this is what we gonna do."

1116
01:18:10,672 --> 01:18:12,339
We gonna hate some niggers.

1117
01:18:12,507 --> 01:18:16,343
We gonna hate some goddamn niggers. That's
all we'll do, is hate niggers all day.

1118
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:18,929
I don't know what a nigger is,
but we'll hate them.

1119
01:18:19,097 --> 01:18:21,015
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now..

1120
01:18:21,182 --> 01:18:25,269
"..working next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy."

1121
01:18:43,496 --> 01:18:45,789
See? That's the ticket.

1122
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,751
Nice and easy.

1123
01:18:49,586 --> 01:18:51,378
Now we can ignore each other in peace.

1124
01:18:55,425 --> 01:18:57,468
I go, "What you doing?"
Know what he tells me?

1125
01:18:57,636 --> 01:19:00,721
He goes, "It's better than the pig
I just tried to fuck."

1126
01:19:03,725 --> 01:19:05,017
Never lets me finish.

1127
01:19:05,185 --> 01:19:07,895
- Why don't you tell a joke?
- Did you fuck him too?

1128
01:19:09,564 --> 01:19:13,859
I get back, she's laying on her back.
She likes the wine bottle thing, right?

1129
01:19:14,903 --> 01:19:16,570
What's up?

1130
01:19:21,993 --> 01:19:24,703
Will you get to the fucking point?
Jesus Christ.

1131
01:19:31,002 --> 01:19:34,755
He was taking it from the Mexicans
and dealing it out to his own people.

1132
01:19:34,923 --> 01:19:38,384
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

1133
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:40,636
Took too damn long.

1134
01:19:48,144 --> 01:19:50,020
Hey. Hey, Vinyard!

1135
01:20:03,827 --> 01:20:05,411
What?

1136
01:20:06,204 --> 01:20:08,497
Come on, man. Don't look at me like that.

1137
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,041
You know what that smells like, right?

1138
01:20:11,209 --> 01:20:14,294
Come on, don't tell me this smell
doesn't remind you of a woman.

1139
01:20:15,797 --> 01:20:17,256
God, I miss that smell, man.

1140
01:20:18,717 --> 01:20:21,719
The job I had on the outside
wasn't much better than this one.

1141
01:20:21,886 --> 01:20:25,472
But at least I gotta go home at night
and lie down next to this sweet smell.

1142
01:20:28,643 --> 01:20:30,436
God, I miss that.

1143
01:20:31,271 --> 01:20:33,105
You got a woman?

1144
01:20:33,273 --> 01:20:34,773
Yeah, you got a woman, man.

1145
01:20:34,941 --> 01:20:37,609
Let me give you some advice. All right?

1146
01:20:37,819 --> 01:20:39,820
She comes to visit you..

1147
01:20:40,613 --> 01:20:44,491
whatever you do, no matter what,
don't let her leave here in a fight.

1148
01:20:44,659 --> 01:20:47,745
Don't let her walk out of here
with a bad attitude. If you do..

1149
01:20:47,912 --> 01:20:52,666
you spend next week wondering if she's
getting her fuck on with somebody else.

1150
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:56,128
She comes to see you it's nothing
but sweet talk through that glass.

1151
01:20:56,296 --> 01:20:58,672
Send her away floating, all right?

1152
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,842
Because it's not like the real world.
Where you can fight..

1153
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:05,596
but it's cool to fight because you
can make up and have make-up sex.

1154
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:08,849
You know what I'm saying? That angry sex.
That sex with an attitude.

1155
01:21:09,017 --> 01:21:12,519
Where you lay on your back and let her
take out all that aggression on you.

1156
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:14,605
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1157
01:21:14,773 --> 01:21:16,774
It's that pow, pow, pow.

1158
01:21:16,941 --> 01:21:19,777
Let her get on top
and she's gonna punish you first, right?

1159
01:21:19,944 --> 01:21:21,445
"You been a bad boy, huh?"

1160
01:21:22,197 --> 01:21:24,323
You been a bad boy
and I'm gonna punish you.

1161
01:21:24,491 --> 01:21:29,620
I'm gonna put it on you.
Don't you ever let me catch you..

1162
01:21:29,788 --> 01:21:31,371
looking at another woman.

1163
01:21:31,873 --> 01:21:34,416
Yeah. I may forgive you if you bring it.

1164
01:21:34,584 --> 01:21:36,919
I think I can. I forgive.

1165
01:21:37,086 --> 01:21:40,589
I forgive. Oh, right there. Right there.
You hitting it. My spot.

1166
01:21:40,757 --> 01:21:44,885
That's it. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Yes. I forgive you.

1167
01:21:45,053 --> 01:21:48,555
I forgive you. I for.. I for..
I forgive you.

1168
01:21:48,723 --> 01:21:50,724
"I love you!"

1169
01:21:54,562 --> 01:21:56,230
Let's keep it moving.

1170
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:11,995
How do you figure the Lakers to ever
be a bigger dynasty than the Celtics?

1171
01:22:12,163 --> 01:22:15,374
- The Lakers are like a flare-up. A fluke.
- Are you crazy?

1172
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:18,502
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are like a dynasty!

1173
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:23,090
Come on, man. The Celtics were, like,
the ugliest team in the history of sports.

1174
01:22:23,258 --> 01:22:25,175
A dynasty of ugly motherfuckers, man.

1175
01:22:25,343 --> 01:22:27,386
Look at Kevin McHale.

1176
01:22:27,554 --> 01:22:30,222
James Worthy?
The guy has a head like a melon.

1177
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:32,933
- No, he had ladies.
- I can't even talk to you.

1178
01:22:33,101 --> 01:22:35,769
- I don't even know what you're saying.
- You are tweaking.

1179
01:22:35,937 --> 01:22:38,021
Boston Celtics.

1180
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:39,523
- How many is that?
- That's enough.

1181
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:41,275
Enough? All right.

1182
01:22:50,577 --> 01:22:52,452
I lost count, man.

1183
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:54,454
- Doesn't matter, man.
- All right.

1184
01:22:54,622 --> 01:22:56,456
Who's counting anyway?

1185
01:23:03,464 --> 01:23:05,424
All right, so I wanna know something.

1186
01:23:06,968 --> 01:23:08,468
What the fuck landed you in here?

1187
01:23:08,636 --> 01:23:10,721
You didn't kill.
Too skinny for a gangbanger.

1188
01:23:10,889 --> 01:23:14,892
That a bitch. Don't judge a book by its cover.
I can throw these things, all right?

1189
01:23:15,059 --> 01:23:18,312
- You know what I'm saying?
- Whatever. Come on. What did you do?

1190
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:22,316
Yo, man, it's none of your business,
all right? It's embarrassing, all right?

1191
01:23:23,985 --> 01:23:26,695
What? Embar..?
Everybody in here is embarrassed.

1192
01:23:26,863 --> 01:23:29,823
You think? Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1193
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:31,825
What did you do?

1194
01:23:33,536 --> 01:23:36,663
Look, man, I stole a TV, all right?

1195
01:23:36,873 --> 01:23:38,665
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing?

1196
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:42,920
I stole a TV from a store that was right
next door to a doughnut shop, all right?

1197
01:23:43,087 --> 01:23:46,006
I run out, the store owner's
running behind me, yelling, bam.

1198
01:23:46,174 --> 01:23:48,592
I run into three cops, all right?

1199
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,844
I told you it was embarrassing
and you laugh.

1200
01:23:51,012 --> 01:23:53,180
Wait a second. Wait a second.

1201
01:23:54,182 --> 01:23:55,807
That doesn't make sense.

1202
01:23:56,893 --> 01:23:59,269
No, you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV.

1203
01:23:59,437 --> 01:24:02,689
- Come on.
- I go in the store, I come out..

1204
01:24:02,857 --> 01:24:06,193
the police officer grabs my arm,
TV falls on his foot and breaks it.

1205
01:24:06,361 --> 01:24:08,528
They said I threw the TV at the officer.

1206
01:24:08,696 --> 01:24:10,656
Assault. Six years.

1207
01:24:10,823 --> 01:24:12,658
Come on. Tell the truth.

1208
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:14,701
You chucked it at him. Or something.

1209
01:24:14,869 --> 01:24:17,829
Like I said, I came out of the store..

1210
01:24:17,997 --> 01:24:21,541
he grabbed my arm, it fell on his foot.

1211
01:24:26,464 --> 01:24:30,342
What you got for me, baby?
What you got for me? What you got for me?

1212
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:33,762
There you go, baby. Yeah, baby.

1213
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:35,889
That's what I'm talking about!

1214
01:24:40,186 --> 01:24:41,770
Put some D on him, now.

1215
01:25:13,845 --> 01:25:14,928
Fuck you.

1216
01:25:15,096 --> 01:25:16,930
Get a towel! Hold him. Hold him.

1217
01:25:24,272 --> 01:25:26,940
- You wanna be a nigger, sweet boy?
- Fuck you!

1218
01:25:27,108 --> 01:25:29,443
We're gonna treat you like one.

1219
01:25:30,695 --> 01:25:32,279
Come on.

1220
01:25:46,878 --> 01:25:48,128
Fuck you.

1221
01:25:53,634 --> 01:25:55,218
- That was real sweet.
- Fuck you!

1222
01:26:28,795 --> 01:26:30,837
How is he?

1223
01:26:31,005 --> 01:26:32,964
Well, he took six stitches.

1224
01:26:41,349 --> 01:26:42,557
Hey, man.

1225
01:27:14,799 --> 01:27:17,384
Oh, man, what the hell
are you doing here, anyway?

1226
01:27:17,552 --> 01:27:21,221
Well, I came to talk about Danny,
but we don't have to do that right now.

1227
01:27:21,389 --> 01:27:22,639
I brought you some books.

1228
01:27:25,309 --> 01:27:28,228
Well, what about him? You know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1229
01:27:28,855 --> 01:27:30,897
He's headed right where you are.

1230
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,986
Oh, man, you know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me, man.

1231
01:27:36,154 --> 01:27:38,280
Danny's not my responsibility.
You know?

1232
01:27:38,447 --> 01:27:41,950
What do you expect me to do? It doesn't
help. Am I supposed to feel guilty?

1233
01:27:42,118 --> 01:27:46,413
I don't want you to do anything. I need
to know the truth about how you feel.

1234
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:49,791
Well, what?
You think I want him in here? I mean..

1235
01:27:49,959 --> 01:27:53,211
I don't know. I don't know what I feel.
I'm all..

1236
01:27:55,214 --> 01:27:56,756
I feel a little inside out.

1237
01:27:57,425 --> 01:28:00,594
Um, you know, I don't know.
There's some things..

1238
01:28:01,262 --> 01:28:02,929
that don't fit.

1239
01:28:03,097 --> 01:28:04,890
Well, that happens.

1240
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:08,768
Look, you are too damn smart
to be floating around here..

1241
01:28:08,936 --> 01:28:11,521
pretending you don't see
the holes in this bullshit.

1242
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:14,691
Listen, I said I was confused.
I didn't say I didn't believe in it.

1243
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:17,235
All right.
That's why you have to stay open.

1244
01:28:17,987 --> 01:28:19,946
Right now,
your anger is consuming you.

1245
01:28:20,114 --> 01:28:23,116
Your anger is shutting down the brain
God gave you.

1246
01:28:23,284 --> 01:28:26,786
You've been talking about what's going
on in me since I was in high school.

1247
01:28:26,954 --> 01:28:29,956
How the fuck do you know so much
about what's going on inside me?

1248
01:28:30,124 --> 01:28:32,250
No, I know about me.

1249
01:28:32,418 --> 01:28:36,630
I know about this place.
I know about the place you are in.

1250
01:28:37,173 --> 01:28:39,299
What do you know
about the place I'm in?

1251
01:28:39,467 --> 01:28:41,343
There was a moment..

1252
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:44,346
when I used to blame
everything and everyone..

1253
01:28:44,513 --> 01:28:48,600
for all the pain and suffering
and vile things that happened to me..

1254
01:28:48,768 --> 01:28:51,144
that I saw happen to my people.

1255
01:28:52,104 --> 01:28:54,022
I used to blame everybody.
Blame white people.

1256
01:28:54,190 --> 01:28:56,775
Blame society. Blame God.

1257
01:28:57,193 --> 01:29:00,820
I didn't get no answers, because
I was asking the wrong questions.

1258
01:29:00,988 --> 01:29:03,657
- You have to ask the right questions.
- Like what?

1259
01:29:06,452 --> 01:29:08,995
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1260
01:29:20,007 --> 01:29:21,341
No.

1261
01:29:29,558 --> 01:29:30,934
You gotta help me now.

1262
01:29:34,105 --> 01:29:35,855
Just help me.

1263
01:29:37,358 --> 01:29:39,359
Get me out of here, you know?

1264
01:29:42,363 --> 01:29:45,115
I'm up in four months for review.

1265
01:29:46,701 --> 01:29:48,451
Put in a word for me.

1266
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:51,037
I already have.
So you're out there, then what?

1267
01:29:51,205 --> 01:29:53,873
I don't wanna fuck up
my family anymore.

1268
01:29:54,041 --> 01:29:56,209
I'll go as far away as I can get.

1269
01:29:56,877 --> 01:29:58,003
That's not good enough.

1270
01:29:59,463 --> 01:30:04,009
You want my help, you gotta do better
than that. My help is not unconditional.

1271
01:30:05,011 --> 01:30:07,971
But running just ain't good enough.

1272
01:30:40,921 --> 01:30:42,213
Fuck him.

1273
01:30:42,381 --> 01:30:45,050
Fuck him. Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1274
01:30:46,844 --> 01:30:48,595
Yo, what's up, D?

1275
01:30:48,763 --> 01:30:51,806
Yo, what's all that bullshit you pulled
in the mess hall, man?

1276
01:30:52,433 --> 01:30:55,185
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you fucking crazy?

1277
01:30:56,395 --> 01:30:58,521
D! Look at me, man!

1278
01:30:58,689 --> 01:31:00,106
You can't make it on your own.

1279
01:31:00,274 --> 01:31:04,235
I'm not afraid of those fucking pussies.
There was six of them, they jumped me.

1280
01:31:04,403 --> 01:31:06,863
That won't happen again.
I hope they fucking try.

1281
01:31:07,031 --> 01:31:09,574
Look, I'm not talking about
your peckerwood friends!

1282
01:31:09,742 --> 01:31:11,951
They were protecting your stupid ass!

1283
01:31:12,119 --> 01:31:13,953
You dissed them in public.

1284
01:31:14,121 --> 01:31:16,164
Now you're on your fucking own!

1285
01:31:16,332 --> 01:31:18,541
Yo, man, I'm talking about the brothers.

1286
01:31:18,709 --> 01:31:22,379
They're gonna fuck you, toss your salad,
then smoke your motherfucking ass!

1287
01:31:22,546 --> 01:31:26,466
Tell me something I don't already know.
You think I haven't thought about that?

1288
01:31:26,634 --> 01:31:29,761
They're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come. Nothing I can do.

1289
01:31:32,139 --> 01:31:34,182
What can I do, man?

1290
01:31:38,396 --> 01:31:40,647
So I was right back where I started.

1291
01:31:40,815 --> 01:31:42,565
Every day, I was sure it was my day.

1292
01:31:44,443 --> 01:31:46,861
Every time I stepped out of my cell.

1293
01:31:47,029 --> 01:31:49,489
Every time I got in that shower.

1294
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:56,454
I figured it was only a matter of time
before they made a move.

1295
01:31:58,165 --> 01:32:00,542
I just hoped that it'd be quick.

1296
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:34,242
But it never came.

1297
01:32:35,661 --> 01:32:38,788
I couldn't figure it out.
I knew some of them were itching for it.

1298
01:32:38,956 --> 01:32:41,374
But after a while
I just put my head down..

1299
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:44,878
read the stuff that Sweeney sent me,
and I kept to myself.

1300
01:32:47,548 --> 01:32:50,175
The last 6 months in that place
I was like a ghost.

1301
01:33:04,732 --> 01:33:06,483
What's up, man? You getting out?

1302
01:33:09,778 --> 01:33:12,572
What the fuck you waiting on?
Get the fuck on out of here.

1303
01:33:15,034 --> 01:33:18,369
- Yeah, you know, I got this funny feeling.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

1304
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,667
I'm thinking maybe the only reason I'm
getting out of here in one piece is you.

1305
01:33:24,835 --> 01:33:26,878
Come on, man.
Get the fuck out of here, man!

1306
01:33:27,046 --> 01:33:30,507
You think I'm gonna put my neck on
the line for a crazy-ass peckerwood?

1307
01:33:31,425 --> 01:33:34,594
Yeah. Right. Stupid.

1308
01:33:40,476 --> 01:33:42,268
That's what I thought.

1309
01:33:46,482 --> 01:33:48,441
I owe you, man.

1310
01:33:49,276 --> 01:33:51,611
Man, you don't owe me shit, all right?

1311
01:33:53,948 --> 01:33:55,823
Yes, I do.

1312
01:34:05,751 --> 01:34:07,085
You'll be out in no time.

1313
01:34:07,253 --> 01:34:09,379
Come on, man.
It's a piece of cake. All right?

1314
01:34:11,674 --> 01:34:14,592
You just take it easy on the brothers,
all right? The brothers!

1315
01:34:25,187 --> 01:34:27,146
God, man.

1316
01:34:29,024 --> 01:34:31,317
I'm sorry, Der.

1317
01:34:31,652 --> 01:34:34,112
Sorry that happened to you.

1318
01:34:35,155 --> 01:34:38,283
No, I'm not. I'm lucky.

1319
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:40,034
I feel lucky because..

1320
01:34:40,202 --> 01:34:42,120
it's wrong, Dan.

1321
01:34:43,872 --> 01:34:47,834
It's wrong and it was eating me up.
It was gonna kill me.

1322
01:34:48,002 --> 01:34:50,712
And I kept asking myself all the time..

1323
01:34:50,879 --> 01:34:53,840
how did I buy into this shit,
you know?

1324
01:34:55,509 --> 01:34:57,760
And it's just because I was pissed off.

1325
01:34:58,262 --> 01:35:02,056
And nothing I ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1326
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,852
I mean, I killed two guys, Danny.
I killed them.

1327
01:35:08,188 --> 01:35:10,607
And that didn't make me
feel any different.

1328
01:35:11,525 --> 01:35:14,986
It just got me more lost. And I'm
tired of feeling pissed off, Danny.

1329
01:35:15,863 --> 01:35:17,530
I'm just tired of it.

1330
01:35:18,866 --> 01:35:21,034
And I'm not telling you what to do.

1331
01:35:21,869 --> 01:35:23,536
I'm really not.

1332
01:35:24,371 --> 01:35:26,539
But I need you to understand.

1333
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:30,877
Because I love you
and you're my best friend.

1334
01:35:33,672 --> 01:35:35,465
Do you understand?

1335
01:35:35,633 --> 01:35:37,592
Yeah, I understand.

1336
01:35:41,347 --> 01:35:42,722
All right.

1337
01:35:45,059 --> 01:35:46,225
Whoo!

1338
01:35:46,393 --> 01:35:48,102
Jesus.

1339
01:36:02,993 --> 01:36:05,370
- Hey.
- Hi.

1340
01:36:05,537 --> 01:36:07,830
- Everything okay?
- No, everything's great.

1341
01:36:07,998 --> 01:36:10,583
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1342
01:36:10,751 --> 01:36:14,045
- No, thank you. Yeah. This is good. I'm fine.
- You sure?

1343
01:36:14,838 --> 01:36:16,381
Thank you, though.

1344
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,841
All right. Come on, let's go.

1345
01:36:39,738 --> 01:36:41,280
Good night.

1346
01:37:48,348 --> 01:37:50,099
I'm gonna take a shower, all right?

1347
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:28,221
It's hard to look back and see
the truth about people you love.

1348
01:38:28,388 --> 01:38:32,558
I think if you asked Derek why it all went
the way it did, and where it all started..

1349
01:38:32,726 --> 01:38:35,394
he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

1350
01:38:36,522 --> 01:38:38,856
But the truth is, it started earlier.

1351
01:38:39,274 --> 01:38:42,151
All right. Are we all meeting together
for the game tonight?

1352
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:43,653
Yes, definitely.

1353
01:38:43,821 --> 01:38:46,447
Ben's Burgers, 7:00,
then we go watch the big guy play.

1354
01:38:46,615 --> 01:38:48,825
Okay. Yeah.

1355
01:38:48,992 --> 01:38:52,411
- Psyching up for the game?
- Yeah, I'm always ready for that.

1356
01:38:52,579 --> 01:38:56,582
I got an English exam third period.
I'm having a heart attack. I'm not ready.

1357
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:59,377
What's the matter,
afraid you're gonna get a B?

1358
01:38:59,545 --> 01:39:01,379
Might do you good. B minus.

1359
01:39:02,506 --> 01:39:04,257
Don't laugh. This guy is different.

1360
01:39:04,424 --> 01:39:08,886
Dr. Sweeney? This guy's unbelievable.
I've never had a teacher like this.

1361
01:39:09,054 --> 01:39:11,848
He's got two Ph.D.s. I don't know
what he's doing at our school.

1362
01:39:12,015 --> 01:39:15,101
- He's not like other teachers.
- What's he got you reading?

1363
01:39:16,395 --> 01:39:18,771
We got this essay exam on this book,
Native Son.

1364
01:39:18,939 --> 01:39:21,440
- All on this one book.
- Native Son. I don't know that.

1365
01:39:21,608 --> 01:39:22,859
That's a big surprise.

1366
01:39:24,444 --> 01:39:26,696
What? I read.

1367
01:39:26,864 --> 01:39:29,949
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy at school.

1368
01:39:31,869 --> 01:39:33,619
Well, they don't.

1369
01:39:33,787 --> 01:39:36,163
So, what is it? What is this Native Son?
What is it?

1370
01:39:36,331 --> 01:39:38,457
It's this book about this black guy.

1371
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:41,460
We're doing this
whole black literature unit.

1372
01:39:42,254 --> 01:39:43,921
What is it, Black History Month?

1373
01:39:44,298 --> 01:39:45,506
No, it's just like..

1374
01:39:45,674 --> 01:39:48,301
This guy Sweeney, you know,
it's part of the course now.

1375
01:39:51,597 --> 01:39:53,264
Yeah.

1376
01:39:55,309 --> 01:39:56,559
What?

1377
01:39:57,519 --> 01:39:59,395
Nothing. It's just, you know.

1378
01:39:59,563 --> 01:40:01,439
It's everywhere I look now.

1379
01:40:02,524 --> 01:40:03,816
What?

1380
01:40:05,235 --> 01:40:07,778
This affirmative blaction.

1381
01:40:08,822 --> 01:40:12,742
Honey, a few new books doesn't
qualify as affirmative black action.

1382
01:40:13,994 --> 01:40:15,661
Read the book, ace the guy's test.

1383
01:40:15,829 --> 01:40:18,164
Just don't swallow everything
he feeds you whole.

1384
01:40:18,332 --> 01:40:20,833
- Just because you see it on the news.
- But like what?

1385
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:24,337
All this stuff about making everything equal.
It's not that simple.

1386
01:40:24,504 --> 01:40:26,213
Now you got this book, Native Son.

1387
01:40:26,381 --> 01:40:28,507
What happened to the other books
in the course?

1388
01:40:28,675 --> 01:40:32,720
They're not any good anymore because
Mr. Two-Ph.D. S says they aren't?

1389
01:40:32,888 --> 01:40:36,849
Are you gonna trade in great books
for black books? Does that make sense?

1390
01:40:38,226 --> 01:40:40,102
You gotta question these things, Derek.

1391
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:42,271
You gotta look at the whole picture.

1392
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:45,524
We're talking about books here.
But I'm also talking about my job.

1393
01:40:45,943 --> 01:40:49,236
I got two black guys on my squad now
who got their job..

1394
01:40:49,404 --> 01:40:53,032
over a couple of white guys
who actually scored higher on the test.

1395
01:40:54,326 --> 01:40:58,037
That make sense? Huh?
Yeah, sure, everything's equal now..

1396
01:40:58,205 --> 01:41:02,458
but I got two guys watching my back,
responsible for my life..

1397
01:41:02,626 --> 01:41:06,295
who aren't as good as two others.
They got the job because they were black.

1398
01:41:06,463 --> 01:41:09,256
- Not because they were the best.
- That sucks.

1399
01:41:09,424 --> 01:41:11,342
Yeah. Is that what America is about?

1400
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:13,636
No. America's about
"best man for the job."

1401
01:41:13,804 --> 01:41:15,888
You do your best, you get the job.

1402
01:41:16,056 --> 01:41:19,350
You know, this affirmative action crap..

1403
01:41:19,518 --> 01:41:21,769
I don't know what that's about.
There's some..

1404
01:41:21,937 --> 01:41:24,563
hidden agenda or something going on.

1405
01:41:24,731 --> 01:41:26,816
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I do.

1406
01:41:26,984 --> 01:41:29,402
I don't know,
I didn't think about it like that.

1407
01:41:29,569 --> 01:41:31,946
- Well..
- This guy, though..

1408
01:41:32,114 --> 01:41:35,032
I don't know. Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on, like, so strong..

1409
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,410
it's kind of hard not to listen to him.

1410
01:41:37,577 --> 01:41:39,537
Maybe some of what he says is kind of..

1411
01:41:39,705 --> 01:41:41,330
It's bullshit.

1412
01:41:41,498 --> 01:41:43,749
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1413
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:45,501
No, no.

1414
01:41:45,669 --> 01:41:48,170
It's nigger bullshit.

1415
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,591
- You see that, don't you?
- Yeah.

1416
01:41:53,427 --> 01:41:57,430
- You gotta watch out for that.
- Yeah, I get what you're saying. I will.

1417
01:41:59,307 --> 01:42:00,766
Good boy.

1418
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:05,229
- I'm proud of you.
- Don't worry about it. I got it.

1419
01:44:08,979 --> 01:44:10,396
It's 5:40 a. M..

1420
01:44:10,564 --> 01:44:14,984
and in about one minute,
I'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1421
01:44:15,235 --> 01:44:17,528
I don't know if I've ever done that.

1422
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:22,074
Anyway, we're gonna try
to pick things up and start over.

1423
01:44:22,242 --> 01:44:25,202
It won't be easy,
but we're all together again.

1424
01:44:26,079 --> 01:44:28,164
And I feel good.

1425
01:44:29,374 --> 01:44:31,709
I'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted.

1426
01:44:31,877 --> 01:44:35,671
If I hit the social significance,
or whatever you're looking for.

1427
01:44:36,089 --> 01:44:40,134
But, for what it's worth, thanks a lot.

1428
01:44:54,441 --> 01:44:56,859
Wow. You look great.

1429
01:44:57,027 --> 01:44:58,861
Look at you.

1430
01:44:59,696 --> 01:45:02,615
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

1431
01:45:03,116 --> 01:45:04,533
Is she cute?

1432
01:45:04,701 --> 01:45:07,286
She is a fat guy named Hector.

1433
01:45:07,454 --> 01:45:09,413
So I'm out of luck.

1434
01:45:12,417 --> 01:45:15,544
I just gotta check in, then I'll see
about getting my old job back.

1435
01:45:16,213 --> 01:45:17,463
Great.

1436
01:45:17,631 --> 01:45:19,632
- Good morning.
- Yes, my love.

1437
01:45:19,799 --> 01:45:23,677
Davina, can you..?
Your sister's gonna help you, honey.

1438
01:45:23,845 --> 01:45:25,763
- You look great. Knock them dead.
- Okay.

1439
01:45:25,931 --> 01:45:27,223
Thanks.

1440
01:45:27,474 --> 01:45:31,769
- What would you like to wear?
- I wanna wear my blue dress today.

1441
01:45:31,937 --> 01:45:35,064
- You do look good.
- Yeah? I feel silly.

1442
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,316
- You look good.
- Yeah?

1443
01:45:39,736 --> 01:45:41,237
You feel good?

1444
01:45:43,990 --> 01:45:47,076
Yeah. Yeah. I feel, you know..

1445
01:45:47,244 --> 01:45:49,328
a little..

1446
01:45:49,496 --> 01:45:51,330
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1447
01:45:53,166 --> 01:45:56,293
Listen, I don't know..

1448
01:45:56,461 --> 01:45:59,296
I don't know if it's okay that I'm here.

1449
01:46:03,051 --> 01:46:05,302
I wanna be here.

1450
01:46:23,196 --> 01:46:24,655
- I'm gonna get a paper.
- Cool.

1451
01:46:42,299 --> 01:46:44,925
- What do you want?
- A maple bar and a large milk.

1452
01:46:45,093 --> 01:46:46,760
All right, I got it.

1453
01:46:51,766 --> 01:46:55,436
Let me get a coffee, a maple bar
and a large milk to go.

1454
01:46:55,603 --> 01:46:57,062
Right away.

1455
01:47:05,196 --> 01:47:07,031
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey.

1456
01:47:08,033 --> 01:47:09,241
Derek.

1457
01:47:09,409 --> 01:47:11,910
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

1458
01:47:12,078 --> 01:47:15,956
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the ICU at St. John's.

1459
01:47:16,124 --> 01:47:18,375
- They were jumped last night.
- How bad?

1460
01:47:18,543 --> 01:47:20,794
Well, it looks like they're gonna live.

1461
01:47:20,962 --> 01:47:24,048
- Then they got lucky.
- Somebody's gotta lose, though.

1462
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:28,969
Aw, what?

1463
01:47:29,137 --> 01:47:32,264
We were kind of hoping that maybe
you'd talk to your old crew.

1464
01:47:32,432 --> 01:47:34,600
- Come on. No way.
- This is not a good thing.

1465
01:47:34,768 --> 01:47:36,935
If there's anybody they'll listen to,
it's you.

1466
01:47:37,103 --> 01:47:39,355
No. No, I hate to tell you, but I'm out.

1467
01:47:39,522 --> 01:47:41,565
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1468
01:47:41,733 --> 01:47:43,609
We're asking for your help here, Derek.

1469
01:47:43,777 --> 01:47:46,236
- Did you tell him I was gonna do this?
- Derek.

1470
01:47:52,452 --> 01:47:54,119
This has got nothing to do with me.

1471
01:47:54,287 --> 01:47:57,081
Yes, it does.
It has everything to do with you.

1472
01:47:57,248 --> 01:47:59,958
What are you doing to me?
You know, I'm doing my best.

1473
01:48:00,126 --> 01:48:02,628
I'm going like this to keep
my family in the clear.

1474
01:48:02,796 --> 01:48:05,255
- Don't ask me to fix this.
- I'm not asking that.

1475
01:48:05,423 --> 01:48:09,343
- It was there before me.
- You helped create it. Wanna take a break?

1476
01:48:09,511 --> 01:48:11,762
You take a break, you'll find no peace.

1477
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:14,306
The way to find peace is to stick.

1478
01:48:15,141 --> 01:48:17,476
It's not gonna make
a fucking bit of difference.

1479
01:48:17,644 --> 01:48:19,186
It might.

1480
01:48:20,605 --> 01:48:22,981
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you really know?

1481
01:48:23,149 --> 01:48:26,235
Yes. I'm asking you to do
whatever is in your power to do.

1482
01:48:29,322 --> 01:48:30,656
Man.

1483
01:48:32,617 --> 01:48:34,118
Fuck.

1484
01:48:39,082 --> 01:48:40,666
All right.

1485
01:48:42,836 --> 01:48:44,795
You're gonna get me shot by white boys.

1486
01:48:44,963 --> 01:48:47,673
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, well..

1487
01:48:47,841 --> 01:48:51,218
we're all gonna have a laugh at that,
let me tell you.

1488
01:48:51,386 --> 01:48:54,638
I'm gonna take him to school.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1489
01:48:54,806 --> 01:48:56,181
Come on.

1490
01:48:56,349 --> 01:48:59,643
Hey, you. You got
something good for me this morning?

1491
01:48:59,811 --> 01:49:03,355
- I'll give it to you, Dr. Sweeney. All right?
- Yeah, okay.

1492
01:49:07,694 --> 01:49:09,194
What's going on?

1493
01:49:14,701 --> 01:49:16,160
Come on.

1494
01:49:32,051 --> 01:49:35,053
This is so bad for Seth, man.

1495
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:38,390
- I wonder how bad they got fucked up.
- I don't know.

1496
01:49:38,558 --> 01:49:41,560
I'm glad they're not dead,
but other than that, I don't care.

1497
01:49:42,395 --> 01:49:43,687
Should we visit them?

1498
01:49:43,855 --> 01:49:45,981
Visit them? No. No, definitely not.

1499
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:48,484
Definitely not. Just stay out of it.

1500
01:49:48,651 --> 01:49:50,444
Listen, too..

1501
01:49:50,612 --> 01:49:54,656
I saw a car cruising by the house last night
when I pulled out of there with Seth.

1502
01:49:54,824 --> 01:49:57,618
If you get home before me,
look around the street, all right?

1503
01:49:57,785 --> 01:49:59,745
Make sure there's nothing going on.

1504
01:50:01,164 --> 01:50:03,040
Oh, man. This is bad.

1505
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:08,337
- They're after you, man.
- It'll cool off.

1506
01:50:08,505 --> 01:50:10,172
If I made it through Chino..

1507
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:13,926
this should be a piece of cake, right?

1508
01:50:14,093 --> 01:50:17,262
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1509
01:50:18,681 --> 01:50:20,098
Okay.

1510
01:50:20,683 --> 01:50:22,142
What are you gonna do?

1511
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:24,061
I don't know. I'll work it out. Hey.

1512
01:50:24,229 --> 01:50:26,355
Keep your head up.
Things are gonna be fine.

1513
01:50:26,523 --> 01:50:28,357
It's gonna be fine.

1514
01:50:28,525 --> 01:50:30,234
Go turn that paper in.

1515
01:50:32,445 --> 01:50:35,113
- Okay. All right, see you.
- Hey, hey, Dan.

1516
01:50:42,956 --> 01:50:44,581
I'll see you at home.

1517
01:50:46,501 --> 01:50:48,085
All right?

1518
01:50:48,461 --> 01:50:49,711
Yeah, I'll see you.

1519
01:50:49,879 --> 01:50:52,047
- Hey, good luck, all right?
- Yeah.

1520
01:50:52,423 --> 01:50:53,966
See you later.

1521
01:50:59,889 --> 01:51:01,848
- We're gonna be late.
- We'd better go.

1522
01:51:02,016 --> 01:51:04,601
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

1523
01:51:27,667 --> 01:51:30,586
- Fine.
- All right. I'll catch up with you, all right?

1524
01:51:30,837 --> 01:51:32,379
See you later.

1525
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,378
- Derek, no!
- Get out of my way!

1526
01:52:54,545 --> 01:52:56,630
- All right. All right.
- Get out of my way!

1527
01:52:56,798 --> 01:52:58,215
Let him go!

1528
01:52:59,884 --> 01:53:03,929
Oh, no. No! No! No!

1529
01:53:04,263 --> 01:53:06,431
Oh, Jesus.

1530
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:10,936
No.

1531
01:53:11,104 --> 01:53:15,273
Oh, no, no. No.

1532
01:53:29,831 --> 01:53:31,540
Oh, Jesus.

1533
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:33,875
God, what did I do?

1534
01:53:47,265 --> 01:53:51,727
Oh, God.

1535
01:54:02,655 --> 01:54:05,282
So I guess this is where
I tell you what I learned.

1536
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:07,826
My conclusion, right?

1537
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:10,746
Well, my conclusion is..

1538
01:54:10,913 --> 01:54:12,914
hate is baggage.

1539
01:54:13,166 --> 01:54:16,460
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1540
01:54:17,003 --> 01:54:18,879
It's just not worth it.

1541
01:54:21,674 --> 01:54:24,801
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1542
01:54:25,303 --> 01:54:27,345
He says someone else
has already said it best..

1543
01:54:27,513 --> 01:54:32,017
so if you can't top it,
steal from them and go out strong.

1544
01:54:32,185 --> 01:54:34,853
So I picked a guy I thought you'd like:

1545
01:54:36,439 --> 01:54:39,816
"We are not enemies, but friends."

1546
01:54:39,984 --> 01:54:42,402
We must not be enemies.

1547
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:44,780
Though passion may have strained..

1548
01:54:44,947 --> 01:54:48,200
it must not break
our bonds of affection.

1549
01:54:48,367 --> 01:54:53,205
The mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched..

1550
01:54:53,372 --> 01:54:58,001
"..as surely they will be,
by the better angels of our nature."

1551
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:14,400
