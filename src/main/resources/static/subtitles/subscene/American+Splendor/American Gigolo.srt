1
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,632
Julian.
You came all the way out here?

2
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,597
I had to leave somebody at the beach.

3
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,638
- It's been weeks.
- Hi.

4
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,153
Hello, girls.

5
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,913
You didn't fly to Rio
for the weekend?

6
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,029
Don't mind them.
They're just jealous.

7
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,998
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

8
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,548
Yeah, I got the message. Number?

9
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,393
Tonight. It's a woman
from Charlottesville.

10
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,790
She's flying in for negotiation
on her husband's estate.

11
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,919
- First time?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,039
She's meeting lawyers in the morning.
They want a chauffeur.

13
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,230
- Is she into drugs?
- No, no drugs.

14
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,632
1,000, right?

15
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,356
600 for me.

16
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,228
- Don't start this again.
- You want 50/50, get Mike,

17
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,756
or one of those drop-outs
you like so much.

18
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,150
There's no percentage in it
if I don't get 50/50.

19
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,708
You already cut me out of repeaters.

20
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,189
It's only fair. Only fair.

21
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,955
It ain't fair, Julie,
but I don't have any choice.

22
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,828
You got a lot of choice. You can
keep dealing retarded faggots...

23
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,876
Look who's talking!

24
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,190
All right... 50/50.

25
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,674
Who'd you drop off up the beach?

26
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,356
- Wouldn't you like to know.
- Why do you do this to me?

27
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,910
You know anybody else
who gets in the LA Country Club?

28
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,788
And that's not the Hillcrest
or the Riverside or the Riviera.

29
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,838
I gotta run.
Leave the info on the service.

30
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,560
You don't want to take some sun?

31
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,712
I'm sure the girls
would like some company.

32
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,430
No, thanks. No way. See you later.

33
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,476
How's the Swedish coming?

34
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,078
OK.

35
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,038
Do you want me to help you?

36
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,510
Listen to the recording
and repeat what you hear.

37
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,195
Listen and then repeat.

38
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,033
I am not interested in that.

39
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,954
I am not interested in that.

40
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,119
How much farther have we to go?

41
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,119
How much farther have we to go?

42
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,200
Is this your first visit?

43
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,310
Yeah?

44
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,516
OK, let him through.

45
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,556
Hey, Leon, what's up?

46
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,189
Julie, I hate to bug you,
but you gotta help me.

47
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,511
I had this Palm Springs gig
set up for Joey

48
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,352
and he ain't nowhere around.

49
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,434
I can't do it. I'm getting a haircut
I got something on this afternoon.

50
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,556
Baby, this is a two-hour gig.

51
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,437
Plus the drive.

52
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,798
5C, straight in-and-out job.
Nothing fancy. Do me a favour.

53
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,350
I don't know. Maybe.
If I get some time.

54
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,192
I'll give you 50 bucks.

55
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,113
Go fuck yourself.
You think I'm a charity?

56
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,033
Wait a minute.
Who's doing who a favour?

57
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,793
Who called who up, begging for a sub?

58
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,235
OK. I'm sorry. I appreciate it.

59
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,276
Anything for a friend.

60
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,672
Excuse me.

61
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
Mind if I take my cap off, ma'am?

62
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,192
No, of course not.

63
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,392
Thank you.

64
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,673
I think I know this hotel
better than my own apartment.

65
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,833
All the important people
come and stay here.

66
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,356
You know,
I used to be a pool boy here.

67
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,755
Anything I can do to help you?

68
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,956
I'll open the champagne for you.

69
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,999
- Open up the...?
- Julian. My name is Julian.

70
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,435
You don't have to open the champagne.

71
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,239
I will give you a tip, don't worry.

72
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,516
Jesus.

73
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,991
I'm sorry, Mrs Tolbin.
That's not what I meant. I was...

74
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,596
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,592
Is this your first time in LA?

76
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,269
- Maybe you can be a help to me.
- Yeah?

77
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,920
Well, I haven't been here for years,

78
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,629
and I was wondering if there are
any new good restaurants.

79
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,678
You know, where the famous people go?

80
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,194
Yeah, well...

81
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,068
it's probably safer to recommend
the more established restaurants.

82
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,315
There's...Ma Maison and La Scala...

83
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,278
Scandia.

84
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,599
And of the newer ones,
I hear that Le Dome is quite nice.

85
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,238
Very popular.

86
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,392
My, you are making me
thirsty just standing there.

87
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
Now you can open the champagne.

88
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,629
Pour me a drink...

89
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,676
and set the bottle down.

90
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,109
Yeah, she liked the pool boy bit.

91
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,356
I'm going to see her
again tomorrow afternoon.

92
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,998
Yeah.

93
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,036
OK, Anne. Love you, too.

94
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,678
Paging Mrs Anderson.

95
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,909
Hey, pretty lady.

96
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,230
- Hi.
- Got my other jacket?

97
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,153
- Sure. Here you go, Julian.
- Thanks.

98
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,553
- Good evening, Mr Kay.
- How you doing?

99
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,198
Fine.

100
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,516
Then he has the nerve
to hit on my sister.

101
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,559
No, he's not.

102
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,279
I told you. He's looking right at us.

103
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,951
What'll it be?

104
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,474
No, that's OK, Jimmy.

105
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,476
Mr Kay would like another drink.

106
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,990
- Dry Manhattan on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,275
- You speak English.
- You speak English.

108
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,669
- You fooled me.
- And you me.

109
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
How long have you
been in Los Angeles?

110
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,311
I live here.

111
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,630
You live here? I don't understand.

112
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,793
You wouldn't. I'm just trying
to refresh my college French.

113
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,238
I usually practise with a friend,
but she's not here yet.

114
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,640
Where are you from?

115
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,109
I was born in Torino,

116
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,589
but I studied at Nantes.

117
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,750
You hardly have any accent at all.

118
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,593
Yeah, I've been travelling too much.

119
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,433
I envy you. I love to travel.

120
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,310
I used to travel a lot, but my
husband's involved in local politics.

121
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,755
So now I just practise French.

122
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,431
He thinks it's chic
to have a bilingual wife.

123
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,878
I think he's right.

124
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,678
Where are you going?

125
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,711
I made a mistake.

126
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,956
My husband's in New York.

127
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,158
What about your friend?

128
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,875
I'm not waiting for anyone.

129
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,196
- You still don't understand.
- Understand what?

130
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,236
Who I am.

131
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,556
Who are you?

132
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,149
You don't even understand
who you are, why you're sitting here.

133
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,116
Why are you here?

134
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,433
- I've got to go.
- All right. Just one thing.

135
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,829
Why did you come on to me?

136
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,832
Like I said, I made a mistake.

137
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,275
I heard you speaking French.

138
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,876
Often in these big hotels, you run
into women from foreign countries

139
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,919
who may need
a translator...or a guide.

140
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,353
And they hire you?

141
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,317
Yes.

142
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,037
How many languages do you speak?

143
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,076
Five or six.

144
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,518
Plus the...international language.

145
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,032
That's right.

146
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,949
Well, now,

147
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,396
you're something really
special, aren't you?

148
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,989
You're one to talk.

149
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,074
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.

150
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,832
I know what I see.

151
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,708
How much would you have charged me?

152
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,189
As what? Translator or guide?

153
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,158
No. Just one fuck.

154
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,753
Now you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.

155
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,957
You don't, huh?

156
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,999
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.

157
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,513
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Joste.

158
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,758
Look, someone's made a mistake here.
I don't do fags.

159
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,832
- I didn't mean that.
- Or couples.

160
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,718
No, no, no. You don't understand.

161
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,792
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.

162
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,711
Just her.

163
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,557
- But I can watch.
- Of course.

164
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,279
Would you like a drink?

165
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,757
Not yet.

166
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,470
- I think I'd like my money now.
- Sure. Sure.

167
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,239
- I like to talk after.
- Sure.

168
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,875
Hello, Judy.

169
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,669
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.

170
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,869
A very pretty woman. You'll like me.

171
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,872
I can tell...

172
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,958
because I like you. I like you.

173
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,874
So just relax and close your eyes.

174
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,758
Just relax
and let your mind run free.

175
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,475
Don't worry about anything.

176
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,996
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.

177
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,150
That's right. Close your eyes.

178
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,712
Forget about him.
This is just you and me.

179
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,837
No, no, no, from behind.

180
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,559
It has to be from behind.

181
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,876
Ok, baby, just flip over
on your stomach.

182
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,151
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,

183
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,789
'cause I'm going to take care of you.

184
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,954
I'm going to get you wet, very wet.

185
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,792
I know how to do this.

186
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,318
Now slap her.

187
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,793
Slap that cunt.

188
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,269
- Hey, Leon.
- How you doing, Jule?

189
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,198
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.

190
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,398
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his...boyfriends,

191
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,439
just banging away,
you know how it is. Dumb bastard.

192
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,069
- Hello, Julian.
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.

193
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,070
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.

194
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,833
I'm serious.
They want you back this week.

195
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,955
I wouldn't take much,
you know. It's...

196
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,473
They're regulars for me.

197
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,433
You lied, Leon.
It was a rough trick.

198
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,234
I forgot. You got scruples now, huh?

199
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,396
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.

200
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,914
They get possessive.

201
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,391
- I can't be possessed.
- Does that include Miss Anne?

202
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,232
Anne who?

203
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,313
I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.

204
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,633
I'll tell you why, Leon. She's got
a job coming up for me in a week.

205
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,517
Eight grand.

206
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,194
Can you get me that?

207
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,714
All right. All right.

208
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,916
Thanks, hon.

209
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,951
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
That bitch will sell you out.

210
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,158
But you really care about me,
don't you? Don't you, Leon?

211
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,196
You care.

212
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,312
You know, you walk
an awful thin line, Julian.

213
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,949
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
You're getting cocky.

214
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,352
The other boys are happy,
with a car, a house, but not you.

215
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,639
You got all your rich pussy lined up,
once- a-month tricks,

216
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,430
a dip in the pool,
a little tennis, and orgasm.

217
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,114
I'm just to warning you as a friend.

218
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,398
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.

219
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,113
You're sure about that?

220
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,430
They'll cut you out.

221
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,072
Yeah?

222
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,751
Says she's a friend?

223
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,831
Where does she know me from?

224
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,230
Yeah, send her up.

225
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,110
I'm Michelle.

226
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,795
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't hard.

227
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,836
Are you surprised?

228
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,956
What do you want?

229
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,912
I would have thought that you'd live
in a place with thick red carpet,

230
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,310
- big bed, mirrors on the ceiling...
- Bordello.

231
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,830
This is my apartment.
Women don't come here.

232
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,876
- You're going out?
- Yeah.

233
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,915
Business?

234
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,835
- Maybe.
- Isn't it a little late?

235
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,118
- Isn't it late for you?
- My husband's still in New York.

236
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,758
I'm alone.

237
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,873
I thought it would be easier.

238
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,712
What did you say?

239
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,473
I said I thought it would be easier.

240
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,118
What?

241
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,632
To be with you, to procure you.

242
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,875
I told you, you're mistaken.

243
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,468
Why are you doing this to me?

244
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,711
- What am I doing?
- Embarrassing me.

245
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,910
I'm not embarrassing you.

246
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,950
I can't keep up...

247
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,077
this front much longer.

248
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,196
I came here.

249
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,078
I found out who you were,
where you lived.

250
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,550
I came here
in the middle of the night.

251
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,878
I wanted to know what...
it would be like...to fuck you.

252
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,950
I brought money.

253
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,079
What more can I do? I...

254
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,513
I...

255
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,633
I like...

256
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,036
I don't want to know.

257
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,636
Don't say that.

258
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,112
You got me aroused
just thinking about it.

259
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,158
I'm lying here with a hard-on,
it's not even 10:00 yet.

260
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,996
Don't tease me.
Come on, baby, you're teasing me.

261
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,870
I'm gonna have to hang up
and jerk off right now. I am.

262
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,759
Yeah, I'm touching myself.
You like that, don't you?

263
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,072
Oh, come on, baby. Don't say that.

264
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,359
We're talking about having more
pleasure than you've had in years,

265
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,753
you got to bring up
some stupid little $1,200 stereo?

266
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,872
How much does your husband make?
What's he worth?

267
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,349
A couple of million?

268
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,194
Of course I could do without it.
I can listen to the radio.

269
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,236
The speaker's cracked.

270
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,992
Lisa. Lisa, listen to yourself.
You know what you're saying?

271
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,637
Can you hold on a second?
Somebody's at the door.

272
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,551
Good morning.

273
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,273
What do you want for breakfast?
Coffee, juice, croissant, eggs?

274
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,271
Julian Kay.

275
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,476
I want two coffee,
orange juice, croissant...

276
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,754
No eggs.

277
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,879
..one scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.

278
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,239
Lisa, I'm here with a hard-on,
people all over, I can't talk.

279
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,397
I'll see you about 5:00. Bye-bye.

280
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,390
So, what do you think?

281
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,556
About what?

282
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,430
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?

283
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,039
Was it what you expected?

284
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,157
No. It was like really making love.

285
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,910
I'm not used...

286
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,795
It's not what I expected.

287
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,158
Do you remember
what you said last night?

288
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,551
Yes.

289
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,158
Now, if I bid, I have to buy it.

290
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,468
Right.

291
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,916
The one I want is over here.
There it is.

292
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,434
What does it say?

293
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,231
"Jacobean, late 17th century".
Estimated at 4,800 to 5,200.

294
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,558
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.

295
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,153
Yeah.

296
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,997
I don't know. My guess is this
is gonna go for 5,000. 55 maybe.

297
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,474
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.

298
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,438
At 48, that's a bargain.
What do you think?

299
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,119
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I...don't know.

300
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,718
I saw a George lll chest around here
somewhere, going for, like, 22, 23.

301
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,429
It's a lot, but a good investment.
Beautiful lines on it.

302
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,877
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garnisher set over there...

303
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,270
- What is it?
- Do you see who I see?

304
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,238
- Who is it?
- It's Randolph Sloan's widow.

305
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,232
- A stockholder in Jim's company.
- She's still alive?

306
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,629
She's gonna make a beeline for us.

307
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,631
There goes the garnisher set.

308
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,030
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

309
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,114
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy
before they face us.

310
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,351
Lucille!

311
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,591
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?

312
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,240
- Just looking.
- Oh, how nice!

313
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,278
There is an exquisite
garnisher set over there!

314
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,669
Lucille,
this is Wilhelm Schoenfeld.

315
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,830
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.

316
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,990
Great hospitality, madame.

317
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,038
Oh, the dress! Look, the dress.

318
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,998
Beautiful dress. It goes
with her face. They're both beige.

319
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,035
Wilhelm.

320
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,755
Madame!

321
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,957
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.

322
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,792
Lisa, we must go.

323
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,391
Did you see her face?

324
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,438
Come on.

325
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,512
I wish your husband would come back.

326
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,636
- He has.
- Good.

327
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,834
I can't stop thinking about you.

328
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,476
Do you mind?

329
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,913
What have you been doing?

330
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,111
- When?
- This morning.

331
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,509
Driving around.

332
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,309
I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.

333
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,994
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.

334
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,355
Then I drove here.

335
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,710
You know, Michelle,

336
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,758
I'm really not part of your problems.

337
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,593
I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.

338
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,432
I brought money.

339
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,839
Don't...

340
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,917
I don't want your money.

341
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,600
I'll buy you something, then.

342
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,355
- I'll buy you that stereo.
- I got a stereo.

343
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,833
What, then?

344
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,795
Come on.

345
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,556
- What?
- We're going to my room.

346
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,597
- You want it?
- No.

347
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,638
Good, 'cause you're
not gonna get it.

348
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,433
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.

349
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,274
God. Why?

350
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,432
I don't know. It seems important.

351
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,909
We just made love, didn't we?

352
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,797
Yes.

353
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,792
Then you know everything
there is to know.

354
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,792
That's silly. Where are you from?

355
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,440
I don't know. I'm not from anywhere.

356
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,916
I'm from this bed.

357
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,192
Anything worth knowing, you can learn
by letting me make love to you.

358
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,517
That's not true.

359
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,115
Why do you sleep with older women?

360
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,234
I prefer older women.

361
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,834
Why?

362
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,674
What's the use of bringing
some high-schooler to climax?

363
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,958
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.

364
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,435
No challenge.

365
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,476
It has no meaning.

366
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,230
The other night...

367
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,278
That night I met you
at the hotel...

368
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,476
I was with a woman...

369
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,358
Somebody's mother.

370
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,474
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.

371
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,120
She hadn't had an orgasm in 10 years.

372
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,954
Took me 3 hours to get her off.

373
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,316
For a while,
I didn't think I could do it.

374
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,074
When it was over, I felt
like I'd done something worthwhile.

375
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,230
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?

376
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,439
My God.

377
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,752
These are not the handcuffs your wife
was wearing when she was killed.

378
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,479
Those we found in the study.

379
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,676
They were in a filing cabinet...

380
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,794
along with some dildos, paddles...
You know what I'm talking about.

381
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,318
Your private sex life is
of no concern to me or to the LAPD.

382
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,472
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted

383
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,157
suggests the killer may have
been a guest in your home once.

384
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,677
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.

385
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,515
However, I'll have to have
detailed information

386
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,149
about you and your
wife's sex practices...

387
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,677
and the names of any parties
that were involved. All right?

388
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,189
Sorry. Here you go. This, too.

389
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,714
I get the Salvation Army.

390
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,797
Mrs Stewart.

391
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,960
Hi. Excuse me.
Does Mr Julian Kay live here?

392
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,793
I'm Detective Sunday.

393
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,350
I'm with the homicide bureau.
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

394
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,273
What do you want?

395
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,555
You're Mr Kay?

396
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,996
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?

397
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,310
Come on.

398
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,789
I'm walking into Westwood.
You want to talk there?

399
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,838
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later.

400
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,671
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.

401
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,716
You heard about the case?

402
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,110
- Yeah. It was in the paper, right?
- Yeah.

403
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,668
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.

404
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,718
- Yeah, I read about that.
- I bet.

405
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,631
- Cup of coffee?
- Sure!

406
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,790
We'll sit in the back.

407
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,874
Now, what were you doing
Tuesday night?

408
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,513
Tuesday.

409
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,955
Tuesday night, I was...

410
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,989
I was with a friend
at a pre-auction viewing.

411
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,469
She'll verify that?

412
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,031
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.

413
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,032
I think she enjoys her privacy.

414
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,910
..if that's what this is
to you. OK? I don't want it!

415
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,228
Come over here.

416
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,751
You can't mix May and December.
It just never...

417
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,117
Maybe she likes the guy, huh?

418
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,872
- I'm sorry.
- Am I a suspect?

419
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,509
No, but we'll have to check
your alibi for your sake.

420
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,673
Now, this work that you were
doing for the Rheimans,

421
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,389
was this as a translator
or a chauffeur?

422
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,950
Neither. This was...

423
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,112
This was more of a personal matter.

424
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,079
- You're friends?
- Not exactly.

425
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,430
Not exactly. All right, then.

426
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,116
What exactly is it
that you were doing for the Rheimans?

427
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,556
Nothing special.

428
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,358
Chit-chat. I don't know.

429
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,511
I have a hard time remembering
these things. I meet a lot of people.

430
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,751
Yes, yes.
No, I understand your problem.

431
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,719
You got there, you had a few drinks.
Next thing, you're back in LA?

432
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,109
More or less.
You want another cup of coffee?

433
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,431
That's bullshit. I'm taking you in.
It'll be good for your memory.

434
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,116
You seem like a young man
who needs a little self-improvement.

435
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,231
Look, Mr Sunday...

436
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,276
Detective Sunday.

437
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,514
Look, Detective...

438
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,879
I want to cooperate with the police
in any way I can, but these...

439
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,394
these are very delicate matters...

440
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,071
things that may not fall
under the exact letter of the law.

441
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,750
Publicity's the last thing I want.

442
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,749
I'm not gonna book you or
take away your chauffeur's license.

443
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,550
I'm not gonna bring you up on drug
charges. I could do all of that.

444
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,596
Just tell me about the Rheimans.

445
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,511
Please welcome Charles Stratton.

446
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,271
Mack, thank you.

447
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,875
I hope you're having
as good a time as us...

448
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,159
trying to figure out
what the stuff is on our plates.

449
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,676
But most of all,
I'm happy to have the opportunity

450
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,911
to speak to you in an informal way

451
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,231
about the problems
facing southern California.

452
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,915
More than any other
community in the country...

453
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,639
Do you follow
California politics, Julian?

454
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,029
Not very much.

455
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,873
You're smart. They're all whores.

456
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,669
..but we also have the technological
means and know- how

457
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,117
to help free America
from the grip of fossil fuels.

458
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,636
In times of austerity like these,

459
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,315
it is the privileged
who should lead the way,

460
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,710
who should set an example
for the rest of the country.

461
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,872
This guy is a real comer.

462
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,038
She's pretty, isn't she?

463
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,792
Yes, very.

464
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,553
Jim, Thank you for coming.
You know Michelle.

465
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,150
Mrs Laudner, how nice of you to come.
It's a pleasure to see you.

466
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,515
Bullshit. Can we talk later?

467
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,433
Certainly. Mrs Laudner,
my wife Michelle.

468
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,748
How do you do?

469
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,231
- And this is Julian Kay.
- It's an honour. Enjoyed the speech.

470
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,036
Mrs Stratton.

471
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,750
You're a fortunate man, Senator.

472
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,550
- You know what he is.
- That boy will go far.

473
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,949
Got a nice wife, too.

474
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,112
- Tell me about them.
- I told you he's a comer.

475
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,954
No. I want to hear
about them as a couple.

476
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,157
- How is their marriage?
- Julian, you are incorrigible!

477
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,470
No, I want to hear about it.

478
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,516
I hear she's very unhappy.

479
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,238
- Julian!
- Well, hello.

480
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,595
What a surprise.

481
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,117
- You do a lot of shopping here?
- No. Just browsing.

482
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,838
Just browsing.

483
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,594
Well, I gotta go.
Lot of appointments.

484
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,355
Been very nice talking to you...
Mrs Stratton.

485
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,237
Wait.

486
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,911
I have to talk to you.

487
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,833
Yeah. Me, too.

488
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,836
Want to have a drink?

489
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,280
It's kind of early for a drink.

490
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,478
Maybe we do that in about an hour.
What do you think?

491
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,516
I think you're awful.

492
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,397
I think you're right.

493
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,833
Come on.

494
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,394
I've seen your husband
on television.

495
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,079
He's very impressive.

496
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,116
What's that supposed to mean?

497
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,948
Nothing. I'm sorry.

498
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,998
I would never do anything
to hurt him politically.

499
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,351
I could never leave him.

500
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,795
Don't let him blackmail you.

501
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,077
He has this big
political thing about...

502
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,118
having...a family.

503
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,518
He keeps wanting me to be pregnant.

504
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,958
What are we talking about here?
What he wants or what you want?

505
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,510
I can't tell any more.

506
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,157
What can I do?

507
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,231
I don't know.

508
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,389
Be yourself.

509
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,311
Leave him?

510
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,472
His career will survive.

511
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,437
People forget.

512
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,958
These things have to
be done quietly.

513
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:12,276
Don't let him fool you with his talk
about duty and self- sacrifice.

514
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,195
He's getting exactly what he wants.
You've got to do the same.

515
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,748
Take your pleasure when you can.

516
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,238
How about you? Where do you come in?

517
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,437
How do you get pleasure?

518
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,910
What a surprise. Mr Kay.

519
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,911
Detective Sunday.

520
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,037
You are full of surprises.
Come on in. Sit down.

521
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,432
- Take a shine. You need it.
- Thank you. You're dressed up today.

522
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,351
I'm going to the country club.

523
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,228
To the country club.
We checked on your alibi.

524
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,110
Mrs Williams said you had
been with her Tuesday night.

525
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,436
But...

526
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,909
you dropped her off at 7:00.

527
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,195
The Rheiman murder was at 10:00.

528
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,315
Shit.

529
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,310
I described the house, the bedroom.

530
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,516
She said
you were helping her redecorate

531
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,034
and you'd been picking
out a bureau...

532
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,271
I understand why.
She has a reputation to protect.

533
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,831
How do you do it, Julian?

534
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:50,472
This afternoon with Mrs Jarvey
and tonight at the country club.

535
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,189
How do you seduce
all these women, huh?

536
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,193
I don't like you poking around
in my private life, Sunday...

537
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,794
bugging my friends.

538
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,797
I'll tell you what.
You lay off my clients,

539
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,872
I'll give you a few pointers
picking up women.

540
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,792
How's that?

541
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,713
First, obviously, you dress for shit.

542
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,510
Anybody can fix that, no problem.
It's your face. Bad face.

543
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,434
And that body? You have back
problems? You look like a monkey.

544
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,159
Hey, back. Shoulders back.

545
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,676
And your jaw, work the jaw.
Exercise. You don't want it slack.

546
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,194
Up tight, tight. Tight, yes.

547
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,631
Would you be willing
to come in for a line- up?

548
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,910
- Sure. Why not?
- Doesn't it ever bother you, Julian?

549
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,150
- What?
- What you do.

550
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,952
Giving pleasure to women?
I'm supposed to feel guilty?

551
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,556
- But it's not legal.
- Legal is not always right.

552
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,757
Men make laws.
Sometimes they're wrong.

553
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,278
They're stupid...or jealous.

554
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,396
And you know better?

555
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,670
Some people are above the law.

556
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,672
How do these people
know who they are?

557
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,159
They know.

558
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,433
They ask themselves.

559
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,956
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.

560
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,109
Yes, sir.

561
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,472
- May I?
- Please.

562
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,597
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.

563
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,118
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs Rheiman?

564
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,079
- I didn't.
- Yeah, you said that.

565
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,720
That's why I checked twice
with the coroner.

566
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,236
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.

567
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,630
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.

568
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,998
Underneath the cuts were bruises from
where she was handcuffed earlier.

569
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,277
The coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,

570
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,715
which would be the night
you were there.

571
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,349
Jesus Christ.

572
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,477
She was beaten with
a heavy metal object,

573
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,632
raped and violated...with an object,

574
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,472
presumably the murder weapon.

575
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,312
Yeah.

576
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,594
Yeah, I handcuffed her.

577
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,078
But you gotta understand about
these people...like the Rheimans.

578
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,356
It's like a game to them.

579
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,913
I'll explain.

580
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,633
Julian.

581
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,632
Yeah? What is it?

582
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,836
They were here two hours...
the police.

583
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,799
They were here two hours.
They had a search warrant.

584
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,552
It's all right. It's OK.

585
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,312
What's going on?

586
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,320
Jill, it's Julian.

587
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,231
No, it's OK, it's OK.

588
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,072
Send the maid up now.

589
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,199
Hi. How you doing, Timmy?

590
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,274
Julian! You're becoming
a regular visitor. What's happening?

591
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,590
There's something
I want to talk about.

592
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,319
I don't like anybody
here when Tim visits.

593
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,916
Courts might not
let me see him at all.

594
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,309
Let's go down to the beach, then.

595
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,715
Watch out.

596
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,277
Thank you.

597
00:57:01,677 --> 00:57:03,747
I think I'm in a frame.

598
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,829
- Who's putting you in?
- I don't know.

599
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:09,306
All I see is a frame.

600
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:12,195
It's that Rheiman murder
out in Palm Springs.

601
00:57:12,277 --> 00:57:14,347
You tricked with them?

602
00:57:14,437 --> 00:57:17,235
Once. Just once. Favour to Leon.

603
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:20,707
- Two-timing bastard.
- I'm nice. I can't help it.

604
00:57:20,797 --> 00:57:22,515
You check around for me?

605
00:57:22,597 --> 00:57:25,316
Why don't you ask
your new friend Leon?

606
00:57:25,397 --> 00:57:27,786
I may just do that.

607
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:31,392
You trick for other people,
cheat me out of money,

608
00:57:31,477 --> 00:57:35,516
and then when you need a favour,
you come back to me.

609
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:40,346
If I help you...
you'll have to help me.

610
00:57:41,397 --> 00:57:42,386
How?

611
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:47,187
You'll have to come back to me,
work strictly for me.

612
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:50,349
Wait a minute.
It's got nothing to do with that.

613
00:57:50,437 --> 00:57:53,588
Like shit it doesn't.
I made you, Julie.

614
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:57,192
I taught you everything you know,
how to dress, how to behave,

615
00:57:57,277 --> 00:57:59,552
how to treat women, how to make love.

616
00:57:59,637 --> 00:58:03,755
Then you say, "I'm too good for you,"
and cut me out.

617
00:58:03,837 --> 00:58:06,226
It ain't right, Julie.

618
00:58:07,437 --> 00:58:10,588
Things are different.
I'm more than I used to be.

619
00:58:12,237 --> 00:58:16,389
I'm getting older, Anne.
I got to keep moving forward.

620
00:58:16,477 --> 00:58:19,435
Please, Julie, save me the speeches.

621
00:58:21,157 --> 00:58:25,070
- How's your Swedish coming?
- I'll be ready.

622
00:58:25,157 --> 00:58:27,227
She's flying in
from Stockholm on Thursday.

623
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:32,710
She apparently has certain
sexual idiosyncrasies.

624
00:58:32,797 --> 00:58:36,107
Are you going to come back with me?

625
00:58:39,197 --> 00:58:43,190
- You did it, didn't you?
- What?

626
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:46,235
The Rheiman killing.

627
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:56,353
Don't worry, Julie.
It doesn't matter.

628
00:59:04,277 --> 00:59:06,996
Thank you.
It's been a wonderful evening.

629
00:59:11,997 --> 00:59:15,546
- Can I see you again tomorrow?
- How about this one?

630
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:19,266
There was a sexy
girl from Borgan Place...

631
00:59:22,117 --> 00:59:24,073
Do you live alone?

632
00:59:26,357 --> 00:59:28,746
It's such a sweet face.

633
00:59:37,117 --> 00:59:39,995
- No, not yet.
- Why not?

634
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,149
- Let's just kiss some more, OK?
- What's wrong?

635
00:59:45,157 --> 00:59:48,115
Nothing's wrong. I just don't...
want to make love.

636
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:57,110
I love to be with you.

637
00:59:57,197 --> 01:00:00,826
I love it when you kiss me
and when you touch me,

638
01:00:00,917 --> 01:00:03,875
but when you make love,
you go to work.

639
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,592
If it's your period, I don't mind.

640
01:00:09,677 --> 01:00:12,669
Don't give me that.
You know what I'm talking about.

641
01:00:12,757 --> 01:00:14,987
I can't give you any pleasure,

642
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:17,989
and you can't fool me any more.

643
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:20,068
You don't know what you're saying.

644
01:00:20,157 --> 01:00:23,115
Yes, I do...and so do you.

645
01:00:33,437 --> 01:00:36,747
Yeah, I know.

646
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:42,670
You're talking about me giving up
what I am, what I do.

647
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,513
Is that so shocking?

648
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:55,150
I care about you. I really do.

649
01:01:00,997 --> 01:01:03,431
That's still not enough.

650
01:01:07,757 --> 01:01:09,793
It's all I'm good at.

651
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:12,833
That's not true.

652
01:01:14,157 --> 01:01:17,467
It doesn't matter.
I can't quit anyway.

653
01:01:17,557 --> 01:01:20,993
If I quit, I'm out on a limb.

654
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:24,752
Well, then we'd be even.
I'm already out on one.

655
01:01:29,517 --> 01:01:32,429
People I know
take care of each other.

656
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:37,906
I need their protection.

657
01:01:41,717 --> 01:01:46,233
I'm being framed by somebody.
I don't know who.

658
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:52,036
There was a murder, Palm Springs,
a couple weeks ago.

659
01:01:52,117 --> 01:01:54,108
Police think I did it.

660
01:01:55,877 --> 01:01:59,028
It was a woman. A woman I met once.

661
01:02:00,757 --> 01:02:03,715
I wasn't there,
but my alibi completely denies it.

662
01:02:03,797 --> 01:02:07,756
- Why would anyone do that to you?
- I can't figure that out.

663
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:11,193
- It doesn't make any sense.
- When was the murder?

664
01:02:11,277 --> 01:02:13,347
A week ago Tuesday.

665
01:02:15,957 --> 01:02:20,508
- Weren't we together that night?
- Baby, I wish we were.

666
01:02:34,757 --> 01:02:37,112
All right,
boys, stand full-face, please.

667
01:02:37,197 --> 01:02:38,710
This is bullshit. These cops...

668
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,357
Number three, take off your glasses.

669
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:47,193
Number two, straighten up.

670
01:02:48,277 --> 01:02:49,835
Turn to your right.

671
01:02:52,277 --> 01:02:54,552
No, Number three, to your right.

672
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:55,831
Jerk.

673
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,873
How much you getting paid?

674
01:02:57,957 --> 01:03:01,188
What are you talking about?
I'm just a con.

675
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,826
So am I. I'm getting 15.

676
01:03:05,957 --> 01:03:08,630
- You are?
- Yeah. 15 bucks.

677
01:03:08,717 --> 01:03:10,548
Now left, please.

678
01:03:13,037 --> 01:03:14,356
Left.

679
01:03:16,837 --> 01:03:18,190
Thank you.

680
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:25,026
- The wino's getting 20.
- You're kidding.

681
01:03:25,117 --> 01:03:28,075
You ain't getting paid,
you're getting screwed.

682
01:03:28,157 --> 01:03:30,512
Shit! What the fuck's going on?

683
01:03:30,597 --> 01:03:33,395
I want to speak to my lawyer!

684
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,071
You'll see your lawyer.
Get in line.

685
01:03:36,157 --> 01:03:38,273
Make sure I speak to him.

686
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:41,667
Number one, turn to your right.

687
01:03:41,757 --> 01:03:46,114
I know my rights. This isn't Russia.
We have a constitution here.

688
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:50,827
- I know my rights.
- Thank you. You can leave now.

689
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:53,795
How about this fuckin' jerk
here, three.

690
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:57,711
You getting paid, too?
What the fuck is going on?

691
01:04:00,677 --> 01:04:03,669
Well, what do you think?

692
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:07,067
- Not bad.
- I'm gonna steal your thunder.

693
01:04:07,157 --> 01:04:09,466
He's teaching me how to dress.

694
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:12,310
This is Lieutenant Curtis
from Palm Springs.

695
01:04:12,397 --> 01:04:14,194
He's...

696
01:04:14,277 --> 01:04:18,555
- He's in charge of this case.
- Wait a minute. I thought you were?

697
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:22,232
No, I'm in charge
of pimps, prostitutes and hustlers.

698
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:25,992
Pretty low on the pole.
Good joke, huh?

699
01:04:30,397 --> 01:04:32,115
You've been identified, Julian.

700
01:04:33,597 --> 01:04:35,553
- Julian.
- By whom?

701
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:38,151
Who could possibly identify me?

702
01:04:38,237 --> 01:04:41,195
You parked 50 feet
from the Rheiman house

703
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,233
around 10:00 on the 22nd,

704
01:04:43,317 --> 01:04:46,673
proceeded up the street
and entered the house.

705
01:04:47,757 --> 01:04:51,227
- Someone saw you.
- I request formal charges...

706
01:04:51,317 --> 01:04:55,276
I don't understand.
Who would say this? I was not there.

707
01:04:55,357 --> 01:04:58,554
Then she identified
subject number one.

708
01:04:59,637 --> 01:05:03,425
Then she wasn't sure
which one of you it was.

709
01:05:06,997 --> 01:05:10,990
- You got the license number?
- She didn't see it.

710
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,829
- Shit!
- Right.

711
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:14,350
Here.

712
01:05:15,437 --> 01:05:18,907
We looked around your house.
We had a warrant.

713
01:05:18,997 --> 01:05:21,465
- We know.
- You recognise these?

714
01:05:21,557 --> 01:05:24,674
- They were under your mattress.
- So what?

715
01:05:24,757 --> 01:05:29,069
They had Mrs Rheiman's fingerprints
all over them. That's so what.

716
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:32,115
- Did you find the jewels?
- What jewels?

717
01:05:32,197 --> 01:05:35,507
I read the paper, too.
Jewels stolen from Rheiman's house.

718
01:05:35,597 --> 01:05:38,509
Whoever planted that money
probably planted the jewels.

719
01:05:38,597 --> 01:05:40,155
There were no jewels.

720
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:43,627
Didn't you ever wonder
this may be a frame?

721
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:47,426
- It occurred to us.
- It occurred to you.

722
01:05:47,517 --> 01:05:50,907
- Did you check Rheiman?
- He has an alibi.

723
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:54,626
- Big deal.
- You're grasping at straws.

724
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,390
What about Leon James, the black guy?

725
01:05:57,477 --> 01:06:01,834
- He said you were high-class.
- What do you think?

726
01:06:09,357 --> 01:06:11,552
I think you're guilty as sin.

727
01:06:11,637 --> 01:06:14,390
I think you went to the Rheimans',

728
01:06:14,477 --> 01:06:17,310
did a trick,
played some rough games.

729
01:06:17,397 --> 01:06:20,230
You got drugged or stupid or both.

730
01:06:20,317 --> 01:06:24,390
You beat her, killed her,
stole the money and the jewels.

731
01:06:25,797 --> 01:06:29,551
Then there's no use talking further
until you press charges.

732
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:33,550
Whether we think Julian's guilty...
we're not going to arrest him.

733
01:06:33,637 --> 01:06:35,309
If you're being framed,

734
01:06:35,397 --> 01:06:38,787
you're gonna be more use to us
floating around.

735
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:43,835
Can we go now?

736
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:58,754
Just one more thing, Julian...

737
01:07:00,397 --> 01:07:03,787
don't tell cons
they get paid for line- ups.

738
01:07:03,877 --> 01:07:06,835
Some cops don't have
a sense of humour.

739
01:08:04,397 --> 01:08:07,116
Hi. I'm here
to see Mrs Williams.

740
01:08:07,197 --> 01:08:11,190
- I'm Julian Kay.
- I'll take care of this, Wilma.

741
01:08:11,277 --> 01:08:16,749
- Julian, why are you here?
- Can I talk to you?

742
01:08:16,837 --> 01:08:18,793
What about?

743
01:08:21,037 --> 01:08:23,153
Were the police here?

744
01:08:23,237 --> 01:08:25,353
There was a detective here.

745
01:08:25,437 --> 01:08:29,112
I was very surprised
you used my name.

746
01:08:29,197 --> 01:08:32,587
I'm very, very sorry
about that, Lisa,

747
01:08:32,677 --> 01:08:35,430
but this is very important to me.

748
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:37,508
I told him the truth.

749
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:42,273
Lisa, you didn't,
I was with you until after midnight.

750
01:08:42,357 --> 01:08:44,188
That's not the truth.

751
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:46,632
Julian, I can't...

752
01:08:46,717 --> 01:08:48,514
you weren't here.

753
01:08:48,597 --> 01:08:50,508
What is it, dear?

754
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:51,916
This is Julian Kay,

755
01:08:51,997 --> 01:08:55,307
the one who is helping
with the decorating.

756
01:08:55,397 --> 01:09:00,187
The boy who said he was with me
the night of that murder.

757
01:09:00,277 --> 01:09:04,793
Mr Kay, it's bad enough
you made a fool of my wife

758
01:09:04,877 --> 01:09:06,833
But then spreading lies...

759
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:09,829
- Leave us alone.
- I wasn't lying.

760
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:14,672
Whatever you did, you won't
to get out of it by dragging...

761
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:17,112
I just came here for the truth.

762
01:09:17,197 --> 01:09:21,588
- I know you're lying.
- How do you know I'm lying?

763
01:09:21,677 --> 01:09:26,467
Because I was here with my wife
the entire evening.

764
01:09:26,557 --> 01:09:28,309
Thank you, Mr Kay.

765
01:10:31,597 --> 01:10:33,792
You're not very good at this.

766
01:10:33,877 --> 01:10:37,074
- What?
- Following people. You're lousy.

767
01:10:37,157 --> 01:10:40,513
- What are you talking about?
- Who's paying you?

768
01:10:40,597 --> 01:10:43,634
- You're not a cop.
- I'm calling the police.

769
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:46,470
You want to call? Go ahead, call.

770
01:10:46,557 --> 01:10:48,593
What have we got here?

771
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,032
Floyd...Floyd Wicker. Nice name.

772
01:10:51,117 --> 01:10:53,426
Born 7-23-52.

773
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:55,348
Hawthorne Avenue, LA.

774
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:57,428
Driver's license, American Express,

775
01:10:57,517 --> 01:11:00,236
Mastercharge,
picture of girlfriend...

776
01:11:00,317 --> 01:11:03,832
So-so,
eyes too close together, Floyd.

777
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:05,794
What else have we got?

778
01:11:05,877 --> 01:11:07,947
California State
Congressional Library pass,

779
01:11:08,037 --> 01:11:11,552
California State identification,
California...

780
01:11:12,997 --> 01:11:15,386
State Senate pass...

781
01:11:15,477 --> 01:11:17,388
Senator Charles Stratton.

782
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:20,947
- Who the fuck are you?
- You can read.

783
01:11:25,037 --> 01:11:26,186
Here.

784
01:11:26,277 --> 01:11:28,108
You work for Senator Stratton?

785
01:11:30,437 --> 01:11:31,790
Yes.

786
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:38,150
- Why are you following me?
- I was told to.

787
01:11:38,237 --> 01:11:40,797
- By the senator?
- Who else?

788
01:11:40,877 --> 01:11:44,586
Why didn't he ask me
about my private life himself?

789
01:11:46,277 --> 01:11:49,633
Huh? You don't know. You don't know.

790
01:11:49,717 --> 01:11:53,187
Well, Floyd, I'm gonna
make this easy for you

791
01:11:53,277 --> 01:11:55,029
so you don't forget.

792
01:11:55,117 --> 01:11:57,153
This is my telephone number.

793
01:11:57,237 --> 01:12:01,788
Now, you tell...the senator
if he wants to talk to me...

794
01:12:01,877 --> 01:12:05,233
he can just give me a call,
all right?

795
01:12:05,317 --> 01:12:08,275
Now, you fuck off
and leave me alone!

796
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:40,592
I received your message, Mr Kay.

797
01:12:42,397 --> 01:12:45,707
- Thought I'd see you.
- Good evening, Senator.

798
01:12:45,797 --> 01:12:48,391
- A vodka tonic.
- Yes, sir.

799
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:51,435
This is heartwarming.

800
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:55,192
Nice to see you haven't lost touch
with your constituency.

801
01:12:55,277 --> 01:12:58,952
I'm not talking as a senator,
but as a husband.

802
01:12:59,037 --> 01:13:01,631
That's too bad. I'm not a wife.

803
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:05,115
Very funny.

804
01:13:06,197 --> 01:13:07,835
What do you want?

805
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:11,432
- Want?
- I know who you are.

806
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:14,077
I can't stop my wife being a fool,

807
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:17,547
but I can stop her
from being blackmailed.

808
01:13:21,757 --> 01:13:26,069
- I don't know what you mean.
- You don't?

809
01:13:26,157 --> 01:13:30,548
The police think you're involved
in a murder in Palm Springs.

810
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:34,835
Three days later,
you seduced my wife at a fund-raiser

811
01:13:34,917 --> 01:13:37,511
to blackmail me into helping you.

812
01:13:39,837 --> 01:13:43,193
- You're crazy, mister.
- Am I?

813
01:13:55,757 --> 01:13:59,545
Last night, my wife asked me
about the Rheiman murder.

814
01:13:59,637 --> 01:14:02,947
Didn't make any sense
till I heard about you.

815
01:14:04,077 --> 01:14:06,307
You talked to Michelle about this?

816
01:14:09,197 --> 01:14:11,153
You're not gonna blackmail me.

817
01:14:11,237 --> 01:14:13,387
You don't know anything about this.

818
01:14:13,477 --> 01:14:16,549
But I do know a whore when I see one.

819
01:14:16,637 --> 01:14:18,195
How much?

820
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:23,272
Not to see your wife again?

821
01:14:27,397 --> 01:14:29,149
5,000.

822
01:14:32,637 --> 01:14:35,231
You'll have the cash in the morning.

823
01:14:39,597 --> 01:14:42,953
I'm seeing Michelle
because I want to see her...

824
01:14:43,037 --> 01:14:45,631
and because she wants to see me.

825
01:14:47,117 --> 01:14:49,756
I don't want a dime from you.

826
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:04,434
That may be even simpler.

827
01:15:04,517 --> 01:15:08,476
You live off the good graces
of a few people,

828
01:15:08,557 --> 01:15:12,596
like Mrs Andros,
who was at the door a minute ago...

829
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:15,237
and of places such as this.

830
01:15:15,317 --> 01:15:17,273
You're just a hanger-on.

831
01:15:17,357 --> 01:15:21,475
Unless you want to find
a new crowd to hang onto,

832
01:15:21,557 --> 01:15:23,513
don't see my wife again.

833
01:16:24,397 --> 01:16:26,911
- How you doing?
- Not bad. How about you?

834
01:16:26,997 --> 01:16:29,465
I'm looking for Leon James.
Seen him around?

835
01:16:29,557 --> 01:16:32,196
Yeah. He's probably at Probe.

836
01:16:32,277 --> 01:16:34,472
OK. Thanks. Take care.

837
01:17:04,677 --> 01:17:06,030
Hey, Julie.

838
01:17:57,197 --> 01:17:59,267
Hey, Jason.

839
01:17:59,357 --> 01:18:01,996
I haven't seen you lately.
What brings you here?

840
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:03,988
Have you seen Leon around?

841
01:18:04,077 --> 01:18:07,353
Oh, yeah.
He was showing off his new boy.

842
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:09,997
I think he's over there someplace.

843
01:18:10,077 --> 01:18:11,829
OK, thanks.

844
01:18:30,077 --> 01:18:32,989
Hey, Julie!
I thought that was you.

845
01:18:33,077 --> 01:18:36,149
I've been looking for you.
I want to talk.

846
01:18:36,237 --> 01:18:38,831
- Let's go out back.
- OK.

847
01:18:40,077 --> 01:18:42,591
What you doing here?

848
01:18:42,677 --> 01:18:45,191
You...coming from a funeral?

849
01:18:45,277 --> 01:18:48,155
I hear you're
showing off a new boy.

850
01:18:48,237 --> 01:18:52,549
I'm gonna make sure none
of these fruits snatch him from me.

851
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:59,391
You heard anything
about the Rheiman killing?

852
01:18:59,477 --> 01:19:01,433
That's all I've heard about.

853
01:19:01,517 --> 01:19:04,077
Cops on my ass like white on rice.

854
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:09,185
- They're giving me the third degree.
- Everybody else, too.

855
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,507
I may need your help.

856
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:13,792
I don't have an alibi.

857
01:19:14,877 --> 01:19:16,993
You're the one that sent me.

858
01:19:18,637 --> 01:19:20,389
You need one?

859
01:19:21,597 --> 01:19:23,076
Yeah.

860
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:25,387
I'll see what I can do.

861
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:35,147
Who do you think killed her?

862
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:38,228
If I was the police,

863
01:19:38,317 --> 01:19:42,993
I'd be more interested in Rheiman.
He's a freak, you know.

864
01:19:43,077 --> 01:19:47,309
He's a freak...
but he's got an alibi.

865
01:19:47,397 --> 01:19:49,308
An alibi?

866
01:19:50,477 --> 01:19:53,913
Julie, I got something working
tonight, a little thing.

867
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:57,353
I'll cut you in on it
if you're interested.

868
01:19:57,437 --> 01:19:59,314
Straight?

869
01:19:59,397 --> 01:20:02,070
This time of night? Are you serious?

870
01:20:03,157 --> 01:20:05,751
Leon, I'm sick of doing your shit.

871
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:08,954
No more fag stuff.
No more kink. Nothing.

872
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:12,791
- Finito! Got it?
- I heard about your problems.

873
01:20:12,877 --> 01:20:14,833
What problems?

874
01:20:14,917 --> 01:20:18,307
Your clientele, Julie,
your rich pussy.

875
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:21,673
They won't touch you.
They say it's too hot.

876
01:20:21,757 --> 01:20:25,796
- They're looking for new boys.
- Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em!

877
01:20:25,877 --> 01:20:28,152
Hey, Julie, listen...

878
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:31,991
you ask me to help you
out of a tight spot,

879
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,954
I'm glad to do it.

880
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:37,950
But I ask you to do my trick,
you say no.

881
01:20:38,037 --> 01:20:41,950
Now, how you expect me
to help you, huh?

882
01:20:43,837 --> 01:20:46,271
You give me the alibi,
then we'll talk about tricks.

883
01:21:07,677 --> 01:21:11,113
- I have to talk to you.
- Hey, baby.

884
01:21:11,197 --> 01:21:13,392
God, I'm glad to see you.

885
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:18,593
Are you OK? You look so worn out.

886
01:21:18,677 --> 01:21:20,508
I didn't sleep much.

887
01:21:20,597 --> 01:21:23,748
- Want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

888
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,395
I'll get my shoes.

889
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:33,750
What's wrong?
Are you gonna tell me about it?

890
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:39,391
Hey.

891
01:21:40,797 --> 01:21:43,595
Hey...you.

892
01:21:47,597 --> 01:21:49,474
Come on, tell me.

893
01:21:50,677 --> 01:21:53,987
When I said I didn't want
to make love to you,

894
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:57,274
I didn't mean it. I want to fuck you.

895
01:21:57,357 --> 01:21:59,666
I always want to fuck you.

896
01:22:09,477 --> 01:22:12,833
- Is that what you came to tell me?
- No.

897
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:16,227
Charles asked me to leave
for two months,

898
01:22:16,317 --> 01:22:20,629
till the primaries are over.
I'm going to Rome.

899
01:22:25,037 --> 01:22:26,595
Two months...

900
01:22:29,717 --> 01:22:32,914
I'll be back. Wait for me.

901
01:22:36,797 --> 01:22:40,710
I don't know if I can.
The police searched my apartment.

902
01:22:40,797 --> 01:22:43,516
- Maybe Charles...
- That's not what I'm saying.

903
01:22:51,957 --> 01:22:54,152
I don't know what I'm saying.

904
01:23:03,197 --> 01:23:07,031
All my life...I've been
looking for something.

905
01:23:07,117 --> 01:23:08,914
I don't even know what it is.

906
01:23:08,997 --> 01:23:11,830
- Let me...
- Maybe you're what I'm looking for.

907
01:23:17,037 --> 01:23:20,712
I gave Charles my word.
I've got to go.

908
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:24,592
It'll be all right.

909
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,754
Yeah.

910
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:31,067
I have to leave.

911
01:27:53,797 --> 01:27:55,276
Shit!

912
01:29:20,997 --> 01:29:24,194
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

913
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:27,349
- Tell me.
- I don't know. Honest.

914
01:29:27,437 --> 01:29:29,997
The police have been
here all morning.

915
01:29:30,077 --> 01:29:33,956
- Another cop's in his room.
- Does he call in?

916
01:29:34,037 --> 01:29:35,834
I'm not supposed to tell.

917
01:29:35,917 --> 01:29:39,990
OK. Next time he calls in
I've gotta talk to him.

918
01:29:40,077 --> 01:29:42,432
Ask if I can meet him.

919
01:29:54,637 --> 01:29:58,027
Do you know a blonde kid
that hangs around with Leon James?

920
01:29:58,117 --> 01:30:00,187
Nah. Couldn't tell you.

921
01:30:16,357 --> 01:30:20,430
Anne, I'm sorry.
I've got to talk to you.

922
01:30:21,517 --> 01:30:24,236
I can't now.
I'm looking for somebody.

923
01:30:24,317 --> 01:30:26,751
Perino's? Look, I don't have time.

924
01:30:28,437 --> 01:30:31,509
Yeah, all right, Perino's. Yes, 8:30.

925
01:30:45,037 --> 01:30:47,107
Jill, this is Julian.

926
01:30:48,597 --> 01:30:51,634
Yeah, I know.
You got some messages for me?

927
01:30:55,557 --> 01:30:57,115
Michelle?

928
01:31:01,357 --> 01:31:03,712
Tell her to meet me at Perino's.

929
01:31:08,077 --> 01:31:10,068
Son of a bitch, it's Rheiman.

930
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:44,955
Mr Julian.
You can't come in like this.

931
01:31:45,037 --> 01:31:46,868
I was working. I forgot.

932
01:31:46,957 --> 01:31:49,915
- I'll get you a jacket.
- No, it's OK.

933
01:31:55,637 --> 01:31:58,197
Julie, you look like shit.
What's wrong?

934
01:31:58,277 --> 01:32:01,553
- Everything. Straight bourbon.
- What are you doing?

935
01:32:01,637 --> 01:32:05,516
The way you look
you couldn't get a maid to fuck you.

936
01:32:05,597 --> 01:32:10,432
Anne, the cops are after me. They're
framing me for the Rheiman murder.

937
01:32:10,517 --> 01:32:13,270
- Where have you been?
- Looking for somebody.

938
01:32:13,357 --> 01:32:15,109
Last night?

939
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:19,395
Mrs Farfter came in last night
on a flight from Stockholm.

940
01:32:19,477 --> 01:32:23,516
There was no one there to meet her.
She was furious.

941
01:32:23,597 --> 01:32:26,475
I've got hell to pay. What happened?

942
01:32:26,557 --> 01:32:28,275
Did you hear me?

943
01:32:28,357 --> 01:32:31,872
I said the cops are after me...
for murder.

944
01:32:31,957 --> 01:32:33,913
So you stand me up.

945
01:32:33,997 --> 01:32:35,908
Jesus Christ!

946
01:32:38,077 --> 01:32:39,635
What do you want?

947
01:32:44,837 --> 01:32:46,589
Are you gonna help me?

948
01:32:47,677 --> 01:32:52,148
I've checked around, Julie.
You are in trouble.

949
01:32:52,237 --> 01:32:54,432
That's why I need your help.

950
01:32:54,517 --> 01:32:57,077
You never did anything for me.

951
01:32:57,157 --> 01:32:58,909
Never did anything for...

952
01:32:58,997 --> 01:33:03,468
- I'm your number-one boy.
- And you fight me every turn.

953
01:33:03,557 --> 01:33:07,994
You ask favours, then blow a gig
I worked six months to arrange.

954
01:33:08,077 --> 01:33:11,149
- I explained that already.
- I'm through, Julie.

955
01:33:11,237 --> 01:33:13,432
You'll have to fend for yourself.

956
01:33:13,517 --> 01:33:16,873
I don't care
what happens to you any more.

957
01:33:28,957 --> 01:33:30,913
Excuse me. I'll be back.

958
01:33:44,237 --> 01:33:48,515
Julian, thank God you got my message.
I've been looking for you.

959
01:33:48,597 --> 01:33:50,792
It's all right, baby. It's OK.

960
01:33:50,877 --> 01:33:54,552
No, it's not all right.
Charles talked to the DA.

961
01:33:54,637 --> 01:33:57,913
They found the weapon.
They're going to arrest you.

962
01:33:57,997 --> 01:34:00,227
That can't be. It can't be.

963
01:34:00,317 --> 01:34:02,626
What are you going to do?

964
01:34:02,717 --> 01:34:04,594
I don't know.

965
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:12,066
What can I do to help?

966
01:34:12,157 --> 01:34:15,115
- Nothing.
- There's gotta be something.

967
01:34:15,197 --> 01:34:17,950
Don't you understand?
I'm in big trouble.

968
01:34:18,037 --> 01:34:20,028
- Just stay away.
- No.

969
01:34:20,117 --> 01:34:23,826
There's gonna be a scandal.
You know what a scandal is?

970
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:27,034
You know what that's like?
Stay away from me.

971
01:34:27,117 --> 01:34:30,712
I'll ruin your life, your husband's.
It's all over.

972
01:34:30,797 --> 01:34:32,435
Not if you're innocent.

973
01:34:33,717 --> 01:34:38,552
How do you know I'm innocent?
Look at me, right in the face

974
01:34:38,637 --> 01:34:42,312
Can you tell me without hesitation
you know I'm innocent?

975
01:34:42,397 --> 01:34:43,955
Yes.

976
01:34:49,957 --> 01:34:51,515
Listen, forget me.

977
01:34:51,597 --> 01:34:53,189
Is someone in there?

978
01:34:53,277 --> 01:34:54,835
I never loved you.

979
01:37:05,517 --> 01:37:08,714
- Julie?
- Let me in. It's important.

980
01:37:12,957 --> 01:37:16,996
You look terrible.
You want to clean up, shave?

981
01:37:17,077 --> 01:37:21,593
I'm sorry to bug you this late.
I've been looking for you.

982
01:37:23,877 --> 01:37:25,435
I'm listening.

983
01:37:27,077 --> 01:37:31,195
You got my alibi ready?
I'm gonna need it today.

984
01:37:31,277 --> 01:37:33,916
It's not ready yet, Julie. Tomorrow.

985
01:37:33,997 --> 01:37:36,192
I'm still piecing it together.

986
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:40,952
It's not easy.
I'm trying to get it right.

987
01:37:41,037 --> 01:37:44,268
- Why are you framing me?
- What?

988
01:37:44,357 --> 01:37:48,873
Judy Rheiman's murder...
you were behind it. You, Rheiman,

989
01:37:48,957 --> 01:37:52,233
your cute little blonde
boyfriend in the bedroom there,

990
01:37:52,317 --> 01:37:55,115
who planted the jewels in my car.

991
01:37:55,197 --> 01:37:57,665
I don't know
what you're talking about.

992
01:37:57,757 --> 01:38:00,510
What the fuck is that, then?

993
01:38:00,597 --> 01:38:04,033
He's the one that
actually killed her, isn't he?

994
01:38:06,197 --> 01:38:08,427
Leon, what happened?

995
01:38:08,517 --> 01:38:12,351
You sent him out there
with Rheiman and his wife,

996
01:38:12,437 --> 01:38:15,110
he got rough and he killed her.

997
01:38:15,197 --> 01:38:17,074
Shut your fucking face!

998
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:20,388
I never saw that shit
before in my life.

999
01:38:20,477 --> 01:38:22,707
I want to know one thing.

1000
01:38:22,797 --> 01:38:26,233
What will it cost
to get you off my back?

1001
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:28,877
You ain't talking money,
you're talking murder.

1002
01:38:28,957 --> 01:38:31,869
- How much?
- I feel sorry for you.

1003
01:38:31,957 --> 01:38:33,185
How much?

1004
01:38:34,797 --> 01:38:38,153
It don't make no difference
how much, Julie.

1005
01:38:38,237 --> 01:38:41,115
The other side will always pay more.

1006
01:38:58,597 --> 01:39:00,792
Got it on real tight, huh?

1007
01:39:05,317 --> 01:39:08,468
You're real proud
of yourself, aren't you?

1008
01:39:08,557 --> 01:39:12,516
The police found the murder weapon
a block from your apartment.

1009
01:39:13,597 --> 01:39:15,588
That bitch in Palm Springs

1010
01:39:15,677 --> 01:39:20,592
is gonna change her mind
any time now and identify you.

1011
01:39:21,677 --> 01:39:25,113
Police want you real bad, Julie.

1012
01:39:25,197 --> 01:39:27,153
Now they got you.

1013
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:47,755
Look, I'm worth maybe...
20, 30 grand. It's yours.

1014
01:39:52,517 --> 01:39:55,190
I'll break your new boys for you.

1015
01:39:58,317 --> 01:40:00,672
I'll work just for you.

1016
01:40:00,757 --> 01:40:02,509
Just for you, Leon,

1017
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:05,111
40/60 split.

1018
01:40:05,197 --> 01:40:07,267
It's fair, 40/60.

1019
01:40:08,357 --> 01:40:09,870
40...

1020
01:40:11,357 --> 01:40:13,313
30/70. I'll...

1021
01:40:15,077 --> 01:40:17,671
I'll do fag tricks. I'll do kink.

1022
01:40:17,757 --> 01:40:20,476
I'll do anything you want me to!

1023
01:40:22,357 --> 01:40:25,394
Leave me alone and get out, Julie.

1024
01:40:31,557 --> 01:40:33,309
Why me?

1025
01:40:35,277 --> 01:40:37,268
Why did you pick me?

1026
01:40:38,397 --> 01:40:42,470
Because you were framable, Julie.

1027
01:40:44,397 --> 01:40:47,309
You stepped on too many toes.

1028
01:40:47,397 --> 01:40:49,957
Nobody cared about you.

1029
01:40:51,037 --> 01:40:54,029
I never liked you much myself.

1030
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:57,748
Now get out.

1031
01:41:03,597 --> 01:41:06,350
Who's down there?

1032
01:41:07,877 --> 01:41:10,391
Your new boyfriend? You motherfucker!

1033
01:41:14,077 --> 01:41:15,715
Oh, my God!

1034
01:41:15,797 --> 01:41:20,313
Don't let me fall!
Please, Julie, help me!

1035
01:41:20,397 --> 01:41:23,070
Don't fall. I need you.

1036
01:41:23,157 --> 01:41:24,954
Give me your hand.

1037
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,392
- Reach up.
- I'm trying.

1038
01:41:28,477 --> 01:41:30,354
Help me. Help me, please!

1039
01:41:30,437 --> 01:41:33,907
God! Don't fall!

1040
01:42:45,397 --> 01:42:47,991
Julian!
Would you answer a few questions?

1041
01:42:49,077 --> 01:42:52,513
- Who was involved?
- How old are you?

1042
01:42:52,597 --> 01:42:56,112
How long had you
been seeing Mrs Rheiman?

1043
01:42:56,197 --> 01:43:00,827
- Any Hollywood notables?
- How much money have you made?

1044
01:43:00,917 --> 01:43:03,715
Julian, give me an exclusive.

1045
01:43:03,797 --> 01:43:07,472
How much do you get for a trick?

1046
01:43:07,557 --> 01:43:10,355
Give me a break, Julian.

1047
01:43:10,437 --> 01:43:13,668
Do you feel
you're being framed, Julian?

1048
01:43:13,757 --> 01:43:16,794
Were you ever afraid of the husbands?

1049
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:43,670
I wish I had arrested you earlier.

1050
01:43:43,757 --> 01:43:45,987
It would've been easier
for everybody.

1051
01:43:46,077 --> 01:43:48,466
You'd better end
this pretrial publicity.

1052
01:43:48,557 --> 01:43:51,515
We're moving him
to Palm Springs soon.

1053
01:43:54,237 --> 01:43:56,512
You have anything to say, Julian?

1054
01:44:07,317 --> 01:44:09,069
Julian?

1055
01:44:13,157 --> 01:44:14,510
No.

1056
01:44:47,517 --> 01:44:49,269
Hello, Julian.

1057
01:44:50,557 --> 01:44:52,548
Going away on your trip?

1058
01:44:52,637 --> 01:44:55,026
No. I decided not to.

1059
01:44:57,357 --> 01:45:00,747
- Does your husband know you're here?
- No.

1060
01:45:02,637 --> 01:45:04,229
Why did you come?

1061
01:45:06,797 --> 01:45:10,073
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

1062
01:45:14,357 --> 01:45:16,188
Don't come back, Michelle.

1063
01:45:24,597 --> 01:45:26,872
Are you satisfied with your lawyer?

1064
01:45:28,317 --> 01:45:29,989
It doesn't matter.

1065
01:45:31,237 --> 01:45:32,875
Don't go.

1066
01:45:55,517 --> 01:45:59,476
Michelle Stratton is paying
for my services, Julian.

1067
01:45:59,557 --> 01:46:03,630
I think you know this is
a matter of some secrecy.

1068
01:46:07,397 --> 01:46:09,274
Tell her not to bother.

1069
01:46:09,357 --> 01:46:11,951
Julian, you'll have to help us more.

1070
01:46:15,157 --> 01:46:17,352
You tell Michelle to forget me.

1071
01:46:19,997 --> 01:46:22,795
I'm more worried
about your defence, Julian,

1072
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:25,550
than about her private life.

1073
01:46:25,637 --> 01:46:29,710
We'll must go into the details
the night of the murder.

1074
01:46:29,797 --> 01:46:32,755
The maid saw you trying to save Leon,

1075
01:46:32,837 --> 01:46:36,147
so the police are only pressing
the Rheiman case.

1076
01:46:36,237 --> 01:46:39,354
The papers and TV
are trying you already.

1077
01:46:39,437 --> 01:46:42,509
The police aren't
investigating any more.

1078
01:46:42,597 --> 01:46:46,112
We need some help, some facts,

1079
01:46:46,197 --> 01:46:49,030
to get the investigation going again.

1080
01:46:49,117 --> 01:46:52,029
Then we can find out
about Leon, Rheiman...

1081
01:46:52,117 --> 01:46:53,630
maybe the blonde boy.

1082
01:46:55,477 --> 01:46:57,229
How about it, Julian?

1083
01:47:11,917 --> 01:47:13,270
Lieutenant Curtis?

1084
01:47:13,357 --> 01:47:15,825
Yes, Mrs Stratton. This is an honour.

1085
01:47:15,917 --> 01:47:17,555
May I sit?

1086
01:47:18,757 --> 01:47:22,033
I was told you wanted to see me.

1087
01:47:22,117 --> 01:47:26,554
I want to talk to you about
the Julian Kay/Rheiman murder case.

1088
01:47:26,637 --> 01:47:28,195
Yes.

1089
01:47:28,277 --> 01:47:30,632
I'm paying
for Mr Kay's defence.

1090
01:47:31,717 --> 01:47:33,355
I know.

1091
01:47:33,437 --> 01:47:37,953
I'm paying for Mr Kay's defence
because I know he's not guilty.

1092
01:47:38,037 --> 01:47:40,597
I don't want
an obstruction of justice.

1093
01:47:40,677 --> 01:47:43,191
How do you know he's not guilty?

1094
01:47:43,277 --> 01:47:46,428
Because he wasn't
in Palm Springs that night.

1095
01:47:46,517 --> 01:47:49,827
- No?
- No. He was with me.

1096
01:48:05,237 --> 01:48:08,274
I told them, Julian.

1097
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:10,712
I heard.

1098
01:48:12,397 --> 01:48:15,150
You didn't have to do that, Michelle.

1099
01:48:15,237 --> 01:48:17,432
You could have forgotten me.

1100
01:48:17,517 --> 01:48:19,473
I'd rather die.

1101
01:48:23,917 --> 01:48:26,477
What will you do now?

1102
01:48:26,557 --> 01:48:30,391
I don't know. I can't go home.

1103
01:48:30,477 --> 01:48:33,674
The newsmen
are waiting outside for me.

1104
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:35,713
There's dozens of them.

1105
01:48:39,957 --> 01:48:41,834
Why did you do it?

1106
01:48:44,197 --> 01:48:46,427
I had no choice.

1107
01:48:47,597 --> 01:48:49,553
I love you.

1108
01:48:57,157 --> 01:48:59,432
My God, Michelle...

1109
01:49:01,437 --> 01:49:04,747
it's taken me so long
to come to you.

1110
01:51:44,317 --> 01:51:47,275
English
