00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,797
All right. Just one thing.

177
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,675
Why did you come on to me?

178
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,844
Like I said, I made a mistake.

179
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,139
I heard you speaking French.

180
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,268
Often in these big hotels,

181
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,395
you run into women
from foreign countries

182
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,816
who may need a translator or a guide.

183
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,279
And they hire you?

184
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,573
Yes.

185
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,497
How many languages do you speak?

186
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,042
Five or six.

187
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:26,550
Plus the, uh, international language.

188
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,179
That's right.

189
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,188
Well, now,

190
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,067
you're something really special,
aren't you?

191
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,531
You're one to talk.

192
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,036
I saw you sitting here. You wanted me
to come over. I came over.

193
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,039
I know what I see.

194
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,877
How much would you have charged me?

195
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,296
As what? Translator or guide?

196
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,714
No.

197
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,591
Just one fuck.

198
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,638
Now, you've made a mistake.
I don't do that.

199
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,973
You don't, huh?

200
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:20,062
I know what I see, too, Monsieur Kay.

201
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,276
It's been a pleasure talking to you,
Madame Jost.

202
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,154
Don't spoil it. Bonne chance.

203
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,772
Look, mister,
someone's made a mistake here.

204
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,023
I don't do fags.

205
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,608
MAN: I didn't mean that.

206
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,401
And I don't do couples, either.

207
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,112
No, no, no. You don't understand.

208
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,616
It's just my wife Judy. Not me.

209
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,411
- Just her.
- Okay.

210
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,207
- But I can watch.
- Of course.

211
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,543
Would you like a drink?

212
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,217
Not yet.

213
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,971
I think I'd like my money now.

214
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,849
Oh, sure. Sure.

215
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,229
- I like to talk afterwards, too.
- Sure.

216
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,641
Hello, Judy.

217
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,312
You're a very sexy lady,
a very good-looking woman.

218
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,609
Very pretty woman.
You're gonna like me.

219
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,696
I can tell.

220
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,450
Because I like you. I like you.

221
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,289
So just relax and close your eyes.

222
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,043
Just relax and let your mind run free.

223
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,090
Don't worry about anything.

224
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,635
I can take care of you.
I know what you want.

225
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,476
That's right. Close your eyes.

226
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,188
Forget about him.

227
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,275
This has nothing to do with him.
This is just you and me.

228
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,903
Oh, no, no, no, from behind.

229
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,156
It has to be from behind.

230
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,914
Okay, baby,
just flip over on your stomach.

231
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:53,501
Just relax. Don't worry.
Leave everything to me,

232
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,547
'cause I'm gonna take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of you.

233
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm gonna get you wet.
I'm gonna get you very wet.

234
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,554
I know how to do this.

235
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,390
Now slap her.

236
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,023
Slap that cunt.

237
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,744
Hey, Leon.

238
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,205
- How you doing, Julie?
- All right.

239
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,046
I want to thank you
for helping me out, Julie.

240
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:43,593
Finally found Joey holed up
with one of his boyfriends,

241
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:47,597
just banging away, you know how it is.
Dumb bastard.

242
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,140
Hello, Julian.

243
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,227
- Hi. I'll just have a Perrier.
- Okay.

244
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,728
Okay.

245
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,692
You made quite a hit in Palm Springs.
They want you back.

246
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,071
I'm serious.
They want you to come back this week.

247
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,494
I wouldn't take much, you know. It's...
They're regulars for me.

248
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,123
You lied to me, Leon.
It was a rough trick.

249
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:19,170
I forgot. You got scruples now, huh?

250
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,883
I don't like playing
the same numbers too often.

251
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,302
They get possessive.

252
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,055
I can't be possessed.

253
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,766
That include Miss Anne?

254
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,352
Anne who?

255
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,440
Boy, I don't know why you fool around
with that dumb bitch.

256
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,941
I'll tell you why, Leon.

257
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,862
She's got a job coming up for me
in a week.

258
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,114
Eight grand.

259
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,283
Can you get me that?

260
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,453
All right. All right.

261
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,371
Thanks, hon.

262
00:22:55,624 --> 00:23:00,003
Just trying to warn you, that's all.
I mean, that bitch will sell you out.

263
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,632
But you really care about me, don't you?
(CHUCKLES) Don't you, Leon?

264
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,718
You care.

265
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,056
You know,
you walk an awful thin line, Julie.

266
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,726
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
I mean, you're getting awful cocky.

267
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,394
All the rest of the boys are happy

268
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,689

but not you.

269
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,986
You got all your rich pussy lined up,
once-a-month tricks,

270
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:29,407
a dip in the pool, a little tennis,
and orgasm.

271
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,410
I'm just trying to warn you as a friend.

272
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,998
If those bitches ever turn on you,
you're through.

273
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,461
You're sure about that?

274
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,797
They'll cut you out.

than you've had in years,

00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:32,640
Coffee, orange juice, croissant, eggs?

353
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,685
Julian Kay.

354
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,979
Yeah, I want two coffees,
orange juice, croissant...

355
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,230
No eggs.

356
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:43,359
...one scrambled egg
and a side of cottage cheese.

357
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,611
Lisa, this is really embarrassing.

358
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,238
I'm sitting here with a hard-on,

359
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,574
and there's people all over
and I can't talk to you now.

360
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,369
All right, I'll see you about 5:00.
Bye-bye, love.

361
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,998
(SCOFFS)

362
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,085
So, what do you think?

363
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,504
About what?

364
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,842
Did you make the right decision
to come here last night?

365
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,138
Was it what you expected?

366
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,475
No. It was like really making love.

367
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,438
I'm not used...

368
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,941
That's not what I expected.

369
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,529
Do you remember
what you said last night?

370
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,034
Yes.

371
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,415
WOMAN 1:
Now, if I bid on it, I have to buy it, right?

372
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,625
WOMAN 2: Right.

373
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,961
Well, now, the one I want is
right over here. There it is!

374
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,046
JULIAN: What does it say?

375
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,756
WOMAN 1: Uh, I saw one
just like that in Madam Wu's.

376
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,133
"Jacobean. Late 17th century."

377
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,386
It's estimated at $4,800 to $5,200.

378
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,098
This has been worked on.
There's glue in it.

379
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,433
Yeah.

380
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,310
I don't know.

381
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,689
My guess,
it's gonna go for $5,000, 55 maybe.

382
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,069
It's a great piece,
but it's not a great bargain.

383
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,989
Now, 48, that's a good bargain.
What do you think?

384
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,537
It's perfect for the guest room,
but I don't know.

385
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,749
You know, I saw a George III chest
around here somewhere

386
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,627
going for, like, 22, 23.

387
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,671
It's a lot of money,
but it's a good investment.

388
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,339
Beautiful lines on it.

389
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,343
Probably the best bargain is that
tacky garniture set over there...

390
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,845
- Uh-oh.
...if the Japs don't bid it up. What is it?

391
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,682
LISA: Do you see who I see?
JULIAN: Who is it?

392
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,725
LISA: It's Randolph Sloan's widow.

393
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,895
- She's a stockholder in Jim's company.
- Is she still alive?

394
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,356
She's gonna make a beeline
straight for us.

395
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,358
Ah, there goes the garniture set.

396
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,819
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

397
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,949
(IN GERMAN ACCENT)
Come, Lisa, we must face the enemy

398
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,575
before they face us.

399
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,161
Lucille!

400
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,915
How lovely to see you.
Are you buying or selling?

401
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,084
- Just looking.
- Oh, how nice.

402
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,796
Oh! There is an exquisite
garniture set over there.

403
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,507
Lucille, this is Willem Shoenvelt.

404
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,509
He's helping me redecorate
the guest house.

405
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,678
Great hospitality, madam.

406
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,474
Oh, the dress! Look, the dress.
Beautiful dress.

407
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,810
Goes well with the face.
They're both beige.

408
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,311
Willem.

409
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,355
- (ALL GASP)
- Oh! Madam!

410
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,107
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

411
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,985
- What is going on here?
- I don't know. So sorry.

412
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,486
Willem.

413
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,989
JULIAN:
Lisa, we must go, auf Wiedersehen.

414
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,950
(BOTH LAUGHING)

415
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,536
(EXCLAIMING)

416
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,876
- Did you see her face?
- I can't believe you did that!

417
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,388
JULIAN:
I wish your husband would come back.

418
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:44,266
- He has.
- Good.

419
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,651
I can't stop thinking about you.

420
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,446
Do you mind?

421
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,579
What have you been doing?

422
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,083
- When?
- This morning.

423
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,253
Oh, driving around.

424
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,091
(SIGHS) I drove to Anaheim,
then I drove to Long Beach.

425
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,760
I pumped my own gas in Long Beach.

426
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,013
Then I drove here.

427
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,976
You know, Michelle,

428
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,562
I'm really not part of your problems.

429
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,482
And I'm certainly not the solution
to your problems.

430
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,278
I brought money.

431
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,783
Don't...

432
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,120
I don't want your money.

433
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,123
I'll buy you something, then.

434
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,792
I'll buy you that stereo.

435
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,003
I got a stereo.

436
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,672
What, then?

437
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,007
(SPLASHING)

438
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:04,805
Come on.

439
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,602
- What?
- We're going to my room.

440
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,398
Bulgari. You want it?

441
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,566
No.

442
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,736
Good, 'cause you're not gonna get it.

443
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,365
Tell me everything about you.
Right now.

444
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,576
God. Why?

445
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,746
- I don't know. It seems important.
- (SIGHS DEEPLY)

446
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,333
We just made love, didn't we?

447
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,168
Yes.

448
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,255
Then you know everything
there is to know.

449
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,258
That's silly. Where are you from?

450
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,636
No. I'm not from anywhere.

451
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,265
I'm from this bed.

452
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,977
Anything worth knowing about me

453
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,771
you can learn from letting me
make love to you.

454
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,941
That's not true.

455
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,987
Why do you sleep with older women?

456
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,533
I prefer older women.

457
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,452
Why?

458
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,540
What's the use of bringing
some high schooler to climax?

459
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:41,545
Some silly teenager gets wet in the
movies and goes home to masturbate.

460
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,132
No challenge.

461
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,260
It has no meaning.

462
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,515
The other night,

463
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,602
that night I met you at the hotel,

464
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,813
I was with a woman.

465
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,649
Somebody's mother.

466
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,487
Her husband didn't care
about her any more.

467
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,908
This woman hadn't had an orgasm
in maybe 10 years.

468
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,621
It took me three hours to get her off.

469
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,374
For a while there, I didn't think
I was gonna be able to do it.

470
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:26,298
When it was over, I felt like I'd
done something, something worthwhile.

471
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:34,515
Who else would've taken the time
or cared enough to do it right?

472
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,978
My God.

473
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,189
These are not the handcuffs
your wife was wearing

474
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,691
when she was killed, Mr Rheiman.

475
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,361
Those we found in the study.

476
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,696
They were in a filing cabinet.

477
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,368
Along with some dildos,
some paddles and some...

478
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,577
You know what I'm talking about.

479
00:40:55,662 --> 00:41:01,333
Listen, your private sex life
is of no concern to me or to the LAPD.

480
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,421
However, the manner
in which your wife was assaulted

481
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:11,969
suggests the killer was, may have
been, a guest in your home once.

482
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:16,515
I'll try to keep what you tell me
in the strictest confidence.

483
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:21,145
However, I'm gonna have to have
detailed information

484
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,565
about you and your wife's sex practices.

485
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:30,988
The names of the parties, if any,
that were involved. All right?

486
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,420
Sorry. Here you go. And this, too.

487
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,630
So I get the Salvation Army.
Thanks a lot.

488
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,090
Yep.

489
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,426
Mrs Stewart.

490
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,931
Hi, excuse me.
Does Mr Julian Kay live here?

491
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,935
I'm Detective Sunday.

492
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,563
I'm with the Homicide Bureau,

493
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,814
and I'd just like to ask him
a few questions.

494
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,274
What do you want?

495
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,194
You're Mr Kay?

496
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,530
Hello, I'm Detective Sunday.
How are you?

497
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,783
Come on.

498
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,620
Look, I'm walking into Westwood.
Do you wanna talk there?

499
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,664
- Sure.
- I'll pick that stuff up later, Jill.

500
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,299
I'm investigating the Rheiman murder
from the Los Angeles area.

501
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,968
You heard about the case?

502
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,638
Yeah, that's the one
that was in the paper, right?

503
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,889
Yeah.

504
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,226
- Palm Springs.
- Right again.

505
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,603
Yeah, I think I read
something about that.

506
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,687
Yeah, I bet you did.

507
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,481
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

508
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,650
Listen, we'll sit in the back.

509
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,240
And what were you doing
Tuesday night?

510
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,826
Tuesday.

511
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,913
- WOMAN: Or people.
- Tuesday night, I was...

512
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:09,127
I was with a friend at a pre-auction
viewing at Sotheby Parke Bernet.

513
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,171
She'll verify that?

514
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,550
We're talking about a woman
of substance here.

515
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,845
- I think she enjoys her privacy.
- WOMAN: I don't want this any more.

516
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,891
...if that's what this is to you, okay?
I don't want it! I don't want it!

517
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,978
Come over here.

518
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:31,024
You can't mix May and December.
It just... (LAUGHS)

519
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:32,776
Yep.

520
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,362
You like cigars?

521
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,489
I'm sorry.

522
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,824
Am I a suspect?

523

All right, now, this work that you
were doing for the Rheimans,

526
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,627
was this as a translator or a chauffeur?

Neither. This was...

528
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,592
This was more of a personal matter.

or for the Rheimans?

you sat around, you had a few drinks.

00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,574
Some people are above the law.

696
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,828
Well, how do these people
know who they are?

697
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,329
They know.

698
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,417
They ask themselves.

699
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,587
Eugene, thanks.
I'll take care of you in a minute.

700
00:55:41,714 --> 00:55:43,381
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

701
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,592
- May I?
- Please.

702
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,762
Yeah, the other one
could use some work.

703
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,934
Why didn't you tell me
you handcuffed Mrs Rheiman?

704
00:55:57,438 --> 00:55:59,188
I didn't.

705
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,315
Yeah, you said that.

706
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:04,569
That's why I went back and had it
checked it twice with the coroner.

707
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,905
Apparently, she must have
put up quite a struggle.

708
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,492
There were cuts on her wrists
from being handcuffed.

709
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,203
But underneath the cuts
there were bruises

710
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,872
from where she was handcuffed earlier.

711
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,375
Now the coroner estimates
about 48 hours earlier,

712
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,627
which would be the night
you were there.

713
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,467
Jesus Christ.

714
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,180
Now, she was beaten
with a heavy metal object,

715
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:35,641
raped and violated with an object,

716
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,477
presumably the murder weapon.

717
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,997
Yeah.

718
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,001
Yeah, I handcuffed her.

719
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,090
But you gotta understand
about these people,

720
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,008
like the Rheimans.

721
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:15,681
It's like a game to them.

722
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,102
I'll explain.

723
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,317
JILL: Julian.

724
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,362
Yeah? What is it?

725
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,156
They were here two hours, the police.

726
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:33,366
They were here two hours.

727
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,535
I couldn't stop them.
They had a search warrant.

728
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,870
It's all right, Jill. It's okay.

729
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,664

Jill, it's Julian.

732
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,032
No, it's okay. It's okay.

733
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,909
Send the maid up now.

734
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,347
Hi. How you doing, Timmy?

735
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,143
Julian! You're becoming
a regular visitor.

736
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,936
What's happening?

737
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,565
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

738
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,109
I don't like to have anybody
in the house when Tim visits.

739
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,154
Courts might not let me see him at all.

740
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,991
Let's go down to the beach, then.

741
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,474
Watch out.

742
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,852
Thank you.

743
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,067
I think I'm in a frame.

744
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,653
- Who's putting you in?
- I don't know.

745
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,988
All I see is a frame.

746
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,659
It's that Rheiman murder.
Out in Palm Springs.

747
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,619
You tricked with them?

748
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,372
Once. Just once. Favour to Leon.

749
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:48,501
- Two-timing bastard.
- So I'm a nice guy. I can't help it.

750
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,419
You check around for me?

751
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,214
Why don't you ask
your new friend Leon?

752
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:55,174
I may just do that!

753
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,845
You trick for other people,
you cheat me out of money,

754
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,224
and then when you need a favour,
you come back to me.

755
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,271
If I help you, you'll have to help me.

756
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:11,524
How?

757
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,403
You'll have to come back to me,
work strictly for me.

758
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:19,532
Wait a minute, now.
No, it's got nothing to do with that.

759
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,284
- Like shit it doesn't.
- No.

760
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,702
- I made you, Julie.
- Uh-huh?

761
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,787
I taught you everything you know,

762
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:29,083
how to dress, how to behave,
how to treat women, how to make love.

763
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,793
And then one day
you come to me and say,

764
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,337
"I'm too good for you," and cut me out.

765
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,298
It ain't right, Julie.

766
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,343
Things are different now.

767
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:40,886
I'm more than what I used to be.

768
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,975
I'm getting older, Anne.
I gotta keep moving forward.

769
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:49,270
- Just move.
- Please, Julie, save me the speeches.

770
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,858
How's your Swedish coming?

771
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,818
I'll be ready.

on Thursday.

773
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:02,074
She apparently has certain
sexual idiosyncrasies.

774
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:06,537
Are you going to come back with me?

775
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,625
You did it, didn't you?

776
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:14,837
What?

777
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,423

778
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,514
Don't worry, Julie.

779
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,224
It doesn't matter.

780
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,903

01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,685
He's in charge of this case.

869
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:04,937
Wait a minute. I thought you were.

870
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,815
No, not me. I'm in charge
of pimps, prostitutes and hustlers.

871
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,318
They keep me pretty low on the pole.
(LAUGHS) Good joke, huh?

872
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,617
You've been identified, Julian.

873
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,162
- Julian.
- By whom?

874
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,873
Who could possibly identify me?

875
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,501
You parked your Mercedes
about 50 feet from the Rheiman house

876
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,254
between 9:30 and 10:00
on the night of the 22nd.

877
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:33,882
Then you proceeded up the street,
entered the house.

878
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,845
- Someone saw you, Julian.
- I request formal charges...

879
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,347
I don't understand. I don't know
who would say this about me.

880
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,808
- Now, he's been apprised of his rights!
- I was not there.

881
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,769
Then she identified subject number one.

882
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:50,941
Then she wasn't sure
which one of you it was.

883
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,866
- You got the licence number?
- She didn't see it.

884
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,617
- Shit!
- Right.

885
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:02,828
Here.

886
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,374
We looked around your house
the other day. We had a warrant.

887
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,835
- We know.
- You recognise these?

888
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,545
No.

889
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,380
- They were under your mattress.
- So what?

890
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:18,010
They had Mrs Rheiman's fingerprints
all over it. That's so what.

891
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,180
- Did you find the jewels?
- What jewels?

892
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:24,683
I read the paper, too.
Jewels stolen from Rheiman's house.

893
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,770
Whoever planted that money
probably planted the jewels, too.

894
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,688
There were no jewels.

895
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:33,025
Didn't you ever wonder
this whole thing may be a frame?

896
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,860
It occurred to us.

897
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,529
It occurred to you.

898
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,574
- Did you check out Rheiman himself?
- He has an alibi.

899
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,243
Big deal, he's got an alibi. What about...

900
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,620
You're grasping at straws.

901
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,580
What about Leon James, the black guy
sent me out to Rheiman's?

902
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:50,292
He spoke very highly of you.
He said you were a high-class act.

903
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,211

You got drugged or stupid or both.

we're not gonna arrest him.

I was very surprised you used my name.

I'm very, very sorry about that, Lisa,

I told him the truth.

Have you seen him around?

1036
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:26,297
Oh, Leon? Yeah, he was here.

1037
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:29,425
He was showing off his new little boy.
A cute little blond kid.

1038
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,220
I think he's over there someplace.

1039
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,055
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

1040
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,535
LEON: Hey, Julie! I thought that was you.

1041
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:56,619
Homecoming?

1042
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:58,454
I've been looking for you. I wanna talk.

1043
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:00,081
Let's go out back where it's quiet.

1044
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,165
Okay.

1045
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,334
What're you doing here?

1046
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:08,131
You coming from a funeral?

1047
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,926
I hear you're showing off
a new boy here, Leon.

1048
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:15,597
Got to make sure none of these fruits
snatch him from me, too.

1049
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,104
You heard anything
about the Rheiman killing?

1050
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,981
That's all I've been hearing about.

1051
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,859
Cops on my ass like white on rice.

1052
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,111
They're giving me
the third degree, Leon.

1053
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:32,322
Everybody else, too, Julie.

1054
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,910
I may need your help.
I don't have an alibi.

1055
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,372
You're the one that sent me.

1056
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,751
You need one?

1057
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:46,961
Yeah.

1058
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,006
I'll see what I can do.

1059
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,516
Who do you think killed her?

1060
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:05,563
Well, if I was the police, I'd be more
interested in Rheiman himself.

1061
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:07,440
He's a freak, you know?

1062
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,445
Yeah, he's a freak. But he's got an alibi.

1063
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,614
An alibi? (CHUCKLES)

1064
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,327
Hey, Julie.
I got something working tonight.

1065
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:20,495
Little thing, you know.

1066
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:23,539
I thought I'd cut you in on it.
If you're interested, let me know.

1067
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:25,083
Straight?

1068
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:27,043
At this time of night? Are you serious?

1069
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,839
Leon, I'm sick of doing your shit.

1070
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,466
I mean, I'm sick of it! No more fag stuff.

1071
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,511
No more kink. Nothing. Finito. Got it?

1072
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,763
I heard about your problems.

1073
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:41,140
What problems?

1074
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:44,394
Your clientele, Julie. Your rich pussy.

1075
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,523
They won't touch you. Say it's too hot.

1076
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,358
They're looking for new boys.

1077
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,610
Fuck them! Fuck them!

1078
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:55,113
Hey, Julie, listen.

1079
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:59,325
You ask me
to help you out of a tight spot.

1080
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,035
I'm glad to do it.

1081
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,997
But I ask you to do my trick,
you tell me no.

1082
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:09,544
Well, how do you expect me
to help you? Huh?

1083
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:15,508
You give me the alibi,
and then we'll talk about tricks.

1084
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,146
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1085
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:38,281
I have to talk to you.

1086
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:41,659
Hey, baby! Oh, God!
I'm glad to see you!

1087
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:47,665
You okay? You better be.
You look so worn out.

1088
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,751
I didn't get much sleep.

1089
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:52,920
- You wanna go for a walk?
- Yeah.

1090
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,339
Okay, let me get my shoes.

1091
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:01,554
What's wrong?

1092
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:04,348
Are you gonna tell me about it?

1093
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,021
Hey!

1094
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,441
Hey! You.

1095
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:20,615
Come on. Tell me.

1096
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,286
When I said I didn't want
to make love to you the other day,

1097
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,038
I didn't mean it.

1098
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:30,374
I want to fuck you.
I always want to fuck you.

1099
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,304
Is that what you came to tell me?

1100
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,639
No.

1101
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:48,810
Charles asked me
to leave for two months.

1102
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,229
Till the primaries are over.

1103
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:52,980
I'm going to Rome.

1104
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,111
Two months.

1105
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,992
I'll be back! Wait for me.

1106
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,374
I don't know if I can.

1107
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:14,544
- The police searched my apartment...
- Maybe Charles could help.

1108
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:16,754
Don't... That's not what I'm saying!

1109

(SIGHS)

1110
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,932
I don't know what I'm saying.

1111
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,319
All my life I've been
looking for something.

1112
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,780
I don't even know what it is.

1113
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,825
- Let me do it...
- Maybe you're what I'm looking for.

1114
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,291
I gave Charles my word.

1115
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,043
I've got to go.

1116
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,130
It'll be all right.

1117
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:03,551
Yeah.

1118
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,803
I have to leave.

1119
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,121
(YELLS)

1120
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,662
Shit!

1121
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,463
JILL: I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

1122
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:17,633
- Tell me.
- I don't know. Honest. I'd tell you.

1123
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,928
The police have been here all morning.
His room's a mess.

1124
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:23,681
There's another cop waiting in his room.

1125
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:26,809
- Does he call in?
- I'm not supposed to tell.

1126
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,771
Okay, next time he calls in,
tell him that I've got to talk to him.

1127
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:31,939
Tell him it's important.

1128
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,190
Ask him if there's someplace
I can meet him.

1129
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,871
Do you know a blond kid

1130
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:49,373
that hangs around
with Leon James?

1131
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,042
Nah. Couldn't tell you.

1132
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:55,713
Eat shit, asshole.

1133
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:09,977
JULIAN: Anne, I'm sorry.

1134
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:13,355
I've got to talk to you.

1135
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:16,483
I can't now. I'm looking for somebody.

1136
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:21,030
Perino's? Look, I don't have time! I...

1137
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,115
Yeah, all right. All right. Perino's.

1138
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,742
Yes. 8:30.

1139
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,924
Jill? It's Julian.

1140
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:46,055
Yeah, I know, I know.
Got some messages for me?

1141
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,310
Michelle?

1142
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:58,067
Tell her to meet me at Perino's.

1143
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,531
Son of a bitch, it's Rheiman.

1144

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

1145
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:41,235
Mr Julian! You can't come in like this.

1146
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:42,861
I was working. I forgot my tie.

1147
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:46,240
- I'll have to give you a jacket.
- No, it's okay.

1149
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,042
Everything. Straight bourbon.

1150
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:58,836
What're you doing to yourself?

01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:02,423
The way you look now,
you couldn't get a maid to fuck you!

Anne, I need your help.

1153
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,510
The cops are after me.

1154
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:07,886
They're framing me
for the Rheiman murder.

1155
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:09,471
Where have you been?

1156
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:12,349
- I was looking for somebody.
- Last night?

1157
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,935
- What do you mean?
- Mrs Vakklar.

1158
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,187
She came in last night
on a flight from Stockholm.

1159
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:18,272
And she only speaks Swedish.

1160
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,482
Nobody could understand her
and there was no one there to meet her.

1161
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:21,567
- Anne...
- She was furious!

1162
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:23,444
The auto people are furious.
Now I've got hell to pay!

Didn't you prepare?

1164
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,613
Didn't you hear me?

1165
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:29,366
I said the cops are after me!
For murder!

1166
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:31,702

You are in trouble!

That's why I need your help.

1172

You never did anything for me.

1173
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,353
I never did anything for you...

01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,148
What are you talking about?
I'm your number one boy!

1175

And you fight me every turn.

1176
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,571
You ask a favour, and then stand up
a gig I worked for six months to set up!

1177
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,406
I explained that already. I told you.

1178
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:11,033
I'm through with you, Julie.

1179
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:14,036
You'll have to fend for yourself.

1180

what happens to you any more.

It's all right, baby. It's okay.

1185
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:56,328
No. No, it's not all right.
Charles talked to the D.A.

1186

They've found the murder weapon.
They're gonna arrest you.

1187
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:01,416
That can't be.

1188
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:04,628
What're you gonna do?

1189
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:07,756
I don't know.

1190
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:14,429
What can I do to help you?

1191
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,891
- There's nothing you can do.
- There's gotta be something.

1192
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:20,811
Don't you understand?
I am in big trouble!

1193
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,814
- Just stay away from me!
- No!

1194
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,316
It's gonna be a scandal.
You know what a scandal is?

1195
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,151
You know what that's like?

1196
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:31,446
Just stay away from me.
I'll ruin your life.

1197
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:33,949
Your husband's. It's all over.

1198
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:35,951
Not if you're innocent.

1199
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,204
If I'm innocent?
How do you know I'm innocent?

1200
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:42,291
- But you are...
- Look at me, right in the face!

1201
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:46,211
Can you tell me, without hesitation,
you know I'm innocent?

1202
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:47,462
Yes.

1203

You sent him out there.

You sent him out there, he got into
a scene with Rheiman and his wife.
