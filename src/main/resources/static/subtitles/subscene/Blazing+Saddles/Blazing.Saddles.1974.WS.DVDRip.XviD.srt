1
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:37,854
Come on, boys!

2
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:42,493
The way you're lollygagging around here
with them picks and them shovels...

3
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,440
...you'd think it was 120°...

4
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:48,990
It can't be more than 114.

5
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,299
Dock that Chink a day's pay
for napping on the job.

6
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:02,433
Now, come on, boys, where's your
spirit? I don't hear no singing.

7
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,307
When you were slaves,
you sang like birds.

8
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,374
Go on. How about a good
old nigger work song?

9
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:21,984
"I get no kick from champagne.

10
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:29,344
"Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.

11
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:34,556
"So tell me why should it be true...

12
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,378
"...that I get a belt out of you?

13
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,453
"Some get a kick from cocaine."

14
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,311
What the hell is that shit?

15
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:58,689
I meant a song. A real song.

16
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,252
Something like...

17
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,179
"Swing low, sweet chariot..."

18
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,919
Swing low? Sweet chariot?

19
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,552
Don't know that one, huh?

20
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:15,900
How about "De Camp Town Ladies"?

21
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,447
"De Camp Town Ladies"?

22
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:23,705
Ah, you know.

23
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:29,274
"De Camp Town Ladies sing this song,
doo-dah, doo-dah.

24
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:33,630
"De Camp Town race track five
miles long, all the doo-dah day!

25
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:37,625
"Gonna run all night,
gonna run all day.

26
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:41,467
"Bet my money on the bobtailed
nag, somebody bet on the bay!"

27
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:54,429
What in the wide, wide world
of sports is going on here?

28
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,208
I hired you people to try to get
a little track laid...

29
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,503
...not to jump around like a
bunch of Kansas City faggots!

30
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,545
Sorry, Mr. Taggart. I, I guess
we kind of got caught up.

31
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,069
Dummy, the surveyors say they may
have run into some quicksand up ahead.

32
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:08,346
Better check it out.

33
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:11,612
Okay, I'll send down a team of
horses to check out the ground.

34
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:16,408
Horses! We can't afford to lose
any horses, you dummy!

35
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,486
Send over a couple of niggers.

36
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:23,766
You and you.

37
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:29,210
Sir, he specifically requested
two niggers...

38
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:34,295
...but to tell a family secret,
my grandmother was Dutch.

39
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:37,684
Get on that hand car and take it
down to the end of that line!

40
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,421
Just trying to help you out.

41
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,738
I didn't know your grandma was Dutch!

42
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:51,927
"Oh, de Camp Town Ladies sing
this song, doo-dah, doo-dah.

43
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:57,044
"Camp Town race track five
miles long, oh, doo-dah day.

44
00:05:57,693 --> 00:06:01,206
"Going to run all night,
going to run all day.

45
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:05,210
"I waged my money on the bobtail nag,
somebody bet on the bay!"

46
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:11,121
Am I wrong...

47
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:15,444
...or is the world rising?

48
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,969
I don't know, but whatever
it is, I hate it.

49
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,701
Let me ask you something.

50
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:29,044
What is it that's not exactly water,
and it's not exactly earth?

51
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:31,481
Quicksand!

52
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,227
Oh, shit, quicksand!

53
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,745
Goddang, now we are in trouble!

54
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:43,735
They're in trouble!

55
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:47,640
Get your rope there.
Get over there quick.

56
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,767
Dang, that was lucky.

57
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:06,095
Doggone near lost a $400 hand cart.

58
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:17,169
Yeah, we can take it right off to the,
just a little bit to the left of that hill.

59
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,879
But we're going to die, Bart.
They're going to leave us here to die!

60
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:24,951
Take it easy, Charlie.
My foot is on the rail.

61
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,590
Then maybe down that canyon.
I think it's pretty level off there.

62
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:37,143
We can't swing back to the right
'cause of that hill there.

63
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:39,603
That looks like the way
we'll have to go from here.

64
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:43,439
Yes, we'll put her right down
through there over that ridge.

65
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,291
Well, boys, the break is over.

66
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:52,786
Don't just lay there getting a suntan.

67
00:07:53,143 --> 00:07:55,052
Won't do you any good, anyhow!

68
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:59,283
Take that shovel and put
her to some good use!

69
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:08,334
What?

70
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:09,909
Don't do that now!

71
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:14,037
I have to.

72
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:18,003
Send a wire to the main office
and tell them I said... OW!

73
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:23,759
Send wire, main office,
tell them I said, "Ow". Gotcha.

74
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:33,909
And right here, Mr. Lamarr, is
where we ran into quicksand.

75
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:36,171
Quicksand. Splendid.

76
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:40,074
And so the railroad has got
to go through Rock Ridge.

77
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:42,477
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Splendid.

78
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:44,398
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

79
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,732
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.

80
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,467
Be still, Taggart. Be still.

81
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:53,521
My mind is aglow with whirling,
transient nodes of thought...

82
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,878
...careening through a
cosmic vapor of invention.

83
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:57,836
Ditto!

84
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,329
Ditto? Ditto, you provincial putz!

85
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,088
I'm sorry, sir.

86
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:09,170
A plan. We need a plan.

87
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,692
What in the hell was that?

88
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:20,875
We can't hear ourselves think!

89
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:29,004
Sorry, your Worship, but I've got
two men home sick with the flu...

90
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:31,535
...and it's utter chaos down here.

91
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,806
I'll try to keep it
as quiet as possible.

92
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:36,043
But as you can see...

93
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:40,711
...this one is a doozey.

94
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,062
Yes, the Doctor Gillespie killings.
Well, do your best.

95
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,391
Now, let's see. Where were we?

96
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:53,649
Rock Ridge.

97
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:58,735
Yes, when that railroad
goes through Rock Ridge...

98
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,090
...that land will be worth
millions, and I want it!

99
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:07,020
I want that land so badly,
I can taste it.

100
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,535
There must be a way.

101
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:14,730
Clumsy fool!

102
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:18,759
Wait a minute! There might
be a legal precedent.

103
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:23,439
Of course! Land-snatching!

104
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:26,505
Land. La-land. "See 'Snatch'."

105
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:33,220
Haley vs. United States.
Haley, seven. United States, nothing.

106
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,169
You see, it can be done.
It can be done.

107
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:40,740
Unfortunately, there is one thing that
stands between me and that property.

108
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:42,348
The rightful owners.

109
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,865
There must be some way of scaring
them off, driving them out.

110
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:48,358
Getting rid of every human being
alive in that...

111
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,140
It's down the hall and to the left.

112
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:53,643
I've got it!

113
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:54,665
What? What?

114
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,768
I know how we can run
everybody out of Rock Ridge.

115
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:01,549
We'll kill the first-born male
child in every household!

116
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:04,682
Too Jewish.

117
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:11,781
We'll work up a Number Six on them!

118
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:13,511
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with that one.

119
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:15,785
That's where we go
riding into town...

120
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,865
...and a-whapping and a-whooping
every living thing...

121
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:20,583
...that moves within an inch
of its life!

122
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:22,667
Except the women folks, of course.

123
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:23,937
You spare the women?

124
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:28,098
No, we rape the shit out of them
at the Number Six dance later on!

125
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:30,500
That's marvelous! That's so creative!

126
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:33,282
Why, Taggart, you've been hurt!

127
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:36,579
That uppity nigger hit me
on the head with a shovel.

128
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,126
I'd sure appreciate it, sir, if
you could find it in your heart...

129
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,321
...to hang him up by his
neck until he was dead.

130
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:46,080
Got him locked up downstairs.

131
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,483
Consider it done, stout fellow.

132
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:58,689
I've got a special.
When can you work him in?

133
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,207
I couldn't possibly fit him in
until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid.

134
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:04,960
Monday. Splendid.

135
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,315
Thank you, sir.
And don't you worry.

136
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:17,001
We'll make Rock Ridge
think it's a chicken...

137
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,813
...that got caught in a tractor's nuts!

138
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:28,135
It's all right, Taggart. Just a man
and a horse being hung out there.

139
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:37,536
"There was a peaceful town
called Rock Ridge,

140
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,700
"...where people lived in harmony.

141
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:46,559
"They never had no kind of trouble.

142
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,882
"There was no hint of misery.

143
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:59,302
"The town saloon was always lively...

144
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:03,143
"...but never nasty or obscene.

145
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,980
"Behind the bar stood Anal Johnson.

146
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,397
"He always kept things nice and clean!

147
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:15,394
"And all at once the trouble started.

148
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,428
"A pack of murderers and thieves...

149
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:21,436
"...like swarms of locusts
they descended...

150
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,444
"...their aim to make
the townsfolk flee."

151
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,562
Well, that's the end of this suit!

152
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:04,515
Have you ever seen such cruelty?

153
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,609
"Now is a time of great decision.

154
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,009
"Are we to stay or up and quit?

155
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:24,601
"There's no avoiding this conclusion.

156
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:31,768
"Our town is turning into shit!"

157
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:42,232
Well, I don't have to tell you
good folks...

158
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:45,695
...what has been happening
here in our beloved town.

159
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:50,653
Sheriff murdered, crops burned...

160
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:54,520
...stores looted, people stampeded...

161
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:56,572
...and cattle raped!

162
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:03,194
Now the time has come to act.
And act fast!

163
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,448
I'm leaving.

164
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:12,569
You get back here, you old
pious, candy-ass sidewinder!

165
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,794
There ain't no way that nobody
is going to leave this town!

166
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:22,009
Hell, I was born here
and I was raised here...

167
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,508
...and goddamn it,
I'm going to die here!

168
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:28,279
And no sidewinder,
bushwhacking, hornswoggling...

169
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:32,732
...cracker croaker, is going
to ruin my biscuit-cutter!

170
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:40,990
Now who can argue with that?

171
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,651
I think we're all indebted
to Gabby Johnson...

172
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,756
...for clearly stating
what needed to be said.

173
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:52,662
I'm particularly glad that
these lovely children...

174
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,424
...were here today to hear that speech.

175
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,072
Not only was it authentic
frontier gibberish...

176
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:02,011
...it expressed a courage
little seen in this day and age!

177
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,212
What are we made of?

178
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,602
Our fathers came across the prairie...

179
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:12,567
...fought Indians, fought drought,
fought locusts, fought Dix!

180
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:16,406
Remember when Richard Dix came in here
and tried to take over this town?

181
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:18,966
Well, we didn't give up then...

182
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:23,383
...and by gum, we're not
going to give up now!

183
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,005
Olson Johnson is right!

184
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:35,349
What kind of people are we, anyhow?
I say we stay and fight it out!

185
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:40,919
Dr. Samuel Johnson is right about
Olson Johnson's being right.

186
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:43,066
And I'm not giving up
my ice cream parlor...

187
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:45,717
...that I built with these two hands
for nothing or nobody!

188
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:48,885
Howard Johnson is right!

189
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:56,916
Well, if we're going to stay, and
I think it's a big mistake...

190
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:02,170
...we're going to need a new sheriff.
Now, who is it going to be?

191
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:06,194
Why don't we wire the governor
to send us a sheriff?

192
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,662
Why should we get our own men killed?

193
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:12,410
Howard Johnson is right.
We'll wire the governor.

194
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:17,910
Then let us pray for the deliverance
of our new sheriff.

195
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:20,823
Will the congregation please rise?

196
00:17:22,426 --> 00:17:26,899
I shall now read from the books
of Matthew, Mark, Luke...

197
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:30,318
...and duck!

198
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:42,063
We've got to do something at once!

199
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:47,092
Governor, may I disturb
you for a moment, sir?

200
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:51,253
If you will just sign this, governor.
Right here.

201
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:52,917
Yes, what the hell is it?

202
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,550
Well, under the provisions
of this bill...

203
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:57,715
...we would snatch 200,000 acres
of Indian territory...

204
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,992
...which we have deemed unsafe
for their use at this time.

205
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:01,943
They're such children.

206
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:04,687
200,000 acres!
200,000 acres!

207
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,735
What will it cost, man?
What will it cost?

208
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,353
A box of these.

209
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:13,557
Are you crazy? They'll never go
for it, and then again they might.

210
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:16,367
The little red devils, they
love toys. May I try one?

211
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,690
These things are defective.

212
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,493
Right as usual, sir.

213
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,412
Show-off!

214
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:29,709
Just sign this, sir. Right here.

215
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,446
Okay, give us a hand here.

216
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:33,549
Work, work, work.

217
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:37,556
Hello, boys, have a good night's rest?
I missed you.

218
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:40,267
Just one more bill for you to sign, sir.

219
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,547
What is this?

220
00:18:41,814 --> 00:18:44,115
This is the bill that will convert
the State Hospital for the Insane...

221
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:47,733
...into the William J. Le Petomane
Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane.

222
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:48,850
Gentlemen, this...

223
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:51,378
...this bill will be
a giant step forward...

224
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,649
...in the treatment
of the insane gambler.

225
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,563
Yes, bravo! Beautiful.

226
00:18:58,709 --> 00:18:59,887
Thank you, Hedy. Thank you.

227
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:03,082
It's not Hedy. It's Hedley.
Hedley Lamarr.

228
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:05,617
What the hell are you worried about?

229
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,889
This is 1874.
You'll be able to sue her.

230
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,561
All right, help me in with this.

231
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,120
Just, ah, think of your secretary.

232
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:25,359
Ah, that was a very good suggestion.

233
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:29,010
Okay, is that it? Anything else?

234
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:31,468
Just this urgent telegram
from Rock Ridge.

235
00:19:31,924 --> 00:19:33,004
It arrived last Friday.

236
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:35,402
Read it, read it.

237
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:40,621
"Sheriff murdered. Church meeting
bombed. Reign of terror must cease.

238
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:42,482
"Send new sheriff immediately."

239
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,207
Holy underwear!

240
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,944
Sheriff murdered. Innocent women
and children blown to bits!

241
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:50,632
We've got to protect our
phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen.

242
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:54,155
We must do something about this
immediately, immediately, immediately!

243
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:58,511
I didn't get a "hrumph" out of that guy!

244
00:19:58,834 --> 00:19:59,946
Give the governor a "hrumph."

245
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,121
You watch your ass.

246
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:04,593
Gentlemen, please, rest your sphincters.

247
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:05,710
Well put.

248
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,906
As Attorney General, I can assure you...

249
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,551
...that a suitable sheriff will be found
to restore the peace in Rock Ridge.

250
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,158
Meeting is adjourned.

251
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,710
Oh, I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean
to overstep my bounds. You say that.

252
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:18,665
What?

253
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:19,789
- Meeting is adjourned.
- It is?

254
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:21,741
No. You say that, governor.

255
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,341
- What?
- Meeting is adjourned.

256
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:24,041
It is?

257
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:27,142
Here, play around with this for a while.
They are sweeping the country.

258
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,218
Why don't you give these out
to some of the boys...

259
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,171
...in lieu of pay? Here you go.

260
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,901
And one for Miss Stein,
my beloved secretary.

261
00:20:37,232 --> 00:20:40,199
Play with these, boys,
in lieu of the other things.

262
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,141
This friggin' thing is warped.

263
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:46,925
Why do I always get a warped one?

264
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:54,190
A sheriff! But law and order
is the last thing I want.

265
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:00,360
Wait a minute. Maybe I could
turn this thing to my advantage.

266
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:05,799
If I could find a sheriff who so
offends the citizens of Rock Ridge...

267
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:09,060
...that his very appearance
would drive them out of town...

268
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:13,223
But where would I find such a man?

269
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,783
Why am I asking you?

270
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:29,031
Welcome to Hanging House.
Not to worry...

271
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,590
...everyone is equal in my eye.

272
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,533
Oh, not my ear!

273
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,274
Governor!

274
00:21:57,612 --> 00:21:58,757
Official business, sir.

275
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,228
Is it important?

276
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:01,960
It's very crucial.

277
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:04,192
Be with you in a minute.

278
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:06,977
Throw something on
and stay in that position.

279
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:13,312
Forgive me, I was just, ah, walking
the parapet, taking a look around.

280
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:14,472
What can I do for you?

281
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:16,071
Governor, as per your instructions...

282
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:18,724
...I'd like you to meet
the new sheriff of Rock Ridge.

283
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:20,864
I'd be delighted... Wow!

284
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:24,106
I've got to talk to you. Come here.
Have you gone berserk?

285
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,723
Can't you see that man is a nig...

286
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:33,029
Wrong person. Forgive me.
No offense intended.

287
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:37,927
Have you gone berserk?
Can't you see that man is a nig?

288
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,654
Don't worry, sir.

289
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,146
Now, Hedley, I've always
trusted your judgment before...

290
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:44,356
...but haven't you taken a giant leap
away from your good senses?

291
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,661
Please, don't fly off the handle, sir.

292
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:49,062
I'm about to make you
an historic figure.

293
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,229
Maybe even get you a cabinet post.

294
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:53,698
A cabinet post!

295
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:55,142
Did you say that?

296
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:56,741
Wonderful!

297
00:22:57,064 --> 00:23:01,090
Yes, the first man ever to appoint
a black sheriff! Just think, sir...

298
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:02,690
...Washington, Jefferson...

299
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:03,616
...Lincoln.

300
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:04,992
Le Petomane!

301
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:08,195
Sir, you have the seeds
of greatness in you.

302
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,462
Nurse them, caress them,
pour water on them.

303
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:14,046
Don't short-change yourself, sir.

304
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,793
It will never work.
They'll kill him dead in one day!

305
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,179
One day is all we'll need to secure your
name in the annals of Western history.

306
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:24,959
And to get for you
a nomination for, dare I say?

307
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:26,147
Dare, dare!

308
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,453
The Presidency!

309
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:30,788
Hail to the Chief!
Hail to the Chief!

310
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:41,311
"Four score and seven years ago...

311
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:44,638
"...our forefathers
brought forth on this..."

312
00:23:45,062 --> 00:23:46,010
Are you coming back?

313
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,138
In a moment, dear.

314
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:52,351
Gentlemen, affairs of state must take
precedent over the affairs of state.

315
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:54,500
Yes, of course, sir, we understand.

316
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:56,253
Will you make all the arrangements?

317
00:23:56,581 --> 00:23:57,858
I will make all the arrangements.

318
00:23:58,118 --> 00:23:59,459
Especially the funeral.

319
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:05,345
Good luck, good luck, boys.
Wonderful working with you. Good luck!

320
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:10,811
Hurry up, get those flags up.
He'll be here soon.

321
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,464
I just got a telegram from
the governor's office.

322
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,315
The sheriff will be here at noon!

323
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:20,374
Noon! I'd better rehearse my speech!

324
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:25,565
"As Honorary Chairman of
the Welcoming Committee...

325
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:30,361
"...it is my privilege to extend to you
a laurel and hearty handshake!"

326
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:32,987
Wonderful!

327
00:25:33,313 --> 00:25:34,109
Excellent!

328
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:36,349
Can you see him yet?

329
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:42,357
The sheriff is coming!

330
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:45,784

The sheriff is near!

00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:37,846
"...of the Office of Sheriff in and for
the Township of Rock Ridge."

343
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:41,362
Gentlemen, let us not allow anger
to rule the day.

344
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:44,207
As your spiritual leader,
I implore you...

345
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,807
...to pay heed to this good
book and what it has to say.

346
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:52,725
Son, you're on your own!

347
00:27:57,497 --> 00:27:58,196
Hold it!

348
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:01,554
The next man makes a move,
the nigger gets it!

349
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,562
Hold it, men. He's not bluffing.

350
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,639
Listen to him, men.
He's just crazy enough to do it.

351
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:15,190
Drop it! Or I swear I'll blow this
nigger's head all over this town!

352
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:21,299
Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate!
Do what he say! Do what he say!

353
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:40,270
Isn't anybody going to
help that poor man?

354
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:43,116
Hush, Harriet. That's a
sure way to get him killed.

355
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,902
Help me, help me...

356
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,468
...somebody help me!

357
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,662
Shut up!

358
00:28:55,894 --> 00:29:00,204
Oh, baby, you are so talented.

359
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:02,799
And they are so dumb!

360
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:11,914
Goddamn it!

361
00:29:12,246 --> 00:29:13,424
I said, "Order"!

362
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,182
You know, Nietzsche says,
"Out of chaos comes order."

363
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:21,391
Oh, blow it out your ass, Howard!

364
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:26,123
Now everyone be quiet...

365
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:31,437
...whilst we listen to Harriet van
Johnson, our esteemed schoolmarm...

366
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:37,677
...as she reads a telegram that she
herself has composed to the governor...

367
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:43,725
...expressing our feelings
about the new sheriff.

368
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:53,385
"To the Honorable William J.
Le Petomane, Governor."

369
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:55,145
Louder! Speak up! We can't hear you!

370
00:29:57,108 --> 00:29:58,863
I'm not used to public speaking.

371
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:05,548
"We, the white, God-fearing
citizens of Rock Ridge...

372
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:10,544
"...wish to express
our extreme displeasure...

373
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:12,776
"...with your choice of sheriff.

374
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:16,241
"Please remove him immediately.

375
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,646
"The fact that you
have sent him here..."

376
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,923
"...just goes to prove that you are
the leading asshole in the state."

377
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:52,559
The drunk in number two must be awake.

378
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,438
Are we awake?

379
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,221
We're not sure.

380
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:08,811
Are we black?

381
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,148
Yes, we are.

382
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:16,072
Then we're awake.
But we're very puzzled.

383
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:20,683
I think I better straighten myself out.

384
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,126
Need any help?

385
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,579
All I can get.

386
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,397
That's okay. Sit down over here.

387
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:56,098
Hey, maybe you should
eat something first.

388
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:59,304
No, thanks. Food makes me sick.

389
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:12,648
A man drinks like that and doesn't eat,
he is going to die.

390
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:16,007
When?

391
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:20,072
What's your name?

392
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,067
Well, my name is Jim,
but most people call me...

393
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:27,718
...Jim.

394
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:34,058
Okay, Jim, since you are my
guest and I am your host...

395
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:37,030
...what is your pleasure?
What do you like to do?

396
00:32:37,803 --> 00:32:40,356
Oh, I don't know. Play chess...

397
00:32:42,347 --> 00:32:43,361
...screw.

398
00:32:44,683 --> 00:32:45,959
Well, let's play chess.

399
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,565
Checkmate.

400
00:32:53,578 --> 00:32:54,309
Checkmate.

401
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:57,289
Why, you devious son-of-a-bitch!

402
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,202
Happy days!

403
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,276
Man, why do you do that to yourself?

404
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:13,634
Oh, you don't really want to know that.

405
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:15,046
I do, I do!

406
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,088
Well, if you must pry.

407
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:18,528
I must, I must!

408
00:33:20,072 --> 00:33:22,625
I don't know if you ever
heard of me before, but...

409
00:33:23,497 --> 00:33:27,523
...I used to be called the Waco Kid.

410
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:32,610
The Waco Kid. He had the
fastest hands in the West!

411
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,490
In the world!

412
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:38,624
Well, if you're the Kid,
then show me something.

413
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:44,802
Maybe a couple of years ago I could
have shown you something, but today...

414
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,287
...look at that.

415
00:33:48,647 --> 00:33:49,891
Steady as a rock.

416
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:52,479
Yes, but I shoot with this hand.

417
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:57,472
See, I knew you weren't the Waco Kid.
You were just pulling my lariat.

418
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,891
See that king?

419
00:34:15,622 --> 00:34:17,444
Put your hands on both sides of it.

420
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:24,635
Now when I say, "go,"
you try to grab it first.

421
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:28,292
Man, that's no contest.
You're a mile away.

422
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:36,634
Anyway, when you hear the word
"go," you just try to grab it.

423
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:38,620
Ready?

424
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,096
You looking for this?

425
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,863
Well, raise my rent!
You are the Kid!

426
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:12,089
Was. Yeah, I was the Kid.

427
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:15,808
What happened?

428
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:19,455
Well, it got so that every
piss-ant prairie punk...

429
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:21,661
...who thought he could
shoot a gun...

430
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,640
...would ride into town
to try out the Waco Kid.

431
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,622
I must have killed more men
than Cecil B. DeMille.

432
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,180
It got pretty gritty.

433
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:36,570
I started to hear the
word "draw" in my sleep.

434
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:40,408
Then one day...

435
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:45,818
...I was just walking down the street
and I heard a voice behind me say...

436
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:51,323
..."Reach for it, mister!"
I spun around.

437
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:55,898
And there I was face to face...

438
00:35:58,272 --> 00:36:00,825
...with a 6-year-old kid!

439
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:08,317
Well, I just threw my guns
down and walked away.

440
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:14,172
The little bastard shot me in the ass!

441
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:21,399
So I limped to the nearest saloon,
crawled inside a whiskey bottle...

442
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:25,529
...and I've been there ever since.

443
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:30,682
Have a drink.

444
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:42,039
Anyway, that's all ancient history.
Now you tell me your story.

445
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:46,490
What's a dazzling urbanite like you
doing in a rustic setting like this?

446
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:49,018
If you really must pry.

447
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:51,444
I must, I must!

448
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:58,647
Well, back in '56...

449
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:02,614
...my folks and I were part
of this long wagon train...

450
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:04,114
...moving West.

451
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:19,289
Well, not exactly part of it.

452
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,148
You might say we were bringing up
the rear, when suddenly,

453
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,955
...from out of the West,
came the entire Sioux Nation!

454
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:32,059
And let me tell you, baby,
they were open for business!

455
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:39,640
Naturally, the white folks
didn't let us travel in their circle...

456
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,106
...so we made our own.

457
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:17,656
Shvartzes?

458
00:38:25,497 --> 00:38:28,147
Luzem gayen!

459
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,484
Cop a walk. It's all right.

460
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:35,509
Thank you.

461
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,667
Abi gezunt. Take off.

462
00:38:47,896 --> 00:38:50,067
They're darker than us!

463
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,602
And the rest is history.

464
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:58,479
Impressed?

465
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,517
Always like to keep my audience riveted.

466
00:39:58,228 --> 00:39:59,723
How about some more beans,
Mr. Taggart?

467
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:01,743
I'd say you've had enough!

468
00:40:05,556 --> 00:40:09,647
I understand there's a new sheriff
in town. Who wants to kill him?

469
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:19,313
Why don't we give him to Mongo?

470
00:40:23,027 --> 00:40:24,936
Holy shit, that's too cruel!

471
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:29,036
I'll be danged! That is a unique idea!

472
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:39,248
Down, boy, down, boy,
down, Mongo!

473
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:41,098
Hey, it's me. Taggart.

474
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:43,179
Here, smell. Smell.

475
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:48,717
That's a good Mongo.

476
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:53,896
Hey, how about it? How would you
like to mutilate that new sheriff?

477
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:00,297
Have a cigar.

478
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:41,542
Oh, by the way,
I got a note this morning.

479
00:41:41,903 --> 00:41:42,699
From who?

480
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:47,016
Well, I'm not sure.
It was addressed to the Deputy Spade.

481
00:41:51,118 --> 00:41:53,835
Well, once I establish
myself in this town...

482
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:57,354
...Deputy Spade might turn
out to be a groovy position.

483
00:42:07,085 --> 00:42:09,987
Listen, Bart,
I want you to do me a favor.

484
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:13,036
I don't want you going
out there this morning.

485
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,561
You can't win these people
over, no matter what you do.

486
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:17,412
They're just not going to accept you.

487
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,530
I'm glad those fingers ain't loaded!

488
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,620
Just like old times.

489
00:42:39,756 --> 00:42:44,229
Like I told you, once you establish
yourself, they've got to accept you.

490
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:46,624
Catch you later.

491
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,133
Good luck.

492
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:01,376
Ah, good morning, ma'am.

493
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:05,088
And isn't it a lovely morning?

494
00:43:05,898 --> 00:43:07,272
Up yours, nigger!

495
00:43:11,754 --> 00:43:14,688
What did you expect?
"Welcome, sonny."

496
00:43:15,914 --> 00:43:17,256
"Make yourself at home."

497
00:43:18,698 --> 00:43:23,171
"Marry my daughter." You've got to
remember these are just simple farmers.

498
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:26,694
These are people of the land.

499
00:43:27,658 --> 00:43:30,756
The common clay of the new West.

500
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:33,407
You know.

501
00:43:35,497 --> 00:43:36,445
Morons!

502
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,022
What the hell is that?

503
00:43:56,776 --> 00:43:59,645
Mongo! Santa María!

504
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,782
I believe in it.
And if any one of you...

505
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:05,470
...friends and neighbors,
kind of gather around and...

506
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:07,910
Holy shit!

507
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:17,378
And they say that now in Paris,
France, even as we speak...

508
00:44:18,342 --> 00:44:21,539
...Louis Pasteur has devised
a new vaccine...

509
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:24,420
...that will obliterate anthrax
once and for all.

510
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,259
Hey, you can't park
that animal over there!

511
00:44:32,614 --> 00:44:33,661
It's illegal.

512
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:45,403
Think of it, gentlemen. Hoof-and-
mouth disease a thing of the past!

513
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:49,476
Never mind that shit,
here comes Mongo!

514
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:56,769
I don't know what it is.

515
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,507
Sheriff, Mongo's back!
He's breaking up the whole town!

516
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:07,395
You've got to help us, please!

517
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,664
Did you hear that? Now it's "please."

518
00:45:09,988 --> 00:45:14,265
This morning I couldn't get the time
of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?

519
00:45:14,596 --> 00:45:17,498
Well, Mongo ain't exactly a "who."
He's more of a "what."

520
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:18,817
What he said.

521
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,187
Well, I don't know...

522
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:22,943
Oh, thank you very much!

523
00:45:25,091 --> 00:45:26,269
The fool's going to...

524
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:28,994
I mean, the sheriff's going to do it.

525
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:38,846
No, no, don't do that! If you shoot
him, you'll just make him mad.

526
00:45:49,826 --> 00:45:51,103
Candygram for Mongo!

527
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:04,506
Me, Mongo.

528
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,042
Sign, please.

529
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:18,105
Mongo like candy.

530
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,902
A little further down, to the right.

531
00:46:27,648 --> 00:46:30,103
I thought sure that Mongo
would mash him up...

532
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:32,085
...into little bitty sheriff meatballs.

533
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:34,110
I just don't understand it.

534
00:46:34,432 --> 00:46:35,544
Be still, Taggart.

535
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,064
My mind is a raging torrent...

536
00:46:39,392 --> 00:46:41,214
...flooded with rivulets of thought...

537
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:44,508
...cascading into a waterfall
of creative alternatives.

538
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,798
Gol darn it, Mr. Lamarr...

539
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:51,420
...you use your tongue prettier
than a $20 whore.

540
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:59,031
Wait a minute, that's it!

541
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:02,330
And it will work!

542
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:05,076
You bet it will! What will work?

543
00:47:05,502 --> 00:47:06,931
Elementary, cactus-head!

544
00:47:07,262 --> 00:47:08,538
The beast has failed.

545
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,419
And when the beast fails,
it's time to call in beauty.

546
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,262
Beauty?

547
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:19,704
She's never failed me before.
She'll turn him into jelly!

548
00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:21,938
She'll bring him to his knees!

549
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:27,196
Where's my froggie?
Where's my froggie?

550
00:47:27,517 --> 00:47:29,557
I don't know.
I didn't see it when I came in.

551
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:31,346
Damn your eyes, look for it!

552
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:39,994
Oh, there it is.

553
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:50,039
That was a close one! Daddy loves
Froggie. Froggie love Daddy?

554
00:47:59,803 --> 00:48:01,297
I don't know how you did it.

555
00:48:01,787 --> 00:48:03,031
He was nothing.

556
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:05,777
The bitch was inventing
the candygram.

557
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:08,239
They probably won't give me
credit for it.

558
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:18,585
Good evening, sheriff.

559
00:48:18,906 --> 00:48:21,241
Sorry about the "Up yours, nigger."

560
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,142
I hope this apple pie will in some
small way say thank you for your...

561
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:28,979
...ingenuity and courage in
defeating that horrible Mongo.

562
00:48:29,466 --> 00:48:31,855
Thank you. Much obliged.
Good night.

563
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:45,519
Of course, you'll have the good taste
not to mention that I spoke to you.

564
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:55,064
I'm rapidly becoming a big
underground success in this town.

565
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:59,061
See, in another 25 years you'll be able
to shake their hands in broad daylight.

566
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,783
Well, I'm not going to
hold my breath for it.

567
00:49:02,136 --> 00:49:06,358
Come on, I don't want to be late.
Lili von Shtupp is opening tonight.

568
00:49:07,064 --> 00:49:08,340
Lili von who?

569
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:26,511
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome.
Come on in.

570
00:49:31,383 --> 00:49:33,717
It's Hedley. For you, my dear.

571
00:49:35,094 --> 00:49:37,909
Oh, how ordinary.

572
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,339
Oh, Lili, Lili, Lili, legs, Lili, Lili!

573
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:48,811
I can't find the words to
truly express my joy...

574
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:50,989
...at the rekindling of our association.

575
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:54,254
Bullshit, what's the job?

576
00:49:56,501 --> 00:49:58,094
I love it when you talk dirty.

577
00:50:10,196 --> 00:50:12,880
Come on, Lamarr, let's get down to
bwass tacks.

578
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:15,085
What do you want me to do?

579
00:50:16,628 --> 00:50:20,370
I want you to seduce and abandon
the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

580
00:50:20,948 --> 00:50:22,060
You think you can do it?

581
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:26,098
Is Bismark a hewwing?

582
00:50:26,452 --> 00:50:29,452
Oh, Lili, you're magnificent! Kiss me!

583
00:50:41,203 --> 00:50:45,578
And now, folks, the gal
you've all been waiting for...

584
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:50,509
...the Bavarian Bombshell herself!
Let's hear it for Lili von Shtupp!

585
00:51:03,058 --> 00:51:06,254
"Here I stand, the goddess of desire...

586
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:10,672
"...set men on fire.
I have this power.

587
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:15,718
"Morning, noon and night,
it's drink and dancing...

588
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:20,682
"...some quick romancing,
and then a shower.

589
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:25,126
"Stage door Johnnies

590
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,806
"...they always hound
me with one request.

00:51:30,832 --> 00:51:33,799
"Who can satisfy their lustful habit?

592
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:39,145
"I'm not a rabbit. I need some rest.

593
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:48,294
"I'm tired...

594
00:51:49,712 --> 00:51:52,778
"...sick and tired of love...

00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,805
"I've had my fill of love...

596

"Let's face it, I'm tired.

"I've been with thousands
of men again and again.

601

"They promise the moon.

"They're always coming and
going and going and coming...

00:52:35,438 --> 00:52:37,347
"...and always too soon."

604
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:39,530
Right, girls?

605
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:44,421
"I'm tired.
Tired of playing the game.

606
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:49,832
"Ain't it a crying shame?

607
00:52:50,893 --> 00:52:53,762
"I'm so tired."

608
00:52:54,444 --> 00:52:56,648
Goddamn it, I'm exhausted!

609
00:52:58,828 --> 00:53:01,130
Hello, cowboy, what's your name?

610
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:05,001
"Tex ma'am"? Tell me, Tex ma'am...

611
00:53:05,324 --> 00:53:06,698
...are you in show business?

612
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:07,651
Nope.

613
00:53:07,883 --> 00:53:10,730
Well, then, why don't you get your
friggin' feet off the stage?

614
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:28,516
Hello, handsome. Is that a 10-gallon
hat, or are you just enjoying the show?

615
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,945
Oh, Miss Lili, oh, my lovely lady!

a little bit more comfortable?

Bitte, baby.

He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands.
By morning he will be my slave.

Splendid.

652
00:57:19,423 --> 00:57:20,852
Oh, just let me have a little feel.

653
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:24,377
Where were we? Where are you?

654
00:57:26,398 --> 00:57:28,471
Let me sit down next to you.

655
00:57:30,878 --> 00:57:32,154
Tell me, schatzie...

Oh, it's twu, it's twu!

658
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:50,708
Vill you care for
another schnitzengruben?

659
00:57:51,037 --> 00:57:54,931
No, thank you. Fifteen is my
limit on schnitzengruben.

660
00:57:55,741 --> 00:57:58,228
Well, then, how about a little?

661
00:58:01,596 --> 00:58:04,793
Baby, please, I am not from Havana.

662
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:06,969
Excuse me, honey...

663
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:11,032
...besides, I'm late for work.
I've got some heavy chores to do.

664
00:58:11,612 --> 00:58:14,165
Vill I, vill I see you later?

665
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:19,224
That all depends on how much
Vitamin E I can get my hands on.

666
00:58:19,515 --> 00:58:20,693
Nein, nein, achtung!

667
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:24,053
No, no, you mustn't go! I need you!

668
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:27,088
I never met nobody like you!
I can't live without you!

669
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:33,648
Please, you're making
a German spectacle of yourself.

670
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:37,652
Auf wiedersehen, baby.

671
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:46,609
Oh, what a nice guy.

672
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:57,654
Oh, deary, dear.
Look what the cat dragged in.

673
00:59:10,392 --> 00:59:12,148
What's happening in the clean world?

674
00:59:12,985 --> 00:59:13,912
Bad news.

675
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:18,774
I've got a writ here for Mongo's
release signed by Hedley Lamarr himself.

676
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,546
Why would a dude like
Hedley Lamarr care about Mongo?

677
00:59:29,496 --> 00:59:30,292
It's legal.

678
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:36,309
Oh, those schnitzengrubens
can wipe you out!

679
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:44,819
Wake up time!

680
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:53,423
Okay, Mongo. You're free to go.

681
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:56,077
Mongo no go.

682
00:59:58,806 --> 01:00:02,155
Oh, come on, Mongo.
You're a free man.

683
01:00:03,894 --> 01:00:08,366
Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart.
Sheriff first man ever whip Mongo.

684
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:13,844
Mongo impressed, have deep
feelings for Sheriff Bart.

685
01:00:15,925 --> 01:00:17,998
Oh, you better watch out, big fella.

686
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:21,167
I think Mongo's taken
a little fancy to you.

687
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:26,606
Mongo straight.

688
01:00:31,284 --> 01:00:33,488
Maybe you know why a high-roller...

689
01:00:33,556 --> 01:00:35,760
...like Hedley Lamarr is interested
in Rock Ridge.

690
01:00:36,565 --> 01:00:40,623
Don't know. Got to do
with where choo-choo go.

691
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:47,883
Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care
about where the choo-choo goes?

692
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:49,899
Don't know.

693
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:55,758
Mongo only pawn in game of life.

694
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:00,840
I think this might be a good time
to mosey out...

695
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:03,248
...to where they're building
the railroad...

696
01:01:03,507 --> 01:01:05,100
...and maybe do a little snooping.

697
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,095
Damn, damn, damn!

698
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,474
Hey, how are you doing Bart?
Get down off that horse!

699
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:03,184
Oh, you shifty nigger!
They said you were hung!

700
01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:04,518
And they were right!

701
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:07,662
Look at that star, hoo-ee!
Civil service!

702
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:12,677
Wait. Back off, scamp.

703
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:15,717
You are addressing the duly appointed
sheriff of Rock Ridge.

704
01:02:16,623 --> 01:02:19,372
Rock Ridge? Hey, the railroad
is going through there!

705
01:02:34,734 --> 01:02:37,996
Back up off your brother!
Don't mess up your brother!

706
01:02:54,862 --> 01:02:56,618
Holy mother of pearl!

707
01:02:57,453 --> 01:03:00,355
It's that nigger that hit me
on the head with the shovel!

708
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:04,362
Now what the hell do you think you're
doing with that tin star, boy?

709
01:03:04,685 --> 01:03:09,157
Watch that "boy" shit, redneck! You're
talking to the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

710
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:13,123
Well, now if that don't beat all!

711
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:16,136
Here we take the good time
and trouble...

712
01:03:16,204 --> 01:03:18,440
...to slaughter every last Indian
in the West, and for what?

713
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:24,133
So they can appoint a sheriff
that's blacker than any Indian!

714
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,601
I am depressed.

715
01:03:27,051 --> 01:03:30,313
Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir, but I
sure do hate to see you like this.

716
01:03:30,635 --> 01:03:33,155
What if me and the boys were to
shoot that nigger dead?

717
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,234
Would that pep you up some?

718
01:03:35,276 --> 01:03:36,323
Well, it might help.

719
01:03:36,715 --> 01:03:39,268
All right, boys. On the count of three.

720
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:42,216
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

721
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,676
Don't pay no attention to that alky.

722
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:47,079
He can't even hold a gun,
much less shoot it.

723
01:03:50,123 --> 01:03:51,813
Like I said. On the count of three.

724
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:54,755
One...

725
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:57,602
...two...

726
01:03:58,442 --> 01:03:59,074
...three!

727
01:04:10,377 --> 01:04:14,850
Well, just don't sit there looking
stupid, grasping your hands in pain.

728
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:19,072
How about a little applause
for the Waco Kid?

729
01:04:29,737 --> 01:04:32,387
All right, I'm through being
Mr. Goodbar!

730
01:04:32,456 --> 01:04:35,140
The time has come to act
and act quickly!

731
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:36,548
All my plans have backfired!

732
01:04:36,648 --> 01:04:38,884
Instead of the people leaving,
they're staying in droves!

733
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:43,069
Vhy don't you admit it?
He's too much of man for you. I know.

734
01:04:43,432 --> 01:04:45,188
You going to need an army to beat him!

735
01:04:45,735 --> 01:04:47,164
You're finished.

736
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:51,968
Fertig! Fahrblunged! Fahrcocked!

737
01:04:58,183 --> 01:05:00,736
Shut up! You Teutonic twat!

738
01:05:02,086 --> 01:05:03,712
I must think.

739
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:16,066
Wait a minute. She said army.
Of course!

740
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:21,118
An army of the worst dregs ever
to soil the face of the West!

741
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:28,802
I've decided to launch an attack that
will reduce Rock Ridge to ashes!

742
01:05:29,445 --> 01:05:30,722
What do you want me to do, sir?

743
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:34,337
I want you to round up every vicious
criminal and gunslinger in the West.

744
01:05:34,437 --> 01:05:35,385
Take this down.

745
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:40,771
I want rustlers, cutthroats,
murderers, bounty hunters...

746
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:45,183
...desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs,
nitwits, half-wits, dimwits...

747
01:05:45,477 --> 01:05:49,884
...vipers, snipers, con men,
Indian agents, Mexican bandits...

748
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:53,343
...muggers, buggerers,
bushwackers, hornswagglers...

749
01:05:53,636 --> 01:05:57,345
...horse thieves, bull dykes, train
robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers...

750
01:05:57,476 --> 01:05:59,777
...shit kickers and Methodists!

751
01:06:02,244 --> 01:06:04,000
Could you repeat that, sir?

752
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:14,688
Where's everybody going?

753
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:17,341
Read this.

754
01:06:27,618 --> 01:06:31,033
Well, can't you see that's the
last act of a desperate man?

755
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,123
We don't care if it's the First Act of
Henry the Fifth! We're leaving!

756
01:06:37,186 --> 01:06:40,601
Now, wait a minute!
Wait just one doggoned minute!

757
01:06:41,825 --> 01:06:46,298
Just give me 24 hours to come up
with a brilliant idea to save our town.

758
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:49,599
Just 24 hours, that's all I ask.

759
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:51,128
No!

760
01:06:52,161 --> 01:06:54,016
You'd do it for Randolph Scott.

761
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:02,271
All right, sheriff. 24 hours.

762
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:01,015
Next!

763
01:08:02,494 --> 01:08:03,421
Qualifications?

764
01:08:03,933 --> 01:08:06,104
Rape, murder, arson and rape.

765
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:08,025
You said rape twice.

766
01:08:08,925 --> 01:08:09,873
I like rape.

767
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:14,843
Charming. Sign right here.

768
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:17,529
Take that badge.

769
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:22,362
Qualifications?

770
01:08:23,036 --> 01:08:26,036
Arson, armed robbery, mayhem.

771
01:08:26,397 --> 01:08:29,745
Wait a moment. What have
you got in your mouth?

772
01:08:32,732 --> 01:08:34,837
Nothing, eh? Lyle.

773
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:38,710
Gum!

774
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,875
Chewing gum on line, eh?

775
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,983
I hope you brought enough
for everybody.

776
01:08:46,811 --> 01:08:48,567
I didn't know there was
going to be so many.

777
01:08:53,883 --> 01:08:55,793
Boy, is he strict!

778
01:08:56,283 --> 01:08:58,901
We've got to get in there close
and find out what's happening.

779
01:09:00,699 --> 01:09:01,779
There's our ticket!

780
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:09,809
Hey, boys!

781
01:09:11,386 --> 01:09:12,760
Look what I've got there!

782
01:09:14,842 --> 01:09:16,565
Hey, where are the white women at?

783
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:32,244
Man, that was pretty! I liked that.

784
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:37,013
Be ready to attack Rock Ridge at
noon tomorrow. Here's your badge.

785
01:09:40,665 --> 01:09:43,348
We don't need no stinkin' badges!

786
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,032
Next!

787
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,476
Qualifications?

788
01:09:48,216 --> 01:09:49,557
Stampeding cattle.

789
01:09:50,008 --> 01:09:51,437
That's not much of a crime.

790
01:09:51,768 --> 01:09:53,044
Through the Vatican!

791
01:09:53,528 --> 01:09:54,476
Kinky!

792
01:09:57,719 --> 01:09:59,923
Why, Rhett, how many times
have I told you...

793
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:02,195
...to wash up after
weekly cross-burning?

794
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:03,887
See, it's coming off.

795
01:10:06,455 --> 01:10:09,804
And now, for my next impression,
Jesse Owens!

796
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:12,721
Catch them!

797
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:17,877
Hold up, men,
we'll head them off at the pass!

798
01:10:19,126 --> 01:10:23,282
Head them off at the pass?
I hate that cliché!

799
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:42,028
Say, "hello."

800
01:10:42,517 --> 01:10:43,248
Hello.

801
01:10:44,277 --> 01:10:46,100
Listen to me, and listen to me good.

802
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:48,465
I want you to get
all the brothers together...

803
01:10:48,789 --> 01:10:52,585
...round up all the lumber, canvas, paint
and nails you can lay your hands on...

804
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:57,390
...and meet me tonight 3 miles
due east of Rock Ridge at midnight.

805
01:10:58,165 --> 01:10:58,895
You understand?

806
01:10:59,572 --> 01:11:00,401
Say, "goodbye."

807
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:03,277
Thanks a lot, brother.

808
01:11:31,122 --> 01:11:34,089
All right, folks, I know you're a bit
confused wondering what you're doing...

809
01:11:34,162 --> 01:11:36,301
...out in the middle of the prairie
in the middle of the night.

810
01:11:36,434 --> 01:11:37,514
You bet your ass!

811
01:11:38,706 --> 01:11:39,633
I'm hip.

812
01:11:40,274 --> 01:11:41,801
Now, before the sun comes up...

813
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:47,629
...we're going to build on this sight an
exact replica of the town of Rock Ridge.

814
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:53,863
Every building, every storefront,
every rock and every tree...

815
01:11:54,194 --> 01:11:57,455
...right down to the orange roof
on Howard Johnson's outhouse.

816
01:11:58,993 --> 01:11:59,942
I get it!

817
01:12:00,273 --> 01:12:02,891
And tomorrow when Hedley Lamarr
and his men come riding in...

818
01:12:03,025 --> 01:12:04,170
...to destroy the real Rock Ridge...

819
01:12:04,305 --> 01:12:06,215
...they'll actually be destroying
the fake Rock Ridge!

820
01:12:06,289 --> 01:12:08,623
But they'll think
it's the real Rock Ridge!

821
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:10,511
But we'll know it's the fake Rock Ridge!

822
01:12:10,832 --> 01:12:14,029
How're we going to do it? We don't
have the time nor the people.

823
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:16,524
Wrong! There's why.

824
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,102
Who the hell are they?

825
01:12:24,816 --> 01:12:29,323
Railroad workers. They've agreed
to help us make our dream come true.

826
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:32,175
And all they ask in return
is a little plot of land...

827
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:34,212
...they can call their own to homestead.

828
01:12:34,543 --> 01:12:35,623
What do you say?

829
01:12:42,767 --> 01:12:46,149
We'll give some land to the niggers
and the chinks...

830
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:48,872
...but we don't want the Irish!

831
01:12:54,094 --> 01:12:55,141
No deal.

832
01:12:56,143 --> 01:12:59,558
Ah, prairie shit! Everybody!

833
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:05,102
Oh, Lord...

834
01:13:06,286 --> 01:13:10,759
...do we have the strength to carry on
this mighty task in one night?

835
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,626
Or are we just jerking off?

836
01:13:25,933 --> 01:13:30,406
Okay, okay, we have done it.
Now, let's see what we have done.

837
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:13,507
Men, you are about to embark
on a great crusade...

838
01:14:14,474 --> 01:14:16,863
...to stamp out runaway
decency in the West.

839
01:14:17,546 --> 01:14:19,684
Now you will only
be risking your lives...

840
01:14:20,106 --> 01:14:24,481
...whilst I will be risking an almost
certain Academy Award nomination...

841
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:26,984
...for Best Supporting Actor.

842
01:14:27,849 --> 01:14:29,758
Now raise your right
hand for the pledge.

843
01:14:32,105 --> 01:14:32,966
Right!

844
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:37,380
And repeat after me. I...

845
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:39,848
...your name...

846
01:14:40,201 --> 01:14:41,445
...your name...

847
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:44,703
Schmucks!
...pledge allegiance...

848
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:46,309
...pledge allegiance...

849
01:14:46,665 --> 01:14:48,159
...to Hedley Lamarr...

850
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:49,983
...to Hedy Lamarr...

851
01:14:50,313 --> 01:14:51,261
That's Hedley!

852
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:52,737
...that's Hedley...

853
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,720
...and to the evil...

854
01:14:55,048 --> 01:14:56,477
...and to the evil...

855
01:14:56,808 --> 01:14:58,401
...for which he stands!

856
01:14:58,728 --> 01:15:00,069
...for which he stands!

857
01:15:00,424 --> 01:15:04,897
Now go do that voodoo
that you do so well!

858
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,162
Hold the happiness. We are in trouble.

859
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:23,877
Yep! We forgot one little detail.

860
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:27,681
Nothing is missing. Everything is here,
down to the last hitching post.

861
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:30,302
People. There are no people.

862
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:32,965
Now don't panic. Don't panic.

863
01:15:33,702 --> 01:15:36,385
We just made a perfect copy
of Rock Ridge.

864
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:39,994
Now all we've got to do is make
perfect copies of ourselves.

865
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:43,358
But they'll be here in half an hour.

866
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:45,758
Right, so we've got to
start working fast.

867
01:15:46,117 --> 01:15:49,695
You men start working on the dummies.
Jim and Mongo, come with me.

868
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:53,758
I've got an idea that will
slow them down to a crawl.

869
01:15:54,085 --> 01:15:54,947
All right, let's go!

870
01:16:02,821 --> 01:16:04,730
Yeah, that's nice.

871
01:16:25,987 --> 01:16:30,460
Le Petomane Thruway! Now what
will that asshole think of next?

872
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,872
Has anybody got a dime?

873
01:16:36,515 --> 01:16:39,548
Somebody's got to go back
and get a shit-load of dimes.

874
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:52,161
Hurry up. Speed it up or we're
never going to get to Rock Ridge!

875
01:16:52,706 --> 01:16:55,356
Come on, move them through!

876
01:17:01,345 --> 01:17:03,200
Well, they're through the tollbooth.

877
01:17:05,601 --> 01:17:07,990
Look at this, they're buying it!

878
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,216
All right, here we go.
Hold your ears, folks!

879
01:17:21,664 --> 01:17:23,191
It's show time!

880
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:28,540
Nothing!

881
01:17:28,864 --> 01:17:30,075
What are we going to do?

882
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:33,659
Any minute now they're going to discover
the town is fake and pull out!

883
01:17:36,064 --> 01:17:38,485
You think you could squeeze off
a little shot from here...

884
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,469
...and set off the dynamite down there?

885
01:17:41,536 --> 01:17:42,812
I'll give it a try.

886
01:17:53,022 --> 01:17:56,219
Oh, Lord, keep this man's eye keen...

887
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:58,388
...and may God grant...

888
01:18:10,078 --> 01:18:11,256
It's a fake!

889
01:18:11,582 --> 01:18:13,109
We've been suckered in!

890
01:18:29,597 --> 01:18:32,893
Okay, folks, let's wipe them out!

891
01:18:56,476 --> 01:18:57,850
Forgive me, Lord!

892
01:19:58,424 --> 01:20:00,333
"Throw out your hands,
stick out your tush.

893
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:02,318
"Hands on your hips,
give them a push.

894
01:20:02,616 --> 01:20:05,812
"You'll be surprised, you're doing
the French Mistake. Voilà!"

895
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:09,652
All right, cut!

896
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:15,500
Wrong!

897
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:21,899
Just watch me. It's so simple!

898
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:23,507
You sissy Marys!

899
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:28,341
Give me the playback.
And watch me, faggots!

900
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:42,068
Have you got it?

901
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:43,568
Yessssssss.

902
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:46,127
Sounds like steam escaping!

903
01:20:46,646 --> 01:20:49,679
Action! Okay, wait until I get out.

904
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:22,963
Cut! What in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

905
01:21:23,284 --> 01:21:25,106
This is a closed set!

906
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,684
Piss on you!
I'm working for Mel Brooks.

907
01:21:29,011 --> 01:21:30,866
Not in the face!

908
01:21:32,724 --> 01:21:33,617
Thank you.

909
01:21:34,131 --> 01:21:36,979
They've hit Buddy!
Come on, girls!

910
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,883
You vulgar shit!

911
01:21:48,307 --> 01:21:50,860
Why, you miserable pansy!

912
01:21:55,379 --> 01:21:56,939
I'm parked over by the commissary.

913
01:22:01,618 --> 01:22:04,967
You brute, you brute,
you vicious brute!

914
01:22:06,642 --> 01:22:08,551
All right, all right...

915
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:24,490
How many days do you have left, Joey?

916
01:22:24,849 --> 01:22:27,215
They lose me right
after the bunker scene.

917
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:30,728
What the hell is that?

918
01:22:36,272 --> 01:22:39,054
Get your pies for the great pie fight!

919
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,902
This is our Studio commissary
where some Hollywood stars...

920
01:22:45,968 --> 01:22:47,593
...come to eat. Keep in line.

921
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,287
And now we'll go to the
Special Effects Department.

922
01:23:01,999 --> 01:23:05,065
Yankee bean soup, cole slaw
and tuna surprise.

923
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:44,802
Taxi!

924
01:23:50,028 --> 01:23:51,522
Drive me off this picture!

925
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:20,802
You dropped your beads.

926
01:24:21,131 --> 01:24:22,080
One, please.

927
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,127
Uh, student.

928
01:24:25,611 --> 01:24:26,559
Are you kidding?

929
01:24:29,034 --> 01:24:30,147
Pain in the ass.

930
01:24:30,762 --> 01:24:32,999
Look, Herman,
I'm in Hedy Lamarr's shoes!

931
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:34,086
Hedley!

932
01:25:01,993 --> 01:25:02,789
Freeze it!

933
01:25:03,753 --> 01:25:05,924
Okay, Lamarr, go for your gun.

934
01:25:06,249 --> 01:25:09,183
Wait, wait, I'm unarmed.

935
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:12,487
All right, we'll settle it like men.

936
01:25:13,993 --> 01:25:14,920
With our fists.

937
01:25:16,232 --> 01:25:19,876
Sorry, I just remembered. I am armed.

938
01:25:27,143 --> 01:25:31,616
How did he do such fantastic stunts
with such little feet?

939
01:25:37,351 --> 01:25:38,944
You shot the bad guy!

940
01:25:41,382 --> 01:25:42,789
Well, what do you want to do now?

941
01:25:43,462 --> 01:25:45,699
Come on, let's check out
the end of the flick.

942
01:25:46,567 --> 01:25:49,217
I sure hope there's a happy ending.
I love a happy ending.

943
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:57,500
Sheriff, you can't go now.
We need you.

944
01:25:58,182 --> 01:26:01,597
My work here is done.
I'm needed elsewhere now.

945
01:26:02,342 --> 01:26:05,189
I'm needed wherever
outlaws rule the West.

946
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:09,339
Wherever innocent women and children
are afraid to walk the streets.

947
01:26:09,989 --> 01:26:12,640
Wherever a man cannot
live in simple dignity.

948
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:16,543
Wherever people cry out for justice.

949
01:26:17,349 --> 01:26:18,626
Bullshit!

950
01:26:21,317 --> 01:26:22,593
All right, you caught me.

951
01:26:22,693 --> 01:26:25,791
To speak the plain truth, it's getting
pretty damn dull around here.

952
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,599
Good luck, Bart, and God bless you.

953
01:26:34,628 --> 01:26:35,905
'Bye, baby brother.

954
01:26:37,956 --> 01:26:39,582
Keep the faith, brothers!

955
01:26:55,394 --> 01:26:56,823
Where are you headed, cowboy?

956
01:26:58,243 --> 01:26:59,355
Nowhere special.

957
01:27:02,243 --> 01:27:06,715
Nowhere special.
I always wanted to go there.

958
01:27:08,642 --> 01:27:09,373
Come on!
