1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,000
Stretching out before me is the magnificent Yellowstone.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,640
This is one of the most dynamic...

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,400
..unpredictable and exciting environments on Earth.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,960
Deep in the Rocky Mountains,

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,120
this vast wilderness is home to North America's

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,760
most iconic wildlife.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,320
But every year, Yellowstone's animals are pushed

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,840
to their absolute limits.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,880
Temperatures can swing from -40 in winter

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,920
to approaching plus 40 in summer.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,000
And at the heart of this change is the thaw.

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,960
The melt can last from March to July...

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,360
..and it's one of the most dramatic, natural events on Earth.

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,440
How do the animals cope with such extremes of temperature?

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,560
We're here to find out.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm joined by biologist Patrick Aryee...

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,000
That's intense.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,920
..and a team of wildlife cameramen and expert scientists.

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,360
Previously, we've witnessed how animals survive

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,960
Yellowstone's extremes.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,960
Starting in winter, it was well below freezing

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,240
and some animals really struggled.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,440
Then, in spring, temperatures jumped nearly 30 degrees in a fortnight

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,240
and wildlife had to cope with the thaw coming three weeks early.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,440
Now, summer is here and there are new challenges.

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,160
The meltwater will dry up fast,

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440
food becomes scarce...

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,080
..and if there's no rain,

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,360
wildfires will threaten to destroy the habitats animals rely on.

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,000
SQUEAKING

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,880
Welcome to Yellowstone's Blazing Summer.

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,880
So far in 2016,

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,360
every month has been hotter than average in Greater Yellowstone.

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,560
If the trend continues,

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,360
summer could reach record temperatures

36
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,560
and push animals to the brink of survival.

37
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,880
Yellowstone lies over 600 miles

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,600
from the Pacific and has a continental climate,

39
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,680
which means summers can be relentlessly hot.

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,400
Now, at the moment it's all still looking quite lush and green,

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,040
but in the coming weeks as the temperatures continue to rise,

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,080
the vegetation will start to wither,

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,000
valleys will become dust bowls and lakes and streams

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
will start to dry up.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,800
Wildlife must travel further in search of food,

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,280
drinking water and shelter from the heat.

47
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,160
Young animals born back in spring are now entering their first summer.

48
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,440
They're a lot more mobile, but still need to avoid danger

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,240
whilst exploring on those unsteady legs.

50
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,000
For this latest generation,

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,840
the change in climate will make their lives even more challenging.

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,560
In spring, the beaver family was affected by the

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
unusually warm temperatures.

54
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,680
Huge volumes of meltwater flooded into the Snake River,

55
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,400
where the beavers have made their home in the south

56
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,840
of Greater Yellowstone.

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,880
Snow melting from all the way up there in the Teton Mountains

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,960
rushed down in a deluge and threatened to wash

59
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,480
our beaver dam away.

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,760
Beavers dam rivers to create a series of ponds,

61
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,400
where they live and feed, safe from predators.

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,640
After working flat out on emergency repairs to the dam,

63
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,760
the beavers just managed to save their home from the flood.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,440
Now, in summer, the family could face the opposite challenge -

65
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,160
too little water in the river.

66
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,800
I've come to meet wildlife cameraman Jeff Hogan

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
who's been following the beavers.

68
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,120
Hey, Jeff.

69
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,640
- How's it going?
- There you are. How are you doing?

70
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,600
Jeff was filming great grey owls in spring.

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,360
Now, he'll use his specialist skills to study the beavers and has

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,560
installed an infrared camera inside their lodge.

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,960
SQUEAKING

74
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,600
I've got something to show you.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,040
It was a bit of a surprise.

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,000
'This footage looks like the male and female I saw here in spring.'

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,360
- You see a couple of big, fat beavers?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
SQUEAKING

79
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,360
'But then, something unexpected.'

80
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,200
Oh, my gosh!

81
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
PATRICK LAUGHS

82
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,080
- They're so adorable. 
- That's a great shot.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,440
- Oh, my goodness.
- That's amazing.

84
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,560
No way.

85
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,280
Oh man, they're so adorable.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,920
'Baby beavers are called kits and Mum has given birth to three.'

87
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,520
I would say they're probably about ten weeks of age, maybe.

88
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,560
'Kits are precocial,

89
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,040
'which means they're mobile and quite advanced from birth.

90
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,840
'Emerging with a full coat of thick fur, sharp chisel-like teeth...

91
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
'..and a characteristic flat tail.

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,680
'This, they use as a rudder to steer when swimming,

93
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,720
'which they can do within a day of being born.

94
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,600
'But these three still rely on their family to bring them food

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,040
'from outside the lodge.'

96
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,040
I've got another clip for you.

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,720
SQUEAKING

98
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,120
Look at all that willow.

99
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,760
This adult beaver just brought in three or four branches,

100
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,920
all bundled up.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,560
And the little young ones will just jump on this.

102
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,280
They'll gobble that right down.

103
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280
'At ten weeks old, these kits have stopped drinking

104
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,680
'their mother's milk.

105
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,960
'They now have an adult diet.'

106
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,680
In summer, the ponds the beavers create

107
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,400
become their vegetable gardens.

108
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,120
The slow, warm waters create optimal conditions

109
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,640
for edible plants to grow.

110
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,480
Mum, Dad and last year's young are working overtime collecting food

111
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,640
for the kits and keeping the lodge clean by washing grassy bedding.

112
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,600
In a matter of days,

113
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,560
the kits will leave the lodge and learn to forage for their own food,

114
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,200
whilst avoiding predators.

115
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,760
Around 50% of beaver kits don't survive their first six months.

116
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,920
It's a critical time for this family, and Jeff

117
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,520
will be following them every step of the way.

118
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,760
Across Yellowstone, our teams have been documenting signs

119
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,800
that an early spring thaw kick-started an early summer.

120
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,080
As icy meltwaters flowing off the mountains subsided,

121
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,600
streams warmed rapidly in the sun.

122
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,560
And the surface of the water started to dance.

123
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Rising water temperatures trigger mayflies to hatch in their millions.

124
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,760
These conditions are the starting pistol for an important event...

125
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,120
The arrival of cutthroat trout.

126
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,160
Many have spent the winter in Yellowstone's deep rivers and lakes,

127
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,200
but migrate upstream to feed on mayflies and spawn

128
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
in these shallow waters.

129
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,160
Every year, the arrival of these protein-rich fish creates a

130
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,640
feeding bonanza for river otters, mink,

131
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,000
bears and birds of prey, like eagles and osprey.

132
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,360
Over 20 different species of birds and mammals.

133
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,560
This year, the early snowmelt has given these predators a head start

134
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,880
to fatten up.

135
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,080
While summer temperatures have created a frenzy of activity

136
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,320
on the rivers, Yellowstone's low altitude grasslands

137
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,000
are eerily quiet.

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,960
'In spring, herds of elk and bison were feeding here,

139
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,120
'but they've moved on as the green vegetation withers in the heat.

140
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,760
'What the locals call "the brown-up" has begun.'

141
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,040
Over the course of just a few months, this ground has gone

142
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,760
from being covered in feet of snow to lush grass,

143
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,840
which has now scorched, died away and has very little nutrition.

144
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,080
So grazing animals like bison and elk need to move further up

145
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,480
the mountains in search of green shoots.

146
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,600
As the summer continues, the brown-up will creep higher.

147
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,080
Bison and elk must keep moving.

148
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,960
By July, bison have arrived at summer grazing grounds

149
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,320
on Yellowstone's high plateau.

150
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,200
This is the only time mature males and females come together

151
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,120
and herds can reach a thousand strong.

152
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,440
Scientists think this summer the bison will look

153
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,720
particularly impressive after an abundance of grazing

154
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,480
during a warm spring.

155
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,600
So Kate's gone to check out what kind of condition they're in.

156
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,880
Oh, my goodness!

157
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,840
What a magnificent beast.

158
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,600
The male bison at this time of year are truly just...

159
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,080
They are in their prime.

160
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,000
'Bulls have piled on up to 150kg of fat and muscle

161
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,720
'and now is their chance to start throwing that weight around.

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,440
'July is rutting season, when males duel for the right to mate.

163
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,640
'And this year's favourable conditions mean it will be fierce.

164
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,840
'The largest contenders could be tipping the scales

165
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,360
'at nearly a tonne.'

166
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,040
You may think, "Isn't it a little bit early for sex?

167
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,600
"I mean, you know, it's the summer, they should be chilling out."

168
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,080
But remember that bison are the first to give birth.

169
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,120
Think back to the spring, the first calves we saw,

170
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,520
they were bison calves.

171
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,720
'Female bison have one of the longest pregnancies here,

172
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,480
'lasting over nine months.

173
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,320
'So to time the birth of calves with the start of next spring...

174
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
'..these males need to get on with it.'

175
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,000
This male bison has found himself the perfect dust bath.

176
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,120
And, at various times throughout the day, he will roll in it,

177
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,680
he'll cover himself in dust, he'll pee in the dust

178
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,240
and roll in that.

179
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,160
Just to make sure that he smells as virile and ready for it as possible.

180
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,640
LOW GRUMBLE

181
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,680
'Wallowing in dust baths is a show of strength.

182
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,160
'Each male competes to churn up the biggest dust cloud

183
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,560
'and intimidate its rivals.

184
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,680
'But when two heavyweights won't back down, they go head-to-head.

185
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,720
Heavily-muscled necks and thick skulls covered in a mat of

186
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,240
dense hair help absorb the colossal forces of each collision.

187
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,320
Only the winner earns the right to mate.

188
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,200
This ensures the strongest genes will be passed on.

189
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,320
Whilst I've been following herds of prey animals on the plateau...

190
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,640
..our camera crews are at lower altitudes on the trail of

191
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,680
Yellowstone's top predator, the wolf.

192
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,360
Over 500 wolves roam across Greater Yellowstone.

193
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,640
The mild winter and spring caused many packs to go hungry

194
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,480
as the prey was well fed and could outrun the wolves.

195
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,560
In summer, the stakes are even higher because there are young pups

196
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,600
to feed.

197
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,520
In the south of Greater Yellowstone,

198
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,120
biologists have been studying one wolf pack that seems to be defying

199
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,880
the odds and thriving this year -

200
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
the Pinnacle Peak pack.

201
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,880
This photo was taken during an aerial survey.

202
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,960
It reveals the pack has 11 pups.

203
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,080
Unusually, two females have given birth this year -

204
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,640
a sign this pack is doing well.

205
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,320
All the adults take it in turns to hunt and return to the den sites

206
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,680
with meat for the pups.

207
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,600
But the elk that make up the majority of wolves' prey have moved

208
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
to higher grazing grounds.

209
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,680
The biologists have been observing how the pack finds enough food

210
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,720
for all 11 pups. They've directed wildlife cameraman

211
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,040
Charlie Hamilton James to an area where they've seen

212
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,720
remarkable behaviour.

213
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,160
They think the key to the wolves' success here could be down

214
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,840
to human activity.

215
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,600
See it?

216
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,560
I wonder if

217
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,000
she's going to let me get out.

218
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,600
I'm going to give it a go.

219
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,640
Bear with me on this.

220
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,200
- WHISPERS:
- Well, well, well, well, well!

221
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,840
How beautiful is that?

222
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,720
She can smell me. My scent is going straight ahead.

223
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,760
She knows I'm here.

224
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,240
She's not bothered at all.

225
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,880
In all his 20 years of filming,

226
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,160
Charlie has never been this close to a wild wolf.

227
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,360
This female is from the Pinnacle Peak pack.

228
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,800
And something has drawn her here.

229
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,720
The grass is still green

230
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,280
because it's been watered over the summer to improve grazing.

231
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,840
You can see all these sprinklers behind her.

232
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,400
Cos they're watering the grass,

233
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,920
it's created some amazing habitat for ground squirrels.

234
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,560
There's just tonnes of them.

235
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,760
A huge colony of grass-eating

236
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,960
Uinta ground squirrels is exploiting this artificial oasis.

237
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,600
Usually, by mid-July, the grass would be turning brown and inedible.

238
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,560
The squirrels would have started entering their burrows to hibernate,

239
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,600
but not here.

240
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,520
This female wolf has spotted the chance of an easy meal.

241
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,920
And it's closer to the pups than the large elk herds 20 miles away.

242
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,360
They need these ground squirrels cos they're tied to their territory.

243
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,680
They've got pups here, they can't go anywhere else,

244
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,360
so they have to find food around here...

245
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,720
..just to survive and keep those pups alive.

246
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,160
But catching these burrowing rodents is tricky.

247
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,400
They spend much of their time looking for danger,

248
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,040
balancing on their hind legs to see over the tall grass.

249
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,160
The squirrels also have a range of alarm calls for different threats.

250
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,480
SQUIRREL TRILLS

251
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,720
A trill means it's a ground-based predator.

252
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,440
SQUIRREL TRILLS

253
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,440
The entire colony dive for the safety of their burrows.

254
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,320
Look at that! She's on it. She's on one. She's on one. Oh!

255
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,520
This female is putting in a lot of work but without any reward.

256
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,040
Oh, there's another one. There we go! There's one running.

257
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,760
Ah! Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

258
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,800
A long way off.

259
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,800
Another pack member may help turn the tables.

260
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,720
Wolves' real strength is when they hunt together.

261
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,560
There's another one.

262
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,000
There's another wolf!

263
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,040
I don't know which one to film now.

264
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,080
SQUIRRELS TRILL

265
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,720
The ground squirrels can't watch all three wolves at once.

266
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,360
And these newcomers are also trying a different hunting strategy

267
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,120
to outwit their quarry.

268
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
SQUIRREL SQUEAKS

269
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
There's a lot of activity and then they'll lie down.

270
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,440
And you think, well, why are they suddenly lying down?

271
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,760
Part of their hunting strategy is to lie down

272
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,040
and essentially just wait for the ground squirrels to come up to them,

273
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,600
you know, and they're sort of dozing and they're half asleep, and

274
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,920
a ground squirrel comes up and they just leap up and grab it.

275
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,200
It's working.

276
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,680
Even the original female is having more luck.

277
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,120
With animals, you get these peak moments of activity and they last

278
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,040
for a few days or a few weeks and then they're gone again.

279
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,000
It's incredibly lucky that we've been able to be here for this

280
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,880
particular period of peak activity.

281
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,560
I've never seen it before, I don't know if it'll ever happen again,

282
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,240
but it's amazing to witness it.

283
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,120
These wolves have used all their intelligence to exploit this situation.

284
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,000
The food will increase the pups' chance of survival.

285
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,200
And more wolves means a stronger pack next year.

286
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,400
It's early July and no rain has fallen this month

287
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,480
at the Snake River, where the beavers have their home.

288
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,000
This, combined with the early snow melt,

289
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,160
means that the river is running 20% below its average.

290
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,240
If the level of the beavers' main pond drops too low, it could expose

291
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,920
the entrance to their lodge, which is usually underwater.

292
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,680
And this would make them easy pickings for predators.

293
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,960
Jeff is watching them closely to see how they react.

294
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,400
Oh, look! Wow!

295
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
That's Mum.

296
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,640
And it looks like Mum has made an executive decision.

297
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,080
She's got one of the kits in her mouth.

298
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,200
She's heading towards the dam.

299
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,920
She's moving one of her kits out of the pond,

300
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,760
maybe to search for a new home.

301
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,880
This is incredible!

302
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,840
And there they go.

303
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,160
I'm going to go chase them.

304
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,720
Scientists have observed beaver families relocating,

305
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,560
but Jeff has never witnessed it in 20 years of studying them.

306
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:36,120
Out in the open, kits are vulnerable to predators like bald eagles.

307
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,760
It's a tense moment for Mum and her young.

308
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,040
Here they come.

309
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,880
The beaver family's territory is large,

310
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,640
with five dams and pools along this river.

311
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,920
She's going to crawl over this next dam.

312
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,840
After travelling more than 350 metres...

313
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,920
..and crossing three more dams...

314
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,520
..Jeff films the mum leading her kit up a small channel that comes off

315
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,400
the main river.

316
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,040
They're going to climb right up through this cascading stream...

317
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,920
..waddling up through the stones.

318
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,400
You can see that the beavers don't do quite so well on land,

319
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,240
especially with this river rock.

320
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,080
They do so much better in the water.

321
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,120
Unreal!

322
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,680
Never seen this, ever!

323
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
And there they go.

324
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,160
Later, at night, Jeff checks his camera in the lodge.

325
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,200
Let's see.

326
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,040
It reveals Mum has moved all the kits and the whole family has

327
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,800
abandoned their home.

328
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,440
Jeff is now on a mission to find out where the beavers have gone...

329
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,680
..if the kits survive and whether this huge gamble will pay off.

330
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,440
Whilst the low-lying rivers and grasslands are sweltering

331
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,240
in temperatures of nearly 30 degrees...

332
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,880
..2,000 metres up, Yellowstone peaks have a recent dusting of fresh snow.

333
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,160
And the mountain meadows are a riot of colour.

334
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,640
It is amazing, the contrast up here to down in the valley.

335
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,480
Down in the valley, summer has really taken grip -

336
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,800
the temperatures are quite high and the grass is starting to go brown.

337
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,240
But up here, 800 metres higher, it's a totally different story.

338
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,320
It's breezy, it's cool, and look at all these magnificent wild flowers!

339
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,920
Susan Marsh is a naturalist and she pays very close attention to these

340
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,120
high-altitude wild flowers.

341
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,680
Where most people see pretty petals,

342
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:54,360
Susan sees a living record of how this ecosystem is being affected

343
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,200
by this year's weather and the changing climate.

344
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,080
We've looked a lot at how animals can indicate

345
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
the state of how a year is progressing,

346
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,720
as far as the weather is concerned.

347
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,480
Are the plants just as valuable as indicators?

348
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,760
Yes. I think they are

349
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,040
and the one advantage

350
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,880
that they have, in my opinion,

351
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,640
is that they don't run off!

352
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,800
And they don't fly away.

353
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,600
- Very true.
- I can tell by how tall they are, first of all.

354
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,200
- Right.
- This one is fireweed.

355
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,040
And it, typically, in a really lush year, will grow head high.

356
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,440
- Wow!
- Even at this elevation.

357
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,000
These particular ones, you can see, are only a couple of feet tall.

358
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,400
- Yeah, yeah.
- To me that's an indication of heat and dryness.

359
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,600
The plant needs to set seed and it has a very short growing season,

360
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,480
so it's not going to waste its energy making a big, tall stalk,

361
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,320
or making great big leaves.

362
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,800
- Right.
- These leaves are small this year, smaller than usual.

363
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,080
Through these plants, Susan can chart this year's erratic weather

364
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,160
but can plants also indicate larger changes?

365
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,160
Everyone is talking about the fact that the climate is changing.

366
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,280
Is that something that is becoming evident in the plants?

367
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,240
It's typically on the mountain tops.

368
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,880
So that's above the tree line.

369
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,120
Above the trees, where there's rocks and wind and cold.

370
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,040
It's the coldest part of Yellowstone, above 3,000 metres,

371
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,200
where Susan is seeing the effects of climate change hit hard.

372
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,720
This is the alpine zone, a realm of high-altitude specialists.

373
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,640
But as temperatures keep getting warmer,

374
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,400
non-specialist plants are able to survive higher up the mountains

375
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,120
and they're invading this fragile zone.

376
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,760
Does it concern you that you are seeing

377
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,880
a march towards a very different climate

378
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,440
and, therefore, a very different ecosystem?

379
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,720
I think there will be some good and some bad,

380
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,880
depending on what species you are, as climate change continues.

381
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,360
But, yes, I don't want to lose the wildflower parts that I love.

382
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,240
I don't want to lose the alpine zone.

383
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,960
I don't want to see those go,

384
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,440
but I don't think I can stop it.

385
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,200
Climatologists studying Greater Yellowstone

386
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,800
have charted temperatures increasing

387
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,600
by nearly a fifth of a degree every decade.

388
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,320
This seemingly small change is having far-reaching consequences.

389
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,840
Across Yellowstone,

390
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,600
scientists are seeing how animals are being forced to adapt.

391
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,160
Even the most iconic species like the grizzly bear are being affected.

392
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
To find out what's going on,

393
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,240
Patrick has gone to the Gallatin mountain range

394
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,680
in the north-west of Greater Yellowstone.

395
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,000
I've come to meet our bear expert, Casey Anderson,

396
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,240
to see how one group of grizzly bears is coping,

397
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,960
as the changing climate threatens an important food source.

398
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,680
If you look up at this knob up here,

399
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,600
take a look at the trees just around the bottom of that.

400
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,920
Those are white bark pines.

401
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,960
Let's have a look.

402
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,400
That entire forest of white bark pine, ancient trees,

403
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,800
some of them are 300 years old,

404
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,640
they've all died in the last couple of years.

405
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,680
They're gone.

406
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,440
What's caused it to die off?

407
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,600
There's a pine beetle that's always existed up there,

408
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,000
but we've had these cold winters

409
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,920
that usually just killed most of the beetles,

410
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,960
but now, with climate change, those winters are not as harsh,

411
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,320
we're not having that beetle kill

412
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,520
that we're used to in the middle of the winter,

413
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,760
so the beetles are really starting to infest the forest.

414
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,560
Pine beetles are no bigger than grains of rice

415
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,560
but these small creatures cause big problems.

416
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,640
Not only do their young eat the trees' living tissue,

417
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,920
but they also introduce a destructive fungus.

418
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,720
Eventually, this combination kills the entire tree.

419
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,600
This is bad news for the animals

420
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,080
that rely upon the food and shelter this tree provides.

421
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,680
Towards the end of summer, as other food sources dry up,

422
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,160
these pine nuts usually provide vital protein for grizzlies.

423
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,880
One aerial survey revealed around 80% of mature white barked trees in

424
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,120
Greater Yellowstone show signs

425
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,120
of moderate-to-severe beetle infestation.

426
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,080
To survive, the bears must adapt

427
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,200
and Casey has witnessed some intriguing behaviour.

428
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,240
Grizzlies are leaving the wilderness

429
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,920
to congregate on this cattle ranch to feed.

430
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,840
What they are eating is this caraway root

431
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,720
that actually came in with livestock.

432
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,280
It's actually an introduced species not native to the area

433
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,680
and they're coming down here and taking advantage of it.

434
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,560
And all the bears in the area are starting to migrate towards this meadow

435
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,320
because there's not a lot of food out there in the summer but,

436
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,160
right here, this is like a bear buffet!

437
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,880
It's a race against time.

438
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,600
The bears must pile on enough fat

439
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,640
to see them through five months of hibernation.

440
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,880
While the root is at its most abundant in summer and autumn,

441
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,680
the grizzlies gorge throughout the night,

442
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,440
eating up to 20,000 calories in a single sitting.

443
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,240
As the day heats up,

444
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,480
the hot sun forces them back into the shady forest to rest.

445
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,800
But Casey and our mobile camera team

446
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,120
have seen two bears that are still out in the midday sun.

447
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,960
Hey, Casey, do you copy?

448
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,440
They're, like, totally tumbling around out there.

449
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,280
Well, they're little playful guys!

450
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,920
These two yearlings are orphans.

451
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,880
Unfortunately, their mum died last autumn but,

452
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,040
against the odds, they have turned up in this meadow.

453
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,640
I've joined Casey to see how they're doing.

454
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,400
Right here, there's two yearling grizzly cubs,

455
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,880
right out here, digging around.

456
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,640
Oh, yeah, right there.

457
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,360
They're still young and inexperienced.

458
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,920
Cubs usually stay with their mums for up to three and a half years

459
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,680
but, even with this protection,

460
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,360
almost a third won't survive in Yellowstone.

461
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,560
It's a miracle that these two

462
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,600
made it through an entire winter on their own.

463
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,880
Do you think that having one another

464
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,000
is one of the reasons why they've made it this far?

465
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,200
I think it's got to be one of the biggest reasons.

466
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,440
If they didn't have each other, I don't think there's any chance

467
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,560
that one of them would have survived.

468
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,400
They've got each other's back.

469
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,800
Whilst feeding on this working ranch,

470
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,520
there are lots of unusual sights and sounds.

471
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,640
But without a mum to teach them,

472
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,240
it's hard for the cubs to know what is and isn't dangerous.

473
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,960
You find yourself really worrying about them

474
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,000
because they don't have

475
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,880
that notorious Mama Grizzly looking out for them.

476
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,720
Yeah, they're looking a little bit nervous.

477
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,840
So they're looking at something over in the distance.

478
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,000
They've obviously sensed something in that direction.

479
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,880
I think that these two have probably been chased,

480
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,360
probably once a day, by something, whether it's another grizzly,

481
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,480
a pack of wolves, or even cattle.

482
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,400
Surprisingly, the dangers may not come from the ranchers

483
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,720
or their cattle.

484
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,840
Most have learned to live alongside their grizzly neighbours.

485
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,840
One of the biggest threats comes in the form of other bears

486
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,200
close by in the shade of the forests.

487
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,000
A big male grizzly, known as a boar, could kill and eat the cubs

488
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,080
but it looks like these two have found a way to avoid this danger.

489
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,160
The big boars and other bears are out at night

490
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,640
because when it's hot, like this,

491
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,680
most bears will not come out and dig,

492
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,480
because it just wears them out.

493
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,160
And as the sun comes up, they go back to the forest.

494
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,640
With these little guys, they're kind of on the opposite schedule.

495
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,200
When the danger goes away, it's time to eat.

496
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,240
Let's do it in the heat of the day when there's nobody else out here.

497
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,480
Where you don't have to worry about anything.

498
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,480
That's what they're doing and it's working for them.

499
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,000
It's an amazing strategy.

500
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,960
The two cubs are a fantastic indicator

501
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,840
of just how intelligent bears can be.

502
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,680
Even as climate change kills off the white bark pine,

503
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,160
the bears are adapting to exploit the opportunities.

504
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,320
With over 700 grizzlies in Greater Yellowstone,

505
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,480
the latest data suggests their population, for now, at least,

506
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,960
has remained stable.

507
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,680
Yellowstone hasn't reached its record temperature of 36 degrees

508
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,080
but climate data has revealed that July, this year,

509
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,480
was the seventh month in a row with above average temperatures.

510
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,440
The relentless heat

511
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,880
and the early thaw are a dangerous combination.

512
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,000
They may create perfect conditions...

513
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,040
..for wildfires.

514
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,240
In normal years, the snowmelt would come down off the mountains,

515
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,120
and it would hang around places, like this,

516
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,120
soaking into all this dead wood, but not this year.

517
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,120
What it did was come rushing off in a great torrent

518
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,720
into the rivers, into the streams, into the lakes

519
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,680
and it didn't have time to soak into all of this dead, dry wood.

520
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,600
So this is, basically, fuel for fires

521
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,480
and having so much dead, dry wood around

522
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,160
means that there is a danger this year

523
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,760
of bigger and more intense fires.

524
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,520
A single spark could set this landscape alight.

525
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Every summer, an average of 26 wildfires

526
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,800
are started by lightning across Yellowstone National Park.

527
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,120
Our crews are out, following up on reports of wildfire.

528
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,640
Flames can reach heights of 50 metres, exceed 1,200 Celsius,

529
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,880
and rip through the landscape at up to 40mph.

530
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,880
By mid-August, the tinder-dry conditions

531
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,600
mean five major fires have taken hold,

532
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,000
and are raging across the region.

533
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,000
In the Beartooth Mountains is wildlife cameraman Jeff Hogan.

534
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,360
Oh, no, this is nuts!

535
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,120
He's filming a wildfire that's consuming a huge area of forest.

536
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,400
And it's headed straight towards the family of great grey owls

537
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,600
he's been following since spring.

538
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,040
This fire is huge, and it's raging.

539
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,200
It's right in the backyard of our great grey owl family.

540
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,600
This is really a threat.

541
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,800
So far, the chicks have done much better than expected.

542
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,600
There was only a 20% chance all three would make it out of the nest.

543
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,800
Oh, he's going to go, he's going to go.

544
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,040
Jump, jump!

545
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,640
Oh, wow!

546
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,840
Jeff thought their biggest challenges were over.

547
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,360
But now, he'll have to wait until the fire's died down

548
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,480
to see if these young owls survive.

549
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,440
Oh, my goodness.

550
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,600
The aftermath of a fire might seem devastating,

551
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,760
but it's actually part of the forest's natural cycle.

552
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,160
It brings growth and new life.

553
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,840
All this ash is actually really fertile

554
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,080
and as soon as it rains,

555
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,320
new green shoots are going to start popping up,

556
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,880
and that's going to encourage grazers like elk and deer

557
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,360
to come into this area and, eventually, grizzly bears.

558
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,600
But not only that, some plants have actually evolved

559
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,920
to benefit from fires. These here are lodgepole pine cones

560
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,840
and they only open up once they reach a specific temperature

561
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,920
that can only be produced by a fire

562
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,520
and then these seeds will eventually fall off,

563
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,840
down into the ground

564
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,760
and be fertilised by the ash.

565
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,720
Fires are a natural part of life here.

566
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,280
But by the time they die down,

567
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,640
they will have burnt nearly 100 square miles of land.

568
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,360
This year's fires will have been the most destructive

569
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,840
inside Yellowstone National Park since 1988.

570
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,920
Large-scale fires used to sweep through the park

571
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
around every 300 years.

572
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,160
But scientists now believe that the warming climate could result

573
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,640
in them happening every 3-5 years by the end of this century.

574
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,960
This could result in the destruction of the forest

575
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,880
that's home to the fragile population of great grey owls.

576
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,040
Jeff is searching the area at the edge of the burn

577
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,320
for any sign of the owl family.

578
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,200
There's a lot of ground to cover

579
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,080
so Jeff calls in expert animal tracker Dan Hartman.

580
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,840
After four days' searching,

581
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,480
Dan finally hears an adult great grey.

582
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,120
OWL CALLS

583
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,520
And close by, one of the young owls.

584
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,760
OWL CALLS CONTINUE

585
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,080
After another few minutes watching and listening,

586
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,720
he spots the other two siblings.

587
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,880
All of them have survived.

588
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,280
And they're even making their first attempt at hunting.

589
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,560
The owl chicks have all made it through their first summer,

590
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,200
but we still don't know the fate of the beaver mum and her three kits.

591
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,600
I've joined Jeff on a tributary of the Snake River,

592
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:43,520
where he's seen signs that the beavers are making a new home.

593
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,760
He thinks it's a safer location,

594
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,120
as the water level is higher than at their old pond.

595
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,520
Oh, look.

596
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,680
There's your beaver sitting there.

597
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,880
Oh, my... Is it that beaver there?

598
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,920
That's the beaver, right there.

599
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,360
This is just gold dust.

600
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,040
This looks like Mum.

601
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,280
And in the few weeks since moving, the family has been busy building.

602
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,680
That is a new lodge being built right now.

603
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,440
They just make a big pile of sticks,

604
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,000
then they go into it and start digging it up

605
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,960
and they'll pile mud and stuff up on top of it.

606
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,560
This is a lodge at its early stages.

607
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,840
This is rare.

608
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,560
Rarely do you see the very early stages of a whole new beaver pond

609
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,560
with a lodge like this.

610
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,960
They're concentrating on their dam,

611
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,160
strengthening it with rocks and plugging any leaks

612
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,840
with weeds and mud to create a deep, wide pond.

613
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,000
The water table here is rising so that they can reach out

614
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,960
and get more of this food, the trees that grow around here,

615
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,640
cotton woods, alders, willows.

616
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,000
The beavers can now access all this untapped food...

617
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,840
..without having to venture far onto dry land, where they are vulnerable.

618
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,080
'Finally, Jeff spots what we've both been hoping to see.'

619
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,400
- Oh, yeah.
- There's a young one.

620
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,000
- There's the young one.
- Yes, yes.

621
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,000
We've got our three young beavers right here, the three kits.

622
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,040
- They're getting big.
- They are.

623
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,440
They're getting big fast.

624
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,040
Mum's risky gamble appears to have paid off.

625
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,960
This deep pond with a new lodge and plenty of food

626
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,920
is everything the kits will need to thrive.

627
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,240
They are so inquisitive, aren't they?

628
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,480
And they're just...

629
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,200
They're just fabulous to watch.

630
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,960
The kits will stay with their parents for the next two years.

631
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,400
In that time, they'll learn the engineering skills needed

632
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,080
to build a dam and a lodge.

633
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,760
The secret to the beavers' success

634
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,320
is adapting the landscape to suit their needs.

635
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,840
It's engineering on a scale that has only been surpassed by humans.

636
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,040
Every year, the challenges in Yellowstone are getting greater,

637
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,560
as climate change results in more extreme weather.

638
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,320
Yellowstone's residents have developed

639
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,400
clever strategies to survive.

640
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,920
But the last animal I want to see

641
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,320
is quickly running out of options as temperatures rise.

642
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,680
I've come up to 3,000 metres and the fragile alpine zone.

643
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:56,440
Only one specialist mammal is active up here all year round -

644
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,840
the pika.

645
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,440
And Kaitlyn Hanley is the hardy researcher who studies them.

646
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,840
I've got glimpses of pika.

647
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,480
Are they a member of the rabbit family?

648
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,920
They call them rock rabbits.

649
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,880
- SQUEAKING 
- Oh, there was one.
- A little call?

650
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,680
Yeah, that was a pika.

651
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,160
Come on, Kaitlyn.

652
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,800
- I want you to...
- He's right there.

653
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,120
Oh, my goodness, there he is!

654
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,320
Pikas are thought to have evolved from ancestors in Siberia -

655
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,000
one of the coldest places on Earth.

656
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Their odd appearance is all about keeping warm.

657
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,760
A plump, round shape minimises surface heat loss

658
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,560
and thick fur covers their entire bodies,

659
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,000
even their toes.

660
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,880
For pikas, summer is all about collecting food.

661
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,120
I imagine that up here,

662
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,640
the season where there is any food at all is pretty short.

663
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,400
Yes, and they don't hibernate in the winter

664
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,600
so they actually collect hay through the entire summer.

665
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,400
And they'll use that as their food source during the winter.

666
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,960
- So that's what they're doing now? 
- Yes, they are haying, yes.

667
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
They'll get these huge hay piles under the rocks

668
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,680
and they'll use that in the winter.

669
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,880
And, yeah, they're the only mammal that doesn't hibernate up this high.

670
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,200
And they can survive?

671
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,240
Cos the snow must come here, what, in October?

672
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,040
Yeah, so it would be October...

673
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,760
Through to?

674
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,640
March, May.

675
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,240
So, they've got a matter of months to collect enough hay

676
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,560
to get them through the whole of the winter.

677
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,200
Yes. They're busy little bees, that's for sure.

678
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,640
Pikas love a cool climate.

679
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,840
Just a few hours' exposure

680
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,800
to temperatures of 21 degrees can prove fatal.

681
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,640
So they can only exist in Yellowstone above 2,000 metres.

682
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:35,000
Soon, even here, they may have nowhere left to go.

683
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,040
Because these animals are such high alpine specialists,

684
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,080
they can't survive at the lower elevations.

685
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,240
Does that make them particularly vulnerable

686
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,080
- to things like climatic changes? 
- Absolutely.

687
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,280
They are very sensitive to heat.

688
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,720
And so as climate change and the habitat changes for them,

689
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,440
they're going to move upslope.

690
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,400
You're already upslope at this point, you can't go any further.

691
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,200
And so, for the pika, you know, they don't have anywhere to move.

692
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,920
They're running into the sky.

693
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,240
Scientists have already seen pikas disappear

694
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,040
from one-third of their former strongholds

695
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,320
in warmer states to the south.

696
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,760
But Yellowstone's high country still provides sanctuary.

697
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,080
At least for now.

698
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,280
I have hope. I don't think we should lose hope.

699
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,000
Because they're too cute to go extinct!

700
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,080
That's one very good reason

701
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,800
we should all be there to save the pika

702
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,200
is they're just too cute to go extinct!

703
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,840
PIKA CALLS

704
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,240
The arrival of autumn marks the end of the great thaw.

705
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,360
We've seen how the dramatic seasonal changes

706
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,480
affected Yellowstone's wildlife.

707
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,720
The mild winter meant the wolves struggled

708
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,280
to hunt strong, well-fed prey.

709
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,720
And many went hungry.

710
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,920
WOLF HOWLS

711
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,280
But in the summer, they used their cunning

712
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,560
to find food and keep their pups alive.

713
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,480
The beavers survived the spring run-off

714
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,080
and were able to build an entirely new home to raise their three kits.

715
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,880
Our great grey owl runt beat all the odds

716
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,920
and fledged with its two siblings...

717
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,560
..giving this vulnerable population a much-needed boost.

718
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,920
The grizzly bears' race to fatten up started early

719
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,200
with the mild winter conditions.

720
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:07,160
The wet spring and early green-up revealed a bounty of food.

721
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:12,360
But by summer, they had to use all their resourcefulness to survive.

722
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,280
This has been a magical window into the lives of wildlife

723
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,520
in a truly spectacular landscape.

724
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,840
We've also seen a bigger picture unfold,

725
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,120
as scientists try to predict

726
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,600
what the future for Yellowstone will look like as the climate shifts.

727
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,320
I think what we do know is all of it's going to change

728
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,040
and it's changing pretty rapidly

729
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,120
and we don't really know how it's going to change.

730
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,800
There will be some good and some bad,

731
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,840
depending on what species you are, as climate change continues.

732
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,520
There are still many challenges ahead.

733
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,840
But if there's one thing that all of Yellowstone's animals share,

734
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,880
it's their incredible ability to adapt to extreme change.

735
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,320
And this will give them the best possible chance to survive,

736
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,920
whatever the future brings.
