WIND GUSTS

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,160
Stretching out before me is the magnificent Yellowstone.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,720
This is one of the most dynamic...

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,200
..unpredictable...

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,360
..and exciting environments on Earth.

00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,640
HELICOPTER HUMS

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,320
Deep in the Rocky Mountains,

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,360
this vast wilderness is home

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,080
to North America's most iconic wildlife.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,600
But every year,

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Yellowstone's animals are pushed to their absolute limits.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,880
Temperatures can swing from minus 40 in winter

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,640
to almost plus 40 during the summer.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,040
And at the heart of this change is the thaw.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,040
The melt can last several months from March to July.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,600
And it's one of the most dramatic, natural events on Earth.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,880
How do the animals cope

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,480
with such extremes of temperature?

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,280
We're here to find out.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,520
I'm joined by biologist Patrick Aryee...

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,480
Ooh! That's intense. >

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,080
..and a team of wildlife cameramen and expert scientists.

23
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,520
Last night, we brought you winter.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,440
Wildlife struggled in freezing temperatures.

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,600
BISON GROWLS

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
Tonight, it's spring.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,080
Life is about to change, but not always for the better.

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,040
The thaw will melt the snow in the mountains

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,600
and cause over one million tonnes of meltwater

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,760
to crash through Yellowstone.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,120
Only the strongest animals will survive.

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,120
Welcome to Yellowstone - The Toughest Spring.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,240
It's the end of April and seven degrees Celsius.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
The thaw is well under way.

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
BIRDS CRY

36
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,800
Spring has come to Yellowstone.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Mammals, big and small, are emerging from their dens,

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,960
birds are courting and nesting,

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,800
the days are getting longer and warmer.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Now, you may think that life is going to get easier.

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,680
Yellowstone is bursting into life.

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,680
Hummingbirds return after spending their winter in the warm south.

43
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,400
Moose feast on the first green shoots.

BIRD WARBLES

45
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,440
Bison migrate back to their calving grounds.

46
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,680
We're in the north-west of the USA,

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
2,000 metres high up in the Rockies.

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,520
Known as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem,

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,440
it's an area the size of Scotland,

50
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,880
includes two National Parks

51
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,400
and is bounded on three sides by mountain ranges.

52
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,720
Biologist, Patrick Aryee, is at the southern end of Greater Yellowstone,

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,480
catching up with one species

54
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,680
that faces its greatest challenge in spring.

55
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,360
Behind me are the Teton Mountains

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,800
and this is the Snake River,

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,400
home to North America's largest rodent, the beaver.

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,240
There are 15 of them living on this stretch of river

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,120
and they've built this enormous dam.

60
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,400
I can't believe that this dam is not a man-made structure

61
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,680
and that it's been made by beavers.

62
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,400
I mean, it's incredible.

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,200
Look at the size... of these...branches, and even...

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Look, here we've got these huge rocks as well.

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,760
It acts as a way to slow down the waterways, like speed bumps, almost,

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,040
but I've got to say that they are nature's most incredible engineers.

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,440
But at this time of year,

68
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
their dam is in real danger.

69
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,640
Soon enough, all that snow is going to melt

70
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,520
and all that meltwater is going to start flowing down

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,000
into these river systems.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,480
And as that water starts to flow and cascade along this river,

73
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,680
it could damage and even destroy,

74
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,960
not only the dam, but also the lodge.

75
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,760
And the lodge is where the beavers have been holed up

76
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,320
for the last five months.

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,280
Now, we've got a camera set up so we can actually see

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,000
exactly what's going on inside there right now.

79
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,280
If I come over here...

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,000
That is incredible.

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,240
Oh, they're just starting to wake up.

82
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,600
BEAVERS GROAN

83
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,480
In this lodge, we've got... There's two yearlings in there,

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,640
two two-year-olds and then one adult.

85
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,160
There should be another one, but I can't see it.

86
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,160
This is our beaver family

87
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,560
and we're going to be getting to know them very well.

88
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,640
BEAVERS SQUEAK

89
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,080
And we'll be following them over the coming months to see how they cope

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,680
when the spring floods hit.

91
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,400
Just seen one dive.

92
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,560
Beavers are most comfortable in water.

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,160
Their lumbering bodies are quite ungainly on land.

94
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,840
He's huge!

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,280
This stretch of river is home to 15 beavers.

96
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,000
In April, the river bank is usually covered in a blanket of snow.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,840
So the beavers stay snuggled in their den.

98
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,280
But this year, the snow has already disappeared.

99
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,600
According to scientists, the thaw is three weeks early.

100
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,440
That means the beavers can start venturing out

101
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,000
on the search for new green shoots.

102
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,840
This is brilliant, I'm just following this beaver...

103
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,080
and hopefully, I'll get to see him when he comes up onto this next dam.

104
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,920
This beaver hasn't eaten fresh food for five months.

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,120
Over winter, the beavers' food supply is locked in snow and ice.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,640
They feed on twigs, leaves and bark of aspen and willow trees.

107
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,520
But when there's so much snow on the ground, they can't get to it.

108
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,840
Yet, beavers don't hibernate,

109
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,000
so they must keep eating throughout the winter to survive.

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,120
Their solution is ingenious.

111
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,600
They collect a mound of twigs and vegetation,

112
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,160
big enough to last for five months

113
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,920
and store it by the underwater entrance to their home.

114
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,240
Even when the river freezes over,

115
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,120
they have a larder just a moment's swim away.

116
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,720
But by the end of winter,

117
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,520
the rotten twigs have lost most of their protein.

118
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,680
This beaver is surviving on his own body fat.

119
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,960
The early thaw, however, has given him a lifeline.

120
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
This year, he can forage for fresh food

121
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,120
three weeks earlier than normal.

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,440
It's just what his hungry family needs.

123
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,320
OK, that adult is now back inside the lodge.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,320
And it's got a mouth full of vegetation.

125
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,120
BEAVERS SQUEAK

126
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,200
These beavers have lost a third of their body weight over winter.

127
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,520
To gain that weight back,

128
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,280
they'll need to eat a kilogram of twigs and leaves every single day.

129
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,240
The younger beavers squeak to demand food

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,360
but when competition is this fierce...

131
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,680
it's every beaver for itself.

132
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,760
YOUNG BEAVERS SQUEAK

133
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,720
In spring, twigs are rich in sugars and proteins,

134
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,200
just what they need to kick-start their recovery.

135
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,960
But to reach the fresh food, the beavers must first get to work.

136
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,040
Not only are beavers phenomenal engineers, building all those dams,

137
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
but they're also professional lumberjacks

138
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,920
and they can take down whole trees, just like this one,

139
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,840
and they do that using their super-sharp teeth.

140
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,800
These bottom teeth are just like chisels

141
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
and what they'll do is get their head in sideways

142
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,640
and chew away at the bark.

143
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,920
With smaller trees, they'll go right the way through

144
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
and you'll often see beavers running away

145
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,480
just before the trees fall down.

146
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,240
But with bigger ones, like this one,

147
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,160
they'll only get so far and then they'll move away

148
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,440
and let the wind do the rest of the job.

149
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,080
Now this is a really big tree.

150
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,440
But the part the beavers are really interested in is up here,

151
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
the top third,

152
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,160
and I can see where they've gnawed away at this end

153
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,680
and hauled all their branches back to the river

154
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,000
to construct their lodge and the dams.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And making sure their dams are reinforced

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,600
before the spring floods hit is crucial.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,760
There are five dams on this stretch of river.

158
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,920
This entire waterway, this system has been created by these beavers.

159
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,000
They've made these...series of dams,

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,360
which kind of create this lock system.

161
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,240
The beavers have turned, what was a small stream,

162
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,920
into a series of deep ponds.

163
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,320
These pools allow them to stay in the water while foraging.

164
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,600
On land, they're easy prey for predators, like wolves and bears.

165
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,640
But crucially, this dam system also slows down the floodwater.

166
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,280
At two metres wide and 40 metres long, the main dam is the strongest.

167
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,880
But if this one breaches, the others will go too.

168
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,360
BEAVER MOANS

169
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,680
Right now, the beavers are safe in their lodge.

170
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,520
But I'll follow them closely

171
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,560
and find out how they get on as spring takes hold.

172
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,920
For many animals, spring is the most important time of year.

173
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,000
It's now May.

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,880
BIRD WARBLES

175
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,240
As soon as the snow melts,

176
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,960
fresh vegetation appears.

177
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
Scientists call it the "spring green-up"

178
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,120
and it drives all life in Yellowstone.

179
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,800
One animal relies on it more than almost any other...

180
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,360
The Rocky Mountain elk.

181
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,120
There are over 20,000 elk in Yellowstone.

182
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,880
As the green-up moves from the lowlands to high mountain pastures,

183
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,600
the elk move with it.

184
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,520
This magnificent herd of elk that are straddling right across

185
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,120
the sagebrush here and up the hill,

186
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,240
are on their way to the calving grounds,

187
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
a little bit further north from here.

188
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,960
They'll be giving birth over the next few weeks.

189
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,720
They'll hide their youngsters in the undergrowth

190
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,120
while they go off to feed.

191
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,680
This is a crucial move in order to protect them from predation

192
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,800
by the largest carnivore here... the grizzly bear.

193
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,600
Now, there are some grizzlies

194
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,680
that have become particularly adept at finding those youngsters.

195
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
And that source of protein

196
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,640
is really great for adult bears and their cubs,

197
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,920
needing desperately to put on weight after a long winter hibernation.

198
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,800
It's as the snow line retreats from the valleys to the foothills

199
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,320
that the female grizzlies and their cubs start emerging.

200
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,360
They usually stay close to their dens until the end of May,

201
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,040
but this year, the warm weather has enticed the bears away

202
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,400
earlier than usual.

203
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,640
But the elk calves won't be born for another month.

204
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,160
So life for these cubs will now be harder.

205
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,400
They will have to scratch a living digging up roots and grasses.

206
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,120
Grizzly expert, Casey Anderson,

207
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
is already seeing signs that there are plenty of bears around.

208
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,520
They've been using trees as scratching posts.

209
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,640
Yeah, this thing has been getting hammered, look at all this.

210
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,240
They're leaving their scent behind.

211
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,960
Cos there's just all kinds of mud and hair stuck on here, so...

212
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,840
Yeah, it's going to be cool to see who is back in town.

213
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,240
Patrick is joining Casey in the Gallatin Mountains

214
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,440
to find out whether the early bears

215
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,120
are getting enough to eat.

216
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,800
Casey's tracked the mother and her two-year-old cubs to a wooded area

217
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,280
halfway down the mountain.

218
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,760
They've been feeding all morning and are likely to be somewhere close by.

219
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,720
From here on, we've got to go slow, even lower our voice.

220
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,120
The wind's really going in the wrong direction.

221
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,440
The wind's carrying our scent right towards where the grizzly bears are

222
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,760
and they have a sense of smell

223
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,520
- that's about seven times stronger than a bloodhound.
- All right.

224
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,320
'Casey thinks the bears will stay in this area for a while

225
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,400
'to make the most of the early green shoots.

226
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,000
'So for us, it's a waiting game.'

227
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,960
It's amazing cos they just come out of nowhere.

228
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,400
In that deep sagebrush,

229
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,800
they love to just get down out of this wind

230
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,440
and lay there, flat to the ground, cuddle up, keep each other warm.

231
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,840
So we just got to... to keep scanning.

232
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,520
You'll see like a little ear or they'll stretch their paw up.

233
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,960
Yeah, look for those little subtle things popping out.

234
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,000
What makes you think that this is a good spot for bears?

235
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Look right down here in this... green patch.

236
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,640
You'll see where the bears have been excavating there

237
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,000
and that's just classic in the springtime,

238
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
they'll find these first really green spots,

239
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,080
they've got a lot of moisture, get a lot of sun.

240
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,720
So there has been a lot of activity down in that meadow there, so...

241
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,520
there's a really good chance that... whoever did that,

242
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,000
whatever bears did that are going to come back to that spot

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,240
and do it again.

244
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,520
But plants contain less than half the protein of meat.

245
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,040
So they'll have to eat huge amounts to keep up their calorie count.

246
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,440
- CASEY WHISTLES 
- Hey, hey...

247
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
Where?

248
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,600
Right-right... Right down in the trees.

249
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,480
Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

250
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
Three bears.

251
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,040
HE LAUGHS

252
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,880
One... Two...

253
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,000
Three. And there's like...

254
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,200
Like a... Looks like a big female.

255
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,360
One light cub, one dark cub.

256
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,760
- It's pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

257
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,880
Those look like two-year-old cubs.

258
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,120
Being in this area just draws in females with cubs.

259
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,640
Spot like that, well, you know,

260
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,760
we've got dandelions, grasses and sedge.

261
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,160
Even biscuitroot will grow in that area

262
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,720
and that's all on the menu

263
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,160
for a grizzly bear this time of year, so...

264
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,640
They come right to that spot and they'll keep coming back,

265
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,880
over and over and over again, till everything's gone.

266
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,360
So, basically, this area here

267
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,240
is kind of like an all-you-can-eat veggie buffet?

268
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,120
Yeah, it's a salad bar.

269
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,040
A dandelion plant only contains about three calories,

270
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,320
and grass...even less.

271
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,320
The early thaw is at least helping.

272
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,480
But they must find two fields every day with rich sources of food,

273
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,560
like this one, if they're going to survive.

274
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,320
It's not just grizzly bears

275
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,960
that must exploit the best pockets of food.

276
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,960
The Rocky Mountain elk are still moving north following the green-up.

277
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,320
And another of Yellowstone's residents is ahead of them...

278
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,720
the bison.

279
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
This year, the bison and elk are lucky.

280
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
Not only have they had a milder winter,

281
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,680
but the early thaw means there's plenty of grass around.

282
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,360
And now in spring, it's full of protein.

283
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
I've come to the Northern Range of Yellowstone.

284
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Park biologists have reported

285
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,120
that a large herd of bison

286
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,760
has come here to feast

287
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,160
because this year

288
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,280
the snow has already melted.

289
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,320
The park is home to about 5,000 bison.

290
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,240
BISON GROWLS

291
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,160
This herd has made it through to spring fit and strong,

292
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,960
which is crucial for the survival of their newborn calves.

293
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,920
Calving season is just beginning here in Yellowstone National Park.

294
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,120
This is the very first one I've seen. It's suckling, I think.

295
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,040
A quarter of the baby bison in Yellowstone

296
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,360
die in their first two months,

297
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,320
but this mild weather will give them a much greater chance of survival.

298
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,760
There's a tiny one, looks like it's probably only a day or two old.

299
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,160
Beautiful, you can see that lovely chestnutty colour.

300
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,080
They're extraordinary, bison calves.

301
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,000
Within half an hour of being born, they're up on their feet

302
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,680
and within an hour or two, they can run to keep up with their mothers.

303
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,000
BISON GROWLS

304
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,800
Sticking close to their mothers is vital.

305
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,160
Because this spring, Yellowstone's top predator is particularly hungry.

306
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,160
There are 100 wolves in Yellowstone National Park.

307
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,680
They rely on bison and elk to survive the winter.

308
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,520
But whilst the mild winter has been good for the bison,

309
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
it's been bad for the wolves.

310
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,240
They've struggled to hunt.

311
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Back in the winter, biologist Doug Smith

312
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,520
observed the problem first-hand.

313
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,560
Doug and his team monitor these wolves every single day.

314
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
They've noted that whilst mild winters help the prey,

315
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
they put predators at a disadvantage.

316
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,160
When you're in ankle-deep snow, or just elbow-deep snow,

317
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,240
a healthy elk, bison, deer will always outrun a healthy wolf.

318
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,000
Wolves and elk run at the same speed,

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,640
but elk are built for endurance -

320
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,200
with sure footing, they can keep going for longer.

321
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,440
So this winter, the wolves have been going hungry.

322
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,600
They're having a particularly tough time here in the Northern Range,

323
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,200
where five packs compete for food and territory.

324
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,760
Doug has studied these wolves for over 20 years

325
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,560
and in the last decade,

326
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,000
their numbers have fallen dramatically.

327
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,680
One pack, known by park biologists as the Lamar Canyon Pack,

328
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,240
is extremely weak.

329
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,520
If they don't gain strength quickly,

330
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,680
they risk losing their territory to other wolves.

331
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,800
Our wildlife camera team is down in the Lamar Valley following them.

332
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,760
From a mile off, they spot some unusual behaviour.

333
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,680
The wolves are taking on a whole herd of bison.

334
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,360
They're hoping to snatch a newborn calf.

335
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,040
This is a sign that the pack is desperate.

336
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,600
Doug is helping us to analyse what's going on.

337
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,080
These bison are doing classic defence.

338
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,000
They're grouped together, they're big.

339
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,640
They're not moving other than to attack the wolves.

340
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,560
This is an age-old dance between power and agility.

341
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,680
Wolves may be quick, but bison are strong.

342
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,200
Getting this close risks a kick to the skull.

343
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,520
Wolves would like to spread this group apart,

344
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,800
break it up and then that would free up one of these calves

345
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,640
that they could grab.

346
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,920
A female charges, threatening to lash them with her hooves.

347
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,000
You get caught by a foot, you get caught by a horn - injury, death.

348
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,920
It's fascinating footage to watch.

349
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,160
Uh, they're being aggressive, yet very careful.

350
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,920
Wolves definitely feel safer pursuing a fleeing prey

351
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,360
cos they can kind of come in from behind, grab and pull down.

352
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,680
To attack a standing herd means these wolves are desperate.

353
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,320
As they get hungry and it goes more days without food,

354
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,760
they're going to take more risks.

355
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,720
They finally close in.

356
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,280
This is the break in the herd they've been hoping for.

357
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,560
ADULT BISON GRUNTS, WOLVES WHINE

358
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,920
The mother can't do all this by herself, the wolves outnumber her.

359
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,160
They may get this calf, I can't believe this, you rarely see this.

360
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,320
ADULT BISON GRUNTS

361
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,320
But the calf makes it back to the safety of the herd...

362
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,960
..leaving nine very hungry wolves.

363
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,960
The Lamar Canyon Pack has failed.

364
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,360
Doug is concerned that these warmer winters and early springs

365
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,440
are part of a worrying trend.

366
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,960
We can see climate change affecting the park now, um...

367
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
Our wolf research has only been going a little over 20 years,

368
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,400
but you talk to people who were in Yellowstone 40 or 50 years ago,

369
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,960
and winter severity is just not like it used to be,

370
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
and this is a big factor in how this system works.

371
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,880
This winter and last winter were two of our...shortest winters we've had.

372
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,320
This, in a way, in a big picture way, favours the bison.

373
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,200
So we lost our snow at low elevation very early this year

374
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,440
and so any time the snow goes away, it gives the bison better footing...

375
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,560
Uh, they can deal with the wolves,

376
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,600
and secondly, it exposes the vegetation to sunlight.

377
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,440
The condition of bison will start to improve earlier, uh,

378
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,360
and so that hurts the wolves a little bit.

379
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,000
And so sitting aside and watching life evolve with that going on,

380
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,720
uh, has got me scared stiff.

381
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,240
It's the rate of climate change that Doug and his fellow scientists

382
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,520
find so shocking.

383
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,400
Temperatures here have been rising fast.

384
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,640
And the last decade has been the warmest since records began.

385
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,760
With Yellowstone's winters becoming shorter

386
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,240
and the spring starting earlier,

387
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,520
one animal in particular is extremely vulnerable.

388
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,160
The great grey owl.

389
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,880
These owls live in some of the coldest forests on Earth,

390
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,560
from Siberia to Scandinavia.

391
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,520
Yellowstone is just about cold enough for the owls to survive,

392
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,400
but if it gets any warmer,

393
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,680
scientists believe they won't be able to hold on.

394
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,680
Back in winter, cameraman Jeff Hogan

395
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,200
followed a pair of great grey owls in the Teton Mountains.

396
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,440
Great grey owls rely on small rodents like voles and gophers,

397
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,800
which live beneath the snow.

398
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,360
But owl biologists believe that the changing climate

399
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,520
is affecting their hunting.

400
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,120
These owls have to bust through this crust

401
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,280
and then maybe another foot of snow to get at their prey.

402
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,040
But erratic winter weather caused the crust to melt and then refreeze,

403
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,760
making it impenetrable for the owls.

404
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,920
And if they can't hunt, great grey owls won't nest or lay eggs.

405
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,360
Now it's spring,

406
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,640
Jeff has been searching for owl chicks in the Beartooth Mountains.

407
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,720
The forest here is 300 years old

408
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,960
and ideal habitat for great grey owls.

409
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,760
- There they are, three of 'em. 
- Oh, wow!

410
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
OWL SCREECHES

411
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh, my goodness.

412
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,840
The smaller one, she's the runt.

413
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,360
Despite the difficulties of winter, we found a nest with three chicks.

414
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,080
This is extremely unusual.

415
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,240
When food is scarce, the smallest chick can be eaten by its siblings,

416
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,600
but this runt is still alive.

417
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,200
How much of a success is it

418
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,360
that we've got three great grey owl chicks here?

419
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,280
In these parts here, this neck of the woods,

420
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,280
- it's about a 20% success rate for the third chick.
- Mm.

421
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,200
So most, you know,

422
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,920
four out of five perish by this... by this time.

423
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,440
So we've got some great parents here?

424
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,080
Yeah, the reason is our winters have been quite mild,

425
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,920
so the rodents, the prey, has really benefited

426
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,880
and their populations have really grown,

427
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,160
which of course then benefits the owls.

428
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,040
And that could be making the difference

429
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,560
on whether that third chick survives or not.

430
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,960
The early thaw this year has turned the owls' fortunes around.

431
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,120
The milder weather has led to a boom in rodent numbers.

432
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,440
To reveal how this has been helping the owls,

433
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,040
Jeff has been searching for their pellets.

434
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,560
Yeah, I've got a pellet here I collected this morning.

435
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,920
And, look, you'll see the size of this...

436
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,560
- It's kind of... 
- PATRICK LAUGHS

437
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,760
It's kind of disgusting.

438
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,520
OK, well, if I just break this apart...

439
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,400
Well, you can see, it is literally just...

440
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,440
..hair and bone.

441
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,480
Yeah.

442
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,080
- GASPING:
- Look at that!

443
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,320
That is an entire skull.

444
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,720
- Look at that, you can even see the teeth!
- Mm-hm.

445
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
Oh! Here we go, look, look, look, look!

446
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,240
- There you go.
- Oh, that is brilliant.

447
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,280
Yeah.

448
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,120
A second skull,

449
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,200
which means they would have had two meals in quick succession.

450
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,960
So far, the owls are doing well,

451
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,800
but spring in Yellowstone is unpredictable.

452
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,000
After I leave, the weather takes a turn for the worse.

453
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,240
A storm blows in.

454
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,560
It could mean death for the chicks.

455
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,520
This rain makes...makes it a little more difficult for me...

456
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,000
to work in, but...

457
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
..it makes it even more difficult for the adult owls to hunt,

458
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,080
being that it's just so noisy,

459
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
and that masks any sounds that the rodents may be making.

460
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,480
The runt is at the bottom of the pecking order.

461
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,760
As soon as food becomes scarce, she'll be the first to lose out.

462
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,320
If the weather doesn't change, the runt may starve.

463
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,840
THUNDER RUMBLES

464
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,800
May is always the wettest month of the year in Yellowstone.

465
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,240
But this year, it's far wetter than average.

466
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,360
The reason can be found in the Pacific.

467
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,080
The warming ocean creates much more moisture in the air.

468
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,000
This is channelled directly up to Yellowstone.

469
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,040
And when it hits the wall of mountains,

470
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,560
the fury of the monsoon is unleashed.

471
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,720
THUNDER RUMBLES

472
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,600
We experience the most violent storm that's been seen here

473
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,960
for many years.

474
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Rain falling over three mountain ranges

475
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,320
drains straight into the Yellowstone basin.

476
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,800
Overnight, water levels rise by a foot.

477
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,600
For two weeks,

478
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,400
rain pours down and thunderstorms reverberate around the mountains.

479
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,720
Then, at last, in early June...

480
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,120
..the weather breaks.

481
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,920
But there's water everywhere.

482
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,640
Melting snow, as well as rainwater,

483
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,520
is now flowing into the river systems.

484
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,040
Scientists have told me to come to Yellowstone Falls

485
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,160
to see the full effect.

486
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,960
Back in March, Yellowstone Falls was just a mere trickle,

487
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,840
and now it's a dramatic torrent of tumbling water.

488
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,720
Every year the thaw is different

489
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,120
and it's the rivers that hold the clues

490
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,320
to tell us how this year's thaw is progressing.

491
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,600
Thousands of animals rely on this river to survive.

492
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,120
Greater Yellowstone sits on the Continental Divide.

493
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,680
This water flows west to the Pacific Ocean and east to the Atlantic.

494
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,520
Without this huge reservoir of water,

495
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,440
agriculture and industry, as well as wildlife in the American West,

496
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,360
would die.

497
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,920
So understanding how MUCH water is draining into the river systems

498
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,200
is vital.

499
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,840
Teams of scientists

500
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,960
have monitored the streamflow in Yellowstone's rivers

501
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,240
for the last 86 years.

502
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,960
They've noticed that recently the pattern of the spring runoff

503
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,560
has been changing.

504
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,680
This piece of equipment measures streamflow.

505
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,400
Hydrologist Cheryl Miller is keeping a close eye on the rising water

506
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,680
in the Yellowstone River.

507
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,880
The data she gathers will reveal how big the spring runoff will be.

508
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,840
It's all done with this little orange boat

509
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,000
that uses sonar to measure the depth and speed of the water.

510
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,840
Combine those and you get the flow, and that's the key figure.

511
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,080
The rain has already raised the water levels,

512
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,320
but it's the thousands of tonnes of snow still in the mountains

513
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,360
that will make the real difference.

514
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,480
- OK, I've got it.
- All right.

515
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,120
So, if you do get a very sharp rise in temperature,

516
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,480
if that snow pattern melts very quickly...

517
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,760
And, I mean, you know, I've been in that snow pattern,

518
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,160
the snow was above my head.

519
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,920
Presumably, if that DOES melt very quickly,

520
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,440
the results downstream must be potentially quite dramatic,

521
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,400
quite-quite destructive.

522
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,800
Indeed. High energy floods can make great changes along the river.

523
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,880
What's happening now is the days are warm, but that more importantly,

524
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,480
the nights are warmer,

525
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,960
and so that snow pack never refreezes at night.

526
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,040
It continues to slowly melt during the night

527
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,480
and so that's what allows the snowmelt and the runoff

528
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,760
- to accelerate during this time of year.
- Yeah.

529
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,600
Just looking at the river,

530
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,440
does it appear that the flow is faster now than it was

531
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,760
when you last collected data?

532
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,360
It is, it has come up in the last three or four days that it's...

533
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,840
It may not be a lot faster, but the volume is definitely bigger,

534
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,560
there's more streamflow than there was just a few days ago.

535
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,800
Cheryl's data reveals this year the melting snow

536
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,240
is coming off the mountains more quickly than usual.

537
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,240
The faster it runs off, the less water is absorbed into the ground.

538
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,480
These rapid spring melts are more likely to cause flash floods.

539
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,520
Patrick's finding out how that's affecting the beavers.

540
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,040
Here in the Snake River Valley,

541
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,720
all the meltwater from the Tetons is running down the mountains

542
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,680
and it's headed directly for our beaver dam.

543
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,080
'I'm meeting up with cameraman Charlie Hamilton James.'

544
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,480
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Patrick.

545
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,960
- How's it going, man?
- Yeah, it's good. Lovely weather, isn't it?

546
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,240
'He's spent the last week

547
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,880
'watching the beavers struggle with the rising river.'

548
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,720
The water level is so much higher

549
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,160
compared to the last time I was here.

550
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,840
Yeah, actually, really only in the last few days.

551
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,160
- There was a lot of rain.
- All of that water has resulted in this?

552
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,400
Yeah, and what it's done,

553
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,120
- it's actually starting to flood the dam.
- Mm.

554
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,120
In some places, the dam has already breached.

555
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,040
The beavers are working nonstop to make sure all the leaks are plugged.

556
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,280
They built this dam five years ago and every year they fortify it.

557
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,960
This one's been strengthened with a particularly high number of stones.

558
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,040
So what makes this spot prime habitat?

559
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,800
Well, actually, weirdly, beavers have made this spot.

560
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,040
This actually started life as a stream

561
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,200
and it's the beavers that came along and stuck these dams in it

562
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,040
and blocked its path and created these long, slow ponds,

563
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,560
and when you create a pond, you create another pond,

564
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,840
you create another pond... You create a wetland ecosystem.

565
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,400
They're basically engineers, but they're also gardeners.

566
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,520
I like that, gardeners.

567
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,320
So they're creating this whole environment that suits THEM.

568
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,560
But it's not just them that benefit from this, right?

569
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,040
- You've got amphibians, other mammals...
- Oh, absolutely.

570
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,520
..birds that rely on this.

571
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,200
I mean, just sitting here now, there's birds everywhere.

572
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
You know, swallows flying round,

573
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,040
drinking and catching flies off the surface.

574
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,720
There's kingfishers eating fish.

575
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,040
There's lots of minnows here,

576
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,960
lots of small fish perfect for kingfishers.

577
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Otters come through here, ospreys, eagles...

578
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,360
So, you know, they're ecosystem builders, is what they are, beavers

579
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,880
and more so, really, than any other animal.

580
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,280
If the main dam is knocked out,

581
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,320
it's not just the beavers that will lose their home.

582
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,640
The top is just about holding.

583
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,000
But Charlie and I are heading underwater

584
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,360
to find out how solid the base is.

585
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,680
Just where my feet are now, it actually starts here.

586
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,520
These... The foundations have been laid here.

587
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,760
So, you know, it's like ten foot wide.

588
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,840
You can't see it all cos, you know, most of it's underwater.

589
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,560
We've got these drysuits on.

590
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,840
Yeah, and really, Patrick, in the spirit of full immersion...

591
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,000
..we should go in and actually have a look.

592
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,760
- Is this where I find out I've got the dud suit?
- Yeah.

593
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,400
Actually, this is so much better than I thought it would be.

594
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,560
This is awesome!

595
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,360
It's much clearer than I thought, you can really see it.

596
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,600
It's only when you get underwater that you see the skill

597
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,320
that's gone into building this dam.

598
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,440
The beavers choose logs up to two metres long...

599
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,480
..and place them at an angle of 30 degrees to hold back the water.

600
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,400
This is precision engineering.

601
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,520
This is amazing, isn't it?

602
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,720
It's so impressive.

603
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,720
This is, you know, it's-it's kind of a work of art.

604
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,600
But the beavers' hard work may not be enough.

605
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,400
If the river rises any further, the water could break through.

606
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,880
And this watery world might just disappear.

607
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,680
It's getting cold now, innit?

608
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,000
THEY CHATTER

609
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,600
It's now mid-June and temperatures reach 28 degrees...

610
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,400
Seven degrees above average

611
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,960
for this time of year.

612
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,760
The snow recedes halfway up the mountains...

613
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,240
revealing the highest feeding grounds in Greater Yellowstone.

614
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,800
And close behind are all the animals

615
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,960
taking advantage of the final stage of this year's spring green-up.

616
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,520
At 2,500 metres,

617
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,000
this vast wilderness provides food for thousands of animals.

618
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,880
Elk that overwintered down in the valleys,

619
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,160
finally arrive back in these high pastures,

620
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,960
where they'll raise their calves.

621
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,760
These meadows are a feasting ground, full to the brim with wildlife...

622
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,840
the hunters as well as the hunted.

623
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,760
Opportunistic black bears take advantage of a low bird's nest

624
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,160
and defenceless chicks.

625
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,560
At this time of year, any food is fair game.

626
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,640
The grizzly bears are also joining the feeding frenzy.

627
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,960
I'm catching up with Casey,

628
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,040
who's following the fortunes of one young bear family.

629
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,600
These newborn cubs are only four months old.

630
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,760
With nowhere to hide from predators,

631
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,440
this meadow is a dangerous place for baby bears.

632
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,440
But their mother has no choice.

633
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,760
She's following the melting snow to make sure that both she and her cubs

634
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,600
get enough protein from the new growth.

635
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,600
- CASEY CHUCKLES 
- Aw, they're so cute!

636
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,200
So small.

637
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,640
So, you know this bear?

638
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,560
Yeah, you can count on her like clockwork.

639
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,320
Everything that a little cub needs to learn to survive its lifetime,

640
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,840
they're learning in these first few years with its mother.

641
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,520
Like where to go, what time of the year, how to dig the roots.

642
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,240
They're learning all of that right now.

643
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,160
This one here, you know, the year after year that I've watched her,

644
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,200
she usually keeps almost all of her cubs.

645
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,640
She's a great mother.

646
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,000
In the ten years that Casey's been following this female,

647
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,160
he's also seen her teach her offspring a more gruesome skill.

648
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,480
She's a known predator.

649
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,760
During this time of year,

650
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,320
she'll actually go around looking for elk calves that were just born,

651
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,160
that are stashed out here in the sagebrush

652
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,760
and these little cubs will be in tow, and they'll be watching.

653
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,600
So it's a very learned behaviour

654
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,920
and some bears, right in the same area, don't hunt elk calves at all,

655
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,440
cos their mother didn't teach 'em.

656
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,200
They didn't get the chance to learn this.

657
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,000
These little guys are going to learn that

658
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,680
and I'll tell you, at this time of year,

659
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,600
- that protein for these little bear cubs is essential...
- Mm-hm.

660
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,280
..and that may just be the thing

661
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,520
that gives them the advantage to be strong bears.

662
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,520
But of all the survival skills they'll need to learn,

663
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,680
the most important is how to spot danger.

664
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,040
Now, we've got Mum in the middle of this sagebrush

665
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,360
and these little cubs bobbing their head up and down.

666
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:03,000
Surely, you know, this is, this is a dangerous time for them as well.

667
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,600
How difficult is it, you know, to be a newborn grizzly bear cub?

668
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,440
Very difficult. Stats say about 50% of bear cubs in their first year,

669
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,880
they don't make it.

670
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,200
And there are so many things out there that are trying to kill them.

671
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,760
A male grizzly's one of them.

672
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,720
You know, a male grizzly knows that

673
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,760
she won't mate as long as she has cubs.

674
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,960
If he comes in there and he can eliminate those cubs,

675
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,320
then she will come into oestrus and she will mate.

676
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,680
So... Big male bears - big danger for these guys.

677
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,000
Male grizzlies are known to roam this area,

678
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,520
so their mother must stay on high alert.

679
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,600
And what's that scar on her head?

680
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,480
It looks like she's got some sort of scar.

681
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,040
Yeah, it's new for her,

682
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,160
so I'm assuming now that she's got these little cubs,

683
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,800
that scar is probably from protecting them against a big male.

684
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,640
And when it comes to that defence, these females, they don't care.

685
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,000
They're going to go against the biggest male grizzly

686
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,240
and it looks like she probably protected her cubs,

687
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,040
but came away with a pretty big scar.

688
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,280
Oh, she's nursing right now.

689
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,040
She's laying on her back.

690
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,280
- Oh, yeah...
- Yeah, they're just going to get in there,

691
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,640
they're going to relax.

692
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,000
Nothing better for a little cub than that right there,

693
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,400
but Mum... she still has to pay attention.

694
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,160
And you can see, she'll just keep picking her head up and watching,

695
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,200
looking for danger.

696
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,360
There's a good chance these two little dudes will grow up to be adult bears.

697
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,640
And she's... She's a rock star mum, for sure.

698
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,520
Bears spend the heat of the day

699
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,920
bedded down in the shade of the forest.

700
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,880
But before this mother takes her cubs back to the woods,

701
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,440
she has one more trick to teach them -

702
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,920
how to keep cool in the hot sun.

703
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,400
These little patches of snow

704
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,600
that are left from the snowdrifts in the winter

705
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,440
are everything for these bears,

706
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,320
cos it's really their AC unit, cos the hotter it gets...

707
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,920
They really seek out these snowfields

708
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,000
just to go and lay their bellies on and cool down.

709
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,160
CASEY LAUGHS

710
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,560
That's the best thing, they're so playful, so full of energy, just...

711
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,680
They'll roll around like that for hours.

712
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,080
You know, they're using that snow like a slip and slide,

713
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,960
just like kids playing on toboggans and sleds.

714
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,680
They're starting to learn how to use their claws and their paws

715
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,960
and get their balance.

716
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,800
If you look around out here, I mean, this is a pretty rugged terrain,

717
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,160
so they'd better get their feet underneath them pretty quick.

718
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,240
I really believe that they like to have fun, just like any kid.

719
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,000
But these snowy playgrounds will soon disappear

720
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,320
as temperatures are now climbing every day.

721
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,800
In late June, we hit 30 degrees.

722
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,560
The snowpack is collapsing.

723
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,120
The great Yellowstone thaw reaches its peak.

724
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,000
Thousands of tonnes of meltwater cascade through the canyons...

725
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,200
..bulldozing everything in their path

726
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,000
and crashes on into the valleys.

727
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,080
Over 250 cubic metres of water

728
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,760
is passing through the river per second.

729
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,160
This meltwater is vital for the regeneration of the land.

730
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,840
But it comes at a cost.

731
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,640
Despite the floodwater,

732
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,200
Yellowstone's residents have to continue

733
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,080
their daily quest to find food.

734
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,440
Biologists have just told us that a herd of bison

735
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,480
is attempting a river crossing not far from Yellowstone Falls.

736
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,880
BISON GROWLS

737
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,760
Our camera team arrives

738
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,760
to find a two-month-old bison calf already struggling.

739
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,840
It's been swept away from its mother.

740
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,960
BISON BLEATS

741
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,600
Without her body to shield it,

742
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,440
the calf is pounded by the full force of the current.

743
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,920
The other females have their own young to protect.

744
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,040
This one is on its own.

745
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,320
And it's losing energy fast.

746
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,240
BISON GRUNTS

747
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,240
But the exhausted calf makes it safely

748
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,080
to the new pastures on the other side.

749
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
This one is lucky.

750
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,640
And further south, the Snake River is also running high.

751
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,440
There's so much floodwater that one of the beavers' dams has burst.

752
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,560
Yeah, this is up, isn't it?

753
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,680
Look at that. I mean, it's just... It's just blown out, hasn't it?

754
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,360
Wow. Yeah, that is completely busted.

755
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,280
- Yeah.
- You know, that water's flow...

756
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,720
And it's a lot faster as well.

757
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,720
Do you know what? You're not going to stop this.

758
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,600
The river's got to come down here, hasn't it?

759
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,520
It'll either bust through the dam or it'll go over the top of the dam, or it'll go around the dam.

760
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,200
- Yeah.
- And this dam just obviously wasn't quite strong enough, it's just bust through it.

761
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,560
And, you know, when this dam busts, it can take out the next dam.

762
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,960
- You know? It's a kind of domino effect.
- Right.

763
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,680
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's just...

764
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,640
That is strong. So there's no way this can...

765
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,920
you know, a pile of sticks is going to stop this.

766
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,640
Are they even going to bother to fix that bit?

767
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,120
No, I don't think they will because...

768
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,520
Well, actually, you know, it'd be impossible to fix it.

769
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,760
- Yeah.
- They're going to... I reckon they'll wait and in a month maybe

770
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,920
or more, until the water goes right back down to pre-flood level,

771
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,880
then they'll build it back up.

772
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,760
You know, it doesn't look like much when you look upstream,

773
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,200
but right here,

774
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,800
all this water is pushing up against my body and there's so much force,

775
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,320
and that's what the dam is having to contend with,

776
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,280
that's what it's trying to hold back.

777
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,200
If this dam has bust...

778
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,880
..what's happened to the beavers?

779
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,200
The beavers are busier than ever.

780
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,240
The water is flowing right over the top of their dam.

781
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,520
But at the moment, it's still holding.

782
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,240
They won't be able to fix it until the water levels fall.

783
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,040
Inside the lodge, all the old bedding is pushed into the water.

784
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,720
They leave it to soak for a while...

785
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,120
and when it's clean, they drag it back in...

786
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,400
giving them fresh new bedding for the summer.

787
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,440
With temperatures now reaching 30 degrees,

788
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,480
the owl chicks are struggling.

789
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,680
One has already left the nest.

790
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,240
These are birds that thrive in colder temperatures,

791
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,440
but their nest is now exposed to the full force of the sun.

792
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,040
Great grey owls struggle to lose heat,

793
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,160
so the remaining two chicks must leave the nest

794
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,760
as quickly as they can.

795
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,200
The second chick is getting up on the lip,

796
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,640
on the highest point of the nest and just flaps like crazy.

797
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,360
He's looking over the edge

798
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,000
and this is what they do before they jump.

799
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,760
But the chicks are vulnerable.

800
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,720
Their wings aren't strong enough to fly.

801
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,000
When they jump, they'll plummet ten metres to the forest floor.

802
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,280
Oh, he's going to go, he's going to go! Jump, jump!

803
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,920
Go, go, go, go! Oh!

804
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,240
He's leaning way over on the other edge.

805
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,720
He could go any second.

806
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,080
It's the riskiest moment of this owl's life.

807
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,360
It's not the most graceful maiden flight,

808
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,920
but it's success nonetheless.

809
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,080
He's hanging upside down!

810
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,680
Got it all messed up.

811
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,120
Oh, he is struggling.

812
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,760
He's hanging by one talon.

813
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,560
There he goes!

814
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,040
It's one thing to launch, it's another thing to land.

815
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,120
The chick lands safely,

816
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,400
but it must head straight back up into the tree tops,

817
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,560
away from predators on the forest floor.

818
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,160
With Yellowstone's climate getting warmer each year,

819
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,360
these owls may not be able to live here for much longer.

820
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,560
Summer temperatures are becoming too hot.

821
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,640
She doesn't know what to do or where to go.

822
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,400
The runt is now in danger.

823
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,080
She's being struck directly by the intense heat of the sun.

824
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,840
In these conditions,

825
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,840
great grey owls struggle to regulate their body temperature.

826
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,600
Panting helps her to cool down.

827
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,640
But her downy feathers, which are so efficient in cold weather,

828
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,400
may prove fatal.

829
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,480
CHICK CHIRPS

830
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,040
Our little girl's up again.

831
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,160
Finally, but...

832
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,400
She's hot too. She... She wants out of there. I can tell.

833
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,400
This is a leap of faith she has GOT to make.

834
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,680
She's back on the launch pad.

835
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,840
This is where I think she's going to go.

836
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,320
She's...

837
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,920
She launched! She launched!

838
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,160
CHICK CHIRPS

839
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,680
So this forest is now home to three more great grey owls.

840
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,920
I'm impressed. I'm proud of this little girl.

841
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,840
You know, maybe one day she's going to just come back here

842
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,440
and raise a great grey owl family of her own.

843
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,680
As the longest day of the year approaches, spring becomes summer.

844
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,200
The animals we've followed

845
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,720
have made it through Yellowstone's most challenging season.

846
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,160
This year, the thaw started three weeks earlier than usual.

847
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,280
An area of 30,000 square miles has been transformed...

848
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,720
..and the mountains have released over a million tonnes of water.

849
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:20,680
And finally, from top to bottom, Yellowstone is free of snow.

850
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,080
Now our animal families face the new challenge of summer,

851
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,160
when temperatures can soar and vegetation wither.

852
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,920
And that leads to a new threat -

853
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,640
wildfires.

854
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,720
Tomorrow night, we bring you summer,

855
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,720
when soaring temperatures force the animals of Yellowstone

856
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,640
to change their behaviour.

857
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,440
Bears enter cowboy country as they search for food.

858
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,320
The wolves display unusual hunting strategies

859
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,960
to keep their 11 pups alive.

860
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,520
And the beavers flee from their lodge

861
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,400
in a dramatic twist to life in this changing environment.
