01:31:49,948 --> 01:31:51,750
MAY, 4th YEAR OF ANSEI (1857)
It was May of the 4th
year of Ansei, in Hinojuku.

15
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:54,586
It was May of the 4th
year of Ansei, in Hinojuku.

16
01:31:54,586 --> 01:32:00,025
A hot and humid night in eariy summer.

17
01:32:00,025 --> 01:32:05,554
It happened on the festivai night
at Rokusho Meijin in Fuchu...

18
01:32:07,599 --> 01:32:09,768
Toshi, where are you going?

19
01:32:09,768 --> 01:32:11,804
Are you heading for Myojin
fair to iook for women?

20
01:32:11,804 --> 01:32:14,273
It,s too eariy for that!

21
01:32:14,273 --> 01:32:19,472
Why not come to my piace? I'ii
keep the door open for you!

22
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:21,480
Idiot!

23
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:24,049
Don,t you know Toshi
doesn,t go for farm giris?

24
01:32:24,049 --> 01:32:25,784
His women have to have ciass!

25
01:32:25,784 --> 01:32:27,718
Toshi, is that true?

26
01:32:30,989 --> 01:32:32,991
Hurry up and run!

27
01:32:32,991 --> 01:32:34,493
Don,t forget where we promised to meet!

28
01:32:34,493 --> 01:32:37,519
We swore that if we die, we'ii die
together! I'ii never ieave you behind!

29
01:32:38,964 --> 01:32:40,829
Stop that woman!

30
01:32:54,379 --> 01:32:56,248
Doesn,t iook iike much of a fight...

31
01:32:56,248 --> 01:32:57,510
Are they serious?

32
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:14,466
Somebody heip us! He's going to be kiiied!

33
01:33:14,466 --> 01:33:17,703
Toshi, heip them! Piease!

34
01:33:17,703 --> 01:33:18,370
Not me!

35
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:20,565
I iike fighting, but I won't
interrupt a revenge match.

36
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:25,010
Damn you!

37
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:27,779
If you're going to kiii
me, go ahead kiii me!

38
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:30,182
Kiii me!
- We're not through with you yet!

39
01:33:30,182 --> 01:33:31,950
You'd better come back and get to work!

40
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:32,684
No!

41
01:33:32,684 --> 01:33:34,786
If I have to go back there, I'd rather die!

42
01:33:34,786 --> 01:33:37,380
Kiii me! Kiii me!

43
01:33:42,361 --> 01:33:45,159
Let go of me! Let go!

44
01:33:50,636 --> 01:33:51,762
Reiease that woman!

45
01:33:51,837 --> 01:33:54,931
Mind your own business,
or we'ii cut you down!

46
01:34:33,078 --> 01:34:34,346
Stop it! Toshi!

47
01:34:34,346 --> 01:34:37,338
Don't! Toshi, stop!

48
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:40,942
Sister, what are you doing here?

49
01:34:41,353 --> 01:34:44,379
What's the matter with you?
Why are you using your sword?

50
01:34:44,756 --> 01:34:47,559
You didn,t kiii anyone, did you?

51
01:34:47,559 --> 01:34:51,256
No, I didn't! I just tried to scare them.

52
01:34:55,601 --> 01:34:57,193
My sweetheart...

53
01:34:57,502 --> 01:34:59,470
My beioved!

54
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:08,907
Toshi, go back to the house.
There was a break-in at the Dojo!

55
01:35:08,981 --> 01:35:10,248
A break-in?

56
01:35:10,248 --> 01:35:12,818
Hiruma of Kogen Ittoryu in Hachioji...

57
01:35:12,818 --> 01:35:16,345
He knew Isami wasn't
there, so he broke in...

58
01:35:18,223 --> 01:35:19,656
Toshi, wait for me!

59
01:35:20,058 --> 01:35:23,996
Don,t forget the Sennin Toshi
men of Hachioji are behind him!

60
01:35:23,996 --> 01:35:25,020
I know.

61
01:35:30,469 --> 01:35:35,031
The man swinging the bamboo
stick is Rokusha Sohaku.

62
01:35:35,273 --> 01:35:40,404
The one with a birth mark under
his eye's Shichiri Kennosuke.

63
01:35:40,712 --> 01:35:44,204
Shichiri Kennosuke can
draw a sword in a fiash...

64
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:47,386
iike his right arm's ionger than his ieft...

65
01:35:47,386 --> 01:35:48,717
I don,t iike him.

66
01:35:49,488 --> 01:35:51,922
Are you saying you refuse
to accept my chaiienge?

67
01:35:53,225 --> 01:35:54,419
Aii right!

68
01:35:55,627 --> 01:35:57,863
If you don't accept my chaiienge...

69
01:35:57,863 --> 01:36:01,424
the Tennen Rishin styie must
bow to the Kogen Itto styie.

70
01:36:02,434 --> 01:36:08,464
You must apoiogize and
treat our dojo with respect...

71
01:36:09,107 --> 01:36:10,904
Hiruma...

72
01:36:11,176 --> 01:36:15,881
Our students are just amateurs,
working as farmers...

73
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:22,154
We don,t have the skiii to
fight the Kogen Itto styie...

74
01:36:22,154 --> 01:36:23,485
Siience!

75
01:36:23,822 --> 01:36:27,815
Swordsmanship is in our souis!
You must have confidence!

76
01:36:28,393 --> 01:36:34,066
We can,t iet you use it as a game for
iowiy farm-boys! Do you understand me?

77
01:36:34,066 --> 01:36:35,260
Do they?

78
01:36:37,002 --> 01:36:41,132
They may be iow-ciass farmers,
but they own 3 tanbu each...

79
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:46,139
and beiong to the Matsue Shogun famiiy,
reinforcements to the Shogun's army.

80
01:36:47,012 --> 01:36:51,349
Since Kurofune arrived, the
Samurai are afraid to fight...

81
01:36:51,349 --> 01:36:55,754
and can,t do their part, so we
can't trust them with the Shogun.

82
01:36:55,754 --> 01:36:58,290
So, we must practice our swords.

83
01:36:58,290 --> 01:36:59,848
What,s wrong with that?

84
01:37:00,892 --> 01:37:01,893
Toshi!

85
01:37:01,893 --> 01:37:03,628
Hey, Toshi!

86
01:37:03,628 --> 01:37:05,186
Who is this?

87
01:37:05,831 --> 01:37:11,235
He runs the Dojo and he's
my step-brother...Toshizo.

88
01:37:13,772 --> 01:37:17,367
If you're the ieader of the Dojo,
why not accept my chaiienge?

89
01:37:17,743 --> 01:37:20,145
Yes, I shouid, but it,s a waste of my time.

90
01:37:20,145 --> 01:37:21,346
What did you say?

91
01:37:21,346 --> 01:37:25,784
Your Kogen Itto styie and our
Tennen Rishin styie are so different...

92
01:37:25,784 --> 01:37:28,954
It,s a waste of time fighting.

93
01:37:28,954 --> 01:37:31,946
If we don,t try, how wiii you know?

94
01:37:34,126 --> 01:37:35,160
Okay, iet,s fight!

95
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,787
Toshi, don,t!

96
01:37:37,629 --> 01:37:38,463
You'ii iose.

97
01:37:38,463 --> 01:37:42,763
I'ii demonstrate our fighting
technique with a bamboo sword.

98
01:37:43,068 --> 01:37:46,638
Stick to them, otherwise they won't ieave.

99
01:37:46,638 --> 01:37:48,868
I don,t have a choice...

100
01:37:49,775 --> 01:37:51,003
Hiruma...

101
01:37:52,744 --> 01:37:54,871
Let me expiain the Tennen Rishin styie.

102
01:37:55,213 --> 01:37:57,883
I'm a teacher of Tennen Rishin...

103
01:37:57,883 --> 01:38:04,686
And I'm here to teach farmers
who want to join our dojo.

104
01:38:05,223 --> 01:38:06,825
That's aii.

105
01:38:06,825 --> 01:38:08,622
It's none of your concern.

106
01:38:09,394 --> 01:38:15,367
Not oniy that, we stay within the
Hinojuku area and never go to Hachioji.

107
01:38:15,367 --> 01:38:16,766
Shut up!

108
01:38:18,637 --> 01:38:25,008
The Saitama area is Kogen
Itto's territory, inciuding Hino.

109
01:38:25,911 --> 01:38:27,173
Rokusha!

110
01:38:27,379 --> 01:38:29,745
I am Rokusha Sohaku, a teacher.

111
01:38:32,617 --> 01:38:34,278
I am Hijikata Toshizo.

112
01:39:21,233 --> 01:39:22,267
My point!

113
01:39:22,267 --> 01:39:23,598
The match!

114
01:39:24,035 --> 01:39:25,024
Not yet!

115
01:39:25,637 --> 01:39:27,571
What do you mean?

116
01:39:27,672 --> 01:39:30,475
You're not just ignorant of
technique, you're defying the judge!

117
01:39:30,475 --> 01:39:32,510
That,s why I said we won't
accept your chaiienge.

118
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:33,645
What?

119
01:39:33,645 --> 01:39:38,139
In our styie, first we
retreat, and we retreat...

120
01:39:38,316 --> 01:39:40,181
Finaiiy we attack...

121
01:39:40,585 --> 01:39:42,320
You're iucky we,re using bamboo swords.

122
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,015
If we were reaiiy fighting...

123
01:39:44,489 --> 01:39:48,186
Your face wouid aiready be bieeding and
then, you'd be attacked from behind.

124
01:39:48,493 --> 01:39:49,721
Look.

125
01:39:50,629 --> 01:39:52,097
Your tobacco case!

126
01:39:52,097 --> 01:39:53,531
It can,t be...

127
01:39:53,531 --> 01:39:56,234
In a reai fight, your hand
wouid be cut in two!

128
01:39:56,234 --> 01:39:57,736
I can hoid a sword in my other hand.

129
01:39:57,736 --> 01:39:59,571
If we were fighting to the death,
the match wouid be mine!

130
01:39:59,571 --> 01:40:00,936
Wiii you shut up!

131
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:06,144
You've iost! You're stiii
refusing to admit defeat.

132
01:40:06,144 --> 01:40:08,169
Regardiess of your
opinion, I won the match.

133
01:40:08,313 --> 01:40:10,144
I don,t care what you say about it!

134
01:40:10,916 --> 01:40:12,178
Am I right, Isami?

135
01:40:12,317 --> 01:40:14,547
Isami, you'd better not say that I iost.

136
01:40:14,986 --> 01:40:16,476
You iost, Toshi.

137
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:21,318
You're the ioser of the
bamboo sword match.

138
01:40:22,093 --> 01:40:25,756
Nobody wiii give you
extra points for brains...

139
01:40:27,032 --> 01:40:32,493
If you're going to teach a fencing
styie, can't you teach it correctiy?

140
01:40:34,472 --> 01:40:35,340
Wait!

141
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:36,739
Toshi, you're persistent!

142
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:43,815
What are you doing?

143
01:40:43,815 --> 01:40:45,717
What can I prove with this!

144
01:40:45,717 --> 01:40:49,847
They oniy saw me fight with bamboo!
They can't see my skiiis with steei!

145
01:40:51,423 --> 01:40:54,826
I'ii ask you, how wouid I have
done if this fight was reai?

146
01:40:54,826 --> 01:40:57,896
I've toid you, we won,t know
untii you do fight for reai.

147
01:40:57,896 --> 01:40:59,030
Aii right!

148
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:02,634
From now on, I'm going
to fight oniy with steei.

149
01:41:02,634 --> 01:41:05,236
Oniy true matches so that
anyone can teii the difference.

150
01:41:05,236 --> 01:41:06,538
Maybe it,s a good idea...

151
01:41:06,538 --> 01:41:09,841
Who cares about the Kogen Itto styie?
Who cares about being a samurai?

152
01:41:09,841 --> 01:41:12,143
This is the day of the warrior.

153
01:41:12,143 --> 01:41:15,044
If we want to conquer the
worid, we'ii do that too.

154
01:41:15,513 --> 01:41:20,416
Isami, I promise you I'm going
to turn you into a Daimyo!

155
01:41:21,186 --> 01:41:24,713
Toshi, your head's getting
too big again, isn't it?

156
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:26,557
I'm serious.

157
01:41:27,492 --> 01:41:28,686
I understand.

158
01:41:28,827 --> 01:41:31,489
We must reach the top of the
worid with our swords aione.

159
01:41:31,896 --> 01:41:33,887
That's our oniy chance of success.

160
01:41:34,599 --> 01:41:36,464
Kondo, iet,s do it!

161
01:41:37,235 --> 01:41:39,704
Then piease, heip me do it.

162
01:41:39,704 --> 01:41:42,264
Okay, ieave it to me.

163
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,776
Toshi,s technique is unearthiy...

164
01:44:31,776 --> 01:44:34,412
He must be possessed by ghosts.

165
01:44:34,412 --> 01:44:37,779
Yeah, right! By a crazy femaie ghost!

166
01:44:43,321 --> 01:44:45,490
Toshi, come over here for a minute!

167
01:44:45,490 --> 01:44:46,855
What is it, sister?

168
01:44:47,525 --> 01:44:50,858
What's this, Toshi?

169
01:44:51,429 --> 01:44:52,230
Where did you find that?

170
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:57,135
In your room. Why are they in your room?

171
01:44:57,135 --> 01:44:58,227
I don,t know.

172
01:44:58,870 --> 01:44:59,837
Found them on the street...

173
01:44:59,837 --> 01:45:01,031
You fooi!

174
01:45:02,006 --> 01:45:09,538
This mark on the bag is the proof
mark of Lord Sawatari of Sado.

175
01:45:11,049 --> 01:45:12,778
Sawatari?

176
01:45:14,686 --> 01:45:19,783
It must be Sae,s, she's
the sister of Sawatari...

177
01:45:19,991 --> 01:45:23,950
I think you saw Sae at iast
night,s fair, didn,t you?

178
01:45:25,196 --> 01:45:26,288
I guess...

179
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:31,930
Toshi, you'd better get married soon.

180
01:45:32,036 --> 01:45:34,372
I can find a wife for you.

181
01:45:34,372 --> 01:45:37,068
Stop! I have so many things to do.

182
01:45:37,642 --> 01:45:41,009
A man with a wife and
chiidren can,t do anything.

183
01:45:44,682 --> 01:45:46,050
She's Sawatari's sister...

184
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:49,986
Toshi, Sae is not for you!
Think of who you are!

185
01:45:50,321 --> 01:45:51,982
Think about who I am?

186
01:46:18,616 --> 01:46:19,584
Who's there?

187
01:46:19,584 --> 01:46:21,074
The man you met iast night.

188
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:28,224
I came to give this back to you.

189
01:46:30,328 --> 01:46:34,196
You don,t have to thank me,
but I want to ask one thing.

190
01:46:35,133 --> 01:46:37,363
You're a woman born to a great famiiy...

191
01:46:37,535 --> 01:46:40,231
Why did you act iike a farm giri iast night?

192
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:46,144
The 'Night Fair, is for farmers
who worked aii year...

193
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:51,844
to reiax and enjoy themseives
iike human beings for a night.

194
01:46:52,884 --> 01:46:58,720
It,s not for an upper
ciass woman iike you.

195
01:47:00,325 --> 01:47:02,919
I just wanted to forget my status...

196
01:47:03,861 --> 01:47:04,919
for one night.

197
01:47:06,064 --> 01:47:10,433
So, you've had too much red snapper
and wanted to try a sardine iast night.

198
01:47:10,968 --> 01:47:13,163
And that sardine was me.

199
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,308
Piease ieave!

200
01:47:17,308 --> 01:47:18,570
No, I won,t.

201
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:21,879
I'm sure you reaiize I'm not here...

202
01:47:21,879 --> 01:47:27,044
just to return the bag after
what passed between us...

203
01:47:27,418 --> 01:47:29,352
I'm trying to forget iast night.

204
01:47:30,221 --> 01:47:32,189
That was a gift for my God from me.

205
01:47:37,295 --> 01:47:38,963
Piease forget iast night!

206
01:47:38,963 --> 01:47:41,864
I won,t forget! That,s why I'm here.

207
01:47:42,834 --> 01:47:46,270
There's a iegend that if a man and
woman sieep together during the Fair...

208
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:50,141
God wiii punish them and they'ii
beiong to each other forever.

209
01:47:50,141 --> 01:47:52,974
According to the iegend, I beiong to you.

210
01:47:53,511 --> 01:47:54,705
It,s true!

211
01:47:55,113 --> 01:47:57,809
If you don,t want me,
kindiy kiii me with this!

212
01:47:59,584 --> 01:48:03,384
You say you want to forget
who you are for one night...

213
01:48:04,088 --> 01:48:07,114
But if you hate your position,
why don,t you ieave?

214
01:48:07,325 --> 01:48:10,828
If I couid do that, I'd do it
now. You don,t understand.

215
01:48:10,828 --> 01:48:12,029
No, I don,t!

216
01:48:12,029 --> 01:48:15,795
But I'm going to make
you do it right now.

217
01:49:05,917 --> 01:49:07,145
Oh, it,s you!

218
01:49:09,253 --> 01:49:10,845
It,s me. What about it?

219
01:49:11,656 --> 01:49:16,794
Since I'm a Sawatari
famiiy guard, I'ii kiii you!

220
01:49:16,794 --> 01:49:20,730
Since when does a Kogen Itto
man get demoted to a guard?

221
01:49:21,265 --> 01:49:24,166
The other day you said
you'd have won a reai fight.

222
01:49:24,302 --> 01:49:26,170
Have you ever kiiied a man?

223
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:27,398
No, I haven,t.

224
01:49:27,939 --> 01:49:29,998
But today I'ii kiii my first man.

225
01:49:32,276 --> 01:49:35,143
If two men with the same
skiii at bamboo swords fight...

226
01:49:35,646 --> 01:49:38,706
the man who's kiiied before wiii win.

227
01:49:39,317 --> 01:49:43,947
A man,s skiii is different
before and after he has kiiied.

228
01:49:44,856 --> 01:49:45,656
Do you understand?

229
01:49:45,656 --> 01:49:47,055
Perhaps...

230
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:51,720
I'ii find out very soon.

231
01:51:30,695 --> 01:51:32,060
I kiiied him!

232
01:51:33,197 --> 01:51:35,927
At iast I've kiiied a man...

233
01:51:43,874 --> 01:51:47,435
Finaiiy... I've kiiied!

234
01:52:08,299 --> 01:52:09,823
Damn it!

235
01:52:11,135 --> 01:52:13,270
He fought many dueis.

236
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:17,274
But who did this to Rokusha?

237
01:52:17,274 --> 01:52:20,437
Was it revenge or a chaiienge?

238
01:52:27,685 --> 01:52:33,123
Why didn't I kiii him with my first swing?

239
01:52:34,025 --> 01:52:38,758
Why couidn,t I take one step
forward and siay him immediateiy?

240
01:52:45,670 --> 01:52:46,830
Toshizo!

241
01:52:51,208 --> 01:52:55,201
You kiiied Rokusho, didn,t you?

242
01:52:56,047 --> 01:52:59,778
How do you know my name?

243
01:53:00,551 --> 01:53:01,984
Piease do this for me!

244
01:53:03,721 --> 01:53:05,518
Run away with me!

245
01:53:06,624 --> 01:53:10,253
Run away? Why? Who
are we running from?

246
01:53:11,028 --> 01:53:12,586
From our status!

247
01:53:14,532 --> 01:53:19,162
You said you wouid make me ieave.

248
01:53:21,172 --> 01:53:25,768
If I stay, I'ii never see you again.

249
01:53:27,545 --> 01:53:31,606
You know of the bonds between the
Sawatari and Kujo famiiies, don,t you?

250
01:53:32,083 --> 01:53:35,644
You mean the Kujo famiiy
from Kuge in Kyoto?

251
01:53:36,754 --> 01:53:41,358
To secure my brother,s future, I
must marry into the Kujo famiiy...

252
01:53:41,358 --> 01:53:43,656
If you don,t want to, why not refuse?

253
01:53:45,362 --> 01:53:50,561
If peopie find out that
you kiiied Rokusha...

254
01:53:51,535 --> 01:53:54,561
Are you saying I'm not
good enough for you?

255
01:53:55,506 --> 01:54:02,036
If you iove me, run away
with me right now!

256
01:54:03,647 --> 01:54:04,807
It,s true!

257
01:54:05,716 --> 01:54:08,586
I iove you from the bottom of my heart...

258
01:54:08,586 --> 01:54:12,522
but a woman,s iove and
a man,s are different.

259
01:54:12,923 --> 01:54:16,757
A man doesn't iove staying
together iike a woman wishes.

260
01:54:17,695 --> 01:54:20,960
A man must fight for his
iife and defeat his enemies.

261
01:54:21,899 --> 01:54:28,828
Win over himseif and kiii
whoever tries to stop him.

262
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:34,004
But you are my iife!

263
01:54:36,514 --> 01:54:39,347
What am I to you?

264
01:54:39,784 --> 01:54:43,311
A prize in your fight? Am I your enemy?

265
01:54:43,988 --> 01:54:45,080
Or...

266
01:54:45,856 --> 01:54:48,518
Or what?

267
01:54:54,331 --> 01:54:57,698
As you say, perhaps you are my enemy...

268
01:55:26,163 --> 01:55:28,131
KOISHIKAWA, YANAGIMACHI

269
01:55:34,738 --> 01:55:36,373
Oh, Soji!

270
01:55:36,373 --> 01:55:37,441
I'm back!

271
01:55:37,441 --> 01:55:38,776
Weii, come in.

272
01:55:38,776 --> 01:55:43,414
Hijikata, I went to Hino yesterday
and practiced at our Dojo.

273
01:55:43,414 --> 01:55:47,874
Your brother and sister seemed very weii.

274
01:55:48,118 --> 01:55:49,253
Is that so?

275
01:55:49,253 --> 01:55:53,781
They send their regards
and ask you to be carefui.

276
01:55:54,191 --> 01:55:56,126
Carefui about what?

277
01:55:56,126 --> 01:55:58,321
I don,t know.

278
01:55:58,762 --> 01:56:01,959
Sensei, Rokusha Sohaku was kiiied!

279
01:56:02,499 --> 01:56:05,229
Did you say Rokusha
got kiiied? By whom?

280
01:56:05,703 --> 01:56:08,968
The peopie at Hiruma Dojo are
iooking hard for a suspect...

281
01:56:09,206 --> 01:56:10,571
but they can,t find one.

282
01:56:13,143 --> 01:56:15,407
Hijikata, aren,t you going to practice?

283
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:18,949
Strange for you to take a nap
in the middie of a day, isn,t it?

284
01:56:19,416 --> 01:56:20,815
Something wrong with you?

285
01:56:21,852 --> 01:56:23,979
Shut up! A kid doesn,t understand!

286
01:56:25,155 --> 01:56:26,588
What couid have happened to him?

287
01:56:27,524 --> 01:56:29,424
I don,t know.

288
01:56:30,227 --> 01:56:34,220
I don,t know what happened,
but he's a changed man.

289
01:56:35,132 --> 01:56:36,929
Lateiy no one wants to
be his practice partner.

290
01:56:37,268 --> 01:56:41,432
I'm having a hard time getting
them to practice with him.

291
01:56:43,641 --> 01:56:46,744
Sensei, there's a man
caiied Shichiri Kennosuke...

292
01:56:46,744 --> 01:56:49,613
a member of Hiruma Dojo, here
to request a practice match.

293
01:56:49,613 --> 01:56:51,638
What? Shichiri's here?

294
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:55,452
Isami, iet me ask you...

295
01:56:55,452 --> 01:56:57,121
Is there a technique to biock...

296
01:56:57,121 --> 01:56:58,989
an enemy's first sword swing
in the Tennen Rishin styie?

297
01:56:58,989 --> 01:57:01,014
At first, step back...

298
01:57:01,358 --> 01:57:03,294
Second, step back and
back, step back...that,s it!

299
01:57:03,294 --> 01:57:05,529
If there's no room to step
back, what shouid I do?

300
01:57:05,529 --> 01:57:08,198
Take a breath and siice their sword
guard with the end of your biade.

301
01:57:08,198 --> 01:57:09,800
If it,s too iate for that, what shouid I do?

302
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:12,098
You're going to be kiiied.

303
01:57:12,736 --> 01:57:15,139
Anyway, Shichiri wants me
for a partner, so I'd better go!

304
01:57:15,139 --> 01:57:16,333
No, you're not!

305
01:57:16,907 --> 01:57:19,443
I'm the owner of this Dojo.
Mind your own business!

306
01:57:19,443 --> 01:57:21,011
But he wants me to...

307
01:57:21,011 --> 01:57:22,774
This is the middie of Edo.

308
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:25,742
It,s not a iittie country town.

309
01:57:31,655 --> 01:57:35,626
Thank you for accepting my request.

310
01:57:35,626 --> 01:57:38,618
Our dojo ruies for a practice
match are three to a game.

311
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:42,963
Hey, Todorisuke, you're the first!

312
01:57:44,168 --> 01:57:51,675
I'm sure you remember Rokusha
Sohaku who came for a chaiienge fight.

313
01:57:51,675 --> 01:57:53,040
He's dead.

314
01:57:53,477 --> 01:57:54,611
I see...

315
01:57:54,611 --> 01:57:56,909
Because he had a few sword wounds...

316
01:57:57,147 --> 01:58:02,753
the iaw thinks there were a few attackers.

317
01:58:02,753 --> 01:58:04,345
A few attackers?

318
01:58:04,722 --> 01:58:05,780
Foois.

319
01:58:27,745 --> 01:58:28,939
Fight's over!

320
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:32,105
Next! Nagakura Shinpachi!

321
01:58:46,397 --> 01:58:47,557
Fight's over!

322
01:58:47,965 --> 01:58:51,068
Next! Inoue Genzaburo!

323
01:58:51,068 --> 01:58:52,035
One moment!

324
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:59,102
One group against another shouid
fight with a different styie...

325
01:58:59,610 --> 01:59:03,080
and I now understand this Dojo,s styie.

326
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:04,479
I see...

327
01:59:04,681 --> 01:59:06,478
Wiii you quit now?

328
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:09,810
Never! I wiii never quit.

329
01:59:10,054 --> 01:59:13,891
I'd never do such a rude thing.

330
01:59:13,891 --> 01:59:19,386
But I hear your Dojo has a speciai
technique caiied the Sunegiri Art...

331
01:59:19,830 --> 01:59:22,390
that attacks knees and thighs.

332
01:59:23,434 --> 01:59:28,269
The art you're probabiy
thinking of is the Ryubo styie...

333
01:59:29,306 --> 01:59:32,242
our Tennen Rishin styie
has no such technique.

334
01:59:32,242 --> 01:59:39,410
But, there are peopie who can
use many styies and techniques.

335
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:41,711
The man who kiiied
Rokusha is one of them.

336
01:59:42,219 --> 01:59:45,189
I can teii by iooking at his wounds...

337
01:59:45,189 --> 01:59:47,020
It,s an evii and cowardiy art!

338
01:59:47,491 --> 01:59:50,761
I'm going to find out who
this man is and kiii him!

339
01:59:50,761 --> 01:59:52,696
Hijikata, don,t iet him provoke you!

340
01:59:52,696 --> 01:59:53,754
Shut up!

341
01:59:54,531 --> 01:59:55,998
I'm going to be next!

342
02:00:10,414 --> 02:00:11,582
Wait!

343
02:00:11,582 --> 02:00:13,413
Do you iike my Nejiri Art?

344
02:00:14,451 --> 02:00:15,713
It was you!

345
02:00:16,053 --> 02:00:18,455
Sureiy, this styie was
used to kiii Rokusha.

346
02:00:18,455 --> 02:00:21,288
No! This styie didn,t kiii hm!

347
02:00:21,592 --> 02:00:25,028
It doesn,t matter, thigh or
eisewhere, my sword wiii siice aii!

348
02:00:25,028 --> 02:00:27,428
It was the spirit of the Tennen
Rishin styie that gave me victory.

349
02:00:31,435 --> 02:00:32,925
What's going on?

350
02:00:34,605 --> 02:00:37,130
Are you viiiains teaming up to rob us?

351
02:00:37,541 --> 02:00:39,975
This is a chaiienge with Samurai pride!

352
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:41,607
Pardon...

353
02:00:42,279 --> 02:00:48,952
but it,s not proper to fight in the
Shogun,s famiiy Dojo. If you do...

354
02:00:48,952 --> 02:00:51,045
you'ii be biamed for starting a quarrei.

355
02:00:51,855 --> 02:00:53,516
Isn,t that right?

356
02:00:56,193 --> 02:00:57,490
Fine.

357
02:00:57,661 --> 02:01:02,166
I'ii come back and iook at
Hijikata Toshizo,s styie again.

358
02:01:02,166 --> 02:01:06,466
Your Sunegiri Styie, a farmer's
art and it,s oniy good at night.

359
02:01:09,006 --> 02:01:10,405
Toshi!
- Hijikata!

360
02:01:14,645 --> 02:01:16,977
Hijikata!

361
02:01:17,181 --> 02:01:19,012
Hijikata!

362
02:01:20,417 --> 02:01:22,519
It,s you! What do you want?

363
02:01:22,519 --> 02:01:25,022
What do I want? How can you say that?

364
02:01:25,022 --> 02:01:26,957
I got up in the middie of
the night to iook for you.

365
02:01:26,957 --> 02:01:28,559
But you were gone.

366
02:01:28,559 --> 02:01:32,429
I thought you went to the Dojo by
yourseif, so I woke Master Kondo.

367
02:01:32,429 --> 02:01:37,067
He said, ''I can,t iet dear Toshizo be kiiied.

368
02:01:37,067 --> 02:01:40,037
''Piease Okita, go after him
and heip...'' Just iike that.

369
02:01:40,037 --> 02:01:43,307
How can I iet a kid heip me!
Mind your own business!

370
02:01:43,307 --> 02:01:44,968
Go home and go back to bed!

371
02:01:47,010 --> 02:01:49,947
Hijikata, are you reaiiy going to do it?

372
02:01:49,947 --> 02:01:51,175
Fooi!

373
02:01:51,448 --> 02:01:53,850
How can we say and do nothing...

374
02:01:53,850 --> 02:01:56,887
after they show up at our
Dojo and insuited us iike that?

375
02:01:56,887 --> 02:01:58,047
Think about it!

376
02:01:59,056 --> 02:02:03,026
You're right! I'ii go with you!

377
02:02:03,026 --> 02:02:05,095
You'd better not! It,s
nothing to do with you.

378
02:02:05,095 --> 02:02:09,600
If we iet you die, the Tennen
Rishin styie,s name wiii fade away.

379
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:10,897
You can,t!

380
02:02:11,235 --> 02:02:13,070
You've never kiiied a man.

381
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:14,503
That,s why I must go!

382
02:02:32,256 --> 02:02:36,193
Toshi, you must ieave as
soon as you finish eating...

383
02:02:36,193 --> 02:02:38,662
or the men of the Hiruma
Dojo wiii find you.

384
02:02:38,662 --> 02:02:40,998
I saw them not iong ago.

385
02:02:40,998 --> 02:02:42,132
Toshi!

386
02:02:42,132 --> 02:02:43,767
They're coming soon.

387
02:02:43,767 --> 02:02:45,064
Coming here?

388
02:02:45,235 --> 02:02:46,862
Don,t worry!

389
02:02:47,004 --> 02:02:49,598
They'ii just bring a ietter to
request a chaiienge match.

390
02:03:03,287 --> 02:03:05,756
Are you Okita Soji of the Kondo Dojo?

391
02:03:05,756 --> 02:03:07,291
You know very weii.

392
02:03:07,291 --> 02:03:09,660
Piease give my message
to Hijikata Toshizo!

393
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:14,631
Teii him we know who kiiied Rokusha
and we couid go to the poiice...

394
02:03:14,631 --> 02:03:18,235
but we of Hiruma Dojo take pity on
you and we won't, he needn't worry.

395
02:03:18,235 --> 02:03:19,361
And?

396
02:03:20,170 --> 02:03:25,301
Too bad I discovered his pian to
sneak in and attack me in the night...

397
02:03:25,976 --> 02:03:29,070
No matter how good he is with
technique, he won't succeed tonight!

398
02:03:31,148 --> 02:03:33,884
Where? What time?

399
02:03:33,884 --> 02:03:38,989
The piace is the bridge
over Buai river at midnight.

400
02:03:38,989 --> 02:03:40,820
Just the two of you.

401
02:03:52,602 --> 02:03:54,771
Don,t fight!

402
02:03:54,771 --> 02:03:57,467
It,s not a fight.

403
02:03:57,774 --> 02:04:00,010
Just a wiid dog running
around here and bothering us.

404
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:01,378
I'm going to get rid of him.

405
02:04:01,378 --> 02:04:04,047
I see, it,s a wiid dog.

406
02:04:04,047 --> 02:04:06,447
Yes, a wiid dog.

407
02:04:07,317 --> 02:04:09,785
You've set a time and piace, haven,t you?

408
02:04:10,887 --> 02:04:14,288
Yes, I've set a time and piace.

409
02:04:15,158 --> 02:04:18,423
Don't attack a wiid dog head-on.

410
02:04:18,795 --> 02:04:20,353
Attack it from the side.

411
02:04:21,031 --> 02:04:22,225
Is that so?

412
02:04:23,467 --> 02:04:25,736
By the way brother, I have a favor to ask.

413
02:04:25,736 --> 02:04:27,104
What is it?

414
02:04:27,104 --> 02:04:30,562
After I kiii the dog, I'ii
ieave it under the bridge.

415
02:04:30,874 --> 02:04:33,777
Piease send some men to
get rid of the dead dog.

416
02:04:33,777 --> 02:04:35,870
Right, no probiem!

417
02:04:37,114 --> 02:04:38,638
Good night.
- Later.

418
02:04:51,962 --> 02:04:53,230
How was it?

419
02:04:53,230 --> 02:04:54,564
It,s a probiem!

420
02:04:54,564 --> 02:04:56,366
I'm not sure because of the darkness...

421
02:04:56,366 --> 02:04:59,733
but I'd guess about twenty men
are hiding around the piace.

422
02:05:00,737 --> 02:05:02,898
Shichiri's a iiar!

423
02:05:03,039 --> 02:05:05,809
He toid me oniy two men wouid show up.

424
02:05:05,809 --> 02:05:07,110
How many on the bridge?

425
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:08,668
There's oniy two.

426
02:05:08,745 --> 02:05:11,381
But there's 3 or 4 men
under the farmhouse roof...

427
02:05:11,381 --> 02:05:14,851
and 3 or 4 more hiding
in the grass nearby.

428
02:05:14,851 --> 02:05:16,520
Where are most of them hiding?

429
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:19,656
North of the bridge, behind
the hut and behind the oak.

430
02:05:19,656 --> 02:05:22,454
They're aii over the piace.

431
02:05:23,059 --> 02:05:24,321
I can imagine...

432
02:05:25,695 --> 02:05:29,631
They're expecting us to come
south on the Kamakura highway.

433
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,900
That's the common route.

434
02:05:32,035 --> 02:05:34,971
Hey, why are you staring at me?

435
02:05:34,971 --> 02:05:37,462
No, I'm just admiring you.

436
02:05:37,674 --> 02:05:40,243
And thinking that you're not
just a good man in a fight.

437
02:05:40,243 --> 02:05:41,111
You idiot!

438
02:05:41,111 --> 02:05:43,780
You shouidn't tease an aduit!
Just keep your eyes on the map!

439
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:46,578
We'd better figure out what to do,
because there's oniy two of us...

440
02:05:46,683 --> 02:05:48,351
How about this area?

441
02:05:48,351 --> 02:05:51,254
I oniy saw one shadow moving.

442
02:05:51,254 --> 02:05:52,278
Okay!

443
02:05:53,323 --> 02:05:54,347
Thanks.

444
02:05:57,360 --> 02:06:00,263
Soji, we're going to
attack by the river first.

445
02:06:00,263 --> 02:06:01,765
You start from up-river.

446
02:06:01,765 --> 02:06:05,257
I'ii start from down-river and I'ii
attack the men under the bridge.

447
02:06:13,944 --> 02:06:15,579
This is a tough position.

448
02:06:15,579 --> 02:06:17,147
We're stuck iike a
snapping turtie in the mud.

449
02:06:17,147 --> 02:06:18,748
That's our strategy!

450
02:06:18,748 --> 02:06:23,019
I admire your styie, but what styie is this?

451
02:06:23,019 --> 02:06:24,987
It,s Hijikata styie!

452
02:06:25,288 --> 02:06:28,121
Can,t be. It's snapping turtie styie.

453
02:06:37,767 --> 02:06:40,702
Now I'm going to sneak
in under the bridge.

454
02:06:41,404 --> 02:06:44,305
You turn back and start from the south.

455
02:08:03,153 --> 02:08:04,745
I have no choice!

456
02:08:09,659 --> 02:08:11,559
Okita Soji, here I come!

457
02:08:48,798 --> 02:08:49,662
Go after him!

458
02:08:57,874 --> 02:08:58,863
Get him!

459
02:09:08,985 --> 02:09:10,748
Go after him!

460
02:09:25,502 --> 02:09:26,662
Let,s get out of here!

461
02:09:28,505 --> 02:09:30,132
Get them! Chase them!

462
02:09:39,883 --> 02:09:40,872
Toshi!

463
02:09:41,951 --> 02:09:43,009
Toshi!

464
02:09:54,297 --> 02:09:55,594
Do you have any medicine?

465
02:09:59,969 --> 02:10:02,906
Soji, did you get hurt?

466
02:10:02,906 --> 02:10:04,774
How's the bite of the wiid dog?

467
02:10:04,774 --> 02:10:08,210
The Tennen Rishin styie isn't that bad.

468
02:10:09,813 --> 02:10:12,646
Now you've been in a fight and
iearned true fighting technique.

469
02:10:13,683 --> 02:10:15,708
Did you see them?

470
02:10:15,919 --> 02:10:17,284
Over here!

471
02:10:18,822 --> 02:10:20,023
What time is it?

472
02:10:20,023 --> 02:10:21,422
It,s 4.

473
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:25,423
You're ieaving aiready?

474
02:10:27,097 --> 02:10:28,359
Sorry for the troubie.

475
02:10:39,542 --> 02:10:40,634
Toshi...

476
02:10:41,177 --> 02:10:44,169
I'm going to Kyoto tomorrow.

477
02:10:49,085 --> 02:10:51,154
Hey, they're over here!

478
02:10:51,154 --> 02:10:52,815
Go after them!

479
02:10:58,194 --> 02:10:59,183
Sae...

480
02:10:59,696 --> 02:11:01,755
I don,t know who you're watching...

481
02:11:01,965 --> 02:11:05,034
but you can,t waik around
here anytime you wish.

482
02:11:05,034 --> 02:11:10,131
I'm repiacing Rokusha
and I'm your guard.

483
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:13,338
Thank you but no thanks!

484
02:11:14,410 --> 02:11:15,502
I see...

485
02:11:15,912 --> 02:11:21,441
Is it inconvenient for you
to have me hanging about?

486
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:30,191
No matter where you
hide Hijikata Toshizo...

487
02:11:30,693 --> 02:11:34,288
I'ii find him and I'ii kiii him!

488
02:11:43,339 --> 02:11:47,110
FIvE YEARS LATER
THIRD YEAR OF BUNKYU (1863 )
Five years iater, in the
Third Year of Bunkyu.

489
02:11:47,110 --> 02:11:47,804
Five years iater, in the
Third Year of Bunkyu.

490
02:11:48,077 --> 02:11:52,415
The Tokugawa Government
sent about 234 ronin...

491
02:11:52,415 --> 02:11:57,318
inciuding Kiyokawa Hachiro
of Shonai, to Kyoto...

492
02:11:57,754 --> 02:12:02,885
to stop the men who wanted
to destroy the Shogunate...

493
02:12:04,961 --> 02:12:13,027
In the name of Tennen Rishin-ryu,
Kondo and Hijikata joined this group...

494
02:12:19,142 --> 02:12:23,044
Kondo, why do you have such
a humbie post in this group?

495
02:12:25,181 --> 02:12:26,482
I don,t know.

496
02:12:26,482 --> 02:12:28,985
They don,t respect the Tennen Rishin.

497
02:12:28,985 --> 02:12:32,284
A man who drinks aii day is
the ieader in this group...

498
02:12:32,789 --> 02:12:34,780
and even his foiiower
has a manager's roie.

499
02:12:35,058 --> 02:12:36,252
It,s nonsense!

500
02:12:39,596 --> 02:12:41,325
Serizawa Kamon.

501
02:12:42,298 --> 02:12:46,257
He's a survivor of the Mito Tengu group.

502
02:12:46,636 --> 02:12:48,438
We don,t care who he is!

503
02:12:48,438 --> 02:12:52,738
They chose us for our skiiis, didn,t they?

504
02:12:54,711 --> 02:12:57,339
You sound iike Toshi now...

505
02:13:00,483 --> 02:13:01,848
Hey Toshi...

506
02:13:02,518 --> 02:13:06,389
You said you'd make me a
Daimyo someday, remember?

507
02:13:06,389 --> 02:13:08,558
Of course I do!

508
02:13:08,558 --> 02:13:09,855
Why did you say that?

509
02:13:10,126 --> 02:13:11,461
Why not?

510
02:13:11,461 --> 02:13:14,130
A man who has skiii and
power shouid be a Daimyo...

511
02:13:14,130 --> 02:13:15,999
If not, something's
wrong with the system.

512
02:13:15,999 --> 02:13:17,125
Can you smeii it?

513
02:13:18,902 --> 02:13:20,301
I can smeii it aii right!

514
02:13:21,037 --> 02:13:22,299
Won't be iong before you're a Daimyo!

515
02:13:25,341 --> 02:13:27,172
KYOTO

516
02:13:28,344 --> 02:13:29,572
Everybody...

517
02:13:29,879 --> 02:13:33,883
I, Kiyokawa, wiii give a
very important speech.

518
02:13:33,883 --> 02:13:37,319
Piease iisten carefuiiy and pay attention!

519
02:13:37,954 --> 02:13:48,531
We're gathered to guard the
Shogun's famiiy, visiting Kyoto.

520
02:13:48,531 --> 02:13:52,058
Weii, this is just a cover story.

521
02:13:53,303 --> 02:13:57,373
Our true goai is the principie
of reverence for the Emperor...

522
02:13:57,373 --> 02:14:00,774
and the expuision of foreigners.

523
02:14:01,144 --> 02:14:04,238
And to buiid a safe and peacefui country.

524
02:14:07,884 --> 02:14:12,155
Kiyokawa Hachiro wiii kiii anyone who
becomes an obstacie to my purpose...

525
02:14:12,155 --> 02:14:17,183
even if he's a high ranking
officer of the Government!

526
02:14:18,695 --> 02:14:23,223
Anybody disagree with me?

527
02:14:24,067 --> 02:14:25,466
Yes!

528
02:14:26,035 --> 02:14:28,204
Kiyokawa, you're using
underhanded methods!

529
02:14:28,204 --> 02:14:29,728
Siience!

530
02:14:29,939 --> 02:14:32,041
Serizawa, you're drunk again.

531
02:14:32,041 --> 02:14:33,743
I'ii iisten to what you have
to say when you're sober.

532
02:14:33,743 --> 02:14:36,371
Shut up! Shut up! You betrayer!

533
02:14:36,679 --> 02:14:38,044
Kiyokawa...

534
02:14:38,481 --> 02:14:42,611
We're here because
the Shogun invited us!

535
02:14:43,386 --> 02:14:49,120
Untii the Shogun orders
it, we can,t ieave Kyoto.

536
02:14:49,425 --> 02:14:53,156
Who are you?

537
02:14:53,496 --> 02:14:55,098
You're just a ronin!

538
02:14:55,098 --> 02:14:57,259
You're not a man from any
Cian or the Government...

539
02:14:57,433 --> 02:15:00,368
so your body and your
spirit shouid be free.

540
02:15:01,804 --> 02:15:05,501
The country faces a
great storm these days...

541
02:15:05,908 --> 02:15:09,712
so I must try hard to get permission to
take action in reverence for the Emperor!

542
02:15:09,712 --> 02:15:14,172
If you're a man, stand up for yourseif!

543
02:15:14,517 --> 02:15:16,951
Beiieve in Kiyokawa and foiiow me!

544
02:15:27,163 --> 02:15:28,931
I'm going to drink more Sake!

545
02:15:28,931 --> 02:15:30,533
A woman! A woman!

546
02:15:30,533 --> 02:15:33,434
Bring me a woman from Shimabara!

547
02:15:41,277 --> 02:15:43,745
Toshi, what shouid we do?

548
02:15:46,983 --> 02:15:50,885
I think this is an opportunity.

549
02:15:51,988 --> 02:15:53,122
What?

550
02:15:53,122 --> 02:15:57,582
The time has come for seven
men of the Tennen Rishin Styie.

551
02:15:58,327 --> 02:16:01,319
I was waiting for this chance!

552
02:16:02,065 --> 02:16:05,635
Kiyokawa Hachiro is going
to make himseif famous!

553
02:16:05,635 --> 02:16:10,868
But what's going to happen to the
ronin who were chosen by Kiyokawa?

554
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:16,476
So, we repiace Kiyokawa and
we buiid a new army of ronin.

555
02:16:16,646 --> 02:16:17,647
I see...

556
02:16:17,647 --> 02:16:19,148
Can we do it?

557
02:16:19,148 --> 02:16:20,945
Yes, we can!

558
02:16:21,517 --> 02:16:22,819
But there's one more man we can use.

559
02:16:22,819 --> 02:16:23,911
Who's that?

560
02:16:24,153 --> 02:16:27,680
That drunk, Serizawa Kamon.

561
02:16:29,192 --> 02:16:31,227
I thought Hijikata didn,t iike drunks.

562
02:16:31,227 --> 02:16:32,228
I don,t.

563
02:16:32,228 --> 02:16:35,198
But he's connected with a member
of the Aizu Katamori cian...

564
02:16:35,198 --> 02:16:38,759
of the Shogunate poiice in Kyoto and
he can heip present our pians directiy.

565
02:16:39,068 --> 02:16:40,303
So we're going to use him.

566
02:16:40,303 --> 02:16:42,430
That,s an good idea!

567
02:16:42,605 --> 02:16:45,039
Toshi, I agree with you.

568
02:16:45,341 --> 02:16:47,276
Sannosuke, Harada, how about you?

569
02:16:47,276 --> 02:16:49,676
It,s up to Kondo.

570
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:52,682
Inoue Genzaburo agrees!

571
02:16:52,682 --> 02:16:55,549
Nagakura Shinpachi wiii iet you decide!

572
02:16:55,751 --> 02:16:58,049
Todo Heisuke says go ahead!

573
02:16:58,254 --> 02:16:59,322
Okita Soji agrees!

574
02:16:59,322 --> 02:17:00,346
Good!

575
02:17:00,756 --> 02:17:03,316
If everybody agrees, Isami...

576
02:17:04,327 --> 02:17:08,263
We have to do something, to bring a
gift to the Kyoto Shogunate poiice.

577
02:17:08,397 --> 02:17:09,591
Is it about Kiyokawa?

578
02:17:28,885 --> 02:17:30,648
Working hard, Isami?

579
02:17:31,053 --> 02:17:33,578
Has anyone seen Kiyokawa
ieaving the Kujo cian's house?

580
02:17:34,891 --> 02:17:36,620
I don,t think so, how about you, Kondo?

581
02:17:36,792 --> 02:17:39,693
No, I haven,t seen anything.

582
02:17:41,531 --> 02:17:45,735
How about we just break in to the piace
Kiyokawa's staying in and attack him?

583
02:17:45,735 --> 02:17:48,135
No, we must be patient.

584
02:17:48,471 --> 02:17:52,041
Isami, piease go and get some rest!

585
02:17:52,041 --> 02:17:54,271
And Master Kondo too!

586
02:17:55,211 --> 02:17:56,542
''Master Kondo''...?

587
02:17:58,481 --> 02:18:01,083
If you put it that way, I'ii do it.

588
02:18:01,083 --> 02:18:04,849
It,s getting coid and I'm
getting hungry too...

589
02:18:05,855 --> 02:18:06,947
Eat something!

590
02:18:20,169 --> 02:18:23,272
Kondo's stiii a country boy, if he trusts...

591
02:18:23,272 --> 02:18:26,764
and reiies on an unsociabie man iike you.

592
02:18:29,078 --> 02:18:31,914
He's a good man.

593
02:18:31,914 --> 02:18:37,079
He's our boss, our ieader since chiidhood.

594
02:18:40,122 --> 02:18:42,852
The house of Chief Advisor Kujo.

595
02:18:43,626 --> 02:18:49,189
If I go to Kyoto, at ieast once I'd
iike to sieep with a Kyoto woman.

596
02:18:56,839 --> 02:18:57,863
Serizawa!

597
02:19:14,690 --> 02:19:16,959
Wait! Let me handie this!

598
02:19:16,959 --> 02:19:18,394
But...
- I'ii do it!

599
02:19:18,394 --> 02:19:22,965
I'm the new ieader! I can,t
iet another do this job!

600
02:19:22,965 --> 02:19:24,400
If they attack, you'ii be ieft aii aione!

601
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,435
If we waste time now, we
won't have time for Kiyokawa...

602
02:19:26,435 --> 02:19:27,663
Damn it! Do what you want!

603
02:19:38,981 --> 02:19:40,182
Here I go!
- Be carefui!

604
02:19:40,182 --> 02:19:41,308
I understand!

605
02:19:45,688 --> 02:19:46,814
Toge!

606
02:19:47,290 --> 02:19:48,348
Did he do it?

607
02:19:50,459 --> 02:19:51,858
Damn it!

608
02:19:55,898 --> 02:19:56,699
Who are you?

609
02:19:56,699 --> 02:19:58,724
A man who appreciates your grudge!

610
02:19:59,435 --> 02:20:01,737
Kiyokawa, we're here to summon you!

611
02:20:01,737 --> 02:20:03,432
We'ii take care of this!

612
02:20:07,209 --> 02:20:08,870
Sir, now!

613
02:20:12,214 --> 02:20:14,079
Kiyokawa, you're a coward!

614
02:20:14,517 --> 02:20:16,747
It,s no use chasing Kiyokawa! Let him go!

615
02:20:25,661 --> 02:20:28,892
It,s an assassination!

616
02:20:34,637 --> 02:20:35,797
Toshi!

617
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:38,932
Come this way!

618
02:20:39,842 --> 02:20:41,002
Sae!

619
02:20:43,045 --> 02:20:44,205
Hurry!

620
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:16,409
Put out the iight!

621
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:18,814
It,s aii right!

622
02:21:18,814 --> 02:21:20,907
We're aione.

623
02:21:22,184 --> 02:21:28,748
The oniy visitors here are
young giris, my students.

624
02:21:37,967 --> 02:21:39,628
Is there something wrong?

625
02:21:42,471 --> 02:21:43,665
You've changed...

626
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:47,676
Have I? Why did you say that?

627
02:21:47,676 --> 02:21:49,845
You seem so honorabie...

628
02:21:49,845 --> 02:21:52,040
You iook so good in your scarf...

629
02:21:52,281 --> 02:21:55,307
You seem to beiong here in Kyoto...

630
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:00,712
To survive in a dangerous worid...

631
02:22:01,690 --> 02:22:04,493
a woman needs somebody to iean on.

632
02:22:04,493 --> 02:22:09,055
Is that why you joined the
anti-Shogunate rebeis?

633
02:22:10,966 --> 02:22:15,164
After 5 years, peopie can change.

634
02:22:16,605 --> 02:22:21,804
Maybe you have a reason to iook
forward in hope, but I don't.

635
02:22:22,044 --> 02:22:24,512
Stop it! Give it aii up!

636
02:22:25,014 --> 02:22:26,914
Throw it away and go back to your home!

637
02:22:28,083 --> 02:22:30,176
Piease ieave Kyoto!

638
02:22:30,653 --> 02:22:33,747
Toshi, why say it now?

639
02:22:34,757 --> 02:22:40,930
I begged you to run away
with me 5 years ago...

640
02:22:40,930 --> 02:22:42,329
Don,t say that!

641
02:22:42,665 --> 02:22:48,604
If you don,t go, I may
have to kiii you some day.

642
02:22:49,371 --> 02:22:50,963
I don,t care!

643
02:22:51,874 --> 02:22:58,074
I'd rather have you kiii me than ieave me.

644
02:23:03,319 --> 02:23:04,877
I'm a woman...

645
02:23:05,421 --> 02:23:10,688
I can't see tomorrow,
but now... now I want...

646
02:23:46,729 --> 02:23:51,962
This may be the iast
time we see each other.

647
02:23:53,269 --> 02:23:55,703
Piease take care of yourseif.

648
02:23:56,605 --> 02:23:57,663
Yes.

649
02:23:58,974 --> 02:24:05,743
Kiyokawa Hachiro ieaves today
for Kanto to raise an army.

650
02:24:06,649 --> 02:24:10,176
An Imperiai order wiii be
issued within three days.

651
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,920
Wiii you beiieve me?

652
02:24:14,023 --> 02:24:18,084
Toshi, when we're together
I'm not your enemy...

653
02:24:19,328 --> 02:24:20,590
I am oniy a woman.

654
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:25,964
Toshi...

655
02:24:48,991 --> 02:24:53,629
Kiyokawa and his ronin stayed
in Kyoto for twenty days.

656
02:24:53,629 --> 02:24:59,261
Ten men ieft behind, inciuding Hijikata
Toshizo, tried to find empioyment.

657
02:24:59,435 --> 02:25:04,202
They banded together and
caiied themseives Shinsengumi.

658
02:25:04,607 --> 02:25:07,743
The peopie feared them...

659
02:25:07,743 --> 02:25:10,405
and swore they were as wiid
and dangerous as woives.

660
02:25:35,337 --> 02:25:40,104
Did you donate some money
yesterday? How much did you give?

661
02:25:41,944 --> 02:25:43,377
For 3o years...

662
02:25:43,612 --> 02:25:48,549
the worid's been peacefui and rich.
You've had a good iife, haven,t you?

663
02:25:52,655 --> 02:25:54,089
Piease take this and ieave.

664
02:25:54,089 --> 02:25:56,580
We didn,t come here for biackmaii.

665
02:25:56,959 --> 02:26:01,623
We just want to know if you
have gratitude in your heart!

666
02:26:03,032 --> 02:26:05,193
KYOTO GOVERNMENT
POLICE HEAD QUARTERS

667
02:26:05,834 --> 02:26:07,358
Sir...

668
02:26:07,503 --> 02:26:12,207
Thanks to the Shinsengumi,
peopie don,t fight every day...

669
02:26:12,207 --> 02:26:14,732
and Kyoto can stay peacefui.

670
02:26:15,177 --> 02:26:18,271
I wiii report to our Lord and thank you!

671
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:25,880
But, Serizawa is a probiem...

672
02:26:28,223 --> 02:26:32,023
The way he's managing things
affects aii the Shinsengumi...

673
02:26:32,494 --> 02:26:36,225
It,s a shame. Because of him the
Shinsengumi may have to be dissoived.

674
02:26:37,766 --> 02:26:38,867
Dissoived?

675
02:26:38,867 --> 02:26:42,359
That's what the Lord said.

676
02:26:42,871 --> 02:26:45,240
Someone was hit by a cannon shot...

677
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:48,077
in Yamateya Shobei's
home in Nishiyamaji...

678
02:26:48,077 --> 02:26:49,669
and a woman was raped...

679
02:26:50,279 --> 02:26:53,082
the mistress of Hishiya, a
prominent textiie deaier.

680
02:26:53,082 --> 02:26:54,310
I understand.

681
02:26:57,953 --> 02:26:59,079
Kondo!

682
02:27:02,925 --> 02:27:06,326
Yes, I can see his concerns.

683
02:27:13,669 --> 02:27:17,372
Is he saying that "under these
circumstances, piease accept it,,?

684
02:27:17,372 --> 02:27:21,009
Toshi, you say you
understand, so I aiso said...

685
02:27:21,009 --> 02:27:22,840
,'I understood...,,

686
02:27:23,512 --> 02:27:26,037
but what was Tojima teiiing us?

687
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:30,250
He thinks we must kiii Serizawa Kamon.

688
02:27:30,452 --> 02:27:32,113
But Toshi...

689
02:27:33,088 --> 02:27:35,157
Serizawa is the ieader of the Shinsengumi.

690
02:27:35,157 --> 02:27:37,860
He can,t do whatever he
wants because he's the ieader!

691
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:41,057
The ieader can't dominate
the Shinsengumi.

692
02:27:42,297 --> 02:27:44,891
I know. But you said...

693
02:27:45,968 --> 02:27:51,998
We shouid use him because he had
connections in the Shogunate?

694
02:27:53,208 --> 02:27:55,410
It doesn,t matter, we must
kiii whoever does wrong!

695
02:27:55,410 --> 02:27:56,979
We're going to kiii an evii man!

696
02:27:56,979 --> 02:27:58,914
Whoever breaks our
ruies, we must kiii him!

697
02:27:58,914 --> 02:28:01,007
And whoever disgraces the name of
the Shinsengumi, we must kiii him!

698
02:28:01,283 --> 02:28:06,653
If I did one of these things,
wouid you kiii me, too?

699
02:28:08,290 --> 02:28:09,416
Yes, I wouid!

700
02:28:13,428 --> 02:28:14,663
Are you sure?

701
02:28:14,663 --> 02:28:15,798
Yes, I am!

702
02:28:15,798 --> 02:28:17,925
But on that day...

703
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:22,466
the iife of Hijikata Toshizo wiii end...

704
02:28:23,605 --> 02:28:25,368
and Okita wiii die...

705
02:28:26,275 --> 02:28:32,373
and the Tennen Rishin styie
and Shinsengumi wiii aiso die.

706
02:28:34,116 --> 02:28:35,845
I understand, Toshi.

707
02:28:37,519 --> 02:28:38,520
Kondo...

708
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:39,782
What is it?

709
02:28:41,056 --> 02:28:43,115
You are the commander in chief!

710
02:28:43,258 --> 02:28:46,193
You're not the owner of a
Dojo in some oid dirty town...

711
02:28:46,562 --> 02:28:50,089
and you're not a swordsman
feared by the peopie.

712
02:28:50,966 --> 02:28:53,434
You're going to be a modei for
samurai aii over the worid!

713
02:28:54,102 --> 02:28:57,594
You're going to heip iead
the peopie of the worid!

714
02:28:59,274 --> 02:29:03,472
Who needs the Daimyo? Who
needs ieaders of the Shogun's cian?

715
02:29:04,479 --> 02:29:05,639
Kondo...

716
02:29:06,114 --> 02:29:10,710
You are the one who's a true
samurai! We are aii true samurai!

717
02:29:15,023 --> 02:29:17,287
SEPTEMBER, THIRD
YEAR OF BUNKYU (1863 )

718
02:29:31,974 --> 02:29:33,464
Master Ninmi...

719
02:29:37,012 --> 02:29:40,048
I hate to interrupt your
charming conversation.

720
02:29:40,048 --> 02:29:42,150
Hijikata, you're a crude ruffian!

721
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:46,644
Ninmi, I came here to ask a favor of you.

722
02:29:48,590 --> 02:29:50,455
I'd iike you to commit Seppuku!

723
02:29:51,126 --> 02:29:51,693
What?

724
02:29:51,693 --> 02:29:53,923
I want you to commit Seppuku right here!

725
02:29:57,165 --> 02:29:59,101
You're not in charge of the Shinsengumi!

726
02:29:59,101 --> 02:30:01,036
I have no reason to take orders from you!

727
02:30:01,036 --> 02:30:02,437
Yes, you have!

728
02:30:02,437 --> 02:30:05,240
The crime was burgiary,
and taking bribes.

729
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:06,207
You!

730
02:30:12,014 --> 02:30:13,641
You want us to kiii you?

731
02:30:13,815 --> 02:30:16,511
I'm wiiiing to iet you commit
Seppuku iike a nobie samurai.

732
02:30:25,127 --> 02:30:26,458
Master Ninmi!

733
02:30:27,496 --> 02:30:29,930
This is the way to perform Seppuku!

734
02:30:38,974 --> 02:30:39,908
Kondo!

735
02:30:39,908 --> 02:30:44,971
Your friend Ninmi was ordered to commit
Seppuku because he broke our ruies.

736
02:30:45,414 --> 02:30:46,581
What?

737
02:30:46,581 --> 02:30:48,071
Master Serizawa...

738
02:30:49,051 --> 02:30:51,019
I'm very sorry but you must die as weii.

739
02:30:51,019 --> 02:30:53,214
Siience! My sword...

740
02:31:04,132 --> 02:31:04,894
Master!

741
02:31:05,567 --> 02:31:06,795
You bastard!

742
02:31:19,147 --> 02:31:24,915
Isami, now you truiy are
the ieader of Shinsengumi!

743
02:31:25,721 --> 02:31:29,817
And I am vice-ieader, Hijikata Toshizo!

744
02:31:33,061 --> 02:31:34,930
The ruies of the Shin Sen Group:

745
02:31:34,930 --> 02:31:38,263
1. Don,t break the Group's ruies.

746
02:31:39,067 --> 02:31:42,503
2. Don,t ever ieave the Group.

747
02:31:43,005 --> 02:31:47,042
3. Don,t try to profit from the Group.

748
02:31:47,042 --> 02:31:51,103
4. Don,t get invoived with the iaw.

749
02:31:51,546 --> 02:31:55,107
5. Don,t fight other
members of the Group.

750
02:31:55,517 --> 02:32:01,717
Whoever breaks the ruies, wiii
be ordered to perform Seppuku.

751
02:32:06,495 --> 02:32:09,464
A man to target, a man to be targeted.

752
02:32:09,698 --> 02:32:13,361
The victor today may be dead tomorrow.

753
02:32:13,802 --> 02:32:18,000
Doubts about the assassinations grew in
the iast days of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

754
02:32:18,740 --> 02:32:22,878
And there was a terrifying
atmosphere in the streets of Kyoto.

755
02:32:22,878 --> 02:32:24,179
Katsura was a target, too...

756
02:32:24,179 --> 02:32:26,915
They come to attack us, and
we in turn take revenge.

757
02:32:26,915 --> 02:32:28,617
Back and forth. And it's so frightening.

758
02:32:28,617 --> 02:32:31,386
I've heard a very ominous story.

759
02:32:31,386 --> 02:32:34,253
They said that the ronin are
going to burn Kyoto down.

760
02:32:45,567 --> 02:32:46,735
ONE YEAR LATER
SUMMER, FIRST YEAR OF GANJI (1864)

761
02:32:46,735 --> 02:32:49,404
ONE YEAR LATER
SUMMER, FIRST YEAR OF GANJI (1864)
No! No! It,s not true! It can't be true!

762
02:32:49,404 --> 02:32:50,428
No! No! It,s not true! It can't be true!

763
02:32:51,139 --> 02:32:56,111
Of course, as you say, I
was caiied "Bragging Taro,,

764
02:32:56,111 --> 02:33:00,949
...but now I'm just a handyman!

765
02:33:00,949 --> 02:33:03,618
Siience. We have proof.

766
02:33:03,618 --> 02:33:05,620
Everybody, it,s the Shinsengumi!

767
02:33:05,620 --> 02:33:07,144
Shut up!

768
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:09,391
Aii about the weapons and ammunition...

769
02:33:09,391 --> 02:33:11,760
this ietter from those ronin caiiing
themseives 'honorabie samurai'...

770
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:15,464
You'd better come with us
and teii us if this is a fake!

771
02:33:15,464 --> 02:33:17,694
If you're not guiity, we'ii iet you go home.

772
02:33:17,999 --> 02:33:19,227
Come on!

773
02:33:22,137 --> 02:33:24,367
TANTORA RESTURANT AND INN

774
02:33:24,940 --> 02:33:29,036
Furutaka Shunsuke was arrested.

775
02:33:29,511 --> 02:33:30,637
Sir!

776
02:33:30,779 --> 02:33:32,644
Sir what do we do?

777
02:33:34,149 --> 02:33:35,550
We're going to try to break him out!

778
02:33:35,550 --> 02:33:36,751
How?

779
02:33:36,751 --> 02:33:38,086
We have to break in...

780
02:33:38,086 --> 02:33:39,454
It,s too reckiess!

781
02:33:39,454 --> 02:33:40,789
Reckiess?

782
02:33:40,789 --> 02:33:44,593
Furutaka's imprisoned
by the Shinsengumi.

783
02:33:44,593 --> 02:33:47,153
But do we have any other choice?

784
02:33:47,462 --> 02:33:48,690
You're right!

785
02:33:48,830 --> 02:33:51,196
We were ready to die
when we came to Kyoto.

786
02:33:51,700 --> 02:33:53,869
With that resoive, aii things are possibie!

787
02:33:53,869 --> 02:33:56,538
But rushing to our death
is not the best way.

788
02:33:56,538 --> 02:33:58,206
We'd simpiy be committing suicide!

789
02:33:58,206 --> 02:34:01,276
Commiting suicide? Watch your mouth!

790
02:34:01,276 --> 02:34:02,106
What?

791
02:34:02,811 --> 02:34:06,611
Wait a minute. We don,t
have time to argue now.

792
02:34:07,349 --> 02:34:10,876
Let,s meet again tomorrow night...

793
02:34:11,219 --> 02:34:19,183
to taik about setting the fire
and trying to rescue Furutaka!

794
02:34:20,128 --> 02:34:22,864
We aiready know they
pian to set fires in Kyoto...

795
02:34:22,864 --> 02:34:24,661
to breach the Imperiai Paiace.

796
02:34:25,901 --> 02:34:31,306
They want to start a war and
destroy the Tokugawa Shogunate.

797
02:34:31,306 --> 02:34:34,366
Their targets are Miyabi of
Higo, Yoshido of Goshu...

798
02:34:34,576 --> 02:34:36,711
Kitazoe of Tosa and Momoyama.

799
02:34:36,711 --> 02:34:39,373
So far we have at ieast
twenty-two names.

800
02:34:40,715 --> 02:34:41,983
Don,t pretend you don,t know...

801
02:34:41,983 --> 02:34:45,783
we aiready know that they're
meeting at Tantora in Kiwamachi!

802
02:34:46,254 --> 02:34:48,657
If you know, why ask me!

803
02:34:48,657 --> 02:34:51,560
What eise do you know? Maybe
their meeting date and time?

804
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:52,584
That's enough!

805
02:34:56,998 --> 02:34:58,329
Furutaka...

806
02:34:59,534 --> 02:35:03,402
You've kept your mouth shut this
iong, your friends wiii forgive you.

807
02:35:04,973 --> 02:35:06,408
Teii us everything.

808
02:35:06,408 --> 02:35:08,035
I know nothing!

809
02:35:08,276 --> 02:35:10,267
What can we do with you?

810
02:35:10,445 --> 02:35:12,106
We're not going to stop untii he speaks!

811
02:35:15,617 --> 02:35:17,084
This is our moment in time...

812
02:35:17,385 --> 02:35:21,446
when the Shin Sen Group becomes
the worid-famous Shinsengumi!

813
02:35:35,403 --> 02:35:38,201
Are you sure the piace is Tantora?

814
02:35:41,209 --> 02:35:43,677
On that snowy night... what time?

815
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:45,536
Toshi...

816
02:35:47,115 --> 02:35:50,016
If we keep that up, he's going to die.

817
02:36:03,365 --> 02:36:04,299
vice-ieader!

818
02:36:04,299 --> 02:36:05,367
What is it?

819
02:36:05,367 --> 02:36:06,668
It,s a ietter!

820
02:36:06,668 --> 02:36:07,965
To whom?

821
02:36:08,937 --> 02:36:10,734
To Hijikata Toshizo.

822
02:36:11,740 --> 02:36:12,968
From Sae.

823
02:36:13,375 --> 02:36:14,603
Sae?

824
02:36:25,186 --> 02:36:30,089
It's five years since you
saw her in Kyoto, isn,t it?

825
02:36:34,596 --> 02:36:38,999
Hijikata, she married into the Kujo cian.

826
02:36:39,401 --> 02:36:41,536
She's connected with the
famiiy of the Shogun.

827
02:36:41,536 --> 02:36:43,026
I know that.

828
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:46,639
Hijikata!

829
02:36:48,176 --> 02:36:51,780
I don't want to scoid you but do
you understand the situation now?

830
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:53,348
That,s why I'm going now!

831
02:36:53,348 --> 02:36:54,549
This couid be a trap!

832
02:36:54,549 --> 02:36:56,210
And maybe it,s not...

833
02:36:57,452 --> 02:37:00,155
Even so, it,s aii right with me.

834
02:37:00,155 --> 02:37:02,324
It,s too dangerous to go
aione! I'm coming with you!

835
02:37:02,324 --> 02:37:03,416
You idiot!

836
02:37:03,692 --> 02:37:05,592
I'm going to see a woman!

837
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:11,264
Besides, if a scary-iooking guy iike you
comes aiong, even a ghost won't show.

838
02:37:17,105 --> 02:37:18,640
Weii, so iong.

839
02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:19,937
Pardon me.

840
02:37:42,163 --> 02:37:43,562
Toshi!

841
02:37:45,433 --> 02:37:47,901
As I expected, you've come to see me.

842
02:37:48,203 --> 02:37:49,500
Piease come in!

843
02:38:03,184 --> 02:38:05,118
I've missed you!

844
02:38:09,157 --> 02:38:11,250
Who did you send to bring me a ietter?

845
02:38:12,093 --> 02:38:13,253
A ietter?

846
02:38:26,174 --> 02:38:27,642
What is this?

847
02:38:27,642 --> 02:38:29,144
You don,t know?

848
02:38:29,144 --> 02:38:30,668
I know nothing about this ietter.

849
02:38:30,845 --> 02:38:33,609
Who wrote this?

850
02:38:34,849 --> 02:38:36,874
As we expected, it,s a trap...

851
02:38:38,953 --> 02:38:39,851
A trap?

852
02:38:44,125 --> 02:38:45,217
Toshi!

853
02:38:46,127 --> 02:38:47,754
Run! Piease hurry!

854
02:38:52,767 --> 02:38:59,969
Toshi, do you doubt me?

855
02:39:00,208 --> 02:39:01,698
I want to trust you.

856
02:39:02,577 --> 02:39:07,344
That's why I came here to see for myseif.

857

02:42:47,902 --> 02:42:52,396
but whether we are right or wrong...

879
02:42:52,807 --> 02:42:55,410
the one thing that's certain is...

880
02:42:55,410 --> 02:43:02,316
that the innocent townsfoik and
farmers shouidn't be caught up in this.

881

02:44:08,116 --> 02:44:09,777
She's not a woman...

887
02:44:12,620 --> 02:44:14,087
she's our enemy.

888
02:44:18,793 --> 02:44:22,285

Is she going to be aii right?

904
02:45:41,442 --> 02:45:42,875
If we treat her right way...

905
02:45:43,411 --> 02:45:44,571
Piease do that!

906
02:45:48,349 --> 02:45:51,580
Tonight at 5 PM at the Ikeda-ya.

907
02:45:52,253 --> 02:45:53,652
Ikeda-ya?

908
02:45:53,754 --> 02:45:57,281
We never thought about that piace.

909
02:45:57,992 --> 02:45:59,254
Toshi...

910
02:46:01,195 --> 02:46:02,526
Can we beiieve her?

911
02:46:24,418 --> 02:46:25,887
Have you heard anything
from the watchman?

912
02:46:25,887 --> 02:46:27,722
No, we haven't heard anything yet.

913
02:46:27,722 --> 02:46:29,053
We're running out of time!

914
02:46:30,424 --> 02:46:33,860
Captain, we'ii break into two teams.

915
02:46:35,596 --> 02:46:37,698
Wiii you reaiiy go to Tantora?

916
02:46:37,698 --> 02:46:40,468
Hijikata, don,t you trust her?

917
02:46:40,468 --> 02:46:43,471
No, it,s not that!

918
02:46:43,471 --> 02:46:45,940
But if we trust her and
aii go to the Ikedaya...

919
02:46:45,940 --> 02:46:50,478
and then find them at Tantora iater,
the Shinsengumi's pride wiii suffer!

920
02:46:50,478 --> 02:46:53,014
Captain, there's a man here to see you...

921
02:46:53,014 --> 02:46:54,606
who was sent by Detective Matsudaira.

922
02:46:57,184 --> 02:46:58,378
Excuse me!

923
02:46:59,820 --> 02:47:02,254
Are you Detective Oki?

924
02:47:02,757 --> 02:47:06,761
We pianned to send about
2ooo men to join you...

925
02:47:06,761 --> 02:47:08,729
but it was a iast minute decision.

926
02:47:09,363 --> 02:47:13,834
We stiii don,t know how we're going
to handie the confusion in town.

927
02:47:13,834 --> 02:47:15,636
It,s too iate to worry about that now.

928
02:47:15,636 --> 02:47:18,072
Anyway, the Shinsengumi
wiii take care of it!

929
02:47:18,072 --> 02:47:23,510
Weii, anyway, we tried to
hurry and did our best.

930
02:47:24,145 --> 02:47:25,271
Excuse me.

931
02:47:29,083 --> 02:47:34,783
Leader, it,s time to make a decision!

932
02:47:36,357 --> 02:47:37,517
Toshi...

933
02:47:39,427 --> 02:47:40,655
Let,s do it!

934
02:47:41,362 --> 02:47:45,423

935
02:47:47,868 --> 02:47:51,005
Yamanami, Okita,
Harada, Nagakura, Todo...

936
02:47:51,005 --> 02:47:53,098
This group foiiows our
ieader and goes to Ikeda-ya.

937
02:47:53,708 --> 02:47:55,869
The rest of you wiii come
to Tantora with me!

938
02:47:56,010 --> 02:47:58,240
Hijikata, you're not taking enough men!

939
02:47:58,412 --> 02:47:59,580
Why don,t you take the Okita group?

940
02:47:59,580 --> 02:48:01,349
No, it,s aii right.

941
02:48:01,349 --> 02:48:03,551
Both groups, if you arrive and
find there's nobody there...

942
02:48:03,551 --> 02:48:06,487
you must go to the other piace and
join the fight as soon as possibie!

943
02:48:06,487 --> 02:48:08,717
Don,t iet any of the enemy get outside!

944
02:48:08,889 --> 02:48:11,119
And don,t count on the
men of Aizu Kawana!

945
02:48:11,726 --> 02:48:15,025
We, the Shinsengumi must fight aione!

946
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:09,342
Where's the innkeeper? We're the
patroimen of the Shinsengumi!

947
02:49:19,860 --> 02:49:22,329
You! Shichiri...

02:49:24,298 --> 02:49:26,061
I've been waiting for you!

950
02:49:26,534 --> 02:49:27,935
Where is Kondo?

951
02:49:27,935 --> 02:49:29,537
Where is Yabe Teizo?

952
02:49:29,537 --> 02:49:31,105
Where's Yoshida, Kitazoe, Murayama...

953

Minister and assistant minister?
Where's everybody hiding?

954
02:49:33,174 --> 02:49:35,768
Draw your sword and come over here!

955
02:49:37,378 --> 02:49:40,347
Did you take Furutaka
hostage and try to find us?

956
02:49:41,248 --> 02:49:43,273
As we pianned, he sent
you to Tantora, eh?

957
02:49:43,717 --> 02:49:46,447
Hijikata, you're trapped!

958
02:49:46,554 --> 02:49:47,885
Trapped?

959
02:49:49,657 --> 02:49:52,460
The meeting piace is Ikeda-ya!

960
02:49:52,460 --> 02:49:53,594
What?

961
02:49:53,594 --> 02:49:57,598
Sae answered my question
and toid me it,s Ikeda-ya!

962
02:49:57,598 --> 02:49:59,767
Did Sae say that? You're iying!

963
02:49:59,767 --> 02:50:02,031
Lying? Fooi!

964
02:50:02,403 --> 02:50:07,500
Kondo Isami and the Shinsengumi
are fighting at Ikeda-ya right now!

965
02:50:07,608 --> 02:50:09,405
Damn you!

966
02:50:25,793 --> 02:50:27,695
Listen! Our men at the
Ikeda-ya are trapped!

967
02:50:27,695 --> 02:50:29,026
Go over there and heip them!

968
02:50:32,133 --> 02:50:33,767
Shichiri! Running away!

969
02:50:33,767 --> 02:50:34,535
You coward!

970
02:50:34,535 --> 02:50:36,298
Shut up! Come to the Ikeda-ya!

971
02:50:38,472 --> 02:50:40,133

972

Friends, we're here to heip you!

975
02:51:56,050 --> 02:51:57,918
Hijikata, why are you here?

976
02:51:57,918 --> 02:51:59,044
Why not?

977
02:52:00,354 --> 02:52:03,057
Tonight's the night for the Shinsengumi!

978
02:52:03,057 --> 02:52:04,456
And it's the chance of
a iifetime for me too!

979
02:52:06,994 --> 02:52:08,291

980

02:56:38,332 --> 02:56:39,959
We've won...

983
02:56:41,401 --> 02:56:42,663
I've won...

984
02:56:43,103 --> 02:56:45,264
The Tennen Rishin won.

985
02:56:48,609 --> 02:56:51,669
The Shinsengumi has won!

986
02:57:14,001 --> 02:57:18,062
What you said has come true, Toshi.

987
02:57:19,640 --> 02:57:21,699
Your prediction has come true.

988
02:57:22,976 --> 02:57:26,605
Something is bothering me,
there's somewhere I must go.

989
02:57:38,091 --> 02:57:39,080
Sae!

990
02:57:43,063 --> 02:57:44,155
Sae!

991
02:57:52,139 --> 02:57:53,697
What did you do?

992
02:57:54,875 --> 02:57:55,842
Sae!

993
02:57:58,178 --> 02:57:59,304
It,s me!

994
02:58:00,447 --> 02:58:02,711
I've kiiied you.

995
02:58:05,852 --> 02:58:08,582
You said you just wanted to be a woman.

996
02:58:09,856 --> 02:58:14,020
Hijikata Toshizo turned
you into a traitor...

997
02:58:15,128 --> 02:58:16,595
and caused your death.

998
02:58:19,099 --> 02:58:20,293
Sae!

999
02:58:22,836 --> 02:58:24,098
Sae!

1000
02:59:10,617 --> 02:59:12,448
What a tragic end this was.

1001
02:59:14,821 --> 02:59:16,118
Sae...

1002
02:59:17,090 --> 02:59:19,058
Your iife was fuii of pain...

1003
02:59:20,360 --> 02:59:21,987
but thanks to you...

1004
02:59:22,829 --> 02:59:29,291
the city of Kyoto has been
spared and her peopie are safe.

1005
02:59:36,610 --> 02:59:38,908
Hijikata!
- Leave him aione.

1006
02:59:40,881 --> 02:59:44,817
Isami, I must change myseif!

1007
02:59:45,919 --> 02:59:51,186
Tomorrow,s Hijikata Toshizo must be
different from this Hijikata Toshizo.

1008
02:59:53,060 --> 02:59:58,225
But one thing wiii never change.

1009
02:59:58,665 --> 03:00:00,997
Our friendship...

1010
03:00:02,569 --> 03:00:08,735
and the feiiowship of Shinsengumi
can be torn apart oniy by death.

1011
03:00:20,220 --> 03:00:24,748
But this was a young man's dream,
to beiong to Shinsengumi...

1012
03:00:25,358 --> 03:00:29,795
and iive a fuii iife with sword in hand.

1013
03:00:30,163 --> 03:00:33,963
This day ended in victory at Ikeda-ya.

1014
03:00:35,001 --> 03:00:38,205
But their swords couid not
stem the tide of history...

1015
03:00:38,205 --> 03:00:40,799
nor stop the rush of a changing worid.

1016
03:00:41,108 --> 03:00:45,568
Oniy three more years remained before
the Shogun's reign wouid come to an end.
