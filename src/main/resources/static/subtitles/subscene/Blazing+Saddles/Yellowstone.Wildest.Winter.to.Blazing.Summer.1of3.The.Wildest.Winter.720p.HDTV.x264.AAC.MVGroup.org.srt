1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,040
Stretching out before me is the magnificent Yellowstone.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,520
This is one of the most dynamic...

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,600
..unpredictable and exciting environments on Earth.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Deep in the Rocky Mountains,

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,000
this vast wilderness

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,640
is home to North America's most iconic wildlife.

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,040
But every year, Yellowstone's animals

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,080
are pushed to their absolute limits.

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,520
Temperatures can swing from minus 40 in winter

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,880
to approaching plus 40 in summer

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,120
and at the heart of this change is the thaw.

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,440
This melt can last several months from March to July,

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,440
and is one of the most dramatic seasonal events on Earth.

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,560
How do the animals cope with such extremes of temperature?

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,200
We're here to find out.

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,200
I'm joined by biologist Patrick Aryee...

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,120
- Whew!
- That's intense.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,800
..and a team of wildlife cameramen and expert scientists.

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,240
I'll be following some of the area's key wildlife.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,040
We'll be getting to know families

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,920
through their highs and lows, starting right now.

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,000
And I'm looking at the bigger picture,

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,640
understanding the science of the thaw

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,960
during each season, across winter,

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,360
spring and summer.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,520
That's brilliant.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,520
Living here is tough.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,720
The changing climate has brought freak storms,

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,720
flash floods and raging fires,

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
making life for the animals even more extreme.

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,560
With unprecedented access to this remarkable place,

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,760
over the next three nights we're bringing you Yellowstone

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
as you've never seen it before.

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,680
Welcome to Yellowstone: The Wildest Winter.

35
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
WOLF HOWLS

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,360
It's early March.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,360
This is a world blanketed in thick snow and ice.

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,840
And after four long, hard months of winter,

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,400
the animals still have more weeks of brutal cold to endure.

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,480
We are in the north-west of the USA,

41
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,040
2,000 metres up in the Rockies.

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,600
This is an area known as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,640
It's the size of Scotland,

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,680
includes two national parks

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,600
and is bounded on three sides by mountain ranges.

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,840
In this programme,

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,320
we'll be following the lives of animals

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,000
that have to adapt to extreme change,

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,920
as winter turns into spring.

50
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,920
For many, this is the ultimate challenge...

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,480
..particularly for Yellowstone's biggest,

52
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,160
and, at this time of year, hungriest carnivores.

53
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,200
Patrick's heading high up into the mountains on their trail.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,440
It's amazing to think that somewhere out there are grizzly bears.

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,320
But it's right at the tail end of winter and it's really cold,

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,760
so most of those bears are still going to be hibernating in dens

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,960
deep beneath the snow.

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,680
And, for most, that's a sensible strategy.

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,720
Right now the weather is bitterly cold

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,560
and down to minus 21 Celsius up here.

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
It's usually later in March

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,160
that the majority of grizzlies start coming out.

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,040
I'm in the Gallatin Mountains

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,400
in the north-west of Yellowstone.

65
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,480
Our grizzly expert, Casey Anderson,

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,520
is out here monitoring bear activity.

67
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,040
- Hello, Casey. How are you doing, man?
- Good.

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,840
We're looking for any bears that are emerging from hibernation early,

69
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,320
and the most likely place to find them is at the higher elevations,

70
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,920
where grizzlies have their dens.

71
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
Good view, huh?

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
Absolutely stunning.

73
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,720
But it does look completely devoid of life.

74
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,720
How are we even going to start looking for these bears?

75
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,560
You're right, there's not much moving around out here.

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Right now the only bear that probably will be out

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,520
is those first big males.

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,960
Casey believes some grizzlies are already leaving their dens

79
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,200
because of a recent spell of unseasonably mild temperatures.

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,160
So, just a few days ago we had really warm weather,

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,440
it felt like spring.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
It's been so warm you've got to believe the bears are thinking

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
it's getting close to spring

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,880
and that can be really bad news, because it's not spring

85
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,720
and they come out here and winter can hit again

86
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,520
and that could really be devastating to a lot of animals,

87
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
including the bears.

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,440
Last week, right here, it was 15 degrees warmer than today.

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,640
Now it's back to more typical March conditions.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
Casey, this weather's pretty...

91
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
HE COUGHS

92
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,480
Whew!

93
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,280
- This is pretty intense. 
- That's intense.

94
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,040
How do the bears cope with this?

95
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,040
Bears are tough, but this is difficult for them, too.

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,760
Suddenly, Casey sees an opening that could be a bear den.

97
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,840
- You see, like, these natural rock formations.
- Oh, yeah.

98
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,840
- It's like a little cave.
- Yeah.

99
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,360
It's perched high on a steep slope.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,720
Not easy going.

101
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
The things I'll do for bears.

102
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,040
Would that be a good site for a bear to hibernate in?

103
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,480
The statistics are this -

104
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,560
70% of bears will dig in a north-faced slope.

105
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,200
At least 30% of this population does something else,

106
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,080
and something else is something like this.

107
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,760
Ready-made, in the sun,

108
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,760
they can get down in there and trap the heat.

109
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,080
It's perfect.

110
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,680
And it's not all one big sleep.

111
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,280
During hibernation, the pregnant females also give birth.

112
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,520
It's March now, and those little guys were born two months ago.

113
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,960
So, just imagine these little guys that big

114
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,880
and they're going to grow about that big in about another month.

115
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,640
And then in another month from now

116
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,800
they're going to pop their heads out, and this is going to be home.

117
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,120
It's just amazing, think about that, the first view.

118
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,640
It's a pretty good one.

119
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,920
We head off before we disturb any sleeping bears.

120
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,320
Emerging in these conditions would mean the odds are against them...

121
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,560
..and 50 miles further east that's exactly what's happened.

122
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Scientists have tipped off one of our camera teams

123
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,880
about a grizzly bear that has taken the risk of emerging early.

124
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,960
It's clearly struggling.

125
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,080
The warmer weather of a week ago

126
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,960
has been followed by plunging temperatures and more snow.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,480
This could make finding food impossible.

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,120
The grizzly finally makes it down from the mountains

129
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
to the valley floor.

130
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,520
There are plenty of bison here,

131
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,040
but even a starving bear won't tackle

132
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,880
these formidable beasts.

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,920
Bears rely heavily on their extraordinary sense of smell

134
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,320
to find food.

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
Their nose bristles with over a billion nerve cells.

136
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
It's their super sense...

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,320
..and it's led this bear to a pond.

138
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,520
A dip in the sub-zero water could zap his precious energy.

139
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,440
Grizzlies are superb at catching fish...

140
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,160
..but it's not fish he's after.

141
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,400
It's a bison.

142
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,800
Long dead, frozen all winter

143
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,880
and now released from its icy tomb.

144
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,480
This is probably the first meal the bear's eaten

145
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,040
in over four months.

146
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,720
It offers a huge protein hit...

147
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,520
..but he'll need to hang onto it.

148
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,080
The carcass's smell attracts scavengers.

149
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,920
These coyotes won't fight the bear -

150
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,320
he's 15 times their weight -

151
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,200
but they will harass him for scraps.

152
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,120
He tries to mask its scent by covering it with grass.

153
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,880
This will also slow down the bison's decay.

154
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,360
Having lost up to a third of his body weight during hibernation,

155
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,080
he's determined to keep these precious nutrients for himself.

156
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,960
Despite emerging from his den early,

157
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,560
this lone bear has hit the jackpot...

158
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
..but the stakes are high,

159
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,560
and the majority of grizzlies won't bother venturing out

160
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,280
until the consistent warm weather of spring.

161
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,000
But that still seems a long way off.

162
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,160
The snow shows no sign of letting up.

163
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,320
All the animals here face the same basic challenge -

164
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,400
finding enough food to survive until spring.

165
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Our crews are out across the region

166
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,160
to capture the stories of how the wildlife is coping

167
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,760
in these last days of winter.

168
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,640
Yellowstone's elevated position and horseshoe of mountains

169
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,640
channel and trap the cold air driving in from the north,

170
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,400
and moisture coming in from the Pacific Ocean.

171
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,200
This leads to prolonged periods of extreme weather.

172
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,880
When the snow melts in spring,

173
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,960
it feeds into a thousand rivers and streams across Yellowstone.

174
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,040
These 2,500 miles of running water are hugely important,

175
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
not just for Yellowstone,

176
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,720
but they provide an essential resource

177
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,120
for millions of people and animals

178
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,720
right across the Western United States.

179
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,960
Scientists constantly monitor how much snow is building up here

180
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,320
during the winter.

181
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,920
To understand what's going on this year,

182
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,960
I am joining a team up in the Beartooth Mountains

183
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,960
in the north-east on their cool commute to work.

184
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,960
This is possibly the best office I have ever been to.

185
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000
THEY LAUGH

186
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,080
This looks like a pretty good spot.

187
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,640
Oh, wow.

188
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,600
It's right at about 205 centimetres.

189
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,640
OK.

190
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Lucas Zukiewicz is one of the hydrologists

191
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,360
who spends the winter carrying out health checks on the snow.

192
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,120
Our entire history of our snowpack,

193
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,720
starting mid-October,

194
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,920
is really in this snowpack here.

195
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,840
So we are going to dig a hole down into the ground,

196
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,080
and it is pretty much the coolest layer cake

197
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
that you're ever going to see.

198
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,400
LAUGHING: I love that.

199
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,320
I have a feeling that I might be here for months.

200
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,520
Right, OK. So...

201
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,840
Yeah, I've hit grass!

202
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
That is so cool.

203
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,040
I have to say, coming from a country where, you know,

204
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,240
if you get four centimetres of snow it's newsworthy,

205
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,880
to look at that and to kind of understand

206
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,600
that that is a record of your winter, that's quite cool, isn't it?

207
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,920
It's amazing. And the best part of this job is it's never the same.

208
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,040
Every year is different.

209
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,400
It's like hitting the reset button on it every year.

210
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,520
So it's time for us to analyse what the snowpack can tell us.

211
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,840
So, looking at it from bottom to top, here,

212
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
we are looking at a time series.

213
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
So we have our early season, October snowfall,

214
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,000
probably our Thanksgiving and Christmas snowfall

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,280
- that we have here. 
- You had a white Christmas?

216
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,520
We had a white Christmas this year, it was great.

217
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,560
Various measurements enable Lucas and his team

218
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,640
to work out how much snow is building up here,

219
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,040
and how dense it is.

220
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,280
The texture of it here is completely different.

221
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,720
It feels much more compact, exactly as when we were digging it out.

222
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,760
The density reflects how much water is contained in each layer

223
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,320
of the snowpack and that varies

224
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,560
depending on the temperature when the snow fell.

225
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,840
Maybe we see some pretty well bonded snow in here,

226
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,240
which is generally an indication of warm temperatures.

227
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
- OK.
- Warm temperatures actually bond the snow pretty well together.

228
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,640
First of all, we're going to stick one right up here

229
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,880
on the surface of the snow.

230
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,720
Measuring the temperature is also key in helping to predict

231
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,200
when the bulk of the water will flood down into the valleys.

232
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,520
The next one at 170,

233
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,160
we are going to stick that right below

234
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,800
that little crust layer that we saw.

235
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,400
And these readings also provide clues

236
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,160
as to why some mammals hibernate deep in the snow.

237
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,800
Stick it right in the ground.

238
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,920
In the grass.

239
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,800
So, we can see here that our snow surface temperature -

240
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,080
what does that one say?

241
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,520
I would say minus eight.

242
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,280
But as we move further down the snowpack...

243
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,840
- It's warmer!
- It's warmer, it's minus three degrees.

244
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,160
That's mad.

245
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,120
OK. And if we go even closer to the ground...

246
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,480
It's almost on zero.

247
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,040
Yep - so, the ground is generally close to zero degrees Celsius

248
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,760
through the winter, so the snowpack is also insulating the soil.

249
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,360
But it also makes sense,

250
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,000
when you look at something like a grizzly bear

251
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,880
hibernating in the winter beneath the snow -

252
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,280
I now understand why it chooses to hibernate there,

253
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,440
because it's warmer.

254
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,720
Snow caves are pretty warm.

255
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,160
That's brilliant.

256
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,120
This insulating effect

257
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,040
not only allows bears to hibernate in snow dens,

258
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,160
it keeps the grass alive.

259
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Vital food for herbivores

260
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,440
and whilst it may look just like a white wall,

261
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,600
we're actually looking at an enormous reservoir.

262
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,280
When the weather warms up enough to heat the snowpack right through...

263
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,080
..billions of litres of water run off the mountains

264
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,720
into the rivers and lakes of Yellowstone.

265
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,520
Is the timing of the thaw important for you?

266
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
It is, because it affects when we see the bulk of the water

267
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,560
- move into our river systems.
- Right.

268
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,680
This is our reservoir that we have in our mountains,

269
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,400
this is how we get our water, this is how it flows through the park.

270
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,280
So, do you think when the thaw comes,

271
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,720
it's going to be a normal year,

272
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
or an abnormal year?

273
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
We are slightly below average

274
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,600
with the snowpack that we have here in place, at this elevation,

275
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,640
but really it is going to be the next month or two

276
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
and the weather that we experience

277
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,080
that is going to dictate what we see this year in terms of our thaw,

278
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,680
and how that impacts the bigger ecosystem.

279
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880
It will be interesting to see what happens in the coming weeks,

280
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,480
as the weather has already proved highly volatile this winter.

281
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,440
There was a jump in temperatures

282
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,000
and an unusually warm period at the end of February.

283
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,880
March has now seen a return to the colder,

284
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,200
more typical weather for this time of year.

285
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,760
In recent years,

286
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,520
Yellowstone has experienced milder winters more often

287
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,360
and this one appears to be following that trend.

288
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,280
Patrick has headed south to see how the temperature jumps this year

289
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,920
are affecting another iconic species.

290
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,720
Snow is a lot more complex than it looks,

291
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,160
and for one animal, a bird of prey,

292
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
the precise depth and type of snow

293
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,040
can literally mean the difference between life and death.

294
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,680
This is the great grey owl,

295
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,400
one of the largest owls in the world,

296
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,360
with a wingspan that stretches up to 1.5 metres.

297
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,080
It's a winter specialist.

298
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,920
It survives in some of the coldest forests on earth,

299
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,160
from Siberia to Scandinavia...

300
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,240
..to here, in north-west America.

301
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,640
Researchers believe several hundred great grey owls

302
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,160
live in the Jackson Hole Valley,

303
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,160
all within 150 square miles of forest.

304
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
Our cameraman, Jeff Hogan,

305
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,320
has had a lifelong love affair with this enigmatic bird.

306
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,520
I've been following and filming the great grey owls

307
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,680
for just about 30 years now.

308
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,880
It's still just as exciting and challenging

309
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,920
as it was the very first day.

310
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,040
This is a fantastic place for owls to be hanging out.

311
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,520
I mean, it is mixed aspens and conifer forest,

312
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,560
along with these meadows,

313
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,960
provide an incredible habitat for the prey that the owl feeds upon.

314
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,320
Great greys feed on rodents -

315
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,920
mainly gophers and voles - that burrow under the snow.

316
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,760
Their huge facial discs act like satellite dishes,

317
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,680
directing sound to their ears.

318
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,640
Their hearing is exceptional.

319
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,640
They can detect prey from over 100 metres away,

320
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,520
through snow almost half a metre deep.

321
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,160
But it is one thing knowing where to pounce,

322
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,640
another to break through to reach the meal.

323
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,480
Jeff is out looking for them.

324
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,320
He is concerned that, with the erratic weather conditions,

325
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,680
the owls face a big challenge.

326
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,600
Earlier this week we got a lot of snow, and then the skies cleared,

327
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,560
so you can look around here and see where the sun is beating down

328
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,200
on the surface of this snowpack, and it really softens it up.

329
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,960
It doesn't melt completely, but it makes it really soft and wet,

330
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,600
and then at night, when the temperatures plummet,

331
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,920
it will freeze hard and turn it to ice.

332
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,320
You can actually see this layer of crust.

333
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,240
You can really feel that.

334
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,560
Ouch.

335
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,120
This is hard.

336
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,680
And as the temperatures drop as night approaches,

337
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,880
this is going to get harder and harder,

338
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,000
and these owls have to bust through this crust,

339
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,320
and there may be another foot of snow to get to their prey.

340
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,160
Jeff hasn't seen any great greys,

341
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,720
which could mean they have been forced further afield to hunt.

342
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,800
So, I guess I'm going to have to keep on looking.

343
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,280
At this time of year, eating enough food is critical.

344
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,200
If the great grey owls can't hunt, they simply won't lay eggs,

345
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,080
or even nest this season.

346
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,280
Their population is already small and vulnerable.

347
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,760
Biologist Katherine Gura is keen to see how current snow conditions

348
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,240
might be impacting the owls' ability to feed

349
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
and that involves a simple experiment.

350
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,960
Katherine, you are stood out here with a ruler, a metre rule,

351
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,440
and these flasks of water.

352
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,760
What do these have to do with owls?

353
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,000
So, this is about the same weight as a great grey owl.

354
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,200
So, what we are doing is dropping these,

355
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,720
and we are seeing how far they penetrate the snow.

356
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,000
Because it in turn can show us how easy or hard it is

357
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,360
for great grey owls to penetrate the snow to get to their prey.

358
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,560
- Right, Katherine, can I give you a hand?
- Absolutely.

359
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,760
OK, so what do I do?

360
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,360
So you want to drop that from one metre above the snow.

361
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,640
- OK.
- So that's here.

362
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,760
- One metre, that's here.
- Yeah.

363
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,600
OK, so it hasn't really gone that far. It's gone about...

364
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,240
17 centimetres.

365
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,320
With their prey often underneath twice as much snow,

366
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,480
this is why the owls are having trouble feeding.

367
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,040
Our concern is that it is changing the timing of their behaviour.

368
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,640
So if there's not enough prey,

369
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,280
I mean, that's probably going to spell disaster.

370
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,680
- Are you worried about that? 
- I definitely am.

371
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,840
I've been working with these owls for years.

372
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,160
I love watching them throughout their nesting season,

373
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,440
and it really concerns me

374
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,120
if they are not going to be able to have enough prey

375
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,560
to even attempt to nest, or to eventually support the young.

376
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,480
This year, with the tricky snow conditions,

377
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,360
the owls appear to be suffering.

378
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,400
To find out how they are really getting on,

379
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,040
or indeed if they are around at all,

380
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,080
Katherine needs to conduct her survey at night.

381
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,040
The night-time call of the great grey owl

382
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,000
is one of the early signs of spring,

383
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,360
and, for scientists, this is the first time

384
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,400
they will be able to work out exactly where they are,

385
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,920
what they're up to, and how they are doing.

386
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,680
If the great greys are going to be successful in raising chicks,

387
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,720
they should be out there right now,

388
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,120
and we hopefully should be able to hear them,

389
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,640
but the thing is, this year, nothing is certain.

390
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,800
Jeff has also joined us.

391
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,360
He is hoping his luck finding owls will change

392
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,440
under the cover of darkness.

393
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,720
The survey area covers several square miles.

394
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,400
Now, my top speed in snow shoes is half a mile per hour.

395
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
This could be a long night.

396
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,600
All right, this looks like a good spot to stop and survey.

397
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,320
OK, so what are we going to do?

398
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,520
So I will do the male territorial call,

399
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
and then we want to be as quiet as possible,

400
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,440
and we'll listen to see if one responds.

401
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,760
- Right, so, fingers crossed we get an owl.
- OK.

402
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,040
I'll do my best.

403
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,400
SHE MIMICS OWL HOOT

404
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,360
OWL RESPONDS

405
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,000
Yep, that's it.

406
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,440
Right here. Yeah, this is great.

407
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,480
OWL HOOTS

408
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,240
It's responding.

409
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,360
So, is that probably a male?

410
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,840
So, that's a male territorial call.

411
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,520
So they will do that, either to attract a mate,

412
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,680
and also to tell other males that this is his zone, his territory.

413
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
Should I give it a go?

414
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
You should do it.

415
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,280
HE HOOTS

416
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,520
No, that's too deep!

417
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,920
See if he likes it.

418
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,720
HE HOOTS

419
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,240
Mine's too manly.

420
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,920
You've scared it off.

421
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,840
He doesn't want to get beat up!

422
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,120
So, given the conditions that we're having this year,

423
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,800
this is a really good sign,

424
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,160
- that we can hear the great grey owls.
- Mm-hm.

425
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,920
I was definitely worried, with kind of the hard crust that we have had,

426
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,800
that they might not be on territory yet,

427
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,200
but it is a good sign that they are here and defending it.

428
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
OWL HOOTS

429
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
So, there are males out there

430
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,080
and they're defending their territory.

431
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,560
Given this year's unpredictable weather, it's a promising sign.

432
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,440
Jeff and Katherine will continue monitoring,

433
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,400
and we'll be back to see how the owls are getting on

434
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,240
later in the season.

435
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,440
All across the region,

436
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,800
the challenge for much of the wildlife

437
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,920
is simply to hang on until spring.

438
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,640
It may appear that animals like bison

439
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,320
spend the winter stoically struggling through the snow,

440
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,440
but there is a respite for some...

441
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,600
..and it's thanks to a feature that is synonymous with Yellowstone.

442
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,280
It's famed not just for its landscapes and its wildlife,

443
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,080
but also for its geology.

444
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,960
Yellowstone has more geysers than anywhere else.

445
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,520
In fact, 60% of all the geysers anywhere in the world are here,

446
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,040
and the reason for that is a giant magma chamber,

447
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,480
literally a pool, a sort of lake of molten rock,

448
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,360
sitting just below the Earth's crust,

449
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,760
literally right under my feet here.

450
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,840
Scientists believe there's enough magma down below

451
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,320
to fill the Grand Canyon more than 11 times,

452
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,400
and in West Yellowstone,

453
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,760
there's plenty of evidence of all this geothermal activity,

454
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,640
particularly with the dramatic geysers.

455
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,200
These hot springs intermittently send fountains of water and steam

456
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,960
into the air.

457
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,440
It looks a fairly inhospitable landscape,

458
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,880
but around 200 bison spend the winter living and feeding here.

459
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,120
These bison are part of what is known as the central herd,

460
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,520
and they don't need to work really so hard to get at the vegetation

461
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
beneath the snow.

462
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,600
The earth here is warmed by that magma chamber

463
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,240
bubbling away beneath the crust,

464
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,520
and that means there's far less snow,

465
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,840
and the vegetation is much easier to get at.

466
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,760
But scientists have discovered that these easy pickings

467
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,680
come at a high price.

468
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,840
The hot water pushing up from deep underground

469
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,720
dissolves the chemical compound silica from the volcanic rock,

470
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,960
and deposits it on the grass.

471
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Now, silica coats the vegetation around geysers and hot springs,

472
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,360
and it's a little bit like eating something

473
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,760
that has been covered in a very fine dusting of ground glass.

474
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,800
It's enormously abrasive and very, very tough on the teeth.

475
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,480
The other issue is the high levels of fluoride in the water.

476
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,120
This chemical is a by-product of historic volcanic eruptions.

477
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,360
In low doses, such as in toothpaste, it's good for your teeth,

478
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,840
but here it's so concentrated it actually softens,

479
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,080
rather than strengthens, the enamel.

480
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,960
Now, the combination of silica and an excess of fluoride in their diet,

481
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,040
means that the bison down here lose their teeth

482
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,280
significantly earlier than the bison up in the north of the park.

483
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,240
In fact, life expectancy amongst this herd

484
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,200
is at least five years less.

485
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,760
So, although these bison have an easier life

486
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,800
than their snowbound cousins,

487
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
it's definitely a much shorter one.

488
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,160
Finally, by mid-March,

489
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,080
other parts of Yellowstone also get a reprieve from deep snow.

490
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,240
It's melting faster than it's falling.

491
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,600
Warmer air has come up from the south

492
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,840
and pushed out the cold front in the north.

493
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,400
Daytime temperatures rise above freezing, unlocking the rivers...

494
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,920
..and the animals make the most of it.

495
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,240
Underwater plants are more nutritious

496
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,200
than those beneath the snow,

497
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,040
and are a vital food source for this moose,

498
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,680
which needs to pile on the pounds fast.

499
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,240
This muskrat is enjoying the vegetation, too.

500
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,400
His double layer of waterproof fur keeps him warm and dry,

501
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,120
even whilst eating on an icy platform...

502
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,160
..and, when he dives down, his lips seal shut

503
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,400
behind his big rodent teeth,

504
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,920
so that he can gather food without swallowing water.

505
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,280
Even a winter casualty is good news.

506
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,200
This elk carcass will sustain many scavengers over the coming days...

507
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,320
..and it may be here

508
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,720
thanks to Yellowstone's most charismatic predator.

509
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,680
HOWLING

510
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,440
SHE GASPS: Oh, my God, look at the wolves!

511
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,800
This is the most...

512
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,320
This is the most incredible view!

513
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,600
What becomes so evident when you see a pack of wolves

514
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,160
running across the snow like that

515
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,720
is just how perfectly adapted they are as winter predators.

516
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,800
There are some things that...

517
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,400
in life that floor you,

518
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,520
and seeing a pack of wolves...

519
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,040
I am completely, completely overwhelmed by the sight!

520
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,520
To see what effect this year's thaw is having on these animals,

521
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,120
I'm joining wolf biologist Doug Smith.

522
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,440
We're on our way up a ridge on Blacktail Butte

523
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,920
in the Northern Range,

524
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,600
home to a pack of 11 individuals

525
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,680
that lay claim to a territory of 250 square miles.

526
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,120
Doug and his team constantly monitor the wolves in Yellowstone.

527
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,200
He's concerned that climate change is having an impact on them.

528
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,120
They just ooze charisma, don't they?

529
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,320
Even 2km away.

530
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,120
It's true.

531
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,920
There's something enchanting and mysterious about them

532
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,640
that has gone through the ages.

533
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,400
Usually wolves thrive in the winter.

534
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,120
They are snow specialists.

535
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,160
Their feet fan out,

536
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,000
enabling them to run across deep snow at over 25mph.

537
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,360
This gives them an advantage over their prey, elk and bison...

538
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,600
..which struggle with their cloven hooves.

539
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,880
Wolves generally have even more of an edge in March,

540
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,080
when Yellowstone's herbivores are weak and hungry...

541
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
..but this year is different.

542
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,960
By Yellowstone's extreme standards,

543
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,000
2016 has been one of the mildest winters

544
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,640
ever recorded.

545
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,320
Temperatures have fluctuated wildly,

546
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,120
but, overall, they've hovered three degrees

547
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,920
above the historic average.

548
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,120
A warmer winter is great for herbivores

549
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,680
as there is less snow,

550
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,000
and they are less likely to die of cold...

551
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,240
..but for their predators, Yellowstone's wolves,

552
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,640
it can make life a lot more difficult.

553
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,120
Because this winter has been so mild,

554
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,280
do you think that that is going to have a big impact on these wolves?

555
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,680
It certainly could.

556
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,640
I mean, hard winters wear your prey down,

557
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,480
and that makes them easier to kill for wolves.

558
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,880
A mild winter, their prey is going to do a little bit better.

559
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,560
This winter was warmer and, with below-average snowfall,

560
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,760
and it is early to tell what the effect of that is,

561
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,760
but we think that wolf food consumption rates, kill rates,

562
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,680
are down because of that.

563
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,520
So these milder winters favour the prey,

564
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,120
and so does that mean fewer pups?

565
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,960
Which leads to smaller packs.

566
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,720
This changing winter weather could be a huge impact.

567
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,440
Wolf kill rates are down this year,

568
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,080
but our camera teams across the region

569
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,280
have caught some hunts on film.

570
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,440
Perhaps there will be clues

571
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,160
as to the problems wolves are facing right now.

572
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,440
Talk me through what's going on here.

573
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,680
I mean, that's classic wolf hunting behaviour.

574
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,120
What wolves are looking for are behavioural cues

575
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,440
that indicate to them that there is a weak bison.

576
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,720
- Right.
- But what's interesting is, the bison are staying in these areas

577
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,800
where there is either no snow or little snow,

578
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,200
- because they have got firm footing and they feel confident.
- Yeah.

579
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,320
And so what the wolves are doing is trying to bump them into a place

580
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,160
that's more favourable to them, ie, deeper snow.

581
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,520
- This winter there's less deep snow...
- Right.

582
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,120
..so the wolves are having a harder time.

583
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,480
Plus, these brown places have forage for the bison to eat

584
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,800
- so they're going to be healthier. 
- Yeah.

585
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,640
That's also bad for the wolves.

586
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,400
The next hunt involves the wolves' main winter prey, the elk.

587
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,040
- Now, here is an elk encounter... 
- Yeah.

588
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,480
..and this is even more dramatic.

589
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,120
- Look at that! 
- This female elk is very healthy,

590
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,160
and she is actually attacking the wolf,

591
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,840
- but she won't leave the dry ground. 
- Yeah.

592
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,080
Classic example of the importance of snow depth and footing.

593
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,320
Look at the elk. Healthy elk will always outrun a healthy wolf.

594
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,760
So, talking to the old-timers who lived here in Yellowstone

595
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,280
during the 1960s and 1970s, every winter was a deep snow winter.

596
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,160
It was the rare winter that was not much snow.

597
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,920
Now, it's the rare winter where you have deep snow.

598
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,200
It is more common to have shallow snow,

599
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,760
and that's switching this balance between predators and prey.

600
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,640
With so few successful hunts,

601
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,120
scientists have noticed that some of the wolves

602
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,160
are turning to a summer feeding strategy.

603
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,520
Instead of working as a pack, they're hunting alone,

604
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,480
digging into burrows to catch small mammals.

605
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,680
It's much less rewarding, much harder work,

606
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,640
and, for this time of the year, definitely unusual.

607
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,080
The repercussions could be huge.

608
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,560
The female wolves are pregnant right now,

609
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,960
and poor feeding may lead to weaker pups.

610
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,160
We won't know until early summer.

611
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,040
It's the end of March.

612
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,120
The signs of spring are getting stronger every day.

613
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,640
I guess I weigh more than a coyote.

614
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,280
With temperatures warming,

615
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,640
many more grizzlies are coming out of their dens.

616
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,600
Our bear expert, Casey Anderson, is out searching for them

617
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,560
up in the Gallatin Mountains.

618
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,800
Sometimes it's not that hard

619
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,320
to work out where they've passed through.

620
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,360
Hey, look.

621
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,760
You can see, right here, it's all kind of worn out,

622
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,640
you can see these little claw marks.

623
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,400
Well, sometimes when the bears come out of the den,

624
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,920
they can be a little mischievous.

625
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,360
If you look right here,

626
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,120
one of the first stops the bear had made was this snowmobile seat.

627
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,800
Just ripping, clawing, biting, just playing, really.

628
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,080
It's part of living in grizzly country.

629
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,840
It is never certain when bears will emerge in Yellowstone,

630
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,160
but this year has been more unpredictable than ever.

631
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,920
It's been, really, a strange year so far.

632
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,080
The spring temperature

633
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
has definitely gotten a few bears up earlier,

634
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,160
we know that one bear has gone down,

635
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,320
pulled that bison carcass out of the pond.

636
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,200
That was a risk worth taking.

637
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,400
But it was a risk.

638
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,320
Other early grizzlies may not have been so lucky.

639
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,080
The adaptations animals make in Yellowstone

640
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,080
to chime with its extreme seasonal changes

641
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,640
are finely balanced,

642
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,200
and in tune not just with temperature

643
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,960
and degree of snow cover,

644
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,200
but also with length of day.

645
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,840
Right up here, there's a long-tail weasel.

646
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,720
It's running around right up here.

647
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,200
So, these long-tail weasels, as soon as spring actually is here,

648
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,440
they will turn brown,

649
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,160
and they'll be camouflaged for the spring, summer and fall.

650
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,800
When winter comes again, they turn white, just like this.

651
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,560
The fact that he's still completely white

652
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,520
shows that it is very much winter.

653
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,240
The changing colour is triggered by hours of daylight,

654
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,720
not by temperature.

655
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,920
He won't turn brown until next month.

656
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,920
And just like the fox and the coyotes,

657
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,280
he's looking for all the rodents that live underneath the snow cover.

658
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,200
He's just tunnelling down, going and grabbing these things,

659
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,720
and popping up and eating them.

660
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,880
But whilst he is still white, if the snow melts too quickly,

661
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,400
he'll lose his camouflage advantage,

662
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,800
and could be at risk from predators himself.

663
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,120
And one mammal who would happily eat him is a fox.

664
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,320
You can see this, like, little story unfolding here.

665
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,120
This is a fox doing what they're so good at in winter time.

666
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,520
A bear's greatest sense is their sense of smell,

667
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,440
whereas a fox's greatest sense is their sense of hearing.

668
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,440
And they literally hear a little rodent way down in the snow,

669
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,120
they'll stop, and you'll see them,

670
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,000
they'll do this thing where they pitch their head side to side,

671
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,280
and what they are doing is really triangulating

672
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,960
and zoning in to the exact location of that rodent,

673
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,480
and then they just do this giant leap up in the air

674
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,200
and get this momentum with gravity, and just, poof!

675
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,360
Right down into the snow,

676
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,520
and grab that little guy.

677
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,080
He doesn't even know he's coming.

678
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
He thinks he's down there, all protected.

679
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,560
Little does he know, up there is a fox.

680
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,960
A missile coming straight down and getting him

681
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,360
and look at that, that's quite a ways down.

682
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,440
A little vole is a pretty good snack for a fox.

683
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,000
Whereas for a bear, it is nothing,

684
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,640
there's no way it could survive on voles alone through the winter,

685
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,520
so that's why they choose to hibernate,

686
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,320
there's nothing out here to eat if you're a big old...

687
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,000
bumbling-around bear.

688
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,680
- PATRICK:
- Down in the south, there is also still plenty of snow

689
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,160
in the forest habitat of the great grey owl.

690
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,800
Cameraman Jeff Hogan has been out night and day tracking them

691
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,120
to find out whether they're breeding successfully.

692
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,240
We have an owl.

693
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,120
Jeff's been hearing and seeing the male owls consistently,

694
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,000
which is a reassuring sign.

695
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,040
He'd feared they might have left the area due to a lack of food.

696
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,640
We're going to set up here.

697
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,400
This year, the issue has been icy snow.

698
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,120
It's prevented the great grey owls snow-plunging deep enough

699
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,720
to catch their prey.

700
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,840
The owls each need at least one rodent a day,

701
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,640
and if they don't eat enough now, they just won't breed.

702
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,680
He didn't catch anything.

703
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,360
There's something right here underneath him,

704
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,720
because he's back.

705
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,800
He's going to make another attempt.

706
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,280
Oh, he jumped.

707
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,280
Oh, he's on the ground now.

708
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,440
I don't think he got anything.

709
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,600
He just flew up with nothing.

710
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,760
I've been here since dawn and he hasn't caught anything yet today.

711
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,240
It appears the owls are still struggling.

712
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,560
Then, at last, a sign of hope.

713
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,920
A female arrives.

714
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,160
This could get exciting. We've got two great greys right here.

715
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:52,960
Following one bird is pretty exciting, but to have two birds...

716
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,120
..it's amazing, it really is amazing.

717
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,480
Let's see what goes on.

718
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,080
Oh, here, he's flying in.

719
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,280
Oh!

720
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,720
Mating. Mating!

721
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,000
Oh, my.

722
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,040
I've never seen this before.

723
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,040
This is great news.

724
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,200
It's incredible, absolutely incredible.

725
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,840
For the end of March,

726
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,240
courtship, mating.

727
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,200
The next step is nesting.

728
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,800
Eventually, the pair choose to nest on an old, broken spruce trunk.

729
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,880
How many eggs are laid will depend on how much food the owls consumed

730
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,120
earlier in the season.

731
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,920
On average, they lay four,

732
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,360
but this year, it could be less.

733
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,960
We will be following them to see what happens.

734
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,440
It's now April and the temperatures are warming up.

735
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,040
This is Jackson Lake in the Tetons,

736
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,120
and normally it would be frozen well into May,

737
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,240
but already the ice is breaking up.

738
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,120
The arrival of the melt is a tipping point

739
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,520
for the wildlife of Yellowstone,

740
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,880
and this year, after an extremely mild winter,

741
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,000
it's three weeks early.

742
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,200
At long last, though, it's official - spring is here.

743
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,320
As the days get longer, the sun is higher in the sky,

744
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,240
and its increased energy melts the snow and raises daily temperatures.

745
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,720
Although there's still snow on the ground,

746
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,160
the warming temperatures are actually changing the shape

747
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,720
of the crystals within the snow pack.

748
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,160
Now, they've turned into tight little balls,

749
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,560
and there's a lot of water in between them,

750
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,600
so the packs become a lot slushier.

751
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,840
It's literally at melting point.

752
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,880
All this snow is just water in waiting.

753
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,720
Millions of tonnes will gradually melt,

754
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,400
flooding into the lakes and rivers of north-west America.

755
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,960
It's a process that will continue until July.

756
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,680
It's the valleys that lose their snow first,

757
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,520
and then, finally, the mountain peaks release their huge reservoir.

758
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,600
Soon, these warmer temperatures will lure the last male grizzlies

759
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,320
out of hibernation...

760
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,400
..and, with the snow retreating,

761
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,720
plants, too, are bursting into life.

762
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,480
A nutritious feast for hungry bears.

763
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,160
Patrick's back in the Gallatin Mountains with Casey Anderson

764
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,280
to find out why a top predator

765
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,880
sometimes chooses the vegetarian option.

766
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,200
Look right here.

767
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,720
This is biscuit root.

768
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,880
This is a grizzly favourite.

769
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,960
Bears are omnivores.

770
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,440
They don't just survive on meat.

771
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,560
Their diet also includes insects, fungi, and lots of vegetation.

772
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,680
Many bears time their emergence

773
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,360
to coincide with biscuit root coming into flower.

774
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,840
So, that is what they're looking for, right there.

775
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,480
This bit of root at the bottom.

776
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,920
There's tonnes of calories in it.

777
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,160
So how much biscuit root do they have to get through?

778
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,120
I've watched them eat hundreds if not thousands of these roots.

779
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,520
- What does it taste like? 
- You tell me.

780
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,640
I was afraid you were going to say that, but I'm up to the challenge.

781
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,680
Bottoms up.

782
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,040
- It's like carrots.
- Yeah.

783
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,400
Yeah, like a kind of starchy carrot.

784
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,040
Yeah. To be honest with you, when I'm hiking around out here,

785
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,400
sometimes I look in my backpack and see what I have for lunch,

786
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,920
and I look on the ground, and I'm like,

787
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,840
"I'm going to go grizzly-style here and start digging away."

788
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,560
As they put on weight after the winter,

789
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,520
and more grizzlies come out,

790
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,480
they begin to communicate with each other.

791
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,840
Each male can have a home range of over several hundred square miles,

792
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,520
and they need to work out who else is out there on their patch.

793
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,120
So, this is an old backcountry camp in here,

794
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,960
people come up and camp from time to time,

795
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,480
there's a little tent over here,

796
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,640
and this old outhouse,

797
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,840
that tree right next to it is the rub tree

798
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,000
where these big males will rub their back

799
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,880
and urinate all over the place, right by the outhouse.

800
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,240
So it's a bear toilet?

801
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,200
It really is.

802
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,680
- Look, see these big claws right here.
- Wow.

803
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,440
And look right here, Patrick,

804
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,400
where the sap has stuck all the hair...

805
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,520
- Oh, yeah.
- ..stuck to the tree. All down to here.

806
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,440
So, all this here,

807
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,120
this is...

808
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,960
- bear hair.
- Yeah.

809
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,640
So, what they do, they come over,

810
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,320
and they just usually come up and put their back on the tree,

811
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,480
and they'll rub their scent all over it,

812
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,880
and they reach up and grab like this, and they bite the tree.

813
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,640
Then they drop down, particularly the males,

814
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,120
and they do this thing that I call the cowboy walk.

815
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,880
So, they just stick it and they twist their feet like this.

816
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,640
PATRICK CHUCKLES

817
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,280
They have real rigid legs, and they're just really twisting.

818
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,320
So each bear that comes to this tree will step in that same exact spot.

819
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,840
And they do it over and over again.

820
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,240
It leaves these big divots in the ground.

821
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,800
So, if you're a smaller bear

822
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,760
and you really have to reach for that next foot divot,

823
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,960
you know there's a bigger bear in town.

824
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,480
This is a well-known rub tree.

825
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,840
We're setting up a camera

826
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,280
to see how many of the big males are out there.

827
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,080
- See this right here?
- Right.

828
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,760
It's going to take a recording,

829
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,960
and it's going to text me to my cellphone.

830
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,560
- No way.
- Yeah, real-time.

831
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,960
So, as soon as a bear's there, I'm getting a text.

832
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,560
So, hang on. You're going to get a text from a bear?

833
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,360
Exactly, that's exactly what's going to happen.

834
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,400
A few days later, Casey has called me in to look at the results.

835
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,040
Right, what have we got? Let's take a look and see what it's caught.

836
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,400
Uh-oh!

837
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,640
THEY LAUGH

838
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,240
That's just brilliant.

839
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,840
That is an elk.

840
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,520
A cow elk. So, this is something that always happens.

841
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,280
You set up your camera trap, you think you've got the right angle,

842
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,280
and then one of the animals comes along and wants to change the angle.

843
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,800
- Oh, man!
- It's giving it a good go. 
- She's kicking it.

844
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,160
I think it shows their playfulness.

845
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,960
They come over to something new, curious, and it's like...

846
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,040
"I think I'm going to play a little soccer with it."

847
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,840
That's just great.

848
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,520
Let's have a look at a couple of the other clips.

849
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,360
Whoa, first clip!

850
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,560
- Exactly what we wanted.
- Wow.

851
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,000
That's a big male.

852
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,640
I guess it's what we would expect,

853
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,880
this time of the year,

854
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,840
that these big guys will be the first ones coming out of the den.

855
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,720
The females and the cubs are still up high.

856
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,320
Casey, Casey, this is a huge bear.

857
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,600
Remember when we set this camera trap,

858
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,520
- we were anticipating that we would get the whole bear, but...
- Mm-hm.

859
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,760
- Just missing the head. 
- He's bigger than that.

860
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,920
He stands at 2.5 metres tall.

861
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,080
He's giving it a real bear hug!

862
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,160
That's a bear hug, for sure.

863
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,600
Wow. And there we go,

864
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,400
doing that kind of cowboy walk you were talking about, right?

865
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,520
Really trying to grind in his scent,

866
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,880
leave those marks.

867
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,600
That cowboy walk.

868
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,720
That means one thing - "I'm in town and I'm the boss."

869
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,640
But what are they picking up,

870
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,200
and how do you think that affects their behaviour?

871
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,600
Well, as they emerge, it's the beginning of the mating season,

872
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,720
so it's important for males to know if there is a bigger male around.

873
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,280
- It's like... 
- HE SNIFFS

874
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,720
"Oh, this big dude's here,

875
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,160
"maybe I don't want to be here," and they'll go the other way.

876
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,400
Equally for the females, they want to know, you know,

877
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,720
who is going to be the father of their next offspring.

878
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,200
- Yeah.
- If there's any big tough guys around.

879
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,440
Although the unusual weather a few weeks ago

880
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,640
had brought some of them out of hibernation early,

881
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,800
these males appear fighting fit.

882
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,080
Spring is in the air, and the bears are getting frisky.

883
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,160
But they're not the only males getting boisterous.

884
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,880
These elk are shedding their antlers.

885
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,720
New ones will regrow over the next few months,

886
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,040
ready for the autumn rutting season.

887
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,920
But perhaps the biggest male show-offs are down in the south,

888
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,560
and Kate has a front-row seat for their fabulous performance.

889
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,640
WITTERING

890
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,880
It's mating season for the sage grouse.

891
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,920
They really like to make a proper song and dance about it.

892
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,680
GROUSE WITTERS

893
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,480
That sound... It's really difficult to describe.

894
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,240
It's like a sort of...

895
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,640
popping and a drumming.

896
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,840
It's that, combined with these wonderful, very showy

897
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,280
puffed-up white chests,

898
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,120
and those fanned-out black tail feathers,

899
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,920
that will attract the females.

900
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,880
Ooh, there's one.

901
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,840
And they will literally do a fly past -

902
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,480
they'll sort of fly over and look down

903
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,760
and say, "Oh, yeah, I don't mind the look of that one,

904
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,720
"I'll give that one a go."

905
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,640
Greater Yellowstone is a stronghold for the sage grouse,

906
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,800
a species under threat.

907
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,000
Once numbering tens of millions,

908
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,960
there are now just a few hundred thousand of these birds left.

909
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,320
Many of them rely on Yellowstone,

910
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,000
where there is still plenty of their habitat - sage brush.

911
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,640
It is now around 11 degrees,

912
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,240
perfect for breeding.

913
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,360
But success will depend on how the thaw progresses.

914
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,520
Chicks won't do well if the temperatures soar too quickly.

915
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,640
So far during the thaw, some of our animals have done well,

916
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,040
and some haven't.

917
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,240
The jumping around in temperature

918
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,760
at the end of winter confused some bears

919
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,200
and made life difficult for the owls.

920
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,080
One of the mildest winters on record and a lack of snow

921
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,560
prevented the wolves hunting successfully,

922
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,640
yet the elk and bison emerged from the season in high numbers,

923
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,880
and with plenty of fighting spirit.

924
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,120
Soon this landscape will be transformed

925
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,680
from brown and barren to lush and green,

926
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,000
but the arrival of spring doesn't necessarily mean

927
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,400
that life will get easier for our animal families.

928
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,960
All those newborn youngsters

929
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,880
will mean that there's lots of competition for food,

930
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,360
and the predators will be ever present,

931
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,920
on the lookout for the young and the vulnerable.

932
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,640
Tomorrow night,

933
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,600
will the grizzly bear cubs find enough food to eat

934
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,560
when they venture out into the big, wide world?

935
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,520
We join a beaver family,

936
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,120
but will they deal with the deluge?

937
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,800
The water level is so much higher.

938
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,520
After a difficult winter for the wolves,

939
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,000
will their luck turn?

940
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,560
And there is a nest of great grey owl chicks,

941
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,600
but will they all survive?

942
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,080
Oh, he is struggling.
