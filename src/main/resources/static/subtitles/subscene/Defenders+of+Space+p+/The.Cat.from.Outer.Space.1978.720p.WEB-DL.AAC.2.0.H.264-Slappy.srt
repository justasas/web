1
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:18,271
What is it?
What is that light?

2
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,472
I don't know.

3
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:29,811
You stay right here, Edna.

4
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:31,746
Don't leave the house.

5
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:35,082
I'm gonna take a look at it.

6
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:36,383
Come on, Dutch.

7
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:42,153
Chicken.

8
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:15,852
Holy mackerel!

9
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:28,164
<i>This is earth probe Zunar
J5 calling mother ship.</i>

10
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,167
<i>Zunar J5 calling mother ship.</i>

11
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:33,536
<i>Come in, mother ship.</i>

12
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:37,907
<i>This is earth probe Zunar J5
calling mother ship.</i>

13
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,776
<i>Zunar j5, this is mother ship.</i>

14
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:42,878
<i>Have you completed emergency landing?</i>

15
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,312
<i>Affirmative, mother.</i>

16
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:46,547
<i>Request repair party.</i>

17
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,782
<i>Negative, Zunar J5.</i>

18
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:51,351
<i>You'll have to effect
emergency repairs yourself.</i>

19
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:55,588
<i>And rendezvous with us at grid dissect 8304.</i>

20
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,591
<i>At 69 hours minus 17.</i>

21
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,659
<i>That's an awfully tight squeeze, mother.</i>

22
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:02,227
<i>Unavoidable, Zunar.</i>

23
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:06,364
<i>Next mission to this galaxy due in 115.</i>

24
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,199
<i>- Days?
- Years.</i>

25
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,534
<i>Good luck, Zunar J5.</i>

26
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:12,352
<i>Over and out.</i>

27
00:03:12,353 --> 00:03:14,169
<i>Yeah.
So long, mother.</i>

28
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:23,502
I don't see any hammer and sickle.
Do you, Colonel?

29
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:25,971
Maybe it's on the inside, General.

30
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,943
No sign of life, either.

31
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:34,978
Get me the Pentagon, red priority.

32
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
I wanna speak to the chiefs, Colonel.

33
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,514
Captain?
Sergeant.

34
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:39,982
Yes, sir.

35
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:41,850
Sequoia here.
Come in, Rover.

36
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:43,884
Rover?

37
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,651
Rover?

38
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:55,894
Rover?

39
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,862
Rover?

40
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,437
Wipe it out of your minds. You understand?

41
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,005
You've seen nothing and heard nothing.

42
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,290
Yes, sir.

43
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,574
We'll want them later for debriefing.

44
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:12,808
Take their names.

45
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,309
Colonel?

46
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,977
Captain.

47
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,411
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:20,979
Names, please?

49
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:21,946
Name's Charlie Cooney.

50
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:23,914
General Stilton!

51
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,815
We're ready when you are, sir.

52
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,817
Bullhorn.
Yes, sir.

53
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:31,687
<i>On to Hopscotch.</i>

54
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:34,823
All right, men.
Let's move it!

55
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:06,387
Let's move out.
Colonel.

56
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:07,955
Captain.

57
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,389
Sergeant.

58
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:10,723
Yes, sir.

59
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,608
When we get to Hopscotch,

60
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,977
I want mark-four
priority security.

61
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,346
Armor, personnel, guard dogs, the works.

62
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,748
And not one word to public relations.

63
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,300
Not one word.

64
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:41,851
- You got that, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

65
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,586
- You got that, captain?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:44,820
- Sergeant?
- Got it.

67
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,707
Well?

68
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,109
It's a brilliant technological
achievement, General.

69
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,678
There's absolutely nothing like
it in the state of the art.

70
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,881
You trying to tell me something, Allison?

71
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:17,016
It's definitely not one of ours, General.

72
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:18,617
How about Russia?

73
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,784
Certainly not Russia.

74
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:21,485
It's far beyond the capabilities of...

75
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:23,787
Okay, Allison.
Lay it on the line.

76
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:24,921
Whose is it?

77
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:27,956
I don't know, General.

78
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,391
Well, we better find out.

79
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:31,892
I wanna know who made that thing,

80
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:33,860
Who flew it and where it came from.

81
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,027
Colonel?
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:37,029
Contact Sigcomm on our radio.

83
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:38,630
Get Hungerford at air.

84
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:40,565
Call Steinmetz at Johns Hopkins,

85
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,567
Lasser, Billings, Cranhammer.

86
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,602
Get them iqs off their tennis courts.

87
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:46,670
Yes, sir.
Double pronto!

88
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:49,072
Because if we don't find out
where that thing came from,

89
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:51,674
This country could be in trouble,

90
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:53,042
Big, big trouble.

91
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:55,109
Colonel.

92
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:56,176
Captain.

93
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:57,777
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.

94
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,985
You say it's not
man-made, Allison.

95
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,820
What's that leave us?

96
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:12,888
Outer space.

97
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,991
With no sign of the pilot.

98
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:19,794
Big, big trouble.

99
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:22,763
While you and I are talking
this very minute,

100
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:25,866
Some slimy green-headed, 12-legged creep.

101
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:28,535
Could be crawling into the White House.

102
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:30,570
Big, big trouble.

103
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:33,939
We're up against genius.

104
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:38,543
We'd better come up
with some genius of our own.

105
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,116
I believe, General, you've already met.

106
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:50,653
My administrative
assistant, Dr. Corday.

107
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,222
And I'd like to introduce some of
the other members of our team.

108
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:57,059
Dr. Robeson of Caltech, who's
our expert on fossil fuel.

109
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:00,595
Professor Hurakawa of Johns Hopkins.

110
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:02,697
Dr. Elizabeth Bartlett,
who heads thermal.

111
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,232
Dr. Norman Link, who's been
doing some intriguing work.

112
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,834
In garbage research.

113
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:10,535
- So what?
- Dr. Link.

114
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:13,004
Just a second,
Dr. Heffel.

115
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:16,874
I have to relay some vital
information to a colleague.

116
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,576
Yes. This is our hard-water man, Dr. Leach.

117
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:22,745
Right, Ernie. The Lakers by a
point and a half for 100 bucks.

118
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:25,948
When will you have the line on
Philly and the New York Knicks?

119
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,950
I'd like you
to meet Mr. Jurist,

120
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:30,118
Who also is involved in thermal.

121
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,080
And of course I'm sure
you're familiar with our...

122
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:40,994
And there's Dr. Banford,
Professor Epstein,

123
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,962
Doctors Davidson and Barrett,

124
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,245
And, of course, this is Dr.
Humphrey, our head of nuclear.

125
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,900
Mr. Stallwood, our head of
procurement and supplies.

126
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:50,869
Stallwood, what are you doing here?

127
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:52,670
Well, sir, when the call went out.

128
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:54,772
For an emergency meeting,
I naturally assumed...

129
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:56,724
You assumed wrong.

130
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,675
Scientists.
Double-A clearance only. Out.

131
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:01,277
But Dr. Heffel, I might have
a contribution to make...

132
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
If we need any sharp
pencils, I'll send for you.

133
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:04,946
But, Dr. Heffel...
Out.

134
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,116
Sorry, General.

135
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,217
Where was I?

136
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,885
Yes. Professor...

137
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:14,721
Dr. Heffel, I didn't
come here for a roll call,

138
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:16,255
I came to pick some brains.

139
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,823
Are they all here?

140
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,658
Yes. I'd say these
are our top people.

141
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,593
Then let's get to it!

142
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:24,529
I understand, General.
Attention, everyone.

143
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,898
Dr. Link.

144
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,601
Well, that's it, Professor. I'll
call tomorrow with more input. Bye.

145
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:31,902
All right, sergeant, open it.

146
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:34,170
Drapes.

147
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:51,252
Ladies and gentlemen, what you
are about to see is top secret.

148
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:54,988
The united states government
will countenance no leaks.

149
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:56,889
Now...

150
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,108
What's holding it up?

151
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:23,180
Nothing.
It's amazing.

152
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,381
Where did you get it?

153
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,216
What is it?

154
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,318
A propulsion unit of some
sort, ladies and gentlemen.

155
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:32,087
Never mind where we got it.

156
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,323
We have other experts working on that.

157
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:37,925
What we want to know from you is,

158
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:41,961
What makes it tick?

159
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:44,162
Okay, let's have your hypothesis.

160
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,065
The energy source could be atomic.

161
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,366
We've checked on that.
Negative.

162
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,004
Direct conversion, utilizing thermionic...

163
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,839
Checked out. Negative.

164
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:05,945
It's not propelled by garbage, I know that.

165
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:25,763
Jellyfish calling Olympus.

166
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,331
Jellyfish calling Olympus.

167
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,232
Come in, Olympus.

168
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:33,935
I'll call you about it later.

169
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,204
Mr. Olympus?

170
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,805
This is Jellyfish.

171
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:42,008
I think I'm on to
something very big and very...

172
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,209
Jellyfish.

173
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:46,145
Your man in ERL?

174
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:48,046
Yes, sir. That Jellyfish.

175
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:50,915
I think I'm on to something.

176
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:52,816
No, sir. I think you'll
find this a great deal.

177
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:55,485
More interesting than my last report.

178
00:12:55,487 --> 00:13:00,089
Right now, Dr. Heffel
is in a secret meeting.

179
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:04,426
With a four-star General and a
whole gaggle of scientists.

180
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:05,994
What are they meeting about?

181
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,429
Well, I don't know, sir.
It's a secret.

182
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:11,932
Get in there and find out?

183
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,401
Do any of you have a solid evaluation?

184
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:15,835
Not a guess,

185
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,903
A solid premise?

186
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:19,337
Do you?

187
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,038
Well?

188
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:26,375
Do you think it might be fruitful.

189
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:30,078
To bring Dr. Wilson into this
discussion, Dr. Heffel?

190
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,813
Wilson?

191
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:34,949
Yes. He might very well come
up with an applicable theory.

192
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,784
Don't be ridiculous.

193
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:39,986
Who's Dr. Wilson?

194
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:42,054
He's in my carpool.

195
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:45,557
That is, we live in the same building.

196
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,025
That certainly qualifies him.

197
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,096
No, what I'm trying to say is,

198
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:55,132
He's a very bright, young physicist.

199
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,068
Who's come here recently
on loan from Caltech.

200
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,237
A loan, I might add, that is
bearing absolutely no interest.

201
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,309
He's a little unorthodox,
but a brilliant theorist.

202
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,177
Dr. Bartlett, General Stilton
isn't interested in...

203
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,179
Get him.
What?

204
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:16,016
Get him. His output couldn't be any
less than what we've gotten so far.

205
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:17,049
Yes, General.

206
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:23,488
He really has an unusual mind.

207
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:34,198
Well, Dr. Wilson?

208
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,332
It's beautiful.

209
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:39,102
Don't you have any other observation?

210
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:40,970
Only that it looks like an artichoke, sir.

211
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:42,972
We know it looks like an artichoke, Wilson.

212
00:14:42,974 --> 00:14:44,974
What makes it tick?

213
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,108
Mayonnaise?

214
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:49,476
Negative.

215
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,112
No, no, I was only joking, sir.

216
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:55,114
I do have a theory, sir,

217
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:57,115
Actually in line with
the work I've been doing.

218
00:14:57,118 --> 00:15:00,018
I have a hunch it's tapping the
primal mainstream, General.

219
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,053
The "primal mainstream"?

220
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:04,055
The primal mainstream, yes,
it's everywhere, General,

221
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:05,189
Only on different frequencies.

222
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:07,457
The whole
electro-magnetic spectrum.

223
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,091
Cosmic, gamma,

224
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:12,094
X-rays, ultraviolet,
visible light,

225
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,029
Infrared, radio waves...
And do you know.

226
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:16,965
How much we finite human
beings can probably tune into?

227
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,132
With our senses?

228
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,267
Less than five percent.

229
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,636
The universe makes its own energy, General.

230
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,004
We even make it ourselves.

231
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,072
Yes, take biofeedback, for instance.

232
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:29,241
Why, if I taped terminals
to your head, General,

233
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:31,876
Your brain could run an electric train.

234
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,944
Electric train?

235
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,879
I'm sorry, General, I thought...

236
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,447
Perhaps electric train
wasn't the most apt...

237
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:39,916
That'll be all, Wilson.
Thank you very much.

238
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:41,918
You let me have that for a
couple of months, General.

239
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,419
And I promise you...
Thank you.

240
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:47,089
A couple of months?

241
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,557
Dr. Heffel?
Yes, General?

242
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,191
I want action.

243
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:04,069
You know, Drexel,

244
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,304
I've seen the most amazing thing.

245
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:08,005
Amazing.

246
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,640
But don't ask me to tell you about it.
It's classified.

247
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,088
Thank you, Drexel.

248
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,536
Well. How did you
get in here?

249
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:52,939
Now, look, you're asking for trouble.

250
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:56,609
Dr. Heffel isn't too crazy
about animals in the building.

251
00:16:56,611 --> 00:17:00,079
Fact is, he isn't too crazy about
people in the building either.

252
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,081
What's your name?

253
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:04,382
Charlie? Cuddles?

254
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:07,283
Jake? Yes, yes.
You look like Jake.

255
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,719
That, Jake,

256
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:14,188
Is the Van Allen Belt.

257
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,308
Oil and coal is not
going to do it, you know.

258
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:20,429
And one of these days, that sun of ours
is going to turn into a big black hole.

259
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,532
You know where it's really at, Jake?

260
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:29,234
Electromagnetism.
We're loaded with it.

261
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:33,437
You know, it's crazy,
but you almost look like.

262
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,038
You know what I'm talking about.

263
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,319
All right, give me a hand
with this, Sergeant.

264
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,688
Easy, easy.
That's it.

265
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:10,770
Stallwood, administration emergency!

266
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:21,313
Hey, that's some fancy collar you got there.

267
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:23,014
Maybe I'll take you home with me.

268
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:25,316
My neighbor, Liz, has a cat named Lucybelle.

269
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:27,084
She's really cute.

270
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,246
And the cat's not bad either.

271
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:33,388
Liz! Hi... Ouch!

272
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,557
I've... We were just
talking about you.

273
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,791
Were you?

274
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:40,326
This is Jake.

275
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,394
I'm going to take him home with us.

276
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:45,530
You won't have to drive Professor Link
and myself home tonight, Dr. Wilson.

277
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:47,064
Heffel's called a late meeting.

278
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,765
I don't mind waiting.

279
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,433
That won't be necessary. We've
made other arrangements.

280
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:51,767
How... How about a cup of coffee? No.

281
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,435
Chocolate chip cookie?

282
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:54,736
No!

283
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:56,070
Hey, are you sore or something?

284
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:58,272
Sore? Sore?

285
00:18:58,274 --> 00:19:00,407
Well, whatever gave you that idea?

286
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:02,108
What is it?
What did I do?

287
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,211
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

288
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:07,046
Mayonnaise?

289
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,348
Electric trains?

290
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,383
Well, now, look, really, all that...

291
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,284
That was just a joke, doctor.

292
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,520
Well, nobody laughed.

293
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,922
Especially the General.

294
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,490
Has he had water?

295
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,391
The General?
The cat.

296
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:23,892
Water?

297
00:19:23,894 --> 00:19:25,860
Cats do get thirsty, you know.

298
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,729
Do you have a bowl?...A bowl.

299
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:30,630
Right here.
Yes. Here.

300
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:33,365
Here.
Water?

301
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,367
Yes, right, water.

302
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:36,835
Look, Liz...

303
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,770
Dr. Bartlett.

304
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,872
Just because some General.

305
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:43,407
Lacks a sense of humor,
now that's no reason...

306
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,375
Well, anyway, all I was trying to convey...

307
00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:47,477
I'm really not interested, doctor.

308
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,578
Well, besides, I wasn't trying to be funny.
It's just that.

309
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:51,948
The magnitude of what the General
showed us this afternoon.

310
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,783
Just bowled me over.

311
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:57,486
It did?
Completely.

312
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:00,188
Black.

313
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,956
What? Didn't you offer me a cup of coffee?

314
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,591
Right. Check.
Coming right up.

315
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:07,226
I just... I really don't
understand, that's all.

316
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:09,528
The man who wrote the article you did.

317
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,730
For <i>The Scientific Quarterly,</i> July 12th...

318
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,331
You read it?

319
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,232
Well, of course.
It was brilliant.

320
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:17,200
There's something I've
been wanting to tell you.

321
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:18,868
We don't get much chance
to talk in the carpool,

322
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,937
But I've been following
your work in thermal.

323
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:24,372
You have?
Closely.

324
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:26,974
It's very impressive, very innovative.

325
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,844
Very attractive. I mean, it's
bound to attract attention.

326
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,645
Well...

327
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:35,280
I am writing an article at the moment.

328
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,548
And I would love to have your criticism.

329
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,851
Maybe at lunch or, even
better, at dinner sometime?

330
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:43,553
Yeah, I'd like that.

331
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:45,354
When?
Tonight?

332
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,789
No, that's right, you've
got that late meeting.

333
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:52,393
Well, that may not go all that late.
I should be out by 7:00.

334
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,894
Is that too late?
7:00 is beautiful.

335
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:55,462
Good.

336
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:57,597
Well...

337
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,366
Thanks for the coffee. It was delicious.

338
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:10,872
<i>I think she digs you.</i>

339
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,673
I sure hope so.

340
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,926
Who said that?
<i>I did.</i>

341
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:19,911
<i>And, Frank, we'd better get down to business.
Sit down. We've gotta talk.</i>

342
00:21:19,914 --> 00:21:21,880
<i>I'm running out of time, and it
looks like you're the only one</i>

343
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,282
<i>I can depend on to help me.</i>

344
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,353
It... It's you?
<i>It's not the mouse.</i>

345
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,355
<i>Now, sit down.</i>

346
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,891
But your lips aren't moving.
You're not speaking.

347
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:40,395
<i>Thought transference. Nothing exceptional
where I come from. Now, sit.</i>

348
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:48,001
<i>My name is
Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7.</i>

349
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:49,452
Zunar...

350
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:51,013
<i>Why don't we just stay with Jake, okay?</i>

351
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:55,641
<i>Frank, last night, at 03 hours plus 13,</i>

352
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:59,044
<i>I made an emergency landing in a
spaceship from another galaxy.</i>

353
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:02,847
<i>That so-called artichoke,
it's from my craft.</i>

354
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:05,816
But... You're a cat.

355
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:08,585
<i>Granted. But you see,
Frank, in our civilization,</i>

356
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:10,720
<i>That's as far as we needed to evolve.</i>

357
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:13,322
<i>We developed our brain to a fine point.</i>

358
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:15,691
<i>Now, man, on the other hand,
rose off his four legs.</i>

359
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:18,527
<i>And developed tools, machinery, agriculture,</i>

360
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:21,830
<i>And a chronic pain in his lower back.</i>

361
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,932
<i>We developed tools for the mind.</i>

362
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:26,901
<i>This collar here, it amplifies brain power.</i>

363
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,702
It... It does what?

364
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:30,837
<i>Well, it provides energy by which we...</i>

365
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,072
<i>Look, let me give you a demonstration.</i>

366
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:01,430
<i>Not a bad little tune.</i>

367
00:23:19,713 --> 00:23:21,679
<i>Frank, this is really delicious. What is it?</i>

368
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:24,948
It's chopped kidney.

369
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,950
It's all they had at the deli.

370
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:28,952
<i>It really hits the spot.</i>

371
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:30,953
<i>I'm gonna take a couple of
cases for my trip back.</i>

372
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,956
<i>Sure beats the blah I've been eating.</i>

373
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,825
<i>Well, now back to my problem.</i>

374
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:41,995
<i>Frank, I need an answer.
What do you say?</i>

375
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:44,197
Say about what?

376
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:46,398
<i>Can I count on you to help
me repair my spaceship?</i>

377
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:48,833
Why me?

378
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:50,568
<i>Because I like the way you think.</i>

379
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,870
<i>Your equations rather interest me.</i>

380
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:55,038
<i>In fact, they're really not bad at all.
For a human.</i>

381
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:58,974
Really? I'm on
the right track?

382
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,508
<i>Quite definitely.</i>

383
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,877
<i>But years away from a solution.</i>

384
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,846
<i>Frank, on my planet, we have an expression.</i>

385
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:08,982
<i>"you rub my fur,
I'll rub yours."</i>

386
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:11,718
<i>How would you like to make a quantum jump?</i>

387
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,588
<i>You help me, and I'll give you
a push in the right direction.</i>

388
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,892
You're serious?
<i>I'm serious.</i>

389
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:21,693
You're telling me the truth? <i>The truth.</i>

390
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,061
You really are from outer space?
<i>I am from outer space.</i>

391
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:24,429
Even though you're a cat?

392
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:25,963
<i>Frank! Is it a deal?</i>

393
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,167
It's a deal.
That's...

394
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,135
<i>We better get moving.
I've got to make repairs.</i>

395
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,537
<i>To my ship by 5:13
Sunday for liftoff,</i>

396
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:36,971
<i>Or I'll miss the rendezvous
with the mother ship.</i>

397
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:39,506
Right...
I'll get my sweater.

398
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:43,810
Do you think that you can find
your way back to that airport?

399
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:45,611
<i>No problem. I made
a memory imprint.</i>

400
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:48,480
With the collar?
<i>Right.</i>

401
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,782
Fantastic.

402
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:57,853
How developed does your brain
have to be to use that collar?

403
00:24:57,855 --> 00:24:59,955
<i>Not very. In fact,
you could handle it.</i>

404
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:03,491
<i>You wanna try?</i>

405
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:06,893
Well... Do we have time?

406
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:10,162
<i>Why not? Look, just...
Just grab hold of it.</i>

407
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:12,697
<i>Easy! Don't take it off.
I mean, without that collar,</i>

408
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:13,864
<i>I'm just an average cat.</i>

409
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:14,865
Right, right.

410
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,900
<i>Right. Okay?</i>

411
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:17,902
Okay.

412
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:20,636
<i>Now just concentrate.</i>

413
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:22,137
Concentrate.

414
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,005
<i>Think levitation.</i>

415
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:27,675
Levitation.

416
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,876
<i>You're as light as a feather.</i>

417
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:39,885
Look at me.
I'm floating!

418
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,523
It's just plain incredible!

419
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:51,546
Hey, look, one hand.

420
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:53,197
<i>Watch it, Frank! You're
losing your concentration.</i>

421
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,631
Yeah.

422
00:26:01,872 --> 00:26:04,772
Hi, Frank.
Gotta use your set.

423
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,592
<i>The ball goes crosscourt to Brown.</i>

424
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,243
<i>He brings it up into the front court...</i>

425
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:12,078
What were you doing up in the air?

426
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,814
Astronaut exercises.

427
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,216
Link, I'm busy.

428
00:26:17,218 --> 00:26:20,085
Yeah. Well, just
forget I'm here.

429
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:22,487
It's the last minute of the game,

430
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,889
And Francine throws me out of the apartment.

431
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:26,490
Why does she throw me out of the apartment?

432
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:28,825
For one lousy cigar burn on the chair.

433
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:31,794
When did you get a cat?

434
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:33,862
Jake's not my cat.
He's just visiting.

435
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:35,697
Hi, Jake.

436
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:36,898
Link, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

437
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,599
Do you mind, Frank?

438
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:40,201
<i>Okay, I am back in.</i>

439
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,802
<i>Remember, the score's tied at 108.</i>

440
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:44,538
<i>Atlanta has the ball
and a basket could win it.</i>

441
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,172
Win it? Man!

442
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:47,573
And I gave a point and a half.

443
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:49,708
Well, there goes my 100 bucks.

444
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,210
Come on, defense. Come on, guys.
Man to man, we'll...

445
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:54,679
<i>The crowd is really on its feet now.</i>

446
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,616
<i>He's alone in the baseline
and closely guarded by king.</i>

447
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,286
<i>King steals the ball.
What a play!</i>

448
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,022
<i>Here come the lakers to the attack.
Five seconds left.</i>

449
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:08,358
<i>Pete Burt puts up a shot. But
a prayer, there's no chance.</i>

450
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,026
<i>Wait...</i>

451
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:12,260
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

452
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,229
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

453
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,934
<i>I don't believe it.
He scores!</i>

454
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:24,970
<i>He made it in the last second, and
the Lakers will win it by two.</i>

455
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:27,706
Unbelievable!
Frank, did you see that?

456
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,210
Yeah.

457
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:35,213
Yeah. Link, I'm really gonna
have to ask you to leave.

458
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:36,914
Yeah, I could use another beer, Frank.

459
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,181
Yeah, I'm out of beer, I'm sorry.

460
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:40,650
Okay. How
about a ginger ale?

461
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,218
I'm out of that, too.

462
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,919
Could I at least finish my cigar?
Link, please.

463
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:45,654
Frank, I'd like to have
a little celebration.

464
00:27:45,656 --> 00:27:47,055
I haven't won a bet in two weeks!

465
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:48,856
I'll see you later.

466
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,126
The basketball game?

467
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,140
You did that?

468
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,086
<i>Frank, any friend of yours
is a friend of mine.</i>

469
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:00,032
<i>Besides, it seemed the fastest
way to get rid of that flake.</i>

470
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:02,200
<i>Now, let's go. I've got less
than 36 hours to liftoff.</i>

471
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:04,068
Right...

472
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,903
Do you think I ought to carry you?

473
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:08,972
I mean, just so people don't suspect
you're not an ordinary cat?

474
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:12,407
<i>Good thinking, Frank. Besides, my
left paw's been acting up again.</i>

475
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:15,910
An old football injury?

476
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:17,978
<i>Actually, no. Polo.</i>

477
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,412
<i>Now let's go.</i>
You...

478
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:22,848
What about getting into Hopscotch?

479
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,915
It's got to be heavily guarded.

480
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,783
<i>I'll handle that, too.</i>

481
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,985
It's fantastic.

482
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:30,454
Hi. Hi, this is Lucybelle.

483
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:32,055
What'd you say you call him?

484
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:33,990
- Jake.
- Jake, right.

485
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:36,058
Jake, this is Lucybelle.

486
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,341
I thought they could get
acquainted while we're at dinner.

487
00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:40,227
At dinner?

488
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:42,996
Yeah. It was
tonight, wasn't it?

489
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:43,998
Right...

490
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,733
Right. Right, yes.

491
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:49,435
And... I was just
about to call you.

492
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,370
Something came up.

493
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:53,731
And I'm afraid you're going to
have to give me a rain check.

494
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:57,775
Well, of course.
It really doesn't matter.

495
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,178
But it does. It matters a lot, Liz.
Dr. Bartlett.

496
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,181
You see, what happened was...

497
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:14,388
It's Jake. He took sick.
Suddenly. Out of the blue.

498
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,089
Really? What is it?

499
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:19,958
I think it's...
Tasmanian croup.

500
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,131
You poor thing. You know,
he sounds terrible.

501
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,366
Yeah. You'd better not
let her get too close.

502
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,734
Stop milking it.

503
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,035
What?

504
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,903
I said I was about to rush him to the vet's.

505
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:38,039
The vet. That's a good idea, Frank.

506
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,007
Hey, do you know there's a very good vet.

507
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:42,909
Who lives right in the building?
A Dr. Wenger.

508
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:46,145
He specializes in cats. I'm sure
he'd be glad to take a look at him.

509
00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:47,846
Yeah, well, Jake prefers.

510
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:49,280
A General practitioner.

511
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:52,049
Look, I'm sorry about dinner, Liz.
I'll make it up to you.

512
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:55,218
How about a picnic?
I'd love it! Tomorrow?

513
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,888
<i>You handled that situation very well, Frank.</i>

514
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,422
I didn't enjoy lying to Liz.

515
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,190
She's a very unusual person.

516
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,959
<i>Her kitty-cat's
not too bad either.</i>

517
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,241
There's plenty of time for that.

518
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,345
<i>That's all right for you to say.</i>

519
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:11,466
<i>But I've been confined to
a spaceship for five months.</i>

520
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,089
<i>The ship's in that big hangar.</i>

521
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:55,501
There's got to be a way in.

522
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:06,443
It's locked.
<i>No problem.</i>

523
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,415
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

524
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:15,949
Right, right.

525
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:41,607
<i>The coast is clear.
Let's go!</i>

526
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:56,520
<i>There she is.</i>

527
00:31:59,157 --> 00:32:02,024
<i>Somebody's coming.</i>

528
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:03,458
<i>Somebody's coming, Frank!</i>

529
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,926
I know, I know.

530
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:15,501
<i>What's happening?</i>

531
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,069
It's all clear.

532
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:21,071
<i>Let's go!</i>

533
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
It's this way.

534
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,464
<i>Forget it. Forget it.
It wears off in 20 minutes.</i>

535
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:55,098
<i>It's harmless.
He won't remember a thing.</i>

536
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,033
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

537
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:55,674
Incredible.

538
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,258
<i>An older model, but in pretty good shape.</i>

539
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,727
<i>For a rig with nearly
a trillion miles on it.</i>

540
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:03,397
<i>Well, now let's see what we can do
about getting it operational again.</i>

541
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,399
<i>We've only got 34 hours left.</i>

542
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:08,034
Right. Through here?

543
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:10,069
<i>Put me down.</i>

544
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:17,042
It's just incredible.

545
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:21,980
The artichoke.
I was right.

546
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:23,514
What's this?
Control panel?

547
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:25,215
<i>Sort of.</i>

548
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:26,649
And this?

549
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:28,183
<i>Computer.</i>

550
00:34:28,185 --> 00:34:30,018
Then this must be the readout?

551
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,703
<i>Frank, later.</i>

552
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:33,387
<i>I'll explain it all later, I promise.</i>

553
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,094
<i>First, we have to disengage
the transducer system.</i>

554
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:41,896
But how?

555
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:43,697
<i>Take that neo-mag
neutralizing intercog,</i>

556
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:46,199
<i>And you'll find the transducer
switch on top of the ship.</i>

557
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:48,234
<i>Just coordinate with me.</i>

558
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:52,337
Well, how do I get up there?

559
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,272
<i>Fly.</i>
Fly?

560
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:55,640
You mean use your collar?

561
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:57,775
<i>Don't be ridiculous.
We carry a spare.</i>

562
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:02,212
<i>Just concentrate, and when you get on top,</i>

563
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:04,013
<i>Engage the switch with the intercog.</i>

564
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,715
<i>And thought-project
"seven max triad."</i>

565
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:08,349
Seven max triad.

566
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:10,050
<i>Right. The computer
will do the rest.</i>

567
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:12,552
Seven max triad. Right.

568
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:39,243
Hey!

569
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:19,111
<i>Hey, Frank, what are you doing up there?
What about the intercog?</i>

570
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,513
<i>Frank?</i>

571
00:36:25,117 --> 00:36:27,851
Jake, I'm ready to plug it in.

572
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,219
<i>Right. Go ahead.</i>

573
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,191
It's in.

574
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,825
<i>Okay. Thought-project.</i>

575
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,963
Seven max triad.

576
00:36:58,413 --> 00:36:59,945
<i>Okay, Frank.
Come on down.</i>

577
00:37:03,984 --> 00:37:05,550
Amazing.

578
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:28,055
<i>I was afraid of that.</i>

579
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:29,806
<i>The focal terminal on the
microtransformer's vaporized.</i>

580
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:31,240
<i>It happens in these older models.</i>

581
00:37:31,242 --> 00:37:32,674
You're sure?
<i>Positive.</i>

582
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:33,907
<i>But I'll double-check.</i>

583
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:39,612
<i>Just what I thought.</i>

584
00:37:39,614 --> 00:37:41,614
That's where the focal terminal goes?
In that little thing?

585
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:44,950
<i>Acts as a catalyzer. I'll need
a small amount of org 12.</i>

586
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:47,808
What's org 12?

587
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,631
<i>What the focal terminal's made of.</i>

588
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:51,454
<i>About six cubits ought to be
enough for emergency repair.</i>

589
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,890
<i>You don't have org 12 on this planet?</i>

590
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:56,293
Never heard of it.
Is it like mayonnaise?

591
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,674
<i>You probably call it by a different name.</i>

592
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:02,915
<i>Now, stand back, Frank. I'll
run it through the computer.</i>

593
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:17,979
Hey, Tom!
You all right?

594
00:38:19,282 --> 00:38:20,414
Tom!

595
00:38:22,785 --> 00:38:27,454
<i>Org 12. Ductile yellow metallic element.</i>

596
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:30,857
<i>Melting point, 1,063.</i>

597
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:33,726
<i>Tensile strength, 19,000.</i>

598
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,927
Tensile strength what?

599
00:38:34,929 --> 00:38:36,461
<i>19,000.</i>

600
00:38:36,463 --> 00:38:41,999
<i>Atomic weight, 196.967.</i>

601
00:38:43,435 --> 00:38:45,435
Wait a minute.

602
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:47,703
That's the atomic weight of gold!

603
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:53,040
Wow!

604
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:03,481
Out! Out!
Everybody out!

605
00:39:04,617 --> 00:39:05,949
<i>What is that?</i>

606
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:08,850
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

607
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:13,654
Follow me!

608
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:21,860
Holy cow.

609
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,094
<i>Give my collar room, Frank.</i>

610
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:24,929
You can't zap the whole base.

611
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:26,864
Let's get out of here.

612
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:30,968
Over here! Follow me! Move out!

613
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,718
Watch it!

614
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,557
Hey!

615
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:58,492
Come back here!

616
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:03,029
<i>Where are you going?</i>

617
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:05,464
Hey, hey! Come out of there.
You're under arrest!

618
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:06,798
Look out!

619
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:26,849
What is it?

620
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,652
Get it off of me!
Get it off!

621
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,756
Was anybody in there?

622
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:39,024
Back it out. Back it out.
Look out. Who's driving?

623
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:44,596
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!

624
00:40:44,598 --> 00:40:45,897
Yes, sir?

625
00:40:45,899 --> 00:40:47,531
What's going on here?
Who sounded that alarm?

626
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:50,934
I did, sir. We have an
intruder, and his cat.

627
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:52,969
Cat? Cat? Cat?

628
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:54,971
Yes, sir.
Here's his collar.

629
00:40:55,773 --> 00:40:56,938
Jake!

630
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:00,707
<i>Excuse me.</i>

631
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:05,645
Jake, are you all right?

632
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:07,446
<i>Frank, shut up and move this thing.</i>

633
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:10,114
That's him, sir!

634
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:11,682
Halt!

635
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:16,486
Get that thing out of here! Get it out!

636
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:17,953
Move it out!

637
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:42,642
Now what do we do?

638
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:43,843
<i>Now you hang on.</i>

639
00:42:05,465 --> 00:42:07,898
17 times...

640
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,966
Five of...

641
00:42:11,636 --> 00:42:13,936
Now cosine of...

642
00:42:13,938 --> 00:42:16,004
Yeah...

643
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:22,510
<i>Hey, Frank. This is even better
than the stuff I had last night.</i>

644
00:42:22,512 --> 00:42:23,644
<i>What's it called?</i>

645
00:42:23,646 --> 00:42:25,212
Tuna.

646
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:26,980
<i>Tuna? Love it.</i>

647
00:42:29,951 --> 00:42:32,051
Keeps coming out the same way
and it doesn't make any sense.

648
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:33,519
<i>What doesn't?</i>

649
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:34,720
Well, according to your figures,

650
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:37,155
We're going to need $120,000 worth of gold.

651
00:42:37,157 --> 00:42:38,523
<i>So?</i>

652
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:39,991
So?

653
00:42:39,993 --> 00:42:42,893
Jake, forgetting the money,
which I can't forget,

654
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:44,661
You know how much gold that is?

655
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:47,864
It's that much. And you want
to put it in a space that big?

656
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:51,500
<i>You folks are still operating on the
bulk system as opposed to content.</i>

657
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,001
<i>I'll reduce it to the size I need.</i>

658
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,869
<i>And still retain all its properties.</i>

659
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,527
How?

660
00:42:57,528 --> 00:43:00,184
<i>I'll get into that later.
First buy the gold.</i>

661
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:02,841
Buy it? Jake, in order to
buy $120,000 worth of gold,

662
00:43:02,845 --> 00:43:04,911
You need $120,000.

663
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:06,679
<i>So? Is that a problem?</i>

664
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,013
A problem?

665
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:12,250
My entire capital is tied up
in my next paycheck.

666
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:13,985
<i>Then what's the alternative?</i>

667
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:15,720
I don't know what
the alternative is. I...

668
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:16,821
Hi.

669
00:43:22,294 --> 00:43:23,926
<i>Traditionally known in horse racing...</i>

670
00:43:23,928 --> 00:43:25,227
<i>Boy.</i>

671
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:33,734
What are you doing?

672
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,686
Borrowing your tv.

673
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:37,637
Just bring me a beer and forget I'm here.

674
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,105
Hi, Jake.

675
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:41,307
Link...

676
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:44,176
Wife's worked out an equitable
tv schedule for the day.

677
00:43:44,178 --> 00:43:47,779
The Peachtree Derby and the
football game's on your set,

678
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:49,914
And the metropolitan opera on mine.

679
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:52,016
Can't you see I'm busy?

680
00:43:52,018 --> 00:43:54,184
Doing what?
Playing with your pussycat?

681
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:55,885
Link...
Franklin, please.

682
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:58,787
I've got a bundle bet on the Peachtree.

683
00:44:06,863 --> 00:44:09,597
<i>Frank, we've got problems
to solve, things to do.</i>

684
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,764
What?

685
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:13,867
Link, I'm sorry but I'm
gonna have to ask you...

686
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,604
They're at the post.
You want a peanut?

687
00:44:17,606 --> 00:44:18,705
No.

688
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:42,127
Come on, Sweet Jake.
Let's go.

689
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:44,997
Sweet Jake?

690
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:47,866
Yeah, it's a hunch bet.
100 on the nose at 15 to 1.

691
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:49,267
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger,

692
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,702
And I'm gonna be 1,500 in front,

693
00:44:51,704 --> 00:44:54,738
And you'll be licking mackerel fillet.

694
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,140
Did you forget my beer or
did I drink it already?

695
00:44:57,142 --> 00:44:59,174
Never mind, I'll get it.

696
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:03,110
I'll try to get rid of him.

697
00:45:03,112 --> 00:45:04,878
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

698
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,013
<i>Did you hear what he said, Frank?</i>

699
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:09,115
<i>If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1500.</i>

700
00:45:09,117 --> 00:45:11,750
So? <i>So if Link can win $1500,</i>

701
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:13,818
<i>Why can't we win 120,000?</i>

702
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,253
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
He just made a bet.

703
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,755
He could win 1500.
It doesn't mean he will.

704
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,723
<i>With me on his side, he will.</i>

705
00:45:20,725 --> 00:45:22,891
Did you say something?
No, nothing.

706
00:45:22,893 --> 00:45:24,959
Okay, okay.
Let's pipe down.

707
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:28,996
I got 100 big ones riding on this nag.

708
00:45:28,998 --> 00:45:30,330
<i>And they're off.</i>

709
00:45:30,332 --> 00:45:32,398
<i>It's Denny's Doll breaking on top.</i>

710
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,334
<i>Attaboy Star. Daddy's Poppa on the outside.</i>

711
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:37,869
<i>Booky Baby on the rail and Seabottom...</i>

712
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:39,637
Where's Sweet Jake?

713
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:41,806
<i>Sweet Jake is still in the gate.</i>

714
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:43,974
<i>At the clubhouse turn, it's
Denny's Doll by half a length.</i>

715
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,875
<i>Attaboy Star, and Daddy's Poppa.</i>

716
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:48,177
<i>Sweet Jake is finally out of the gate.</i>

717
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:52,948
<i>Sweet Jake is moving. He's
way behind, but he's moving.</i>

718
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,918
<i>I think he stopped to have lunch.</i>

719
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,021
I don't believe this.
Eat on your own time!

720
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,989
See what I mean?

721
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,192
<i>Now, it's Attaboy Star...</i>

722
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,795
Sweet Jake! I should have bet
on the Metropolitan Opera.

723
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:11,165
<i>Daddy's Poppa moving up, and Seabottom.</i>

724
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:14,534
<i>It's Attaboy Star by a length. Booky
Baby, Denny's Doll and Seabottom.</i>

725
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:19,238
<i>Sweet Jake's finished
eating and started running.</i>

726
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,807
<i>And, ladies and gentlemen, is he running!</i>

727
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:25,477
<i>But not even Silky Sullivan could
come from this far behind.</i>

728
00:46:25,479 --> 00:46:27,479
<i>It's Booky Baby taking the lead.</i>

729
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:30,415
<i>Daddy's Poppa moving into
second, and Attaboy Star.</i>

730
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:33,251
<i>And making up incredible
ground is Sweet Jake.</i>

731
00:46:33,253 --> 00:46:36,787
<i>I have never seen anything like this.
But can he catch the pack?</i>

732
00:46:39,024 --> 00:46:41,991
<i>At the top of the stretch.
It's Booky Baby in the lead.</i>

733
00:46:41,993 --> 00:46:44,043
<i>Daddy's Poppa.</i>

734
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:46,094
<i>And turning for home, it's Sweet Jake.</i>

735
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:49,398
Come on, Jake. Come on.
Give him the whip, dummy.

736
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,333
<i>Racetrack, and he's flying!</i>

737
00:46:51,335 --> 00:46:55,036
Attaboy! Here we go. Come on.
Come on. Come on, Jake.

738
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:57,038
Attaway. Come on, Jake.

739
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,108
Come on. Come on, boy!
That's it! Hot dog money.

740
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,043
We got it! Hoo!

741
00:47:03,045 --> 00:47:05,996
Yee-haw!

742
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:08,948
<i>The story here today, ladies and
gentlemen, is Sweet Jake. Never in...</i>

743
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:11,383
Fifteen hundred smackeroos!

744
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:13,985
That calls for another beer.

745
00:47:13,987 --> 00:47:15,219
How about you?
I'm buying.

746
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:16,954
No. No, thanks.

747
00:47:16,956 --> 00:47:20,023
Incidentally, Frank, you
could use another six-pack.

748
00:47:23,061 --> 00:47:27,363
I got a feeling I'm gonna murder
them on the football games.

749
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:28,997
<i>Frank, that's the solution to the money.</i>

750
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:35,001
No, no, it's ridiculous.
It won't work.

751
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:36,969
<i>Why won't it?</i>

752
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:39,538
Well... In the first place, I don't
know anything about placing a bet.

753
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,006
I wouldn't know where to go, what to do.

754
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:43,174
I gotta call Ernie with my football bets.

755
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:45,476
The Rams, Patriot game starts in 25 minutes.

756
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:47,311
<i>I guess we're gonna have to
take in another partner.</i>

757
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:49,212
Who?
<i>Him.</i>

758
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:51,013
Did you say something, Frank?

759
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:53,048
Link? Do you
think that's wise?

760
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,183
Do I think what's wise?
Who are you talking to?

761
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:57,118
<i>Ask how many football games we can bet on.</i>

762
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,086
But... Who are you talking to?

763
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:00,253
<i>Ask him!</i>
Frank?

764
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,587
It's crazy.
Buddy?

765
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:02,988
What?
Who?

766
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,990
How many football games on tv today?

767
00:48:04,992 --> 00:48:07,559
Three pro games. East,
midwest, far west. Who?

768
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:09,845
<i>Brief him.</i>

769
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:12,130
Frank, have you got a tape
machine going or something?

770
00:48:12,132 --> 00:48:14,932
I don't think it's a good idea, but okay.

771
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,935
You know, if I didn't know better,
I'd say you were talking to the cat.

772
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,970
I was.

773
00:48:19,972 --> 00:48:22,005
Right.

774
00:48:22,007 --> 00:48:26,209
Look, Frank, listen, this can happen
to anybody in government service.

775
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:28,945
That's why they have staff psychiatrists.
First thing Monday...

776
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,013
Link, take a deep breath.

777
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:32,381
Okay.

778
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,649
Remember that artichoke?

779
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:40,554
Well, it all started when this spaceship...

780
00:48:40,556 --> 00:48:42,422
Spaceship? ...From another galaxy.

781
00:48:42,424 --> 00:48:45,057
Landed in a field, out near Palmdale.

782
00:48:48,062 --> 00:48:51,196
Frank, let me get this straight, okay?

783
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:54,032
Now, you're trying to tell me.

784
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:57,268
That your little pussycat
came from another planet.

785
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,936
From another galaxy in a spacecraft,

786
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:00,604
And landed right here on Earth?

787
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:02,339
Is that what you're trying to say, Frank?
That's right.

788
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,073
<i>You're squeezing, link.</i>
See? You heard him talk.

789
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:06,943
Look.

790
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,378
I mean, I don't know how
you're doing your...

791
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,113
Your little trick, you know.

792
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,048
But I gotta tell you something, pal.

793
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,916
It's dumb. Very dumb.

794
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,550
So, you know what I'm gonna do?

795
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:18,969
I'm gonna drink your last beer,

796
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,387
Then I'm gonna watch three football
games on your television set,

797
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:25,024
And then I'm going home,
because this is dumb, Frank.

798
00:49:25,026 --> 00:49:26,191
Real dumb.

799
00:50:00,356 --> 00:50:02,723
Now, that's dumb.

800
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,726
Aw, Link, look. Listen to me for one minute.

801
00:50:07,962 --> 00:50:09,227
I don't want to hear it, Frank.

802
00:50:09,229 --> 00:50:10,428
He was trying to prove...
I don't want...

803
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,696
Something...
To hear it, Frank!

804
00:50:12,698 --> 00:50:14,164
Okay?
Okay.

805
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:15,331
Thank you.

806
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:48,558
All right.

807
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,493
That does it, Frank!
I'm going home.

808
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,361
And watch the Metropolitan Opera.

809
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:55,997
Now, Link. We need your help.
Jake needs your help!

810
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:57,665
I don't want to hear about it!

811
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,366
We need money to fix... Frank, I...

812
00:50:59,368 --> 00:51:01,234
You're the only person I know
who knows how to place a bet.

813
00:51:01,236 --> 00:51:02,556
I don't anything about placing...

814
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:30,793
What kind of a spaceship?

815
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,701
Hey, you're beautiful.

816
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,039
Well, you're down 200, sucker.

817
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,241
Would you like to double it?

818
00:51:49,243 --> 00:51:51,042
Earnest Ernie's Sporting Club.

819
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:53,210
Weasel speaking.
What's your pleasure?

820
00:51:53,212 --> 00:51:56,179
Yeah. Give me four balls.
I'll double it.

821
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:57,813
What do you say, Sarasota Slim?

822
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,714
I say give him five.

823
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,816
The man says, "give him five." you got it.

824
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,751
Honest Harry holds.

825
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:05,619
Link, can you make it fast?

826
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:07,721
We got a hot one on the rotisserie.

827
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,422
Can I trust him?

828
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:12,057
Would a crook have a name like Honest Harry?

829
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,060
You wanna bet what?

830
00:52:16,463 --> 00:52:18,162
Hold on.

831
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:19,830
Hey, Ernie.
Ernie, come here.

832
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:22,132
Yeah.

833
00:52:22,134 --> 00:52:24,400
Ernie, it's Link. He wants to take
all his winnings from Sweet Jake.

834
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:26,468
And parlay the three football games.

835
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:29,103
You're kidding?
A three-game parlay?

836
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:31,672
Yeah. It'll come to 120 g's if he makes it.

837
00:52:31,674 --> 00:52:34,207
It's like taking candy from a baby, Weasel.

838
00:52:34,209 --> 00:52:36,075
He's down.
You're down.

839
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:43,547
Hold it right there.

840
00:52:47,486 --> 00:52:50,220
General? General?

841
00:52:50,222 --> 00:52:52,622
Fingerprints. Fingerprints, sir.
They found fingerprints.

842
00:52:52,624 --> 00:52:53,856
Well, now.
On top of the hull,

843
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:55,557
Inside the cabin, everywhere.

844
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,459
And they are the prints of a human being.

845
00:52:58,461 --> 00:53:00,828
In other words, whatever power
brought this ship here,

846
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,131
They were aided and abetted
by some disloyal American.

847
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:07,434
Gentlemen, we are dealing
with a collaborator.

848
00:53:07,436 --> 00:53:09,402
I want the face that matches these prints.

849
00:53:09,404 --> 00:53:10,703
Put it through the computer.

850
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:12,571
Double pronto, sir.
General!

851
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:16,107
General!

852
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,374
Look at this.
Sir, they found more.

853
00:53:17,376 --> 00:53:19,109
What in blazes is that?

854
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:22,378
Fine hair, sir. The pilot
was wearing a fur coat.

855
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,147
But even more important,
we found tiny prints.

856
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:28,416
In a claw-like pattern,
like a... Like a pussycat's.

857
00:53:29,185 --> 00:53:30,784
Pussycat?

858
00:53:30,786 --> 00:53:32,852
Why aren't I hearing
some tickety-tacks?

859
00:53:32,854 --> 00:53:34,354
What about those fingerprints?

860
00:53:34,355 --> 00:53:35,855
There's a printout about
to come through, sir.

861
00:53:35,857 --> 00:53:37,489
Sir...

862
00:53:37,491 --> 00:53:39,891
What do you want me to do with this?

863
00:53:39,893 --> 00:53:42,293
Get it checked, sir.
Coming through, sir.

864
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:49,498
"I.D. Wilson,
Frank. Doctor.

865
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,167
"Social security, 631070829.

866
00:53:52,169 --> 00:53:56,704
"1951 to '55. US Navy.
'55 to '62, Caltech.

867
00:53:56,706 --> 00:53:59,373
"Current employment,
theoretician. ERL"?

868
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:00,707
That's my Dr. Wilson!

869
00:54:00,709 --> 00:54:02,408
The scoundrel.

870
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,209
We'll have him in the slammer
within the hour, sir.

871
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:05,743
And blow the whole ball game?

872
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:08,278
Gentlemen,
we're after Mr. Big,

873
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,180
And this double-crossing
fink is gonna lead us to him.

874
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:13,916
To find the rat, tail the cat.

875
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,183
Cat?

876
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,985
It's just an expression.

877
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:22,055
Want a peanut, Jake?

878
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:23,789
<i>No, thanks. I'll wait
till Frank gets back.</i>

879
00:54:26,928 --> 00:54:28,260
The Rams still ahead?

880
00:54:28,262 --> 00:54:30,495
Ahead? Frank,
the Rams won the game.

881
00:54:30,497 --> 00:54:33,831
And without Jake's help.
Without your help, buddy.

882
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:36,767
Great, let's break open the six-pack.
What will you have, Jake?

883
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:38,268
<i>Did you get some more of that tuna?</i>

884
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,003
Yeah, yeah.
Coming right up.

885
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:42,704
<i>There's
the two-minute warning.</i>

886
00:54:42,706 --> 00:54:45,573
<i>Oilers leading 21-19,
Houston driving.</i>

887
00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:48,008
Another one in the bag, Franklin.

888
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:50,043
Come in.

889
00:54:50,045 --> 00:54:51,844
Frank?

890
00:54:51,846 --> 00:54:55,981
Hi. Lucybelle
insisted on coming, too.

891
00:54:55,983 --> 00:54:57,682
- Coming?
- Yeah, the picnic.

892
00:54:58,985 --> 00:55:00,985
The picnic.

893
00:55:00,987 --> 00:55:03,287
Beer, Liz?
No, thanks.

894
00:55:03,856 --> 00:55:05,689
Is something wrong?

895
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:11,460
Is his croup worse?

896
00:55:11,462 --> 00:55:13,495
Whose?
Jake's.

897
00:55:13,497 --> 00:55:16,698
Yeah. Right.
I was up all night.

898
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,965
Really?
Yeah.

899
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,466
It's gone into hyperzemia.

900
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:21,301
What's hyperzemia?

901
00:55:21,303 --> 00:55:22,669
It's what Jake's got.

902
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:24,971
What did your doctor do for him yesterday?

903
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:26,772
He gave him two aspirin.

904
00:55:26,774 --> 00:55:28,940
Two aspirin?

905
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:30,808
What's that?
What's happening, Frank?

906
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,760
I don't know.

907
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:34,711
Two aspirin. No wonder you're feeling worse.

908
00:55:34,713 --> 00:55:36,646
How did he get the ball?
Interception, I guess.

909
00:55:36,648 --> 00:55:38,614
What this cat needs is some expert help.

910
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:39,781
Get him.

911
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:41,382
Dr. Wenger.
Get him.

912
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:43,984
Yeah, okay. I'll go get him.
I'll be right back.

913
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:46,086
Get him.
Somebody tackle him.

914
00:55:46,088 --> 00:55:47,921
<i>Hi, sweetie. Can I get you anything?</i>

915
00:55:47,923 --> 00:55:51,391
Okay. Out of bounds
on the 30.

916
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:54,327
Jake, why didn't you do something?

917
00:55:54,329 --> 00:55:58,097
<i>And spoil everybody's fun? Look,
guys, there's plenty of time.</i>

918
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:00,432
<i>Anybody ever tell you, you got
a terrific set of whiskers?</i>

919
00:56:00,434 --> 00:56:02,801
Jake, for heaven's sakes,
will you pay attention?

920
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:05,336
They're within field-goal range.
If they make it, we're sunk.

921
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:08,405
<i>No problem, believe me.
A little tuna, sweetheart?</i>

922
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:12,542
Jake, concentrate, please. The
next few seconds could be crucial.

923
00:56:12,544 --> 00:56:13,876
<i>Takes a time out.</i>

924
00:56:13,878 --> 00:56:15,344
Time out.

925
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:17,012
I appreciate it, doctor.

926
00:56:17,014 --> 00:56:18,980
At least you could have waited
till the game was over.

927
00:56:18,982 --> 00:56:20,848
I have $10 on chicago.

928
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,916
You've got it on.
What's happening?

929
00:56:22,918 --> 00:56:23,883
Time out.

930
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:25,751
This is Dr. Wenger.

931
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:27,753
Dr. Wenger,
here's the patient.

932
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:29,988
I definitely think he needs your attention.

933
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,824
All right.

934
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,859
How did they get to the 30? Interception.

935
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:37,862
Happened while we were in the elevator.

936
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:39,597
<i>Or are they gonna try for a field goal?</i>

937
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,998
What do you think, doctor?

938
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,433
I think they should try for a field goal.

939
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:44,901
About the cat.

940
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:47,370
Well, he's tense.
Yes, he's very tense.

941
00:56:47,372 --> 00:56:49,772
The shoulder muscles are all bunched up.

942
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,541
Where do you wanna do the examination?

943
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,609
Right here will be fine.

944
00:56:55,611 --> 00:56:58,445
Okay. Let me get
this out of the way.

945
00:56:58,447 --> 00:57:01,114
Also, let's... First thing,
get this collar off.

946
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:02,949
<i>Hey!</i>

947
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:05,468
Good thinking, Chicago.

948
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:07,986
<i>This year. He's never missed
inside the 35-yard line.</i>

949
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:09,922
Get through that line now.

950
00:57:09,924 --> 00:57:11,857
That guy can't kick a ball 60 yards.

951
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:13,859
Block that kick.
Block that kick.

952
00:57:15,629 --> 00:57:17,962
Will you calm down now?
Hold the cat, please.

953
00:57:17,964 --> 00:57:20,764
Jake, you better do something.

954
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:22,465
What are you doing?
Where's his collar?

955
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:23,566
Block that...

956
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:24,667
It's right here, Frank.

957
00:57:25,836 --> 00:57:27,602
Give it to me, Liz.
Give it to me.

958
00:57:27,604 --> 00:57:29,971
Frank, I'm just gonna hold the...

959
00:57:29,973 --> 00:57:32,740
I'm gonna give him a sedative.
No, no, don't do that!

960
00:57:34,944 --> 00:57:37,077
Frank, let go of the cat.

961
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:40,947
<i>There's the snap.
It's down. The kick is up.</i>

962
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:43,749
<i>It's long enough.
It's straight enough. It's...</i>

963
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,718
<i>It's...</i>

964
00:57:48,154 --> 00:57:50,120
<i>It's flat!</i>

965
00:57:50,122 --> 00:57:52,990
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i> We won!

966
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:55,859
<i>The ball just flattened out in midair.
And there's the gun.</i>

967
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:57,511
Jake?

968
00:57:57,512 --> 00:57:59,162
<i>The Oilers have won it 21 to 19.</i>

969
00:57:59,164 --> 00:58:01,564
I told you not to do that!

970
00:58:01,566 --> 00:58:04,800
I only came up here
as a favor to a neighbor.

971
00:58:04,802 --> 00:58:06,902
As a rule, I do not make house calls.

972
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:09,838
You sure picked a dumb
time to break your rule.

973
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,540
Dr. Link!

974
00:58:12,542 --> 00:58:15,843
Look, Dr. Wenger, please forgive him.
He's a new cat-owner...

975
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:17,945
Jake. Jake.
It's me, Jake.

976
00:58:17,947 --> 00:58:21,181
Frank, we're finished. He's blotto.

977
00:58:21,183 --> 00:58:26,786
Well, look on the bright side.
San Diego could still win.

978
00:58:26,788 --> 00:58:29,021
Yeah, and San Diego could still lose.

979
00:58:29,023 --> 00:58:31,590
And where does that
leave this poor little guy?

980
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,726
He's blown his rendezvous,
and my 1500 clams.

981
00:58:34,728 --> 00:58:36,994
That was very rude, Frank.

982
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:38,462
Liz, butt out.
What?

983
00:58:38,464 --> 00:58:39,930
Cancel the bet.
Call Ernie.

984
00:58:39,932 --> 00:58:41,665
He'll never buy it.

985
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:43,533
Look, what's going on here?

986
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:45,568
Jake, we got problems, Jake. Speak to me.

987
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,204
Is everybody crazy?

988
00:58:48,205 --> 00:58:50,839
Frank, the line is busy. We'll never
get through. He's taking bets.

989
00:58:50,841 --> 00:58:52,740
We'd better get down there. Like yesterday.

990
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:56,143
Now, look...
Just a minute, Frank.

991
00:58:56,145 --> 00:58:59,980
I would like... No, I demand an explanation.
What's going on?

992
00:58:59,982 --> 00:59:02,048
Later, Liz.
No. Now.

993
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,718
Liz, we have got exactly six
minutes before that game starts.

994
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,152
Watch it, Link.
I'm a black belt.

995
00:59:07,154 --> 00:59:10,588
Okay. We'll tell you
in the elevator.

996
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,656
Remember that meeting we had with Dr.
Heffel.

997
00:59:12,658 --> 00:59:14,224
And General Stilton at the ERL?

998
00:59:17,062 --> 00:59:18,995
Outer space?

999
00:59:20,698 --> 00:59:22,931
Frank Wilson, are you putting me on?

1000
00:59:22,933 --> 00:59:24,866
No, no. Remember that artichoke? Well, yeah.

1001
00:59:38,114 --> 00:59:42,082
Dydee one calling Hopscotch.
Come in, Big Cheese.

1002
00:59:42,084 --> 00:59:44,517
This is Big Cheese.
Go ahead, Dydee One.

1003
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:47,052
<i>Do you still have contact with the subject?</i>

1004
00:59:47,054 --> 00:59:49,554
Yes, sir.
Also that garbage expert.

1005
00:59:49,556 --> 00:59:51,522
And the dame from the car pool.

1006
00:59:51,524 --> 00:59:54,591
And they're all going into
Earnest Ernie's pool hall.

1007
00:59:54,593 --> 00:59:56,225
Looks like a mafia
tie-in, General.

1008
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:58,760
Mafia?

1009
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,929
What kind of an operation you
running down there, Heffel?

1010
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:06,866
Lucky!

1011
01:00:07,835 --> 01:00:09,100
Really lucky.

1012
01:00:09,102 --> 01:00:10,935
Ernie? Ernie?

1013
01:00:10,937 --> 01:00:12,636
Excuse me. Ernie?

1014
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:15,304
Hi, Ernie.

1015
01:00:15,306 --> 01:00:17,673
Well, look who's here.
Hiya, doc.

1016
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,941
Ernie,

1017
01:00:19,943 --> 01:00:22,910
I wanna cancel my Chargers bet.

1018
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:24,978
You wanna cancel your Chargers bet?

1019
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,713
Yeah, cancel my Chargers bet.

1020
01:00:26,715 --> 01:00:28,648
Really? Why?

1021
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:31,017
I don't know.
Just a hunch, sort of.

1022
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:34,653
Hey, not a bad hunch. The
Chargers are 10 points behind.

1023
01:00:35,155 --> 01:00:36,988
Already?

1024
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:41,092
16, boss, 16. Steelers
just scored another one.

1025
01:00:41,094 --> 01:00:43,794
Sorry, doc.
Is he taking a nap?

1026
01:00:43,796 --> 01:00:44,995
Yeah.

1027
01:00:44,997 --> 01:00:46,563
Is that tv picture still out?

1028
01:00:46,565 --> 01:00:49,966
Well, there goes 120,000.
1,500 of which is mine.

1029
01:00:49,968 --> 01:00:51,767
Isn't there anything you can do?

1030
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:54,169
Not while Jake is out. Jake, Jake, wake up.
We need you, Jake.

1031
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:55,336
Frank, is he breathing?

1032
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:57,004
He's snoring.

1033
01:00:57,006 --> 01:00:59,639
Okay. Okay. Isn't there
anything else we can bet on?

1034
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:02,775
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we could get lucky.
Another football game?

1035
01:01:02,777 --> 01:01:04,209
Next Sunday.
Basketball?

1036
01:01:04,211 --> 01:01:05,977
Tuesday night.
Hockey?

1037
01:01:05,979 --> 01:01:07,878
Hockey?
Hockey.

1038
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,347
Ernie, Ernie, is there a hockey game today.

1039
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:11,881
That we could put a few bucks on?

1040
01:01:11,883 --> 01:01:12,948
Sorry.

1041
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,749
Horse race?

1042
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:16,150
Boxing?

1043
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:17,985
Demolition derby?
Anything to get even.

1044
01:01:17,987 --> 01:01:19,353
No.

1045
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:21,755
But, hey, if you want a little action,

1046
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:23,790
There's always my good friend Sarasota Slim.

1047
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:25,725
Sarasota Slim?
Yes.

1048
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:27,659
He indulges occasionally
in a friendly pool game.

1049
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:29,862
With a slight wager on the side.

1050
01:01:29,864 --> 01:01:31,163
Nothing doing.
Why not?

1051
01:01:31,165 --> 01:01:32,297
Well, he's a hustler.

1052
01:01:32,299 --> 01:01:33,631
Who isn't?

1053
01:01:33,633 --> 01:01:35,299
Okay, it's a bet.
Frank.

1054
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:36,733
What are the odds?

1055
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,201
You against Sarasota Slim?

1056
01:01:38,203 --> 01:01:39,902
Right.
Frank.

1057
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,904
Well, because I want to give
you a chance to break even.

1058
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,006
And because I like your style,

1059
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:46,108
Let's say 8 to 1.

1060
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:48,877
That's all?
What about him?

1061
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:51,930
Me?
Link?

1062
01:01:51,931 --> 01:01:54,982
Well, considering the shape
he's in, I'd say maybe 10 to 1.

1063
01:01:54,984 --> 01:01:57,017
What about the lady?

1064
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:58,284
Me?
Liz?

1065
01:01:58,286 --> 01:02:01,754
Considering the shape she's in, 20 to 1.

1066
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:02,988
Okay, you got a bet.

1067
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:05,440
Frank!

1068
01:02:05,441 --> 01:02:07,891
Arch, set 'em up. Another
sucker just swam into the net.

1069
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:10,961
Frank, I don't know
anything about this game.

1070
01:02:10,963 --> 01:02:12,896
Frank, are you bananas?

1071
01:02:12,898 --> 01:02:15,198
That guy can make a pool ball
sit up and do the boogaloo.

1072
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,367
I know, but I've got the equalizer...
The collar.

1073
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:20,369
How are you gonna do that?
Jake's out.

1074
01:02:20,371 --> 01:02:22,704
I've used it to repair the spaceship.

1075
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:24,105
You? Yes. I've flown and everything.

1076
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:27,442
Charlie, give me the special,
and heavy on the onions.

1077
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:28,776
Taking a nap?

1078
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,110
Yeah.

1079
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:32,445
Throw in a few chili peppers?

1080
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,346
Frank, I don't want to take the risk...

1081
01:02:34,348 --> 01:02:36,047
Liz, you've got to do it.

1082
01:02:36,049 --> 01:02:38,115
I'm desperate.
No money, no gold.

1083
01:02:38,117 --> 01:02:40,283
No gold, no liftoff.
But...

1084
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:46,021
But if we deliver,
look what we get in return.

1085
01:02:46,023 --> 01:02:48,989
The solution to half the
problems on this planet.

1086
01:02:51,793 --> 01:02:53,893
Just show me how to hold the pole.

1087
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,194
Good girl.

1088
01:02:55,196 --> 01:02:57,296
Now, we need a stake.
I've got about 12 bucks.

1089
01:02:57,298 --> 01:02:59,031
It's in my hip pocket.
Will you get it for me?

1090
01:02:59,033 --> 01:03:01,166
Yeah, okay, that's 12.
Now, how much do you have?

1091
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:03,968
Me? I think I got 20.

1092
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,169
20? Liz?

1093
01:03:06,972 --> 01:03:08,938
I just have my mad money.

1094
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,873
Give it to us, please?

1095
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:12,874
Come on.

1096
01:03:18,814 --> 01:03:21,514
Boy, when this dame gets mad, she gets mad.

1097
01:03:23,184 --> 01:03:26,418
I was going to buy
a whole spring wardrobe, Link.

1098
01:03:28,922 --> 01:03:30,054
Okay. Ernie.

1099
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,056
Boss, here's the bankroll.

1100
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,025
Ernie, we bet 300 at 20 to 1.

1101
01:03:35,027 --> 01:03:37,444
Check.

1102
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:39,862
Not in your lifetime,
Ernie. Honest Harry holds.

1103
01:03:39,865 --> 01:03:43,399
All right, you want Honest
Harry, you got Honest Harry.

1104
01:03:43,401 --> 01:03:46,435
300 at 20 to 1.
That's 6,000 clams.

1105
01:03:46,437 --> 01:03:49,037
And here's our 300.

1106
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,940
Earnest ernie, 6,000.
The mark, 300.

1107
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:54,441
6,300.

1108
01:03:54,443 --> 01:03:59,112
And may the best man win.
Or woman, as the case may be.

1109
01:03:59,114 --> 01:04:02,515
Young lady, it's your break.

1110
01:04:02,517 --> 01:04:05,584
Come on, Charlie, don't be
so stingy with the onions.

1111
01:04:05,586 --> 01:04:08,420
Here, take the collar, Liz.
Okay, here.

1112
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:11,523
Link, keep your eye on him.
If he blinks just once...

1113
01:04:11,525 --> 01:04:14,325
Miss? Do you mind? We're waiting.

1114
01:04:17,997 --> 01:04:19,997
Now, that's a sandwich. Right?

1115
01:04:19,999 --> 01:04:21,598
Right.

1116
01:04:26,537 --> 01:04:27,969
Taking a nap.

1117
01:04:27,971 --> 01:04:29,370
Naturally.

1118
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,347
Nice break, young lady.
Very nice.

1119
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:17,949
Unfortunately, you didn't sink anything,

1120
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:19,216
But there's always tomorrow.

1121
01:05:21,353 --> 01:05:23,286
Show her how to do it.

1122
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:26,455
Okay, Slim, go get her.

1123
01:05:26,457 --> 01:05:29,658
I can't watch this.

1124
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:32,560
Frank, I'm sorry.

1125
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:34,461
No, no, no.
It's not your fault.

1126
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:45,037
Attaway, Slim.
Attaway, baby.

1127
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,939
I guess we are licked. If only
Jake hadn't got knocked out...

1128
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:50,107
Frank! Frank, look.

1129
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:51,474
Jake!

1130
01:05:52,376 --> 01:05:54,376
Jake?

1131
01:05:54,378 --> 01:05:56,578
Frank, he must have just woke up.

1132
01:05:58,315 --> 01:06:00,799
Jake, are you all right?

1133
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,284
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
Where am I? What happened?</i>

1134
01:06:03,286 --> 01:06:05,919
I'm Liz Bartlett. I'm
responsible for your being...

1135
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:07,120
Liz, Liz.

1136
01:06:07,622 --> 01:06:08,954
Well.

1137
01:06:08,956 --> 01:06:11,089
Jake, we have got to win this pool game.

1138
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:16,927
That's money
in the bank. Look at it!

1139
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,999
Honest Harry, guess who's here?

1140
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:25,400
Ernie?

1141
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:29,103
Here's our last 60 bucks.
What are the odds now?

1142
01:06:29,105 --> 01:06:30,504
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

1143
01:06:30,506 --> 01:06:32,072
No bet.
No bet?

1144
01:06:32,074 --> 01:06:33,973
It's part of my code of ethics.

1145
01:06:33,975 --> 01:06:35,941
Always leave the sucker rent money.

1146
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:37,676
That's not fair!

1147
01:06:37,678 --> 01:06:39,210
Honest Harry?

1148
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:42,379
If the mark wants to go complete top city,

1149
01:06:42,381 --> 01:06:45,115
He's got a constitutional right.

1150
01:06:45,117 --> 01:06:48,017
And I stand on it.
The odds, Ernie?

1151
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:51,020
It's ridiculous. But if I
didn't have no principles,

1152
01:06:51,022 --> 01:06:52,688
I'd say 100 to 1.

1153
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:57,992
Suppose... Suppose she gives
Sarasota Slim 12 balls?

1154
01:06:57,994 --> 01:07:00,027
What a sense of humor!

1155
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:01,161
300 to 1.

1156
01:07:04,398 --> 01:07:05,530
And the break.

1157
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:07,265
The break?

1158
01:07:07,267 --> 01:07:09,200
500 to 1.

1159
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:11,235
<i>And blindfolded.</i>

1160
01:07:11,237 --> 01:07:12,569
What?
Blindfolded!

1161
01:07:15,506 --> 01:07:17,472
2,000 to 1.

1162
01:07:17,474 --> 01:07:19,173
You're on.

1163
01:07:19,175 --> 01:07:22,009
$60 at 2,000 to 1.

1164
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:24,011
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

1165
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:26,413
Are you seriously serious?

1166
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:28,448
You're not thinking of welching, are you?

1167
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:30,349
But I thought you was putting me on.

1168
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:35,087
Earnest Ernie, it would not do
your reputation any credit.

1169
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:37,656
If word was to circulate that you reneged.

1170
01:07:37,658 --> 01:07:40,258
On a wager duly offered and accepted.

1171
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:55,204
Get the big bundle, Weasel.

1172
01:07:55,206 --> 01:07:56,772
But, boss, that's a...
Get it!

1173
01:08:00,344 --> 01:08:02,544
All right.

1174
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:06,781
Let me understand this. Slim
gets 12 balls and the break?

1175
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,783
And she shoots blindfolded.

1176
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,119
She'll never get to the table.

1177
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:15,088
120 g's, boss.

1178
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:23,562
Don't put it away, Honest Harry,
you ain't gonna hold it long.

1179
01:08:25,632 --> 01:08:28,499
All right, Slim.
Show 'em no mercy.

1180
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:42,533
Nice. Nice break, slim.

1181
01:09:42,535 --> 01:09:47,304
Unfortunately, you didn't sink
nothing, but there's always tomorrow.

1182
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:50,573
I believe I'm up.
Hold it.

1183
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:52,341
Blindfolded.

1184
01:10:05,422 --> 01:10:07,221
Could you back off?

1185
01:10:40,553 --> 01:10:42,552
Thank you.
It was nothing.

1186
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,491
You did it, Jake.
You did it.

1187
01:10:48,893 --> 01:10:50,692
Thank you, sir.

1188
01:10:50,694 --> 01:10:52,860
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1189
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:54,795
It was really nothing.
Thank you.

1190
01:10:54,797 --> 01:10:59,866
Frank, we won! Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks, all of you. Thank you.

1191
01:11:32,432 --> 01:11:34,865
I'm sorry about things being
upside down, Mr. Olympus,

1192
01:11:34,867 --> 01:11:37,667
But I took these pictures
at risk of life and limb.

1193
01:11:46,477 --> 01:11:49,244
There's the cat, sir.
Notice his collar?

1194
01:12:08,898 --> 01:12:11,265
Well, well.

1195
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:12,799
What did you think
of it, Mr. Olympus?

1196
01:12:12,801 --> 01:12:15,968
It's just mind-boggling,
isn't it?

1197
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:20,871
I mean, it boggled my mind.
Did it boggle yours, sir?

1198
01:12:21,406 --> 01:12:22,872
Thank you, Omar.

1199
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:36,350
Yes, Mr. Stallwood,
you are quite correct.

1200
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:41,022
It is "mind-boggling,"
as you so graphically put it.

1201
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:45,392
The possibilities are infinite.

1202
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:49,895
A revolution in transportation,
space exploration,

1203
01:12:49,897 --> 01:12:52,931
Colonizing the planets.

1204
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:58,469
The man who owns the secret of
this device could control...

1205
01:12:58,471 --> 01:12:59,870
The world, sir?

1206
01:13:01,139 --> 01:13:03,038
The universe.

1207
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,006
My!

1208
01:13:05,008 --> 01:13:07,608
Well, then, sir, I don't suppose it would be.

1209
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:10,877
Out of place to suggest a bonus.

1210
01:13:10,879 --> 01:13:12,845
A bonus?

1211
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,580
A small bonus.

1212
01:13:14,582 --> 01:13:18,517
Mr. Stallwood, if I gain
the secret of that device,

1213
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:23,554
You may well become a very rich man.

1214
01:13:25,457 --> 01:13:26,689
I may?

1215
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:31,726
Sir, I...
Really may?

1216
01:13:32,929 --> 01:13:36,029
Omar, prepare the copter.
We leave at once.

1217
01:13:37,866 --> 01:13:40,932
I must have that collar.

1218
01:13:42,769 --> 01:13:45,402
I will have that collar.

1219
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,838
Okay. All set, General.

1220
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:51,440
Is it fully programmed?

1221
01:13:51,442 --> 01:13:53,041
All the pertinent information fed in.

1222
01:13:53,043 --> 01:13:54,609
Everything we know.

1223
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:56,777
Question number one, sir.

1224
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:58,912
Question number one.

1225
01:13:58,914 --> 01:14:00,947
Who is the pilot?

1226
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,060
It is a pussycat!

1227
01:14:15,062 --> 01:14:17,495
This machine is having a nervous breakdown.

1228
01:14:18,931 --> 01:14:20,430
Get on the ball, young man.

1229
01:14:20,432 --> 01:14:22,832
Feed that information
through again. Reassess.

1230
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:23,899
Yes, sir.

1231
01:14:23,901 --> 01:14:25,734
General Stilton, sir.

1232
01:14:25,736 --> 01:14:27,669
What is it, Sergeant?

1233
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,603
That purchase Dr. Link made this
afternoon, we checked it out.

1234
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:31,539
It's a large quantity of gold.

1235
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:32,907
Gold?
Yes, sir.

1236
01:14:34,477 --> 01:14:36,977
It's a Machiavellian conspiracy.

1237
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:38,011
Radio.

1238
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:45,117
This is Big Cheese calling Dydee One.
Where are you, Dydee One?

1239
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,886
Outside the suspect's apartment.

1240
01:14:47,888 --> 01:14:50,488
Don't let them out of your sight.

1241
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:51,989
Another printout, General.

1242
01:15:02,934 --> 01:15:04,666
Of all the...

1243
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:09,203
Wait a minute. Radio.

1244
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:13,006
Dydee One.

1245
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:15,808
Yes, sir.

1246
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:18,944
Didn't they carry a cat into that pool hall?

1247
01:15:18,946 --> 01:15:20,145
Yes, sir, they did.

1248
01:15:25,852 --> 01:15:28,853
Gentlemen, it's time to move in.

1249
01:15:28,855 --> 01:15:29,987
Colonel.

1250
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:31,922
Captain.

1251
01:15:31,924 --> 01:15:35,025
$120,000 in one lump sum.

1252
01:15:36,261 --> 01:15:38,861
Jake, how'd you like to
hang around for a few days.

1253
01:15:38,863 --> 01:15:41,196
And watch me parlay this into a fortune?

1254
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:42,864
<i>I wish I could hang around.</i>

1255
01:15:42,866 --> 01:15:45,132
I'm sorry, Jake.
The time?

1256
01:15:45,134 --> 01:15:47,033
<i>Yeah.</i>

1257
01:15:49,203 --> 01:15:50,869
<i>Sorry, Lucy.</i>

1258
01:15:50,871 --> 01:15:54,005
<i>Well, I guess I'd better reduce the gold.</i>

1259
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:55,272
Reduce it?

1260
01:15:55,274 --> 01:15:56,906
What are you talking about?

1261
01:15:56,908 --> 01:15:59,508
It's a whole new concept
in calculating mass.

1262
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:02,511
You see, on Jake's planet, they
use a system based on content,

1263
01:16:02,513 --> 01:16:04,530
Rather than on the quantitative scale...

1264
01:16:04,531 --> 01:16:06,548
<i>Frank! You've got a whole
lifetime to explain that.</i>

1265
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:08,116
<i>I've got less than an hour.</i>

1266
01:16:08,118 --> 01:16:10,284
<i>Now, stand back, everybody.</i>

1267
01:16:14,723 --> 01:16:16,889
All right, don't move!
All hands in the air!

1268
01:16:16,891 --> 01:16:18,657
In the air!
Hey! What are you doing?

1269
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:19,724
Dr. Frank Wilson?

1270
01:16:19,726 --> 01:16:21,192
What is this?
You can't butt in here!

1271
01:16:21,194 --> 01:16:23,961
Dr. Frank Wilson,
you are under arrest.

1272
01:16:23,963 --> 01:16:25,562
And the pussycat, General.

1273
01:16:25,564 --> 01:16:26,963
And the pussycat.

1274
01:16:26,965 --> 01:16:28,264
Read them their rights, Colonel.

1275
01:16:28,266 --> 01:16:30,032
Captain?
Sergeant?

1276
01:16:30,034 --> 01:16:31,233
You have the right to remain silent.
Never mind.

1277
01:16:31,235 --> 01:16:33,034
You have the right to remain silent.

1278
01:16:33,036 --> 01:16:35,036
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

1279
01:16:35,038 --> 01:16:36,804
You have the right...

1280
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:45,612
Good heavens.

1281
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:46,913
Frank...

1282
01:16:49,017 --> 01:16:50,116
What happened?

1283
01:16:50,118 --> 01:16:51,984
They're frozen.

1284
01:16:51,986 --> 01:16:53,919
Holy mackerel!

1285
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:56,755
Well, now that they're on to us, how
are we gonna get into Hopscotch?

1286
01:16:56,757 --> 01:16:58,323
You can't zap the whole base.

1287
01:16:58,325 --> 01:17:00,124
<i>Yeah, well, I'll think of something.</i>

1288
01:17:00,126 --> 01:17:01,959
They've probably got
the whole place on alert.

1289
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:04,011
<i>First things first, Frank.</i>

1290
01:17:04,012 --> 01:17:06,062
<i>Let's get this gold reduced, then we'll
worry about getting on the base.</i>

1291
01:17:06,065 --> 01:17:07,864
<i>Now stand back.</i>

1292
01:17:12,737 --> 01:17:14,203
<i>Okay. Here goes.</i>

1293
01:18:02,284 --> 01:18:04,150
That is unbelievable.

1294
01:18:04,886 --> 01:18:06,752
Jake.

1295
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:09,187
Are you all right?

1296
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:10,688
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1297
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:12,890
Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.

1298
01:18:12,892 --> 01:18:15,025
No. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1299
01:18:15,027 --> 01:18:18,227
I think I've got the perfect
way to get us onto the base.

1300
01:18:21,031 --> 01:18:23,031
Maybe we ought to give 'em a buzz.

1301
01:18:23,033 --> 01:18:24,365
Think we ought to give 'em a buzz?

1302
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,300
Yeah, give 'em a buzz.

1303
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:31,871
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.

1304
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:34,073
<i>Come in, Big Cheese.
Come in.</i>

1305
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:37,342
<i>Dydee One calling Big Cheese.</i>

1306
01:18:50,789 --> 01:18:52,722
What's the military doing here?

1307
01:18:52,724 --> 01:18:55,024
This could be complicated, sir.

1308
01:18:55,026 --> 01:18:56,258
What isn't?

1309
01:19:01,965 --> 01:19:03,064
Get that door closed!

1310
01:19:07,035 --> 01:19:09,402
What does it all mean?

1311
01:19:09,404 --> 01:19:14,006
It means it's exceptionally complicated.

1312
01:19:14,008 --> 01:19:17,776
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.
Come in, Big Cheese. Come in.

1313
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:20,044
Dydee One calling Big Cheese.

1314
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:29,285
Here comes General Cheese.
I mean, Stilton.

1315
01:19:30,388 --> 01:19:32,354
Wait a minute. Here.
Hold Jake for a minute.

1316
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:33,788
Yes.

1317
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:35,106
How do I look?

1318
01:19:35,107 --> 01:19:36,423
Could you hold lucy for a minute?

1319
01:19:36,425 --> 01:19:37,957
Do I look like a General?

1320
01:19:38,726 --> 01:19:39,858
Well...

1321
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:42,694
Frank, you look very commanding.

1322
01:19:42,696 --> 01:19:44,929
That'll have to do.
Let's go.

1323
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:46,814
Okay.

1324
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,698
He got the cat.
That's the cat!

1325
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,201
Where's the General going with those two?

1326
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,002
That's the General?

1327
01:19:54,705 --> 01:19:56,037
It's not?

1328
01:19:56,039 --> 01:19:58,205
Open your door!
Open the doors!

1329
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,207
Open the doors!

1330
01:20:01,476 --> 01:20:03,476
Halt! Halt in the
name of the us...

1331
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,379
Fantastic.

1332
01:20:08,381 --> 01:20:10,748
Listen, good luck?

1333
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,250
Yeah, be careful.

1334
01:20:12,251 --> 01:20:13,751
<i>Bye, Lucybelle.
Thanks for everything.</i>

1335
01:20:13,753 --> 01:20:15,419
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

1336
01:20:19,391 --> 01:20:20,723
<i>Bye.</i>

1337
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:23,458
They've escaped?
Yes.

1338
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:27,427
But, fortunately for us, they left
something very valuable behind.

1339
01:20:50,884 --> 01:20:52,116
General Stilton?

1340
01:20:52,118 --> 01:20:53,350
Of course!

1341
01:20:53,352 --> 01:20:55,819
Of course.
I'll sign you in, sir.

1342
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:58,855
General Stilton and cat.
Is the cat cleared, sir?

1343
01:20:58,857 --> 01:20:59,922
What do you think?

1344
01:20:59,924 --> 01:21:02,524
Sorry, sir.

1345
01:21:02,526 --> 01:21:05,927
I want the hangar open and all personnel out.
We're moving the ship.

1346
01:21:05,929 --> 01:21:08,095
But, sir, if we order 'em out of
the hangar, how are you gonna...

1347
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:09,496
Soldier!

1348
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:11,532
Out of the hangar, sir.
Yes, sir.

1349
01:21:19,974 --> 01:21:21,340
Get the hangar doors open.

1350
01:21:21,342 --> 01:21:23,975
All personnel out of the
hangar on the double.

1351
01:21:46,966 --> 01:21:48,932
<i>First, let's get the ship out of the hangar.</i>

1352
01:21:48,934 --> 01:21:49,966
Check.

1353
01:21:58,042 --> 01:22:01,910
To talk to a lawyer and have
him present while you're being...

1354
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:20,025
Colonel?

1355
01:22:20,027 --> 01:22:21,126
Yes, sir.

1356
01:22:28,534 --> 01:22:30,967
<i>Hold it right here, Frank.</i>

1357
01:22:33,972 --> 01:22:35,338
130 to countdown.

1358
01:22:47,984 --> 01:22:51,085
Hurry. Insert the gold
in the microtransformer.

1359
01:22:51,087 --> 01:22:52,519
Right, right.

1360
01:23:07,135 --> 01:23:09,235
Got it.

1361
01:23:09,237 --> 01:23:12,137
<i>Good. Now let's see if we have contact.</i>

1362
01:23:12,139 --> 01:23:17,041
<i>Zunar-J-5 calling mother ship.
Come in, mother.</i>

1363
01:23:17,043 --> 01:23:18,409
Where's the microphone?
How do you transmit?

1364
01:23:18,411 --> 01:23:20,611
<i>Frank!</i>
Okay, okay!

1365
01:23:20,613 --> 01:23:24,281
<i>Zunar-J-5 calling mother ship.
Come in, mother.</i>

1366
01:23:24,283 --> 01:23:27,284
<i>Hi, there, fella. See you made
it with nothing to spare.</i>

1367
01:23:27,286 --> 01:23:28,718
<i>We had problems.</i>

1368
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,120
<i>We are 105 to liftoff.</i>

1369
01:23:31,122 --> 01:23:34,623
<i>Coming in on ray 0392.
Adjust transmuter.</i>

1370
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,875
<i>Adjustment made.</i>

1371
01:23:36,876 --> 01:23:39,126
<i>- Countdown starts at 20.
- Set clinometers.</i>

1372
01:23:39,129 --> 01:23:41,229
<i>Clinometers' set.
Give me a printout, please.</i>

1373
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:43,764
<i>Coming your way without delay.</i>

1374
01:23:43,766 --> 01:23:45,365
That's another cat?

1375
01:23:45,367 --> 01:23:47,233
Yeah.
A real mother.

1376
01:24:00,445 --> 01:24:02,311
I gotta get to that spaceship right away.

1377
01:24:02,313 --> 01:24:03,512
Sir, who are you?

1378
01:24:03,514 --> 01:24:06,047
A friend of Frank...
I mean General Stilton.

1379
01:24:07,316 --> 01:24:09,115
A very good friend.

1380
01:24:10,017 --> 01:24:11,149
Let's go.

1381
01:24:12,519 --> 01:24:14,185
Open the gate.

1382
01:24:15,121 --> 01:24:16,553
My car!

1383
01:24:21,358 --> 01:24:23,157
Them, too.
Never mind them.

1384
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:24,279
Let's get down to Hopscotch.

1385
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,094
Sergeant.
Captain.

1386
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:29,161
Colonel.
General.

1387
01:24:29,163 --> 01:24:30,495
Get in!

1388
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:46,709
<i>Counting down.</i>

1389
01:24:46,711 --> 01:24:47,776
Hey, Frank!

1390
01:24:47,778 --> 01:24:50,111
Hold it, sir, right there.

1391
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:53,280
General, this man says...

1392
01:24:54,316 --> 01:24:56,149
Hey!

1393
01:24:56,151 --> 01:24:57,483
You're not General Stilton.

1394
01:25:01,355 --> 01:25:03,355
Hey, Frank. Link! What are you doing here?

1395
01:25:03,357 --> 01:25:06,658
Frank, it's a nightmare. Liz has
been captured by stallwood.

1396
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:08,493
What... Have you been
hitting the beer?

1397
01:25:08,495 --> 01:25:10,394
Stallwood of supplies and purchasing?

1398
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,562
He's an agent, Frank. For
some guy named Olympus,

1399
01:25:12,564 --> 01:25:14,363
A power-crazed creep
who's trying to...

1400
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:15,797
Frank, he's holding her for ransom.

1401
01:25:15,799 --> 01:25:17,632
<i>Lucybelle, too?</i>

1402
01:25:17,634 --> 01:25:20,301
Yeah, he wants that collar, Jake.
It's the collar or Liz.

1403
01:25:20,303 --> 01:25:21,669
Are they out of their minds? Where is she?

1404
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:23,370
<i>I'm going with you, Frank.</i>

1405
01:25:23,372 --> 01:25:25,105
No, no, no, you don't want
to get stuck here on Earth.

1406
01:25:25,107 --> 01:25:26,539
And you've got a responsibility
to your mission.

1407
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:28,140
<i>But I'm the reason for the mess they're in.</i>

1408
01:25:28,142 --> 01:25:29,374
Do you know where they're taking her? Yeah.

1409
01:25:29,376 --> 01:25:30,775
To some place called Dailey's airport.

1410
01:25:30,777 --> 01:25:32,176
Do you know where it is? Yeah.

1411
01:25:32,178 --> 01:25:33,477
Let's go.

1412
01:25:37,316 --> 01:25:39,349
<i>Frank...</i> Jake, you're going home.

1413
01:25:40,318 --> 01:25:42,117
Now, get in there.

1414
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,286
So long, buddy.

1415
01:25:46,455 --> 01:25:47,654
<i>Yeah.</i>

1416
01:25:49,224 --> 01:25:50,823
Let's go.

1417
01:25:50,825 --> 01:25:53,425
<i>Five, four,</i>

1418
01:25:53,427 --> 01:25:55,393
<i>Three, two.</i>

1419
01:25:56,095 --> 01:25:57,160
<i>Ignite.</i>

1420
01:26:12,109 --> 01:26:13,775
Bye, Jake.

1421
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:16,677
Drop us a card.

1422
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:19,813
<i>Okay, you clowns. Let's move it. Let's go.</i>

1423
01:26:19,815 --> 01:26:21,481
Jake!

1424
01:26:21,483 --> 01:26:24,450
Jake, this is insane. You're
here forever, on Earth.

1425
01:26:24,452 --> 01:26:25,751
<i>You're wasting time.
The airport!</i>

1426
01:26:44,437 --> 01:26:45,636
General, look!

1427
01:26:46,372 --> 01:26:48,271
Good heavens!

1428
01:27:00,852 --> 01:27:03,752
That's my car. Get the police on the radio.

1429
01:27:06,823 --> 01:27:09,256
Hello, Sequoia...
Turn this thing around!

1430
01:27:33,682 --> 01:27:35,415
Here comes a car.

1431
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,919
It's Wilson.
Yeah, and Link.

1432
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:43,255
And the cat! They're here. They've come!

1433
01:27:43,257 --> 01:27:44,723
Naturally.

1434
01:27:44,725 --> 01:27:47,859
You knew they would.
You knew it. We've won.

1435
01:27:47,861 --> 01:27:49,794
Now they will have turn over the cat.

1436
01:27:49,796 --> 01:27:51,729
And we will turn over the girl.

1437
01:27:51,731 --> 01:27:53,363
We will?

1438
01:27:54,299 --> 01:27:55,965
We won't?

1439
01:27:55,967 --> 01:27:58,767
It might be difficult to explain
your part in this affair.

1440
01:27:58,769 --> 01:28:01,802
After the young lady's gone to the police.

1441
01:28:04,306 --> 01:28:06,272
Dear.

1442
01:28:07,775 --> 01:28:09,740
You wouldn't dare!

1443
01:28:12,845 --> 01:28:14,911
Frank, that must be the chopper.

1444
01:28:19,616 --> 01:28:21,916
It's the police, sir.
It's a trap.

1445
01:28:21,918 --> 01:28:24,785
The fools!
Get us airborne.

1446
01:28:36,898 --> 01:28:38,464
<i>Watch it!</i>

1447
01:28:45,706 --> 01:28:47,672
They're getting away! They're leaving!
Yeah, yeah.

1448
01:28:47,674 --> 01:28:49,594
But look who's arriving.
The army and the police.

1449
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,953
Jake, we have to follow that copter.

1450
01:29:03,955 --> 01:29:06,655
What... What kind of an airport is this?
Where are the planes?

1451
01:29:06,657 --> 01:29:07,956
<i>Follow me.</i>

1452
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:18,398
You can't fly this, Jake. It's a wreck.

1453
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,366
Look at that propeller, it's half gone.

1454
01:29:34,381 --> 01:29:35,747
<i>Are you coming or staying?</i>

1455
01:29:35,749 --> 01:29:36,781
I'm coming.

1456
01:29:36,783 --> 01:29:38,382
I'm staying.

1457
01:30:01,906 --> 01:30:05,374
Okay, <i>Tovarisch.</i>

1458
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:09,510
<i>Quoi?</i>
All right,

1459
01:30:09,512 --> 01:30:11,696
Dr. Garbage Expert.

1460
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,881
Who's your accomplice?
Who's flying that plane?

1461
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:18,484
General, you're not gonna believe this.

1462
01:30:18,986 --> 01:30:20,618
<i>There they are.</i>

1463
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:31,862
It's Wilson and the cat.

1464
01:30:31,864 --> 01:30:33,930
How did they get that wreck in the air?

1465
01:30:33,932 --> 01:30:36,098
The power that cat possesses is awesome.

1466
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,632
You betcha, Charlie,

1467
01:30:37,634 --> 01:30:38,966
And if you know what's good for you,

1468
01:30:38,968 --> 01:30:39,967
You'll land this thing, and let Lucybelle...

1469
01:30:39,969 --> 01:30:41,101
Quiet!
Okay.

1470
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:42,969
Faster, Omar, faster.

1471
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,076
Get close. Use the collar
to force them to land.

1472
01:30:50,078 --> 01:30:52,011
<i>No chance. It's taking all I got.</i>

1473
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,645
<i>Just to keep this crate flying.</i>

1474
01:30:55,915 --> 01:30:57,481
<i>Don't panic. We'll think of something.</i>

1475
01:31:01,487 --> 01:31:04,621
What's happening? Why aren't
they doing something?

1476
01:31:04,623 --> 01:31:07,490
Of course! They're afraid
of harming the girl.

1477
01:31:07,492 --> 01:31:10,159
Turn on them, Omar.
The advantage is ours.

1478
01:31:17,835 --> 01:31:19,635
What's happening? Why are
they turning around?

1479
01:31:20,938 --> 01:31:22,938
Straight at them, Omar.
Drive them down.

1480
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:24,039
Frank!

1481
01:31:26,676 --> 01:31:27,808
Jake!

1482
01:31:35,215 --> 01:31:37,215
Jake. Jake!

1483
01:31:37,217 --> 01:31:39,584
Jake! Jake!

1484
01:31:41,087 --> 01:31:43,787
Jake! Turn this thing over.

1485
01:31:43,989 --> 01:31:45,121
Jake.

1486
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:47,756
Jake.

1487
01:31:52,161 --> 01:31:53,894
Jake. Jake!

1488
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:57,696
Jake. Jake!

1489
01:31:59,766 --> 01:32:00,898
<i>Frank, are you okay?</i>

1490
01:32:09,074 --> 01:32:10,740
What are they trying to do?

1491
01:32:10,742 --> 01:32:12,859
<i>They're trying to force us down.</i>

1492
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,977
<i>They probably figured out
that we've got a problem.</i>

1493
01:32:25,889 --> 01:32:26,889
<i>Hold on!</i>

1494
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,998
Here they come.

1495
01:33:01,722 --> 01:33:03,021
They're still on our tail.

1496
01:33:03,023 --> 01:33:04,222
<i>Don't panic.</i>

1497
01:33:34,886 --> 01:33:37,620
On top of them, Omar.
Smash them down!

1498
01:33:45,295 --> 01:33:47,628
<i>I see 'em. I see 'em.</i>

1499
01:33:48,163 --> 01:33:50,163
Look out. Jake! Jake!

1500
01:33:58,038 --> 01:33:59,937
Here they come again. Jake!

1501
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:00,939
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1502
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:08,344
Fruitcake.
Frank, watch out!

1503
01:34:08,346 --> 01:34:09,978
Jake, Jake!

1504
01:34:27,861 --> 01:34:28,893
<i>Boy.</i>

1505
01:34:32,164 --> 01:34:33,696
Jake.

1506
01:34:43,107 --> 01:34:44,372
Dear.

1507
01:34:54,216 --> 01:34:55,815
Jake!

1508
01:34:57,151 --> 01:34:58,350
Break off!

1509
01:35:13,965 --> 01:35:16,246
Buzz them again, Omar, and this
time, everybody open fire.

1510
01:35:44,824 --> 01:35:46,023
What happened?

1511
01:35:46,025 --> 01:35:47,157
You happened, you imbecile!

1512
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:48,424
How bad is it, Omar?

1513
01:35:48,426 --> 01:35:50,292
He got the controls.
They're locked.

1514
01:35:50,294 --> 01:35:53,295
When the fuel runs out, we're through.
Shall we bail out, sir?

1515
01:35:53,297 --> 01:35:55,764
We have no choice.

1516
01:35:55,766 --> 01:35:56,998
Bail out?

1517
01:36:04,172 --> 01:36:07,406
Where are you going? I
haven't got a parachute.

1518
01:36:07,408 --> 01:36:09,040
Then you have a problem.

1519
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:11,275
I haven't got a parachute, either.

1520
01:36:11,277 --> 01:36:13,277
Then you have the same problem.

1521
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:16,980
Wait! No, wait!
Wait a minute!

1522
01:36:16,982 --> 01:36:18,915
I... I don't
want to die!

1523
01:36:21,019 --> 01:36:22,852
Swell.

1524
01:36:27,024 --> 01:36:28,356
Frank!

1525
01:36:28,891 --> 01:36:30,290
Frank!

1526
01:36:34,328 --> 01:36:37,362
Yes, Mr. President.
Absolutely, Mr. President.

1527
01:36:37,364 --> 01:36:41,065
We're just waiting for them to land and
we'll pass that on, Mr. President.

1528
01:36:41,067 --> 01:36:42,132
Yes, sir.

1529
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:45,735
What'd he say?

1530
01:36:45,736 --> 01:36:48,070
Your friend, Jake is to be treated as
the representative of a friendly power,

1531
01:36:48,072 --> 01:36:49,504
With generous borrowing credit.

1532
01:36:49,506 --> 01:36:52,006
In exchange for bases, of course.

1533
01:36:52,008 --> 01:36:54,374
Look, sir, chutes.
They bailed out.

1534
01:36:57,512 --> 01:37:01,447
Holy mackerel! Who's flying the chopper?

1535
01:37:10,023 --> 01:37:11,355
Frank!

1536
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:30,340
Easy, Liz. Don't panic.

1537
01:37:30,342 --> 01:37:32,108
<i>What are you gonna do, Frank?</i>

1538
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:33,976
I don't know, but I have to do something.

1539
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:12,076
Hand me Lucybelle!

1540
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,025
Careful, Frank!

1541
01:38:29,027 --> 01:38:30,259
I got her.

1542
01:38:36,214 --> 01:38:37,930
<i>Just hold on, honey, and we'll get Liz.</i>

1543
01:38:37,933 --> 01:38:39,966
Get us up closer to the copter.

1544
01:38:39,968 --> 01:38:42,001
<i>Right.</i>

1545
01:38:42,002 --> 01:38:44,035
Liz, when we get close enough, grab my hand.

1546
01:38:51,444 --> 01:38:54,011
Frank, you're too far away!

1547
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:55,579
Closer, Jake. Closer!

1548
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,419
Okay.
All right.

1549
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:05,854
Grab my hand,
liz. Grab it!

1550
01:39:07,023 --> 01:39:08,889
Grab it! Liz, careful.

1551
01:39:11,093 --> 01:39:13,226
Okay.
Now grab my hand.

1552
01:39:13,228 --> 01:39:14,627
Grab my hand.
All right.

1553
01:39:15,963 --> 01:39:17,929
I'm... Yeah.

1554
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:20,531
Good. That's good. That's good.
Now grab my hand and step off.

1555
01:39:20,533 --> 01:39:22,032
Step off?

1556
01:39:22,034 --> 01:39:23,933
Liz!

1557
01:39:25,636 --> 01:39:27,936
Frank, I don't think this is gonna work.

1558
01:39:27,938 --> 01:39:29,938
All right.
We'll try it again.

1559
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,213
Never mind. We'll try
something else.

1560
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,149
All right, put your feet on my shoulders.

1561
01:39:43,151 --> 01:39:44,950
What?

1562
01:39:44,952 --> 01:39:47,886
Put your feet right there, on my shoulders.

1563
01:39:48,355 --> 01:39:50,021
No!

1564
01:39:50,023 --> 01:39:51,455
Liz, do it!

1565
01:40:01,099 --> 01:40:04,033
Okay. Okay.

1566
01:40:07,437 --> 01:40:12,006
<i>You see? Everything's gonna be
okay, Lucybelle. Just relax.</i>

1567
01:40:13,909 --> 01:40:15,308
Jake!

1568
01:40:16,244 --> 01:40:19,011
Jake, what are you doing?

1569
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:21,214
<i>You know, when I saw you up
in that chopper, I just...</i>

1570
01:41:07,825 --> 01:41:10,525
<i>Well, honey, looks like
you're stuck with me.</i>

1571
01:41:34,815 --> 01:41:38,082
Don't just hang there.
Get me out of this.

1572
01:41:38,084 --> 01:41:41,785
Don't worry, Mr. Olympus.
I'll get you loose.

1573
01:41:41,787 --> 01:41:44,087
What are you doing with that?

1574
01:41:44,089 --> 01:41:47,256
Well, fortunately, I never go
anywhere without my swiss army knife.

1575
01:41:47,591 --> 01:41:48,790
Idiot!

1576
01:41:56,799 --> 01:41:58,532
All rise.

1577
01:42:00,202 --> 01:42:01,501
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

1578
01:42:01,503 --> 01:42:03,269
The United States District Court,

1579
01:42:03,271 --> 01:42:05,804
The Honorable Judge Alvin Horsham presiding.

1580
01:42:05,806 --> 01:42:07,405
Please be seated.

1581
01:42:11,878 --> 01:42:14,311
You have made application for citizenship.

1582
01:42:14,313 --> 01:42:15,779
Of the United States of America.

1583
01:42:16,481 --> 01:42:18,481
It is a signal honor,

1584
01:42:18,483 --> 01:42:21,116
Which implies not only rights,

1585
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:23,785
But duties and obligations,

1586
01:42:23,787 --> 01:42:27,121
Bearing arms, serving on juries, voting.

1587
01:42:29,191 --> 01:42:31,491
Who is sponsoring this applicant?

1588
01:42:31,493 --> 01:42:33,659
I am, your honor.

1589
01:42:34,695 --> 01:42:36,327
Does the cat have a name?

1590
01:42:36,329 --> 01:42:38,629
Yes, sir. Zunar-J-5...

1591
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:42,665
Jake, your honor.

1592
01:42:47,338 --> 01:42:49,438
Please stand, Jake.

1593
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:52,840
Repeat after me.

1594
01:42:53,609 --> 01:42:54,841
I, Jake...

1595
01:42:54,843 --> 01:42:56,442
<i>I, Jake...</i>

1596
01:42:58,212 --> 01:43:00,412
Pledge allegiance to the flag.

1597
01:43:00,414 --> 01:43:02,347
Of the United States of America.

1598
01:43:02,349 --> 01:43:04,065
<i>Pledge allegiance to the flag.</i>

01:43:04,066 --> 01:43:05,782
<i>Of the United States of America...</i>

1600
01:43:05,785 --> 01:43:09,186
And to the republic for which it stands...

1601
01:43:09,188 --> 01:43:12,923
<i>And to the republic for which it stands...</i>

1602
01:43:12,925 --> 01:43:18,461
One nation, under god, indivisible...

1603
01:43:18,463 --> 01:43:21,697
<i>One nation, under god, indivisible...</i>

1604
01:43:21,699 --> 01:43:23,699
With liberty and justice for all.

1605
01:43:23,701 --> 01:43:25,867
<i>With liberty and justice for all.</i>
