Ooh! Ooh!

00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:46,623 
Wait for me!

10
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,275 
Hold the boat!

11
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,311 
I'm coming!

12
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,066 
Noah! Mr. The ark,
I'm here.

13
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:59,335 
Oh, barely made it.
For a minute,
I thought you'd leave without...

14
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:04,791 
Oh, oh.
Gee, Mr. Noah... Sir.

15
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,643 
I'm gonna come too.

16
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,263 
What are you anyway?

17
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,448 
Oh. Good question.

18
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:17,353 
Technically speaking,
let's say,
put me down as a "whatever."

19
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:20,740 
What do you mean?
What is your species?

20
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:23,526 
Well, I-I...

21
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:26,930 
I don't know.
I guess there's only one of me.

22
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,868 
Then you are doomed!

Oh.

[door opens]
huh?

26
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:44,313 
Um...
yes, sir?

27
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,350 
You may need this.

28
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,853 
But, but, but...

29
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,088 
But?

30
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,408 
Ooh!

31
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,148 
Oh... No!

32
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,150 
No!

33
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,886 
No, no, no!

34
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,455 
I don't wanna be alone!

35
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,192 
No!

no, no.

37
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:19,398 
No, I don't wanna be alone.
No, no.

- No!
- [screams]

39
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,637 
I don't wanna be alone!

40
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,540 
You're not alone.
Who said that?

41
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:32,212 
Gee, I don't know.
Maybe it's the rat who's
hanging out of the window!

42
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:39,585 
- Rizzo?
- No, it's Santa.
But I forgot my reindeer.

43
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,255 
I'm sorry, Rizzo.
Yeah, right.

44
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:47,060 
Ah, boy.
I had that
weird dream again.

45
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:51,197 
Oh, yeah? The one
with the goat, the dwarf
and the jar of peanut butter?

46
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:55,534 
No, it was the one where...
ah, forget about it.
You wouldn't understand.

47
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,204 
I'd understand!
Come on, we're roommates.

48
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:02,909 
Hey... Hey, hey.
I'm here for you, man.

49
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:06,379 
Well, okay. It's the one
where I'm talking
to this Noah guy.

50
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,082 
And he won't let me
on his boat
because I'm all...

[snoring]

52
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,622 
Alone.

53
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,659

Suck in those tummies,
ladies.

Good morning, Rowlf.
Good morning.

Good morning, everyone.
Good morning, Kermit.

96
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,642 
Hello, little people!

97
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,846 
What an absolutely
splendid day!

98
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:34,087 
How are you this morning?
Oh, late! I start
my fabulous new job today.

99
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,556 
We megastar TV journalists
have to be punctual, you know.

100
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:42,494

run. Bye, Kermie. Kissie, kissie.

Is breakfast over?
No. Why?

103
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:53,172 
'cause I think the bacon
just ran out.
[laughing]

104
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,943 
The raspberry flapovers
will be out in a moment.

105
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,479 
Hey, uncle Kermit,
what are you gonna do now
that you're on vacation?

106
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,482 
Robin, as soon as I get
those housepainters started,

107
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,152 
I'm going to kick back
and relax.
Kermit?

108
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,921 
When will you fix the oven?
What's wrong
with the oven?

109
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,359 
- [explosion]
- that.

Yurski burski

00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,099 
I'll put it
on the top of my list.

112
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,201 
There is a menu correction,
okay?

113
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,837 
We will now be serving
bologna sandwiches.

- I'm already gone.

00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:39,986 
Gonzo, aren't you performing
at that bar mitzvah today?

117
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,155 
Nah. The electric mayhem's
covering for me.

118
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,056 
Shalom!

119
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,494 
[grunting]
oy!

120
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:53,365 
But you never miss the Chance
to shoot yourself out
of a cannon. Something wrong?

121
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,035 
Nah.
Okay.

122
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:00,339 
It's just that I'm sick
and tired of being
a one-of-a-kind freak.

123
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:04,811 
Gonzo, you are not
a one-of-a-kind freak.
You're a...

124
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,880 
A...
a whatever?

125
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,382 
Well... Yeah.
You see?

126
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,520 
You see what I mean?
I don't even know where
I came from or who I am.

127
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:18,757 
Yo, Kerm.
You weren't waiting for
some housepainters, were you?

128
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,693 
Yeah.
They're just driving away.

129
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,329 
- What?
- Animal bit one of 'em.

130
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,732 
Oh, no! Wait, guys!

131
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,801 
Don't let 'em go!

132
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,771 
You know what you are,
Gonzo?

133
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,606 
What?

134
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,176 
Distinct.
[car engine revving]

135
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,046

He's just a musician.

"watch the Sky"?

00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,515 
Hey! Hey!

141
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:37,620 
Rizzo, come here.
I think my Kap'n Alphabet
is sending me a message.

142
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:41,557 
I know what you mean.
I had some guacamole and
it's still speaking to me.

143
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,926 
No, no, really!
Look, look.
I'm not kidding.

144
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:50,666 
It was there just a second ago.
I swear, Rizzo.
It said, "watch the Sky."

145
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:55,270 
Are you sure it didn't say
"you need help"?

146
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,940 
But, but...

147
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,676 
Maybe you and your cereal
would like to be alone.

148
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,046

Huh.

Over the past few months,

167

We have received
some unusual communications.

00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,791 
Sorry about that, general.
Here you go.
Here's your remote.

170
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,360 
Thank you, Rentro.

171
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,697 
[singer]
we believe that aliens
are using a contact on Earth...

172
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,700 
To plan their invasion.

173
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,703 
This same message,
"are you there,"

174
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,239 
Has appeared
all over the world.

175
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,078 
We've been lucky enough
to capture these instances
on film.

176
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:02,248 
The Pyramid at Giza.

177
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,119 
Stonehenge.

178
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:11,090 
Okay, this one says...

179
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:15,094 
"are you three,"
but we believe that to be
a simple spelling error.

180
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,730 
This could be vandalism,
a practical joke.

181
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,334 
Now, you see that?
That's what I said, general.

182
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,969 
These photos are...

183
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,441 
I'll just
be over here then.
Right this way, general.

184
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:33,679 
When I plotted these anomalies
sequentially,
a pattern emerged.

185
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,782 
A spiral.

186
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:41,020 
Do you see the spiral?

187
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:45,090 
Sir, they are out there.
They are coming here.

188
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,061 
Do you have any idea
what you have here?

189
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,997 
Well, sir,
I have an inkling.
Bubkes!

190
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,633 
"bubkes"?
Good day.

191
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,269 
But, sir,
we have to take action now.

192
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:00,173 
Singer, I hired you
to find me an alien.

193
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,510 
And you bring me
doctored photos
and a spiral.

194
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:07,980 
You are on thin ice, boy.

195
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:16,689 
I gotta hand it to you.
I thought your presentation
was just wonderful.

196
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,627 
And... hmm.

197
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,696 
Yeah.

198
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,733 
Oop, there it is.

199
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,306 
Roberta. Dolores.
No.

200
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,410 
Whoo!
Shannanay!
[chuckles]

201
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,778 
Yo, Kerm,
what should I do
with the bills?

202
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:43,449 
Just leave 'em inside.
All right.

203
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,552 
Gonzo, do you want
your new issue
of insanity fair?

204
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,922 
[Gonzo]
nah, I'll get it later.

205
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,263 
[dog barking]

206
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,285 
[clock chiming]
what is he doing up there?

207
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:05,754 
His breakfast cereal
told him to sit on the roof.

208
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,492 
Ooh! Talk about
whole grain and nuts!

209
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,240 
Cool!

210
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,346 
Aah!

211
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:38,854 
Whoa!

212
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,893 
Hey, hey. Yeah!

213
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,796 
# when you wish
upon a star #

214
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,798 
Cool!

215
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:54,136 
# your dreams will take you
very far, yeah #
[imitates motor revving]

216
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,740 
# when you wish upon a dream #
[laughing]

217
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,976 
# life ain't always
what it seems, oh yeah #

218
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,914 
# shining star #
whoa!

219
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:08,551 
This could be painful!

220
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:12,271 
[laughing]
it is! It is!

221
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,740 
Gonzo! Gonzo!

222
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,576 
Look at Gonzo!

223
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,179 
[together]
greetings, Mr. Gonzo!
Greetings!

224
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,682 
What are you guys?
Space fish?

225
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,918 
We are cosmic
knowledge fish.
We know many, many things.

226
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,721 
Would you like some tea?
No, thanks.

227
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:32,425 
Mr. Gonzo, your people
have been trying
to reach you.

228
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,460 
My people?
Are they fish too?

229
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,462 
[together]
no, no, no, no.

230
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,133 
We are not the same as you.
We are highly
evolved beings.

231
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:45,438 
Now, if...
what was I saying?
My people.

232
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,140 
Oh, yes!
Excellent!

233
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,943 
You must mow the lawn
if you wish
to find what you seek.

234
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,412 
I should mow the lawn?
Mmm.

235
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,015 
A lawn that is cut
in your own words, Gonzo.

236
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,586 
A message that
can be seen from space.
So trim it well.

237
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:04,623 
Good-bye, Gonzo.
And may the fish be with you.

238
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,393 
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for
the cosmic knowledge.

239
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,395 
Good-bye, Mr. Gonzo.

240
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,497 
# what your life
can truly be #

241
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:14,649 
Aah!

242
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:20,255 
[grunting]

243
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:23,725 
[laughing]

244
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:30,632 
That's it!

245
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,935 
Come on, Rizzo.
It's time to bet, okay.

246
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:37,672 
All right, prawn cracker.
I'll see your
Maryland crab cakes...

247
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,345 
And I'll raise you
a 1958 cheddar cheese,
never been sniffed!

248
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:46,581 
Crab cakes and cheese,
huh?
Can't beat that.

249
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,619 
Hey, guys!
The cosmic fish
have spoken to me.

250
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:54,689 
I'm from outer space!
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's great.

251
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:57,126 
[Rizzo]
Pepe, are you in or out?
Si, I'm in.

252
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:00,396 
I'm an alien!
Have you been tap dancing
on the barbecue again?

253
00:18:00,463 --> 00:18:03,450 
No, no, Rizzo.
I'm just fine.
[screaming]

254
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,620 
Whoa! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
My cards!

255
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,939 
Somebody get
a fire extinguisher.
Not my cards!

256
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,208 
Oh, no, no!

257
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:16,411 
Gonzo, are you sure you're okay?

258
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,847 
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
But I have to respond.

259
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:22,084 
Gotta make contact!
Ah!

260
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:26,021 
- Where's he going
with those keys?
- Who cares? Flying saucer.

261
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:30,458 
Dos deuces.
The prawn cracker wins.

262
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,361 
Pair of twos!
I swear, I had four aces!

263
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,067 
I really did!
# you got to know
when to hold it #

264
00:18:38,134 --> 00:18:41,269 
No, no, no!
# know when to fold it
know when to... #

265
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:44,073 
- [lawn mower engine starting]
- [Gonzo] yeow!

266
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,077 
# get up off of that thing
dance and you'll feel better #

267
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:52,614 
# get up off of that thing
and dance, sing it now #

268
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:55,450 
# get up off of that thing
dance and you'll feel better #

269
00:18:55,752 --> 00:19:00,439 
# get up off of that thing
and try to release
that pressure #

270
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:04,276 
# get up off of that thing
shake and you'll feel better #

271
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:09,014 
# get up off of that thing
and shake
say it now #

272
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:12,451 
# get up off of that thing
and try to release
that pressure #

273
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:16,254 
# wait a minute
hold it #

274
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:20,058 
[Rentro]
well, just a few things for today, sir.

275
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,345 
Let's see.
Oh, here's a winner.

276
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,715 
Your platinum buns
workout tape.

277
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,250 
[laughing]

278
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:31,820 
And let's see.
That new satellite photo
is here.

279
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:36,091 
My Captain Kangaroo pajamas.
What? What satellite photo?

280
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,060 
Huh?

281
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,099 
"I am here"...

282
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,368 
Mowed in the lawn.

283
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,238 
Who did this?

284
00:19:56,479 --> 00:20:00,816 
This is not good.
No.

285
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:04,603 
Poor Guy!
He's hallucinatin'.
Gettin' weird messages.

286
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,473 
Hearing things.
He listens to voices
and does what they say.

287
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,743 
Hold your horses.
What?

288
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,647 
I think
I've got an idea.
You're scary.

289
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:20,619 
Okay. Yeah.
I have to call Luft.
Ooh!

290
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,289 
- Wait. Careful.
- Careful.

291
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,158 
Baby steps.
Baby steps.

292
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:30,029 
- We need more evidence.
- More evidence!

293
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,497 
Remember.
We're just watching.
Watching.

294
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,866 
And waiting.
Waiting.

295
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,305 
[snoring]

296
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,242 
[Pepe]
build it and we will come!

297
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,710 
Build what?

298
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,782 
Build a jacuzzi
and we will come, okay.

299
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,018 
[laughing]
shh.

300
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,087 
I'm up. I'm up.

301
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,623 
[grunts]

302
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,561 
Must build jacuzzi.

303
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,563 
[laughing]
well done, pal.

304
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,132 
Gracias, amigo.

305
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,935 
[music, laughter,
chattering]

306
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,572 
Put a little more paprika
on those, okay? Thank you.

307
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,707 
Well, that's everything.

308
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,943 
[laughing]
whoa!

309
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:21,546 
He built it.
And we came.

310
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,250 
All right, remember.
I built this new jacuzzi
for my alien family,

311
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,252 
So please
no eating in the spa.

312
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,357 
We gotta tell him
the truth, Pepe.

313
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:34,693 
You tell him,
and I will smack you.

314
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,529 
I will smack you
like a bad, bad donkey,
okay.

315
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,932 
Sal.
Yeah, Johnny.

316
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:45,437 
There are no cannolis here.
Yeah, but have you tried
this cake? This is a beauty.

317
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,939 
That is nice!
Would you...
Gonzo, Gonzo!

318
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:51,143 
Hey, go easy on the buffet,
fellas. I just want...

319
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:54,213 
Who cut the cake?
Who cut the cake!
What?

320
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,748 
Who cut it?
I don't believe that!

321
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,751 
Who cut this cake?
Who would've...
that's awful.

322
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,155 
I can't believe it.
The guests of honor
aren't even here yet.

323
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:05,157 
Hey, great party!
Yeah.

324
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:08,093 
I just wish
they'd get here.

325
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,130 
[Sal]
hey, you, did you cut
Gonzo's cake?

326
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:14,633 
[Waldorf]
I wonder if there really
is life on other planets.

327
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:18,137 
What do you care?
You don't have a life
on this planet.

328
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,840 
[laughing]
[laughing,
groaning]

329
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:24,293 
[TV announcer]
Earth, are you ready?
The galaxy channel presents...

330
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,563 
U.F.O. Mania live,
with close encounter expert Shelley Snipes.

331
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:31,033 
Hello, I'm Shelley Snipes.

332
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,501 
Coming up
on UFO Mania live,

333
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:37,205 
I'll be taking a hard look
at some compelling new data.

334
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,909 
Have you seen something in the Sky,
but were afraid to talk about it?

335
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:44,813 
[Gonzo]
I don't understand why
they didn't show up last night.

336
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,149 
Perhaps we can be
of assistance.

337
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:49,784 
We can help you contact
your alien brethren...

338
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:52,821 
By boosting your
newly-enhanced conductivity.

339
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,823 
[Bunsen]
okay, Beakie, let her rip!

340
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,344 
Me-me-ee.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

341
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:02,280 
Wait a minute.
I think I'm picking up
a signal.

342
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,382 
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

343
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,352 
[Snipes]
if you have had contact
with an alien...

344
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,822 
Or if you are an alien
and want to tell your story,

345
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,057 
Write to us
or come to our studio.

346
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:16,261 
[Snipes over speaker]
...Or come to our studio
at 6577 broadcast Lane now.

347
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:19,698 
The mother ship
is calling me home!

348
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,968 
[gasps]
[laughing]
thanks, guys.

349
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:25,938 
Oh, the mother ship!
It worked.
The mother ship.

350
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:29,541 
[laughing]
good, good, good.
Beaker?

351
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,543 
You said you were going
to tell him.

352
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:35,914 
Pepe, the jacuzzi thing
was your idea,
and you have to tell him.

353
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:38,383 
Si.
I will tell him.
Right. Here he comes.

354
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,385 
They are
calling me!
Hey, Gonzo...

355
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,687 
I can't talk now.

356
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:45,958 
You should've told him.
I wasn't supposed to.
You were!

357
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,761 
You said you would.
When I said "you,"
I meant you.

358
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,400 
# so funky #

359
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:59,638 
# yo, what's up
get up off of that thing #

360
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,373 
# and dance
and you'll feel better #

361
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,744 
# get up off of that thing
and try to release
that pressure #

362
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,814 
Hi, guys.
I'm here.

363
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:12,350 
Just leave the tractor
here in front, okay?

364
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,369 
And that's the way it is.

365
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:18,507 
This is Miss Piggy
saying good night
and have a great...

366
00:24:18,574 --> 00:24:21,443 
[Sandy]
where's my coffee?

367
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:25,046 
I-I'm coming!
Coming!

368
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:27,916 
Coming! Coming!

369
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:30,351 
Hey, Piggy,
I'll take one.

370
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,788 
In a minute.
Light, no sugar.

371
00:24:32,855 --> 00:24:35,624 
Shelley's stuck at the airport.
She'll never
make it back on time.

372
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,727 
Okay, I am not
gonna panic.

373
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:41,963 
Who am I kidding?
Yes, I am!
No. No, I'm not.

374
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:46,267 
Okay, I'm panicking.
Who can we possibly get
at the last minute?

375
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:48,336 
[Miss Piggy grunting]

376
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,139 
Cappuccino?

377
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:54,125 
[woman]
stand by, everybody.
Roll tape please.

378
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:56,127 
And cue I.D.

379
00:24:56,196 --> 00:25:00,765 
We're on in five, four, three, two...

380
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,239 
[gasping]

381
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:09,575 
Look!
It's Piggy's new show.

382
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,277 
Ahh...

383
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,813 
Read! Read!

384
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,752 
Oh, oh, oh!
"hello again.
I'm Shelley Snipes.

385
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:28,126 
Today on UFO Mania: Flying saucers
and their extraterrestrial pilots."

386
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,562 
Hmm. Wish I could find
my pants.

387
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,264 
[Pepe]
Kermit, you should come
to see this.

388
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:34,633 
"I'm sure
you've often wondered...

389
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,736 
Piggy!
What might those
alien creatures look like."

390
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,939 
People of Earth,
do not be alarmed.

391
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,224 
My message will be brief.

392
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,193 
I am Gonzo.

393
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,195 
Gonzo! Hmph!
Piggy?

394
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:49,848 
I don't have a Gonzo.

395
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:54,719 
- There seems to be
some sort of mistake.
- Better get down there, Kerm.

396
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:57,555 
Relax. No one is
going anywhere, okay?

397
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,708 
You see, I was contacted
through my breakfast cereal,

398
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:05,464 
And later it was confirmed to me
by the cosmic fish
that I am from outer space.

399
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:10,935 
So you wanna go now
or wait for the commercial?

400
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,572 
Now.
Come on.

401
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,576 
What are you doing here?
I'm making contact.
What are you doing?

402
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,911 
- Um...
- interview him.

403
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:23,214 
I'm interviewing...
I'm interviewing you!

404
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:26,351 
[Gonzo]
great!
What would you like to know?

405
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:30,689 
The whole tearful tale
of your inner struggle, Gonzo.
Oh.

406
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,825 
[Gonzo] I want my people to know
that I've received their messages.

407
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:37,028 
And my response to them is: I am here!

408
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,765 
"I am here."

409
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:44,169 
Bingo!

410
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:48,807 
I'm at 44 Bronson Lane,
and I can't wait
to meet you.

411
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:51,826 
And I can't wait
to meet you.

412
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:55,363 
Me too. He's very charismatic,
don't you think?
Freeze that!

413
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:59,434 
[singer] I want him here
and I want him now.
[Rentro] yes, sir.

414
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:04,372 
So, you're our fancy
little landscaper.

415
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,076 
- Wrap it up.
We're gonna take a break.
- Oh, oh, yes. [chuckles]

416
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:12,931 
We are going to pause here,
and be right back with Gonzo,
the geek who fell to Earth,

417
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:16,001 
With moi, Miss Piggy.
And we're out.

418
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,553 
Ninety seconds, folks.
[groans]

419
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:21,890 
Now that is TV!
The phones are lighting up
like Vegas.

420
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:25,393 
What power! What heat.
You're a hit!
Oh, thank you!

421
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:28,096 
- Not you! Him.
- Me?

422
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:30,765 
- Gonzo, you've got it.
- Sure wish we could find
a cure for it.

423
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,401 
- Rizzo?
- Gonzo?

424
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:34,736 
- Kermie?
- Piggy?

425
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:36,838 
What the heck's goin' on?
[Kermit] listen, Gonzo.

426
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,741 
Aren't you taking
this alien thing
a little too far?

427
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:44,813 
Kermit, I realize it may
be hard for you to accept me
as an alien,

428
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,815 
But I didn't choose
to be one.

429
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:52,153 
I've always had alien
tendencies, and this
just makes sense to me.

430
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:55,456 
Beautiful, big "g."
I see a whole follow-up episode.

431
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:59,694 
Me too!
"the alien in my life."
a Miss Piggy special report.

432
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:02,697 
- What are you talkin' about?
You're the coffee pig.
- Huh?

433
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,367 
Here's how we see it.
Kermit,
he's such a joker!

434
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,554 
We'll take this
from here.

435
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:14,692 
We're with the society for the
prevention of cruelty to aliens.
We feel your pain, Gonzo.

436
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,829 
They feel my pain!
I've got a paper cut
that's a doozy.

437
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,365 
Do you feel my pain too?

438
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,601 
Can you guys help me
make contact
with my alien tribe?

439
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,485 
Yes, we can, Gonzo.

440
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:27,288 
Well, somebody believes me.
Come on, fellas.

441
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:29,824 
Take me to my leader.
But, but, Gonzo!

442
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:33,361 
I don't like the look
of these guys.
This rat smells a rat.

443
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:35,463 
The limo's
right this way.
Thank you.

444
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:38,533 
Did he say "limo"?
Wait a second,
I'm his translator.

445
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,704 
Now wait.
You know this Gonzo, right?
Um...

446
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:46,107 
- If the price is right.
- The price?

447
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:50,145 
Look.
I deliver Gonzo's
exclusive live story, okay,

448
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:53,381 
If you make moi
your new anchorwoman.

449
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:56,151 
[woman]
we're back in 15 seconds.
Well?

450
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:59,054 
What about Shelley?
Shelley's smelly.

451
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:02,023 
Yes, yes!
Go!
All right!

452
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:06,561 
Oh! Excuse me.

453
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,299 
Excuse me.
Hoo-hoo.
Studmuffin, hold it.

454
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,601 
I'll deal with her.
Yeah, come on.

455
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,871 
[laughing]
oh, you'll deal with moi!

456
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:19,240 
Look, chumpo,
I'm just trying
to get a story.

457
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:21,409 
How 'bout this story?

458
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:23,712 
It's about a big, bad wolf
and a little pig.

459
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,315 
- No, that's three pigs.
- Not in this version.

460
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:29,884 
Hey, wait a minute.

461
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:32,520 
You're not part of that
alien protection agency.

462
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:36,157 
Who are you?
Where are you taking Gonzo?
Hey!

463
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:38,559 
Hai-ya!

464
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:41,929 
I'm impressed.
Ahh.

465
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,901 
Black belt,
third degree.

466
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:49,036 
Hai-ya!

467
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:52,240 
Platinum belt... With
an unlimited line of credit.

468
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:55,877 
I like this party.
Oh!

469
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:59,714 
Tough Guy! Tough Guy!
Ha, ha!

470
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:02,968 
Come on, show me!
Oh, look, Cindy Crawford!
Huh?

471
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,905 
[groans, laughs]

472
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,808 
Where have you been
all my life?

473
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,880 
Is that all you got?

474
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,982 
Is that all you got?

475
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,886 
Is that all you got?
Is that all you g-got?

476
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:24,322 
Not the noogie!

477
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,058 
Hey!
[groans]

478
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:33,464 
[yelling]
mama!

479
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:36,234 
[crowd chanting]
Gonzo! Gonzo!

480
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:40,038 
What the hey?

481
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,290 
Oh, no.

482
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:45,159 
There are no aliens here.

483
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:48,029 
Only good, old-fashioned,
hard-working Americans.
[clucking]

484
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,164 
Good grief.

485
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:52,617 
Now, get off
my Kentucky bluegrass.

486
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,987 
Look!
It's a little green man.

487
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:59,857 
Ah, excuse me.
But what are all you people
doing here?

488
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:03,562 
We were drawn here
by the alien.

489
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,500 
Yuck!

490
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,102 
That's all I know.
Let me get
this straight.

491
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,640 
This government agency,
C.O.V.N.E.T.,
has abducted Gonzo,

492
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,176 
And taken him
to its top secret facility?

493
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,178 
Yes, Miss Piggy.

494
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:22,614 
Thank you, darling.
You've been most helpful.

495
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:25,717 
At last!
A real story!

496
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:28,553 
Intrigue, danger,
new outfits.

497
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:31,789 
And it's mine, mine, mine!
All mine!
[laughing]

498
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,391 
[grunting]

499
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:37,095 
Ah, come on, please.
You think Ted Koppel
never gets excited?

500
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:42,200 
[Rizzo]
so this is the car that
takes us to the limo, right?

501
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,803 
[Rizzo grunts]
you should have somebody
look at those shocks.

502
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:49,140 
At least they carried our stuff.
Don't hold your breath
for a tip.

503
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,576 
[Rizzo]
oh!

504
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:56,314 
As ambassador of Earth,

505
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,683 
I welcome you.

506
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:02,520 
Ah, yeah.

507
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:07,191 
I'm Edgar.
But I want you
to call me ed.

508
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,928 
That's ed.
Oh, yeah.

509
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:12,430 
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Gonzo.

510
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,265 
Yeah, yeah, me too.

511
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,268 
Hors d'oeuvres!
[laughing]
please.

512
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:20,605 
Won't you sit?

513
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,040 
Oh! Thanks.

514
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:26,044 
Careful, careful.
You'll get gas.
Hmm?

515
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,614 
So when do we begin, ed?
I'm very excited about all this.

516
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:32,784 
Ah!
Me too, my friend.

517
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:36,688 
Me too.
Yeah!

518
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:39,457 
Kermie!
Oh, Kermie, Kermie!

519
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:40,992 
Kermie!

520
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,694 
Yes!
Yoo-hoo!

521
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:45,463 
Kermie! Everybody!
Come here, come here!

522
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:49,500 
Oh, oh, oh!
Listen, everyone, listen.
I've got great news!

523
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:52,170 
Gonzo has been kidnapped
by the government,

524
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,939 
And it could be a
life-threatening situation.

525
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,976 
How can that
be great news?
Because...

526
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:02,881 
# I've got the story
I've got the story #

527
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:07,351 
Oh, I need to change!
Something that says
"journalistic integrity."

528
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,821 
Oh, oh,
I've got to pee!

529
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:11,890 
Oh, brother.

530
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:15,927 
What are we gonna do?
Okay, guys,
it's up to us.

531
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:19,397 
We have to save Gonzo
from a whole army
of government agents.

532
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,399 
Well, I have
a joke book.

533
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,334 
Drumsticks!
Drumsticks!

534
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:26,637 
I have some
loose jell-o, okay.

535
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:29,007 
Okay.
Well, that settles that.

536
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:33,511 
In circumstances like this,
there's only one place
to turn.

537
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:39,951 
Okay, what
do you got, Bunsen?
Oh, there you are.

538
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,688 
Mr. Kermit, here at Muppet Labs,
we have come up with
a number of devices...

539
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:47,592 
That should aid you
in your covert operations.
Excellent.

540
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:53,197 
This seemingly ordinary
rubber ducky actually
contains invisibility spray.

541
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:56,868 
However the effect
is sadly temporary.
[mumbles] sadly temporary.

542
00:33:56,935 --> 00:34:00,304 
Ha, ha! The old
rubber-ducky-with-invisibility
spray trick. Check.

543
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:04,776 
And, beaker, if you would.
Here is something
we're very excited about.

544
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,211 
Me-me!
"door in a jar"?

545
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,481 
Me-me-me-me.
Whoo.

546
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,616 
That's absolutely right,
Beakie.

547
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:16,320 
All you do is open the jar,
fling the contents
onto the wall... And poof!

548
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,823 
- Poof!
- Instant door.

549
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:23,027 
What is this?
A secret communication device?

550
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:25,563 
No, that's scotch tape.
Very useful
if something tears.

551
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,465 
Ahh!

552
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,634 
[Miss Piggy]
ahem.

553
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:34,739 
Um, what do you have
for... Moi?

554
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:36,374 
Ahh!

555
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,676 
[Bunsen]
well now, Miss Piggy.

556
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,880 
For you we have
Muppet Labs mind mist.

557
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,882 
Simply spray it on
the subject,

558
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,851 
And they will obey
your every command.

559
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,388 
[laughing]
I... aah!

560
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,757 
Me-me-oo-oo.

561
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:54,091 
Oh.

562
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,361 
I doubt I'll need any.

563
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,714 
- Okay, guys,
let's go get Gonzo.
- Come on, come on.

564
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:03,184 
[Pepe]
we'll find him, okay.
Gonzo, Gonzo, Gonzo!

565
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:04,752 
Yeah!

566
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:12,043 
I've been looking
for something like you...

567
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,045 
All my life.

568
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,681 
And now, at last,
my search...

569
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:19,984 
Has come to an end.

570
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:23,120 
May I?

571
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:28,626 
Before you answer that,
you better be clear on the final
destination of that finger.

572
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,368 
Ahh.
Thanks.

573
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,875 
Hmm.

574
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,712 
No nostrils.

575
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,214 
How do you smell?

576
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:52,817 
Awful.
Trust me,
I'm his roommate.

577
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,819 
[laughing]
huh? Huh?

578
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:57,589 
That's a killer.
[everyone laughing]

579
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,658 
[laughing]

580
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,627 
Don't...

581
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:06,898 
Laugh at me!

582
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:08,733 
[gulps]

583
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:17,108 
I hope I'm not imposing.

584
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,111 
I thought you were great
on TV. Think I could get
your autograph?

585
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,446 
- Rentro?
- Yes, sir?

586
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:27,519 
- It's not a good time.
- This is probably not
a good time. Yeah.

587
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:31,188 
Forgive me
my Earthly manners.

588
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:36,260 
But do you have any idea
what it's like...

589
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:39,263 
To be laughed at?
Yeah, sure I do.

590
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,500 
To be called names
like "wacko"?
Uh-huh.

591
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,802 
- And "freak boy"?
- Oh, yeah.

592
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,806 
- And paranoid
delusional psychopath?
- Got me there.

593
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,808 
To feel...
[neck cracking]

594
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:54,779 
Completely alone
in this world?

595
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:58,917 
Yeah, I think we're starting
to get the general idea, ed.

596
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:02,887 
Yeah.

597
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:12,579 
It's wrestling legend
Hollywood Hulk Hogan?

598
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:17,084 
Have the rat sent down
to Dr. Tucker for some tests.

599
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,021 
Tests? But I Haven't studied.
I don't even have
a number-two pencil.

600
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:23,557 
This is for all my
N.W.O.-ites out there.

601
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,860 
I will continue
to dominate wrestling.

602
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:29,430 
I will continue to make
your back crack, your knees
freeze and your liver quiver.

603
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,935 
I will continue to put
so much pain on you,
you'll be come my "painiac."

604
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:38,005 
Hollywood, would you mind?
The rat.

605
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:43,010 
- Oh, yeah.
- Where're you goin'
with my friend?

606
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:47,581 
What are your fans gonna think?
What are you gonna do?
I'm a bad guy now.

607
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:51,552 
Gonzo, help me!
Help! Help!

608
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,087 
Rizzo!

609
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:55,522 
Shh, shh, shh.

610
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,925 
He's gonna be fine.

611
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,379 
[Rizzo screaming]

612
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,319 
- Huh?
- [groaning]

613
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:11,589 
Yo.

614
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,530 
How you doin'?
I'm bubba.

615
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,400 
Hey. Rizzo.
Nice to meet ya.

616
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:26,871 
Nice to meet you. How'd you like
to meet some of the boys? Sure.

617
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:30,074 
- Up there, that's fast Eddie,
harmonica extraordinaire.
- Hi.

618
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,176 
- How you doin', ed?
- Well, I ain't dead.

619
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:36,514 
Over here's Troy.
This back here, that's shakes.

620
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,384 
Hi. Hello.
How're you doin'?
Welcome.

621
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:42,353 
They're doing a new
caffeine substitute on him.

622
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:46,190 
- Up there's the birdman.
- Where are you?
Gladys, here, baby, sweetie.

623
00:38:46,258 --> 00:38:49,593 
He don't bother nobody.
He's been here forever.

624
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,530 
Gladys,
the guys are watching.

625
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,466 
He just likes to hang out
with his birds.
You know what I mean?

626
00:38:55,534 --> 00:39:00,571 
So, that about does it
for all of us here
at medical research.

627
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,573 
Medical research?
Yep.

628
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:07,078 
But that would mean
that we're... Lab rats!

629
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:10,982 
Gonzo, get me
outta here!

630
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,552 
[singer]
now, Mr. Gonzo.

631
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:18,089 
What can you tell me
about these?

632
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:21,793 
Whoa! They really
have been looking for me!

633
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,262 
And they are coming to Earth,
aren't they?
I don't know.

634
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,431 
How many of them are there?
I don't know.

635
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,734 
When will they be here?

636
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:33,404 
And don't you dare tell me...

637
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,273 
That you don't know.

638
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,976 
I know not?

639
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,414 
[gagging]

640
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:47,251 
But maybe
I could find out?
Could you?

641
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:51,089 
Okay.
Well.

642
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:55,559 
Okay then.
I'll keep in touch.
Thanks.

643
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,764 
Oh. So,
back to the limo?

644
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,935 
It's a shame, really.
Huh?

645
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,638 
I really need
that information.

646
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:10,608 
So, I am afraid...

647
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:15,079 
We're gonna have to perform
an invasive quadra-lobal
brain probe on you,

648
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:17,548 
And pluck it
from your head.

649
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,850 
The information?
No.

650
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,120 
Your brain.
Take him away.
What?

651
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:25,889 
My brain?
But just a second.
I...

652
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:30,628 
Rentro, get me general Luft.
Where're you taking me?
I need my brain!

653
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:39,437 
Fozzie, tell me again.
Why are we doing this?
To save Gonzo.

654
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:43,608 
Gonzo! Gonzo!
That's right, because
Gonzo's one of us.

655
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:47,178 
And no matter what happens,
no matter what obstacles
we face,

656
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:49,180 
We never forget one
of our own.

657
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:51,182 
I love it
when you take charge.

658
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,187 
Hey! We left Bunsen
and beaker back
at the gas station.

659
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:59,923 
Okay, from this point on,
no matter what happens,

660
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,661 
We never forget
one of our own.
Mmm, that's right.

661
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:08,015 
Hmm.

662
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:10,051 
Cheese twiddle?

663
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:13,171 
So what is this,
movie time?

664
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:14,839 
[gasping]

665
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:17,508 
So you're the new guy.

666
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:19,493 
Yeah.
From this moment on,

667
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:23,397 
If I say you're hungry, you eat;
if I say you're sleepy...

668
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:24,765 
I eat?

669
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:28,102 
Ah, you shouldn't have...
what?

670
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,439 
Well, well, well.
We got a funny boy here.

671
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:33,941 
Is that bad?
Very bad.

672
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,876 
Funny boy's gonna go
to the maze.

673
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:41,648 
Since we don't want funny boy
to get lonely, you're all
gonna do time in the maze.

674
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,150 
I'm sorry.

675
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:47,421 
See, no one's ever escaped
from the maze, funny boy.
No?

676
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:49,823 
And even if you did,
it's four feet to the ground,

677
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:53,227 
Twelve feet to the door,
and four feet to the doorknob.

678
00:41:53,295 --> 00:41:55,563 
That's 18 feet.
Twenty.

679
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,133 
Funny thing about doorknobs...
rats can't turn 'em.

680
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:02,002 
No opposable thumb.
[laughs]

681
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:05,672 
Right.
Not the maze.

682
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:13,464 
# help me, help me
help me, hold me #

683
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,636 
# survival #

684
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,772 
# survival of the fittest #

685
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,908 
# survival #
this is ridiculous.

686
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:25,809 
# gotta get with it #

687
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:29,413 
# 'cause there ain't no time
no time to scurry around #

688
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:34,919 
Hey, Riz, watch out
for them red circles.
What's wrong with the red...

689
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,604 
[screams]

690
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,106 
Nobody ever listens.

691
00:42:39,174 --> 00:42:42,243 
Red circles.
Right.

692
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,478 
[coughs]

693
00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:50,083 
Let me see.
Cheese, rat poison.
Cheese, rat poison.

694
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:52,453 
Duh!
What do you guys think,
I'm crazy or something?

695
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:54,555 
This is a no-brainer.

696
00:42:56,558 --> 00:42:59,160 
This ain't so bad.
A little breezy.

697
00:42:59,227 --> 00:43:02,029 
Oh, boy.
Whoa. Whoa!

698
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:04,165 
Whoa, whoa!

699
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:09,136 
Auntie em,
it's a twister!

700
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:12,806 
This is just like one
of those carny rides.

701
00:43:12,874 --> 00:43:15,676 
You just gotta hang on,
and at the end
I get some cotton candy.

702
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:18,128 
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

703
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,298 
[screaming]

704
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:23,767 
I'm gonna hurl!

705
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,539 
They're just trying
to play mind games here.

706
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:33,610 
But I know the cheese is safe
'cause you think I'm going
for the poison, right?

707
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:35,679 
Huh? Huh?

708
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:46,424 
- Psst.
- Huh?

709
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:49,893 
Room service.
[laughing]

710
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:55,333 
[laughing]
hey there, little fella.
How're you doin'?

711
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,770 
While they're warming up
the brain sucker for you,
I brought you a sandwich.

712
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,773 
I cut off the crusts
for you.
There you go.

713
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,609 
Oh, gee, that's nice.
Thanks.

714
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:07,978 
Anything for a celebrity.
[laughing]

715
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:11,915 
Oh, hey,
do you like jalapenos?
Sure.

716
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:16,420 
Okay!
# jalapenos
jalapenos #

717
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,726 
- [sighs]
- hey, Mopey!

718
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:24,762 
[screams]

719
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,030 
W-who said that?
I did.

720
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:29,066 
But you're
just a sandwich.

721
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:33,571 
Nah, I'm just channeling
my voice through this sandwich
to deliver this message.

722
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,806 
Great!
What's the message?

723
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:39,142 
Ahem.
We arrive at midnight tonight.

724
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,713 
Really? Do all of you
look like sandwiches?

725
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,782 
Forget about the sandwich.
All right,
I'm sorry.

726
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,050 
# jalapenos, jalapenos #

727
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:49,553 
# gettin' my friend
some jalapenos #

728
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,490 
[sandwich] here's the plan.
We're landing at your house.
What?

729
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:55,726 
No, no, wait.
Those guys know
where I live.

730
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:57,762 
They're not
the best examples
of Earthlings.

731
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:00,664 
Oh, gosh.
Where else can we land?

732
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:02,666 
Um, let's see.
Uh...

733
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:06,336 
I know! At the beach.
Go to cape doom.
Look for the lighthouse.

734
00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:10,674 
[sandwich] the lighthouse
at cape doom it is.
Boy, I didn't hear that.

735
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:13,844 
Oh, this is great.
But how do I
get out of here?

736
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:17,415 
I'm just a sandwich.
Some things you gotta
figure out for yourself.

737
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:21,385 
Oh, by the way,
go ahead and eat me now.

738
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:24,922 
You're gonna need
the energy.

739
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:29,827 
Won't that hurt?
No, it's fine.
I'm goin' away now.

740
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:32,095 
Oh. Well...

741
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:35,800 
Cape doom, right?
Yes, yes.
Cape doom.

742
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:38,502 
Are you there?

743
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,838 
Hello? Hello?

744
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,840 
Huh. Well...

745
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:45,275 
[cell door opens]

746
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,411 
Aah!

747
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:55,018 
Wow!
Just a little
further up, Fozzie.

748
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,421 
Stop, Fozzie.
Stop here, Fozzie.
That's it.

749
00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:00,458 
Oh! Oh!
Sorry.

750
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:36,360 
Aah!
Animal.

751
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:40,030 
Huh?
Sorry.

752
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,767 
[frightened squeals]

753
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:49,740 
Stand back, boys.
This is a job for a woman.

754
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,742 
Hmm.
Hmm.

755
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,779 
A woman!
Woman!
Shh!

756
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:58,149 
Hello!

757
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:02,520 
What's a nice man like you
doing in a guardhouse
like this?

758
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:05,256 
I'm buffalo hunting.
What does it look like
I'm doing?

759
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,625 
This is a restricted area.
You gotta go.

760
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:09,426 
Oh, no.

761
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,796 
Look deeply into my eyes
and tell me
you want me to go.

762
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:17,701 
I want you to go.
Understand?

763
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:20,471 
Now.
Ahh...

764
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:22,506 
Okay.

765
00:47:24,376 --> 00:47:26,677 
I thought I told...

766
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,916 
What was I saying?

767
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:36,187 
You were saying
you were going
to open the gate.

768
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:40,591 
Open the gate.
Open the gate.

769
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:43,794 
Of course, open the gate.
Come on in. Welcome.
[whistles]

770
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,962 
Come on, guys.
Oh, boy!

771
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,932 
Uh... now tell me
I'm beautiful, sweetheart.

772
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,303 
You are beautiful,
sweetheart.

773
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,738 
Oh, thank you.
[laughs]

774
00:47:54,806 --> 00:47:58,775 
Oh, boy! He fell on you
like a ton of bricks.
Naturalement.

775
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:02,379 
Have a nice time.
Oh, I like your tie.
Very nice.

776
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,181 
Thank you.

777
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,684 
So long.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

778
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:10,020 
[chuckles]
what a handsome family.

779
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:13,357 
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

780
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:16,126 
Hey, rodents!

781
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:18,395 
You know all that cheese
I promised you...

782
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:22,533 
After you ran that maze
and took those tests?
Yeah.

783
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:25,236 
It was delicious!

784
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:28,939 
[wicked laughing]

785
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,510 
No cheese?
[door closes]

786
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:38,148 
No cheese?
All right, that does it!

787
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,951 
We're bustin' out
of this joint, boys.

788
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:45,822 
Even if we got over the wall,
we couldn't turn the doorknob.
Yeah.

789
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,692 
Who needs doorknobs?

790
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,494 
Doh!

791
00:48:50,562 --> 00:48:53,063 
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Wow!

792
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:55,065 
Huh? Huh?
[together]
yeah! Yeah!

793
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:57,167 
[excited chattering]

794
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:59,236 
Shh!

795
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:04,475 
Very nice.
[wicked laughing]

796
00:49:08,647 --> 00:49:11,848 
Okay, guys.
We gotta get through
that door.

797
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:15,018 
Should we ask permission
from those nice men
with the rifles?

798
00:49:15,086 --> 00:49:17,020 
Those are the bad guys!

799
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:20,624 
Oh!
All right, everybody.
It's time to get invisible.

800
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:23,527 
Fozzie,
get the duck.

801
00:49:23,595 --> 00:49:26,563 
Ooh, the duckie!
Me first.
Me first.

802
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,533 
Here it goes.
[duck squeaking]
okay.

803
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:32,068 
Hey, I look thinner.
[Kermit]
spray yourself, Fozzie.

804
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,805 
Okay.
[squeaking]

805
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:38,509 
Wow! Oh, hey!
I like this.

806
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:40,511 
[Kermit]
all right, lose the duck.

807
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,381 
Yes, sir. Listen up. This stuff doesn't
last long, so let's go.

808
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,284 
Yes! Yes!
[Kermit]
ooh, you're squashing me.

809
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:50,487 
[Miss Piggy] sorry, Kermie.
[Pepe] come on, Kermit.
I will help you up.

810
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:53,424 
Oh, Kermit,
you're so soft and plump.

811
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,293 
[Miss Piggy]
you got one second to get
your hands off me, shrimp.

812
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:59,029 
Ooh, sorry, Piggy.
[Kermit]
come on. Let's go.

813
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,299 
Shh, shh.
[Fozzie] I have to go
to the little bathroom.

814
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,367 
[Kermit]
oh, Fozzie!

815
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:11,709 
[Pepe]
smoking is very bad
for you, okay?

816
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:15,445 
Bob,
didn't know you cared.

817
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:22,335 
[female on P.A. System]
paging Dr. Van neuter. Report
to alien surgery number 5.

818
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:25,205 
Hello.

819
00:50:26,373 --> 00:50:28,675 
I'm Dr. Van neuter.

820
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:31,945 
I'll be your
brain surgeon today,
if you don't mind.

821
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:34,314 
Get it?
"brain surgeon. Mind."

822
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:36,316 
[laughs]
ah.

823
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:40,520 
Oh, feeling a little nervous,
are we?
Of course I'm nervous.

824
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:43,824 
Don't worry.
Everyone is before having
their brain sucked out.

825
00:50:43,891 --> 00:50:46,860 
Now, don't you go away.

826
00:50:46,928 --> 00:50:49,162 
[sighs, grunts]

827
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,099 
[toilet flushes]

828
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:56,569 
Okay, Kermit.
I'm ready.

829
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:59,405 
[Kermit]
Fozzie, tell me
you didn't wash your hands.

830
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,876 
Of course I did.
Mom said, "always
wash your hands."

831
00:51:02,944 --> 00:51:05,612 
Yes, but not
when you're wearing
invisibility spray!

832
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,314 
Mom said,
"no exceptions."

833
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:10,517 
Never ever.
Uh-uh.

834
00:51:10,584 --> 00:51:12,719 
What...
stop! You!

835
00:51:12,787 --> 00:51:14,454 
Hands... Up!

836
00:51:14,522 --> 00:51:16,222 
Oh! Oh!
All right.

837
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,994 
Remain calm.
I'm gonna have to take
you two into custody.

838
00:51:21,062 --> 00:51:24,131 
Wait.
Let me explain, lady.
You don't have... no!

839
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:27,350 
Where...
where are your forearms?

840
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:29,520 
[growling]
[screams]

841
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,822 
[animal] woman! [Kermit] animal!

842
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:35,225 
Animal, get back here!
Animal!
Woman! Woman!

843
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:38,896 
Oh, dear.
Give me a second
to think.

844
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:41,498 
He doesn't seem to be
on this floor, so he...

845
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:44,701 
[embarrassed mumbling]

846
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:48,405 
[grunting]
oh!

847
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:52,643 
# la, la, la, la, la
la, la... La #

848
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,479 
Wow.

849
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:57,815 
I should, uh,
go change, okay.

850
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:01,518 
Come on, everybody.
We need to find
better cover.

851
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,322 
# la, la, la, la, la
la, la #

852
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:08,258 
Just ahead here,
general Luft, sir.

853
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:10,260 
Here we go.

854
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:14,731 
Ah. This is our new
retinal scanner, general.
Oh.

855
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,268 
[beeps]

856
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,104 
Yeah.
[chuckles,
clears throat]

857
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:23,507 
[beeping]
[yelling]

858
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:25,992 
[moaning]

859
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:30,297 
General Luft, sir.
This had better be good.

860
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:32,299 
Whoa.

861
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,551 
Come on, fellows.
Let's go.

862
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,020 
Shh.

863
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:41,624 
Whew. Aye.
Hey, Riz, Riz?
Where you goin'?

864
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:44,561 
You guys go ahead.
I gotta go find my friend.

865
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:48,265 
What? You could
get caught! Are you nuts?
[together] yeah.

866
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,300 
I guess I'll take
my chances.

867
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:53,770 
It was nice meetin' you guys.
See you later, huh?

868
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,772 
[mice mumbling]
so long, Riz.

869
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,774 
Bye, Rizzo.
Good luck.

870
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,943 
Kid's got moxie.

871
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:02,346 
[shakes]
yeah, moxie.

872
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,915 
What is "moxie"? [Dr.
Van neuter] before we get started...

873
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:08,051 
Let's see here.
Do you now
or have you ever...

874
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:10,888 
Experienced any achiness
in your tentacles?

875
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:15,359 
I don't have tentacles.
Oh, good!
No achy tentacles. Good.

876
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:17,995 
Head ever come off?
No, I don't think so.

877
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:20,063 
Good, good, good.

878
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:22,332 
Any gingivitis?
No.

879
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,568 
Great!
How 'bout that beaky thing
you've got there?

880
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:28,872 
Ever had any problems
with that? Itching?
Swelling? Flaking?

881
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,474 
Some flaking
a couple years ago.
Who cares?

882
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,778 
It's show time!
# doot, doot, doot #

883
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:37,047 
Here we go.
Oh, brother.

884
00:53:37,115 --> 00:53:40,650 
Excellent.
# [humming]
w-what's that thing?

885
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,686 
I don't know.
Here we go.

886
00:53:42,754 --> 00:53:45,856 
Just stay... Like that.
Okay?

887
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:51,929 
This way.

888
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:53,997 
[Miss Piggy]
whose bright idea
was this, anyway?

889
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:58,535 
[Fozzie]
which way, Kermit?
Kermit, this way.

890
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:01,504 
[Miss Piggy]
I can't breathe in here.
Come on, Kerm.

891
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:04,007 
Okay, here we go.
Wait! Wait!

892
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:07,844 
- What is it?
- Are you sure this is covered
by my H.M.O.?

893
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,480 
Huh?
Good question.

894
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,383 
I'll check.
[sighs]

895
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:19,823 
Psst. Gonzo?
Rizzo! You're alive!
Where have you been?

896
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:23,694 
You don't even want to know.
Sit tight while I see if I can
chew through these straps.

897
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,996 
Yeah, yeah.
Good. Good.
Ah, good news!

898
00:54:26,064 --> 00:54:28,131 
You're covered
with a $10 co-pay.

899
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:30,634 
Okay, hold still.
And remember,

900
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:34,504 
If you experience
any sort of unpleasantness,
please let me know.

901
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:37,908 
- I would hate to miss it.
- Hmm? Hmm?

902
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:40,978 
Do you mind?
Oh, excuse me.

903
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:43,013 
Wait!

904
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:45,849 
Oh, good lord, a rat!
I hate rats!

905
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:50,453 
Then today ain't
your lucky day, doc.

906
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:52,723 
Oh! No!

907
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,058 
Doc, ready for
an operation?
A little experiment.

908
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:57,961 
Forward, Piggy.
Forward.

909
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:00,063 
[groaning]

910
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,968 
# [humming]

911
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:07,004 
Doctor.
Doctor.

912
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:09,640 
Doctor?
Doctor.
Oh, doctor. Doctor.

913
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:13,110 
Just a couple of doctors.
Doctors in the hallway.

914
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,445 
Whew!
That was close.

915
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,781 
[Gonzo groaning]
to the right, Fozzie.

916
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:19,783 
Forward, Piggy.

917
00:55:19,851 --> 00:55:23,787 
Too fast!
The door, the door!
Stop!

918
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:27,858 
- [yelling] no! No!
- What in the world?

919
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,460 
This is big, general.

920
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:33,363 
I think we should notify
the president.

921
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:37,034 
I'll be the judge
of that.
As always, sir.

922
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:39,269 
No, don't tickle me!

923
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,304 
What do we do?

924
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:45,441 
Will you get me out
of here?
Mmm! Hmph!

925
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,078 
[Dr. Van neuter laughing]
no, no, no!

926
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:50,180 
I can't breathe!

927
00:55:52,249 --> 00:55:55,835 
Hey, guys! Quick!
Get me out of here.

928
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,654 
Today, sir,

929
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,723 
We must think
with a big mind.

930
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,992 
Behold.

931
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:07,197 
Irrefutable evidence
of extraterrestrial life.

932
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,441 
Release me.

933
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:23,880 
Ooh.

934
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:29,086 
This looks worse
than it is, general.
Obviously...

935
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:31,304 
Get off of me,
you vermin!

936
00:56:31,372 --> 00:56:33,906 
The alien is loose
in the building.

937
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:37,243 
- But not to worry, because...
- don't bother.

938
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,479 
You're terminated.
Uh...

939
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:41,614 
When you say
"terminated"...

940
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:43,950 
You need help, singer!

941
00:56:44,017 --> 00:56:47,153 
Find some!

942
00:56:47,221 --> 00:56:49,656 
Mm-mmm.

943
00:56:52,025 --> 00:56:55,695 
How'd that go for ya?
Okay?

944
00:56:55,763 --> 00:56:58,998 
[elevator bell rings]
sorry I got you
into this mess.

945
00:56:59,066 --> 00:57:01,000 
Thanks for coming
to save me.

946
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:04,036 
Thank us when we're
safely out of here.
All right, quietly.

947
00:57:04,104 --> 00:57:06,840 
Right. Shh.

948
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:09,308 
[female guard]
stop! Come back here!
[excited chattering]

949
00:57:09,377 --> 00:57:11,310 
Help! Help me!

950
00:57:11,379 --> 00:57:13,946 
Please, listen to me!

951
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:18,385 
You can't leave me.
I need you.

952
00:57:19,387 --> 00:57:21,654 
[together]
oooh!

953
00:57:23,624 --> 00:57:26,893 
Yah! I go now.

954
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,164 
Fine. Go on, go.
You're all alike.
Hmm?

955
00:57:32,232 --> 00:57:35,435 
Animals.
[sobbing]

956
00:57:35,503 --> 00:57:37,370 
Ahh.

957
00:57:37,438 --> 00:57:40,573 
Call me.

958
00:57:40,641 --> 00:57:43,410 
[Kermit]
psst. Animal.

959
00:57:43,477 --> 00:57:45,412 
Come here.
Yeah? Yeah?

960
00:57:45,479 --> 00:57:50,050 
Way to go, Romeo.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, let's go.

961
00:57:50,117 --> 00:57:52,752 
I'm gonna kill somebody.
Whoa. Now, now.

962
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:56,256 
Remember, calm blue ocean.
You let it go.

963
00:57:56,323 --> 00:58:00,260 
Baby steps, remember?
Baby...
find the alien!

964
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:04,230 
Now!
Y-yes, sir.

965
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:07,450 
[shouting]

966
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,293 
Try that door.
It won't budge.

967
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:21,531 
Forget that door!
Come on!

968
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,300 
[all gasp]
this way.

969
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:27,537 
Quick, the door
in the jar.
It's right here.

970
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:31,174 
- Yeah, yeah.
- Um, "open jar
away from face."

971
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:35,445 
Will you please
just open the jar?
Hurry, throw it!

972
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:44,287 
Gee, that's
disappointing.

973
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,157 
Perfect. Somebody knock
and see if Barbie's home.

974
00:58:47,225 --> 00:58:49,459 
Works for me.
Adios.

975
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:52,829 
What?

976
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:57,133 
Oh, I cannot believe
that little shrimp
left us behind.

977
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,135 
I am not a shrimp!

978
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,671 
I am a king prawn!
Let's go. Come on.

979
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:08,478 
Hurry, hurry!
Come on, guys, hurry!
We have to go! Aaah!

980
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:14,384 
Keep going, everybody.
Don't look back. Run! Run!

981
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:17,287 
[guard]
you're new, eh?
Did you have a good time?

982
00:59:17,355 --> 00:59:19,256 
Bye-bye.

983
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:22,158 
[animal]
bye-bye, nice man.
[laughs]

984
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:25,328 
[siren wailing]
what the heck is goin' on?

985
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:27,730 
We did it!
[Kermit]
see that, guys?

986
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:31,134 
When we pull together,
we can do anything.
You bet we can.

987
00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:35,605 
Now we can meet
my alien brothers
at cape doom.

988
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:39,842 
Um, what makes you think
aliens are landing there,
Gonzo?

989
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:41,978 
Oh. A sandwich told me.

990
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:45,215 
- Oh, no.
- [Rizzo]
I'd give it a rest, buddy.

991
00:59:45,283 --> 00:59:50,120 
Do you mean that you guys
still don't believe me?
Well...

992
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:54,557 
All right, fine.
Stop the bus.
I'll get there by myself.

993
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,993 
No, wait, Gonzo.
Look.

994
00:59:57,061 --> 01:00:00,130 
It doesn't matter
what we believe.

995
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:04,200 
I mean, if you believe
that you need to go and
meet your alien brothers,

996
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:07,603 
Then I say, well...

997
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,906 
I say we're goin'
to the beach.
Right, guys?

998
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:12,976 
- To the beach, okay.
- To the beach.

999
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:17,013 
Great! Thanks, guys.
Beach ball!

1000
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:19,549 
Get the crew
down to cape doom
on the double.

1001
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,685 
This is my exclusive,
so don't tell anyone!

1002
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,854 
Okay, I've got it.
Pack it up, guys.

1003
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:28,558 
The space ship
is landing at cape doom.

1004
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,726 
[excited chattering]

1005
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:42,105 
[singer]
where is he?

1006
01:00:42,173 --> 01:00:45,342 
Well, I didn't overhear
anything. I...

1007
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:51,214 
Did I ask you
if you overheard anything?

1008
01:00:51,282 --> 01:00:55,118 
No, sir.
Because if you did
overhear anything,

1009
01:00:55,186 --> 01:00:59,356 
I'm sure
you would tell me.
Y-yes, sir.

1010
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,524 
Or do I have to remind you...

1011
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:06,629 
Of Mr. Jumbo's circus town
and wild animal revue?

1012
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:09,299 
Where is he going?

1013
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,803 
Oh, look.

1014
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:16,439 
Sunday's half price
at the petting zoo.

1015
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:18,908 
Okay, okay, okay!

1016
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:22,545 
They're goin'
to cape doom.
Good. Good.

1017
01:01:22,613 --> 01:01:25,482 
Get me the subatomic
neutro-destablizer.

1018
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:27,550 
Hmm?

1019
01:01:27,618 --> 01:01:31,687 
The subatomic neutro...
oh, the really big gun.

1020
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:34,090 
The really big gun.
Yes, sir.

1021
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:35,958 
The really big gun.

1022
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:41,031 
[laughing, grunts]

1023
01:01:41,098 --> 01:01:43,933 
Really big gun!
Clip.

1024
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:46,136 
Clip.

1025
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,304 
Wow.

1026
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:53,609 
Let's head for my car.
Oh, problem there, sir.

1027
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:58,515 
Uh, remember those
parking tickets you asked me
to take care of for you?

1028
01:01:58,582 --> 01:02:03,453 
And I said that...
oh, just say it.

1029
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:05,555 
Car's impounded.

1030
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:10,093 
Ooh! We can take
my company car.

1031
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:12,095 
Fine.
Great.

1032

[Rentro]
# sixty-six bottles of beer

# sixty-six bottles of beer #
[singer]
excuse me. Excuse me!

1034
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:23,273 
Can this thing
go any faster?
I'm doin' 30.

1035
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,741 
You wanna slow down
there, buddy?

1036
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:29,512 
Lotta traffic tonight.
Safety first.

1037
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:41,624 
[crowd cheering]

1038
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:52,001 
[chanting]
Gonzo! Gonzo!
Gonzo! Gonzo!

1039
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:54,637 
What's with all
these crazy people?
[chuckles]

1040
01:02:54,705 --> 01:02:58,074 
Can I help it if moi has such devoted fans?

1041
01:02:58,142 --> 01:03:00,076 
[chuckles]
ah.

1042
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:03,913 
- [chanting continues]
- all right,
everybody back off!

1043
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:06,316 
Make way for the alien.
Let his royal weirdness
through.

1044
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:09,752 
[Pepe]
everybody be cool.
Stay back. Be cool, okay.

1045
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,156 
Gonzo! Gonzo!
Gonzo! Gonzo!

1046
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:16,226 
Get your Gonzo t-shirts

1047
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,761 
[Bunsen laughing]
ooh.

1048
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:21,531 
Good-bye, rainbow.
And stay groovy.

1049

[chanting]

1050
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:44,554 
Hmm. Got cold.

1051
01:03:44,622 --> 01:03:46,623 
Yeah, sure did.

1052
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,625 
[Miss Piggy]
midnight.

1053
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:51,894 
The lone alien
stands before a naked Sky.

1054
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:55,648 
The mood is tense.
My hair looks great.

1055
01:03:55,715 --> 01:04:00,819 
What?
I don't believe this!
Oh, Shelley. Bonjour.

1056
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:03,822 
You backstabbing,
underhanded little
coffee pig!

1057
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,791 
What?
This is my show!

1058
01:04:05,859 --> 01:04:08,994 
My story!
My microphones.

1059
01:04:09,063 --> 01:04:11,597 
This is Shelley Snipes
reporting. Please ignore
the little sow.

1060
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:13,799 
Disregard this woman.

1061
01:04:13,867 --> 01:04:16,969 
[screams]
hai-ya!

1062
01:04:18,972 --> 01:04:21,707 
[shouting]

1063
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,462 
What am I doing?
Um...

1064
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:45,598 
You are about to give me
your job and get everyone here
a cup of coffee.

1065
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:47,600 
Oh, yes.
Of course.

1066
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:50,636 
Right away.
Ohh.

1067
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:55,208 
I love this stuff!

1068
01:04:55,275 --> 01:04:58,611 
How ya doin'?
Excuse me, buddy.

1069
01:04:58,678 --> 01:05:02,181 
And a happy Halloween
to ya, as well.
Ooh! Ooh!

1070
01:05:02,249 --> 01:05:05,918 
[yelling]
Riz, take it easy.
It's all right.

1071
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:08,687 
What do you mean,
it's all right?
You don't understand.

1072
01:05:08,755 --> 01:05:11,457 
We let him slide,
and he gave us a ride.

1073
01:05:11,525 --> 01:05:14,494 
Yeah, yeah.
I love all my new
rat friends now.

1074
01:05:14,561 --> 01:05:17,696 
Who wants this next
marshmallow?
You believe that?

1075
01:05:17,764 --> 01:05:20,032 
Look at that.
Fellas, look who's here.

1076
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,767 
[together]
hey, buddy!

1077
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,905 
Too bad Dawson
isn't here for this.
Tell me about it.

1078
01:05:26,973 --> 01:05:29,742 
This whole situation
is like something out of
one of his sci-fi movies.

1079
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:32,978 
But this is a Muppet movie.
It's much more realistic...

1080
01:05:33,046 --> 01:05:36,415 
And romantic, okay.

1081
01:05:36,483 --> 01:05:38,251 
Right.

1082
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:40,719 
What's your deal?
You some sort of alien?

1083
01:05:40,787 --> 01:05:43,222 
No, baby.
Me and Gonzo are very tight.

1084
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:45,891 
In fact,
we gonna be chillin'
in our hot tub later on.

1085
01:05:45,959 --> 01:05:48,594 
Perhaps you'd like
to partake in the "partay."

1086
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:52,165 
Geeks.

1087
01:05:52,232 --> 01:05:55,268 
All right,
don't answer right away.
We'll be here.

1088
01:05:55,335 --> 01:05:57,436 
Oh, she'll be back.

1089
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:06,245 
1:00 a.m.

1090
01:06:06,313 --> 01:06:09,715 
The alien is still
standing over there.

1091
01:06:09,783 --> 01:06:11,817 
My hair still looks great.

1092
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,986 
And one
can only wonder...

1093
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:18,123 
What Gonzo's feeling
right now.

1094
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,995 
They're not comin'.

1095
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:26,265 
Well, maybe they're
just running late.

1096
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:30,203 
It's a no-show.
It's a no-show.
What?

1097
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:33,372 
Wait a second.
I believed you, man.

1098
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,677 
Yeah. I stayed up
all night dancing,

1099
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,546 
And didn't study
for finals because of you.

1100
01:06:40,614 --> 01:06:43,616 
I'm cold.
Come on. Let's go.

1101
01:06:43,684 --> 01:06:46,051 
Uh... uh...

1102
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:48,120 
What a bust.

1103
01:06:48,188 --> 01:06:50,189 
I'm outta here.

1104
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:06,989 
[gasps]
look!

1105
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:09,692 
[gasps]

1106
01:08:02,229 --> 01:08:05,932 
Boy, they're
really tiny.

1107
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:11,003 
But tiny is not
a bad thing, right?

1108
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:14,907 
Uh, no. Yeah, yeah.
Tiny's good.
Wait a minute.

1109
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:18,878 
Are you telling me we came here
in the middle of the night
for a stupid egg?

1110
01:08:18,946 --> 01:08:21,647 
Shh. It could be
full of chocolate.

1111
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:26,285 
[crowd]
ooh!

1112
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:15,418 
Shoot it!
Shoot it!

1113
01:09:27,548 --> 01:09:31,901 
Hokey-pokey!
Please, big boss.
I never disobeyed my mother.

1114
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:35,971 
And I never carried the plague.
Not even once! Ohh!

1115
01:10:09,356 --> 01:10:12,691 
Are you okay, Gonzo?
Great.
Never felt better.

1116
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:29,125 
Let the one
who is called Gonzo...

1117
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:31,727 
Step forward.

1118
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,362 
That's me!

1119
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,365 
I-I mean,
I'm Gonzo.

1120
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:39,018 
Step a little closer.

1121
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,024 
Come a little further forward.

1122
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:50,329 
Could you lean into the light?
There you go.

1123
01:10:50,397 --> 01:10:52,598 
Lean in.
A little further.

1124
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:55,384 
A little further.
Yeah.

1125
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:58,254 
That's him!

01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:12,217 
Many zotons ago
you were lost to us.

1129
01:11:12,285 --> 01:11:16,589

01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:26,432

# celebrate good times

1156
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:47,013 
Come on, Gonzo.
Wanna see you up here
on the stage!

1157
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,615 
Me?
Yeah, you boy.
Ha, ha, ha!

# celebrate good times

1161
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:07,316 
[cheering, applause]

1162
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:10,719 
[alien singer]
yeah, it's the great Gonzo!

1163
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:14,089 
This way.

1164
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:19,295 
Gonzo, it is time
to take...

1165
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:22,030 
Your righteous place
amongst your brothers.

1166
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:24,866 
- Oh, thanks...
- here you go.

1167
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:30,639 
[UberGonzo]
by surviving and thriving
alone on this alien planet...

1168
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:34,677 
You have proven yourself
audacious, courageous and
distinctly one of a kind.

1169
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,980 
# [drumroll]
we welcome you back
with our most ceremonious...

1170
01:13:38,048 --> 01:13:41,883 
Of ceremonies.
[Gonzo]
what's that?

1171
01:13:41,952 --> 01:13:43,953 
We gonna blow you up,
baby.

1172
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:49,875 
[male singer]
# it's your thing
do what you wanna do #

1173
01:13:51,544 --> 01:13:55,380 
# I can't tell you
who to sock it to #
yes! Ha, ha, ha!

1174
01:13:55,448 --> 01:13:57,416 
# it's your thing # [together]
ahh!

1175
01:13:57,483 --> 01:14:00,452 
Ha, ha, ha!
Arriba.
# do what you wanna do #

1176
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,823 
[laughing]
I love these people!

1177
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:05,891 
Comin' down.

1178
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:11,913 
Cowabunga!

1179
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:14,583 
[yelling, laughing]

1180
01:14:16,336 --> 01:14:19,338 
Oh, no!

1181
01:14:19,405 --> 01:14:21,357 
Uh-oh.

1182
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:23,425 
Where's he gone?

1183
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:26,862 
Ta-da!

1184
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,865 
[cheering]
hey, buddy!

1185
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:33,002 
He's okay.
He's all right.

1186
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:36,938 
Now that is what I call
"the great Gonzo."

1187
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:40,609 
[cheering continues]

1188
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:43,429 
Ha, ha! Yeah!

1189
01:14:45,265 --> 01:14:48,300 
My hero!
[Gonzo]
yes! Yes!

1190
01:14:52,272 --> 01:14:54,223 
Yeah! Yeah!
[singer]
hold it!

1191
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,559 
- Hold it.
- Wha...

1192
01:14:57,627 --> 01:15:00,129 
Get outta the way,
you freak.

1193
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:05,534 
Very, very moving,
my little alien friend.

1194
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:10,355 
But I'm afraid
your timing is off.

1195
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,208 
Now, you're coming
back with me...

1196
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:16,978 
In my c-cement truck.

1197
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:19,932 
[chuckling]

1198
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,617 
What's so funny?

1199
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,153 
[laughing]

1200
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,939 
Don't laugh at me.

1201
01:15:27,007 --> 01:15:28,957 
Don't laugh...
all right.

1202
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:34,563 
- I'll show you laughter.
- No.

1203
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:38,099 
[computer voice]
please load weapon.
Please load weapon.

1204
01:15:39,018 --> 01:15:41,019 
Please load weapon.

1205
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:46,258 
Ah, come on.

1206
01:15:46,326 --> 01:15:48,577 
Come on!
[laughing]

1207
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:52,080 
Aah!

1208
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:58,620 
Ooh! Ooh!

1209
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:03,275 
This certainly is good.

1210
01:16:03,343 --> 01:16:05,527 
That was a close one.
[clears throat]

1211
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:08,630 
Not as close
as you think, my friend.

1212
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:13,201 
"please load weapon."
ahh.

1213
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:17,005 
[sobbing]

1214
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:21,643 
We are honored to meet you.
A most extraordinary performance.

1215
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:23,946 
What are you
talking about?

1216
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:28,817 
Gonzo of Earth, who is
this most entertaining
friend of yours?

1217
01:16:28,885 --> 01:16:32,053 
That's ed.
Hi, ed.
Hello, ed.

1218
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:35,290 
The cape.
The cape!
The cape for ed.

1219
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:39,795 
Ed, because of
your comic instincts,

1220
01:16:39,863 --> 01:16:43,999 
We have chosen you
as ambassador to our planet.

1221
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,134 
Get down.

1222
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:49,170 
You mean you want me
to go with you?

1223
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,239 
To...

1224
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:56,879 
Boldly go where
no man has gone before.

1225
01:16:56,946 --> 01:17:00,448 
It would be
our great privilege, ed.

1226
01:17:00,517 --> 01:17:02,450 
Uh, may I call you...

1227
01:17:02,519 --> 01:17:05,888 
Zongo?
[mumbling]
Zongo.

1228
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:12,494 
To travel the stars
like a modern-day Magellan.

1229
01:17:12,562 --> 01:17:17,733 
To be up there with
John Glenn, Neil Armstrong.
Yeah, okay.

1230
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:22,270 
You better get goin'.
They're waitin' for ya.
Run along now.

1231
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,640 
This way, Zongo.

1232
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:26,842 
Zongo.
Zongo.

1233
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:31,780 
Baby steps, sir.

1234
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:34,716 
Ha, ha.
Baby steps.

1235
01:17:34,784 --> 01:17:39,187 
Time to beat feet.
Come along, little brother.

1236
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:42,024 
Ah!
Oh, boy.

1237
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:44,693 
This is happening
so fast.

1238
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:48,296 
Gee. Well, guys,
you know,

1239
01:17:48,364 --> 01:17:52,418 
I'm gonna miss you,
and I'll be thinking about you.

1240
01:17:52,485 --> 01:17:55,387 
Rizzo, buddy...
no, no, not me.

1241
01:17:55,455 --> 01:17:59,425 
I do not do good-byes. Well,
I just wanna tell ya...

1242
01:17:59,492 --> 01:18:03,529 
I just want you
to take care of yourself.

1243
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:08,634 
Hey, don't worry about me.
I... I can always get
another roommate.

1244
01:18:08,702 --> 01:18:11,303 
Ah, buddy.
[sniffling]

1245
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:16,107 
Take care.
You too.

1246
01:18:16,175 --> 01:18:21,279 
And Kermit,
you're the best friend
any alien could ask for.

1247
01:18:21,348 --> 01:18:26,585 
Well, w-we love you,
Gonzo.

1248
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:34,793 
So, you'll write?

1249
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:36,928 
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll write.

1250
01:18:36,996 --> 01:18:39,898 
There's probably
a mail box
every couple of light-years.

1251
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:44,269 
[chuckles] yeah.
Hey, adios, Mr. Spaceman,
okay.

1252
01:18:44,337 --> 01:18:48,240 
Hey, man, you keep
sayin' good-bye, and
you'll never get home.

1253
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,676 
Oh, yeah. Home.

1254
01:18:50,744 --> 01:18:53,178 
Home.

1255
01:18:54,748 --> 01:18:56,749 
Time to go home.

1256
01:19:03,055 --> 01:19:05,758 
Ah. Ahh.

1257
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:09,160 
[crying]

1258
01:19:13,633 --> 01:19:16,902 
The stars beckon.

1259
01:19:18,971 --> 01:19:21,273 
Shall we go home?

1260
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:31,950 
I don't think so.

1261
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:37,272 
Gonzo?

1262
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,542 
Thank you for going to so much trouble
to find me.

1263
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:44,479 
But I can't go.

1264
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:50,385 
I love these guys.

1265
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:54,690 
My life is here.

1266
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:58,393 
This is my home.

1267
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:03,315 
If that is your decision,

1268
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:06,151 
Then we shall abide by it.

1269
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:08,403 
We will miss you.

1270
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:12,057 
So, good luck, Gonzo.

1271
01:20:14,594 --> 01:20:18,780 
Yes.
People of Earth!
Later.

1272
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:22,217 
- Yes!
- [all chattering]

1273
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:24,352 
Oh, boy.
Good-bye!

1274
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,356 
Ha-ha!
You're back!
You're back!

1275
01:20:29,459 --> 01:20:31,460 
People of Earth,

1276
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:37,966 
This is one small step
for man,

1277
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:43,204 
And one giant step for...

1278
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:45,640 
Well, forget it.

1279
01:21:29,268 --> 01:21:31,670 
[Gonzo]
what a great day.
Mm-hmm.

1280
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:34,606 
That was probably
the best day
of my whole life.

1281
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:40,612 
There's just one thing
I still don't understand.
What's that, Gonzo?

1282
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:44,282 
Why did they ask me
to build a jacuzzi?

1283
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:47,553 
[chuckling]
