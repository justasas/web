1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,160
Sorry!

2
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
Hey, wait for me!

3
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Hold the boat!

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm coming!

5
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Noah! Mr. The Ark! I'm here.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,320
Barely made it. I thought
you were gonna leave without...

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,680
Gee, Mr. Noah, sir...

8
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,400
...I'm gonna come too.

9
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,480
What are you, anyway?

10
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,080
Good question.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,680
Now, technically speaking...

12
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,640
...let's say, put me down
as a "whatever."

13
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,840
What do you mean?
What is your species?

14
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,720
I don't know.
I guess there's only one of me.

15
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,600
Then you are doomed!

16
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,720
Wait. Wait!

17
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
Yes, sir?

18
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,440
You may need this.

19
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,360
But, but, but...

20
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,760
No! No! No!

21
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,800
I don't wanna be alone!

22
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,160
No, I don't wanna be alone.

23
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,920
No, no, no!

24
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,040
I don't wanna be alone!

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,000
You're not alone.

26
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
Who said that?

27
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,640
Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's the rat
who's hanging out of the window!

28
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,720
Rizzo?

29
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,760
No, it's Santa,
but I forgot my reindeer.

30
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,320
- I'm sorry, Rizzo.
- Yeah, right.

31
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,040
Boy.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,120
I had that weird dream again.

33
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,920
Oh, yeah? The one with the goat and
the dwarf and the jar of peanut butter?

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
No, it was the one where...
Forget it. You wouldn't understand.

35
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,640
I'd understand.
Come on, we're roommates.

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,360
Hey, hey, hey.

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm here for you, man.

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,360
Okay. It's the one where
I'm talking to this Noah guy...

39
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,680
...and he won't let me on his boat
because I'm all...

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,240
...alone.

41
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,480
Good night, Rizzo.

42
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,720
Morning.

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,120
What? Hey, man!

44
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,280
I do it all for you, ladies.

45
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,080
And scrunch.

46
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,720
Scrunch it. And right. And left.

47
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,680
And suck in those tummies, ladies!

48
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,840
That was fun. Way to get down
with your bad selves.

49
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,560
- Pass the bagel.
- Good morning, Rowlf.

50
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,640
Good morning, Bob.

51
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,640
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning.

52
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,640
Hello, little people!

53
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,680
What an absolutely splendid day!

54
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,320
How are you, Piggy?

55
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,560
Late. I start my fabulous
new job today.

56
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,760
We megastar TV journalists
have to be punctual, you know.

57
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,360
- TV journalist...?
- Gotta run. Bye, Kermie.

58
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
Kissie, kissie.

59
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,520
- Is breakfast over?
- No, why?

60
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,200
Because I think
the bacon just ran out.

61
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,640
The raspberry flapovers
will be out in a moment.

62
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,920
Uncle Kermit, what'll you do
now that you're on vacation?

63
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,720
Robin, as soon as I get
those housepainters started...

64
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,120
...I'm gonna kick back and relax.

65
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,120
- When will you fix the oven, okay?
- What's wrong with the oven?

66
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,320
That.

67
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,360
Popovers kaput!

68
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,440
I'll put it on the top of my list.

69
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
There is a menu correction, okay.

70
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,720
We will now be serving
bologna sandwiches.

71
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,880
But no bread.

72
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,040
I'm already gone.

73
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,560
Hey, Gonzo. Aren't you performing
at that bar mitzvah today?

74
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,960
Electric Mayhem's covering for me.

75
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
Shalom.

76
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,680
But you never miss the chance
to shoot yourself out of a cannon.

77
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,080
Something wrong?

78
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
- No.
- Okay.

79
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,360
It's just that I'm sick and tired of
being a one-of-a-kind freak, that's all.

80
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,680
Gonzo, you are not
a one-of-a-kind freak. You're a...

81
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,640
A whatever?

82
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
- Well, yeah.
- You see?

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,040
See what I mean? I don't even know
where I came from or who I am.

84
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,160
Yo, Kerm.

85
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,040
You weren't waiting for some painters,
were you?

86
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Yeah.

87
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
- They're driving away.
- What?

88
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,920
- Animal bit one of them.
- Oh, no.

89
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,720
Wait, guys!

90
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,600
Don't let them go!

91
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,480
You know what you are, Gonzo?

92
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,760
- What?
- Distinct.

93
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,360
Hey, wait, guys! He didn't mean it!
He's just a musician!

94
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,440
Musician, musician, musician!

95
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,520
Distinct, huh?

96
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
More like extinct.

97
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,520
"Watch the sky"? Hey, hey!

98
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,480
Rizzo, come here. I think my Kap'n
Alphabet is sending me a message.

99
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,600
I know what you mean.

100
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,560
I had some guacamole last night,
and it's still speaking to me.

101
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,480
No, really. Look, look.
I'm not kidding.

102
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,120
Well, it was there just a second ago.

103
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,520
I swear, Rizzo.
It said, "Watch the sky."

104
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,600
Are you sure it didn't say,
"You need help"?

105
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,120
But, but...

106
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,800
Look, maybe you and your cereal
would like to be alone.

107
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
Oh, boy.

108
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
My bologna has a first name

109
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,120
It's O-S-C-A-R

110
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,120
Cool.

111
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,840
"R U there"?

112
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,320
Rizzo!

113
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,440
C.O.V.N.E.T.
Top-secret national security facility.

114
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,360
Mission:

115
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,520
Investigate threat
of extraterrestrial attack...

116
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,640
...cleverly disguised
as a cement factory.

117
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,280
General Luft, welcome.

118
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm on a schedule.
What have you got?

119
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,280
Hard evidence.

120
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,200
We finally got them.

121
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,240
- Rentro.
- Yes, sir?

122
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,680
The remote.

123
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,760
The goat?

124
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,120
The remote.

125
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,480
The remote.
I thought he said, "The goat."

126
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,360
Over the past few months...

127
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,640
...we have received
some unusual communications.

128
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,080
Communications, sir,
that are not of this Earth.

129
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,360
- Really?
- Incoming.

130
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,520
Sorry about that, general.
Here's your remote.

131
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,200
Thank you, Rentro.

132
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,560
We believe that aliens are using
a contact on Earth...

133
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,800
...to plan their invasion.

134
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,320
Now, this same message,
"R U there"...

135
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,480
...has appeared all over the world.

136
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,280
We've been lucky enough to capture
these instances on film.

137
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
The pyramid at Giza.

138
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,520
Stonehenge.

139
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Okay, now this one says...

140
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,600
..."R U three," but we believe that
to be a simple spelling error.

141
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,320
This could be vandalism,
a practical joke.

142
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,240
Now, you see that?

143
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,520
That's what I said, general.
These photos are...

144
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,120
I'll just be over here then.

145
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,560
Right this way, general.

146
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,320
When I plotted
these anomalies sequentially...

147
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,640
...a pattern emerged.

148
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,000
A spiral.

149
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,680
Do you see the spiral?

150
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,440
Sir, they are out there.
They are coming here.

151
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,240
Do you have any idea
what you have here, Singer?

152
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,960
Sir, I have an inkling.

153
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Bubkes.

154
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,720
- Bubkes?
- Good day.

155
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,040
But, sir, we have to take action now.

156
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,960
I hired you to find me an alien.

157
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,040
And you bring me doctored photos
and a spiral.

158
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,320
You are on thin ice, boy.

159
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,120
I gotta hand it to you, sir.

160
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,680
I thought your presentation
was just wonderful.

161
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,480
Yeah.

162
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,360
Whoop, there it is.

163
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,080
Roberta. Dolores.

164
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,600
Shannanay.

165
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,960
Yo, Kerm,
what should I do with the bills?

166
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,760
- Just leave them inside.
- All right.

167
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,160
Gonzo, do you want your new issue
of Insanity Fair?

168
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,320
No, I'll get it later.

169
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,280
What is he doing up there?

170
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,320
His breakfast cereal told him
to sit on the roof.

171
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,720
Talk about whole-grain and nuts.

172
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Cool.

173
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,280
Hey, yeah.

174
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,080
Cool.

175
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,840
This could be painful.

176
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,680
It is. It is.

177
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,400
- Gonzo! Mr. Gonzo.
- Mr. Gonzo.

178
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,080
Greetings, Mr. Gonzo. Greetings!

179
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,400
What are you guys? Space fish?

180
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,760
We are cosmic knowledge fish.
We know many, many things.

181
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,160
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

182
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,000
Mr. Gonzo, your people have
been trying to reach you.

183
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,960
My people? Are they fish too?

184
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,520
No, no, no.

185
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,040
We're not the same as you.

186
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,200
We are highly evolved beings.

187
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,520
Now, if...

188
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,200
What was I saying?

189
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,480
My people?

190
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,600
- Oh, yes.
- Excellent.

191
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,760
You must mow the lawn if you wish
to find what you seek.

192
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,520
I should mow the lawn?

193
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,680
A lawn that is cut
in your own words, Gonzo.

194
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,760
A message that can be seen
from space.

195
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,000
- Space!
- So trim it well.

196
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,880
Goodbye, Gonzo.
And may the fish be with you.

197
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,320
Thanks, guys,
for the cosmic knowledge.

198
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,880
- Goodbye, Mr. Gonzo.
- Bye! Goodbye!

199
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,400
That's it!

200
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,800
Come on, Rizzo. Time to bet, okay.

201
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,520
All right, prawn cracker.
I'll see your Maryland crab cakes...

202
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,800
...and I'll raise you
a 1958 cheddar cheese...

203
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,360
...never been sniffed.

204
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,000
- Crab cakes and cheese?
- Can't beat that.

205
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,600
Hey, guys!

206
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,800
The cosmic fish have spoken to me.

207
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm from outer space!

208
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,920
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

209
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,680
- Pepe, are you in or out?
- I'm in.

210
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,120
I'm an alien!

211
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
You been tap-dancing
on the barbecue?

212
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,240
No, no, Rizzo. I'm just fine.

213
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,360
My cards!

214
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,680
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!
Not my cards.

215
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,560
Oh, no, no, no.

216
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,640
Gonzo, are you sure you're okay?

217
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,080
Yeah, absolutely.
But I have to respond.

218
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,640
Gotta make contact.

219
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,360
- Where's he going with those keys?
- Who cares? Flying saucer, maybe.

220
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,120
Dos deuces.

221
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,360
The prawn cracker wins.

222
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,760
Pair of twos! I swear
I had four aces. I really did!

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,280
You got to know when to hold it

224
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,480
No, no, no!

225
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,400
Know when to fold it
Know when to walk...

226
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,160
Just a few things for today, sir.

227
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,160
Let's see. Here's a winner.
Your Platinum Buns workout tape.

228
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,480
And let's see...

229
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,720
That new satellite photo is here...

230
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,000
...my Captain Kangaroo pajamas...
- What?

231
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,680
What satellite photo?

232
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,560
"I am here."

233
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,640
Mowed in the lawn.

234
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
Who did this?

235
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,040
- This is not good.
- No.

236
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,440
Poor guy. He's hallucinating.

237
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,400
Getting weird messages.

238
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,640
Hearing things.

239
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,240
He listens to voices
and does what they say.

240
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,160
Hold your horseshoes.

241
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,680
I think I've got an idea.

242
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,120
You're scary.

243
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,760
I have to call Luft.

244
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,120
Wait. Careful.

245
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
- Careful.
- Baby steps.

246
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,200
Baby steps.

247
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,640
- We need more evidence.
- More evidence.

248
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,160
- Remember, we're just watching.
- Watching.

249
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,520
- And waiting.
- Waiting.

250
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,120
Build it and we will come.

251
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,440
Build what?

252
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,000
Build a Jacuzzi...

253
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,400
...and we will come, okay.

254
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm up. I'm up.

255
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
Must build Jacuzzi.

256
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,120
Well done, pal.

257
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,600
Put a little more paprika
on those, okay? Thank you.

258
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,160
Well, that's everything.

259
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,560
- He built it.
- And we came.

260
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,760
All right, now. Remember, I built
this new Jacuzzi for my alien family...

261
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,760
...so no eating in the spa.

262
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,360
We gotta tell him the truth, Pepe.

263
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,840
You tell him
and I will smack you.

264
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,680
I will smack you like
a bad, bad donkey, okay.

265
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,720
- Sal.
- Yeah, Johnny.

266
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,320
There are no cannolis here.

267
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Yeah, but try this cake.
This is a beauty.

268
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,560
That is nice. Would you...?
Gonzo!

269
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,680
Go easy on the buffet, fellas.
I just want...

270
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,200
Who cut the cake? Who cut the cake?

271
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
- Who cut it?
- What? Look at that.

272
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,560
- Who cut this cake?
- That's awful, they would've...

273
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,080
I can't believe it. The guests
of honor aren't even here yet.

274
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,400
- Hey, great party.
- Yeah.

275
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,720
I just wish they'd get here.

276
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,640
Hey, you! Did you cut Gonzo's cake?

277
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,800
I wonder if there really is life
on other planets.

278
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,320
What do you care?
You don't have a life on this planet.

279
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,480
Earth, are you ready?
The Galaxy Channel presents...

280
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,960
...UFO Mania Live, with
close-encounter expert Shelley Snipes.

281
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,160
Hello, I'm Shelley Snipes.
Coming up on UFO Mania Live...

282
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,680
...I'll be taking a hard look
at some compelling new data.

283
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,200
Have you seen something in the sky
but were afraid to talk about it?

284
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,120
I don't understand why
they didn't show up last night.

285
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,280
Well, perhaps we can
be of assistance.

286
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,160
I think we can help you contact
your alien brethren...

287
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,160
...by boosting your newly enhanced
conductivity.

288
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,800
Okay, Beakie. Let her rip.

289
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,880
Wait a minute.
I think I'm picking up a signal.

290
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,800
If you've had contact
with an alien...

291
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,040
...or if you are an alien
and want to tell your story...

292
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,240
...write to us or come to our studio.

293
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Come to our studio
at 6577 Broadcast Lane now.

294
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,440
The mother ship is calling me home!

295
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,160
Thanks, guys.

296
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,160
The mother ship! It worked.
The mother ship!

297
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Beaker?

298
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,280
You said you going to tell him, okay.

299
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,960
Pepe, the Jacuzzi thing was your idea,
and you have to tell him.

300
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,560
Sí, I will tell him, okay.

301
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,760
- They're calling me!
- Here he comes.

302
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,800
- Hey, Gonzo.
- I can't talk now, guys.

303
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,560
- You should've told him.
- I wasn't supposed to!

304
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,120
- You said you'd tell him.
- I said, you! I meant you.

305
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,400
Hi, guys. I'm here.

306
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,440
I'll just leave the tractor
here in front, okay?

307
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,760
And that's the way it is.

308
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,560
This is Miss Piggy saying
good night, and have a great...

309
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,960
Hey! Where's my coffee?

310
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,240
Coming! Coming! Coming!

311
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,560
- I'll take one.
- In a minute.

312
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,680
- Light, no sugar.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,120
Shelley's stuck at the airport.
She won't make it on time.

314
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,520
Okay, I am not gonna panic.
Who am I kidding? Yes, I am.

315
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,440
No, I'm not.

316
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,600
Okay, I'm panicking. Who can we
possibly get at the last minute? Who?

317
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,120
Cappuccino?

318
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,520
- Stand by, everybody.
- Roll tape, please!

319
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,520
And cue I.D.

320
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,080
We're on in
five, four, three, two...

321
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,960
Look! It's Piggy's new show.

322
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,000
Read. Read!

323
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,560
"Hello again. I'm Shelley Snipes.

324
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,200
Today on UFO Mania,
flying saucers...

325
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,760
...and their extraterrestrial pilots."

326
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,680
- Wish I could find my pants.
- You should come to see this.

327
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,000
"I'm sure you've often wondered...

328
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,000
...what might those alien creatures
look like?"

329
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,040
People of Earth, do not be alarmed.

330
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,200
My message will be brief.

331
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,320
- I am Gonzo.
- Gonzo?

332
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,960
- Piggy?
- I don't have a Gonzo.

333
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,160
There seems to be some mistake.

334
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,440
Dang!
You better get down there, Kerm.

335
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,240
Relax. No one
is going anywhere, okay?

336
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,000
You see, I was contacted through
my breakfast cereal...

337
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,520
...and it was confirmed
to me by the cosmic fish...

338
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,560
...that I am definitely
from outer space.

339
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,400
So you wanna go now
or wait for the commercial?

340
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,600
Now. Come on.

341
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,160
What are you doing here?

342
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,720
I'm making contact.
What are you doing?

343
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,400
Interview him.

344
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,520
I'm interviewing...
I'm interviewing you!

345
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,600
Great! What would you like to know?

346
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,640
The whole tearful tale
of your inner struggle, Gonzo.

347
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,280
I want my people to know I've received
their messages, and my response is:

348
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,720
"I am here."

349
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,400
Bingo.

350
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm at 44 Bronson Lane,
and I can't wait to meet you.

351
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,560
And I can't wait to meet you.

352
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,240
Me too. He's very charismatic,
don't you think?

353
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,400
Freeze that!

354
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,160
- I want him here and I want him now.
- Yes, sir.

355
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,600
So you're our fancy little landscaper.

356
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,680
We're gonna take a break.

357
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,360
Yes. We are going to pause here,
and we'll be right back with Gonzo...

358
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,280
...the geek who fell to Earth...

359
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,960
...with moi, Miss...
- And we're out.

360
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,080
Ninety seconds, folks.

361
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,160
Now that is TV.

362
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,000
The phones are lighting up like Vegas.
What power, what heat. You're a hit!

363
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,240
Thank you.

364
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
Not you. Him.

365
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,520
- Me?
- You've got it.

366
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,360
Sure wish we could find a cure.

367
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,880
- Rizzo?
- Gonzo?

368
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,160
- Kermie?
- Piggy?

369
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,360
What's going on?

370
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,960
Listen, aren't you taking
this alien thing a little too far?

371
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,560
Kermit, I realize that it may be hard
for you to accept me as an alien...

372
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,760
...but I didn't choose to be one.

373
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,400
Well, I've always had
alien tendencies.

374
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,800
This just makes sense.

375
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,320
Beautiful, big G.

376
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,720
- I see a follow-up episode here.
- Me too.

377
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,080
"The Alien in My Life."
A Miss Piggy special report.

378
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,960
What are you talking about?
You're the coffee pig.

379
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,480
Kermit, he's such a joker.

380
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,320
We'll take this from here.

381
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,080
We're with the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Aliens.

382
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,480
We feel your pain, Gonzo.

383
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,920
They feel my pain.

384
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,280
I got a paper cut that's a doozy.
You feel my pain too?

385
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,080
Can you help me make contact
with my alien tribe?

386
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,760
Yes, we can, Gonzo.

387
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,480
Somebody believes me.
Come on, fellas.

388
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
Take me to my leader.

389
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,520
But, but... Gonzo.

390
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,360
I don't like the look of them.
This rat smells a rat.

391
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,400
The limo's right this way.

392
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,200
Did he say limo?
Wait, I'm his translator.

393
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,600
Wait!
You know this Gonzo, right?

394
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,280
- If the price is right.
- The price?

395
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Look.

396
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,440
I deliver Gonzo's exclusive
life story, okay...

397
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,240
...if you make moi
your new anchorwoman.

398
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,040
We're back in 15 seconds.

399
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,040
- What about Shelley?
- Shelley, shmelly.

400
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,840
- Yes, yes! Go.
- All right!

401
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,240
Excuse me.

402
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,720
Excuse me. Hey, studmuffin, hold it.

403
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,120
I'll deal with her.

404
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,520
You'll deal with moi?

405
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,400
Look, chumpo, I'm just trying to
get a story.

406
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,000
How about this story?

407
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,720
It's about a big bad wolf
and a little pig.

408
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,480
No, that's three pigs, okay?

409
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,160
Not in this version.

410
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,120
Wait a minute. You're not part of
that alien-protection agency.

411
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,640
Who are you?
Where are you taking Gonzo?

412
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,560
I'm impressed.

413
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,480
Black belt, third degree.

414
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,040
Platinum belt,
with an unlimited line of credit.

415
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,760
I like this party.

416
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,320
Tough guy. Tough guy!

417
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Come on. Show me! Show me!

418
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,320
Look! Cindy Crawford.

419
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,840
Where have you been all my life?

420
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:11,080
Is that all you got?

421
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,040
Not the noogie!

422
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,040
Mama!

423
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,720
Gonzo, Gonzo, Gonzo!

424
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,320
What the hey?

425
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,080
Gonzo, Gonzo, Gonzo!

426
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,000
There are no aliens here.

427
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,480
Only good, old-fashioned,
hard-working Americans.

428
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,520
Good grief.

429
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,960
Now get off my Kentucky bluegrass.

430
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,080
Look! It's a little green man.

431
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,880
Excuse me, but what are
all you people doing here?

432
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,400
We were drawn here by the alien.

433
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,200
That's all I know.

434
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,560
So let me get this straight now.

435
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,040
This government agency,
C.O.V.N.E.T., has abducted Gonzo...

436
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,320
...and taken him
to its top-secret facility?

437
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,080
Yes, Miss Piggy.

438
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,720
Thank you.
You've been most helpful.

439
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,560
At last! A real story.

440
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,240
Intrigue, danger, new outfits.

441
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,120
And it's mine, mine, mine!
All mine!

442
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,720
Come on. Please. You think
Ted Koppel never gets excited?

443
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,120
So this is the car that
takes us to the limo, right?

444
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,000
Somebody should look
at those shocks.

445
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,160
At least they carried our stuff.
Don't hold your breath for a tip.

446
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,800
As ambassador of Earth...

447
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,320
...I welcome you.

448
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,440
I'm Edgar...

449
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,440
...but I want you to call me Ed.

450
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,000
That's Ed.

451
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,440
And it's an honor
to meet you, Mr. Gonzo.

452
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,240
Yeah. Me too.

453
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,840
Hors d'oeuvres!

454
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,120
Please...

455
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,000
...won't you sit?

456
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
Thanks.

457
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,680
Careful, careful.
You'll get gas.

458
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,960
So when do we begin, Ed?
I'm very excited about all this.

459
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,000
Me too, my friend.

460
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,760
- Me too.
- Yeah.

461
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,400
Kermie, Kermie, Kermie!

462
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,840
Kermie! Yes!

463
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,880
Kermie! Everybody!

464
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,200
Come here.

465
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,840
Listen, everyone, listen.
I've got great news.

466
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,480
Gonzo has been kidnapped
by the government...

467
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,280
...and it could be
a life-threatening situation!

468
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,040
How can that be great news?

469
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Because...

470
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,600
...I've got the story!
I've got the story!

471
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,720
I need to change. Something that
says journalistic integrity.

472
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,120
- I've gotta pee.
- Oh, brother.

473
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,560
What are we gonna do?

474
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,440
Okay, guys, it's up to us.

475
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,680
We have to save Gonzo from
a whole army of government agents.

476
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,640
Well, I have a joke book.

477
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,400
Drumsticks! Drumsticks!

478
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
I have some loose Jell-O, okay.

479
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,680
Okay. Well, that settles that.

480
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,040
In circumstances like this,
there's only one place to turn.

481
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,320
- What do you got, Bunsen?
- There you are.

482
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,840
Well, Mr. Kermit, here at Muppet Labs,
we've come up with many devices...

483
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
...that should aid you
in your covert operations.

484
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,840
Excellent.

485
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
This seemingly ordinary
rubber ducky...

486
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,120
...actually contains
invisibility spray.

487
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,240
However, the effect is,
sadly, temporary.

488
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,000
The old rubber-ducky-with-
invisibility-spray trick. Check.

489
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,560
And, Beaker, if you would.

490
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,240
Here is something that
we're very excited about.

491
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,560
"Door in a jar"?

492
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,480
That's absolutely right, Beakie.

493
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,080
All you do is open up the jar...

494
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,320
...fling the contents
onto the wall, and poof!

495
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,720
Instant door.

496
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,760
What is this?
A secret communication device?

497
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,160
That's Scotch tape.
Useful if something tears.

498
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,960
And what do you have for moi?

499
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,520
Well, Miss Piggy, for you
we have Muppet Labs Mind Mist.

500
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,760
Simply spray it on the subject...

501
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,120
...and they will obey
your every command.

502
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,920
I dou...

503
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,480
I doubt I'll need any.

504
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,200
Okay, guys. Let's go get Gonzo.

505
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,880
Yeah. Come on.

506
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,960
- We'll find him, okay.
- Gonzo. Gonzo. Gonzo.

507
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,280
Yeah!

508
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,760
I've been looking for
something like you...

509
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,680
...all my life.

510
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,200
And now, at last, my search...

511
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,040
...has come to an end.

512
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,360
May I?

513
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,480
Before you answer,
you better be clear...

514
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,120
...on the final destination
of that finger.

515
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,960
Thanks.

516
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,480
No nostrils.

517
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,280
How do you smell?

518
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,000
Awful. Trust me, I'm his roommate.

519
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,280
That's a killer!

520
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,280
Don't...

521
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,960
...laugh...

522
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,360
...at me!

523
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,200
I hope I'm not imposing, but I thought
you were just great on TV.

524
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,680
Could I get your autograph?

525
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,240
- Rentro?
- Yes, sir?

526
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,480
It's not a good time.

527
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,160
This is probably not a good time.

528
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,120
Forgive me my earthly manners.

529
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,280
But do you have any idea
what it's like...

530
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,640
...to be laughed at?

531
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
Sure I do.

532
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,000
To be called names like "wacko"?

533
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,720
- And "freak boy"?
- Oh, yeah.

534
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,440
And "paranoid delusional
psychopath"?

535
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,560
Got me there.

536
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,840
To feel...

537
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,280
...completely alone
in this world?

538
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,200
I think we're starting to get
the general idea there, Ed.

539
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,360
It's wrestling legend
Hollywood Hulk Hogan?

540
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Have the rat sent down
to Dr. Tucker for some tests.

541
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,520
Tests? But I haven't studied.
I don't even have a number-two pencil!

542
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,640
This is for
all my NWO-ites out there.

543
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,880
I will continue to dominate wrestling.

544
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,480
I'll make your back crack, your knees
freeze and your liver quiver.

545
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,800
I will continue to put so much pain
on you, you'll become my "painiac."

546
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,240
Hollywood.

547
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,640
Would you mind? The rat.

548
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,840
Oh, yeah.

549
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,040
- Where you going with my friend?
- What'll your fans think?

550
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,200
Hey, what you gonna do?
I'm a bad guy now.

551
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,720
Gonzo! Gonzo, help me! No, no!

552
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,200
Rizzo!

553
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,360
He's going to be fine.

554
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Yo.

555
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,560
How you doing? I'm Bubba.

556
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,320
Hey. Rizzo. Nice to meet you.

557
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,240
Nice to meet you.
How'd you like to meet the boys?

558
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,600
Sure.

559
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,680
Up there, that's Fast Eddie,
harmonica extraordinaire.

560
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,640
- How you doing, Ed?
- Well, I ain't dead.

561
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,560
- Over here's Troy.
- Yeah, hi.

562
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,960
This back here, that's Shakes.

563
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,200
Hi. Hello. How you doing? Welcome.

564
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,240
They're doing a new
caffeine substitute on him.

565
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,760
That's the Birdman.

566
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,360
Where are you? Gladys?

567
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,600
He don't bother nobody.
Been here forever.

568
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,160
Gladys! Come on,
the guys are watching.

569
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,040
He just likes to hang out
with his birds. Know what I mean?

570
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,680
So that about does it for all
of us here at Medical Research.

571
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,240
- Medical Research?
- Yeah.

572
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
But that would mean we're...

573
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,760
...lab rats!

574
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,800
Gonzo, get me out of here!

575
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,960
Now, Mr. Gonzo.

576
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,720
What can you tell me about these?

577
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,280
They really have been
looking for me.

578
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,400
- And they are coming to Earth?
- I don't know.

579
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,680
- How many are there?
- I don't know.

580
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,520
When will they be here?

581
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,000
And don't you dare tell me...

582
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,160
...that you don't know.

583
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,640
I know not?

584
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,360
But maybe I could find out?

585
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,400
Could you?

586
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,520
Okay.

587
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,120
Well!

588
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,560
Okay, then.
I'll keep in touch. Thanks.

589
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,560
So back to the limo?

590
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,480
It's a shame, really.

591
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,280
I really need that information.

592
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,600
So I'm afraid
we'll have to perform...

593
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,440
...an invasive quadra-lobal
brain probe on you...

594
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,720
...and pluck it from your head.

595
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,960
The information?

596
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
- No, your brain. Take him away.
- What?

597
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,240
My brain?
But just a second. I...

598
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
- Where are you taking me?
- Rentro, get General Luft.

599
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,240
I need my brain!
I need my brain!

600
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,800
Fozzie, tell me again.
Why are we doing this?

601
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,680
To save Gonzo.

602
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,960
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

603
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,720
Right. Because Gonzo's one of us.

604
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,120
No matter what happens, no matter
what obstacles we face...

605
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,040
...we never forget one of our own.

606
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,800
- I love it when you take charge.
- Hey!

607
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,280
We left Bunsen and Beaker
back at the gas station.

608
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay. Well...

609
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,240
From now on,
no matter what happens...

610
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,480
...we never forget one of our own.

611
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,760
That's right.

612
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,600
Cheese Twiddle?

613
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,240
Is this movie time or something?

614
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,280
So you're the new guy.

615
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,200
From this moment on, if I say
you're hungry, you eat.

616
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,880
If I say you're sleepy...

617
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,160
I eat?

618
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Oh, you shouldn't have...

619
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,600
Well, well, well.
We got a funny boy here.

620
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,240
- Is that bad?
- Very bad.

621
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,800
It looks like funny boy's
going to the maze.

622
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,040
Since we don't want funny boy
to get lonely...

623
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,400
...you'll all do time
in the maze.

624
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

625
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,920
See, no one's ever escaped
from the maze, funny boy.

626
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,240
Even if you did,
it's four feet to the ground...

627
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,440
...12 feet to the door
and four feet to the doorknob.

628
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,680
- That's 18 feet.
- Twenty.

629
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,320
Funny thing about doorknobs:
Rats can't turn them.

630
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
No opposable thumb.

631
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,320
This is ridiculous.

632
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,400
Hey, Riz, watch out
for them red circles.

633
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,280
Yeah? What's wrong with the red...?

634
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,480
Nobody ever listens.

635
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,200
Red circles. Right.

636
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,200
Now let me see.

637
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,160
Cheese, rat poison.
Cheese, rat poison.

638
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,200
What do you guys think, I'm crazy?
This is a no-brainer.

639
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,240
This ain't so bad.
A little breezy. Oh, boy.

640
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,360
Auntie Em, Auntie Em, it's a twister!

641
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,600
This is just like
one of those carny rides.

642
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,240
You just gotta hang on, and at the end
I get some cotton candy.

643
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,800
I'm gonna hurl!

644
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,640
You're just trying
to play mind games here.

645
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,840
But I know the cheese is safe...

646
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,640
...because you think I'm going
for the poison, right?

647
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,040
Room service.

648
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Hey there, little fella.
How you doing?

649
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,880
While they're warming up the brain
sucker, I brought you a sandwich.

650
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,240
And I cut off the crusts there
for you. There you go.

651
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,440
Gee, that's nice. Thanks.

652
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,400
Anything for a celebrity.

653
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,360
Hey. Do you like jalapeños?

654
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,600
- Sure.
- Okay.

655
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,840
Jalapeños
Jalapeños

656
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,720
Hey, mopey!

657
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,120
- Who said that?
- I did.

658
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,960
But you're just a sandwich.

659
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,280
I'm channeling my voice through
this sandwich to deliver this message.

660
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,440
Great! What's the message?

661
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,600
We arrive at midnight tonight.

662
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,760
Really? And do all of you
look like sandwiches?

663
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,080
- Forget about the sandwich!
- I'm sorry.

664
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,280
Jalapeños, jalapeños
Getting my friend some jalapeños

665
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,360
So here's the plan:
We're landing at your house.

666
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,480
No, no, wait.
Those guys know where I live.

667
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,360
And they're not the best
examples of earthlings.

668
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,200
Gosh, where else can we land?

669
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,240
Let's see...
I know! At the beach.

670
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,720
Go to Cape Doom.
Just look for the lighthouse.

671
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,560
The lighthouse at Cape Doom it is.

672
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,880
Oh, boy. I didn't hear that.
I didn't hear that.

673
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,920
This is great.
But how do I get out of here?

674
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,600
Hey, I'm just a sandwich.

675
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,320
Some things you gotta
figure out for yourself.

676
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,800
By the way, you go ahead
and eat me now.

677
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,040
You're gonna need the energy.

678
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,760
- But won't that hurt?
- No, it's fine. I'm going away now.

679
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,440
- Cape Doom, right?
- Yes, Cape Doom.

680
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,240
Are you there?

681
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,400
Hello? Hello?

682
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,720
Just a little further up.

683
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,160
- Stop, Fozzie. Stop here. Fozzie.
- That's it.

684
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,560
Sorry.

685
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,480
Animal!

686
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,600
Sorry.

687
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,800
Stand back, boys.
This is a job for a woman.

688
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,680
Woman. Woman. Wo...

689
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,800
Hello.

690
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,000
What's a nice man like you doing
in a guardhouse like this?

691
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,520
I'm buffalo hunting.
What's it look like I'm doing?

692
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,000
This is a restricted area.
You gotta go.

693
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
Oh, no.

694
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,000
Look deeply into my eyes
and tell me you want me to go.

695
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,280
I want you to go.

696
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,640
Understand?

697
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,320
Now!

698
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,800
Okay.

699
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,240
I thought I...

700
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
What was I saying?

701
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,320
You were saying you were
going to open the gate.

702
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,640
Open the gate.

703
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,720
Of course, open the gate.
Come on in. Welcome!

704
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,760
- Come on, guys!
- Oh, boy.

705
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,640
Tell me I'm beautiful, sweetheart.

706
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,880
You are beautiful, sweetheart.

707
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,560
Thank you.

708
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,560
He fell on you
like a ton of bricks, okay.

709
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,600
Have a nice time.

710
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,680
- I like your tie. Very nice.
- Thank you.

711
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,560
- So long.
- Bye-bye!

712
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,320
Bye-bye.

713
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,560
What a handsome family.

714
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,600
Hey, rodents.

715
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,720
You know the cheese I promised you...

716
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,200
...after you ran that maze
and took those tests?

717
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,880
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,160
It was delicious.

719
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,160
No cheese?

720
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,520
All right! That does it!

721
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,320
We're busting out of this joint, boys.

722
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,240
Riz, even if we got over the wall,
we couldn't turn the doorknob.

723
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,480
- Yeah.
- Who needs doorknobs?

724
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

725
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,640
Very nice.

726
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,040
He likes it!

727
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,760
Guys, we gotta get through that door.

728
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,480
Should we just ask permission from
those nice men with the rifles?

729
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,120
Fozzie, those are the bad guys.

730
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,480
All right.
It's time to get invisible.

731
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,360
Fozzie, get the duck.

732
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,840
- Yes, sir.
- Duckie!

733
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,120
Here goes.

734
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,560
- I look thinner.
- Now spray yourself.

735
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,440
Okay.

736
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,120
Hey, I like this.

737
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,280
- All right, lose the duck.
- Yes, sir.

738
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,320
Listen up, guys. This stuff
doesn't last long, so let's go.

739
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,960
- Let's go.
- Yes, yes!

740
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,080
- You're squashing me.
- Sorry, Kermie.

741
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,240
Come on.
I will help you up, okay.

742
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,760
Kermit, you're so soft and plump.

743
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,600
You got one second to get
your hands off me, shrimp.

744
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,080
Sorry, Piggy.

745
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,360
Come on.

746
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,760
I have to go to the little bear's room.

747
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,480
Oh, Fozzie.

748
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,440
Smoking is very bad for you, okay.

749
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,800
Bob...

750
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,520
...didn't know you cared.

751
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,720
Paging Dr. Van Neuter. Please
report to Alien Surgery number five.

752
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,560
Hello.

753
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,680
I'm Dr. Van Neuter.

754
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,960
I'll be your brain surgeon today,
if you don't mind.

755
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,240
Get it? "Brain surgeon"? "Mind"?

756
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,520
Feeling a little nervous, are we?

757
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,080
Of course I'm nervous.

758
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,080
Everyone is before having
their brain sucked out.

759
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,320
Now, don't you go away.

760
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,240
Okay, Kermit. I'm ready.

761
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,080
Fozzie, tell me
you didn't wash your hands.

762
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,280
Of course I did.
Mom said, "Always wash your hands."

763
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,080
Not when you're wearing
invisibility spray!

764
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,840
Mom said, "No exceptions."

765
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,680
Never, ever.

766
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,080
What the...? Stop! You!

767
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,680
Hands up!

768
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,080
All right, remain calm.

769
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,680
I'm gonna have to take
you two into custody.

770
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,520
Wait. Let me explain, lady.

771
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,360
- No. Wait a minute. Where...?
- Lady, can I...? Let me explain.

772
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,120
Where are your forearms?

773
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,320
Woman!

774
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,840
Animal! Animal, get back here!

775
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,600
- Woman! Woman! Woman!
- Animal!

776
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,680
Give me a second to think.
He doesn't seem to be on this floor.

777
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,280
I should go change, okay.

778
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,600
Come on, everybody.
We need to find better cover.

779
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,480
Just up ahead here,
General Luft, sir.

780
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,280
There we go.

781
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,120
This is our new
retinal scanner, general.

782
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,080
- General Luft, sir.
- This had better be good.

783
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,560
Come on, let's go.

784
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,280
Hey, Riz. Where's Riz?
Where you going?

785
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,960
Listen. You guys go ahead.
I gotta go find my friend.

786
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,480
What? You could get caught.
What are you, nuts?

787
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,680
I guess I'll take my chances.

788
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,520
It was nice meeting you guys.
See you later.

789
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,640
So long, Riz.

790
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,840
Bye, Rizzo. Good luck.

791
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,880
Kid's got moxie.

792
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,320
What is moxie?

793
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,360
Let's see here.

794
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,320
Have you ever experienced
any achiness in your tentacles?

795
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,720
I don't have tentacles.

796
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,520
Good, no achy tentacles. Good.

797
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,760
- Head ever come off?
- No, I don't think so.

798
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,680
Good, good, good.

799
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,120
- Any gingivitis?
- No.

800
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,360
Great.

801
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,800
How about that beaky thing you've got
there, ever had problems with that?

802
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,560
Itching, swelling, flaking?

803
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,200
- Some flaking a couple years ago...
- Who cares?

804
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,280
It's showtime!

805
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,120
- Here we go.
- Oh, brother.

806
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,120
Excellent, excellent.

807
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,960
What's that thing?

808
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,920
I don't know. Here we go.
Here we go.

809
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,920
- Just stay like that.
- Okay.

810
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,520
This way.

811
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,520
Whose bright idea was this, anyway?

812
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,120
- Which way, Kermit?
- Kermin! Kermin!

813
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,400
This way.

814
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,720
I can't breathe!

815
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,920
Come on.

816
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,360
- Here we go.
- Wait, wait.

817
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,000
What is it?

818
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,080
Are you sure
this is covered by my HMO?

819
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,080
Good question. I'll check.

820
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,200
Gonzo.

821
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,520
Rizzo. You're alive.
Where have you been?

822
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,240
You don't want to know. Sit tight
while I chew through these straps.

823
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,520
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

824
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,440
Good news. You're covered
with a $10 co-pay.

825
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,040
Okay, hold still.

826
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,360
And remember, if you experience any
unpleasantness, please let me know.

827
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,600
I'd hate to miss it.

828
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,440
- Do you mind?
- Excuse me.

829
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,560
Wait!

830
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,440
Oh, good Lord! A rat!
I hate rats!

831
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,120
Then today ain't your lucky day, doc.

832
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,360
- Ready for an operation?
- A little experiment.

833
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,080
Forward, Piggy. Forward.

834
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,000
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

835
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,400
Doctor.

836
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,640
- Just a couple of doctors.
- Doctors in the hallway.

837
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,240
That was close.

838
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,520
- To the right, Fozzie.
- Forward, Piggy.

839
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,160
Too fast, too fast.
The door. Stop!

840
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,440
What in the world?

841
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,840
This is big, general. I think
we should notify the president.

842
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,760
I'll be the judge of that.

843
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,280
As always, sir.

844
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,480
No, don't tickle me!

845
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,240
- What do we do?
- Will you please get me out of here?

846
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,400
No, no, no!

847
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,680
I can't breathe!

848
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,840
Hey, guys.

849
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,360
Quick, get me out of here!

850
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,840
Today, sir...

851
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,520
...we must think with a big mind.

852
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,560
Behold.

853
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,480
Irrefutable evidence
of extraterrestrial life.

854
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,240
Release me...

855
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,520
This looks worse than it is, general.

856
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,240
Obviously, the...

857
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,600
Get off of me, you vermin!

858
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,080
The alien is loose in the building.

859
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,800
But not to worry, because...

860
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,280
Don't bother.

861
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,200
You're terminated.

862
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,600
- When you say "terminated"...
- You need help, Singer!

863
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,320
Find some!

864
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,400
Well, how'd that
go for you, then? Okay?

865
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,680
So sorry I got you into this mess.
Thanks for coming to save me.

866
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,640
You can thank us once
we're out of here.

867
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,720
All right, quietly now.

868
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,640
Stop! Come back here!

869
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,400
Help! Mommy!

870
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,440
Please, please.
Listen to me.

871
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,320
You can't leave me.

872
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,240
I need you.

873
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,920
I go now.

874
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,120
Fine. Go on, go.

875
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,600
You're all alike.

876
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,520
Animals.

877
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,760
Call me.

878
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,760
Animal. Animal!

879
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,080
Come here.

880
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,960
Way to go, Romeo.
Now let's get out of here.

881
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,160
Let's go, let's go.

882
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm gonna kill somebody.

883
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,360
Now, now.
Remember, calm blue ocean.

884
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,560
You let it go.
Baby steps, remember? Baby...

885
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,560
Find the alien!

886
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,040
Now!

887
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,680
Yes, sir.

888
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,200
- Try that door.
- It won't budge!

889
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,120
Forget that door. Come on!

890
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
This way!

891
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,400
Fozzie, quick!
The door in a jar.

892
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,560
- It's right here.
- Yeah, yeah.

893
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,320
"Open jar away from face."

894
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,480
Will you please just open the jar?

895
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,560
Hurry, Fozzie.
Come on, throw it!

896
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,920
That's disappointing.

897
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,480
Perfect. Somebody knock
and see if Barbie's home.

898
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,000
Works for me.

899
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,160
What?

900
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,280
I cannot believe that
little shrimp left us behind.

901
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,040
I am not a shrimp.
I am a king prawn.

902
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,760
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

903
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,080
Hurry, hurry!

904
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,680
Keep going, everybody.
Don't look back. Run!

905
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,920
- Did you have a good time?
- Thank you.

906
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,440
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, nice man.

907
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,240
What the heck is going on?

908
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,360
- We did it!
- See that?

909
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,440
When we pull together,
we can do anything.

910
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,200
Now we can go meet my alien
brothers at Cape Doom.

911
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,440
What makes you think
that aliens are landing there?

912
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,480
Oh, a sandwich told me.

913
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,840
Oh, no.

914
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,240
I'd give it a rest there, buddy.

915
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,000
Do you mean that you guys
still don't believe me?

916
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,200
Well...

917
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,400
All right, fine. Stop the bus.
I'll get there by myself.

918
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,880
No, no. Wait, Gonzo.
Wait. Look.

919
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,680
It doesn't matter what we believe.

920
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,480
If you believe that you need
to go and meet your alien brothers...

921
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,040
...then I say...

922
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,240
Well, I say we're going to the beach.
Right, guys?

923
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,880
The beach, okay.

924
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,160
To the beach.

925
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,320
Great!

926
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,440
Beach ball! Beach ball!

927
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,320
Get the crew to Cape Doom
on the double.

928
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,480
And look, this is my exclusive,
so don't tell anyone.

929
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,680
I got it.

930
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,720
Pack it up, guys! The spaceship
is landing at Cape Doom!

931
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,200
Where is he?

932
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,040
Well, I didn't overhear anything...

933
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,880
Did I ask you
if you overheard anything?

934
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,240
No, sir.

935
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,640
Because if you did
overhear anything...

936
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,040
...I'm sure you would tell me.

937
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,640
Yes, sir.

938
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,520
Or do I have to remind you...

939
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,200
...of Mr. Jumbo's Circus Town
and Wild Animal Revue?

940
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,160
Where's he going?

941
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,440
Oh, look.

942
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,120
Sunday's half price
at the petting zoo.

943
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,160
Okay, okay!
They're going to Cape Doom.

944
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,480
Good, good.

945
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,760
Get me the subatomic
neutro-destabiliser.

946
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,480
The subatomic neutro...
The really big gun.

947
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,960
The really big gun. Yes, sir.

948
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,680
The really big gun.

949
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,200
Really big gun.

950
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,440
Clip.

951
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,920
Clip!

952
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,200
Let's head for my car.

953
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,760
Problem there, sir.

954
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,240
Remember those parking tickets
you asked me to take care of for you?

955
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,720
And I said that...

956
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,920
Oh, just say it.

957
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,720
Car's impounded.

958
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,480
We can take my company car.

959
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,400
- Fine.
- Great.

960
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,080
Sixty-six bottles of beer on the wall
Sixty-six bottles of beer

961
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,280
Excuse me.

962
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,200
Excuse me!
Can this thing go any faster?

963
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,800
I'm doing 30.

964
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,360
You want to slow down there, buddy?

965
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,280
A lot of traffic tonight, sir.
Safety first.

966
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,040
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

967
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,120
What's with all these crazy people?

968
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,080
Can I help it if moi
has such devoted fans?

969
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,120
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

970
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,160
All right, everybody, back off!

971
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,400
Make way!
Let His Royal Weirdness through.

972
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,920
Everybody be cool.

973
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,760
Stay back. Be cool, okay.

974
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,960
Get your Gonzo T-shirts right here.
Ten bucks!

975
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,040
Goodbye, Rainbow,
and stay groovy.

976
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,880
Got cold.

977
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,400
Yeah. Sure did.

978
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:19,120
Midnight. The Ione alien
stands before a naked sky.

979
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,000
The mood is tense.

980
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,320
- My hair looks great.
- What?

981
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,400
I don't believe this.

982
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,640
Shelley.

983
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,480
You backstabbing, underhanded
little coffee pig.

984
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,440
- What?
- This is my show!

985
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,640
My story, my microphone.

986
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,600
Shelley Snipes reporting.
Please ignore the little sow.

987
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,200
Disregard this woman. I...

988
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,560
What am I doing?

989
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,760
You are about to give me your job
and get everyone here coffee.

990
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,520
Oh, yes. Of course.

991
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,280
Right away.

992
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,560
I love this stuff.

993
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,160
How you doing?

994
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,760
Excuse me, buddy.

995
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,280
And a happy Halloween to you
as well.

996
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,120
It's all right. Take it easy.

997
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,560
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, it's all right?

998
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,240
You don't understand. We let
him slide, and he gave us a ride.

999
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,080
Yeah, yeah.
I love all my new rat friends now.

1000
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,280
Come on.
Who wants this next marshmallow?

1001
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,040
- Can you believe that?
- Look at that.

1002
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,040
Hey, fellas.
Look who's here over here.

1003
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,240
- Rizzo!
- Hey, buddy!

1004
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,320
It's too bad Dawson isn't here for this.

1005
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,720
Tell me about it. This whole situation
is like one of his sci-fi movies.

1006
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,080
But this is a Muppet movie.
It's much more realistic...

1007
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,400
...and romantic, okay.

1008
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,800
Right.

1009
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,320
What's your deal?
Are you an alien or something?

1010
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,920
No, baby.
Me and Gonzo are very tight.

1011
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,200
We'll be chilling
in our hot tub later on.

1012
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,000
Perhaps you'd like
to partake in the party.

1013
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,960
Geeks.

1014
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,400
All right. Don't answer right away.
We'll be here.

1015
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,240
Oh, she'll be back.

1016
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,640
One a.m.

1017
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,240
The alien is still
standing over there.

1018
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,400
My hair still looks great.

1019
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,240
One can only wonder...

1020
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,040
...what Gonzo's feeling right now.

1021
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,640
They're not coming.

1022
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,000
Maybe they're just running late.

1023
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,400
It's a no-show. It's a no-show.

1024
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,720
What?

1025
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,960
Hey, wait a second.
I believed you, man.

1026
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,080
Yeah. I stayed up all night dancing...

1027
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,840
...and didn't study for finals
because of you.

1028
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,840
I'm cold. Come on, let's go.

1029
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,080
I'm out of here.

1030
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,000
Look!

1031
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,680
Boy.

1032
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,000
They're really tiny.

1033
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,640
But tiny's not a bad thing, right?

1034
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,400
No. Tiny's good.

1035
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:35,200
Wait a minute. We came out here in the
middle of the night for a stupid egg?

1036
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,800
It could be full of chocolate, okay.

1037
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,160
Shoot it! Shoot it!

1038
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,160
Please, big boss.
I never disobeyed my mother.

1039
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,720
And I never carried the plague.
Not even once!

1040
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,240
- Are you okay, Gonzo?
- Great. Never felt better.

1041
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:41,640
Let the one who is called Gonzo
step forward.

1042
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,680
That's me!

1043
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,640
I'm Gonzo.

1044
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,360
Step a little closer.

1045
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,280
Come a little further forward.

1046
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,760
Lean into the light.

1047
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,360
There you go.
Lean in a little further.

1048
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,320
A little further.

1049
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,880
That's him!

1050
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,600
Gonzo.

1051
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,920
Many zotons ago...

1052
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,200
...you were lost to us.

1053
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,560
We've come a long way looking
for you, little brother.

1054
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,200
We know of but one way...

1055
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,600
...to express our happiness
at having found you.

1056
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,520
Now there's a party going on
Right here

1057
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,720
- Right here
- A celebration

1058
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,000
That's my family! That's my family!

1059
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:57,120
So bring your good times
And your laughter too

1060
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,440
We're gonna celebrate
Your party with you

1061
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,080
- Come on, now
- Celebration

1062
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:08,480
Let's all celebrate
And have a good time

1063
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,280
Celebration

1064
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,640
We're gonna celebrate
And have a good time

1065
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,640
It's time to come together

1066
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,360
It's up to you
What's your pleasure?

1067
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,400
Everyone around the world
Come on

1068
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,320
Celebrate good times

1069
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,720
Come on

1070
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:42,280
It's a celebration

1071
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,920
Yeah.

1072
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,600
Celebrate good times
Come on

1073
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,360
Gonzo, I want
to see you up here on the stage!

1074
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,600
- Me?
- Yeah, you, boy!

1075
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,800
Look at him go, guys.
Look at him up there!

1076
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:07,080
Celebrate good times
Come on

1077
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,080
It's the Great Gonzo!

1078
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,800
This way.

1079
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:25,840
Gonzo, it is time to take your righteous
place amongst your brothers.

1080
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,160
Thanks...

1081
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,600
Here you go.

1082
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,720
By surviving and thriving alone
on this alien planet...

1083
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,400
...you have proven
yourself audacious...

1084
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,040
...courageous and
distinctly one of a kind.

1085
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,160
We welcome you back
with our most...

1086
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,080
...ceremonious of ceremonies.

1087
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,400
What's that?

1088
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,880
We gonna blow you up, baby.

1089
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,240
Yes, yes, yes!

1090
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,040
I love these people!

1091
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,720
Coming down!

1092
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,120
Cowabunga!

1093
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,800
Oh, no!

1094
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,680
Where's he gone?

1095
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,480
He's okay! He's all right.

1096
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,760
Now, that is what I call
the Great Gonzo.

1097
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,160
It's so good to see you.

1098
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,360
Yes! Yes!

1099
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,280
Hold it!

1100
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,000
Hold it.

1101
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,200
Get out of the way, you freak.

1102
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,000
Very, very moving,
my little alien friend.

1103
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,040
But I'm afraid your timing is off.

1104
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,440
Now...

1105
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,920
...you're coming back with me...

1106
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,360
...in my cement truck.

1107
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,480
What's so funny?

1108
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,240
Don't laugh at me.

1109
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,560
Don't laugh...
All right.

1110
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,360
I'll show you laughter!

1111
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,520
No!

1112
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,920
Please load weapon.

1113
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:39,160
Please load weapon.
Please load weapon.

1114
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,440
Come on. Come on.

1115
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,720
My toe!

1116
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,400
This certainly is good!

1117
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,280
That was a close one.

1118
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,360
Not as close as you think, my friend.

1119
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,720
"Please load weapon."

1120
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,640
- We are honored to meet you.
- A most extraordinary performance.

1121
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,360
What are you talking about?

1122
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:25,000
Gonzo of Earth, who is this most
entertaining friend of yours?

1123
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,400
That's Ed.

1124
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,880
- Hi, Ed.
- Hello, Ed.

1125
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,120
- The cape.
- The cape!

1126
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,200
The cape for Ed.

1127
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,560
Ed, because of
your comic instincts...

1128
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:39,560
...we have chosen you
as ambassador to our planet.

1129
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,680
You mean
you want me to go with you?

1130
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:51,920
To boldly go where
no man has gone before?

1131
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,440
It would be our great privilege, Ed.

1132
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,760
May I call you Zongo?

1133
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,520
- Zongo.
- Zongo.

1134
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,400
To travel the stars
like a modern-day Magellan?

1135
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,960
To be up there with John Glenn...

1136
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,560
...Neil Armstrong.

1137
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,000
I think you better get going.
They're waiting for you.

1138
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,320
Run along now.

1139
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
This way, Zongo.

1140
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,480
Baby steps, sir.

1141
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,720
Baby steps.

1142
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,640
Time to beat feet.

1143
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,240
Come along, little brother.

1144
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,920
Oh, boy.

1145
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,800
This is happening so fast.

1146
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,800
Well, guys, you know...

1147
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,240
...I'm gonna miss you.
And I'll be thinking about you.

1148
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,600
Rizzo, buddy...

1149
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,000
No, no, not me.
I do not do goodbyes.

1150
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,960
Well, I just want to tell you...

1151
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,440
I just want you
to take care of yourself.

1152
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,760
Don't worry about me. I...

1153
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,320
I can always get another roommate.

1154
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,120
Oh, buddy.

1155
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,960
- Take care.
- You too.

1156
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,600
And, Kermit...

1157
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,920
...you're the best friend
any alien could ask for.

1158
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,720
We love you, Gonzo.

1159
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,120
So you'll write?

1160
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,120
Yeah, sure, I'll write.

1161
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,080
There's probably a mailbox
every couple of light-years.

1162
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,400
- Yeah.
- Adiós, Mr. Spaceman, okay.

1163
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,760
Man, you keep saying goodbye,
and you'll never get home.

1164
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,200
Oh, yeah. Home. Home.

1165
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,880
Time to go home.

1166
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,960
The stars beckon.

1167
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,400
Shall we go home?

1168
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,720
I don't think so.

1169
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,560
Gonzo?

1170
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,960
Thank you for going
to so much trouble to find me.

1171
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,640
But I can't go.

1172
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,400
I love these guys.

1173
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,960
My life is here.

1174
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,520
This is my home.

1175
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,440
If that is your decision...

1176
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,240
...then we shall abide by it.

1177
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,240
We will miss you.

1178
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,080
So good luck, Gonzo.

1179
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,440
Yes.

1180
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,600
People of Earth, later.

1181
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,000
Yes!

1182
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Oh, boy.

1183
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,760
Goodbye!

1184
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,360
You're back! You're back!

1185
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,200
People of Earth...

1186
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:23,320
...this is one small step for man...

1187
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:29,080
...and one giant step for...

1188
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,240
Forget it.

1189
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,040
What a great day.

1190
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,600
That was probably the best day
of my whole life.

1191
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,280
There's one thing
I still don't understand.

1192
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,720
What's that, Gonzo?

1193
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,480
Why did they ask me
to build a Jacuzzi?
