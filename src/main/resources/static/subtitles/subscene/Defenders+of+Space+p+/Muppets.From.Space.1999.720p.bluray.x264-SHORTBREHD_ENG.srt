1
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,788
Sorry!

2
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,522
Hey, wait for me!

3
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,775
Hold the boat!

4
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,277
I'm coming!

5
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,531
Noah! Mr. The Ark! I'm here.

6
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,243
Barely made it. I thought
you were gonna leave without...

7
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,832
Gee, Mr. Noah, sir...

8
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,668
...I'm gonna come too.

9
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,880
What are you, anyway?

10
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,548
Good question.

11
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,217
Now, technically speaking...

12
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,303
...let's say, put me down
as a "whatever."

13
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,640
What do you mean?
What is your species?

14
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,771
I don't know.
I guess there's only one of me.

15
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,859
Then you are doomed!

16
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,155
Wait. Wait!

17
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,330
Yes, sir?

18
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,290
You may need this.

19
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,420
But, but, but...

20
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:06,435
No! No! No!

21
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,605
I don't wanna be alone!

22
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,322
No, I don't wanna be alone.

23
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,200
No, no, no!

24
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,453
I don't wanna be alone!

25
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,497
You're not alone.

26
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,790
Who said that?

27
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,378
Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's the rat
who's hanging out of the window!

28
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,632
Rizzo?

29
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,802
No, it's Santa,
but I forgot my reindeer.

30
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,471
- I'm sorry, Rizzo.
- Yeah, right.

31
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,308
Boy.

32
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,476
I had that weird dream again.

33
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,439
Oh, yeah? The one with the goat and
the dwarf and the jar of peanut butter?

34
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,693
No, it was the one where...
Forget it. You wouldn't understand.

35
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,446
I'd understand.
Come on, we're roommates.

36
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,239
Hey, hey, hey.

37
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,742
I'm here for you, man.

38
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,495
Okay. It's the one where
I'm talking to this Noah guy...

39
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,957
...and he won't let me on his boat
because I'm all...

40
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,797
...alone.

41
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,176
Good night, Rizzo.

42
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,921
Morning.

43
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,235
What? Hey, man!

44
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,092
I do it all for you, ladies.

45
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,909
And scrunch.

46
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,661
Scrunch it. And right. And left.

47
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,748
And suck in those tummies, ladies!

48
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,598
That was fun. Way to get down
with your bad selves.

49
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,434
- Pass the bagel.
- Good morning, Rowlf.

50
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,603
Good morning, Bob.

51
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,731
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning.

52
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,859
Hello, little people!

53
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,029
What an absolutely splendid day!

54
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,825
How are you, Piggy?

55
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,203
Late. I start my fabulous
new job today.

56
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,540
We megastar TV journalists
have to be punctual, you know.

57
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,251
- TV journalist...?
- Gotta run. Bye, Kermie.

58
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,836
Kissie, kissie.

59
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,716
- Is breakfast over?
- No, why?

60
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,511
Because I think
the bacon just ran out.

61
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,226
The raspberry flapovers
will be out in a moment.

62
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,646
Uncle Kermit, what'll you do
now that you're on vacation?

63
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,566
Robin, as soon as I get
those housepainters started...

64
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,068
...I'm gonna kick back and relax.

65
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,196
- When will you fix the oven, okay?
- What's wrong with the oven?

66
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,576
That.

67
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,745
Popovers kaput!

68
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,957
I'll put it on the top of my list.

69
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,126
There is a menu correction, okay.

70
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,462
We will now be serving
bologna sandwiches.

71
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,757
But no bread.

72
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,052
I'm already gone.

73
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,894
Hey, Gonzo. Aren't you performing
at that bar mitzvah today?

74
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,396
Electric Mayhem's covering for me.

75
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,231
Shalom.

76
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,531
But you never miss the chance
to shoot yourself out of a cannon.

77
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,991
Something wrong?

78
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,076
- No.
- Okay.

79
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:00,539
It's just that I'm sick and tired of
being a one-of-a-kind freak, that's all.

80
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,044
Gonzo, you are not
a one-of-a-kind freak. You're a...

81
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,130
A whatever?

82
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,633
- Well, yeah.
- You see?

83
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,803
See what I mean? I don't even know
where I came from or who I am.

84
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,971
Yo, Kerm.

85
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,974
You weren't waiting for some painters,
were you?

86
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,184
Yeah.

87
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,936
- They're driving away.
- What?

88
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,105
- Animal bit one of them.
- Oh, no.

89
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,982
Wait, guys!

90
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,943
Don't let them go!

91
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,988
You know what you are, Gonzo?

92
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,408
- What?
- Distinct.

93
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,162
Hey, wait, guys! He didn't mean it!
He's just a musician!

94
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,374
Musician, musician, musician!

95
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,525
Distinct, huh?

96
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,152
More like extinct.

97
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,507
"Watch the sky"? Hey, hey!

98
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,636
Rizzo, come here. I think my Kap'n
Alphabet is sending me a message.

99
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,804
I know what you mean.

100
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,890
I had some guacamole last night,
and it's still speaking to me.

101
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,935
No, really. Look, look.
I'm not kidding.

102
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,731
Well, it was there just a second ago.

103
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,276
I swear, Rizzo.
It said, "Watch the sky."

104
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,487
Are you sure it didn't say,
"You need help"?

105
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,115
But, but...

106
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,909
Look, maybe you and your cereal
would like to be alone.

107
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,371
Oh, boy.

108
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,583
My bologna has a first name

109
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,585
It's O-S-C-A-R

110
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,884
Cool.

111
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,062
"R U there"?

112
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,776
Rizzo!

113
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,242
C.O.V.N.E.T.
Top-secret national security facility.

114
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,287
Mission:

115
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:49,625
Investigate threat
of extraterrestrial attack...

116
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,134
...cleverly disguised
as a cement factory.

117
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,972
General Luft, welcome.

118
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,974
I'm on a schedule.
What have you got?

119
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,143
Hard evidence.

120
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,145
We finally got them.

121
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,315
- Rentro.
- Yes, sir?

122
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,817
The remote.

123
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,028
The goat?

124
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,489
The remote.

125
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,992
The remote.
I thought he said, "The goat."

126
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,995
Over the past few months...

127
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,416
...we have received
some unusual communications.

128
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,002
Communications, sir,
that are not of this Earth.

129
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,337
- Really?
- Incoming.

130
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,632
Sorry about that, general.
Here's your remote.

131
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,427
Thank you, Rentro.

132
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,930
We believe that aliens are using
a contact on Earth...

133
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,266
...to plan their invasion.

134
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,936
Now, this same message,
"R U there"...

135
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,188
...has appeared all over the world.

136
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,236
We've been lucky enough to capture
these instances on film.

137
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,447
The pyramid at Giza.

138
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,742
Stonehenge.

139
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,206
Okay, now this one says...

140
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,210
..."R U three," but we believe that
to be a simple spelling error.

141
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,046
This could be vandalism,
a practical joke.

142
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,048
Now, you see that?

143
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,469
That's what I said, general.
These photos are...

144
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,222
I'll just be over here then.

145
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,724
Right this way, general.

146
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,602
When I plotted
these anomalies sequentially...

147
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,021
...a pattern emerged.

148
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,482
A spiral.

149
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,319
Do you see the spiral?

150
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,282
Sir, they are out there.
They are coming here.

151
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,244
Do you have any idea
what you have here, Singer?

152
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,038
Sir, I have an inkling.

153
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,247
Bubkes.

154
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,916
- Bubkes?
- Good day.

155
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,377
But, sir, we have to take action now.

156
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,422
I hired you to find me an alien.

157
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,676
And you bring me doctored photos
and a spiral.

158
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,096
You are on thin ice, boy.

159
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,101
I gotta hand it to you, sir.

160
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,813
I thought your presentation
was just wonderful.

161
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,904
Yeah.

162
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,950
Whoop, there it is.

163
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,871
Roberta. Dolores.

164
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,542
Shannanay.

165
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,045
Yo, Kerm,
what should I do with the bills?

166
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,965
- Just leave them inside.
- All right.

167
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,510
Gonzo, do you want your new issue
of Insanity Fair?

168
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,762
No, I'll get it later.

169
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,318
What is he doing up there?

170
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,488
His breakfast cereal told him
to sit on the roof.

171
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,991
Talk about whole-grain and nuts.

172
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,340
Cool.

173
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,027
Hey, yeah.

174
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,032
Cool.

175
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,550
This could be painful.

176
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,554
It is. It is.

177
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,476
- Gonzo! Mr. Gonzo.
- Mr. Gonzo.

178
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,270
Greetings, Mr. Gonzo. Greetings!

179
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,689
What are you guys? Space fish?

180
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,193
We are cosmic knowledge fish.
We know many, many things.

181
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,695
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

182
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,699
Mr. Gonzo, your people have
been trying to reach you.

183
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,743
My people? Are they fish too?

184
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,370
No, no, no.

185
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,954
We're not the same as you.

186
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,249
We are highly evolved beings.

187
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,626
Now, if...

188
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,378
What was I saying?

189
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,712
My people?

190
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,923
- Oh, yes.
- Excellent.

191
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,218
You must mow the lawn if you wish
to find what you seek.

192
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,053
I should mow the lawn?

193
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,348
A lawn that is cut
in your own words, Gonzo.

194
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,517
A message that can be seen
from space.

195
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,852
- Space!
- So trim it well.

196
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,898
Goodbye, Gonzo.
And may the fish be with you.

197
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,442
Thanks, guys,
for the cosmic knowledge.

198
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,154
- Goodbye, Mr. Gonzo.
- Bye! Goodbye!

199
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,465
That's it!

200
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,010
Come on, Rizzo. Time to bet, okay.

201
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,889
All right, prawn cracker.
I'll see your Maryland crab cakes...

202
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,309
...and I'll raise you
a 1958 cheddar cheese...

203
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,979
...never been sniffed.

204
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,732
- Crab cakes and cheese?
- Can't beat that.

205
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,400
Hey, guys!

206
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,694
The cosmic fish have spoken to me.

207
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,321
I'm from outer space!

208
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,990
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

209
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,825
- Pepe, are you in or out?
- I'm in.

210
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,326
I'm an alien!

211
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,495
You been tap-dancing
on the barbecue?

212
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,665
No, no, Rizzo. I'm just fine.

213
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,004
My cards!

214
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,423
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!
Not my cards.

215
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,426
Oh, no, no, no.

216
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,595
Gonzo, are you sure you're okay?

217
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,139
Yeah, absolutely.
But I have to respond.

218
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,766
Gotta make contact.

219
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,687
- Where's he going with those keys?
- Who cares? Flying saucer, maybe.

220
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,522
Dos deuces.

221
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,858
The prawn cracker wins.

222
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:34,446
Pair of twos! I swear
I had four aces. I really did!

223
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,073
You got to know when to hold it

224
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,325
No, no, no!

225
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,369
Know when to fold it
Know when to walk...

226
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,785
Just a few things for today, sir.

227
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:26,998
Let's see. Here's a winner.
Your Platinum Buns workout tape.

228
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,460
And let's see...

229
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,796
That new satellite photo is here...

230
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,173
...my Captain Kangaroo pajamas...
- What?

231
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,925
What satellite photo?

232
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,099
"I am here."

233
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,268
Mowed in the lawn.

234
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,562
Who did this?

235
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,240
- This is not good.
- No.

236
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,742
Poor guy. He's hallucinating.

237
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,786
Getting weird messages.

238
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,079
Hearing things.

239
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,790
He listens to voices
and does what they say.

240
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,792
Hold your horseshoes.

241
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,462
I think I've got an idea.

242
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,964
You're scary.

243
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,759
I have to call Luft.

244
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,220
Wait. Careful.

245
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,556
- Careful.
- Baby steps.

246
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,474
Baby steps.

247
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,019
- We need more evidence.
- More evidence.

248
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,689
- Remember, we're just watching.
- Watching.

249
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,150
- And waiting.
- Waiting.

250
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:43,074
Build it and we will come.

251
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,493
Build what?

252
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,163
Build a Jacuzzi...

253
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:51,708
...and we will come, okay.

254
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,253
I'm up. I'm up.

255
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,218
Must build Jacuzzi.

256
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,014
Well done, pal.

257
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,813
Put a little more paprika
on those, okay? Thank you.

258
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,483
Well, that's everything.

259
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,071
- He built it.
- And we came.

260
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:25,450
All right, now. Remember, I built
this new Jacuzzi for my alien family...

261
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,535
...so no eating in the spa.

262
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,289
We gotta tell him the truth, Pepe.

263
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,918
You tell him
and I will smack you.

264
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,879
I will smack you like
a bad, bad donkey, okay.

265
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,049
- Sal.
- Yeah, Johnny.

266
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,717
There are no cannolis here.

267
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,845
Yeah, but try this cake.
This is a beauty.

268
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,181
That is nice. Would you...?
Gonzo!

269
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,434
Go easy on the buffet, fellas.
I just want...

270
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,062
Who cut the cake? Who cut the cake?

271
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,314
- Who cut it?
- What? Look at that.

272
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,651
- Who cut this cake?
- That's awful, they would've...

273
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,321
I can't believe it. The guests
of honor aren't even here yet.

274
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,740
- Hey, great party.
- Yeah.

275
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,159
I just wish they'd get here.

276
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,204
Hey, you! Did you cut Gonzo's cake?

277
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,542
I wonder if there really is life
on other planets.

278
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,212
What do you care?
You don't have a life on this planet.

279
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,592
Earth, are you ready?
The Galaxy Channel presents...

280
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,264
...UFO Mania Live, with
close-encounter expert Shelley Snipes.

281
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,643
Hello, I'm Shelley Snipes.
Coming up on UFO Mania Live...

282
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,313
...I'll be taking a hard look
at some compelling new data.

283
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:42,027
Have you seen something in the sky
but were afraid to talk about it?

284
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,071
I don't understand why
they didn't show up last night.

285
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,323
Well, perhaps we can
be of assistance.

286
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,326
I think we can help you contact
your alien brethren...

287
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,455
...by boosting your newly enhanced
conductivity.

288
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,207
Okay, Beakie. Let her rip.

289
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,547
Wait a minute.
I think I'm picking up a signal.

290
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,634
If you've had contact
with an alien...

291
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,013
...or if you are an alien
and want to tell your story...

292
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,307
...write to us or come to our studio.

293
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:16,227
Come to our studio
at 6577 Broadcast Lane now.

294
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,814
The mother ship is calling me home!

295
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,650
Thanks, guys.

296
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,821
The mother ship! It worked.
The mother ship!

297
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:29,824
Beaker?

298
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,160
You said you going to tell him, okay.

299
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,997
Pepe, the Jacuzzi thing was your idea,
and you have to tell him.

300
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,665
Sí, I will tell him, okay.

301
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,959
- They're calling me!
- Here he comes.

302
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,129
- Hey, Gonzo.
- I can't talk now, guys.

303
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,007
- You should've told him.
- I wasn't supposed to!

304
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,676
- You said you'd tell him.
- I said, you! I meant you.

305
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,780
Hi, guys. I'm here.

306
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,950
I'll just leave the tractor
here in front, okay?

307
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,369
And that's the way it is.

308
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,331
This is Miss Piggy saying
good night, and have a great...

309
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,834
Hey! Where's my coffee?

310
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:26,339
Coming! Coming! Coming!

311
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,844
- I'll take one.
- In a minute.

312
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,054
- Light, no sugar.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,641
Shelley's stuck at the airport.
She won't make it on time.

314
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:40,186
Okay, I am not gonna panic.
Who am I kidding? Yes, I am.

315
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,188
No, I'm not.

316
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,526
Okay, I'm panicking. Who can we
possibly get at the last minute? Who?

317
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,196
Cappuccino?

318
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,741
- Stand by, everybody.
- Roll tape, please!

319
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,827
And cue I.D.

320
00:24:55,995 --> 00:25:00,582
We're on in
five, four, three, two...

321
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,841
Look! It's Piggy's new show.

322
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,096
Read. Read!

323
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,894
"Hello again. I'm Shelley Snipes.

324
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,732
Today on UFO Mania,
flying saucers...

325
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,401
...and their extraterrestrial pilots."

326
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,488
- Wish I could find my pants.
- You should come to see this.

327
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,908
"I'm sure you've often wondered...

328
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,036
...what might those alien creatures
look like?"

329
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,206
People of Earth, do not be alarmed.

330
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,458
My message will be brief.

331
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,711
- I am Gonzo.
- Gonzo?

332
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,464
- Piggy?
- I don't have a Gonzo.

333
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,758
There seems to be some mistake.

334
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,135
Dang!
You better get down there, Kerm.

335
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,055
Relax. No one
is going anywhere, okay?

336
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,975
You see, I was contacted through
my breakfast cereal...

337
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,603
...and it was confirmed
to me by the cosmic fish...

338
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,730
...that I am definitely
from outer space.

339
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,777
So you wanna go now
or wait for the commercial?

340
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,071
Now. Come on.

341
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,740
What are you doing here?

342
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,409
I'm making contact.
What are you doing?

343
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,161
Interview him.

344
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,414
I'm interviewing...
I'm interviewing you!

345
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,626
Great! What would you like to know?

346
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,838
The whole tearful tale
of your inner struggle, Gonzo.

347
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:35,677
I want my people to know I've received
their messages, and my response is:

348
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:40,306
"I am here."

349
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,101
Bingo.

350
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:48,815
I'm at 44 Bronson Lane,
and I can't wait to meet you.

351
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,609
And I can't wait to meet you.

352
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,404
Me too. He's very charismatic,
don't you think?

353
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,613
Freeze that!

354
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,534
- I want him here and I want him now.
- Yes, sir.

355
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:04,163
So you're our fancy little landscaper.

356
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,332
We're gonna take a break.

357
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:11,212
Yes. We are going to pause here,
and we'll be right back with Gonzo...

358
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,214
...the geek who fell to Earth...

359
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,009
...with moi, Miss...
- And we're out.

360
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,219
Ninety seconds, folks.

361
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,388
Now that is TV.

362
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:24,392
The phones are lighting up like Vegas.
What power, what heat. You're a hit!

363
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,685
Thank you.

364
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,562
Not you. Him.

365
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,105
- Me?
- You've got it.

366
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,024
Sure wish we could find a cure.

367
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,651
- Rizzo?
- Gonzo?

368
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,986
- Kermie?
- Piggy?

369
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,237
What's going on?

370
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,991
Listen, aren't you taking
this alien thing a little too far?

371
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,787
Kermit, I realize that it may be hard
for you to accept me as an alien...

372
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,081
...but I didn't choose to be one.

373
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,877
Well, I've always had
alien tendencies.

374
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,337
This just makes sense.

375
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,921
Beautiful, big G.

376
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,424
- I see a follow-up episode here.
- Me too.

377
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,927
"The Alien in My Life."
A Miss Piggy special report.

378
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,930
What are you talking about?
You're the coffee pig.

379
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,601
Kermit, he's such a joker.

380
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,519
We'll take this from here.

381
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,483
We're with the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Aliens.

382
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,942
We feel your pain, Gonzo.

383
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,444
They feel my pain.

384
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,947
I got a paper cut that's a doozy.
You feel my pain too?

385
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,867
Can you help me make contact
with my alien tribe?

386
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,619
Yes, we can, Gonzo.

387
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,455
Somebody believes me.
Come on, fellas.

388
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,915
Take me to my leader.

389
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,625
But, but... Gonzo.

390
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,586
I don't like the look of them.
This rat smells a rat.

391
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,713
The limo's right this way.

392
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,633
Did he say limo?
Wait, I'm his translator.

393
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,135
Wait!
You know this Gonzo, right?

394
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,972
- If the price is right.
- The price?

395
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,308
Look.

396
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:50,353
I deliver Gonzo's exclusive
life story, okay...

397
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,272
...if you make moi
your new anchorwoman.

398
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,192
We're back in 15 seconds.

399
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,320
- What about Shelley?
- Shelley, shmelly.

400
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,240
- Yes, yes! Go.
- All right!

401
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,828
Excuse me.

402
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,499
Excuse me. Hey, studmuffin, hold it.

403
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,001
I'll deal with her.

404
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,504
You'll deal with moi?

405
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,507
Look, chumpo, I'm just trying to
get a story.

406
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,175
How about this story?

407
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,011
It's about a big bad wolf
and a little pig.

408
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,847
No, that's three pigs, okay?

409
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,598
Not in this version.

410
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:32,770
Wait a minute. You're not part of
that alien-protection agency.

411
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,441
Who are you?
Where are you taking Gonzo?

412
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,528
I'm impressed.

413
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,701
Black belt, third degree.

414
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,498
Platinum belt,
with an unlimited line of credit.

415
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,292
I like this party.

416
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,046
Tough guy. Tough guy!

417
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,674
Come on. Show me! Show me!

418
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,217
Look! Cindy Crawford.

419
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,016
Where have you been all my life?

420
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:21,736
Is that all you got?

421
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,822
Not the noogie!

422
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,207
Mama!

423
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,001
Gonzo, Gonzo, Gonzo!

424
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,712
What the hey?

425
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,590
Gonzo, Gonzo, Gonzo!

426
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,592
There are no aliens here.

427
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,221
Only good, old-fashioned,
hard-working Americans.

428
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,348
Good grief.

429
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,892
Now get off my Kentucky bluegrass.

430
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,102
Look! It's a little green man.

431
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,107
Excuse me, but what are
all you people doing here?

432
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,778
We were drawn here by the alien.

433
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,783
That's all I know.

434
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,244
So let me get this straight now.

435
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:15,915
This government agency,
C.O.V.N.E.T., has abducted Gonzo...

436
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,292
...and taken him
to its top-secret facility?

437
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,127
Yes, Miss Piggy.

438
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,880
Thank you.
You've been most helpful.

439
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,841
At last! A real story.

440
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,636
Intrigue, danger, new outfits.

441
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,639
And it's mine, mine, mine!
All mine!

442
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,478
Come on. Please. You think
Ted Koppel never gets excited?

443
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:43,109
So this is the car that
takes us to the limo, right?

444
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,069
Somebody should look
at those shocks.

445
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:49,407
At least they carried our stuff.
Don't hold your breath for a tip.

446
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,330
As ambassador of Earth...

447
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,958
...I welcome you.

448
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,297
I'm Edgar...

449
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,425
...but I want you to call me Ed.

450
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,051
That's Ed.

451
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:12,638
And it's an honor
to meet you, Mr. Gonzo.

452
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,515
Yeah. Me too.

453
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,183
Hors d'oeuvres!

454
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,518
Please...

455
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,521
...won't you sit?

456
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,315
Thanks.

457
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,401
Careful, careful.
You'll get gas.

458
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,864
So when do we begin, Ed?
I'm very excited about all this.

459
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,034
Me too, my friend.

460
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,954
- Me too.
- Yeah.

461
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,707
Kermie, Kermie, Kermie!

462
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,251
Kermie! Yes!

463
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,378
Kermie! Everybody!

464
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:45,755
Come here.

465
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:49,550
Listen, everyone, listen.
I've got great news.

466
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,303
Gonzo has been kidnapped
by the government...

467
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,222
...and it could be
a life-threatening situation!

468
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,058
How can that be great news?

469
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,267
Because...

470
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,855
...I've got the story!
I've got the story!

471
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:08,194
I need to change. Something that
says journalistic integrity.

472
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,739
- I've gotta pee.
- Oh, brother.

473
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,283
What are we gonna do?

474
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,243
Okay, guys, it's up to us.

475
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,622
We have to save Gonzo from
a whole army of government agents.

476
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,666
Well, I have a joke book.

477
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,501
Drumsticks! Drumsticks!

478
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,836
I have some loose Jell-O, okay.

479
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,006
Okay. Well, that settles that.

480
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,552
In circumstances like this,
there's only one place to turn.

481
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,101
- What do you got, Bunsen?
- There you are.

482
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,771
Well, Mr. Kermit, here at Muppet Labs,
we've come up with many devices...

483
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,649
...that should aid you
in your covert operations.

484
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:47,942
Excellent.

485
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,611
This seemingly ordinary
rubber ducky...

486
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,447
...actually contains
invisibility spray.

487
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,701
However, the effect is,
sadly, temporary.

488
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,621
The old rubber-ducky-with-
invisibility-spray trick. Check.

489
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,248
And, Beaker, if you would.

490
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,042
Here is something that
we're very excited about.

491
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,461
"Door in a jar"?

492
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,549
That's absolutely right, Beakie.

493
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,260
All you do is open up the jar...

494
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,595
...fling the contents
onto the wall, and poof!

495
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,098
Instant door.

496
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:23,310
What is this?
A secret communication device?

497
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,813
That's Scotch tape.
Useful if something tears.

498
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,989
And what do you have for moi?

499
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:41,829
Well, Miss Piggy, for you
we have Muppet Labs Mind Mist.

500
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,165
Simply spray it on the subject...

501
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,625
...and they will obey
your every command.

502
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,588
I dou...

503
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,385
I doubt I'll need any.

504
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,221
Okay, guys. Let's go get Gonzo.

505
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,973
Yeah. Come on.

506
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,142
- We'll find him, okay.
- Gonzo. Gonzo. Gonzo.

507
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,518
Yeah!

508
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,275
I've been looking for
something like you...

509
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,320
...all my life.

510
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,947
And now, at last, my search...

511
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,909
...has come to an end.

512
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,370
May I?

513
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,581
Before you answer,
you better be clear...

514
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,334
...on the final destination
of that finger.

515
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,551
Thanks.

516
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,478
No nostrils.

517
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,397
How do you smell?

518
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,234
Awful. Trust me, I'm his roommate.

519
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,654
That's a killer!

520
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,910
Don't...

521
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,662
...laugh...

522
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,164
...at me!

523
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:19,510
I hope I'm not imposing, but I thought
you were just great on TV.

524
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,053
Could I get your autograph?

525
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,680
- Rentro?
- Yes, sir?

526
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:23,973
It's not a good time.

527
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,767
This is probably not a good time.

528
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,896
Forgive me my earthly manners.

529
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,234
But do you have any idea
what it's like...

530
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,695
...to be laughed at?

531
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,321
Sure I do.

532
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,241
To be called names like "wacko"?

533
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,077
- And "freak boy"?
- Oh, yeah.

534
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,913
And "paranoid delusional
psychopath"?

535
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,081
Got me there.

536
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,416
To feel...

537
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:55,045
...completely alone
in this world?

538
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:59,133
I think we're starting to get
the general idea there, Ed.

539
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,855
It's wrestling legend
Hollywood Hulk Hogan?

540
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,775
Have the rat sent down
to Dr. Tucker for some tests.

541
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:20,321
Tests? But I haven't studied.
I don't even have a number-two pencil!

542
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,574
This is for
all my NWO-ites out there.

543
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,910
I will continue to dominate wrestling.

544
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,663
I'll make your back crack, your knees
freeze and your liver quiver.

545
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:34,168
I will continue to put so much pain
on you, you'll become my "painiac."

546
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,669
Hollywood.

547
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,172
Would you mind? The rat.

548
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,508
Oh, yeah.

549
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,845
- Where you going with my friend?
- What'll your fans think?

550
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:48,140
Hey, what you gonna do?
I'm a bad guy now.

551
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,810
Gonzo! Gonzo, help me! No, no!

552
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,354
Rizzo!

553
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,691
He's going to be fine.

554
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,788
Yo.

555
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,797
How you doing? I'm Bubba.

556
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,675
Hey. Rizzo. Nice to meet you.

557
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,719
Nice to meet you.
How'd you like to meet the boys?

558
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,137
Sure.

559
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,349
Up there, that's Fast Eddie,
harmonica extraordinaire.

560
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,393
- How you doing, Ed?
- Well, I ain't dead.

561
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,395
- Over here's Troy.
- Yeah, hi.

562
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,897
This back here, that's Shakes.

563
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,233
Hi. Hello. How you doing? Welcome.

564
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,403
They're doing a new
caffeine substitute on him.

565
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,988
That's the Birdman.

566
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,656
Where are you? Gladys?

567
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,992
He don't bother nobody.
Been here forever.

568
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,746
Gladys! Come on,
the guys are watching.

569
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,749
He just likes to hang out
with his birds. Know what I mean?

570
00:38:56,001 --> 00:39:00,587
So that about does it for all
of us here at Medical Research.

571
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,257
- Medical Research?
- Yeah.

572
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,509
But that would mean we're...

573
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,927
...lab rats!

574
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,097
Gonzo, get me out of here!

575
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:14,435
Now, Mr. Gonzo.

576
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,355
What can you tell me about these?

577
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,067
They really have been
looking for me.

578
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,320
- And they are coming to Earth?
- I don't know.

579
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,698
- How many are there?
- I don't know.

580
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,616
When will they be here?

581
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,245
And don't you dare tell me...

582
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,540
...that you don't know.

583
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,126
I know not?

584
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,133
But maybe I could find out?

585
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,260
Could you?

586
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,471
Okay.

587
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,139
Well!

588
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,726
Okay, then.
I'll keep in touch. Thanks.

589
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,939
So back to the limo?

590
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,027
It's a shame, really.

591
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,946
I really need that information.

592
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,451
So I'm afraid
we'll have to perform...

593
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,412
...an invasive quadra-lobal
brain probe on you...

594
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,790
...and pluck it from your head.

595
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,125
The information?

596
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,377
- No, your brain. Take him away.
- What?

597
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,631
My brain?
But just a second. I...

598
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,300
- Where are you taking me?
- Rentro, get General Luft.

599
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,844
I need my brain!
I need my brain!

600
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,684
Fozzie, tell me again.
Why are we doing this?

601
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,645
To save Gonzo.

602
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,022
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

603
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,857
Right. Because Gonzo's one of us.

604
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,402
No matter what happens, no matter
what obstacles we face...

605
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,404
...we never forget one of our own.

606
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,282
- I love it when you take charge.
- Hey!

607
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,911
We left Bunsen and Beaker
back at the gas station.

608
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,704
Okay. Well...

609
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,040
From now on,
no matter what happens...

610
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,376
...we never forget one of our own.

611
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,710
That's right.

612
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,800
Cheese Twiddle?

613
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,553
Is this movie time or something?

614
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,808
So you're the new guy.

615
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,895
From this moment on, if I say
you're hungry, you eat.

616
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,647
If I say you're sleepy...

617
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,982
I eat?

618
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,193
Oh, you shouldn't have...

619
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,697
Well, well, well.
We got a funny boy here.

620
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,407
- Is that bad?
- Very bad.

621
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:36,076
It looks like funny boy's
going to the maze.

622
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,454
Since we don't want funny boy
to get lonely...

623
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,915
...you'll all do time
in the maze.

624
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,626
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

625
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,671
See, no one's ever escaped
from the maze, funny boy.

626
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,090
Even if you did,
it's four feet to the ground...

627
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,427
...12 feet to the door
and four feet to the doorknob.

628
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,762
- That's 18 feet.
- Twenty.

629
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,558
Funny thing about doorknobs:
Rats can't turn them.

630
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,852
No opposable thumb.

631
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,583
This is ridiculous.

632
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,008
Hey, Riz, watch out
for them red circles.

633
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,968
Yeah? What's wrong with the red...?

634
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,348
Nobody ever listens.

635
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,227
Red circles. Right.

636
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:46,355
Now let me see.

637
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,484
Cheese, rat poison.
Cheese, rat poison.

638
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,696
What do you guys think, I'm crazy?
This is a no-brainer.

639
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,994
This ain't so bad.
A little breezy. Oh, boy.

640
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,461
Auntie Em, Auntie Em, it's a twister!

641
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,839
This is just like
one of those carny rides.

642
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,635
You just gotta hang on, and at the end
I get some cotton candy.

643
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,475
I'm gonna hurl!

644
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,522
You're just trying
to play mind games here.

645
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,816
But I know the cheese is safe...

646
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,778
...because you think I'm going
for the poison, right?

647
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,750
Room service.

648
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,757
Hey there, little fella.
How you doing?

649
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:00,053
While they're warming up the brain
sucker, I brought you a sandwich.

650
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,557
And I cut off the crusts there
for you. There you go.

651
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,851
Gee, that's nice. Thanks.

652
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,894
Anything for a celebrity.

653
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,981
Hey. Do you like jalapeños?

654
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,317
- Sure.
- Okay.

655
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,695
Jalapeños
Jalapeños

656
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,826
Hey, mopey!

657
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,414
- Who said that?
- I did.

658
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,333
But you're just a sandwich.

659
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,837
I'm channeling my voice through
this sandwich to deliver this message.

660
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:36,089
Great! What's the message?

661
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,384
We arrive at midnight tonight.

662
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,679
Really? And do all of you
look like sandwiches?

663
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:45,098
- Forget about the sandwich!
- I'm sorry.

664
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:49,478
Jalapeños, jalapeños
Getting my friend some jalapeños

665
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:52,689
So here's the plan:
We're landing at your house.

666
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,942
No, no, wait.
Those guys know where I live.

667
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,945
And they're not the best
examples of earthlings.

668
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,864
Gosh, where else can we land?

669
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,034
Let's see...
I know! At the beach.

670
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,620
Go to Cape Doom.
Just look for the lighthouse.

671
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:08,538
The lighthouse at Cape Doom it is.

672
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,957
Oh, boy. I didn't hear that.
I didn't hear that.

673
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,127
This is great.
But how do I get out of here?

674
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,879
Hey, I'm just a sandwich.

675
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,715
Some things you gotta
figure out for yourself.

676
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,301
By the way, you go ahead
and eat me now.

677
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,637
You're gonna need the energy.

678
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,644
- But won't that hurt?
- No, it's fine. I'm going away now.

679
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,524
- Cape Doom, right?
- Yes, Cape Doom.

680
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,401
Are you there?

681
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,738
Hello? Hello?

682
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,584
Just a little further up.

683
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:59,214
- Stop, Fozzie. Stop here. Fozzie.
- That's it.

684
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:00,674
Sorry.

685
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,085
Animal!

686
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,296
Sorry.

687
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:50,974
Stand back, boys.
This is a job for a woman.

688
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,062
Woman. Woman. Wo...

689
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,273
Hello.

690
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:02,652
What's a nice man like you doing
in a guardhouse like this?

691
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,280
I'm buffalo hunting.
What's it look like I'm doing?

692
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,866
This is a restricted area.
You gotta go.

693
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,117
Oh, no.

694
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:13,079
Look deeply into my eyes
and tell me you want me to go.

695
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,500
I want you to go.

696
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,918
Understand?

697
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,669
Now!

698
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:22,255
Okay.

699
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,885
I thought I...

700
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,141
What was I saying?

701
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,353
You were saying you were
going to open the gate.

702
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,857
Open the gate.

703
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,069
Of course, open the gate.
Come on in. Welcome!

704
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,239
- Come on, guys!
- Oh, boy.

705
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,199
Tell me I'm beautiful, sweetheart.

706
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,577
You are beautiful, sweetheart.

707
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,329
Thank you.

708
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,457
He fell on you
like a ton of bricks, okay.

709
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,627
Have a nice time.

710
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,838
- I like your tie. Very nice.
- Thank you.

711
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,799
- So long.
- Bye-bye!

712
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,634
Bye-bye.

713
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,970
What a handsome family.

714
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,225
Hey, rodents.

715
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,478
You know the cheese I promised you...

716
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,064
...after you ran that maze
and took those tests?

717
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,816
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,193
It was delicious.

719
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,620
No cheese?

720
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,081
All right! That does it!

721
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:41,001
We're busting out of this joint, boys.

722
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:45,088
Riz, even if we got over the wall,
we couldn't turn the doorknob.

723
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,466
- Yeah.
- Who needs doorknobs?

724
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,974
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

725
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,231
Very nice.

726
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,691
He likes it!

727
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,698
Guys, we gotta get through that door.

728
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,577
Should we just ask permission from
those nice men with the rifles?

729
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,287
Fozzie, those are the bad guys.

730
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,790
All right.
It's time to get invisible.

731
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,793
Fozzie, get the duck.

732
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,379
- Yes, sir.
- Duckie!

733
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,757
Here goes.

734
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,344
- I look thinner.
- Now spray yourself.

735
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,347
Okay.

736
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,184
Hey, I like this.

737
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,436
- All right, lose the duck.
- Yes, sir.

738
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,606
Listen up, guys. This stuff
doesn't last long, so let's go.

739
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,316
- Let's go.
- Yes, yes!

740
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,526
- You're squashing me.
- Sorry, Kermie.

741
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,779
Come on.
I will help you up, okay.

742
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,406
Kermit, you're so soft and plump.

743
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,368
You got one second to get
your hands off me, shrimp.

744
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,911
Sorry, Piggy.

745
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,245
Come on.

746
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,791
I have to go to the little bear's room.

747
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,584
Oh, Fozzie.

748
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,799
Smoking is very bad for you, okay.

749
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,259
Bob...

750
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,096
...didn't know you cared.

751
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:22,560
Paging Dr. Van Neuter. Please
report to Alien Surgery number five.

752
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,564
Hello.

753
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,775
I'm Dr. Van Neuter.

754
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:32,195
I'll be your brain surgeon today,
if you don't mind.

755
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,572
Get it? "Brain surgeon"? "Mind"?

756
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,035
Feeling a little nervous, are we?

757
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,662
Of course I'm nervous.

758
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,790
Everyone is before having
their brain sucked out.

759
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,126
Now, don't you go away.

760
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,469
Okay, Kermit. I'm ready.

761
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,431
Fozzie, tell me
you didn't wash your hands.

762
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,767
Of course I did.
Mom said, "Always wash your hands."

763
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,687
Not when you're wearing
invisibility spray!

764
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,565
Mom said, "No exceptions."

765
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,483
Never, ever.

766
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,986
What the...? Stop! You!

767
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:14,654
Hands up!

768
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,157
All right, remain calm.

769
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:20,910
I'm gonna have to take
you two into custody.

770
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,829
Wait. Let me explain, lady.

771
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,790
- No. Wait a minute. Where...?
- Lady, can I...? Let me explain.

772
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,625
Where are your forearms?

773
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:30,962
Woman!

774
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,590
Animal! Animal, get back here!

775
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,468
- Woman! Woman! Woman!
- Animal!

776
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,765
Give me a second to think.
He doesn't seem to be on this floor.

777
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,031
I should go change, okay.

778
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:01,493
Come on, everybody.
We need to find better cover.

779
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:08,666
Just up ahead here,
General Luft, sir.

780
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,543
There we go.

781
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:14,547
This is our new
retinal scanner, general.

782
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:31,189
- General Luft, sir.
- This had better be good.

783
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:34,818
Come on, let's go.

784
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,825
Hey, Riz. Where's Riz?
Where you going?

785
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,619
Listen. You guys go ahead.
I gotta go find my friend.

786
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:48,289
What? You could get caught.
What are you, nuts?

787
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,583
I guess I'll take my chances.

788
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,545
It was nice meeting you guys.
See you later.

789
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,755
So long, Riz.

790
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,049
Bye, Rizzo. Good luck.

791
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,176
Kid's got moxie.

792
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,806
What is moxie?

793
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,933
Let's see here.

794
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:11,062
Have you ever experienced
any achiness in your tentacles?

795
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,522
I don't have tentacles.

796
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,441
Good, no achy tentacles. Good.

797
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,777
- Head ever come off?
- No, I don't think so.

798
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,779
Good, good, good.

799
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,323
- Any gingivitis?
- No.

800
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:23,616
Great.

801
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,203
How about that beaky thing you've got
there, ever had problems with that?

802
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,038
Itching, swelling, flaking?

803
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,791
- Some flaking a couple years ago...
- Who cares?

804
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:33,960
It's showtime!

805
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,921
- Here we go.
- Oh, brother.

806
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,007
Excellent, excellent.

807
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:40,925
What's that thing?

808
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,969
I don't know. Here we go.
Here we go.

809
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:46,097
- Just stay like that.
- Okay.

810
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:51,936
This way.

811
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,022
Whose bright idea was this, anyway?

812
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,733
- Which way, Kermit?
- Kermin! Kermin!

813
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,067
This way.

814
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:00,486
I can't breathe!

815
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,738
Come on.

816
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,282
- Here we go.
- Wait, wait.

817
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,992
What is it?

818
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,161
Are you sure
this is covered by my HMO?

819
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:12,332
Good question. I'll check.

820
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,670
Gonzo.

821
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,089
Rizzo. You're alive.
Where have you been?

822
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,968
You don't want to know. Sit tight
while I chew through these straps.

823
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,303
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

824
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,348
Good news. You're covered
with a $10 co-pay.

825
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,016
Okay, hold still.

826
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:34,520
And remember, if you experience any
unpleasantness, please let me know.

827
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,813
I'd hate to miss it.

828
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,860
- Do you mind?
- Excuse me.

829
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,071
Wait!

830
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,074
Oh, good Lord! A rat!
I hate rats!

831
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,911
Then today ain't your lucky day, doc.

832
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:55,375
- Ready for an operation?
- A little experiment.

833
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,211
Forward, Piggy. Forward.

834
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,554
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

835
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,014
Doctor.

836
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:13,393
- Just a couple of doctors.
- Doctors in the hallway.

837
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,104
That was close.

838
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,524
- To the right, Fozzie.
- Forward, Piggy.

839
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,319
Too fast, too fast.
The door. Stop!

840
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,739
What in the world?

841
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:33,413
This is big, general. I think
we should notify the president.

842
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,415
I'll be the judge of that.

843
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,000
As always, sir.

844
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,293
No, don't tickle me!

845
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:43,214
- What do we do?
- Will you please get me out of here?

846
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,594
No, no, no!

847
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,929
I can't breathe!

848
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,224
Hey, guys.

849
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,852
Quick, get me out of here!

850
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,395
Today, sir...

851
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,189
...we must think with a big mind.

852
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,316
Behold.

853
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:07,447
Irrefutable evidence
of extraterrestrial life.

854
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,623
Release me...

855
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:27,300
This looks worse than it is, general.

856
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,093
Obviously, the...

857
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:31,554
Get off of me, you vermin!

858
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,097
The alien is loose in the building.

859
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,933
But not to worry, because...

860
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,477
Don't bother.

861
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,479
You're terminated.

862
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:44,067
- When you say "terminated"...
- You need help, Singer!

863
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,860
Find some!

864
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,328
Well, how'd that
go for you, then? Okay?

865
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,833
So sorry I got you into this mess.
Thanks for coming to save me.

866
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,877
You can thank us once
we're out of here.

867
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,046
All right, quietly now.

868
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,133
Stop! Come back here!

869
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,011
Help! Mommy!

870
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,138
Please, please.
Listen to me.

871
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,099
You can't leave me.

872
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,101
I need you.

873
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,151
I go now.

874
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,445
Fine. Go on, go.

875
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:30,988
You're all alike.

876
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,033
Animals.

877
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,497
Call me.

878
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,668
Animal. Animal!

879
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:45,044
Come here.

880
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:48,047
Way to go, Romeo.
Now let's get out of here.

881
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,298
Let's go, let's go.

882
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,217
I'm gonna kill somebody.

883
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,720
Now, now.
Remember, calm blue ocean.

884
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,057
You let it go.
Baby steps, remember? Baby...

885
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,143
Find the alien!

886
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,686
Now!

887
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:03,396
Yes, sir.

888
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,450
- Try that door.
- It won't budge!

889
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,538
Forget that door. Come on!

890
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,541
This way!

891
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,086
Fozzie, quick!
The door in a jar.

892
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,338
- It's right here.
- Yeah, yeah.

893
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,174
"Open jar away from face."

894
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,426
Will you please just open the jar?

895
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,595
Hurry, Fozzie.
Come on, throw it!

896
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,312
That's disappointing.

897
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,981
Perfect. Somebody knock
and see if Barbie's home.

898
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,609
Works for me.

899
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:52,904
What?

900
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:57,200
I cannot believe that
little shrimp left us behind.

901
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,077
I am not a shrimp.
I am a king prawn.

902
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,871
Let's go, let's go! Come on!

903
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,375
Hurry, hurry!

904
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:14,300
Keep going, everybody.
Don't look back. Run!

905
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,678
- Did you have a good time?
- Thank you.

906
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,306
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, nice man.

907
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,311
What the heck is going on?

908
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:27,521
- We did it!
- See that?

909
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,733
When we pull together,
we can do anything.

910
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,654
Now we can go meet my alien
brothers at Cape Doom.

911
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:40,117
What makes you think
that aliens are landing there?

912
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,245
Oh, a sandwich told me.

913
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,663
Oh, no.

914
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,165
I'd give it a rest there, buddy.

915
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,043
Do you mean that you guys
still don't believe me?

916
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,294
Well...

917
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:54,674
All right, fine. Stop the bus.
I'll get there by myself.

918
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,260
No, no. Wait, Gonzo.
Wait. Look.

919
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,179
It doesn't matter what we believe.

920
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:05,184
If you believe that you need
to go and meet your alien brothers...

921
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,811
...then I say...

922
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,147
Well, I say we're going to the beach.
Right, guys?

923
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:11,857
The beach, okay.

924
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,192
To the beach.

925
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,402
Great!

926
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,612
Beach ball! Beach ball!

927
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,615
Get the crew to Cape Doom
on the double.

928
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,910
And look, this is my exclusive,
so don't tell anyone.

929
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,161
I got it.

930
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:28,374
Pack it up, guys! The spaceship
is landing at Cape Doom!

931
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,387
Where is he?

932
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,391
Well, I didn't overhear anything...

933
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,480
Did I ask you
if you overheard anything?

934
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:52,898
No, sir.

935
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,401
Because if you did
overhear anything...

936
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,903
...I'm sure you would tell me.

937
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,572
Yes, sir.

938
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,575
Or do I have to remind you...

939
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:06,412
...of Mr. Jumbo's Circus Town
and Wild Animal Revue?

940
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,498
Where's he going?

941
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,961
Oh, look.

942
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,756
Sunday's half price
at the petting zoo.

943
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,925
Okay, okay!
They're going to Cape Doom.

944
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,345
Good, good.

945
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:25,765
Get me the subatomic
neutro-destabiliser.

946
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,729
The subatomic neutro...
The really big gun.

947
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,315
The really big gun. Yes, sir.

948
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,108
The really big gun.

949
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,907
Really big gun.

950
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,200
Clip.

951
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:45,743
Clip!

952
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,291
Let's head for my car.

953
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,918
Problem there, sir.

954
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:58,589
Remember those parking tickets
you asked me to take care of for you?

955
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,132
And I said that...

956
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,469
Oh, just say it.

957
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:05,346
Car's impounded.

958
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,309
We can take my company car.

959
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,311
- Fine.
- Great.

960
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:16,148
Sixty-six bottles of beer on the wall
Sixty-six bottles of beer

961
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,400
Excuse me.

962
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:21,487
Excuse me!
Can this thing go any faster?

963
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:23,155
I'm doing 30.

964
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:25,825
You want to slow down there, buddy?

965
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:29,912
A lot of traffic tonight, sir.
Safety first.

966
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,302
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

967
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,770
What's with all these crazy people?

968
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,899
Can I help it if moi
has such devoted fans?

969
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,069
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

970
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,196
All right, everybody, back off!

971
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,532
Make way!
Let His Royal Weirdness through.

972
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,117
Everybody be cool.

973
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:10,035
Stay back. Be cool, okay.

974
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,500
Get your Gonzo T-shirts right here.
Ten bucks!

975
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,797
Goodbye, Rainbow,
and stay groovy.

976
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,570
Got cold.

977
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,198
Yeah. Sure did.

978
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:52,119
Midnight. The Ione alien
stands before a naked sky.

979
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,079
The mood is tense.

980
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,499
- My hair looks great.
- What?

981
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,710
I don't believe this.

982
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:01,003
Shelley.

983
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,964
You backstabbing, underhanded
little coffee pig.

984
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:06,008
- What?
- This is my show!

985
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:08,302
My story, my microphone.

986
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:12,431
Shelley Snipes reporting.
Please ignore the little sow.

987
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,099
Disregard this woman. I...

988
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,543
What am I doing?

989
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:45,965
You are about to give me your job
and get everyone here coffee.

990
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,800
Oh, yes. Of course.

991
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,635
Right away.

992
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,140
I love this stuff.

993
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:56,809
How you doing?

994
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,477
Excuse me, buddy.

995
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,105
And a happy Halloween to you
as well.

996
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,151
It's all right. Take it easy.

997
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,653
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, it's all right?

998
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:11,490
You don't understand. We let
him slide, and he gave us a ride.

999
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,451
Yeah, yeah.
I love all my new rat friends now.

1000
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,745
Come on.
Who wants this next marshmallow?

1001
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,581
- Can you believe that?
- Look at that.

1002
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,666
Hey, fellas.
Look who's here over here.

1003
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:21,917
- Rizzo!
- Hey, buddy!

1004
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:26,171
It's too bad Dawson isn't here for this.

1005
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:29,717
Tell me about it. This whole situation
is like one of his sci-fi movies.

1006
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:33,220
But this is a Muppet movie.
It's much more realistic...

1007
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,682
...and romantic, okay.

1008
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,142
Right.

1009
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,769
What's your deal?
Are you an alien or something?

1010
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,480
No, baby.
Me and Gonzo are very tight.

1011
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,858
We'll be chilling
in our hot tub later on.

1012
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,777
Perhaps you'd like
to partake in the party.

1013
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,864
Geeks.

1014
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,451
All right. Don't answer right away.
We'll be here.

1015
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,369
Oh, she'll be back.

1016
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,128
One a.m.

1017
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,882
The alien is still
standing over there.

1018
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,134
My hair still looks great.

1019
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:14,053
One can only wonder...

1020
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:18,015
...what Gonzo's feeling right now.

1021
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,811
They're not coming.

1022
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:26,315
Maybe they're just running late.

1023
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,817
It's a no-show. It's a no-show.

1024
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,194
What?

1025
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,572
Hey, wait a second.
I believed you, man.

1026
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:37,868
Yeah. I stayed up all night dancing...

1027
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:40,746
...and didn't study for finals
because of you.

1028
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,874
I'm cold. Come on, let's go.

1029
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,381
I'm out of here.

1030
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,938
Look!

1031
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:03,996
Boy.

1032
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,415
They're really tiny.

1033
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:11,253
But tiny's not a bad thing, right?

1034
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,131
No. Tiny's good.

1035
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:19,136
Wait a minute. We came out here in the
middle of the night for a stupid egg?

1036
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,847
It could be full of chocolate, okay.

1037
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:15,400
Shoot it! Shoot it!

1038
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:32,084
Please, big boss.
I never disobeyed my mother.

1039
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:35,796
And I never carried the plague.
Not even once!

1040
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,833
- Are you okay, Gonzo?
- Great. Never felt better.

1041
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:30,976
Let the one who is called Gonzo
step forward.

1042
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,103
That's me!

1043
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:36,189
I'm Gonzo.

1044
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:39,026
Step a little closer.

1045
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:45,198
Come a little further forward.

1046
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,827
Lean into the light.

1047
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,581
There you go.
Lean in a little further.

1048
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,625
A little further.

1049
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,337
That's him!

1050
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,429
Gonzo.

1051
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,848
Many zotons ago...

1052
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:12,225
...you were lost to us.

1053
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:16,772
We've come a long way looking
for you, little brother.

1054
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,653
We know of but one way...

1055
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:26,198
...to express our happiness
at having found you.

1056
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:40,712
Now there's a party going on
Right here

1057
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,006
- Right here
- A celebration

1058
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:45,384
That's my family! That's my family!

1059
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:49,680
So bring your good times
And your laughter too

1060
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:53,141
We're gonna celebrate
Your party with you

1061
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,937
- Come on, now
- Celebration

1062
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:01,525
Let's all celebrate
And have a good time

1063
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:05,487
Celebration

1064
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,991
We're gonna celebrate
And have a good time

1065
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:13,161
It's time to come together

1066
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:17,040
It's up to you
What's your pleasure?

1067
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:21,253
Everyone around the world
Come on

1068
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,297
Celebrate good times

1069
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:25,757
Come on

1070
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:36,768
It's a celebration

1071
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:39,521
Yeah.

1072
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:44,401
Celebrate good times
Come on

1073
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:47,279
Gonzo, I want
to see you up here on the stage!

1074
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,614
- Me?
- Yeah, you, boy!

1075
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:57,122
Look at him go, guys.
Look at him up there!

1076
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:02,627
Celebrate good times
Come on

1077
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,926
It's the Great Gonzo!

1078
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,805
This way.

1079
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:22,189
Gonzo, it is time to take your righteous
place amongst your brothers.

1080
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,565
Thanks...

1081
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:25,067
Here you go.

1082
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:29,362
By surviving and thriving alone
on this alien planet...

1083
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,157
...you have proven
yourself audacious...

1084
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,910
...courageous and
distinctly one of a kind.

1085
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:38,163
We welcome you back
with our most...

1086
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,165
...ceremonious of ceremonies.

1087
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:41,541
What's that?

1088
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,127
We gonna blow you up, baby.

1089
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,930
Yes, yes, yes!

1090
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:04,106
I love these people!

1091
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,857
Coming down!

1092
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,488
Cowabunga!

1093
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,453
Oh, no!

1094
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,542
Where's he gone?

1095
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,717
He's okay! He's all right.

1096
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:37,180
Now, that is what I call
the Great Gonzo.

1097
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,725
It's so good to see you.

1098
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,276
Yes! Yes!

1099
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,406
Hold it!

1100
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:57,242
Hold it.

1101
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,579
Get out of the way, you freak.

1102
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:05,584
Very, very moving,
my little alien friend.

1103
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,753
But I'm afraid your timing is off.

1104
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,213
Now...

1105
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,799
...you're coming back with me...

1106
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,386
...in my cement truck.

1107
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,725
What's so funny?

1108
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,688
Don't laugh at me.

1109
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:29,107
Don't laugh...
All right.

1110
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:32,027
I'll show you laughter!

1111
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:33,236
No!

1112
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,781
Please load weapon.

1113
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:41,203
Please load weapon.
Please load weapon.

1114
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:47,751
Come on. Come on.

1115
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:58,470
My toe!

1116
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:02,307
This certainly is good!

1117
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,310
That was a close one.

1118
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:08,521
Not as close as you think, my friend.

1119
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,982
"Please load weapon."

1120
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:22,369
- We are honored to meet you.
- A most extraordinary performance.

1121
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:24,162
What are you talking about?

1122
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:29,000
Gonzo of Earth, who is this most
entertaining friend of yours?

1123
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,460
That's Ed.

1124
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,003
- Hi, Ed.
- Hello, Ed.

1125
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,339
- The cape.
- The cape!

1126
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,508
The cape for Ed.

1127
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:40,011
Ed, because of
your comic instincts...

1128
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:44,182
...we have chosen you
as ambassador to our planet.

1129
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,521
You mean
you want me to go with you?

1130
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:57,070
To boldly go where
no man has gone before?

1131
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:00,740
It would be our great privilege, Ed.

1132
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,202
May I call you Zongo?

1133
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,037
- Zongo.
- Zongo.

1134
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:12,168
To travel the stars
like a modern-day Magellan?

1135
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,880
To be up there with John Glenn...

1136
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,549
...Neil Armstrong.

1137
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:21,136
I think you better get going.
They're waiting for you.

1138
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,512
Run along now.

1139
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,764
This way, Zongo.

1140
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,063
Baby steps, sir.

1141
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,399
Baby steps.

1142
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,401
Time to beat feet.

1143
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:39,112
Come along, little brother.

1144
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:41,906
Oh, boy.

1145
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:44,909
This is happening so fast.

1146
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,080
Well, guys, you know...

1147
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:52,667
...I'm gonna miss you.
And I'll be thinking about you.

1148
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:54,085
Rizzo, buddy...

1149
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:57,630
No, no, not me.
I do not do goodbyes.

1150
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,674
Well, I just want to tell you...

1151
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,303
I just want you
to take care of yourself.

1152
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:05,722
Don't worry about me. I...

1153
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,391
I can always get another roommate.

1154
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,268
Oh, buddy.

1155
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,315
- Take care.
- You too.

1156
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,068
And, Kermit...

1157
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,529
...you're the best friend
any alien could ask for.

1158
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,492
We love you, Gonzo.

1159
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,293
So you'll write?

1160
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,379
Yeah, sure, I'll write.

1161
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,465
There's probably a mailbox
every couple of light-years.

1162
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,927
- Yeah.
- Adiós, Mr. Spaceman, okay.

1163
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:48,473
Man, you keep saying goodbye,
and you'll never get home.

1164
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:52,060
Oh, yeah. Home. Home.

1165
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:56,940
Time to go home.

1166
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:16,835
The stars beckon.

1167
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,464
Shall we go home?

1168
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,182
I don't think so.

1169
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,272
Gonzo?

1170
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,817
Thank you for going
to so much trouble to find me.

1171
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,654
But I can't go.

1172
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,660
I love these guys.

1173
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,372
My life is here.

1174
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,084
This is my home.

1175
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,214
If that is your decision...

1176
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:06,134
...then we shall abide by it.

1177
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:08,219
We will miss you.

1178
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:12,223
So good luck, Gonzo.

1179
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:15,727
Yes.

1180
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:19,022
People of Earth, later.

1181
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,482
Yes!

1182
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:23,610
Oh, boy.

1183
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,445
Goodbye!

1184
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:28,156
You're back! You're back!

1185
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:31,117
People of Earth...

1186
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:37,499
...this is one small step for man...

1187
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:43,505
...and one giant step for...

1188
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,757
Forget it.

1189
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:31,427
What a great day.

1190
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:35,139
That was probably the best day
of my whole life.

1191
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,977
There's one thing
I still don't understand.

1192
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:40,478
What's that, Gonzo?

1193
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:43,356
Why did they ask me
to build a Jacuzzi?
