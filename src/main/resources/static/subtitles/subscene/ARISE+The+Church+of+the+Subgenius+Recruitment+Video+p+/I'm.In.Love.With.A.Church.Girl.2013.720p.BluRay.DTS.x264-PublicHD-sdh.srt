about going to church?

1237
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,532
God don't want somebody
like me in his church, okay?

1238
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,163
Ridiculous.

1239
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,757
What are you smiling about?

1240
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,718
Look, babe, I'm not trying
to belittle your feelings.

1241
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,470
Look, I'm sorry,

1242
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,639
but you're just so off.

1243
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,767
Like, so off.

1244
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:51,187
And to be honest,
I'm a little relieved

1245
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:52,605
'cause I thought
you were actually

1246
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:53,814
keeping something from me...

It doesn't matter.

1251
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,577
God doesn't care about
what you've done in your past

1252
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,246
or what you're in the middle of
right now.

1253
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,624
He just wants you
to come as you are.

You sure about that?

1255
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,169
I'm positive.

1256
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:16,963

1257
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,174
"What causes a man
to gain the whole world

1258
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:23,594
and lose his soul."

1259
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,765

to lose your soul.

better than the cars,
better than the money.

I mean, you don't really look

1379
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:04,708
I don't, huh?

1380
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,126

1381
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,795
supposed to look like,
Miles?

1382

I mean, look at you, man.

your jewelry...

1384
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:15,886

yourself there, Miles.

1387
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,434
I recall pulling into
the parking lot

1388
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,228
and passing
a four-door black Bentley

1389
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,688
that I've never seen here
before,

1390
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,731
and I'm assuming that's yours,
man.

1391
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,733
Yeah, but I ain't no pastor.

1392
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,944
True that, but the last time
I read the Bible,

1393
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:35,739
it said nothing
about style being a sin.

1394
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,533
Kind of goes back
to that old saying

1395
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,035
that you cannot judge a book
by its cover, you heard?

1396
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,121
Yeah, I dig.

1397
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,040
So what made you
want to be a pastor anyway?

1398
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,459
Well, God had a calling
on my life, Miles,

1399
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,878
and as much as I tried
to avoid that call,

1400
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,463
I couldn't avoid it anymore,

1401
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,923
and here I am.

1402
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:54,717
He's got a calling
on your life, too.

1403
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:55,968
On everybody's life.

1404
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,177
But you got to answer
the phone

1405
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,971
when He calls, you dig?

1406
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,306
A calling, huh?

1407
