1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:02,835
My lover’s got humour

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,172
She’s the giggle at a funeral

3
00:00:06,787 --> 00:00:08,288
Knows everybody’s disapproval

4
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:11,291
I should’ve worshiped her sooner

5
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:14,170
If the Heavens ever did speak

6
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:17,548
She is the last true mouthpiece

7
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:20,299
Every Sunday’s getting more bleak

8
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:22,303
A fresh poison each week

9
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,932
‘We were born sick,’ you heard them say it

10
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:29,018
My church offers no absolutes

11
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:32,064
She tells me ‘worship in the bedroom’

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,442
The only heaven I’ll be sent to

13
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,279
Is when I’m alone with you

14
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:40,949
I was born sick, but I love it

15
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,826
Command me to be well

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,829
Amen. Amen. Amen

17
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,582
Take me to church

18
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,793
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

19
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:05,962
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

20
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:08,964
Offer me that deathless death

21
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:10,551
Good God, let me give you my life

22
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:12,430
Take me to church

23
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,603
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

24
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:19,856
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

25
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:22,608
Offer me that deathless death

26
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,235
Good God, let me give you my life

27
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,487
If I’m a pagan of the good times

28
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:32,991
My lover’s the sunlight

29
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:35,202
To keep the Goddess on my side

30
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:38,120
She demands a sacrifice

31
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:40,873
To drain the whole sea

32
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:42,250
Get something shiny

33
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:45,377
Something meaty for the main course

34
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:48,131
That’s a fine looking high horse

35
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:51,966
What you got in the stable?

36
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,260
We’ve a lot of starving faithful

37
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,387
That looks tasty

38
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:56,389
That looks plenty

39
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:59,475
This is hungry work

40
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:01,143
Take me to church

41
00:02:02,228 --> 00:02:04,145
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

42
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,396
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

43
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,775
Offer me that deathless death

44
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:13,610
Good God, let me give you my life

45
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:15,862
Take me to church

46
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:19,531
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

47
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:23,617
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

48
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,371
Offer me that deathless death

49
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,123
Good God, let me give you my life

50
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:36,669
No masters or kings when the ritual begins

51
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:43,504
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

52
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:51,923
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene

53
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:55,176
Only then I am human

54
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:59,430
Only then I am clean

55
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:15,933
Amen. Amen. Amen

56
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,686
Take me to church

57
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:21,314
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,566
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

59
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,279
Offer me that deathless death

60
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,073
Good God, let me give you my life

61
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:33,451
Take me to church

62
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:36,163
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

63
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:40,334
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

64
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:43,921
Offer me that deathless death

65
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,343
Good God, let me give you my life

66
00:03:50,345 --> 00:04:00,180
