First up, we got Percy Taylor,

aka P-body.

214
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,268
He's the muscle of this crew

He is best friends with
the leader of this crew.

You can be sure wherever
you see the leader,

So how do you know
the Halston family?

375
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,194
You know, Nick's my
broker and my money guy,

376
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,821
so we hang out
from time to time.

377
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,407
So young and into stocks.

378

Okay.

381
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,539
So you go to church
on Sundays, then?

382
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,500
Yes, Sir. Every Sunday.

383
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,794
So, uh, what was
your religion again?

384
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,253
I guess I'm "Christian,"
but, you know,

385
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,672
we don't really like
to call it that.

386
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,299
Right, right. You like
to say "men of faith."

387
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,717
Or in your case, it would
be "woman of faith."

388
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,927
Exactly, so you know exactly

389
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,261
what I'm talking about, right?

390
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,846

392
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,602
Oh, well, right now, I'm
kind of in between churches.

393
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,355

394
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,523
Yeah.

what was the name

of the last church
you attended?

398
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,238
I really don't remember,

399
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,241
but I'm sure I could call
my mom and she, you know...

400
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,702
You are so playing with
me right now, Mr. Miles.

401

All right, you caught me.

402
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,789
But I do go to church on
Easter Sundays with my mom,

403
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,417
and on Christmas, I mean, if
that counts for anything.

404
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,044
Look, I grew up in
a Catholic church,

405
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,462
but, you know, I don't know...

406
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,673
I never really stuck with it.

407
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,968
I think I just didn't feel
comfortable in my church.

408
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,512
Well, you should find a church
you do feel comfortable at

409
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,056

so I could see you again?

00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,922
I got to take this one.

523
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,133
I'm sorry.

524
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,677
Yo.

525
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,471
Hey, what's buzzin', cousin?

526
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,765
T, what's going on, man?
What's happening?

527
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,641
I'm just trying to make a
dollar out of 15 cents.

528
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,060
You know.

529
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,603
So, hey, did you fire
off that package?

530
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,271
Oh, yeah, man, that
should be on your desk

531
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,273
by tomorrow morning,
probably around 10:00.

532
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,108
Man, I like your style, Miles.

533
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,277
So you all locked and
loaded on your end, right?

534
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,945
Oh, yeah, for sure, man.

535
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,989
Everything's set up just the
way we planned it, man.

536
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,616
I got y'all hooked up, man,

537
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,076
so I'll see y'all in
a couple of weeks.

538
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,660
One love, baby.

539
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,497
What do you make
of this, Brian?

540
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,291
You ever hear of
this guy T before?

541
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,794
Can't say that I have.

542
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,380
Where'd the call come from?

543
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,924
Cell phone outside of Ohio.

544
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,133
Could be one of his clients,

545
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,928
maybe even a connection.

546
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,555
That would be my guess.

547
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,476
This is good, right?

548
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,560
Yeah.

549
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,771
Real good.

550
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,816
Do you have to go?

551
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,275
'Cause I would
totally understand.

552
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,944
Oh, no, no, no. Know what?

553
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,488
Matter of fact, let me turn
this phone off right now

554
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,323
so we can enjoy our dinner.

555
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,367
Don't you dare, Miles. No,
no, it's okay, really.

556
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,785
Yo, it's clearly business.

557
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,621
Like, I would never
ask you to do that.

558
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,958
You know what? That's dope.

559
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,709
I mean, you know,
a lot of women,

560
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,462
they'd be like, you know,
"You're being rude,"

561
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:46,091
or, you know, "Could
you turn that off?"

562
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,428
Anyways, so did
the stock market

563
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,804
get you all of this...

564
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,431
the house, the cars,
the jewelry...

565
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:56,017
or did you, like, run into
some amazing family fortune?

566
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,477
Actually, I like
to keep my hands

567
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,979
in a lot of different things.

568
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,981
You know, right now, I
got a string of shows

569
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,524
that I'm doing right
here in the Bay.

570
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,109
Matter of fact, I'm
doing three shows.

571
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,945
I got one in Frisco,
one in Oakland,

572
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,780
and I'm doing one right
here in San Jose.

573
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,367
Wow, Miles, that's...
that's exciting.

574
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,413
You know, I was
thinking, um...

575
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,206
I don't know... maybe
you might want

576
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,834
to come hang out with me
for a couple of the shows.

577
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,044
You ain't got to go to all
of them, but you know...

578
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:27,883
Mr. Miles, are you asking
me on another date?

579
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:32,095
Why, I think I am,
Miss Vanessa.

580
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,972
I'd love that.

581
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,224
Well, then it's a date.

582
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,941
Look, Miles, I really had
a good time tonight.

583
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,318
You know, I really did, too.

584
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,694
I'm not just saying that!

585
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,489
Me neither. I had
a great time.

586
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,324
Yo, I still cannot believe

587
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,327
you spent all this money
on this big house

588
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,745
to live in it by yourself.

589
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,205
Really? I don't know.

590
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,290
Well, maybe one day,
I'll find somebody

591
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,293
to, you know, fill it.

592
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,920
I mean, does it really
make a difference

593
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,713
if I get the house first

594
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,715
and then find somebody
special to share it with?

595
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,510
I guess not. No.

596
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,888
Silver convertible, huh?

597
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,599
Yep. And?

598
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,643
You want to hear
a funny story?

599
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:20,811
Sure.

600
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,272
A few weeks ago, I'm driving,

601
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,275
and I come to this stop sign,

602
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,277
and I look over at
the intersection,

603
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,489
and I see this convertible,

604
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,242
but what really caught
my eye was this...

605
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:38,370
this beautiful woman
that was driving.

606
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:42,791
I mean, she had, like,
long, beautiful black hair

607
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,168
kind of like yours.

608
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,545
And she was wearing
these shades...

609
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,129
these really hot shades.

610
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,550
I mean, I was on her.

611
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,177
I felt like I had
to catch her.

612
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,889
So I... you know,
I get in pursuit.

613
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,683
I'm holding up traffic.

614
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:03,103
I'm bobbing and weaving
in between cars.

615
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,106
Anyway, to make a
long story short,

616
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,858
I get pulled over
by the police,

617
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,612
but you know what really,
really bothered me?

618
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,074
What?

619
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,536
Was that I didn't get
a chance to meet her.

620
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,540
I didn't get a chance
to know who she was.

621
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,421
What kind of car did
you say this was?

622
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,425
Um, hmm.

623
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,722
A silver convertible Sebring.

Yes, he's in the...

631
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,542
Don't say his name so loud.

Well, don't just stand there.

00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,341
Go over there and talk to him.

637

didn't come here

Thank you.

pretty big market

650
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,161
for this church stuff, huh?

651
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,579
That's right.

Aw, they look really
cute together.

She looks really happy.
Yeah, I know.

was such a jerk.

We have, like, a
bunch of T-shirts

656
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,508
and, you know, books, and CDs
that are Christ-like themed.

657
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,301
Stuff like that.

658
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,844
And these are all
Christian artists?

Come on, Miles. He
is a real rapper.

662
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,769
He just, you know,
raps about the Lord.

663

Nah, nah, nah. That's
not what I'm saying.

looks like a gangster,

872

873
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:09,232
I feel like you might not
want to see me no more,

874
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,109

scares me, babe.

875
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,694

876
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,831
Look, I know this great
little restaurant.

877
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,165
Great coffee.

878
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,793
Best pie in town.

879
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,003

Please go to sleep.

884

our daughter's out

He's a boy, Lydia.

889

Well, I got a really bad vibe

890
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,532
from that so-called
boy, Miguel.

891
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,367
He doesn't seem her type.

892
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,579

never have a type.

What'd you think about
my friends tonight?

900
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,563
They looked like gangsters
and drug dealers.

901
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,774
That's because they are, V.

902
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,986
I mean, they're not,
like, Mafia or anything,

903
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,197
but they live that lifestyle,

904
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,616
and to be honest, I used
to live just like them.

905
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,576
In fact,

906
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,454
they all used to work for me.

907
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,833
Work for you?

908
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,252
Doing what?

909
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,420
Here we go.

910
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,631
Thank you.

911

Folks, let me know if there's
anything else you need.

912
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,053
Yep. Thank you.

913
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,305
Work for you doing what?

914
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,933
I used to be a drug
dealer, Vanessa,

915
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,393
and those guys
you met tonight,

916
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,021
that was my crew.

917
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,775
I mean, basically, we was
into any and everything.

918
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,656
Wow, Miles, I don't...

919
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,450
I don't even know what to say.

920
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,747
Look.

921
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,501
I don't talk about it
'cause I'm not proud of it.

922
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,002
I mean, I don't
know how I did it.

923
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:38,089
I don't even know why I did it.
I just did.

924
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,341
But I can honestly say

925
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,177
I'm a better man
from all of that.

926
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,266
Wow, Miles.

927
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:51,185
Well, about your
friends, baby,

928
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,356
the Bible says that bad company
corrupts good character.

929
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,149
You really think
this is a wise idea,

930
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,651
still hanging out
with these guys

931
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,486
when they do what they do?

932
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,697
Those are my friends, V.

933
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,573
I mean, those dudes...

934
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,284
they're like my family,

935
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,244
and I can count on
them for anything.

936
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,912
Look, I've been trying
to tell these guys

937
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,915
there's other ways
to make legal money.

938
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,750
I mean, I spent the last
two years of my life

939
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,337
just trying to wash and
shake all that off.

940
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,172
Shake it off, huh?

941
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,383
Look, I'm not this
perfect guy, V,

942
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,845
but I'm trying.

943
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,686
Miles, that was a mouthful.

944
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,104
To be honest with you, babe,

945
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,524
it almost sounds
like a testimony

946
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,445
of someone who's had their
life turned around by God.

947
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,699
Thank you

948
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,201
for even wanting to
share that with me.

949
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,829
Am I okay with it?

950
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,125
I don't know about all that.

951
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,421
Does it make me want
to pull away from you?

952
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,342
No.

953
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,469
If anything, it...

954
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,388
makes me want to
get closer to you.

"equally yoked" means?

What do you mean, like
eggs or something?

965
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,477
No, silly.

966
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,772
In the Bible, God refers to
our spirits as equally yoked,

967
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:04,193
so in order for you and
I to be equally yoked,

968
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,237
it means that we have
to feel the same way

969
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,906
about each other and God

970
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,618
and put Jesus in the center
of this relationship.

971
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,870

you can do that?

a little break

1049

something to eat.

from early in their lives.

1223
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,637
We all have a lot of
stuff we have to do.

1224
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,472
You're always gonna have a lot
of things you have to do.

1225
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:05,807
Look, I'm gonna put
aside the fact that

1226
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,225
my entire family
is expecting you

1227
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,643
and that, hey, I'd
actually like you

1228
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,020
to come to church with me,

1229
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:11,396
and what I'm really
concerned with

1230
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,480
is what the real issue is.

1231
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,523
Why don't you just tell me?

1232
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,816
There's nothing to tell.

1233
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,193
Really? There's
nothing to tell?

1234
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:17,527
Look, I'm not even buying that.

1235
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,321
What is so bad about
going to church?

1236
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,532
God don't want somebody like
me in his church, okay?

1237
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,163
Ridiculous.

1238
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,797
What are you smiling about?

1239
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,759
Look, babe, I'm not trying
to belittle your feelings.

1240
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,510
Look, I'm sorry,

1241
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,679
but you're just so off.

1242
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,807
Like, so off.

1243
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:51,228
And to be honest, I'm
a little relieved

1244
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:52,646
'cause I thought
you were actually

1245
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:53,855
keeping something from me...

1246
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,899
something ugly.

1247
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,319
Well, don't be getting
all happy just yet.

1248
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,821
I haven't told you
why I feel this way.

1249
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,823
It doesn't matter.

1250
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,618
God doesn't care about what
you've done in your past

1251
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,286
or what you're in the
middle of right now.

1252
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,665
He just wants you
to come as you are.

1253
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,250
You sure about that?

1254
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,210
I'm positive.

1255
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,003
Look, the Bible says,

1256
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,215
"What causes a man to
gain the whole world

1257
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:23,635
and lose his soul."

1258
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,806
Baby, I don't want you
to lose your soul.

1259
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:32,018
Once you really get to
know God and His Word,

1260
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:35,063
you'll see that that book
is better than life,

1261
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:38,858
better than the cars,
better than the money.

1262
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,236
For a man like you,
even better than...

1263
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:42,570
Better than what?

1264
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,863

00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,748

look like a pastor.

1380
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,835
supposed to look like, Miles?

1381
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:10,797
I don't know, man. I
mean, look at you, man.

1382

yourself there, Miles.

Yeah, but I don't drive
no Lambo, Pastor.

The Lambo, huh?

1386
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,475
I recall pulling
into the parking lot

1387
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,269
and passing a four-door
black Bentley

1388
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,728
that I've never
seen here before,

1389
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,772
and I'm assuming
that's yours, man.

1390
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,774
Yeah, but I ain't no pastor.

1391
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,985
True that, but the last
time I read the Bible,

1392
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:35,780
it said nothing about
style being a sin.

1393
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,574
Kind of goes back
to that old saying

1394
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,076
that you cannot judge a book
by its cover, you heard?

1395
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,161
Yeah, I dig.

1396
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,081
So what made you want
to be a pastor anyway?

1397
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,500
Well, God had a calling
on my life, Miles,

1398
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,919
and as much as I tried
to avoid that call,

1399
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,504
I couldn't avoid it anymore,

1400
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,964
and here I am.

1401
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:54,757
He's got a calling
on your life, too.

1402
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,009
On everybody's life.

1403
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,218
But you got to
answer the phone

1404
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,012
when He calls, you dig?

1405
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,346
A calling, huh?

1406
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,140
A calling. I tell you what.

1407
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,766
We'll talk more about
that in the future.

1408

I'd love to see you around
here a little bit more.

1409

Sunday, Vanessa.

1411

today, by the way.

1414

Pleasure's all mine.

1415
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,445
Hope you two brought
your appetites,

1416

enough for an army.

1417

1418
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,410
So you got Miles
to go to church?

1419
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,370
Mm-hmm. Just this Sunday.

1420
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,331

01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,480

gonna lie to you.

What?

1464
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,365
I'm still trying to figure
this whole thing out.

1465
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,075
I mean, I know there's a God,

1466
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,578
and I'm supposed to act a
certain way and everything,

1467
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:31,414
but to be real, babe,

1468
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:34,250
I'm still researching this
whole salvation thing.

1469
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,918
I mean, I just don't
want to dive into it.

1470
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,295
Does that make any
sense to you?

1471
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:39,297
Yes, it makes perfect
sense, babe.

1472
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:40,506
I get it.

1473
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,716
I will say this, though.

1474
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:43,176
What will you say?

1475
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:44,594

when I'm in church.

1476
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,137
Yeah? Yeah.

1477
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:48,139
I mean, it feels like
everything's moving

in the right
direction, you know?

1479
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,310
But then I get to thinking,

1480
01:02:52,311 --> 01:02:55,772
if God is this all loving,

1481
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,983
all seeing, all being God,

1482
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,777
then why does He allow
things to happen

1483
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:03,404
like rape, murder,

1484
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,864

understand, babe.

01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,246
I see you clearly have been
giving this a lot of thought.

1487
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,791
Well, yeah, I mean,
just the other night,

1488
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,085
I'm sitting in bed, and I'm
watching this program,

1489
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:20,296
and this Muslim
speaker's speaking,

1490
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,924
and he's talking about
the book that they read,

1491
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,175
the Koran.

1492
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:25,635
Okay.

1493
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,053
He's basically saying that,

1494
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:28,846
you know, they believe
that Jesus existed

1495
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,641
but that he was
only a prophet,

1496
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:34,268
and then he started getting
into all these scientific facts

1497
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,146
that exist in the Koran

1498
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,691
that, you know, scientists
didn't even discover.

1499
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,109
I thought it was...

1500
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,403
I thought it was really,
really interesting.

1501
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,615
All right, well, how
did it make you feel?

1502
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,661
To be honest?

1503
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:52,913
I don't know,

1504
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,667
it's a lot to swallow, babe.

1505
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,379
All right, well,

1506

01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,251
All at the same time.

1738
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,465
Then I get confused

1739
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:32,759
about what I think
God is telling me.

1740
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,221
I never feel like I'm doing
the right thing, babe.

1741
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,727
I want you to
understand something.

1742
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,272
Look at me.

1743
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:48,526
I want you to know that
nothing happened that night.

1744

Miles, you don't have to...

1745
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:55,992
Hey, babe, just...

1746
01:14:57,869 --> 01:15:01,288
I love you.

1747
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:05,000
I love you,

1748
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,920
and I would never do
anything to hurt you.

1749
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,719
Is that the whole
truth, Miles?

1750
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,181
No question, babe.

1751

something for me.

I'm glad You're here,

2089
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:44,392
'cause we got some serious
issues to talk about.

2090
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:46,978
First of all, You took
my Mother from me,

2091
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:48,396
and that just about killed me,

2092
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:52,358
but I kept my mouth shut
and let that one slide.

2093
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:56,237
I've done some bad things
to people for a lot less,

2094
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:00,366
but I've been trying to give
You the benefit of the doubt.

2095
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:02,910
I've been faithful.

2096
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,203
I been going to church,

2097
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:06,789
reading your precious
little book.

2098
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,000
I even drop stacks of
hundreds every Sunday

2099
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:13,421
in that little Velvet
bag they pass around.

2100
01:33:13,422 --> 01:33:15,631
I've changed.

2101
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:16,799
I'm a changed man,

2102
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,635
can't you see that?

2103
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:23,347
Oh, my bad.

2104
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:24,432
Of course You can.

2105
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:26,559
You see everything, right?

2106
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,770
So what's the problem, then?

2107
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:33,274
What do You want from me?

2108
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:35,651
I know I haven't made You proud.

2109
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:39,614
How could I with all this
mess I got going on?

2110
01:33:39,615 --> 01:33:42,617
What happened?

2111
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:45,244
What happened to all the things
I've been reading about?

2112
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:49,373
Grace, forgiveness, Mercy?

2113
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:51,209
Where was the Mercy
for my Mother?

2114
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,885
Now You want to take
Vanessa from me?

2115
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:06,307
Nah, that ain't gonna
happen, big guy.

2116
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:09,310
Look, I'm a stand-up guy.

2117
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:11,187
If anybody needs to
pay for they sins,

2118
01:34:11,188 --> 01:34:12,688
then let it be me.

2119
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:14,899
Please just leave
everybody else out of it.

2120
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:18,152
Just take me!

2121
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:20,154

You got coming.

2122

2124
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:28,162

Don't take Vanessa from me.

Just tell me.

01:34:44,346 --> 01:34:46,764
Look, whatever You
want me to do.

2130
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:48,057
Tell me what You want me to do

2131
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:50,935

2132
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:54,897
I didn't mean a word
I just said, Lord.

2133
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:56,942
I'm sorry for yelling
at You in Your house.

2134

But, God, You got to know
this is rough on me.

Mr. Montego,

01:37:01,817 --> 01:37:05,486
my name's Agent Carey, and
this is Agent Stokes.

We're with the IRS C.I.D.

2164
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,408
No,

2165
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,786
but I'm sure you're
about to tell me.

2167
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,499
All right, yeah, and?

2168
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,125
And, well, Mr. Montego,

2169
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:22,336
that means that we have a
series of questions for you,

2170
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:26,215
and we would appreciate your
full cooperation with them.

2171
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:28,717
Do you know these guys, Miles?

2172
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,094
Yeah, they're friends of mine.

2173
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:32,263
How good of friends?
Old friends.

2174
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:33,806
We went to school and
grew up together.

2175
01:37:33,807 --> 01:37:35,099
Why?

2176
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,226
Is that all you did
together, Miles?

2177
01:37:37,227 --> 01:37:39,061
What's that supposed to mean?

2178
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:42,773
It means that they've been
indicted on drug charges.

2179
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,567
It means that we found
these check stubs

2180
01:37:44,568 --> 01:37:47,361
that show large payments
made from your company

2181
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,196
to each of these individuals.

2182
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,907
It means that this

2183
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:54,743
looks like you're in
business with these guys,

2184
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:56,871
and if you are,

2185
01:37:56,872 --> 01:37:58,539
you're in a deep mess.

2186
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:01,542
First of all, I'm a
legitimate businessman.

2187
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:05,963
Man, I don't have any illegal
dealings of any kind.

2188
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,717
All right, so I wrote
them some checks.

2189
01:38:09,718 --> 01:38:12,261
Last time I
checked, gentlemen,

2190
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:14,096
that's still legal
in this country.

2191
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:16,098
Well, that depends on why

2192
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:18,726
the checks were issued
in the first place.

2193
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:21,312
I'm a concert promoter.

2194
01:38:21,313 --> 01:38:23,439
They invested in a
few shows of mine.

2195
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,524
Do you know your friends'
source of income?

2196
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:27,610
No, and I don't really care.

2197
01:38:27,611 --> 01:38:29,236
Well, I hate to tell
you this, Miles,

2198
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:32,281
but their problems are quickly
becoming your problems.

2199
01:38:32,282 --> 01:38:33,532
Oh! Yeah?

2200
01:38:33,533 --> 01:38:35,284
What kind of
problems are those?

2201
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:36,952
It's a problem

2202
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:39,747
when you use illegally
gotten funds

2203
01:38:39,748 --> 01:38:42,917
to fund even a legit business.

2204
01:38:42,918 --> 01:38:44,710
That makes all of its
gains and assets

2205
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:47,546
up for grabs to us.

2206
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:50,925

2208
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:55,971
Look, does it look like I'm
trying to hide anything

2209
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:58,223
from you or anybody else?

2210
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,934

you a chance here

2211
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:03,646

and dirty investigation

2212

can only hurt you.

to go down this road,

2214
01:39:08,944 --> 01:39:10,945
let's do it.

2215
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:14,448
I got a CPA that handles
all my financial affairs.

2216
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,241
I'm sure, together
with my lawyer,

2217
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:19,828
they can answer any questions
that y'all might have.

2218
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:25,668
So if y'all gonna charge and
arrest me with something,

2219
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:28,295
I suggest you go
ahead and do it

2220
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,590
so I can bail out and
go on with my day,

2221
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:34,802
but if not,

2222
01:39:34,803 --> 01:39:37,389

showed me the door.

2266
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:01,717

2268
01:43:04,012 --> 01:43:07,556

This is what the Bible says.

2322
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,455
"Consider it pure Joy

2323
01:46:18,456 --> 01:46:21,458
"whenever you face
trials of many kinds,

"the testing of your faith

develops perseverance
in your life."

2327
01:46:27,382 --> 01:46:29,132
And we should allow
perseverance

2328
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:31,134
to have her work in our life,

2329
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:36,306
because God uses that to
complete us and to mature us.

2330
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:38,308
And I'm looking at a
family here this morning

2331
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:42,854
who went through
a severe trial,

2332
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:45,357
a beast of a trial,
the Leon family.

2333
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:46,566
And you know, church,

2334
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:48,652
remember, we all
prayed for them,

2335
01:46:48,653 --> 01:46:51,488
and we asked God
to do a miracle,

2336
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:53,615
and God did answer our prayers,

2337
01:46:53,616 --> 01:46:56,118

up from her coma,

01:46:56,119 --> 01:46:58,620

want to thank God.

01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:18,557

acceptable time

2347
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:20,600

Lord Jesus Christ

2348

01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,650
that there may be
someone here today

2353
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:31,653
that would like to come
forward and kneel before us

2354

to open my life up"

I'm confessing Jesus
as my Lord today."
