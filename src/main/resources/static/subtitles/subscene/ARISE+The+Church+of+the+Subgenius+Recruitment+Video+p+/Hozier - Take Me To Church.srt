1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,400
My lover’s got humour

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,280
She’s the giggle at a funeral

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,220
Knows everybody’s disapproval

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,110
I should’ve worshiped her sooner

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,950
If the Heavens ever did speak

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,010
She is the last true mouthpiece

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,800
Every Sunday’s getting more bleak

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,660
A fresh poison each week

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,390
‘We were born sick,’ you heard them say it

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,420
My church offers no absolutes

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,020
She tells me ‘worship in the bedroom’

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,900
The only heaven I’ll be sent to

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,700
Is when I’m alone with you

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,330
I was born sick, but I love it

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,040
Command me to be well

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:57,710
Amen. Amen. Amen

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,660
Take me to church

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,250
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,080
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,710
Offer me that deathless death

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,570
Good God, let me give you my life

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,500
Take me to church

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,980
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,820
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,820
Offer me that deathless death

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,440
Good God, let me give you my life

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,040
If I’m a pagan of the good times

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,640
My lover’s the sunlight

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,310
To keep the Goddess on my side

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,260
She demands a sacrifice

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,330
To drain the whole sea

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,880
Get something shiny

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,940
Something meaty for the main course

34
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,590
That’s a fine looking high horse

35
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,550
What you got in the stable?

36
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,260
We’ve a lot of starving faithful

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,050
That looks tasty

38
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,850
That looks plenty

39
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,940
This is hungry work

40
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,860
Take me to church

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,510
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

42
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,350
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,000
Offer me that deathless death

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,840
Good God, let me give you my life

45
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,770
Take me to church

46
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,310
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

47
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,080
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

48
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,830
Offer me that deathless death

49
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,770
Good God, let me give you my life

50
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,230
No masters or kings when the ritual begins

51
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:47,220
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,640
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene

53
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,370
Only then I am human

54
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,460
Only then I am clean

55
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:18,390
Amen. Amen. Amen

56
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,060
Take me to church

57
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,660
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

58
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,400
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

59
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,200
Offer me that deathless death

60
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,900
Good God, let me give you my life

61
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,950
Take me to church

62
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,480
I’ll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

63
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,220
I’ll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Offer me that deathless death

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,900
Good God, let me give you my life
