1
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,806
Now, I know what people mean
when they say,

2
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,226
"I wish I knew then
what I knew now."

3
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,021
Ain't that the truth?

4
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,984
Probably save me a whole lot
of pain and suffering.

5
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,235
That's for sure.

6
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,531
But I guess
in the whole scheme of things,

7
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,367
it's part of God's plan,

8
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,661
and alls we can do
is just roll with it...

9
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,291
'Cause when it comes
right down to it,

10
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,628
God's running the whole show
anyways.

11
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,379
There ain't nothing we can do
to change that.

12
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,802
Believe me.
I've tried.

13
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,055
He'd say go left,

14
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,890
and I'd go right.

15
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,725
He'd say slow down,

16
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,020
and I'd smash on the gas.

17
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,855
Wasn't trying to hear
nothing he had to say.

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,902
Maybe that's why
I had to go through all this.

19
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,697
Maybe that's why things
had to happen the way they did.

20
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,907
Go, man.
Go.

21
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,288
Someone once told me

22
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,708
that God sometimes
needs to use extreme measures

23
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,503
to deal with
extreme circumstances.

24
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,339
Guess I was one of those
extreme circumstances.

25
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,009
Sometimes I feel like
God took me

26
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,845
all the way around the block

27
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,639
just to get me next door.

28
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,599
I've seen and experienced
a whole lot

29
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,810
in my short time
on this earth--

30
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,979
loved, laughed,

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,982
cried, won, lost.

32
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,859
Through it all,
I can honestly say

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,694
I don't have
too many regrets.

34
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,324
It's been
a long, long road, man.

35
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,326
Let me tell you.

36
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,954
Better yet,
let me show you.

37
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,165
Let me take you all the way
back to the beginning,

38
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,292
when life
was a little easier.

39
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,753
Well, sort of.

40
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,594
Look, y'all really need
to tighten up y'all money game

41
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,053
and stop playing around,

42
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,763
start thinking
about your future, feel me?

43
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,765
Yo, Miles,
what's there to think about?

44
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,559
We make money,
then we spend it,

45
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,810
and then we make some more.

46
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,023
Y'all think this is a joke,
man.

47
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,358
Yo, this ain't no game,
man.

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,569
Look, I spend half my time
just looking at all the angles,

49
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,404
covering all my tracks,

50
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,948
so I ain't got no problems
with the IRS or nobody else.

51
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,826
What, you think
I don't get noticed?

52
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,579
Young dude
in a $300,000 car,

53
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,165
$1-million home,

54
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,709
and mommy, daddy
ain't nowhere in sight?

55
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,670
Write a check, man.

56
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,298
Man...

57
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,300
Use a credit card
once in a while, you feel me?

58
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,760
All right, now,
let's get this money.

59
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,345
All right, man.
Check this out, Miles.

60
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,722
Say no more, partner.
I feel you, man.

61
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:42,848
I'm in it to win it.

62
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,183
Here's my cash right here.

63
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,018
Let's do it.
What y'all got?

64
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,436
Get it poppin'.
Yeah.

65
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,687
Holla.

66
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,775
Not light.
Not light.

67
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,487
All right, it's all here.
It's looking good.

68
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,530
So listen, man, we gonna
come back here tonight,

69
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,241
chop it up,
have a few drinks,

70
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,450
celebrate a little bit--

71
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,035
you know, do what we do.

72
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,787
Y'all go ahead
and get out of here, man.

73
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,206
I'll see y'all later.

74
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,042
Wik, you looking a little light,
too, over here, man.

75
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,044
You sure this is 75?

76
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,295
You crazy.

77
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,100
Is that you, Caesar?

78
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,643
No, it's me, Ma.

79
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,436
Miles?

80
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,522
What a surprise, baby.

81
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,940
What are you doing here?

82
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,149
I just came by--

83
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,818
put some paperwork
in the safe.

84
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,153
I'll be right back, okay?
All right, sweetie.

85
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,333
Ah, what you cooking on?

86
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,543
Oh, some spaghetti.

87
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,961
Looks good.
Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,754
I've always wanted
to go there.

89
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,257
What?
Sandals Resorts?

90
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,591
So why don't you go?

91
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,844
Sure.
Like it's that easy.

92
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,179
We're not all millionaires
like you, mister.

93
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,308
Stop it.

94
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,227
So how you doing, baby?

95
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,270
I'm good.

96
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,855
In fact, I'm extra good.

97
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,189
Extra good, huh?
Yeah.

98
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,858
Well, Mr. Extra Good,

99
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,319
when are you gonna give me
a grandchild, huh, mister?

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,696
There you go
talking about these grandkids.

101
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,239
Look, Ma, I told you,

102
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,408
don't be expecting no grandkids
anytime soon.

103
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,784
You need to come to church
with me

104
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,203
and find yourself
a good woman there.

105
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,872
Church, huh?

106
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,415
What, Miles?

107
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,417
You act like
you weren't raised in church.

108
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,753
I took you every Sunday.

109
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,839
Yeah, I was bored every Sunday
too, though, Ma.

110
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,842
I mean, I'm sorry,
but the music was horrible.

111
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,677
The service was gloomy.

112
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,471
All those painted pictures
in the glass

113
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,265
and them spooky little statues
all over the place?

114
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,350
I don't know.

115
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,726
Miles...

116
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,603
I mean, really,
think about it, Ma.

117
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,398
Why do you think I really got up
on Sundays to go to church?

118
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,026
'Cause I knew we'd go
to that brunch afterwards,

119
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,070
and you know I love
that buffet.

120
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,075
You go light a candle
for that one, Miles Montego,

121
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,951
because if I have to start
making you go,

122
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,203
you know I will, okay?

123
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,579
Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,122
You know that I will.
Uh-huh, I know.

125
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,957
Because you have a lot
to be grateful for.

126
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,044
I guess.

127
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,128
I tell you what, though.

128
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,129
What?

129
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,547
If you find one of those

130
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,341
nice young ladies
down at your church...

131
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,384
Mm-hmm.

132
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,802
You give them my number

133
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,136
and tell them I'm down
for whatev.

134
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,348
Whatever, huh?
Whatev.

135
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,433
Love you, Ma.
Love you too, honey.

136
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,102
All right,
I'm gonna go on and go,

137
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,645
but tell Dad I said hello,

138
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,647
and I'll holler at him later,
okay?

139
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,065
Holler?

140
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,486
What is "holler," Miles?

141
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,239
See you later, Ma.

142
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,208
Have a seat, gentlemen.

143
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,924
You know what these are?

144
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,384
These are time
and expense sheets

145
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,554
for the Montego case,

146
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,431
and you guys spent
way more time and money

147
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,682
than I ever authorized.

148
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,016
Sir, we believe
very strongly

149
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,476
that this crew
is one of the biggest

150
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,395
operating in this region,

151
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,105
with ties
with several other states.

152
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,565
This guy lives in a house
that's worth

153
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,191
more than all of our houses
put together.

154
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,693
One of his dozen cars

155
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,570
is worth more than
all of our cars combined.

156
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,822
He wears what we make
in a year on his wrist.

157
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,907
So we're working on this one
around the clock, chief.

158
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,409
Well, you ought to stop
right there,

159
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,202
'cause that's your problem.

160
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,955
You're working around the clock.

161
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,958
Now, "around the clock" costs
this office a lot of money.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,460
So what now?

163
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,087
We're gonna put a price tag
on justice?

164
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,882
This conversation is over.

165
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,050
I want a full progress
and status report

166
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,012
on my desk by the morning,

167
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,306

whether or not to shut it down.

00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,818
You in a hurry today, son?

180
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,444
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

181
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,696
Yeah.

182
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,906
Yeah, you're probably right.

183
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,366
Drivers license,
registration,

184
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,077
and proof of insurance.

185
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,008
All right, gentlemen,
listen up.

186
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,634
Shh.
And ladies.

187
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,387
Let me tell you
what we got today.

188
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,391
First up,
we got Percy Taylor,

189
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,684
aka P-body.

190
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,227
He's the muscle of this crew

191
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,479
that we've been keeping
an eye on for some time.

192
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,232
Next up we have
Martin De LaFuente.

193
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,651
He is best friends
with the leader of this crew.

194
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,070
You can be sure
wherever you see the leader,

195
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,741
you will see Mr. De LaFuente
not too far behind.

196
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,619
Next we have
Taylor Delmonico,

197
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,787
better known as "Wikki."

198
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,082
I know. I know.
I agree with you.

199
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,917
He's got a stupid name,
but don't be fooled.

200
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,879
He's just as dangerous
as the rest of this crew.

201
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,006
Next up, Chris Mayor.

202
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:34,718
Now, this guy is the number one
moneymaker for these guys.

203
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,304
Don't let his baby face
fool you either.

204
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,555
Last but not least,

205
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,973
we got the leader of this crew,

206
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,391
Miles Montego.

207
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,518
We have reason to believe

208
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,520
this guy is the biggest
drug trafficker

209
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,898
in all of northern California,

210
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,442
which is exactly why we want
to nail this guy.

211
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,820
He's smart, he's rich,
and he's good-looking,

212
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,280
but I don't
necessarily think

213
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,532
I'd want him marrying off
to my daughter.

214
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,743
All right, listen up.

215
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,495
All kidding aside,
this entire crew

216
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,665
is considered to be armed
and very, very dangerous.

217
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,209
The way they work
is very tight and efficient,

218
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,086
and they do not like anyone

219
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,338
coming between them
and their money.

220
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,550
To the money, baby!

221
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,802
To the money!

222
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,432
Yo, let me get
another round of those.

223
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,601
Yo, Miles, let me holla at you
right quick, dog.

224
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,436
What's happening?

225
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,691
Yo, man,
check this out, dog.

226
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,859
I know you don't like to hear
this kind of stuff no more--

227
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,027
and I get that dog,
I do--

228
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,113
but your boy Jesse,

229
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,031
he owe me a whole lot of loot,
dog.

230
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,449
He been giving me
the runaround

231
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,243
for, like, the past
two, three weeks, homey.

232
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,245
All right, Marty.

233
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,080
This is the last time.

234
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,331
Like I told you before, man,

235
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,083
I don't want
to hear nothing

236
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,710
about no what, when, why--

237
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,587
none of that, you feel me?

238
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,006
I feel you, boss.
I'm serious about this, man.

239
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,476
Nick.

240
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,853
How you doing?

241
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,312
I'm doing good.
I'm hanging in.

242
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,856
Not as good as you.

243
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,733
You got to learn to leave
some of that cash around

244
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,317
so we can make some.

245
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,902
Aah, stop it, man.

246
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,321
Anyway, look,
it's the Fourth of July weekend,

247
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,741
and I got a real great
group of people coming over.

248
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,284
I got steaks from Argentina.

249
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,327
I got lobsters from Maine.

250
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,455
All I need is for you to come by
and hang out

251
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,582
so I don't feel like
I only know old people.

252
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,125
Sounds good, Nick.
You know what?

253
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,543
I think I'm gonna
take you up on that.

254
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,170
Yeah?
So you gonna come by?

255
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,130
I'll probably shoot over there
in about an hour.

256
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,506
Okay, good.

257
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,799
I'll see you in a bit, then,
okay?

258
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,509
All right, cool.
Okay, good.

259
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,054
♪ 'Cause I'm ready to give
right now ♪

260
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,890
♪ And I'm ready for love
right now ♪

261
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,725
Yo, Miles!

262
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,727
My youngest and coolest
friend in the world.

263
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,062
You made it, man.
Yep.

264
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,231
Hey, everybody, I told you
I got cool friends!

265
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,816
This is Miles.
Man, get out of here.

266
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,485
I'm trying to get like you
when I get older.

267
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,778
Old?
Who you calling old?

268
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,237
Yeah,
you putting on a little, man.

269
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,323
I'm putting it on.

270
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,949
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So who you with?

271
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,785
I'm solo today.
Solo?

272
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,496
Well, just don't let money
run your life, Miles.

273
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,622
Otherwise,
you're gonna end up

274
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,040
like these guys out here.

275
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,333
They look like they doing
all right to me.

276
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,959
I'm serious, Miles.

277
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,170
I'm asking one of these guys
to pass the chips,

278
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,505
and he wants to ask me

279
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,340
what the market closed at
yesterday.

280
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,175
Come on, man.
Get a life.

281
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,010
I used to be the same way,
Miles.

282
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,846
But my career
almost cost me my family,

283
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,890
and it got to the point
where me and Karen--

284
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,433
we didn't know each other
anymore.

285
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,144
She said the only thing
that kept us together

286
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,146
was answered prayers
from her church group,

287
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,565
so I had to commit
to going to church every Sunday

288
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,984
as a family
and one date night a week.

289
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,862
I never figured you
to be a religious guy, Nick.

290
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,572
Well, we really don't like

291
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,282
that word "religious,"
Miles.

292
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,785
It's kind of like
the word "margin call"

293
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,411
in the stock market.

294
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,121
I'd prefer "man of faith."

295
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,790
All right, guys,
food is ready.

296
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,041
Oh, let's eat.

297
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,922
So can we all gather around

298
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,757
and have a word of prayer
before we eat?

299
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,634
First,
I'd like to thank you all

300
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,469
for coming to our home today.

301
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,471
We are so thankful
and blessed

302
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,057
to have such wonderful people
in our lives

303
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,686
and so happy that you were able
to come over and join--

304
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,480
Honey, could you, um,
get to the prayer?

305
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,691
I mean, this is not the Oscars.
Everybody's starving.

306
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,403
Well, I was just about
to thank my wonderful husband

307
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,613
for putting this all together,
but...

308
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,533
I guess I'll just get
straight to the point.

309
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:30,370
Dear Father, thank You
for this glorious day.

310
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:33,248
It's easy to believe in You,
to have faith in You,

311
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,959
when we're blessed
with such beautiful weather,

312
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,586
such delicious food,

313
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,962
but most importantly,

314
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,505
for the friends and family
that we have

315
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,842
joining us
to enjoy this today.

316
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,844
For this and more,
we give You thanks.

317
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,095
Amen.

318
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,513
Amen.
Amen.

319
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,265
Amen.

320
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,938
Oh, that's Vanessa.

321
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,109
She goes to Bible study
every week with my wife.

322
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,444
Hmm.

323
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,862
Bible study, huh?

324
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,281
Mm, Bible study.

325
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,116
She come over a lot?

326
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,035
Come on.

327
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,079
Miles!

328
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,497
Hey, ladies,
how y'all doing?

329
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,999
I'd like to introduce you

330
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,834
to some of my girlfriends
from Bible study.

331
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,461
This is Shari...
Hey, Miles.

332
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,254
Maylin...
Nice to meet you.

333
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,048
And Sarah.
Pleasure to meet you, Miles.

334
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,674
You as well.
And then there's Vanessa.

335
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,301
Hi, how are you?
How are you?

336
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,304
I'm good.
Miles is a very cool name.

337
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,014
Thank you.

338
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,768
Uh, can I get my hand back
before I call 911?

339
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,894
Rm 50"'!!-

340
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,771
It's cool.

341
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,524
Hey, Dad, watch this!

342
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,360
So how do you know
the Halston family?

343
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,153
You know, Nick's my broker
and my money guy,

344
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,781
so we hang out
from time to time.

345
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,367
So young and into stocks.

346
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,452
So how do you know
Nick and Karen?

347
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,704
We actually all go to
the same church and Bible study.

348
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,081
Okay.

349
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,499
So you go to church
on Sundays, then?

350
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,459
Yes, sir.
Every Sunday.

351
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,753
So, uh, what was
your religion again?

352
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,213
I guess I'm "Christian,"
but, you know,

353
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,631
we don't really
like to call it that.

354
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,258
Right, right.
You like to say "men of faith."

355
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,677
Or in your case,
it would be "woman of faith."

356
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,886
Exactly,
so you know exactly

357
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,221
what I'm talking about,
right?

358
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,847
Well, yeah,
doesn't everybody?

359
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,100
What church do you attend?

360
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,561
Oh, well, right now,
I'm kind of in between churches.

361
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,314
Between churches, huh?

362
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,482
Yeah.

363
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,401
In between churches.

364
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,777
All right, well,
what was the name

365
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,195
of the last church
you attended?

366
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,197
I really don't remember,

367
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,200
but I'm sure I could call my mom
and she, you know--

368
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,661
You are so playing with me
right now, Mr. Miles.

369
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,329
All right, you caught me.

370
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,748
But I do go to church
on Easter Sundays with my mom,

371
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,376
and on Christmas, I mean,
if that counts for anything.

372
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,004
Look, I grew up
in a Catholic church,

373
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,422
but, you know, I don't know--

374
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,632
I never really stuck with it.

375
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,927
I think I just didn't
feel comfortable in my church.

376
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,471
Well, you should find a church
you do feel comfortable at

377
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,056
and stick with it.

378
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,575
Wow, I guess we shut
this joint down, didn't we?

379
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,993
We sure did.

380
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,329
So you think
somewhere between school

381
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,331
and saving the world,

382
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,417
you could make a little time
so I could see you again?

383
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,004
Please, Miles,
my life is not that serious.

384
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,007
But yes, I'd love to.

385
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,592
Great.
Hold on.

386
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,093
Give me your phone.

387
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,344
Okay, here we go.

388
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,015
I got a good idea.

389
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,600
How about we not play

390
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,518
the "who can wait the longest
to call who" game?

391
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,978
Yeah, I don't like
that game either.

392
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,646
Okay, I got a better one.

393
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,857
How about we play the
"who can call who first" game?

394
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,067
Ah, see, I'm into that.

395
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,485
I'm into that, too.

396
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,490
Yo, it's definitely time
for me to go.

397
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,158
Yeah.

398
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,329
So, uh, I guess I'll
be talking to you tomorrow?

399
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,747
Soon?

400
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,835
Not if I talk to you first.

401
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:14,552
Yo, we in San Jose,
not San Francisco.

402
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,553
Yo, you good?

403
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,616
Good morning, Vanessa.

404
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,954
Mmmmm.

405
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,664
See what she talking about...

406
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,295
Good morning, Mr. Miles.

407
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,131
Look, I know
it's a little early,

408
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,676
but, you know, my Sundays start
when the sun comes up.

409
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,511
Just wanted to say
that I really enjoyed

410
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,513
meeting you yesterday,

411
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,890
and hopefully I look forward
to hanging out with you again.

412
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,602
Well, have a blessed day,
Mr. Miles Montego.

413
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,729
By the way, I win the game.

414
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,357
Peace.

415
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,708
Hello?

416
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,711
Well, aren't we
quite the busy bee at 6:00 a.m.?

417
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,173
You're awake?
Ain't no question.

418
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,342
My days usually start
at 5:00 a.m. anyway, so...

419
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,552
5:00 a.m.?
What are you?

420
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,054
Like, a baker?
Nah.

421
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,681
You know, I deal a lot
with the east coast,

422
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,308
so the time difference
gets me up.

423
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,726
Okay, big shot.

424
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,352
So how about it?

425
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,104
Want to come to church
with me today?

426
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,772
You know what?

427
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,400
I got a gang of stuff
I got to get done by tomorrow,

428
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,611
but I'll definitely take
a rain check on it

429
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,070
if that's all right
with you.

430
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,906
Of course.

431
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,325
Yeah, anytime.

432
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,952
Well, I actually got to run
right now,

433
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,454
but maybe we could talk later?

434
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,456
How about we leave
the maybes out of this

435
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,041
and just get together

436
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,667
after we done doing
what we both got to do?

437
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,860
Not only does he get to flaunt
all that money around town,

438
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,946
but he gets
the pretty girls, too.

439
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,951
Is that a little jealousy
I'm sensing, McDaniel?

440
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,828
Oh, no, it's not jealousy.

441
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,080
When I slap the cuffs
on this guy

442
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,623
and he gets 25 to life

443
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:52,460
while I'm home
all warm and cozy in my bed,

444
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,128
that's when you'll see
some jealousy.

445
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,648
You live here by yourself?

446
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,650
Well, yeah,
unless there's some roaches

447
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,568
I don't know about.

448
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,535
Miles, this place
is beautiful.

449
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,953
Thanks, babe.
I'm glad you like it.

450
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,454
Like it?

451
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,456
I love it.

452
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,084
So how many bedrooms
does it have?

453
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,087
Uh, last time I checked,
eight.

454
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,172
Eight bedrooms
for one person?

455
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,883
Now, why would you buy a house
with eight bedrooms?

456
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,927
I needed
some extra closet space.

457
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,095
I'm playing.
I'm playing.

458
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,388
You so wrong.

459
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,015
I'm joking.
I'm joking.

460
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,683
Oh, even the kitchen
is sick.

461
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,892
You cook?

462
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,352
I do a little something.

463
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,313
You know, maybe
you come over one night and...

464
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,731
put something together
for you.

465
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,149
Okay.

466
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,361
So this big house,
for one person?

467
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,572
I don't use all this space.

468
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,158
I usually end up sleeping
on the couches half the time.

469
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,286
Yo, I always pass this place,

470
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,079
but I've never actually
eaten here.

471
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,164
Yeah?

472
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,540
I hope you're hungry,

473
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,751
'cause the food here
is amazing.

474
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,504
Oh, my goodness.

475
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,797
No, I know.
You got to get it.

476
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,882
I got to take this one.

477
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,133
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,636
Yo.

479
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,430
Hey, what's buzzin', cousin?

480
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,724
T, what's going on, man?
What's happening?

481
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,601
I'm just trying to make
a dollar out of 15 cents.

482
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,019
You know.

483
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,562
So, hey, did you fire off
that package?

484
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,230
Oh, yeah, man,
that should be on your desk

485
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,232
by tomorrow morning,
probably around 10:00.

486
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,068
Man, I like your style,
Miles.

487
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,236
So you all locked and loaded
on your end, right?

488
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,905
Oh, yeah, for sure, man.

489
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,948
Everything's set up
just the way we planned it, man.

490
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,575
I got y'all hooked up, man,

491
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,035
so I'll see y'all
in a couple of weeks.

492
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,620
One love, baby.

493
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,456
What do you make of this,
Brian?

494
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,250
You ever hear
of this guy T before?

495
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,753
Can't say that I have.

496
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,339
Where'd the call come from?

497
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,883
Cell phone outside of Ohio.

498
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,093
Could be one of his clients,

499
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,887
maybe even a connection.

500
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,555
That would be my guess.

501
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,435
This is good, right?

502
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,520
Yeah.

503
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,771
Real good.

504
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,775
Do you have to go?

505
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,235
'Cause I would totally
understand.

506
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,903
Oh, no, no, no.
Know what?

507
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,447
Matter of fact, let me
turn this phone off right now

508
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,282
so we can enjoy our dinner.

509
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,326
Don't you dare, Miles.
No, no, it's okay, really.

510
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,744
Yo, it's clearly business.

511
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,580
Like, I would never ask you
to do that.

512
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,917
You know what?
That's dope.

513
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,669
I mean, you know,
a lot of women,

514
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,422
they'd be like, you know,
"You're being rude,"

515
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:46,050
or, you know,
"Could you turn that off?"

516
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,387
Anyways,
so did the stock market

517
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,763
get you all of this--

518
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,390
the house, the cars,
the jewelry--

519
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:55,977
or did you, like, run into some
amazing family fortune?

520
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,437
Actually,
I like to keep my hands

521
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,938
in a lot of different things.

522
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,940
You know, right now,
I got a string of shows

523
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,483
that I'm doing right here
in the Bay.

524
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,068
Matter of fact,
I'm doing three shows.

525
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,904
I got one in Frisco,
one in Oakland,

526
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,739
and I'm doing one right here
in San Jose.

527
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,367
Wow, Miles, that's--
that's exciting.

528
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,372
You know, I was thinking,
um...

529
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,166
I don't know--
maybe you might want

530
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,793
to come hang out with me
for a couple of the shows.

531
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,004
You ain't got to go
to all of them, but you know...

532
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:27,842
Mr. Miles, are you
asking me on another date?

533
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:32,054
Why, I think I am,
Miss Vanessa.

534
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,931
I'd love that.

535
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,224
Well, then it's a date.

536
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,901
Look, Miles, I really
had a good time tonight.

537
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,277
You know,
I really did, too.

538
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,653
I'm not just saying that!

539
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,448
Me neither.
I had a great time.

540
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,283
Yo, I still cannot believe

541
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,286
you spent all this money
on this big house

542
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,704
to live in it by yourself.

543
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,164
Really?
I don't know.

544
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,249
Well, maybe one day,
I'll find somebody

545
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,252
to, you know, fill it.

546
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,879
I mean, does it really
make a difference

547
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,672
if I get the house first

548
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,674
and then find somebody special
to share it with?

549
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,510
I guess not.
No.

550
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,847
Silver convertible, huh?

551
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,599
Yep.
And?

552
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,602
You want to hear
a funny story?

553
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:20,811
Sure.

554
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,232
A few weeks ago,
I'm driving,

555
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,235
and I come to this stop sign,

556
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,237
and I look over
at the intersection,

557
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,448
and I see this convertible,

558
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,201
but what really caught my eye
was this--

559
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:38,329
this beautiful woman
that was driving.

560
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:42,750
I mean, she had, like,
long, beautiful black hair

561
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,127
kind of like yours.

562
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,504
And she was wearing
these shades--

563
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,089
these really hot shades.

564
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,509
I mean, I was on her.

565
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,136
I felt like
I had to catch her.

566
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,848
So I--
you know, I get in pursuit.

567
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,642
I'm holding up traffic.

568
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:03,062
I'm bobbing and weaving
in between cars.

569
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:06,065
Anyway, to make
a long story short,

570
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,818
I get pulled over
by the police,

571
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,612
but you know what really,
really bothered me?

572
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,074
What?

573
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,495
Was that I didn't get a chance
to meet her.

574
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,540
I didn't get a chance
to know who she was.

575
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,421
What kind of car
did you say this was?

576
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,425
Um, hmm.

577
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,722
A silver convertible Sebring.

578
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,411
Oh, my gosh.

579
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,829
What?
Oh, my gosh.

580
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,331
Yo, he's in the store.

581
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,749
The guy you just met?
Yes, he's in the--

582
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,916
Miles?
Where?

583
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,501
Don't say his name so loud.

584
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,128
He's gonna hear you.
Girl, he is so fine.

585
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,129
Ooh, he sure is.

586
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,714
I so hate you right now.

587
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:12,965
Well, don't just stand there.

588
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,300
Go over there and talk to him.

589
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,760
We all know
he didn't come here

590
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,928
to buy a Jesus bumper sticker
for his Bentley.

591
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,180
Go.

592
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,852
Hey, you.
Hey.

593
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,395
What are you doing here?

594
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,855
You know,
I was in the neighborhood.

595
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,398
Thought I'd stop by
and surprise you.

596
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,025
Well, I am surprised.

597
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,443
I love the spot.

598
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,195
What kind of store is this?
Thank you.

599
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,197
We are a faith-based
product store.

600
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,990
Okay.

601
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:41,410
So I guess
there's a pretty big market

602
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,120
for this church stuff, huh?

603
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,538
That's right.

604
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,374
Aw, they look really cute
together.

605
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,626
She looks really happy.
Yeah, I know.

606
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,628
Her last boyfriend
was such a jerk.

607
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,838
We have, like,
a bunch of T-shirts

608
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,467
and, you know, books, and CDs
that are Christ-like themed.

609
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,260
Stuff like that.

610
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,804
And these are all
Christian artists?

611
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,597
That's right.

612
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,475
This dude right here
looks like a real rapper.

613
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,102
Come on, Miles.
He is a real rapper.

614
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,728
He just, you know,
raps about the Lord.

615
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,480
Nah, nah, nah.
That's not what I'm saying.

616
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,108
I mean, look, this dude
looks like a gangster,

617
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,110
and the music that was playing
when I came in

618
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,736
made me feel like
I wanted to stage dive.

619
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,989
Yo, you never listened
to Christian music?

620
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,449
Nah.

621
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,076
I mean, well, you know,
my moms used to play,

622
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,911
like, Elvis Presley gospel
albums on Sundays,

623
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,080
but other than that, nah.

624
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:27,498
Well, yo,
I am about to hook you up

625
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,333
with some really, really hot
Christian music,

626
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,710
hold on a sec.
I'ma get you some CDs.

627
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,420
Okay.

628
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,629
T-bone...

629
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,256
Bone-a-fide.

630
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,260
What you got for me?

631
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,387
All right, so I hooked you up
with some really hot CDs.

632
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,097
Trust me, you have to listen
to this, Miles.

633
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,223
You're really gonna like it.

634
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,224
If you say so.

635
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,767
How much I owe you?

636
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,477
Consider it a gift
from me to you.

637
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,813
Okay.
I love gifts.

638
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,815
Oh, look, look,
I got a birthday party

639
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,608
that I'm going to tonight.

640
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,735
You want to go?

641
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,154
A party?
Yeah.

642
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,864
I might be able to,
you know, swing it.

643
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,365
All right.
How does 7:00 sound?

644
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,033
All right, cool,
you pick me up at my spot,

645
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,243
and then you can meet my family.

646
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,661
Meet the family?

647
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,455
This is getting serious now,
huh?

648
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,039
Oh, please.
They don't bite.

649
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,166
Sure about that?

650
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,542
Yes.

651
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:12,835
All right,
I'll see you at 7:00.

652
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,589
Oh, my gosh.

653
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,674
Mad cute, right?

654
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,176
He's gonna meet my parents
tonight.

655
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:28,559
Seriously, is someone
gonna get that?

656
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,437
Hold on.

657
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,357
Have mercy!

658
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,401
I got to call you back.

659
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,778
Hi.
Hey, how you doing?

660
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,862
I'm Alyssa.

661
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,197
I'm Miles.

662
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,741
I'm here to pick up
Vanessa.

663
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,117
Figures.

664
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,204
Vanessa,
somebody's here for you!

665
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,831
Mom, have you seen
my phone charger?

666
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,833
Hey, you must be Miles.

667
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,419
Hi, I'm Julissa,
Vanessa's younger sister.

668
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,754
Do all you guys yell
around here?

669
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,088
You're killing me right now.

670
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,799
Yeah, pretty much.
Loud as can be.

671
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,383
Well, it was nice
meeting you.

672
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,635
You too.

673
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,850
Hello, I'm Miguel Leon,
and you are?

674
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,018
How you doing, Mr. Leon?

675
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,603
I'm Miles Montego.

676
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,564
Wow, Miles Montego sounds like
a secret agent name.

677
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:16,941
Man of mystery.

678
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,442
Well, sorry to disappoint,

679
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,069
but no mystery here.

680
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,655
What you see is what you get.

681
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,281
Honey, this is Miles.

682
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,742
He's here to pick up Vanessa.

683
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,953
On.

684
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,956
You're Miles?

685
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,708
Uh, yeah,
last time I checked.

686
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,545
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Leon.

687
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,089
And what church do you go to,
Miles?

688
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,423
Wow.

689
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,843
Well, um,
I'm kind of looking

690
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,052
for a new church
right now.

691
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,679
On.

692
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,514
And what is it that you do?

693
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,349
Honey,
enough drilling already.

694
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,809
Well, I just want to know

695
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,394
who our daughter's
hanging out with.

696
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,020
All right, well,
I see you've met everyone.

697
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,355
We're gonna head on out,
you guys.

698
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:57,648
Good night.
Love you, Dad, bye.

699
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,650
Good-bye.
It was nice meeting you.

700
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,988
♪ I want you
to possess my body ♪

701
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,407
What's happening?
Could it really be?

702
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,534
Is it Miles Montego?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

703
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,369
What up, baby?
What's happening?

704
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,788
Montego, wait a minute--
I thought you left the country.

705
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,206
You lucky you showed up,
homey.

706
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,250
I was gonna go straight
to your house from here.

707
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,460
You know I wouldn't have
missed that for nothing, man.

708
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,212
Appreciate that.

709
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:22,631
Fellas, I want y'all to meet
my new lady right here.

710
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:23,883
This is Vanessa.

711
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,801
Vanessa, that's Chris.
Hi.

712
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:28,637
That's Wikki, Percy,
and this one right here,

713
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,639
that's my right-hand man,
Marty.

714
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,141
Hey, Marty.

715
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,767
It's such a pleasure
to meet you guys.

716
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,728
You know, Miles talks about
you guys all the time.

717
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,354
Yo, let's go inside
and get some drinks.

718
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,981
Man, let's do it right.
Come on.

719
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,191
Thank you, baby.
Yeah.

720
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,402
Don't let me see you
around here again!

721
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:44,987
You all right, baby?
Yeah.

722
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:46,447
Miles!

723
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,240
Bootz, man, you always
up to something, man.

724
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,700
What's going on?
Nothing much, man.

725
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:50,743
All right.
All right.

726
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,036
What's up, big homey?

727
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,204
Good to see you, man.

Hey, Jerry,
what's going on, baby?

You what's up.

Oh, Vanessa,

740
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,268
this is Jerry Rice,

741
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,436
one of the greatest receivers

742
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:18,437
to ever play the game.

743
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,564
Jerry, this is my girl, Vanessa.

744
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,941
I know who he is.

745
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,442
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Rice.

746
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:24,818
Oh, "Jerry," please,

747
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,320
and it's my pleasure
to meet you.

748
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:27,821
I want to wish you guys
a good night,

749
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,490
but also, Miles,
I don't want you to forget

750
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,908
about those tickets
for that show.

751
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,828
Oh, Jerry, come on,
I got you, baby.

752
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,789
And, Vanessa,
it's really nice to meet you.

753
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,040
Pleasure meeting you.

754
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,044
Yo, babe,
you know Jerry Rice?

755
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,213
Oh, yeah,
Jerry's a good dude--

756
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,839
Babe,
my dad is gonna trip out

757
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,758
when he finds out
I met Jerry Rice!

758
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,512
Hey!
How are you?

759
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,807
Ladies, I want y'all to meet
my baby, Vanessa.

760
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,892
Vanessa, this is Nicole,

761
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,102
Jasmine,

762
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,353
that's Simone,

763
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:00,396
and this is Shanice.

764
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,356
Nice to meet you guys.

765
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,984
Hey, yo, what's good, Chico?
Let's have some shots, man.

766
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,486
Ah, not tonight, Marty, man.
I'm driving.

767
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,238
Not tonight?
Man, it's my birthday, homey.

768
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,948
I mean, that's why we all here
celebrating.

769
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,158
I mean, just one shot, man.

770
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,451
All right, maybe later.

771
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,828
Psh, man,
I remember that one time

772
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,204
he was hanging out the window

773
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,747
with guns blazing
like a madman like--

774
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,668
Hey, Vanessa,
you don't even know.

775
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,169
Miles Montego?

776
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,713
You're sitting
with a real legend, Ma.

777
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,172
I seen my man--

778
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,299
Let's go get that shot
on me.

779
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,551
Yeah, yeah.

780
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,055
♪ Supersonic,
cybertronic ♪

781
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,390
♪ All up on it ♪

782
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,683
♪ No need for that
gin and tonic ♪

783
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,393
So, Vanessa,

784
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,604
is everything they say
about Miles true?

785
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,814
About what?

786
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,275
You know.

787
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:47,901
Oh, wow.

788
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,739
Um, I'm not trying
to keep you girls in suspense,

789
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,365
but I wouldn't know.

790
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,744
You mean you two
haven't slept together yet?

791
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,787
Look, we're just trying
to, you know, take it slow.

792
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,581
That's all.
Nice and slow?

793
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,624
Are we talking about
the same Miles here?

794
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,336
So what,
y'all trying to make me

795
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,965
look like a psycho or something?

796
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,177
She ain't trying
to hear all that, man.

797
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:16,388
Does she look
like she's impressed?

798
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,059
Do me a favor.
Tone it down.

799
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,435
Tone it down, man.

800
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,690
Just saying, man.
Just saying.

801
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,359
You went out there,
talking all that stuff, man...

802
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,153
I'ma finish his drink.

803
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,697
Wow, that was...

804
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,034
quite an evening.

805
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,869
Babe, I am so sorry.

806
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,537
I thought they'd act way cooler
than that.

807
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,955
You don't have to say
you're sorry.

808
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,373
Everybody has a past.

809
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,625
We all do.

810
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,376
Yeah.

811
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,546
You know you can talk to me
about anything, right, baby?

812
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,798
Yeah.

813
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:55,010
Look, I got a past, baby.

814
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:58,055
One I'm not
particularly proud of.

815
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,102
And if you were
to hear about it...

816
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,354
I don't know, I--

817
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:09,191
I feel like you might not want
to see me no more,

818
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:11,068
and that kind of scares me,
babe.

819
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,694
Miles, what's the matter?

820
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:24,790
Look, I know this great
little restaurant.

821
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,125
Great coffee.

822
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,752
Best pie in town.

823
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,003
I mean, if that's all right.

824
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,341
Sure.

825
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,011
Let's go.

826
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,518
What's wrong, Lydia?

827
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,353
Please go to sleep.

828
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,813
Sleep?

829
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,439
How can you sleep
when our daughter's out

830
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,983
with that--
that--

831
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,401
That boy.

832
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,945
He's a boy, Lydia.

833
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,446
Well,
I got a really bad vibe

834
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,491
from that so-called boy,
Miguel.

835
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,326
He doesn't seem her type.

836
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,538
According to you,
she'll never have a type.

837
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,124
Please go to sleep.

838
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,178
Now, promise me
you're gonna have an open mind

839
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,846
and not freak out on me.

840
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:23,098
I promise.

841
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,017
What'd you think
about my friends tonight?

842
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,522
They looked like gangsters
and drug dealers.

843
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,734
That's because they are, V.

844
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,945
I mean, they're not, like,
Mafia or anything,

845
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,156
but they live that lifestyle,

846
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,575
and to be honest,
I used to live just like them.

847
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,535
In fact,

848
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,454
they all used to work for me.

849
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,792
Work for you?

850
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,212
Doing what?

851
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,379
Here we go.

852
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,631
Thank you.

853
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,802
Folks, let me know if
there's anything else you need.

854
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,012
Yep.
Thank you.

855
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,264
Work for you doing what?

856
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,892
I used to be a drug dealer,
Vanessa,

857
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,353
and those guys you met
tonight,

858
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,980
that was my crew.

859
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,775
I mean, basically,
we was into any and everything.

860
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,615
Wow, Miles, I don't--

861
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,450
I don't even know
what to say.

862
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,706
Look.

863
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,460
I don't talk about it
'cause I'm not proud of it.

864
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,962
I mean, I don't know
how I did it.

865
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:38,048
I don't even know why I did it.
I just did.

866
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,300
But I can honestly say

867
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,177
I'm a better man
from all of that.

868
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,225
Wow, Miles.

869
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:51,144
Well,
about your friends, baby,

870
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,356
the Bible says that bad company
corrupts good character.

871
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,109
You really think
this is a wise idea,

872
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,610
still hanging out
with these guys

873
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,445
when they do what they do?

874
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,656
Those are my friends, V.

875
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,533
I mean, those dudes--

876
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,243
they're like my family,

877
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,203
and I can count on them
for anything.

878
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,871
Look, I've been trying
to tell these guys

879
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,874
there's other ways
to make legal money.

880
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,710
I mean, I spent
the last two years of my life

881
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,297
just trying
to wash and shake all that off.

882
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,132
Shake it off, huh?

883
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,342
Look, I'm not
this perfect guy, V,

884
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,845
but I'm trying.

885
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,645
Miles,
that was a mouthful.

886
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,063
To be honest with you, babe,

887
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,483
it almost sounds like
a testimony

888
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,445
of someone who's had their life
turned around by God.

889
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,658
Thank you

890
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,161
for even wanting
to share that with me.

891
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,829
Am I okay with it?

892
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,125
I don't know about all that.

893
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,421
Does it make me
want to pull away from you?

894
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,301
No.

895
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,428
If anything, it...

896
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,388
makes me want to get closer
to you.

897
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,353
Would it be wrong to say

898
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,063
that I'm falling in love
with you?

899
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,360
No, baby,

900
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,362
'cause I'm falling in love
with you, too.

901
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,009
Well, since you just
had the floor, Scarface--

902
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,220
Oh, I'm Scarface now, huh?

903
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,763
Yeah, it's my turn now.

904
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,516
Baby, do you know
what "equally yoked" means?

905
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,851
What do you mean,
like eggs or something?

906
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,436
No, silly.

907
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,731
In the Bible, God refers
to our spirits as equally yoked,

908
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:04,152
so in order for you and I
to be equally yoked,

909
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,196
it means that we have to feel
the same way

910
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,865
about each other and God

911
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,577
and put Jesus in the center
of this relationship.

912
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,830
Now, do you think
you can do that?

913
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,623
I mean, it sounds
like a whole lot, babe,

914
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:20,043
but I care about you enough

915
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,296
to give it a try.

916
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,938
Good morning, sunshine.

917
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,621
So it's the big weekend,
eh, Miles?

918
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,664
I hope so.

919
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,416
So these are your events?

920
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,126
Yeah, well, you know,
I got a few partners,

921
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,961
but yeah, for the most part.

922
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,172
Well, we'll say a prayer
for you and your shows tonight.

923
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,631
Thanks, Mr. Leon.
I appreciate it.

924
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,277
Tams, what's going on?

925
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,987
How we looking?
Everything's great.

926
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,572
The groups are checked in
to the hotel.

927
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:31,907
Sound check's going on
right now.

928
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,116
You got yourself a sellout.

929
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,118
That's what I'm talking about.

930
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,162

00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,029
You.

951
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,991
That is not how I act,
talk, or any of that.

952
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,993
You were amazing today.

953
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,202
Amazing.

954
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,787
Like, honestly,
I was so impressed

955
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:03,331
with just the way
the whole show came together.

956
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:05,250
Really?
Yeah.

957
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:06,876
I'm glad you liked it,
baby.

958
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,087
Loved it.

959
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:11,089
Well, we should get some rest,

960
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,717
'cause tomorrow's gonna be
a long day.

961
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,720
Yeah.

962
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,557
Where are you going?

963
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,976
Oh, see,
you can lay back down,

964
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:24,811

967
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,108
I have the king-size bed.

968
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,154
Love you.

969
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,572

What about these?

976
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,394
Oh, I'm into that, too.

977
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,229
You like them?
Yeah, those are really hot.

978
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,482
I'll take them in every color.

979
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,858
Yo, we should take
a little break

980
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,318
and actually
get something to eat.

981
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,736
Yeah?
You hungry?

982
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:16,029
I know a spot up here.
It's nice.

983
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,030
Key word "break."

984
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,073
I'm not done.

985
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,240
I'm not done shopping.

986
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,950
Ain't that something?
Miles?

987
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,494
Celine.

988
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,121
Where have you been?

989
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,831
I've been calling and calling.

990
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,000
I just--I been
rippin' and runnin'.

991
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,168
You ready, babe?

992
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,670
Oh, I'm sorry.

993
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,754
V, this is Celine.

994
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:34,381
Celine, this is Vanessa.

995
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,049
Oh, how do you do?

996
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,676
Fine.

997
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,094
Celine's a old friend of mine.

998
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,470
Really?

999
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,013
Okay, well, babe,
the kids are ready,

1000
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,640
and, you know,
the jet is waiting.

1001
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:45,642
Wheels up at 6:00.

1002
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:46,935
It was nice meeting you.

1003
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,708
For real?

1004
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,169
Kids waiting?

1005
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,088
Wheels up at 6:00?

1006
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,589
Where'd you get all that from?

1007
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,591
I watch the E! Channel.

1008
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,093
Did you sleep with her?

1009
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,140
Yeah.

1010
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:28,601
I shouldn't have even asked.

1011
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:29,853
So why did you?

1012
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,399
Women.

1013
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,827
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

1014
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,579
Get out the car, homey.

1015
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,372
Get out the car!

1016
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:50,999
Don't do it.

1017
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,002
Open the door, Jesse!

1018
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,462
Get out.

1019
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,088
Miles, don't--
Miles, don't do it.

1020
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,506
Miles!
Lock the door and get down.

1021
00:45:58,548 --> 00:45:59,632
Oh... my!

1022
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,635
Come on, punk.

1023
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,928
Ya! Yo, yo, ya, ya-

1024
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,680
Get up, homey.

1025
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:06,890
What's up, dag?

1026
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,141
Get him, Miles!

1027
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,147
Back up.

1028
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,149
Is there a problem here?

1029
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,567
Jesse,
is there a problem here?

1030
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:18,860
Man, just shoot him,
Miles!

1031
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:20,445
Shoot this punk!
Nah, nah, nah.

1032
00:46:20,487 --> 00:46:21,946
Ain't nobody gonna get shot
tonight.

1033
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,698
What we gonna do is, Jesse,

1034
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,825
you gonna get in your car,
and you gonna get out of here.

1035
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,410
You hear what I'm saying
to you?

1036
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,245
Get in your car
and get out of here!

1037
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,797
This ain't over, punk.

1038
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,800
See you around, homey.

1039
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:44,010
Let's go, man.
Let's go.

1040
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:46,638
Meet me at the spot,

1041
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,223
and make sure
nobody follows y'all.

1042
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,503
Baby.

1043
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:19,629
Baby, are you all right?

1044
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,923
Are you okay?
Babe!

1045
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,925
No, I'm not okay, Miles.

1046
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,135
Who were those guys?
Were they trying to kill you?

1047
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,012
Look, baby, just relax.

1048
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,139
Just relax.
It had nothing to do with me.

1049
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,058
Look, I was just trying
to defuse the situation.

1050
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,309
That's it.

1051
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,894
It had nothing to do
with you.

1052
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:36,604
It was between Martin
and whoever that guy was.

1053
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:40,275
So what am I supposed to do,
babe,huh?

1054
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,568
Leave him out there alone?

1055
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,403
Let some dude
come blow his head off?

1056
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,113
Is that what you telling me?

1057
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,698
Don't think so, baby.

1058
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,491
So you're just willing
to give up everything

1059
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,243
including your own life

1060
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,537
for something that had nothing
to do with you?

1061
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,455
Yeah.

1062
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:57,292
And they would do the same
for me, baby.

1063
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,878
Look, a few years ago,

1064
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:03,006
this whole thing would have
turned out a lot different.

1065
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,966
I was just trying to get us
out of there safe, baby.

1066
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:05,967
That's it.

1067
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:07,594
Really?

1068
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,012
Would you like to tell me

1069
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,139
why there was a gun
in your car?

1070
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,307
Babe, it's like I told you.

1071
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,850
Whenever I do shows like this,

1072
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:15,852
there's always large amounts
of cash around.

1073
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:17,270
You know that!
You see it!

1074
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,272
Look!

1075
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:22,692
What do you want me to do?

1076
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,695
Listen, I know this whole
situation and everything,

1077
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:28,323
it's all new for you,

1078
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,991
but you got to understand,
babe,

1079
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:34,621
when it comes to protecting you,
my family, my friends,

1080
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,123
I'll do anything, babe.

1081
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:39,542
You understand that?

1082
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,544
I thought
I was gonna lose you.

1083
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,590
Come on, baby.

1084
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,258
Really, Miles.

1085
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,263
I don't ever want to feel
like that again, ever.

1086
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,098
Promise me
I won't ever lose you.

1087
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,934
I promise.

1088
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:59,228
I ain't going nowhere.

1089
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,605
You understand me?

1090
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,195
Give me your hands.

1091
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,452
Heavenly Father,
we come before You.

1092
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:16,287
We thank You, Lord,
for getting us through

1093
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,289
a hard day of work

1094
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:21,334
but most of all
for protecting us.

1095
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:24,170
Lord, we ask
that You would continue

1096
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:27,590
to show Miles that You are
always there with us.

1097
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,969
In Your name we pray.

1098
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:32,220
Amen.

1099
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:35,807
Amen.

1100
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,198
Whoo!
Yeah!

1101
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,408
Happy birthday, baby.

1102
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,201
Smile.
Thank you.

1103
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:56,744
Love it.
But you guys--

1104
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,746
you guys really didn't
have to do this.

1105
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:01,207
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

1106
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,626
Now, Miles, we got you
a little something.

1107
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,045
We hope that
you'll not only use it

1108
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,255
but enjoy it as well.

1109
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,048
Wow.

1110
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,009
I mean, y'all really
don't have to do none of this.

1111
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,427
This is too much for me
right now.

1112
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,012
Go on, Miles.
Open it.

1113
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,930
I know!
Hurry up.

1114
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,181
Okay, okay.

1115
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,809
Let me--
let me open this.

1116
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:22,812
Get out of here.

1117
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,273
You guys got me
my own Bible?

1118
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,025
Look, it's got my name on it
and everything.

1119
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,068
Let me take a picture.
Love it.

1120
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,487
Miles, you need to understand
something.

1121
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,364
We have done
everything we can

1122
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:36,576
to raise all of our children
in the ways of the Lord.

1123
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,369
Now, the Bible says
that we should pray

1124
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:41,581
for our children's spouses
from early in their lives.

1125
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:46,586
Well, we have been praying
for a godly man for Vanessa.

1126
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,422
Miles,
are you that godly man?

1127
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,104
I don't know.

1128
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,372
How come
I can't I figure out

1129
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,707
who you really are?

1130
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,759
Bet she has no idea.

1131
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,482
I see
you're working late again.

1132
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,696
I told you we had
a solid case, right?

1133
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,907
So if they're working late...

1134
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,659
We got to be working late.

1135
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:04,747
If there's something there,

1136
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:05,998
you'll find it.

1137
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,486
This ain't for me.

1138
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,991
Babe,
after church tomorrow,

1139
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,617
you want to go to the movies?

1140
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,119
About tomorrow...

1141
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:44,996
I don't think
I'ma be able to make it.

1142
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,543
What's the matter, babe?

1143
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:52,378
You all right?

1144
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,754
No, Miles,
I'm not all right.

1145
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,007
Look, just tell me
what the problem is.

1146
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,842
There is no problem,
babe.

1147
00:52:57,884 --> 00:52:59,468
I just got some things
I got to take care of tomorrow.

1148
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,928
That's all.

1149
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,597
We all have a lot of stuff
we have to do.

1150
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,432
You're always gonna have
a lot of things you have to do.

1151
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:05,766
Look, I'm gonna put aside
the fact that

1152
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,185
my entire family
is expecting you

1153
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,603
and that, hey,
I'd actually like you

1154
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:09,979
to come to church with me,

1155
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:11,355
and what I'm really
concerned with

1156
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,440
is what the real issue is.

1157
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,482
Why don't you just tell me?

1158
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,775
There's nothing to tell.

1159
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,152
Really?
There's nothing to tell?

1160
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:17,486
Look, I'm not even buying that.

1161
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,280
What is so bad
about going to church?

1162
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,532
God don't want somebody
like me in his church, okay?

1163
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,163
Ridiculous.

1164
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,757
What are you smiling about?

1165
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,718
Look, babe, I'm not trying
to belittle your feelings.

1166
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,470
Look, I'm sorry,

1167
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,639
but you're just so off.

1168
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,767
Like, so off.

1169
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:51,187
And to be honest,
I'm a little relieved

1170
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:52,605
'cause I thought
you were actually

1171
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:53,814
keeping something from me...

1172
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,858
something ugly.

1173
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,278
Well, don't be getting
all happy just yet.

1174
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,781
I haven't told you
why I feel this way.

1175
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,783
It doesn't matter.

1176
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,577
God doesn't care about
what you've done in your past

1177
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,246
or what you're in the middle of
right now.

1178
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,624
He just wants you
to come as you are.

1179
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,209
You sure about that?

1180
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,169
I'm positive.

1181
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:16,963
Look, the Bible says,

1182
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,174
"What causes a man
to gain the whole world

1183
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:23,594
and lose his soul."

1184
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:27,765
Baby, I don't want you
to lose your soul.

1185
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:31,978
Once you really get to know
God and His Word,

1186
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:35,022
you'll see that that book
is better than life,

1187
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:38,818
better than the cars,
better than the money.

1188
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,195
For a man like you,
even better than--

1189
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:42,530
Better than what?

1190
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,823
Look, please,
better than sex.

1191
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,449
Yes, I said it.

1192
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:48,119
Yeah, this must be
a great book, 'cause...

1193
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,328
Hey, watch what you saying.

1194
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,705
Ain't too many things--

1195
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,164
Hey, we're talking about God.

1196
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,582

1231
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,164
Hey, Miles, good to see you.

1232
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:16,999
Good to see you too,
Mr. Leon.

1233
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,334
How you doing, Mrs. Leon?

1234
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,585

Here.

1267
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:00,686
How much are you giving?

1268
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:02,104
I don't know.
About that much.

1269
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,314
That's not enough?

1270
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:06,192
Babe, that's plenty.

1271
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,402

All right, I'll see you
in a little bit.

1278
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,588
Amanda, what's up, baby?

1279
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,964
Pastor Galley,
how are you today?

1280
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,341
I'm wonderful.
How are you?

1281
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,800
Fantastic.
It was an awesome worship.

1282
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,135
I loved it.
I had a great time, too.

1283
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:34,512
The Spirit was really moving,
right?

1284
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,013
Oh, it was in me.
It was everywhere.

1285
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:37,640
I'll see you on Thursday
at rehearsal.

1286
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,225
Don't be late.
Yes, I'll see you there.

1287
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,602
All right, Ma.
See you.

1288
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:42,603
Hey, Pastor Galley.

1289
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,021
Vanessa, how are you, Ma?

1290
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:45,814
Pastor Galley,
this is my boyfriend, Miles.

1291
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,233
Miles, Pastor Galley.

1292
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,235
Miles, you got some church in
today, huh?

1293
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,819
Yeah, it wasn't
what I was expecting,

1294
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,196
but it was good.

1295
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:53,697
That's right.
That's right.

1296
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,199
So you really,
like, a pastor, huh?

1297
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:56,867
I mean, like a real pastor.

1298
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,953
As opposed to, like,
an imaginary, cartoon pastor?

1299
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,956
Nah, that's not
what I meant, man.

1300
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,707
I mean, you don't really look
like a pastor.

1301
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:04,708
I don't, huh?

1302
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,126
So what's a real pastor

1303
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,795
supposed to look like,
Miles?

1304
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:10,756
I don't know, man.
I mean, look at you, man.

1305
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,591
Clothes,
your jewelry...

1306
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:15,886
You're kind of tight to death
yourself there, Miles.

1307
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:19,306
Yeah, but I don't drive
no Lambo, Pastor.

1308
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:20,599
The Lambo, huh?

1309
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:22,434
I recall pulling into
the parking lot

1310
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,228
and passing
a four-door black Bentley

1311
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,688
that I've never seen here
before,

1312
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,731
and I'm assuming that's yours,
man.

1313
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,733
Yeah, but I ain't no pastor.

1314
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,944
True that, but the last time
I read the Bible,

1315
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:35,739
it said nothing
about style being a sin.

1316
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,533
Kind of goes back
to that old saying

1317
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,035
that you cannot judge a book
by its cover, you heard?

1318
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,121
Yeah, I dig.

1319
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,040
So what made you
want to be a pastor anyway?

1320
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,459
Well, God had a calling
on my life, Miles,

1321
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,878
and as much as I tried
to avoid that call,

1322
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,463
I couldn't avoid it anymore,

1323
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,923
and here I am.

1324
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:54,717
He's got a calling
on your life, too.

1325
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:55,968
On everybody's life.

1326
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,177
But you got to answer
the phone

1327
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,971
when He calls, you dig?

1328
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,306
A calling, huh?

1329
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,099
A calling.
I tell you what.

1330
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,726
We'll talk more about that
in the future.

1331
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,060
I'd love to see you around here
a little bit more.

1332
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,312
All right.

1333
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,688
You have a blessed Sunday,
Vanessa.

1334
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,939
Such good worship today,
by the way.

1335
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,149
Praise God.
Miles...

1336
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,317
Pastor.
It was a pleasure.

1337
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,527
Pleasure's all mine.

1338
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,404
Hope you two
brought your appetites,

1339
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,740
because your mother cooks enough
for an army.

1340
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,075
It looks good too, Ma.

1341
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,369
So you got Miles
to go to church?

1342
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,330
Mm-hmm.
Just this Sunday.

1343
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,290
I cannot believe this.

1344
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:28,500
Vanessa,
you are an angel from heaven.

1345
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,044
You just don't know

1346
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,837
how hard I've been praying
for this boy.

1347
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:33,881
Whoo, you and I both.

1348
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,382
Mm-hmm.

1349
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,385
Okay, let's say grace.

1350
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:41,055
Dear Lord,
thank You for the food

1351
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,765
we are about to receive

1352
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,351
for the nourishment
and health of our bodies,

1353
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,645
for our wonderful son, Miles,

1354
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,814
and for bringing the beautiful
Vanessa into our lives.

1355
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,859
She is truly
an angel from heaven.

1356
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,736
In Jesus' name we pray.

1357
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:59,365
Amen.

1358
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:01,075
Now, Vanessa, honey,

1359
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,868
don't you be afraid
to crack the whip on this--

1360
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,329
If he gives you any trouble,

1361
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:06,622
you just let us know.

1362
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,040
We'll straighten him out.

1363
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,542
All right,
I like the sound of that.

1364
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,628
Let's eat.

1365
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:42,866
Man, what took you so long?

1366
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,410
Sorry, big dog.

1367
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,078
Sorry?
Let me tell you something, man.

1368
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,955
Don't ever have me waiting
like that ever again.

1369
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,957
You hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.

1370
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:51,750
Man, here.

1371
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:57,923
125k, man, nice and neat,
just like you like it.

1372
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,174
All right, here, man.

1373
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,801
Get out of here.
Get out of my car.

1374
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,428
All right.

1375
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,096
See you soon, Martin.
Yeah, whatever.

1376
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:07,141
Got you.

1377
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,310
Babe, I got a question.

1378
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,563
What's up?

1379
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,440
Have you considered,
you know,

1380
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,692
taking that walk of faith
during the altar call?

1381
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:20,654
Babe,
I ain't gonna lie to you.

1382
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:22,364
What?

1383
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,324
I'm still trying to figure
this whole thing out.

1384
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,034
I mean,
I know there's a God,

1385
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,537
and I'm supposed to act
a certain way and everything,

1386
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:31,373
but to be real, babe,

1387
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:34,209
I'm still researching
this whole salvation thing.

1388
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,878
I mean, I just don't want
to dive into it.

1389
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,254
Does that make
any sense to you?

1390
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:39,256
Yes, it makes perfect sense,
babe.

1391
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:40,466
I get it.

1392
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,675
I will say this, though.

1393
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:43,135
What will you say?

1394
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:44,553
I feel real good
when I'm in church.

1395
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,096
Yeah?
Yeah.

1396
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:48,098
I mean, it feels like
everything's moving

1397
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,601
in the right direction,
you know?

1398
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,269
But then I get to thinking,

1399
01:02:52,311 --> 01:02:55,731
if God is this all loving,

1400
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,942
all seeing, all being God,

1401
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,736
then why does He allow
things to happen

1402
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:03,363
like rape, murder,

1403
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,823
war?

1404
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,617
Like, that part
I don't understand, babe.

1405
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,246
I see you clearly have been
giving this a lot of thought.

1406
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,750
Well, yeah, I mean,
just the other night,

1407
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,045
I'm sitting in bed,
and I'm watching this program,

1408
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:20,255
and this Muslim speaker's
speaking,

1409
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,883
and he's talking about
the book that they read,

1410
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,134
the Koran.

1411
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:25,594
Okay.

1412
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,012
He's basically saying that,

1413
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:28,806
you know, they believe
that Jesus existed

1414
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,600
but that he was only
a prophet,

1415
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:34,228
and then he started getting into
all these scientific facts

1416
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:37,105
that exist in the Koran

1417
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,651
that, you know,
scientists didn't even discover.

1418
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,069
I thought it was--

1419
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,363
I thought it was
really, really interesting.

1420
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,615
All right, well,
how did it make you feel?

1421
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,620
To be honest?

1422
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:52,913
I don't know,

1423
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,667
it's a lot to swallow, babe.

1424
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,338
All right, well,

1425
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,798
whenever you're ready.

1426
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:06,844
Whenever you're ready.

1427
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,637
Hopefully sooner
rather than later.

1428
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,560
Merry Christmas, everybody.

1429
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,894
Merry Christmas.

1430
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:18,230
What a special time of year
this is.

1431
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:20,440
To think that God
would become flesh

1432
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,859
and dwell among us,

1433
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,485
that ought to fill our hearts
with joy.

1434
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,906
Vanessa, honey, it was so nice
meeting your family.

1435
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:30,158
Thank you.
You're all so beautiful.

1436
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,786
And with such pretty daughters
as you three,

1437
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:35,163
it's no wonder your father
turned to the Lord.

1438
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,333
Man must spend
a lot of time on his knees.

1439
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,002
Amen.

1440
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,337
Look, Mom, Dad,
me and V

1441
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,923
want to give y'all
a little something.

1442
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,341
We know y'all been trying
to, you know,

1443
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,593
get away
for quite some time,

1444
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,553
so we got y'all something

1445
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:50,971
we think y'all might like.

1446
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:54,266
Wait a minute, son,
what is this?

1447
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:55,684
Open it up.

1448
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,352
Okay.

1449
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:01,273
Sandals Resorts.

1450
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,317
Look at this place.

1451
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:05,861
Oh, my gosh, it's the one
we saw in the commercial.

1452
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:08,030
Thank you.

1453
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,656
Look at this, honey.

1454
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,658
Son, this is beautiful,
but you shouldn't have.

1455
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,118
Aw, come on, Pop.

1456
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,870
You and Mom been trying
to get away for years,

1457
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:16,622
so this is our gift to you.

1458
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,290
Baby, I love it,

1459
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:22,836
and I'm so glad to finally
get to go to Sandals.

1460
01:05:22,878 --> 01:05:25,380
Sandals, here we come.

1461
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,965
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1462
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:28,216
Oh, merry Christmas.

1463
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:12,010
Listen to this.

1464
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:15,222
"How much more pleasing
is your love than wine,

1465
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,600
"sweetness as the honeycomb,
my bride.

1466
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,435
"Milk and honey
under your tongue.

1467
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,105
"Your two breasts
are like two fawns.

1468
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,524
"I slept,
but my heart was awake.

1469
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,151
"Listen, my love is knocking.

1470
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,861
"My head is drenched
with dew.

1471
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,279
"I've taken off my robe.

1472
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,573
"Must I put it on again?

1473
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:37,828
My lover thrusts his hand
through the latch opening."

1474
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,955
Now, that sounds like
late-night HBO to me.

1475
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:41,456
Hold up.

1476
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,583
If you could hear
how you just read that...

1477
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:44,710
I read it how it's reading.

1478
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:46,044
That's what it is.

1479
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:47,754
Babe, okay,
are you trying to say

1480
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:50,632
that the Bible says
that it's okay to have sex?

1481
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:54,261
Babe, I don't know what
the Bible is saying.

1482
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,179
I guess I'm just trying
to figure this all out.

1483
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,806
That's all.

1484
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:59,766
Babe,
I can almost assure you

1485
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,768
that these people
that they're talking about

1486
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,186
are married.

1487
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,563
Now, the Bible says you can

1488
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,982
totally enjoy
your spouse sexually.

1489
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:09,484
Now, how did you interpret it?

1490
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,236
You know what?

1491
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,196
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Just forget about it.

1492
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,656
No, no.
That's a good thing.

1493
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,241
It's good that
we discuss these things.

1494
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:17,743
Just forget it.

1495
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,453
It's important to discuss
the Word of God.

1496
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:20,454
Drop it.

1497
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:21,580
Really?
Really?

1498
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,136
Y'all in trouble now.

1499
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,387
Uncle Freddie.

1500
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,435
Miles, my man, man.

1501
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:44,895
Marty, what's up?
What's up, baby?

1502
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,271
Where you been at, man?

1503
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:47,856
Ain't seen you around
in a minute.

1504
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,399
Just been rippin'
and runnin', baby.

1505
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:51,109
You know,
rippin' and runnin'.

1506
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:53,862
Hey, you all right, Miles?

1507
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,113
Don't I look all right?

1508
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:56,698
I mean, not really,

1509
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,033
but if you say so.

1510
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,534
Hey, where's Vanessa at?

1511
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,578
Man, I don't know.

1512
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,121
She's around somewhere.

1513
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:05,290
She just ain't here with me,
you know?

1514
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:06,625
So what,
you ready to party

1515
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,044
with your boys tonight,
then, or what?

1516
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,337
You know what?

1517
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,338
Let's do that, man.

1518
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:12,881
Drinks are on me tonight, man.

1519
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:14,341
I ain't been with y'all
in a minute.

1520
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,717
Let's do what we do.
Let's do it.

1521
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,011
Keep them coming all night,
beautiful.

1522
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:19,262
Okay, I'll be back.

1523
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,098
Baby, thank you.

1524
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:22,933
Hey, yo, Miles,
what's going on with you, man?

1525
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,102
For real?
With what?

1526
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,311
With what?

1527
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,312
With you, homey.

1528
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:28,605
I mean, we don't ever

1529
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:29,689
see you around no more, dog,

1530
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:31,691
and when we do,

1531
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,068
it's never without Vanessa.

1532
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,778
You say that to say what?

1533
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,615
Look, dog,
I'm just saying, man.

1534
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:41,034
You ain't nowhere near
your normal self,

1535
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:42,702
and to be honest with you,
man,

1536
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,663
me and the fellas is just
concerned about you, man.

1537
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,039
That's all.

1538
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:47,499
Look, I just need
a little vacation.

1539
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:48,917
That's all.
I'm good.

1540
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,919
Look, dog,
me and you go back, man.

1541
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:54,172
We go back further than
all these cats right here,

1542
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:56,216
and if there's one thing
I know about you,

1543
01:08:56,258 --> 01:09:00,011
the only thing that can get you
off your square is a girl,

1544
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,597
so if you need
to talk about it,

1545
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:05,058
for real, I'm right here
like I always been, man.

1546
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,395
I'm all ears,
but if not,

1547
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,522
then that's cool too, man,
'cause I got something else

1548
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,232
that can get your mind off that,
you feel me?

1549
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:13,358

1574
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:36,483
I got to go-

1575
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,034
Why, Miles?
Why?

1576
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:50,455
God help me.

1577
01:10:57,337 --> 01:10:59,005
God help me.

1578
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:15,021
Miles, it's your mama.

1579
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:16,356
She's very ill.

1580
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:18,024
Hurry up and get down here.

1581
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:19,442
No. No.

1582
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:21,278
"But if any of you
lacks wisdom,

1583
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,779
let him ask of God"--

1584
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:25,073
I'm so sorry guys.
It's Miles' dad.

1585
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,577
Hello?

1586
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,579
Vanessa, it's Caesar.

1587
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,540
Hi, Mr. Montego, how are you?

1588
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:34,833
Not good.

1589
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,001
It's Miles' mom.

1590
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,252
She's very ill.

1591
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:40,547
Thank God you're here, son.

1592
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:43,925
Hey, Pop, how you doing?

1593
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:47,178
I came as soon as I could,
Ma.

1594
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,888
How you doing?

1595
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,099
Hi, baby.

1596
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,184
I'm sorry.

1597
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,395
I ruined the trip.
Trip?

1598
01:11:55,437 --> 01:11:57,605
What you talking about,
"trip"?

1599
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:01,026
Don't worry about that,
okay?

1600
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,903
You just concentrate
on getting well.

1601
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,655
How you feeling?

1602
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,994
She's under a lot
of medication right now.

1603
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:14,331
Let's let her rest.

1604
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,750
Don't worry, son.

1605
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,126
It'll be all right.

1606
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,340
Okay.

1607
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,719
Miles,
I need to talk to you.

1608
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,597
Come on.

1609
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:36,019
Well, son,

1610
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:37,771
it's not good.

1611
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:39,022
Not good at all.

1612
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,235
How?

1613
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,071
How does somebody go
from perfectly healthy

1614
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:48,615
to dying overnight?

1615
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,825
It wasn't overnight.

1616
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,536
Apparently, your mother
lived with this for years,

1617
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:56,623
and you know your mother
and doctors.

1618
01:12:56,664 --> 01:13:00,210
There's no way to know.

1619
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:01,628
Your mother always thought

1620
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:04,506
that an aspirin
could fix everything.

1621
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,387
So what do we do now?

1622
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,805
They said the best thing to do

1623
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:15,517
is to try to help her
feel comfortable.

1624
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:18,061
But, Miles,

1625
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:22,440
right now, I need you
to be strong for your mama,

1626
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,984
okay?

1627
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,487
Yeah, Pop.

1628
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:28,738
Good.

1629
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,583
Miles, I'm so sorry.

1630
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,504
I can't even imagine

1631
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:46,172
what you're going through
right now.

1632
01:13:52,387 --> 01:13:55,140
Look,

1633
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,600
V, I want to explain
something to you.

1634
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,644
Miles, you don't
have to explain anything.

1635
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,312
I know this is not
the right time.

1636
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:04,315
It's not the right time.
Just listen to me.

1637
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,484
I don't know
what's going on right now,

1638
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:09,446
but I've never felt
like this.

1639
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,947
It's like--

1640
01:14:10,989 --> 01:14:13,658
it's like I'm feeling guilt

1641
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,160
and shame.

1642
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:21,791
It's like--I don't know--
I don't deserve anything.

1643
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,251
All at the same time.

1644
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,424
Then I get confused

1645
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:32,719
about what I think
God is telling me.

1646
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,221
I never feel like
I'm doing the right thing, babe.

1647
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,727
I want you to understand
something.

1648
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,272
Look at me.

1649
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:48,526
I want you to know that
nothing happened that night.

1650
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,741
Miles, you don't have to--

1651
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:55,992
Hey, babe, just--

1652
01:14:57,869 --> 01:15:01,247
I love you.

1653
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:04,959
I love you,

1654
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,920
and I would never do anything
to hurt you.

1655
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,719
Is that the whole truth,
Miles?

1656
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,181
No question, babe.

1657
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,644
I believe you, baby.

1658
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:32,737
Vanessa.

1659
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:35,365
I need you
to do something for me.

1660
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:36,783
Anything you ask me to,

1661
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,826
I'll do it.

1662
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,161
Don't cry.

1663
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:42,163
Just listen.

1664
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,252
I need you to take care
of Miles for me.

1665
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:52,382
I know there's a reason

1666
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:55,593
why you two met.

1667
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:58,596
God has something special
for you two.

1668
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,350
God knew

1669
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:04,978
that the only way to his heart--

1670
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:10,358
Was through a woman like you--

1671
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:15,363
beautiful, wonderful,

1672
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:16,948
godly woman.

1673
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:21,786
Please don't ever

1674
01:16:21,828 --> 01:16:25,206
give up on him

1675
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:27,792
if you really love him.

1676
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,589
I do.

1677
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,048
I really do.

1678
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:45,602
Baby.

1679
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:50,773
Now, I want a big wedding

1680
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,652
and lots of grandbabies,
okay?

1681
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,280
Ma, don't do this right now.

1682
01:16:57,322 --> 01:16:59,282
You're gonna be fine.

1683
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:02,619
No, Miles, I'm not,

1684
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,412
so I need you

1685
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:06,581
to keep seeking the Lord.

1686
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:09,834
He's the answer

1687
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:12,920
to all your problems.

1688
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,549
He's got big plans for you,
baby.

1689
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,179
Big plans.

1690
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:29,604
My love.

1691
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:37,654
She's really tired right now.

1692
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:40,865
Let her get some rest.

1693
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,700
It's been a long day.

1694
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,551
Ma.

1695
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,636
Ma!

1696
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,225
Ma.

1697
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,239
May the Lord
now welcome Julia

1698
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,242
to the table of God's children
in heaven.

1699
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:26,577
With faith and hope
in eternal life,

1700
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:30,081
let us assist her
with our prayers.

1701
01:18:30,123 --> 01:18:33,334
Eternal rest
grant unto her, O Lord.

1702
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:37,547
May her soul and the souls of
all the faithful departed,

1703
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,966
through the mercy of God,

1704
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,634
rest in peace.

1705
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:42,927
Amen.

1706
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:53,104
Looks like a nice party.

1707
01:18:53,146 --> 01:18:56,357
Have a little respect
for the dead, Brian.

1708
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,610
You want to send
some flowers?

1709
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,654
I just don't see the point
in keeping an eye on him

1710
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:02,864
while he's here.

1711
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,699
I don't buy this.

1712
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:07,702
You don't get to be
where a guy like that is

1713
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:10,037
and just flip it off.

1714
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,082
This guy's smarter
than the average crook.

1715
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:16,294
This could all
be a smoke screen.

1716
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:19,297
Maybe.

1717
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:21,883
You believe in God,
Brian?

1718
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,719
Oh, don't go getting
all religified on me, Jason.

1719
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:28,097
Do you go to church?

1720
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:29,348
Yes, sir.

1721
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,516
Every week,

1722
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:32,310
wife and kids,
Bible study,

1723
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,854
the whole nine yards.

1724
01:19:34,896 --> 01:19:37,023
You do, huh?

1725
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:38,566
Why didn't I know that?

1726
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,486
You never asked.

1727
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,373
Miles?

1728
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:55,708
I just wanted to tell you

1729
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,585
that I am so sorry
for your loss.

1730
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:05,134
Your mother
was a beautiful woman.

1731
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:06,928
I saw the look on her face

1732
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:08,221
and felt the warmth of her heart

1733
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,724
when she saw you in church.

1734
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,810
I'm sorry
if I haven't always been

1735
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:17,063
the easiest person
when it comes to you.

1736
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:20,608
I want you to know
I'm always praying for you.

1737
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:26,113
Remember, you may
not always understand

1738
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,033
why God does certain things,

1739
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:30,868
but I can promise you

1740
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,788
that it's all part
of one big plan for your life.

1741
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:40,044
Just know that
this family loves you.

1742
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:51,055
Thank you.

1743
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:52,515
That means a lot to me.

1744
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:06,946
Hey, Mrs. Leon.

1745
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:08,865
Hi, Miles.

1746
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:12,702
I hope you have an open heart
and mind about this.

1747
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,204
I really love your daughter.

1748
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:16,622
I mean, she means
the world to me.

1749
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:22,712
I want to spend
the rest of my life with her.

1750
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:35,099
I want to marry her.

1751
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:38,060
I mean, with your permission,
of course.

1752
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,687
It'd be an honor

1753
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:43,691
to have you as part
of this family, Miles.

1754
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:46,736
Do you think you're
truly ready for this, Miles?

1755
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,988
Well, I know I got a long way
to go, Mrs. Leon...

1756
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:54,201
...but no one's gonna
love or treat Vanessa

1757
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:56,412
the way I can,

1758
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:59,624
so, yeah,

1759
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,042
I'm ready.

1760
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:35,868
Uh-oh.
Okay, okay.

1761
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,870
Loving it.
Look at you.

1762
01:22:37,912 --> 01:22:39,455
Thank you, baby.

1763
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:41,290
So you ready for your big
birthday surprise?

1764
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:42,792
Yes, but seriously,
you're crazy.

1765
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,251
Come on, we could have
done something

1766
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,545
super simple like dinner.

1767
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:47,546
It ain't too late.

1768
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,131
We could always cancel.

1769
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,342
You know,
Jimmy's is open 24 hours.

1770
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:52,718
That's what we won't be doing.

1771
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,970
Come on, let's go.

1772
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:05,064
Where are we?

1773
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:07,692
You know this is crazy,
right?

1774
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,610
Who does this?

1775
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,404
Okay, babe,
is there steps or--

1776
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,447
Come here. Come here.
Okay. Okay.

1777
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:14,532
I'm--hey.

1778
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:15,616
Right here.

1779
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:16,867
It's windy.

1780
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:21,664
Happy birthday, baby.

1781
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:28,170
Oh, my gosh.
Are you crazy?

1782
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:29,922
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1783
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:31,507
Oh, my--
is this for real?

1784
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:35,761
Hi, how can I help you, sir?

1785
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:37,221
I'd like to see
the flight plan

1786
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:39,056
of that last private jet
that went out, please.

1787
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:40,141
I'm sorry, sir.

1788
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,434
That information
is confidential.

1789
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:42,685
It's okay.

1790
01:23:42,727 --> 01:23:43,811
I'm Mr. Confidential.

1791
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:52,987
Look, babe.

1792
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:54,613
Look out this window.

1793
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,786
Know what I see?

1794
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:03,664
What?

1795
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:05,166
I see God, baby.

1796
01:24:07,168 --> 01:24:09,170
You do?

1797
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,130
I mean, only He could have
created all this.

1798
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:16,552
I look, and I see a world
with no limits.

1799
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:22,975
With the right drive
and hustle,

1800
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,519
anybody could have anything
and everything they want.

1801
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:32,943
It's been a rough
couple of months for me,

1802
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,987
but I learned a lot.

1803
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:36,280
Yeah?

1804
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:37,740
Like what?

1805
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,494
Well, I learned

1806
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,537
I'm not as in control of things

1807
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,957
as I thought I was.

1808
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,710
I learned that life

1809
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:51,629
can be taken away from you
just like that.

1810
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:57,676
I learned that God is...

1811
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:59,929
really and truly
in control of all of this.

1812
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:07,770
But the most important
thing I learned...

1813
01:25:07,812 --> 01:25:09,021
What?

1814
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:18,114
Is that I never
want to be alone.

1815
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:20,407
I never want to be
away from you again, baby.

1816
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:43,139
Vanessa Leon,

1817
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,640
will you marry me?

1818
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:51,772
Miles,

1819
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,566
ain't no question.

1820
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:03,909
Freeze!
Freeze!

1821
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,911
Show me your hands!
Don't move!

1822
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:07,413
Put your hands
behind your back!

1823
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:15,713
Get him!
Hold it!

1824
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,131
Hold it right there!
Freeze!

1825
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:20,384
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

1826
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:22,845
I got him!
I Got him!

1827
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:24,305
Freeze!
Freeze!

1828
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:25,431

I told you not to--
Shut up!

1839
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,373
Shut up!

1840
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:52,791
We in this position here.

1841
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,210
We got to wait for Miles
to get us out,

1842
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:55,211
and that's it.

1843
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:57,671
We here.

1844
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:02,968
Yo.

1845
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,137
Hey, yo, Miles, man, listen,
don't say nothing, okay?

1846
01:27:05,179 --> 01:27:06,430
Just listen.

1847
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:07,556
We got hemmed up, dog.

1848
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:09,141
Me, Percy, Chris, Wikki--

1849
01:27:09,183 --> 01:27:10,309
all of us, man.

1850
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:11,602
We locked up right now.

1851
01:27:11,644 --> 01:27:13,187
You got to be kidding me.

1852
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:14,855
Man, does is sound like
I'm kidding, dog?

1853
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:15,981
Listen, and to top it off,

1854
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:17,358
it's the feds that got us.

1855
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:18,359
The feds?

1856
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,860
Yeah, man.

1857
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:22,154
They set our bail
at $112 million right now.

1858
01:27:22,196 --> 01:27:23,906
All right,
what you want me to do, man?

1859
01:27:23,948 --> 01:27:27,159
Look, dog, I need you to
get us out of here right now.

1860
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:28,577
All right, I'm on it.

1861
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:40,214
So what happened?

1862
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:41,715
Man, they came at us hard,
Miles.

1863
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,259
I mean real hard--

1864
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:46,262
feds all over the place,
SWAT cars, guns.

1865
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:48,597
They took us all down
in different places, man.

1866
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:49,890
It was not good.

1867
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:51,225
They charge you
with something?

1868
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:52,977
What's the charges?

1869
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:55,104
Man, the indictment had
all kinds of stuff in it, man.

1870
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,647
Still trying
to figure it all out.

1871
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:58,440
What about the spots?
I mean, was anybody dirty?

1872
01:27:58,482 --> 01:27:59,775
Did they find anything?

1873
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:01,151
Nah, man,
but I'll tell you this--

1874
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:02,778
they tore my spot up
real good,

1875
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:04,655
and thank God the only thing
they found was a gun.

1876
01:28:04,697 --> 01:28:05,948
Mine too, man.

1877
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,866
They left that joint
a mess, dude.

1878
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,785
Yeah, man, them dudes bust
the door down, dog.

1879
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:12,496
They act like they was looking
for bin Laden or something, man.

1880
01:28:12,538 --> 01:28:13,664
Man, check this out, man.

1881
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:15,332
They got some of my people,

1882
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:17,042
but I got my lawyer on it.

1883
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:18,794
Says he won't know nothing
for a few days

1884
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:20,212
till he gets the reports back,

1885
01:28:20,254 --> 01:28:23,299
but they was pressing us
really hard, Miles.

1886
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,592
Pressing?
About what?

1887
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,720
About you.
About me?

1888
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:29,471
Man, look, this guy told me
I could get up

1889
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:30,931
and leave right then and there

1890
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,558
if I told them
something juicy about you.

1891
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:33,934
Yep.

1892
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:35,185
Told me the same thing.

1893
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,563
This Agent McDaniel dude?

1894
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,565
He got it real bad
for you, Miles.

1895
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:41,608
Yeah, that's real talk,
Miles.

1896
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,903
Man, they offered to take me
right back to my house, man,

1897
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:46,989
and forget like any of this
even happened.

1898
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:48,741
What'd you say?

1899
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,869
Man, I asked them if I could
get ESPN in my cell, man.

1900
01:28:57,875 --> 01:28:59,251
Yeah, what about you?

1901
01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:04,548
You really got to ask me that,
Miles?

1902
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,425
After everything
we've been through?

1903
01:29:06,467 --> 01:29:08,177
I think they was just
fishing for something

1904
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:09,762
and trying to use
me and all the fellas

1905
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:12,306
as bait to get at you.

1906
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:14,350
I'm buggin'.

1907
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:17,019
My bad.

1908
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,981
Just stay out of their way
till we can figure this out.

1909
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:21,982
I feel you.

1910
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:23,400
Man, done.

1911
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:25,444
Thanks a lot, man.

1912
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:26,695
Thank y'all, man.

1913
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:33,327
Hustle it up, man.
Come on.

1914
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:42,961
So not one of these guys
gave us anything on Miles.

1915
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:45,964
Not one, sir.

1916
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,549
I'm surprised.

1917
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:51,345
I thought that little guy Chris
would have talked.

1918
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:52,930
Maybe there's nothing
to tell, Chief.

1919
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:55,557
What are you saying?

1920
01:29:55,599 --> 01:30:00,771
That Miles is some
squeaky-clean choirboy now?

1921
01:30:00,813 --> 01:30:02,022
Maybe.

1922
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:06,985
Just get this guy.

1923
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:15,661
Let's move out.

1924
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,416
Man, Pastor, I'm sorry.

1925
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:21,959
She's usually on time
for everything.

1926
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,669
Hey, don't worry about it,
Miles.

1927
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,213
Listen, we spend half our days
waiting on the Lord

1928
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:29,007
and the other half
waiting on our wives.

1929
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:31,009
Hey, don't tell her
I said that to you, though.

1930
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:32,010
I won't.
I won't.

1931
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:39,560
Excuse me, Pastor.
I got to take this.

1932
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:40,853
Hello?

1933
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,187
Miles.

1934
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:43,522
It's Alyssa.

1935
01:30:43,564 --> 01:30:45,357
Hey, Alyssa, what's up?

1936
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:47,609
Vanessa's been
in a car accident.

1937
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,321
What happened?

1938
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:54,283
Her car was hit by a truck
that ran a red light.

1939
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:55,409
How is she?

1940
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:56,785
She's not well, Miles.

1941
01:30:56,827 --> 01:30:58,287
She's still in surgery.

1942
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:05,794
Mr. And Mrs. Leon?

1943
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:12,885
Well, here's where we're at,
folks.

1944
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:14,386
She has internal bleeding,

1945
01:31:14,428 --> 01:31:16,430
suffered severe head trauma--

1946
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:20,017
she's in a coma.

1947
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:21,685
Is she gonna be all right,
doc?

1948
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:23,312
I mean, she gonna live,
right?

1949
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:24,563
Only time will tell.

1950
01:31:24,605 --> 01:31:25,981
We've done all we can for her.

1951
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:27,608
We just need to see
how her body reacts

1952
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:30,110
to the procedures
and hope for the best.

1953
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:31,820
Hope?

1954
01:31:31,862 --> 01:31:33,655
Hope?

1955
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,658
You say hope,
and they say pray.

1956
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,119
I mean, can we all get on
the same page here at least?

1957
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:40,829
Take it easy, son.

1958
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:42,873
Take it easy?

1959
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:44,625
You said you've done
all you can for her, doc.

1960
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,084
Yes, we have.

1961
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,211
You sure about that?

1962
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,630
Miles, please, calm down.

1963
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,548
It's in the Lord's hands now.

1964
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,342
"It's in the Lord's hands."

1965
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:56,220
I'm tired of hearing
it's in the Lord's hands.

1966
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:57,554
I heard that
when my mother died.

1967
01:31:57,596 --> 01:32:00,224
"It's in the Lord's hands."

1968
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,017
Look, I'm sorry,
but somebody else

1969
01:32:02,059 --> 01:32:04,436
needs to step in
and take the wheel here,

1970
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:07,439
'cause it seems like
He is out to lunch.

1971
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:09,149
Look, I promise you

1972
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,984
I'll do everything I can
to save her life.

1973
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:12,236
You have my word.

1974
01:32:21,954 --> 01:32:23,497
Look,

1975
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:25,123
I'm sorry.

1976
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:27,292
There's somebody
I got to go talk to.

1977
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:29,127
Miles, wait.

1978
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,262
Good.

1979
01:32:38,303 --> 01:32:40,222
I'm glad You're here,

1980
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:44,351
'cause we got some serious
issues to talk about.

1981
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:46,937
First of all,
You took my mother from me,

1982
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:48,355
and that just about killed me,

1983
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:52,317
but I kept my mouth shut
and let that one slide.

1984
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:56,196
I've done some bad things
to people for a lot less,

1985
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:00,325
but I've been trying to give You
the benefit of the doubt.

1986
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:02,869
I've been faithful.

1987
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,162
I been going to church,

1988
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:06,748
reading your
precious little book.

1989
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,959
I even drop stacks of hundreds
every Sunday

1990
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:13,380
in that little velvet bag
they pass around.

1991
01:33:13,422 --> 01:33:15,591
I've changed.

1992
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:16,758
I'm a changed man,

1993
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,635
can't you see that?

1994
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:23,307
Oh, my bad.

1995
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:24,391
Of course You can.

1996
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:26,518
You see everything, right?

1997
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,730
So what's the problem, then?

1998
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:33,233
What do You want from me?

1999
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:35,611
I know I haven't made You proud.

2000
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:39,573
How could I with
all this mess I got going on?

2001
01:33:39,615 --> 01:33:42,576
What happened?

2002
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:45,203
What happened to all the things
I've been reading about?

2003
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:49,333
Grace, forgiveness, mercy?

2004
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:51,209
Where was the mercy
for my mother?

2005
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,844
Now You want to take Vanessa
from me?

2006
01:34:00,886 --> 01:34:06,266
Nah, that ain't gonna happen,
big guy.

2007
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:09,269
Look, I'm a stand-up guy.

2008
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:11,146
If anybody needs to pay
for they sins,

2009
01:34:11,188 --> 01:34:12,648
then let it be me.

2010
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:14,858
Please just leave
everybody else out of it.

2011
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:18,111
Just take me!

2012
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:20,113
I'm ready
for whatever You got coming.

2013
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:22,115
You want to send me to hell,

2014
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:23,617
book the flight!

2015
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:28,121
But please.

2016
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:30,540
Please.

2017
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,250
I'm begging You.

2018
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,756
Don't take Vanessa from me.

2019
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:44,304
Just tell me.

2020
01:34:44,346 --> 01:34:46,723
Look,
whatever You want me to do.

2021
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:48,016
Tell me what You want me to do

2022
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:50,894
to spare her life.

2023
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:54,856
I didn't mean a word
I just said, Lord.

2024
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:56,942
I'm sorry for yelling at You
in Your house.

2025
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:02,030
But, God, You got to know
this is rough on me.

2026
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:05,659
Just let me know
what I got to do

2027
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:08,662
to make this right.

2028
01:35:08,704 --> 01:35:10,205
I'll do it.

2029
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,710
I surrender, Lord.

2030
01:35:17,796 --> 01:35:19,631
I surrender.

2031
01:35:49,703 --> 01:35:51,037
Okay, Miles,

2032
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,581
get out of the car.

2033
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,917
Get out of the car.

2034
01:35:55,959 --> 01:35:58,170
Put your hands in the air

2035
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:01,631
right now.

2036
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,008
Is there a problem,
officers?

2037
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,468
Turn around!

2038
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:06,636
Turn around!

2039
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:08,096
Walk backwards.

2040
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:17,606
Put your hands on your head.

2041
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,691
Down to your knees.

2042
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:29,326
House is clear.

2043
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,744
House is clear.
House is clear.

2044
01:36:48,929 --> 01:36:51,807
All right, Miles.

2045
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:53,642
Now, let's just see
what you're made of.

2046
01:36:59,606 --> 01:37:01,775
Mr. Montego,

2047
01:37:01,817 --> 01:37:05,445
my name's Agent Carey,
and this is Agent Stokes.

2048
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:08,031
We're with the IRS C.I.D.

2049
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:09,658
You know what that means?

2050
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,368
No,

2051
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,745
but I'm sure
you're about to tell me.

2052
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:16,998
IRS criminal investigation
division.

2053
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,458
All right, yeah, and?

2054
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,085
And, well, Mr. Montego,

2055
01:37:20,126 --> 01:37:22,295
that means that we have
a series of questions for you,

2056
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:26,174
and we would appreciate your
full cooperation with them.

2057
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:28,677
Do you know these guys,
Miles?

2058
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,053
Yeah, they're friends of mine.

2059
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:32,222
How good of friends?
Old friends.

2060
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:33,765
We went to school
and grew up together.

2061
01:37:33,807 --> 01:37:35,058
Why?

2062
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,185
Is that all you did
together, Miles?

2063
01:37:37,227 --> 01:37:39,020
What's that supposed to mean?

2064
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:42,732
It means that they've been
indicted on drug charges.

2065
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,526
It means that we found
these check stubs

2066
01:37:44,568 --> 01:37:47,320
that show large payments
made from your company

2067
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,155
to each of these
individuals.

2068
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,867
It means that this

2069
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:54,703
looks like you're in business
with these guys,

2070
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:56,830
and if you are,

2071
01:37:56,872 --> 01:37:58,498
you're in a deep mess.

2072
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:01,501
First of all,
I'm a legitimate businessman.

2073
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:05,922
Man, I don't have any illegal
dealings of any kind.

2074
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,676
All right,
so I wrote them some checks.

2075
01:38:09,718 --> 01:38:12,220
Last time I checked,
gentlemen,

2076
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:14,055
that's still legal
in this country.

2077
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:16,057
Well, that depends on why

2078
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:18,685
the checks were issued
in the first place.

2079
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:21,271
I'm a concert promoter.

2080
01:38:21,313 --> 01:38:23,398
They invested
in a few shows of mine.

2081
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,483
Do you know your friends'
source of income?

2082
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:27,569
No, and I don't really care.

2083
01:38:27,611 --> 01:38:29,195
Well, I hate
to tell you this, Miles,

2084
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:32,240
but their problems are quickly
becoming your problems.

2085
01:38:32,282 --> 01:38:33,491
Oh! yeah?

2086
01:38:33,533 --> 01:38:35,243
What kind of problems
are those?

2087
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:36,912
It's a problem

2088
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:39,706
when you use
illegally gotten funds

2089
01:38:39,748 --> 01:38:42,876
to fund even a legit business.

2090
01:38:42,918 --> 01:38:44,669
That makes all
of its gains and assets

2091
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:47,505
up for grabs to us.

2092
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:50,884
Make me believe you, Miles.

2093
01:38:50,926 --> 01:38:52,761
I really want to believe you.

2094
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:55,931
Look, does it look like
I'm trying to hide anything

2095
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:58,183
from you or anybody else?

2096
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,893
Miles, we're giving you
a chance here

2097
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:03,605
to save yourself a long
and dirty investigation

2098
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:05,523
that, in the end,
can only hurt you.

2099
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:08,902
Fellas, if y'all
want to go down this road,

2100
01:39:08,944 --> 01:39:10,904
let's do it.

2101
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:14,407
I got a CPA that handles
all my financial affairs.

2102
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,201
I'm sure,
together with my lawyer,

2103
01:39:16,242 --> 01:39:19,788
they can answer any questions
that y'all might have.

2104
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:25,627
So if y'all gonna charge
and arrest me with something,

2105
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:28,254
I suggest you go ahead
and do it

2106
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,549
so I can bail out
and go on with my day,

2107
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:34,761
but if not,

2108
01:39:34,803 --> 01:39:37,389
I'd appreciate it
if you showed me the door.

2109
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:44,229
You have any luck with him?

2110
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,564
Nothing.

2111
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:50,318
Looks like it's bad guys: 3.
Good guys: 0.

2112
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:53,947
Why don't I give it
just one last shot?

2113
01:39:53,989 --> 01:39:55,198
All right.

2114
01:39:59,828 --> 01:40:02,205
Okay, everybody out.

2115
01:40:02,247 --> 01:40:03,873
Let's go!
Out!

2116
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:14,300
Real smooth, aren't you?

2117
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:16,511
You got those guys wondering.

2118
01:40:16,553 --> 01:40:20,974
But I think
you're as dirty as sin.

2119
01:40:21,016 --> 01:40:22,934
Yeah, sin.

2120
01:40:22,976 --> 01:40:24,561
Isn't that what you talk about

2121
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:26,187
in those sweet little
church meetings of yours?

2122
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:27,439
Whatever, man.

2123
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:29,065
I'm not a churchgoing man,

2124
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:32,986
but I take guys like you
very seriously.

2125
01:40:33,028 --> 01:40:36,614
So let me give you
the raw and uncut version.

2126
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:39,075
I'm gonna walk out of here.

2127
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:40,326
I'm gonna give you
a few minutes

2128
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:43,163
to gather your thoughts.

2129
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:46,499
Then I'm gonna come back,

2130
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:50,879
and it's gonna be time
for confession.

2131
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,297
Hey.

2132
01:40:52,338 --> 01:40:55,759
You know confession.

2133
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:06,936
I think he's clean, Chief.

2134
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:08,313
Who knows?

2135
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:11,024
He just might be
that choirboy after all.

2136
01:41:11,066 --> 01:41:13,485
We probably
should just let him go.

2137
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:04,369
I'm gonna say a prayer.

2138
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:11,251
Don't laugh at me, okay?

2139
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:13,628
You know I'm new to this.

2140
01:42:23,263 --> 01:42:24,931
Dear God...

2141
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:30,478
what can I say?

2142
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:34,065
I give up.

2143
01:42:34,107 --> 01:42:39,362
I finally figured out
that You are who You say You are

2144
01:42:39,404 --> 01:42:41,739
and I can't do nothing
without You.

2145
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:48,204
I know that You run
this whole thing

2146
01:42:48,246 --> 01:42:50,915
and that everything I have
really belongs to You...

2147
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:57,589
including Vanessa,
even my mom.

2148
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:59,132
I'm humbly asking You--

2149
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:01,676
no, I'm begging You, God,

2150
01:43:01,718 --> 01:43:03,970
please,

2151
01:43:04,012 --> 01:43:07,515
please spare her life.

2152
01:43:07,557 --> 01:43:09,309
Please allow her
to come out of this coma

2153
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:13,313
and be healthy again.

2154
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:14,772
I'm here to do or say

2155
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:17,483
whatever You want me
to say or do, God.

2156
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:26,242
I know I don't have much
to offer.

2157
01:43:26,284 --> 01:43:30,413
But what I do have is Yours...

2158
01:43:30,455 --> 01:43:34,500
including my heart.

2159
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,920
I want You in my life.

2160
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:41,549
I want You in my heart, Lord.

2161
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:45,261
I promise--

2162
01:43:45,303 --> 01:43:46,888
I promise to be
as faithful to You

2163
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:48,223
as I possibly can.

2164
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:54,687
I love You,

2165
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:57,315
and I pray all these things

2166
01:43:57,357 --> 01:43:59,525
in Your name,

2167
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:02,946
Christ Jesus.

2168
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,280

V?

2190
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:50,011
You awake?

2191
01:45:50,053 --> 01:45:52,221
Hey, guys, she's awake!

2192
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:53,848
Come here!
Everybody come in!

2193
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:55,683
V.

2194
01:46:07,195 --> 01:46:08,404
Good morning, church.

2195
01:46:08,446 --> 01:46:09,697
Good morning.

2196
01:46:09,739 --> 01:46:11,032
Listen,
if you have your Bibles,

2197
01:46:11,074 --> 01:46:12,033
say, "Got it."

2198
01:46:12,075 --> 01:46:13,034
Got it.

2199
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:15,328
Good.
James 1.

2200
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:16,662
This is what the Bible says:

2201
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,414
"Consider it pure joy

2202
01:46:18,456 --> 01:46:21,417
"whenever you face trials
of many kinds,

2203
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:23,544
"knowing that
the trying of your faith,

2204
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:24,962
"the testing of your faith

2205
01:46:25,004 --> 01:46:27,340
develops perseverance
in your life."

2206
01:46:27,382 --> 01:46:29,092
And we should allow
perseverance

2207
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:31,094
to have her work in our life,

2208
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:36,265
because God uses that
to complete us and to mature us.

2209
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:38,267
And I'm looking at a family here
this morning

2210
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:42,814
who went through
a severe trial,

2211
01:46:42,855 --> 01:46:45,316
a beast of a trial,
the Leon family.

2212
01:46:45,358 --> 01:46:46,526
And you know, church,

2213
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:48,611
remember,
we all prayed for them,

2214
01:46:48,653 --> 01:46:51,447
and we asked God
to do a miracle,

2215
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:53,574
and God did answer our prayers,

2216
01:46:53,616 --> 01:46:56,077
and Vanessa woke up
from her coma,

2217
01:46:56,119 --> 01:46:58,579
and I tell you,
I just want to thank God.

2218
01:46:58,621 --> 01:46:59,914
To God be the glory.
Amen.

2219
01:47:04,961 --> 01:47:06,045
Yes.

2220
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:07,422
Hallelujah.

2221
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:09,382
To God be the glory.

2222
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:11,259
Now,
finally the Bible says this,

2223
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,887
that today is the day
of salvation,

2224
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:18,516
that now
is the acceptable time

2225
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:20,560
to receive
the Lord Jesus Christ

2226
01:47:20,601 --> 01:47:22,311
as our savior.

2227
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:23,813
And I'm just going to open up--

2228
01:47:23,855 --> 01:47:25,481
I'd just like you to all
stand with me,

2229
01:47:25,523 --> 01:47:26,983
and I really sense

2230
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,609
that there may be someone
here today

2231
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:31,612
that would like to come forward
and kneel before us

2232
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:34,073
and say, "Yes,
I'm going to open my life up

2233
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:35,533
"to the Lord Jesus Christ.

2234
01:47:35,575 --> 01:47:38,619
I'm confessing Jesus
as my Lord today."

2235
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:41,330
Anyone want to come,
kneel before us

2236
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:43,416
and open their life
before the Lord?

2237
01:47:46,127 --> 01:47:48,629
Excuse me, Pop.

2238
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:51,466
Where are you going?

2239
01:47:51,507 --> 01:47:53,342
I'll be right back.

2240
01:47:53,384 --> 01:47:55,678

I need to keep.

are in the best

2257
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:46,687
and I hope y'all
are staying out of trouble,

2258
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:48,731
'cause I know how y'all like
to wild out.

2259
01:48:48,773 --> 01:48:50,233
Ah, man, I can't tell you

2260
01:48:50,274 --> 01:48:51,943
how much I miss y'all.

2261
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:55,112
I can't imagine how hard it is
in there.

2262
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:56,197
And as for me,

2263
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:58,199
man, what could I say?

2264
01:48:58,241 --> 01:49:02,161
I guess God
has a sense of humor, right?

2265
01:49:02,203 --> 01:49:03,329
Vanessa's doing great.

2266
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:05,498
She sends her love.

2267
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,083
Man!

2268
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:08,167
So much has happened

2269
01:49:08,209 --> 01:49:10,211
over these last couple of years.

2270
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:12,004
It's been crazy
but all to the good, though,

2271
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:13,506
you know?

2272
01:49:13,548 --> 01:49:16,175
It's a new season, man.

2273
01:49:16,217 --> 01:49:17,843
I finally turned in
my player card

2274
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:20,263
and wifed Vanessa.

2275
01:49:25,977 --> 01:49:28,813
Yeah, I took the plunge.

2276
01:49:30,106 --> 01:49:32,608
In more ways than one.

2277
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:34,026
God has been so good to me.

2278
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:37,780
Sometimes I can't even
understand it.

2279
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:40,324
I mean, after all I did
throughout my life,

2280
01:49:40,366 --> 01:49:42,535
and He never gave up on me.

2281
01:49:42,577 --> 01:49:44,161
And if that ain't love,

2282
01:49:44,203 --> 01:49:46,789
I don't know what is.

2283
01:49:46,831 --> 01:49:48,583
I've even been taking
these Bible classes

2284
01:49:48,624 --> 01:49:50,543
just so I can understand
Him and His Word

2285
01:49:50,585 --> 01:49:52,545
a little better.

2286
01:49:52,587 --> 01:49:55,548
Good news is that you guys
are short-timers now.

2287
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:56,757
Just a little ways to go,

2288
01:49:56,799 --> 01:49:59,427
and it's all over, yo.

2289
01:49:59,468 --> 01:50:03,264
Just remember what
we talked about on our visits.

2290
01:50:03,306 --> 01:50:05,224
God is good,
and He is faithful,

2291
01:50:05,266 --> 01:50:08,561
and I promise
that He's inside those walls

2292
01:50:08,603 --> 01:50:12,773
just as much as He is
out here.

2293
01:50:12,815 --> 01:50:15,401
I sent some money
to your books already,

2294
01:50:15,443 --> 01:50:16,861
and it should be enough
to last y'all

2295
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:18,696
until you get out.

2296
01:50:18,738 --> 01:50:21,699
Man, I love y'all, man.

2297
01:50:21,741 --> 01:50:24,160
Can't wait to see you out here
in real clothes.

2298
01:50:28,998 --> 01:50:31,375
Steaks are on me, baby.

2299
01:50:31,417 --> 01:50:35,212
Love, respect, and blessings,

2300
01:50:35,254 --> 01:50:38,215
Miles.

2301
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:40,301
P.S. You guys
are gonna be uncles soon,

2302
01:50:40,343 --> 01:50:42,219
so straighten up,

2303
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:44,764
'cause I don't want my kid
around no knuckleheads, you dig?

2304
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:54,148
Okay, Mama, look,

2305
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:56,359
Daddy's about to preach.

2306
01:50:59,528 --> 01:51:00,696
Good morning.

2307
01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:02,114
Good morning.

2308
01:51:02,156 --> 01:51:05,326
I'm Pastor Miles,

2309
01:51:05,368 --> 01:51:08,412
and today...

2310
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:10,831
today, we're gonna talk
about change.

2311
01:51:37,608 --> 01:51:38,693
It's important to me, man.

2312
01:51:38,734 --> 01:51:40,653
I'm serious.

2313
01:51:40,695 --> 01:51:42,071
We'll deal with Marty,
though--

2314
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:43,698
I mean,
we'll deal with Jesse.

2315
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:44,782
Here's my cash right here.

2316
01:51:44,824 --> 01:51:45,783
T-bone's in.

2317
01:51:45,825 --> 01:51:47,118
I don't mean t--

2318
01:51:50,496 --> 01:51:51,539
No worry.

2319
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:52,665
Can you get out of my light?

2320
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:53,916
I'm joking.

2321
01:51:56,335 --> 01:51:57,795
Sweep the leg.

2322
01:52:06,178 --> 01:52:08,222
Let me get
another round of those.

2323
01:52:08,264 --> 01:52:11,267
Hey, Jesse, let me--
dang it.

2324
01:52:13,519 --> 01:52:15,563
Hello, I'm Miles Montego.

2325
01:52:16,689 --> 01:52:17,690
You are?

2326
01:52:24,739 --> 01:52:26,073
Oh, "Jerry," please,

2327
01:52:26,115 --> 01:52:27,533
and it's my pleasure
to meet you.

2328
01:52:27,575 --> 01:52:29,326
But, uh--
what--

2329
01:52:31,579 --> 01:52:33,289
That's what we won't
be doing.

2330
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:35,291
Oh, I can't dis Jimmy's,
though, right?

2331
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:41,881
I mean, you say hope,
and they say pray.

2332
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,717
I mean, can we get an--

2333
01:52:47,762 --> 01:52:49,263
My bad, y'all.

2334
01:52:49,305 --> 01:52:53,058
Yes, I'd like to see
the flight pa--

2335
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,143
Back to one?

2336
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:59,315
I'm--I'm feeling
bloopers reel here, baby.

2337
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:00,357
All right.

2338
01:53:01,776 --> 01:53:03,027
Oh, hold on.
I got to take this.

2339
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:04,403
Hello?
Okay, good talking to you.

2340
01:53:04,445 --> 01:53:05,654
Yeah.

2343
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,245
