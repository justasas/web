SHE’S THE GIGGLE AT A FUNERAL

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,440

‘WE WERE BORN SICK,

11
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:32,981
' YOU HEARD THEM SAY IT

12
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:35,641
MY CHURCH OFFERS NO ABSOLUTES

13
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:38,587
SHE TELLS ME ‘WORSHIP IN THE BEDROOM’

00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:41,371
THE ONLY HEAVEN I’LL BE SENT TO

15
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:44,208

MY LOVER’S THE SUNLIGHT

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,525
TO KEEP THE GODDESS ON MY SIDE

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,946
SHE DEMANDS A SACRIFICE

35
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:46,711
TO DRAIN THE WHOLE SEA

36
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:47,988
GET SOMETHING SHINY

37
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:51,649
SOMETHING MEATY FOR THE MAIN COURSE

38
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:53,323
