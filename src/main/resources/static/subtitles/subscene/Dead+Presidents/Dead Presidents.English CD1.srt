1
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,031
Oh, man.

2
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,311
Man, what's takin' you so long?
It's cold as a motherfucker out here.

3
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,356
I had to get the last stop.
Quiet, punk.

4
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,432
- I'll shut your hairy ass up, man.
- Come on, man. I'm freezin'
my fuckin' nuts out here!

5
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,351
Mush, motherfucker, mush!

6
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,517
Ant, Juanita gave you
some of that pussy yet?

7
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,757
- Man, get out of here, man.
- What?

8
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,235
Man, I thought we was homies, man.
I'm just askin'.

9
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,313
Well, why you gotta be
askin' me all that? I mean...

10
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,237
I'm just lookin' out for you.

11
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,194
All I'm sayin', man, fine as she is,
she should be giving you something.

12
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,835
I bet you ain't even
smelled the pussy, eh?

13
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,911
You two realize that soon
we're gonna be out of school, right?

14
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,794
- Oh, sure.
- After four long years
of that shit, man.

15
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,957
I can't fuckin' wait to get out. That's
all I've been thinkin' about, man.

16
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,112
You know? I just be thinkin' about like
what am I gonna do afterwards, right?

17
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,431
You know, I can dig some travelling.

18
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,357
Nigger, you sound like
you rich or somethin'.

19
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,597
Hear this nigger?
He ain't even got a fuckin' job.

20
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,514
- I know.
- Man, you better take your ass off
to college, man, I'm tellin' you...

21
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,870
before Uncle Sam grab your ass like
he gonna do this stupid motherfucker.

22
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,434
Oh, bullshit, Skip, man.
Ain't nobody gonna grab me.

23
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,758
Jose, a recruiter
can see your dumb ass a mile away.

24
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,957
Look at you.
You're a recruiter's dream. You a 1-A.

25
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,679
A one-way ticket to motherfuckin'
Vietnam if I ever saw one.

26
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,832
That's why I'm goin' to Hunter College.
You goddam right.

27
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,956
I ain't fightin'
no white man's war. Shit.

28
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,838
Them Vietcongs, chongs, whatever
the fuck, ain't done shit to me.

29
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,753
I don't even know
them motherfuckers, man.

30
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,348
And I ain't afraid of no war.

31
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,471
Man, what the fuck you been smokin'?

32
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,155
Look, y'all might think
I'm crazy, but...

33
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,071
I just wanna do somethin'
that's different.

34
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,948
Yeah, well, gettin' your
fuckin' head blown off is different.

35
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,554
Hey, man, turn that shit down!
And slow this motherfucker down!

36
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,877
- Ain't nobody in a hurry
to go to school.
- Man, leave that shit up.

37
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,236
You know I fucked Monica, right? Her
mama came in, caught us the other day.

38
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,396
Came in, seen my dick,
jumped in the bed too.

39
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,436
- Later on, you chump suckers.
- Ah, fuck you.

40
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,357
- Your mama!
- Punk ass, jivin' around.

41
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,914
- Hey, this is for you,
Anthony, right here.
- Close this motherfuckin' door.

42
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,996
It's cold as hell out here.
Sit your nasty ass down.

43
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,954
Oh, hey. How you doin'?

44
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,150
You up kinda early.

45
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,390
Um, I heard your truck.

46
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,153
Seems like you hear my truck
every mornin'.

47
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,955
Well, uh, morning
is the best time to study, so...

48
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,277
You should, uh, try workin'
on your first boyfriend.

49
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,149
I'm too busy studyin'
to be worryin' about boys.

50
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,475
Your sister up?

51
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,075
Uh, Sleeping Beauty?
Yeah.

52
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,159
Look, uh, tell her I said hey.
See ya.

53
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,478
- Good morning, Anthony.
- Oh, hey.

54
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,997
- I thought you were sleeping.
- You woke me up.

55
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,117
- Uh, so you goin' to school today?
- Mmm.

56
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,117
I could lay in bed all mornin'.

57
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,953
Oh. See, now...
Now that'd be real nice.

58
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,669
- Don't even think about it.
- Well, look, uh...

59
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,035
I'm gonna get on out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

60
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,396
- Okay.
- See ya.

61
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,794
Keep on pushin'

62
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,833
Keep on pushin'

63
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,589
- I'll be down there later on.
- Got to keep on pushin'

64
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,751
I can't stop now

65
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,677
Hard shoe.
Come here, hard shoe.

66
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,711
Come here, man.
What's up? What's up?

67
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,758
Listen, I want you...
I want you to tell Kirby I want 645.

68
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,235
- Straight, now. Listen. And, uh...
- Straight.

69
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,237
- We've been rollin' here.
- Come on, man. I ain't got time.

70
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,151
- Let me get the money.
- I want you to be back here tonight...

71
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,959
- Man, straighten your hat out.
- With my money, you little motherfucker.

72
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,189
- What's goin' on, baby?
- All right, baby.
- All right, cat daddy. All right.

73
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,754
- Hey, Anthony. How you doin'?
- Hey.

74
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,753
You know, you brought me luck the other
day. So look, ten of that's for you.

75
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,509
- See? Now, that's how it goes.
- Hey, now.

76
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,710
- L-I'm gonna use the same number too.
- Don't forget me, man.

77
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,877
What's goin' on?
Hey, what's goin' on?

78
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,673
Hey there, Jellybean.
What's goin' on?

79
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,630
Hey, what's goin' on?
How you been?

80
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,359
Kirby back there?
All right. Cool.

81
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,512
- Go on, get that shot. Get that shot.
- All right, thanks, youngblood.

82
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,029
Hey there, Peanut! What's goin' on?
What's up there? What...

83
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,191
Blood.

84
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,916
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Kirby's back there in the back, man.

85
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,076
Put that in Brooklyn
and get ahold of that fuckin' Spyder.

86
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,192
- Okay, man.
- Hey, brother.

87
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,748
- Aw, man, take them.
- Yeah, yeah.

88
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,389
Here's the numbers and the cash.

89
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,272
- We got five.
- Hubba hubba!

90
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,750
Ain't you supposed to be
duck huntin' with your daddy?

91
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,519
Oh, yeah.
We gonna go next weekend.

92
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,350
- Aw, shit!
- Oh, man, Kirby.

93
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,153
Made me miss my shot.

94
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,077
You know these motherfuckers down South.

95
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,431
I wonder if half the time
they believe what they be sayin'.

96
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,391
What's a nigger gonna do?

97
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,275
We got blood in this land
from slaves.

98
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,318
Been to war. Spilt our blood.
Shit, I been to war. I spilt blood.

99
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,396
Ha! That's right.
Tell 'em, Kirby.

100
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,590
You over there fightin' in Korea.

101
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,116
That's how I got this plastic-ass leg.
Nicky, fix me a drink.

102
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,634
Ko-motherfuckin'-rea.

103
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,516
Damn! Mmm!

104
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,676
Never gonna give you up

105
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,035
That's why I had to leave that
motherfucker, because if I'd have...

106
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,634
If I'd have still been down there,
I'd have killed me a motherfucker.

107
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,474
Man, shit ain't gonna change.
What make you think shit gonna change?

108
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,034
Nigger, what's your little
narrow ass doin' up in here, man?

109
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,793
Leave that boy alone
and let him shoot.

110
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,078
Aw, Kirby, man, you know he too
goddam young to be up in here, man.

111
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,668
He can outshoot you.

112
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,716
Oh, shit.

113
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,354
Oh, I know you out
your motherfuckin' mind, man.

114
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,789
Put your money
where your mouth is.

115
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,995
I take your money.
Rack 'em, boy.

116
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,593
- Uh, huh, huh, huh
- Watch this.

117
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,314
I got the feelin'

118
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,590
Baby, baby, I got the feelin'

119
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,315
- Yes!
- You don't know

120
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,635
You got my two dollars?

121
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,950
Game ain't over yet, man.

122
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,275
Got the eight ball,
corner pocket.

123
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,353
Oh, man!

124
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,676
Don't run out of here without payin' me
after that boy whup you.

125
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,916
Yeah, at least I will
run out of this, motherfucker.

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,468
People that owe me money don't pay me,
I take care of 'em.

127
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,037
Man, will you get the fuck off
my motherfuckin' table, please?

128
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,878
- Baby-baby-baby, baby-baby-baby
- Chicken-haired motherfucker.

129
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,952
Ain't no goddam business
bein' here in the first place.

130
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,956
Ooh, missed it by that much.

131
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,998
- Cleanup time.
- You don't never play with me.

132
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,395
Eight ball, corner pocket.

133
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,913
Oh! Yes! Game.

134
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,516
Hey, that's a good game, Cowboy.

135
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,676
You're a lucky motherfucker,
you know that?

136
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,552
Aw, I wouldn't say luck,
but, you know.

137
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,353
- Just know how to play a little bit.
- Here's the money.

138
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,268
- Give that to Kirby.
- All right.

139
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,153
Uh, wait, wait.
This is two dollars.

140
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,558
See, uh, you bet me, so that means,
uh, you owe me some money too.

141
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,515
Man, fuck you.

142
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,949
Why you gotta cheat?

143
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,913
Man, who the fuck you think
you talkin' to, man?

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,195
You know what? I'm gonna tell
everybody around here...

145
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,790
when it comes to playin' pool,
Cowboy likes to cheat.

146
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,115
Nigger, I'll kick
your little monkey ass, man.

147
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,151
Oh, man.

148
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,674
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth, man.

149
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,631
I oughta cut you.

150
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,759
Little motherfucker. Yeah.

151
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,310
It hurt, don't it?

152
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,119
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doin'?

153
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,318
Get the fuck off of me, man!
Kirby, what the fuck you doin', man?

154
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,550
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- What the fuck are you doin', man?

155
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,519
- Get on out of here!
- You a bad motherfucker!

156
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,795
- And don't you come back in here
unless you come correct.
- Fuck you!

157
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,240
- You all right, kid?
- Oh, yeah.

158
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,749
Just a little cut, you know.
It's all right.

159
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,758
Yep. You do a real good job
for me with them numbers.

160
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,996
Well, you know, I try.

161
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,716
But, uh, you better be cool.
Don't let your mom and pop find out.

162
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,791
Oh, no way.
I won't do that.

163
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,717
It's for you.

164
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,238
Oh, man. Whoa!

165
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,834
- Hey, thanks, Kirby.
- Ain't nothin' to thank me for.

166
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,112
- You earned it.
- Oh. Twenties.

167
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,869
Hey, kid, you wanna take
a little run with me?

168
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,399
Yeah, I'll take
a little run with you.

169
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,109
Say, uh, Kirby, where we goin'?

170
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,634
Like I told you,
just a little run.

171
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,871
A run. Okay. All right.

172
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,917
- Wanna drive, kid?
- Who, me?

173
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,508
No, not "me."
You, motherfucker.

174
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,431
Well, Kirby,
I don't have my licence yet.

175
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,159
Aw, shit. Fuck the dumb shit.
You wanna drive or what?

176
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,708
Yeah. All right, I'll drive.
Yeah.

177
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,155
- Pull over here.
- All right.

178
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,549
Come on. Come on.

179
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,274
What you call her, Nellie?
Come on, Nellie.

180
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,794
I call this bitch
whatever I wanna call her.

181
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,399
Listen here.
Keep that motor runnin'.

182
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,670
- I'll just be a minute here.
- Yeah, all right.

183
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,593
- Stop messin' with my gold!
- Wait a minute!
- How many times I gotta tell you?

184
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,195
I ain't no motherfuckin'
play toy! I'll kick your ass!

185
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,159
- Get the fuck up!
- You get the fuck up off of Spyder!

186
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,033
No.

187
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,196
You got more heart than
your punk-ass old man. Come here.

188
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,713
- Oh, man, Kirby!
- Oh, what the...

189
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,274
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid son-of-a-bitch!

190
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,834
You grabbed the wrong leg,
you stupid cocksucker. Come here!

191
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,633
- Get on back in here now, Spyder.
- You asshole!

192
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,109
- I want my motherfuckin' money, hear?
- Easy, Kirby.

193
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,117
- Now!
- Easy, man!
- Dumb son-of-a...

194
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,515
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid cocksucker.

195
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,871
- I'll fuck you up.
- Get on back down there.

196
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,039
- They gonna call the police.
- I got 15 miles to go now

197
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,948
- Come on. Come on!
- And I can hear my baby callin' my name

198
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,072
Floor this motherfucker.

199
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,997
Floor it.

200
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,109
Now I'll be so glad
to see my baby

201
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,710
And hold her in my arms
one more time

202
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,836
Now when I kiss her lips

203
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,952
- I'll turn a backward flip
- You did good, kid.

204
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,275
You're almost as good
a getaway driver as me.

205
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,756
Uh, thanks. Say, uh...

206
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,195
So you were a getaway driver, huh?

207
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,710
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What? Wh-What's wrong?

208
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,189
- I oughta go back there
and kill that bastard.
- Why? What happened?

209
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,515
Motherfucker made me lose
a whole pack of cigarettes.

210
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,871
A pack of cigarettes?
A pack of cigarettes?

211
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,151
I thought maybe you should be
worried about your leg or somethin'.

212
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,034
- Oh, that shit's funny to you, huh?
- No, no, it's not funny.

213
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,951
I tell you what. The next time
the motherfucker grabs me by...

214
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,271
the wrong leg, I'm gonna use it to kick
his ass between his shoulder blades.

215
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,514
- Hey, man, you really did that sucker.
- Yeah, everybody in town...

216
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,830
know I got one leg, and that
motherfucker grab the wrong one.

217
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,918
Me and Kirby, baby. Yeah.

218
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,629
- This is wonderful news, Edward.
- Thank you.

219
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,469
All right, all right.
You see, Anthony?

220
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,831
You be thankful you can go to City
College on the financial aid programme.

221
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,753
Yeah, in four years,
you can be just like me.

222
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,749
Just like you?

223
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,475
You can graduate and maybe even
go to graduate school too.

224
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,798
Well, I'll tell y'all one thing.
My mama sure would've been proud.

225
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,230
Never would've believed
I got two college graduates.

226
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,755
You think about what
you're gonna major in, baby?

227
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,150
The Marine Corps.
Uh, Dad, could you pass the salt?

228
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,800
What'd you say?

229
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,591
Thanks. I said
the, uh, Marine Corps.

230
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,557
- I'm... I'm joinin'.
- Marine Corps?

231
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,428
- Yeah.
- Now that's original.

232
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,397
What you talkin' about, Anthony?

233
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,512
I'm talkin' about
I wanna do somethin' else.

234
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,876
I don't wanna go to college.

235
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,713
I'm sick of school.

236
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,550
I mean, I don't know why everybody
got this strange look on their face.

237
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,996
- It's my life.
- Yeah.

238
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,917
It's your life.

239
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,352
Looks like to me
you're tryin' to ruin it, baby.

240
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,397
You're an idiot.
You know that?

241
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,712
Dad, I don't wanna go to college.
I'm just not ready for no college.

242
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,832
You always said the marines and fightin'
over in Korea made a man out of you.

243
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,959
I figure I be, you know,
livin' my own life.

244
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,395
I'll talk to your mama.

245
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,956
When your baby and you are tight
and everything is right

246
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,071
- And you is mellow
- Give me that.

247
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,509
There you go.
Now, drink some wine.

248
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,511
You keep everything all right

249
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,279
And you know that
you're the only fellow

250
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,437
Ain't that a groove

251
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,197
Ain't that a groove

252
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,956
Ain't that a groove

253
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,957
Told your little ass
you couldn't drink with me.

254
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,508
- Ain't that a groove
- Hey, James. Want some of this?

255
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,756
- Now, lookee here, fella
- Yeah! Whoo!

256
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,355
Girls like to be in the mood
whenever they think their man is yellow

257
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,472
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Hit me, baby

258
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,356
Say, Skeeter, I still can't
believe you graduated, man.

259
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,438
- Man, shut up.
- Glad we out of school, man.

260
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,909
I'm sick of these
stupid-ass brothers.

261
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,951
I'm about to get
my pimp thing on started.

262
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,514
You know, I got so many ho's now, man,
I gotta get an assistant pimp...

263
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,518
just to keep in track of 'em,
you know, make sure they on
the right streets and shit.

264
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,354
Say, Skippy, why... why you always
talkin' about this pimp stuff, man?
What's happenin'?

265
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,159
'Cause it's real, man. I'm a pimp.
Pimpin' run in my family.

266
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,794
My great-great granddaddy was a slave,
and he was a pimp.

267
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,475
He used to have his ho's
pick his cotton in the field.
He didn't have to do shit.

268
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,915
You better be careful, man. You're
gonna catch something, Skip. Watch.

269
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,918
That's all right, motherfucker.
I was born by the pussy,
I'll die by the pussy.

270
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,831
Don't worry about
what the fuck I do.

271
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,751
Hey, Skip, do you
believe in superstition?

272
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,513
Hell, no.

273
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,151
Well, you should, man.
Your stupid ass jinxed me.

274
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,795
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- Uncle Sam, man.

275
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,872
Dropped a motherfuckin' 1-A on me.

276
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,791
I told you, didn't I?
Didn't I tell you?

277
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,189
- Say, when did that happen?
- Last week, Anthony, man.

278
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,993
Yeah, right, motherfucker.
Pass the joint.

279
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,356
- Anthony, man.
- What?

280
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,750
You know that, um,
that me and Marisol, we tight, man.

281
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,956
Yeah, man, y'all are...
Y'all pretty down.

282
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,156
- You would say I love her?
- I don't know.

283
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,157
I could say that you love her.

284
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,754
- I'm thinkin' about marrying her, man.
- Oh, wait a minute.

285
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,839
- Hey, don't do that shit.
- Hey, man, you might be goin'
a little too fast now.

286
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,357
Hey, I love her, man, and did you see
how she looks today at that party, man?

287
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,552
- She looks good enough to marry.
- I'm glad to hear you want me.

288
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,677
What you over here
talkin' about, Anthony?

289
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,758
- Why you standin' over here?
- Shut up, Skippy.
- Shut up.

290
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,276
Anthony, I know you ain't gonna
stay over here talkin' to Skip
while my song's playin'.

291
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,954
Not if they expect to be
with us tonight.

292
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,831
- Look here, Skippy, we gonna
have to cut on out, bro.
- Uh, yeah.

293
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,155
- Man, where y'all goin'?
- Uh, we gonna go hang on out.

294
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,236
- Look it, have some chicken.
- I thought we was hangin', man.
- Have some chicken, man.

295
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,557
I told you about them broads,
old punk-ass.

296
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,148
And anyway, Skip,
Brenda lookin' for you.

297
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,750
I don't give a fuck.
You tell her I'm at where I at
and I'll be where I be.

298
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,958
Motherfuckin' pimp.
If I gotta go where every ho
want me to be, I be confused.

299
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,116
Motherfucker. Tell her
don't make me hurt my hand again.

300
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,753
If you want a do-right all day

301
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,677
Woman

302
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,999
You gotta be a do-right

303
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,798
All night

304
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,718
Jose, I love you.

305
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,593
I love you too, mama.

306
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,240
If you give my pussy away
to somebody else...

307
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,237
while I'm gone...

308
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,676
I'm gonna come back
and blow that motherfucker up.

309
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,951
I got this itch
I need to be scratched.

310
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,151
S-S-S-So... So you're sayin'
that y-your, your mama...

311
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,071
is workin' a night shift tonight?

312
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,470
Mm-hmm.
And you know what else?

313
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,319
You could scratch it
all night long if you want to.

314
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,196
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.

315
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,669
You swear Big Bertha
won't get off work early?

316
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,758
She's not gonna get off
from work early.

317
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,950
- You scared?
- No, I ain't scared. I just don't...

318
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,548
You act like you're scared.
Come on. Shut up.

319
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,756
- Where Delilah at?
- She in her room. Come on!

320
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,672
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

321
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,677
- Get out.
- Say it loud

322
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,473
- I'm black and I'm proud
- Go to your own room.

323
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,394
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

324
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,879
Once upon a time
I almost lost my mind

325
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,558
I was lonely

326
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,556
So lonely

327
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,399
Once upon a time

328
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,513
Oh, Juanita.

329
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,875
Look, it's okay.

330
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,872
It's all right.
It's okay.

331
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,673
- Okay. Okay.
- Let me get your bra.

332
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,591
- Okay.
- Let me get it.

333
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,750
- Ow. Just unhook it. Just unhook the...
- I can't. I can't.

334
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,838
I'll get it.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

335
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,070
- Okay. Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

336
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,709
Don't peek. Don't look at...
Don't look at me. Okay.

337
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,308
Okay. Okay.

338
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,197
- Oh!
- What?

339
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,552
That's not it.
Up, up, up, up. Higher. Ow.

340
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,114
- That's too high. Wait. Down, down.
- Okay, wait.

341
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,118
- Right there? Okay.
- Yeah.

342
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,471
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

343
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,513
- It's okay.
- Uh-oh. Wait.

344
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,872
Okay. Easy. Ow!

345
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,797
Ah!

346
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,749
Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait.

347
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,429
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

348
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,074
- Okay.
- Baby.

349
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,357
You know, Marisol and Jose
goin' down to city hall tomorrow.

350
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,914
Oh, yeah? What for?

351
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,837
To get married.

352
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,239
- Is that right?
- What you think about that?

353
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,437
Nothin', I guess.

354
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,910
So I guess you don't want me
to wait for you either.

355
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,838
Look, Juanita,
I didn't say that.

356
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,554
So then you're gonna marry me
when you get back?

357
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,794
I mean, if you
ain't got somebody else.

358
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,354
I don't want nobody else.

359
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,473
Juanita, have you
ever thought maybe...

360
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,755
maybe I might get hurt out there
and never come back?

361
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,071
You know, I don't want
you waitin' for nothin'.

362
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,911
You're not scared of losing me?

363
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,317
I didn't say that either.

364
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,237
I'm scared of losing you.

365
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,870
So, do you think we could probably
do it one more time before I go?

366
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,797
Uh-huh.

367
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,312
Oh, no.

368
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,795
- It's Ma!
- Shh! But it's just 6:30!

369
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,469
- She just pulled up.
- Well, go stall her. And close my door!

370
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,516
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Oh, man.

371
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,273
I shouldn't have never messed around
with you in the first place.

372
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,356
- Right.
- You know Bertha gonna kill us.
- Wait a minute.

373
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,391
- Uh-uh. Ain't gonna wait no minute.
Would you move?
- Wait a minute!

374
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,597
Come on. Let me help you
with them packages.

375
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,477
- Delilah!
- I got it.

376
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,875
Girl, you got my good groceries
all on the ground.

377
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,918
Pick those up.

378
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,798
Since I work, the least you girls
could do is keep this place clean.

379
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,390
You know I'm gonna
wait for you, Anthony.

380
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,191
Juanita, I gotta go.

381
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,117
I gotta go, Juanita.

382
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,069
- Nigger, get out of my yard!
- Fuck you!

383
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,677
Shut up!

384
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,791
What's your status? Over.

385
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,595
Shit.

386
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,478
Head for the rally point!
Get back to the rally point!

387
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,591
Get the fuck outta here!

388
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,674
Let's go! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Come on! Come on!

389
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,997
Come on! Move!
Move! Let's go!

390
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,719
Load 'em up! Load 'em up!

391
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,833
Oh, fuck!
I'm out of ammo!

392
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,554
- Devaughn! Cover me!
- Stay down!

393
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,395
I got him! Hurry up!

394
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,433
Don't check out on us, Martin.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

395
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,358
- I got him!
- Cover fire!

396
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,871
Goddam it! They got us pinned down!
We'll never make the rally point!

397
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,195
Dugan!

398
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,795
You think it's time we get these
fucking dinks off our asses? Huh?

399
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,717
- Relax.
- Fuck you!

400
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,037
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

401
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,311
Radio, up!

402
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,914
God don't like dinks.

403
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,039
- How's he doin', Curtis?
- Thanks. Thanks for not leavin' me, man.

404
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,237
- Where the fuck is that radio?
Get that radio up here!
- No, no, no, no, no.

405
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,880
Radio comin'! Radio comin'!

406
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,197
Get that cover fire, Ferguson.
You wanna die, boy?

407
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,236
Sir, sir! Lieutenant!
Arty freak!

408
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,236
Hammerhead, Hammerhead. Recon Cobra.
Emergency fire mission. Over.

409
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,470
Hold on, brother. Come on.
Come on, come on.

410
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,551
You gonna make it, dude.
You only got a little longer.

411
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,319
- You gonna make it.
- Grid five, seven, one-niner.

412
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,955
- Tell my mama...
- No, no, I don't...

413
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,559
Gooks in the bush.
Request firecracker salvo. Will adjust.

414
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,477
How copy? Over.

415
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,433
Roger. Solid copy.
Firecracker shot out.

416
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,028
Incoming!

417
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,993
Down! Down! Down!

418
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,355
Curtis, get down!
Curtis, get down!

419
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,993
Out-fucking-standing job.

420
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,157
Saddle up. Let's get to the rally point,
take that whirlybird home.

421
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,789
- We got some beer to drink.
- We goin' to the rally point now?

422
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,517
The mission's been compromised.
We're goin' to site 37.

423
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,477
It ain't compromised no more.

424
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,472
They're dead.
Now this is Sneaky Pete.

425
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,916
Reconnaissance.
Some of them dead gooks...

426
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,918
they could have important
intelligence papers on their bodies.

427
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,710
All right.

428
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,035
- Move 'em out.
- Move out!

429
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,637
Hammerhead, Hammerhead.
Cobra on site of your mission now.

430
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,236
I count ten... say again, ten...
November-Victor-Alpha-Kilo-lndia-Alpha.

431
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,751
- How copy? Over.
- I copy, one-zero. Good job.

432
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,673
Hammerhead, Cobra. Solid copy.
Good job. Cobra out.

433
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,355
Aw, shit, man! What you doin'?
He already dead.

434
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,474
Motherfucker.

435
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,630
Looks like we nailed us
an officer.

436
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,994
You lucky bastard. You get back to C.P.,
you name your own price, sir.

437
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,079
No way, D'Ambrosio.
I'm keepin' this one.

438
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,549
Been lookin' for one of these
since Cleon and I got here in '66.

439
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,319
Ain't that right, Cleon?

440
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,631
I walked right by that guy.

441
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,228
You gotta keep your eyes open.

442
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,270
Oh, man, what the fuck?

443
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,757
You hungry or somethin', Cleon?

444
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,120
Just like you, sir.

445
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,959
I'm collectin' me a souvenir.

446
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,877
Saddle up. We're movin' out.

447
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,394
That's all he's gonna say? You ain't got
nothin' to tell this fuckin' shit, man?

448
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,957
- Man, that nigger Cleon crazy.
- Yeah.

449
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,877
- Did you see that shit?
- I saw it.

450
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,956
- Nigger, did you see that shit?
- Yes.

451
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,435
I heard that nigger's supposed
to be a preacher's son and shit.

452
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,318
He cuttin' off motherfucker's
heads for souvenirs and shit.

453
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,278
Now, if you hadn't flunked out
of Hunter College, pimp daddy Skippy...

454
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,436
you would've missed all this
good shit down in Vietnam.

455
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,479
Kiss my ass, nigger. You the reason
why I'm at this motherfucker anyway.

456
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,391
You didn't tell me 'bout
this recon shit.

457
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,710
- That's 'cause you didn't ask me
when you were writin' me.
- Nigger, I didn't have to.

458
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,593
- Shit, I figured it was
better than being a grunt.
- It is.

459
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,712
Ant, motherfucker,
we out in the woods all day.

460
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,070
Them motherfuckin' gooks jumpin' out
like Indians every five minutes.

461
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,833
- Man, a nigger
ain't made for this shit.
- You thought this was a skate.

462
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,076
Nigger, ain't nothin'
wrong with no skate.

463
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,714
You could just call me
a skatin' motherfucker.

464
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,513
I skate my ass right out of here,
they give me a chance to.

465
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,035
- Ain't no shitbirds on my squad.
- Man, what you jivin' about?

466
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,635
Hey. Hey.

467
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,389
Ant. To the Bronx.

468
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,317
Yeah, uh...

469
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,591
to the youngblood
who couldn't be with us today.

470
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,553
- Lance Corporal Martin.
- To Lance Corporal Martin.

471
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,829
- Yes.
- Yo, Ant, man.

472
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,837
What they be puttin'
in your head out here, man?

473
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,196
I mean, you done got into this shit
a little bit too deep, don't you think?

474
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,710
You're in recon now, Skip.
You in deep too.

475
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,676
Man, fuck this shit, man.

476
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,876
- Oh, come on, man.
- Man, this ain't our war, man.

477
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,072
Shit, our black ass should be
back in the Bronx where we belong.

478
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,954
Joe-ass got lucky. They sent him
home, gettin' wounded and shit.

479
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,600
Heard he wounded his hand
pretty bad, man.

480
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,518
Shit, that's all right, though.
He got out of this shit.

481
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,712
I rather be home with a fucked-up hand
up in some pussy than to be out here...

482
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,717
healthier than
a motherfucker without it.

483
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,758
- Shit.
- Same old Skip. Boy, you ain't changed.

484
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,677
That's right.

485
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,633
You heard from Juanita?

486
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,796
She used to write me a lot
during my first tour.

487
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,070
We got a package for ya!

488
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,716
Turns out, man, before I left,
fucked around and got her pregnant.

489
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,437
- Man, you bullshittin'.
- No, I ain't.

490
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,552
- No shit?
- Dead serious, man.
Got a little girl back at home.

491
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,758
Oh, man, that's groovy, man. That's
groovy. I can dig it. That's cool.

492
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,711
Hey, dig, man, I know
you got a picture, man.

493
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,230
- Let me see her picture. Shit.
- Can't even look at her, man.

494
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,351
Man, what the fuck
you mean, bro?

495
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,510
That's your little girl, man.
That's your baby.

496
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,995
You know how I survived
26 months in the bush?

497
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,278
Because I don't think about the world,
Skip. That shit don't exist to me.

498
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,516
I don't give a fuck about anything
or anyone in it...

499
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,236
because the minute I do, I'm a dead man
out here, and you remember that shit.

500
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,750
We'll talk about the world
when we get back.

501
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,235
Yeah, whatever, man.

502
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,396
I'm gonna go get high.

503
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,069
I mean real high. And I'm gonna
get my dick sucked too.

504
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,238
Big dick. Big.

505
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,476
Very, very big.
Can you handle it?

506
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,515
"Hey there, Kirby.
What's happenin' back in the world?

507
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,556
If you hadn't heard,
doin' my second tour."

508
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,475
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

509
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,190
"We spend most of our time
livin' in the bush.

510
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,676
Kind of numb to
everything out here.

511
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,069
Tryin' to keep
my head clear.

512
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,277
Our lieutenant is this crazy
white boy named Dugan from Ohio.

513
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,356
He's good at gettin' us
out of crazy situations.

514
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,434
We got this one wild-ass
brother out here named Cleon."

515
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,471
Gook fuck.

516
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,996
"His daddy's this big-time preacher, but
you'd never know from his crazy son."

517
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,676
Now you're good.
Now Jesus loves you.

518
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,997
"He's from Mount Vernon.
Oh, yeah. You won't believe it...

519
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,640
but Skip volunteered
for my unit.

520
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,557
I don't think he's
cut out for recon.

521
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,913
He's always gettin' high and shit,
tryin' to keep his mind off things.

522
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,828
Me, I'm just tryin' to take it one day
at a time and do what's right...

523
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,555
whatever that is.

524
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,074
See you when I get
back to the Bronx.

525
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,997
Anthony."

526
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,751
That fuckin' shit stinks.

527
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,276
I don't wanna pull rank, Cleon, but if
you don't get rid of that fuckin' head...

528
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,396
I don't hear nobody else
complainin' but you.

529
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,075
Well, maybe you should
listen to your team.

530
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,953
Medical advice, Cleon:
You dump that shit.

531
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,992
Hey, Doc, shut the fuck up.
You don't know shit.

532
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,595
Fuck you, man. It stinks like
a sack full of assholes.

533
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,473
Ain't a one of us got as much
as a splinter in his finger...

534
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,511
since I cut this head off.

535
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,029
This head is our
good-luck charm.

536
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,353
Nah, this here's
our good-luck charm.

537
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,517
If you don't mind, Sergeant, l...
My vote is to get rid of it.

538
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,160
Man, Cleon, you need to get the fuck on
with that bullshit, man.

539
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,875
- That head smell like shit.
- Bottom line, Staff Sergeant.

540
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,878
You either get rid of that fuckin' head
A.S.A. fuckin' P., or I'm gonna...

541
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,073
have your ass court-martialed
when we get back to the rear.

542
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,634
We clear?

543
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,038
Cobra, Cobra, Delta six. Over.

544
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,674
Delta six, Delta six, Cobra.
Copy. Over.

545
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,836
Cobra, Delta six.
Execute Charlie, Michael...

546
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,869
We're in a world of shit now.
I just buried our luck.

547
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,595
Listen up. Change of mission.
A patrol from 25 has found...

548
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,036
a shitload of weapons in a vill
about a klik and a half to our whisky.

549
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,957
Platoon commander wants us
to interrogate on the spot.

550
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,833
Betancourt, you're the closest one in
the area that speaks that gook shit.

551
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,112
So that's where we're headin'.
All right, saddle up. We're movin' out.

552
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,796
- So now where's D'Ambrosio?
- He went to go take a shit.

553
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,514
- When?
- When Cleon was diggin' the hole.

554
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,437
- Why the hell didn't you go with him?
- You know how he is.

555
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,677
- He don't like nobody around
when he's shittin'.
- Oh, man.

556
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,995
Grab his shit.
Let's find him.

557
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,277
Aww.

558
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,153
Fuck! Doc.

559
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,192
- 360!
- D'Ambrosio, what'd they do?

560
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,199
You'll be all right.
Doc's gonna take care of you, okay?

561
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,870
This morphine is all
I can do for him right now.

562
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,112
Here, Doc. You can use mine
if that's not enough.

563
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,152
Are you crazy? Another one of those
would kill him right now.

564
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,914
What the fuck
you got there, Curtis?

565
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,788
Somethin' about
"Black men, go home.

566
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,792
This isn't your war."

567
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,151
You get rid of that cocksucking
commie bullshit right now.

568
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,636
- Yeah. Right.
- Hey, Curtis.

569
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,513
- Apply some pressure here.
- We gotta hump this man
back to the rally point.

570
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,437
Oh, shit.

571
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,197
Save me, Curtis.

572
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,311
Look, Adam, you don't
worry 'bout nothin'.

573
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,510
We're a team,
okay, brother?

574
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,398
- We gonna take care of you.
- Please.

575
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,438
Yeah. It's not much longer.
We're almost there.

576
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,477
Kill me.

577
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,557
Kill me!

578
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,549
I would do it
for you.

579
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,875
I would do it
for you, Curtis.

580
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,315
Buttermilk 17.
Cobra, over.

581
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,991
Cobra, Cobra. Buttermilk 17. Inbound
your buzz. Contact on your visual.

582
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,917
- Shh.
- Buttermilk 17. Cobra.

583
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,156
Hey, you gonna be all right.

584
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,477
The medevac will be here
in a minute.

585
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,636
Do it.

586
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,357
You think
I don't mean it?

587
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,358
I can't go home like this.

588
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,591
- Hey, what's he saying?
- He's delirious, man.

589
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,597
- Please.
- Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk.

590
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,389
- Hooking direct to your 12. Stand by.
- Cobra standing by. Over.

591
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,999
Shh-shh-shh.

592
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,429
Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk 17.
Roger your visual. Pop smoke. Over.

593
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,790
Buttermilk 17, Cobra.
Smoke. Over.

594
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,992
Pop the smoke.
Get that man ready for medevac!

595
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,191
- When'd he go?
- A few minutes ago.

596
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,598
It's better to check out
than go home all fucked up.

597
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,757
No shit.

598
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,393
Oh, shit!
Get down!

599
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,120
Fuckin' assholes!

600
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,312
- Stay down! Stay down!
- I'm gonna get these motherfuckers!

601
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,671
Return fire! Fire!

602
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,394
Get these motherfuckers!

603
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,593
- Skip! Return some fire!
- Shoot them motherfuckers!

604
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,077
Mission aborted! We get the fuck
out of Dodge, back to the rally point!

605
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,277
Ferguson! Get some
fuckin' rounds goin'!

606
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,633
Skip! Cover me!

607
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,910
- Dugan!
- Dugan, wait!

608
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,594
Dugan!
Dugan!

609
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,879
Skip! Skip!
Snap out of that shit. Go!

610
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,475
- Fuck this, man.
Let's bug out, Cleon!
- Cobra, move the fuck out!

611
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,670
- Get up! Come on!
- Move it! Move it!

612
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,109
Move! Get up!
Get up! Come on!

613
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,117
- What are you doin'?
- What is this, man?

614
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,232
- Slow down, man.
- Fuckin' grunts!

615
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,278
- Say, get a special shot for Skip.
My man's goin' home today.
- Count of three: 1-2-3.

616
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,675
All right. Good.
Now come on, now. Skip, come on, now.

617
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,069
Let's see a dap, man.

618
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,597
- All right!
- Get one like this. Get one like this.

619
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,631
Come on, now.
Everybody, come on. Get closer.

620
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,069
- Ah, man!
- This is Cobra, baby.

621
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,637
- Recon Cobra!
- It's Cobra. Hey, hey!

622
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,915
Team Cobra, ready?

623
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,077
Come on

624
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,032
Come along, come on
and get up and get down too

625
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,757
- Get down, get up
- Say, h-h-hold on a sec.

626
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,674
- Keep the metre running.
- Get down, get up and move your feet

627
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,554
Come on and rise, rise, rise
Shake your get-up

628
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,910
Straighten up there, marine!

629
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,196
He a friend of yours?

630
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,629
Friend of yours and
I'll give a discount, marine.

631
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,115
No, man.

632
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,233
Oh, shit.

633
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,629
Man, look who's back
in the motherfuckin' world.

634
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,996
Dig this motherfucker
right here, man.

635
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,839
Look at you, man. That's a mackin'
outfit if I've ever seen one.

636
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,390
- Look, with all the stripes and shit.
What, you a captain now?
- No, man.

637
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,314
Look, man, you wear that motherfucker
for about a month, this nigger
get all the pussy, man.

638
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,437
Check this motherfucker out, man.

639
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,030
Well, look, man... Yeah,
you go get me some squares, man.

640
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,635
I gotta take care of a couple things,
baby. I'll get back with you. All right?

641
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,149
You stay up now, all right?

642
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,510
What's happening, blood?

643
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,437
Hey, man, I'm back.

644
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,831
My nigger!

645
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,319
Come on and get down

646
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,476
Hey, Luther!

647
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,318
Tell your sister I'm gonna
be over there later on.

648
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,675
Hey, fuck you!

649
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,075
Man, the neighbourhood is changin'.

650
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,397
Aw, it's still a good place.
White people movin' out, though.

651
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,113
Oh, dig. I saw Juanita
the other day, man.

652
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,078
Man, she finer than a motherfucker.

653
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,873
Is that right?

654
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,191
You need to go check her out, man.
Go see your little daughter.

655
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,959
Remember them big-ass ears
you had when you was young?

656
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,998
She got 'em, just like you.
That's how I know it was yours.

657
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,438
So, what's up with Joe, man?
Is he, uh... Is he workin' or what?

658
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,269
Aw, post office, you know.
Three-quarter gig, part-time.

659
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,119
He gotta do what he gotta do.
He got mouths to feed, you know.

660
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,549
What about you, man?
How you doin'?

661
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,432
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

662
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,994
I'm cool, baby. I'm Skippy, baby.
I'm still pimpin'.

663
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,235
Need any money
or anything, you know?

664
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,788
Man, I got over like a fat rat
when I got out, man.

665
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,316
Dig, I got my school money comin'
from the government once a month.

666
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,954
I got my veteran's cheque
comin' once a month.

667
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,471
I got my fifty percent medical cheque
comin' to me for the rest of my life.

668
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,870
I ain't gotta do a goddam thing else
but go to the mailbox, you dig?

669
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,560
Hey, man, how the hell you pull
a fifty percent medical?

670
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,596
Nigger, you ain't disabled.

671
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,517
Man, some shit got
into me over there, man.

672
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,637
What?

673
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,030
All I know is my blood cells
are all fucked up.

674
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,628
Some nights I wake up
in cold sweats and shit.

675
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,349
Don't look at me like that, man.
It ain't the heroin.

676
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,830
The heroin ain't never did nothin'
to me. A lot of vets
comin' down with this shit.

677
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,918
- And they don't know what it is?
- Square biz.

678
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,791
Damn. Look, man, you wanna
come on in the crib or somethin', man?

679
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,155
Nah, man. I'm cool, baby.
Hey, I'm gonna split.

680
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,999
But you here, baby. You home.
We got plenty of time to do our thing.

681
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,838
You know what I'm sayin'?

682
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,471
- Brother.
- Brother. Go see your mama.

683
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,319
- Right on. I'm gonna check her out.
- With her fine ass.

684
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,391
You know, I been takin' care
of your mama while you been gone.

685
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,311
Boy, I'll kick your head in.
Don't talk like that.

686
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,833
Mmm.

687
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,157
You all right?

688
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,959
Yeah.

689
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,799
Well, can't you look me in my eyes?
I ain't seen you in four years.

690
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,631
Well, what'd you do over there?
What was it like?

691
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,117
Look, uh, I'd rather not
talk about that right now.

692
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,117
Well, Anthony, you gonna have
to tell us something.

693
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,949
Now, you know a lot of them boys
went over there and got hooked
on them drugs and stuff. You know.

694
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,755
Look, I was in a special unit
out there...

695
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,229
and bad habits could've cost us
our lives.

696
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,237
Well, that's what I'm talkin' about,
them bad habits, honey.

697
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,472
Now, if you picked up some of them
things, there's a lot of places
you can go and get help.

698
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,955
No bad habits, Ma.

699
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,508
'Cept a little killin'.

700
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,397
For my country, of course.

701
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,031
Hey. Let me give you some more
of these collards.

702
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,752
- Yeah.
- Baby, this sure is good.

703
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,829
Oh, shit. Look who back.
Look at this motherfuckin' man.

704
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,673
- Hey, what's happenin', youngblood?
- What's goin' on, cool breeze?

705
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,554
- Long time, no see.
- All right now, Pops. What's happenin'?

706
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,872
Hey there. What's goin' on, blood?
Ain't seen you in a long time, man.

707
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,235
- Boy just got back.
- Hey, blood.
- All right.

708
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,750
- Cheers. My man. Drink!
- All right. How you feel? All right.

709
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,473
Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey, I got next game.

710
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,028
- You know that's my table.
- You call that a break?

711
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,317
- I got the thing made
- Hold up there, now. It's my shot.

712
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,750
Say, chump.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

713
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,874
- Ha-ha!
- My man, Joe! What's happenin'?

714
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,236
- Oh, look at you!
- How you doin', man?

715
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,993
- Good, man. What's goin' on, man?
- Jesus Christ, man.

716
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,190
- I can't believe it's you!
You cool, man!
- What's goin' on, man?

717
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,078
Say, man,
I heard you got wounded out there.

718
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,432
Yeah, man. I was in demolitions
and my fuckin' hand gets blown off, man.

719
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,439
- Oh, man. Shit.
- Yeah, man. But hey...

720
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,632
motherfuckers told me everything there
is to know about explosives, man!

721
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,116
- That right?
- Check you out, Pappy.
You got all those kids now.

722
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,158
Man, hey. You gotta check out Kirby,
man. He's over in the back room.

723
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,276
Yeah. Let's go on back.
He's still back here, huh?

724
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,914
- All right. Dig it.
- Hey. Abre la puerta! Hey! Hey!

725
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,309
Doin' all right. You know, Kirby just
all hangin' in there, you know?

726
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,436
- Who the fuck is it?
- It's me.

727
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,636
Blood! What's up, blood?

728
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,358
- Hey, Nicky. What's happenin', man?
- Skin!

729
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,198
Kirby back there, man.

730
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,958
That boy looked at me,
he say, "Kirby...

731
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,789
when she pulled off them drawers,
I thought I'd never stop seein' ass!"

732
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,477
- What's happenin', Captain?
- Who the fuck is that?

733
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,912
- Youngblood?
- Yeah, it's me!

734
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,837
Youngblood! Come on, boy!

735
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,792
- How you doin'? Come on
in the back here, boy. Come on.
- Oh, boy. All right.

736
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,957
Man, I been everywhere
lookin' for a gig.

737
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,356
Aw, motherfuckers forget about you
gettin' your ass almost blown off...

738
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,913
or whatever the fuck.

739
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,635
Yeah. Look, uh, Kirby, uh...

740
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,957
I was thinkin', man.
Maybe, uh, come back and work for you.

741
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,799
What? Work for me?

742
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,668
Yeah. You know. Runnin' numbers.
Like we used to do.

743
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,833
Shh. Fuckin' pigs run me
out of business.

744
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,078
How... How the pigs run you
outta business, man?
You had 'em on the payroll.

745
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,111
Pigs are greedy.

746
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,310
And you gotta remember I'm dealing
with the NYPD...

747
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,914
greediest, most corrupt pigs
on the face of the earth.

748
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,113
So I got the fuck out.

749
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,232
I told that motherfucker I'd rather
eat cat shit with a knittin' needle.

750
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,995
I wasn't gonna bust my ass sendin'
some cop kids to college. Shit.

751
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,795
I dig it.

752
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,269
This place ain't never
made much money.

753
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,870
So I'm just hustlin' here and there.

754
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,190
Tryin' to get over,
just like everybody else.

755
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,396
It's gonna be all right, kid.

756
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,033
Here's to gettin' over.

757
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,510
I hope, man. Hope. Shit.

758
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,356
- You afraid of blood?
- Uh, that's all I been around
for the past three years.

759
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,390
Anthony Curtis.

760
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,631
You related to Tony?
The actor?

761
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,912
N-No. Not...
Oh! The act... No, no, no.

762
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,873
- Different colour, right?
- Yeah! He's a white cat. Yeah.

763
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,470
And his name was Schwartz.
Schwartz, not Curtis.

764
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,313
- Okay.
- Know anything about butchering?

765
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,118
Uh, I'm a fast learner.

766
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,031
Here, put that on.

767
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,476
- Here. Take this.
- Need some help, man!

768
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,511
All right.
