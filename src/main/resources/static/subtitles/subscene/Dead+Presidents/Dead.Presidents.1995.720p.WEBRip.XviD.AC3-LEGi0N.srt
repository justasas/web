1
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,922
Man, what's takin' you so long?
It's cold as a motherfucker out here.

2
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:25,056
I had to get the last stop.
Quiet, punk.

3
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:28,266
- I'll shut your hairy ass up, man.
- Come on, man. I'm freezin' my fuckin' nuts out here!

4
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,269
Mush, motherfucker, mush!

5
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:39,833
Ant, Juanita gave you
some of that pussy yet?

6
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:43,214
- Man, get out of here, man.
- What?

7
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,799
Man, I thought we was homies, man.
I'm just askin'.

8
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:49,011
Well, why you gotta be
askin' me all that? I mean...

9
00:04:49,144 --> 00:04:51,019
I'm just lookin' out for you.

10
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:55,148
All I'm sayin', man, fine as she is,
she should be giving you something.

11
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,948
I bet you ain't even
smelled the pussy, eh?

12
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:01,114
You two realize that soon
we're gonna be out of school, right?

13
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:05,166
- Oh, sure.
- After four long years of that shit, man.

14
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:08,467
I can't fuckin' wait to get out. That's
all I've been thinkin' about, man.

15
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:11,759
You know? I just be thinkin' about like
what am I gonna do afterwards, right?

16
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:15,223
You know, I can dig some travelling.

17
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,233
Nigger, you sound like
you rich or somethin'.

18
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:20,614
Hear this nigger?
He ain't even got a fuckin' job.

19
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,700
- I know.
- Man, you better take your ass off to college, man, I'm tellin' you...

20
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:27,159
before Uncle Sam grab your ass like
he gonna do this stupid motherfucker.

21
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,834
Oh, bullshit, Skip, man.
Ain't nobody gonna grab me.

22
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:34,346
Jose, a recruiter
can see your dumb ass a mile away.

23
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:37,685
Look at you.
You're a recruiter's dream. You a 1-A.

24
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,526
A one-way ticket to motherfuckin'
Vietnam if I ever saw one.

25
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,815
That's why I'm goin' to Hunter College.
You goddam right.

26
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,032
I ain't fightin'
no white man's war. Shit.

27
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:49,040
Them Vietcongs, chongs, whatever
the fuck, ain't done shit to me.

28
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,081
I don't even know
them motherfuckers, man.

29
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:54,790
And I ain't afraid of no war.

30
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:57,005
Man, what the fuck you been smokin'?

31
00:05:57,098 --> 00:06:00,849
Look, y'all might think
I'm crazy, but...

32
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,848
I just wanna do somethin'
that's different.

33
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:06,894
Yeah, well, gettin' your
fuckin' head blown off is different.

34
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,613
Hey, man, turn that shit down!
And slow this motherfucker down!

35
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,081
- Ain't nobody in a hurry
to go to school. - Man, leave that shit up.

36
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:21,803
You know I fucked Monica, right? Her
mama came in, caught us the other day.

37
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:24,057
Came in, seen my dick,
jumped in the bed too.

38
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:26,186
- Later on, you chump suckers.
- Ah, fuck you.

39
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:28,190
- Your mama!
- Punk ass, jivin' around.

40
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,859
- Hey, this is for you,
Anthony, right here. - Close this motherfuckin' door.

41
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,032
It's cold as hell out here.
Sit your nasty ass down.

42
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,509
Oh, hey. How you doin'?

43
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:47,801
You up kinda early.

44
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:50,138
Um, I heard your truck.

45
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:53,022
Seems like you hear my truck
every mornin'.

46
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:56,990
Well, uh, morning
is the best time to study, so...

47
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,455
You should, uh, try workin'
on your first boyfriend.

48
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:04,496
I'm too busy studyin'
to be worryin' about boys.

49
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,011
Your sister up?

50
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,767
Uh, Sleeping Beauty?
Yeah.

51
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:17,030
Look, uh, tell her I said hey.
See ya.

52
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:24,665
- Good morning, Anthony.
- Oh, hey.

53
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:29,382
- I thought you were sleeping.
- You woke me up.

54
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:32,637
- Uh, so you goin' to school today?
- Mmm.

55
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:34,724
I could lay in bed all mornin'.

56
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:37,684
Oh. See, now...
Now that'd be real nice.

57
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:41,562
- Don't even think about it.
- Well, look, uh...

58
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,031
I'm gonna get on out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

59
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:47,538
- Okay.
- See ya.

60
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:53,170
Keep on pushin'

61
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,429
Keep on pushin'

62
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,348
- I'll be down there later on.
- Got to keep on pushin'

63
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,648
I can't stop now

64
00:08:05,782 --> 00:08:07,657
Hard shoe.
Come here, hard shoe.

65
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:09,780
Come here, man.
What's up? What's up?

66
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:12,959
Listen, I want you...
I want you to tell Kirby I want 645.

67
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:15,545
- Straight, now. Listen. And, uh...
- Straight.

68
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:17,634
- We've been rollin' here.
- Come on, man. I ain't got time.

69
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,631
- Let me get the money.
- I want you to be back here tonight...

70
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:22,561
- Man, straighten your hat out.
- With my money, you little motherfucker.

71
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,975
- What's goin' on, baby?
- All right, baby. - All right, cat daddy. All right.

72
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,652
- Hey, Anthony. How you doin'?
- Hey.

73
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,825
You know, you brought me luck the other
day. So look, ten of that's for you.

74
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,745
- See? Now, that's how it goes.
- Hey, now.

75
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,040
- L-I'm gonna use the same number too.
- Don't forget me, man.

76
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:43,345
What's goin' on?
Hey, what's goin' on?

77
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:46,263
Hey there, Jellybean.
What's goin' on?

78
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:01,871
Hey, what's goin' on?
How you been?

79
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:04,719
Kirby back there?
All right. Cool.

80
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,096
- Go on, get that shot. Get that shot.
- All right, thanks, youngblood.

81
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,722
Hey there, Peanut! What's goin' on?
What's up there? What...

82
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:20,196
Blood.

83
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,083
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Kirby's back there in the back, man.

84
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:26,337
Put that in Brooklyn
and get ahold of that fuckin' Spyder.

85
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,588
- Okay, man.
- Hey, brother.

86
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,256
- Aw, man, take them.
- Yeah, yeah.

87
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:36,055
Here's the numbers and the cash.

88
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:42,194
- We got five.
- Hubba hubba!

89
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:45,824
Ain't you supposed to be
duck huntin' with your daddy?

90
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,713
Oh, yeah.
We gonna go next weekend.

91
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:03,145
- Aw, shit!
- Oh, man, Kirby.

92
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:06,071
Made me miss my shot.

93
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:08,078
You know these motherfuckers down South.

94
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,578
I wonder if half the time
they believe what they be sayin'.

95
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,623
What's a nigger gonna do?

96
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:17,676
We got blood in this land
from slaves.

97
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:20,852
Been to war. Spilt our blood.
Shit, I been to war. I spilt blood.

98
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:23,020
Ha! That's right.
Tell 'em, Kirby.

99
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,310
You over there fightin' in Korea.

100
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,989
That's how I got this plastic-ass leg.
Nicky, fix me a drink.

101
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:31,617
Ko-motherfuckin'-rea.

102
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,798
Damn! Mmm!

103
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:41,051
Never gonna give you up

104
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,513
That's why I had to leave that
motherfucker, because if I'd have...

105
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,226
If I'd have still been down there,
I'd have killed me a motherfucker.

106
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:50,233
Man, shit ain't gonna change.
What make you think shit gonna change?

107
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:52,904
Nigger, what's your little
narrow ass doin' up in here, man?

108
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:57,870
Leave that boy alone
and let him shoot.

109
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,342
Aw, Kirby, man, you know he too
goddam young to be up in here, man.

110
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:05,044
He can outshoot you.

111
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,182
Oh, shit.

112
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:09,934
Oh, I know you out
your motherfuckin' mind, man.

113
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:14,563
Put your money
where your mouth is.

114
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,081
I take your money.
Rack 'em, boy.

115
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,966
- Uh, huh, huh, huh
- Watch this.

116
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:31,806
I got the feelin'

117
00:11:31,937 --> 00:11:34,180
Baby, baby, I got the feelin'

118
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:38,068
- Yes!
- You don't know

119
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,489
You got my two dollars?

120
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:42,905
Game ain't over yet, man.

121
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,331
Got the eight ball,
corner pocket.

122
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:49,586
Oh, man!

123
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,184
Don't run out of here without payin' me
after that boy whup you.

124
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:58,521
Yeah, at least I will
run out of this, motherfucker.

125
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:01,185
People that owe me money don't pay me,
I take care of 'em.

126
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:09,083
Man, will you get the fuck off
my motherfuckin' table, please?

127
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:15,178
- Baby-baby-baby, baby-baby-baby
- Chicken-haired motherfucker.

128
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:18,386
Ain't no goddam business
bein' here in the first place.

129
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,739
Ooh, missed it by that much.

130
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:29,913
- Cleanup time.
- You don't never play with me.

131
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,501
Eight ball, corner pocket.

132
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:42,345
Oh! Yes! Game.

133
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:48,192
Hey, that's a good game, Cowboy.

134
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:50,446
You're a lucky motherfucker,
you know that?

135
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:55,535
Aw, I wouldn't say luck,
but, you know.

136
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:58,457
- Just know how to play a little bit.
- Here's the money.

137
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,543
- Give that to Kirby.
- All right.

138
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,554
Uh, wait, wait.
This is two dollars.

139
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:10,150
See, uh, you bet me, so that means,
uh, you owe me some money too.

140
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:15,324
Man, fuck you.

141
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:17,862
Why you gotta cheat?

142
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,955
Man, who the fuck you think
you talkin' to, man?

143
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:23,337
You know what? I'm gonna tell
everybody around here...

144
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:27,089
when it comes to playin' pool,
Cowboy likes to cheat.

145
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,515
Nigger, I'll kick
your little monkey ass, man.

146
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:31,639
Oh, man.

147
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:34,272
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth, man.

148
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,358
I oughta cut you.

149
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:41,665
Little motherfucker. Yeah.

150
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,371
It hurt, don't it?

151
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:48,302
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doin'?

152
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,728
Get the fuck off of me, man!
Kirby, what the fuck you doin', man?

153
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,057
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- What the fuck are you doin', man?

154
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:00,197
- Get on out of here!
- You a bad motherfucker!

155
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:02,572
- And don't you come back in here
unless you come correct. - Fuck you!

156
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,472
- You all right, kid?
- Oh, yeah.

157
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:16,090
Just a little cut, you know.
It's all right.

158
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:22,361
Yep. You do a real good job
for me with them numbers.

159
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,696
Well, you know, I try.

160
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:29,622
But, uh, you better be cool.
Don't let your mom and pop find out.

161
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,787
Oh, no way.
I won't do that.

162
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,057
It's for you.

163
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:45,819
Oh, man. Whoa!

164
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:48,527
- Hey, thanks, Kirby.
- Ain't nothin' to thank me for.

165
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,991
- You earned it.
- Oh. Twenties.

166
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,912
Hey, kid, you wanna take
a little run with me?

167
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,683
Yeah, I'll take
a little run with you.

168
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:09,686
Say, uh, Kirby, where we goin'?

169
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,320
Like I told you,
just a little run.

170
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,698
A run. Okay. All right.

171
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,962
- Wanna drive, kid?
- Who, me?

172
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:23,667
No, not "me."
You, motherfucker.

173
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:25,674
Well, Kirby,
I don't have my licence yet.

174
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:28,520
Aw, shit. Fuck the dumb shit.
You wanna drive or what?

175
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:31,180
Yeah. All right, I'll drive.
Yeah.

176
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,908
- Pull over here.
- All right.

177
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:40,406
Come on. Come on.

178
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,249
What you call her, Nellie?
Come on, Nellie.

179
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:45,879
I call this bitch
whatever I wanna call her.

180
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,163
Listen here.
Keep that motor runnin'.

181
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:04,532
- I'll just be a minute here.
- Yeah, all right.

182
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:33,670
- Stop messin' with my gold!
- Wait a minute! - How many times I gotta tell you?

183
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:42,646
I ain't no motherfuckin'
play toy! I'll kick your ass!

184
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,783
- Get the fuck up!
- You get the fuck up off of Spyder!

185
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:49,782
No.

186
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:52,039
You got more heart than
your punk-ass old man. Come here.

187
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,796
- Oh, man, Kirby!
- Oh, what the...

188
00:16:57,928 --> 00:17:00,469
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid son-of-a-bitch!

189
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,140
You grabbed the wrong leg,
you stupid cocksucker. Come here!

190
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,061
- Get on back in here now, Spyder.
- You asshole!

191
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,645
- I want my motherfuckin' money, hear?
- Easy, Kirby.

192
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:10,740
- Now!
- Easy, man! - Dumb son-of-a...

193
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,243
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid cocksucker.

194
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:16,744
- I'll fuck you up.
- Get on back down there.

195
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:21,093
- They gonna call the police.
- I got 15 miles to go now

196
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:25,172
- Come on. Come on!
- And I can hear my baby callin' my name

197
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,433
Floor this motherfucker.

198
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,442
Floor it.

199
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:36,819
Now I'll be so glad
to see my baby

200
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,577
And hold her in my arms
one more time

201
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,796
Now when I kiss her lips

202
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:46,047
- I'll turn a backward flip
- You did good, kid.

203
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,472
You're almost as good
a getaway driver as me.

204
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:52,103
Uh, thanks. Say, uh...

205
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,648
So you were a getaway driver, huh?

206
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,490
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What? Wh-What's wrong?

207
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:05,077
- I oughta go back there
and kill that bastard. - Why? What happened?

208
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,504
Motherfucker made me lose
a whole pack of cigarettes.

209
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:11,007
A pack of cigarettes?
A pack of cigarettes?

210
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:14,429
I thought maybe you should be
worried about your leg or somethin'.

211
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:18,481
- Oh, that shit's funny to you, huh?
- No, no, it's not funny.

212
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,481
I tell you what. The next time
the motherfucker grabs me by...

213
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:23,946
the wrong leg, I'm gonna use it to kick
his ass between his shoulder blades.

214
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,374
- Hey, man, you really did that sucker.
- Yeah, everybody in town...

215
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,791
know I got one leg, and that
motherfucker grab the wrong one.

216
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:34,012
Me and Kirby, baby. Yeah.

217
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,146
- This is wonderful news, Edward.
- Thank you.

218
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:48,153
All right, all right.
You see, Anthony?

219
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,661
You be thankful you can go to City
College on the financial aid programme.

220
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,797
Yeah, in four years,
you can be just like me.

221
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:00,968
Just like you?

222
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:04,855
You can graduate and maybe even
go to graduate school too.

223
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:09,367
Well, I'll tell y'all one thing.
My mama sure would've been proud.

224
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:12,949
Never would've believed
I got two college graduates.

225
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,713
You think about what
you're gonna major in, baby?

226
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:23,300
The Marine Corps.
Uh, Dad, could you pass the salt?

227
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:26,065
What'd you say?

228
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,108
Thanks. I said
the, uh, Marine Corps.

229
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:34,159
- I'm... I'm joinin'.
- Marine Corps?

230
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:38,199
- Yeah.
- Now that's original.

231
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,253
What you talkin' about, Anthony?

232
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:43,504
I'm talkin' about
I wanna do somethin' else.

233
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:47,014
I don't wanna go to college.

234
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,975
I'm sick of school.

235
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:55,021
I mean, I don't know why everybody
got this strange look on their face.

236
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:58,617
- It's my life.
- Yeah.

237
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,622
It's your life.

238
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:05,251
Looks like to me
you're tryin' to ruin it, baby.

239
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:12,602
You're an idiot.
You know that?

240
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:21,279
Dad, I don't wanna go to college.
I'm just not ready for no college.

241
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:27,666
You always said the marines and fightin'
over in Korea made a man out of you.

242
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:33,014
I figure I be, you know,
livin' my own life.

243
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,644
I'll talk to your mama.

244
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,882
When your baby and you are tight
and everything is right

245
00:20:54,012 --> 00:20:56,089
- And you is mellow
- Give me that.

246
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:58,633
There you go.
Now, drink some wine.

247
00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:00,722
You keep everything all right

248
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:03,611
And you know that
you're the only fellow

249
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:07,950
Ain't that a groove

250
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:11,873
Ain't that a groove

251
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,796
Ain't that a groove

252
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:17,884
Told your little ass
you couldn't drink with me.

253
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,546
- Ain't that a groove
- Hey, James. Want some of this?

254
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:22,891
- Now, lookee here, fella
- Yeah! Whoo!

255
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,647
Girls like to be in the mood
whenever they think their man is yellow

256
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:29,900
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Hit me, baby

257
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:34,996
Say, Skeeter, I still can't
believe you graduated, man.

258
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,213
- Man, shut up.
- Glad we out of school, man.

259
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,791
I'm sick of these
stupid-ass brothers.

260
00:21:40,928 --> 00:21:42,922
I'm about to get
my pimp thing on started.

261
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:45,596
You know, I got so many ho's now, man,
I gotta get an assistant pimp...

262
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:48,731
just to keep in track of 'em,
you know, make sure they on the right streets and shit.

263
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:52,733
Say, Skippy, why... why you always
talkin' about this pimp stuff, man? What's happenin'?

264
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:55,660
'Cause it's real, man. I'm a pimp.
Pimpin' run in my family.

265
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:58,410
My great-great granddaddy was a slave,
and he was a pimp.

266
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,252
He used to have his ho's
pick his cotton in the field. He didn't have to do shit.

267
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,798
You better be careful, man. You're
gonna catch something, Skip. Watch.

268
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,932
That's all right, motherfucker.
I was born by the pussy, I'll die by the pussy.

269
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:09,928
Don't worry about
what the fuck I do.

270
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:11,932
Hey, Skip, do you
believe in superstition?

271
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,813
Hell, no.

272
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:19,653
Well, you should, man.
Your stupid ass jinxed me.

273
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:23,456
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- Uncle Sam, man.

274
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,667
Dropped a motherfuckin' 1-A on me.

275
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,670
I told you, didn't I?
Didn't I tell you?

276
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:31,171
- Say, when did that happen?
- Last week, Anthony, man.

277
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:34,097
Yeah, right, motherfucker.
Pass the joint.

278
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:38,650
- Anthony, man.
- What?

279
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:42,192
You know that, um,
that me and Marisol, we tight, man.

280
00:22:42,286 --> 00:22:44,494
Yeah, man, y'all are...
Y'all pretty down.

281
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,790
- You would say I love her?
- I don't know.

282
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,878
I could say that you love her.

283
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:51,587
- I'm thinkin' about marrying her, man.
- Oh, wait a minute.

284
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:55,850
- Hey, don't do that shit.
- Hey, man, you might be goin' a little too fast now.

285
00:22:55,934 --> 00:23:00,565
Hey, I love her, man, and did you see
how she looks today at that party, man?

286
00:23:00,694 --> 00:23:03,899
- She looks good enough to marry.
- I'm glad to hear you want me.

287
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:09,246
What you over here
talkin' about, Anthony?

288
00:23:09,374 --> 00:23:12,462
- Why you standin' over here?
- Shut up, Skippy. - Shut up.

289
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:19,263
Anthony, I know you ain't gonna
stay over here talkin' to Skip while my song's playin'.

290
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:22,057
Not if they expect to be
with us tonight.

291
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:26,103
- Look here, Skippy, we gonna
have to cut on out, bro. - Uh, yeah.

292
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,529
- Man, where y'all goin'?
- Uh, we gonna go hang on out.

293
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:30,701
- Look it, have some chicken.
- I thought we was hangin', man. - Have some chicken, man.

294
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,165
I told you about them broads,
old punk-ass.

295
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:36,870
And anyway, Skip,
Brenda lookin' for you.

296
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:40,629
I don't give a fuck.
You tell her I'm at where I at and I'll be where I be.

297
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:45,020
Motherfuckin' pimp.
If I gotta go where every ho want me to be, I be confused.

298
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:47,272
Motherfucker. Tell her
don't make me hurt my hand again.

299
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:54,196
If you want a do-right all day

300
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:56,204
Woman

301
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:02,802
You gotta be a do-right

302
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:04,679
All night

303
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:07,726
Jose, I love you.

304
00:24:10,023 --> 00:24:12,813
I love you too, mama.

305
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:15,575
If you give my pussy away
to somebody else...

306
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,659
while I'm gone...

307
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:21,248
I'm gonna come back
and blow that motherfucker up.

308
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,709
I got this itch
I need to be scratched.

309
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,352
S-S-S-So... So you're sayin'
that y-your, your mama...

310
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:38,355
is workin' a night shift tonight?

311
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:41,903
Mm-hmm.
And you know what else?

312
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:44,876
You could scratch it
all night long if you want to.

313
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:52,052
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.

314
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,632
You swear Big Bertha
won't get off work early?

315
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,856
She's not gonna get off
from work early.

316
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:00,143
- You scared?
- No, I ain't scared. I just don't...

317
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,855
You act like you're scared.
Come on. Shut up.

318
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:06,202
- Where Delilah at?
- She in her room. Come on!

319
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,462
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

320
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:16,554
- Get out.
- Say it loud

321
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,472
- I'm black and I'm proud
- Go to your own room.

322
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:23,564
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

323
00:25:28,286 --> 00:25:32,418
Once upon a time
I almost lost my mind

324
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:34,170
I was lonely

325
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:40,429
So lonely

326
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,396
Once upon a time

327
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:47,689
Oh, Juanita.

328
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,153
Look, it's okay.

329
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:53,281
It's all right.
It's okay.

330
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:56,203
- Okay. Okay.
- Let me get your bra.

331
00:25:56,294 --> 00:25:58,205
- Okay.
- Let me get it.

332
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,632
- Ow. Just unhook it. Just unhook the...
- I can't. I can't.

333
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:07,854
I'll get it.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

334
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,183
- Okay. Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

335
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,981
Don't peek. Don't look at...
Don't look at me. Okay.

336
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:16,693
Okay. Okay.

337
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:20,751
- Oh!
- What?

338
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:25,296
That's not it.
Up, up, up, up. Higher. Ow.

339
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:27,969
- That's too high. Wait. Down, down.
- Okay, wait.

340
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,103
- Right there? Okay.
- Yeah.

341
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,602
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

342
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:38,820
- It's okay.
- Uh-oh. Wait.

343
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:43,368
Okay. Easy. Ow!

344
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:45,377
Ah!

345
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:15,589
Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait.

346
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:19,429
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

347
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:22,190
- Okay.
- Baby.

348
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:25,615
You know, Marisol and Jose
goin' down to city hall tomorrow.

349
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,284
Oh, yeah? What for?

350
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,290
To get married.

351
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,884
- Is that right?
- What you think about that?

352
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,264
Nothin', I guess.

353
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:43,933
So I guess you don't want me
to wait for you either.

354
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:46,987
Look, Juanita,
I didn't say that.

355
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:49,822
So then you're gonna marry me
when you get back?

356
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:55,289
I mean, if you
ain't got somebody else.

357
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:00,048
I don't want nobody else.

358
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:05,389
Juanita, have you
ever thought maybe...

359
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,901
maybe I might get hurt out there
and never come back?

360
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,362
You know, I don't want
you waitin' for nothin'.

361
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:19,412
You're not scared of losing me?

362
00:28:20,674 --> 00:28:24,011
I didn't say that either.

363
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:26,013
I'm scared of losing you.

364
00:28:34,198 --> 00:28:39,196
So, do you think we could probably
do it one more time before I go?

365
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,207
Uh-huh.

366
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,484
Oh, no.

367
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:05,206
- It's Ma!
- Shh! But it's just 6:30!

368
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:09,039
- She just pulled up.
- Well, go stall her. And close my door!

369
00:29:09,134 --> 00:29:11,175
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Oh, man.

370
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:14,052
I shouldn't have never messed around
with you in the first place.

371
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,225
- Right.
- You know Bertha gonna kill us. - Wait a minute.

372
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,350
- Uh-uh. Ain't gonna wait no minute.
Would you move? - Wait a minute!

373
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,739
Come on. Let me help you
with them packages.

374
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:25,743
- Delilah!
- I got it.

375
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:28,246
Girl, you got my good groceries
all on the ground.

376
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:31,422
Pick those up.

377
00:29:31,507 --> 00:29:34,427
Since I work, the least you girls
could do is keep this place clean.

378
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:48,610
You know I'm gonna
wait for you, Anthony.

379
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:09,273
Juanita, I gotta go.

380
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,675
I gotta go, Juanita.

381
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:26,885
- Nigger, get out of my yard!
- Fuck you!

382
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,737
Shut up!

383
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:35,986
What's your status? Over.

384
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,391
Shit.

385
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:53,400
Head for the rally point!
Get back to the rally point!

386
00:30:55,614 --> 00:30:57,692
Get the fuck outta here!

387
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,082
Let's go! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Come on! Come on!

388
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:08,549
Come on! Move!
Move! Let's go!

389
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:11,390
Load 'em up! Load 'em up!

390
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:17,770
Oh, fuck!
I'm out of ammo!

391
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,609
- Devaughn! Cover me!
- Stay down!

392
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,618
I got him! Hurry up!

393
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,875
Don't check out on us, Martin.
You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right.

394
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:32,927
- I got him!
- Cover fire!

395
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:37,637
Goddam it! They got us pinned down!
We'll never make the rally point!

396
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:42,149
Dugan!

397
00:31:42,237 --> 00:31:45,905
You think it's time we get these
fucking dinks off our asses? Huh?

398
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:47,911
- Relax.
- Fuck you!

399
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,375
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

400
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:54,791
Radio, up!

401
00:31:54,884 --> 00:31:57,508
God don't like dinks.

402
00:31:57,598 --> 00:32:01,813
- How's he doin', Curtis?
- Thanks. Thanks for not leavin' me, man.

403
00:32:01,897 --> 00:32:05,149
- Where the fuck is that radio?
Get that radio up here! - No, no, no, no, no.

404
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,908
Radio comin'! Radio comin'!

405
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:11,370
Get that cover fire, Ferguson.
You wanna die, boy?

406
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,627
Sir, sir! Lieutenant!
Arty freak!

407
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,845
Hammerhead, Hammerhead. Recon Cobra.
Emergency fire mission. Over.

408
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:25,219
Hold on, brother. Come on.
Come on, come on.

409
00:32:25,313 --> 00:32:27,391
You gonna make it, dude.
You only got a little longer.

410
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:30,279
- You gonna make it.
- Grid five, seven, one-niner.

411
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:34,073
- Tell my mama...
- No, no, I don't...

412
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:42,009
Gooks in the bush.
Request firecracker salvo. Will adjust.

413
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:44,010
How copy? Over.

414
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:47,094
Roger. Solid copy.
Firecracker shot out.

415
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:49,803
Incoming!

416
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:52,896
Down! Down! Down!

417
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:55,361
Curtis, get down!
Curtis, get down!

418
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:39,855
Out-fucking-standing job.

419
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:43,155
Saddle up. Let's get to the rally point,
take that whirlybird home.

420
00:33:43,242 --> 00:33:46,945
- We got some beer to drink.
- We goin' to the rally point now?

421
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:53,967
The mission's been compromised.
We're goin' to site 37.

422
00:33:55,096 --> 00:33:57,055
It ain't compromised no more.

423
00:33:57,142 --> 00:34:00,181
They're dead.
Now this is Sneaky Pete.

424
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:03,774
Reconnaissance.
Some of them dead gooks...

425
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,907
they could have important
intelligence papers on their bodies.

426
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:12,951
All right.

427
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:15,377
- Move 'em out.
- Move out!

428
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:21,223
Hammerhead, Hammerhead.
Cobra on site of your mission now.

429
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:26,022
I count ten... say again, ten...
November-Victor-Alpha-Kilo-lndia-Alpha.

430
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:30,733
- How copy? Over.
- I copy, one-zero. Good job.

431
00:34:30,826 --> 00:34:33,782
Hammerhead, Cobra. Solid copy.
Good job. Cobra out.

432
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:41,798
Aw, shit, man! What you doin'?
He already dead.

433
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:55,489
Motherfucker.

434
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:57,738
Looks like we nailed us
an officer.

435
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:04,379
You lucky bastard. You get back to C.P.,
you name your own price, sir.

436
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:08,642
No way, D'Ambrosio.
I'm keepin' this one.

437
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:11,219
Been lookin' for one of these
since Cleon and I got here in '66.

438
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:14,109
Ain't that right, Cleon?

439
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,610
I walked right by that guy.

440
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:21,319
You gotta keep your eyes open.

441
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:34,929
Oh, man, what the fuck?

442
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:58,394
You hungry or somethin', Cleon?

443
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:02,947
Just like you, sir.

444
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:05,909
I'm collectin' me a souvenir.

445
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:13,129
Saddle up. We're movin' out.

446
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:18,886
That's all he's gonna say? You ain't got
nothin' to tell this fuckin' shit, man?

447
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,387
- Man, that nigger Cleon crazy.
- Yeah.

448
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:43,390
- Did you see that shit?
- I saw it.

449
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,560
- Nigger, did you see that shit?
- Yes.

450
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:48,146
I heard that nigger's supposed
to be a preacher's son and shit.

451
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:51,155
He cuttin' off motherfucker's
heads for souvenirs and shit.

452
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:54,244
Now, if you hadn't flunked out
of Hunter College, pimp daddy Skippy...

453
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:56,496
you would've missed all this
good shit down in Vietnam.

454
00:36:56,583 --> 00:37:00,714
Kiss my ass, nigger. You the reason
why I'm at this motherfucker anyway.

455
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:02,709
You didn't tell me 'bout
this recon shit.

456
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,129
- That's 'cause you didn't ask me
when you were writin' me. - Nigger, I didn't have to.

457
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,137
- Shit, I figured it was
better than being a grunt. - It is.

458
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,393
Ant, motherfucker,
we out in the woods all day.

459
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:13,853
Them motherfuckin' gooks jumpin' out
like Indians every five minutes.

460
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:16,736
- Man, a nigger
ain't made for this shit. - You thought this was a skate.

461
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,077
Nigger, ain't nothin'
wrong with no skate.

462
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:21,830
You could just call me
a skatin' motherfucker.

463
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:24,750
I skate my ass right out of here,
they give me a chance to.

464
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:30,513
- Ain't no shitbirds on my squad.
- Man, what you jivin' about?

465
00:37:46,587 --> 00:37:48,878
Hey. Hey.

466
00:37:49,008 --> 00:37:52,795
Ant. To the Bronx.

467
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:54,807
Yeah, uh...

468
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:58,224
to the youngblood
who couldn't be with us today.

469
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,315
- Lance Corporal Martin.
- To Lance Corporal Martin.

470
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:13,081
- Yes.
- Yo, Ant, man.

471
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:15,177
What they be puttin'
in your head out here, man?

472
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:18,682
I mean, you done got into this shit
a little bit too deep, don't you think?

473
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:22,348
You're in recon now, Skip.
You in deep too.

474
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:26,487
Man, fuck this shit, man.

475
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:28,783
- Oh, come on, man.
- Man, this ain't our war, man.

476
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:32,118
Shit, our black ass should be
back in the Bronx where we belong.

477
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:36,169
Joe-ass got lucky. They sent him
home, gettin' wounded and shit.

478
00:38:36,259 --> 00:38:38,930
Heard he wounded his hand
pretty bad, man.

479
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:41,975
Shit, that's all right, though.
He got out of this shit.

480
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:45,308
I rather be home with a fucked-up hand
up in some pussy than to be out here...

481
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:47,401
healthier than
a motherfucker without it.

482
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:50,574
- Shit.
- Same old Skip. Boy, you ain't changed.

483
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:52,576
That's right.

484
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,662
You heard from Juanita?

485
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,918
She used to write me a lot
during my first tour.

486
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:00,290
We got a package for ya!

487
00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:05,138
Turns out, man, before I left,
fucked around and got her pregnant.

488
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:09,021
- Man, you bullshittin'.
- No, I ain't.

489
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,272
- No shit?
- Dead serious, man. Got a little girl back at home.

490
00:39:12,364 --> 00:39:16,661
Oh, man, that's groovy, man. That's
groovy. I can dig it. That's cool.

491
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,699
Hey, dig, man, I know
you got a picture, man.

492
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:22,372
- Let me see her picture. Shit.
- Can't even look at her, man.

493
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:24,585
Man, what the fuck
you mean, bro?

494
00:39:24,678 --> 00:39:26,838
That's your little girl, man.
That's your baby.

495
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:29,431
You know how I survived
26 months in the bush?

496
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,901
Because I don't think about the world,
Skip. That shit don't exist to me.

497
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:36,236
I don't give a fuck about anything
or anyone in it...

498
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:41,160
because the minute I do, I'm a dead man
out here, and you remember that shit.

499
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:44,827
We'll talk about the world
when we get back.

500
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:47,420
Yeah, whatever, man.

501
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,675
I'm gonna go get high.

502
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:53,508
I mean real high. And I'm gonna
get my dick sucked too.

503
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:02,033
Big dick. Big.

504
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,369
Very, very big.
Can you handle it?

505
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:11,714
"Hey there, Kirby.
What's happenin' back in the world?

506
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:13,843
If you hadn't heard,
doin' my second tour."

507
00:40:15,475 --> 00:40:17,933
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

508
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,896
"We spend most of our time
livin' in the bush.

509
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:28,578
Kind of numb to
everything out here.

510
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:31,075
Tryin' to keep
my head clear.

511
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:34,423
Our lieutenant is this crazy
white boy named Dugan from Ohio.

512
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:41,809
He's good at gettin' us
out of crazy situations.

513
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:48,152
We got this one wild-ass
brother out here named Cleon."

514
00:40:48,284 --> 00:40:50,278
Gook fuck.

515
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:53,956
"His daddy's this big-time preacher, but
you'd never know from his crazy son."

516
00:40:54,043 --> 00:40:58,840
Now you're good.
Now Jesus loves you.

517
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:02,305
"He's from Mount Vernon.
Oh, yeah. You won't believe it...

518
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:05,063
but Skip volunteered
for my unit.

519
00:41:05,188 --> 00:41:07,063
I don't think he's
cut out for recon.

520
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:12,652
He's always gettin' high and shit,
tryin' to keep his mind off things.

521
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:16,738
Me, I'm just tryin' to take it one day
at a time and do what's right...

522
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:20,627
whatever that is.

523
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:23,255
See you when I get
back to the Bronx.

524
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:25,262
Anthony."

525
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:40,138
That fuckin' shit stinks.

526
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:46,947
I don't wanna pull rank, Cleon, but if
you don't get rid of that fuckin' head...

527
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:49,159
I don't hear nobody else
complainin' but you.

528
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,999
Well, maybe you should
listen to your team.

529
00:42:53,128 --> 00:42:56,000
Medical advice, Cleon:
You dump that shit.

530
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,172
Hey, Doc, shut the fuck up.
You don't know shit.

531
00:42:59,264 --> 00:43:02,932
Fuck you, man. It stinks like
a sack full of assholes.

532
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:05,935
Ain't a one of us got as much
as a splinter in his finger...

533
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,062
since I cut this head off.

534
00:43:08,196 --> 00:43:10,689
This head is our
good-luck charm.

535
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:16,245
Nah, this here's
our good-luck charm.

536
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:19,547
If you don't mind, Sergeant, l...
My vote is to get rid of it.

537
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:22,305
Man, Cleon, you need to get the fuck on
with that bullshit, man.

538
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,182
- That head smell like shit.
- Bottom line, Staff Sergeant.

539
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,403
You either get rid of that fuckin' head
A.S.A. fuckin' P., or I'm gonna...

540
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:35,780
have your ass court-martialed
when we get back to the rear.

541
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:38,451
We clear?

542
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,439
Cobra, Cobra, Delta six. Over.

543
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:55,190
Delta six, Delta six, Cobra.
Copy. Over.

544
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:57,446
Cobra, Delta six.
Execute Charlie, Michael...

545
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:02,698
We're in a world of shit now.
I just buried our luck.

546
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:06,586
Listen up. Change of mission.
A patrol from 25 has found...

547
00:44:06,675 --> 00:44:10,177
a shitload of weapons in a vill
about a klik and a half to our whisky.

548
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:12,182
Platoon commander wants us
to interrogate on the spot.

549
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:15,182
Betancourt, you're the closest one in
the area that speaks that gook shit.

550
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:19,647
So that's where we're headin'.
All right, saddle up. We're movin' out.

551
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:24,535
- So now where's D'Ambrosio?
- He went to go take a shit.

552
00:44:24,664 --> 00:44:27,372
- When?
- When Cleon was diggin' the hole.

553
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:29,378
- Why the hell didn't you go with him?
- You know how he is.

554
00:44:29,507 --> 00:44:32,759
- He don't like nobody around
when he's shittin'. - Oh, man.

555
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:35,178
Grab his shit.
Let's find him.

556
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:45,908
Aww.

557
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:48,909
Fuck! Doc.

558
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:52,080
- 360!
- D'Ambrosio, what'd they do?

559
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:56,261
You'll be all right.
Doc's gonna take care of you, okay?

560
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:06,353
This morphine is all
I can do for him right now.

561
00:45:11,748 --> 00:45:14,953
Here, Doc. You can use mine
if that's not enough.

562
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,126
Are you crazy? Another one of those
would kill him right now.

563
00:45:28,903 --> 00:45:31,443
What the fuck
you got there, Curtis?

564
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:35,484
Somethin' about
"Black men, go home.

565
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:38,620
This isn't your war."

566
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:42,125
You get rid of that cocksucking
commie bullshit right now.

567
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,849
- Yeah. Right.
- Hey, Curtis.

568
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,851
- Apply some pressure here.
- We gotta hump this man back to the rally point.

569
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:52,859
Oh, shit.

570
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:57,826
Save me, Curtis.

571
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,032
Look, Adam, you don't
worry 'bout nothin'.

572
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:02,327
We're a team,
okay, brother?

573
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:05,340
- We gonna take care of you.
- Please.

574
00:46:05,426 --> 00:46:08,513
Yeah. It's not much longer.
We're almost there.

575
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,684
Kill me.

576
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:15,941
Kill me!

577
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:20,107
I would do it
for you.

578
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:22,534
I would do it
for you, Curtis.

579
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:25,080
Buttermilk 17.
Cobra, over.

580
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:29,960
Cobra, Cobra. Buttermilk 17. Inbound
your buzz. Contact on your visual.

581
00:46:30,094 --> 00:46:31,970
- Shh.
- Buttermilk 17. Cobra.

582
00:46:32,098 --> 00:46:34,306
Hey, you gonna be all right.

583
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:37,771
The medevac will be here
in a minute.

584
00:46:37,899 --> 00:46:40,025
Do it.

585
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,994
You think
I don't mean it?

586
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:51,213
I can't go home like this.

587
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:54,586
- Hey, what's he saying?
- He's delirious, man.

588
00:47:00,982 --> 00:47:02,940
- Please.
- Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk.

589
00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:06,897
- Hooking direct to your 12. Stand by.
- Cobra standing by. Over.

590
00:47:52,698 --> 00:47:55,535
Shh-shh-shh.

591
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,289
Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk 17.
Roger your visual. Pop smoke. Over.

592
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:05,752
Buttermilk 17, Cobra.
Smoke. Over.

593
00:48:05,888 --> 00:48:09,094
Pop the smoke.
Get that man ready for medevac!

594
00:48:20,622 --> 00:48:23,910
- When'd he go?
- A few minutes ago.

595
00:48:25,422 --> 00:48:28,509
It's better to check out
than go home all fucked up.

596
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,849
No shit.

597
00:49:35,421 --> 00:49:38,210
Oh, shit!
Get down!

598
00:49:39,428 --> 00:49:42,099
Fuckin' assholes!

599
00:49:42,224 --> 00:49:45,430
- Stay down! Stay down!
- I'm gonna get these motherfuckers!

600
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:48,935
Return fire! Fire!

601
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,777
Get these motherfuckers!

602
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,245
- Skip! Return some fire!
- Shoot them motherfuckers!

603
00:49:58,378 --> 00:50:02,924
Mission aborted! We get the fuck
out of Dodge, back to the rally point!

604
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:06,264
Ferguson! Get some
fuckin' rounds goin'!

605
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:10,808
Skip! Cover me!

606
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,185
- Dugan!
- Dugan, wait!

607
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:19,116
Dugan!
Dugan!

608
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:32,979
Skip! Skip!
Snap out of that shit. Go!

609
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:36,732
- Fuck this, man.
Let's bug out, Cleon! - Cobra, move the fuck out!

610
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:39,022
- Get up! Come on!
- Move it! Move it!

611
00:50:39,158 --> 00:50:41,568
Move! Get up!
Get up! Come on!

612
00:50:52,222 --> 00:50:54,098
- What are you doin'?
- What is this, man?

613
00:50:54,226 --> 00:50:57,348
- Slow down, man.
- Fuckin' grunts!

614
00:50:57,441 --> 00:51:00,527
- Say, get a special shot for Skip.
My man's goin' home today. - Count of three: 1-2-3.

615
00:51:00,654 --> 00:51:03,028
All right. Good.
Now come on, now. Skip, come on, now.

616
00:51:03,116 --> 00:51:05,527
Let's see a dap, man.

617
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:15,469
- All right!
- Get one like this. Get one like this.

618
00:51:15,598 --> 00:51:17,592
Come on, now.
Everybody, come on. Get closer.

619
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:20,136
- Ah, man!
- This is Cobra, baby.

620
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:24,902
- Recon Cobra!
- It's Cobra. Hey, hey!

621
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:27,279
Team Cobra, ready?

622
00:51:45,399 --> 00:51:47,275
Come on

623
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,533
Come along, come on
and get up and get down too

624
00:51:57,254 --> 00:52:00,507
- Get down, get up
- Say, h-h-hold on a sec.

625
00:52:00,594 --> 00:52:04,595
- Keep the metre running.
- Get down, get up and move your feet

626
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:08,644
Come on and rise, rise, rise
Shake your get-up

627
00:52:08,774 --> 00:52:11,101
Straighten up there, marine!

628
00:52:14,576 --> 00:52:16,617
He a friend of yours?

629
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:19,156
Friend of yours and
I'll give a discount, marine.

630
00:52:19,293 --> 00:52:21,750
No, man.

631
00:52:24,135 --> 00:52:27,091
Oh, shit.

632
00:52:27,182 --> 00:52:29,591
Man, look who's back
in the motherfuckin' world.

633
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:33,105
Dig this motherfucker
right here, man.

634
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,072
Look at you, man. That's a mackin'
outfit if I've ever seen one.

635
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:39,777
- Look, with all the stripes and shit.
What, you a captain now? - No, man.

636
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:43,872
Look, man, you wear that motherfucker
for about a month, this nigger get all the pussy, man.

637
00:52:43,962 --> 00:52:47,131
Check this motherfucker out, man.

638
00:52:47,258 --> 00:52:50,880
Well, look, man... Yeah,
you go get me some squares, man.

639
00:52:50,973 --> 00:52:54,642
I gotta take care of a couple things,
baby. I'll get back with you. All right?

640
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:57,265
You stay up now, all right?

641
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:01,815
What's happening, blood?

642
00:53:01,951 --> 00:53:03,826
Hey, man, I'm back.

643
00:53:07,544 --> 00:53:09,455
My nigger!

644
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:14,139
Come on and get down

645
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:16,390
Hey, Luther!

646
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:18,312
Tell your sister I'm gonna
be over there later on.

647
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:20,772
Hey, fuck you!

648
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:26,407
Man, the neighbourhood is changin'.

649
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,872
Aw, it's still a good place.
White people movin' out, though.

650
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:34,794
Oh, dig. I saw Juanita
the other day, man.

651
00:53:34,884 --> 00:53:37,887
Man, she finer than a motherfucker.

652
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,804
Is that right?

653
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:44,267
You need to go check her out, man.
Go see your little daughter.

654
00:53:44,402 --> 00:53:47,155
Remember them big-ass ears
you had when you was young?

655
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,327
She got 'em, just like you.
That's how I know it was yours.

656
00:53:51,956 --> 00:53:54,960
So, what's up with Joe, man?
Is he, uh... Is he workin' or what?

657
00:53:55,087 --> 00:53:58,958
Aw, post office, you know.
Three-quarter gig, part-time.

658
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:01,931
He gotta do what he gotta do.
He got mouths to feed, you know.

659
00:54:02,057 --> 00:54:04,468
What about you, man?
How you doin'?

660
00:54:04,603 --> 00:54:06,432
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

661
00:54:06,565 --> 00:54:09,105
I'm cool, baby. I'm Skippy, baby.
I'm still pimpin'.

662
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,574
Need any money
or anything, you know?

663
00:54:14,663 --> 00:54:17,238
Man, I got over like a fat rat
when I got out, man.

664
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:20,920
Dig, I got my school money comin'
from the government once a month.

665
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,672
I got my veteran's cheque
comin' once a month.

666
00:54:23,804 --> 00:54:28,386
I got my fifty percent medical cheque
comin' to me for the rest of my life.

667
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,933
I ain't gotta do a goddam thing else
but go to the mailbox, you dig?

668
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,741
Hey, man, how the hell you pull
a fifty percent medical?

669
00:54:34,824 --> 00:54:36,865
Nigger, you ain't disabled.

670
00:54:36,995 --> 00:54:38,870
Man, some shit got
into me over there, man.

671
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:42,125
What?

672
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,666
All I know is my blood cells
are all fucked up.

673
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:48,376
Some nights I wake up
in cold sweats and shit.

674
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,259
Don't look at me like that, man.
It ain't the heroin.

675
00:54:52,354 --> 00:54:55,892
The heroin ain't never did nothin'
to me. A lot of vets comin' down with this shit.

676
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:59,114
- And they don't know what it is?
- Square biz.

677
00:55:01,537 --> 00:55:06,286
Damn. Look, man, you wanna
come on in the crib or somethin', man?

678
00:55:06,379 --> 00:55:08,754
Nah, man. I'm cool, baby.
Hey, I'm gonna split.

679
00:55:08,884 --> 00:55:11,721
But you here, baby. You home.
We got plenty of time to do our thing.

680
00:55:11,847 --> 00:55:13,640
You know what I'm sayin'?

681
00:55:18,651 --> 00:55:20,561
- Brother.
- Brother. Go see your mama.

682
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:23,534
- Right on. I'm gonna check her out.
- With her fine ass.

683
00:55:23,617 --> 00:55:25,695
You know, I been takin' care
of your mama while you been gone.

684
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,699
Boy, I'll kick your head in.
Don't talk like that.

685
00:55:41,274 --> 00:55:42,852
Mmm.

686
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:55,713
You all right?

687
00:55:57,094 --> 00:55:58,637
Yeah.

688
00:56:00,683 --> 00:56:04,731
Well, can't you look me in my eyes?
I ain't seen you in four years.

689
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,034
Well, what'd you do over there?
What was it like?

690
00:56:16,169 --> 00:56:20,715
Look, uh, I'd rather not
talk about that right now.

691
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:22,802
Well, Anthony, you gonna have
to tell us something.

692
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:26,801
Now, you know a lot of them boys
went over there and got hooked on them drugs and stuff. You know.

693
00:56:26,937 --> 00:56:30,773
Look, I was in a special unit
out there...

694
00:56:30,861 --> 00:56:33,355
and bad habits could've cost us
our lives.

695
00:56:33,492 --> 00:56:35,450
Well, that's what I'm talkin' about,
them bad habits, honey.

696
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:39,870
Now, if you picked up some of them
things, there's a lot of places you can go and get help.

697
00:56:40,003 --> 00:56:42,460
No bad habits, Ma.

698
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:45,124
'Cept a little killin'.

699
00:56:45,219 --> 00:56:47,094
For my country, of course.

700
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:50,887
Hey. Let me give you some more
of these collards.

701
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:52,683
- Yeah.
- Baby, this sure is good.

702
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:13,634
Oh, shit. Look who back.
Look at this motherfuckin' man.

703
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:16,602
- Hey, what's happenin', youngblood?
- What's goin' on, cool breeze?

704
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:20,652
- Long time, no see.
- All right now, Pops. What's happenin'?

705
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:25,157
Hey there. What's goin' on, blood?
Ain't seen you in a long time, man.

706
00:57:25,248 --> 00:57:27,623
- Boy just got back.
- Hey, blood. - All right.

707
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:31,290
- Cheers. My man. Drink!
- All right. How you feel? All right.

708
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:36,219
Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey, I got next game.

709
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,885
- You know that's my table.
- You call that a break?

710
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:42,318
- I got the thing made
- Hold up there, now. It's my shot.

711
00:57:42,446 --> 00:57:45,900
Say, chump.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

712
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,247
- Ha-ha!
- My man, Joe! What's happenin'?

713
00:57:51,336 --> 00:57:54,755
- Oh, look at you!
- How you doin', man?

714
00:57:54,843 --> 00:57:57,633
- Good, man. What's goin' on, man?
- Jesus Christ, man.

715
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,925
- I can't believe it's you!
You cool, man! - What's goin' on, man?

716
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,939
Say, man,
I heard you got wounded out there.

717
00:58:03,065 --> 00:58:07,481
Yeah, man. I was in demolitions
and my fuckin' hand gets blown off, man.

718
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:11,662
- Oh, man. Shit.
- Yeah, man. But hey...

719
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,995
motherfuckers told me everything there
is to know about explosives, man!

720
00:58:15,128 --> 00:58:18,630
- That right?
- Check you out, Pappy. You got all those kids now.

721
00:58:18,718 --> 00:58:21,805
Man, hey. You gotta check out Kirby,
man. He's over in the back room.

722
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:24,015
Yeah. Let's go on back.
He's still back here, huh?

723
00:58:24,145 --> 00:58:26,768
- All right. Dig it.
- Hey. Abre la puerta! Hey! Hey!

724
00:58:26,858 --> 00:58:29,267
Doin' all right. You know, Kirby just
all hangin' in there, you know?

725
00:58:29,362 --> 00:58:31,486
- Who the fuck is it?
- It's me.

726
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,782
Blood! What's up, blood?

727
00:58:33,871 --> 00:58:35,579
- Hey, Nicky. What's happenin', man?
- Skin!

728
00:58:35,706 --> 00:58:37,499
Kirby back there, man.

729
00:58:37,627 --> 00:58:39,336
That boy looked at me,
he say, "Kirby...

730
00:58:39,463 --> 00:58:43,334
when she pulled off them drawers,
I thought I'd never stop seein' ass!"

731
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:50,312
- What's happenin', Captain?
- Who the fuck is that?

732
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,940
- Youngblood?
- Yeah, it's me!

733
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:56,949
Youngblood! Come on, boy!

734
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:03,163
- How you doin'? Come on
in the back here, boy. Come on. - Oh, boy. All right.

735
00:59:08,097 --> 00:59:12,727
Man, I been everywhere
lookin' for a gig.

736
00:59:12,856 --> 00:59:16,275
Aw, motherfuckers forget about you
gettin' your ass almost blown off...

737
00:59:16,404 --> 00:59:17,899
or whatever the fuck.

738
00:59:18,031 --> 00:59:21,783
Yeah. Look, uh, Kirby, uh...

739
00:59:21,912 --> 00:59:25,249
I was thinkin', man.
Maybe, uh, come back and work for you.

740
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:28,215
What? Work for me?

741
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:32,252
Yeah. You know. Runnin' numbers.
Like we used to do.

742
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:36,598
Shh. Fuckin' pigs run me
out of business.

743
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:41,028
How... How the pigs run you
outta business, man? You had 'em on the payroll.

744
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:43,149
Pigs are greedy.

745
00:59:43,284 --> 00:59:45,444
And you gotta remember I'm dealing
with the NYPD...

746
00:59:45,538 --> 00:59:48,161
greediest, most corrupt pigs
on the face of the earth.

747
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,500
So I got the fuck out.

748
00:59:51,632 --> 00:59:54,755
I told that motherfucker I'd rather
eat cat shit with a knittin' needle.

749
00:59:54,847 --> 00:59:58,682
I wasn't gonna bust my ass sendin'
some cop kids to college. Shit.

750
01:00:00,188 --> 01:00:02,646
I dig it.

751
01:00:02,735 --> 01:00:05,227
This place ain't never
made much money.

752
01:00:05,364 --> 01:00:08,985
So I'm just hustlin' here and there.

753
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:11,406
Tryin' to get over,
just like everybody else.

754
01:00:15,757 --> 01:00:17,882
It's gonna be all right, kid.

755
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:21,678
Here's to gettin' over.

756
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:25,306
I hope, man. Hope. Shit.

757
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:32,450
- You afraid of blood?
- Uh, that's all I been around for the past three years.

758
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:37,703
Anthony Curtis.

759
01:00:37,797 --> 01:00:41,085
You related to Tony?
The actor?

760
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:45,552
N-No. Not...
Oh! The act... No, no, no.

761
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:48,642
- Different colour, right?
- Yeah! He's a white cat. Yeah.

762
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:52,395
And his name was Schwartz.
Schwartz, not Curtis.

763
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:55,362
- Okay.
- Know anything about butchering?

764
01:00:55,453 --> 01:00:57,246
Uh, I'm a fast learner.

765
01:00:57,331 --> 01:00:59,242
Here, put that on.

766
01:01:00,713 --> 01:01:02,837
- Here. Take this.
- Need some help, man!

767
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:04,961
All right.

768
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:29,759
Hey, uh, is Juanita in?

769
01:01:29,846 --> 01:01:32,220
No, she's not,
but she'll be back in a...

770
01:01:34,396 --> 01:01:36,307
in a while.

771
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,776
So you gonna stand out there,
or you comin' in?

772
01:01:41,868 --> 01:01:43,779
I'm gonna come on in.

773
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:48,661
Girl, check you out.

774
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:55,472
I thought you were goin' over
to the communists.

775
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:59,096
Ah. Nah. Not me.

776
01:01:59,231 --> 01:02:01,724
Now, dig, if you were smart,
that's what you would've done.

777
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:03,902
What?

778
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,738
Man, you don't know what the hell
you talkin' about, girl.

779
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:10,953
No, it's cool. I mean it's not your
fault you been brainwashed by America.

780
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:16,427
I mean, at least you made it back
alive, right?

781
01:02:16,554 --> 01:02:19,926
You know, "Hello, how you doin'?"
That would've been real nice...

782
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:23,265
before you got off
onto all this political shit.

783
01:02:25,277 --> 01:02:28,281
Welcome home.

784
01:02:28,408 --> 01:02:30,818
And welcome to the revolution.

785
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:38,209
- So, this is Sarah's?
- Mm-hmm.

786
01:02:40,178 --> 01:02:42,089
Oh, wow.

787
01:02:44,644 --> 01:02:49,061
- So, is she a smart baby?
- Ahh.

788
01:02:49,152 --> 01:02:51,396
Why don't you find out for yourself?

789
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:59,795
Hey, y'all. Sorry I'm late.
Traffic on the Cross Bronx was a mess.

790
01:03:02,635 --> 01:03:06,506
Oh. All righty.

791
01:03:06,642 --> 01:03:08,802
There we go.

792
01:03:08,938 --> 01:03:10,731
There you go.

793
01:03:10,858 --> 01:03:13,351
Go play with your blocks.
Go play with your blocks.

794
01:03:23,254 --> 01:03:25,165
Hey.

795
01:03:35,484 --> 01:03:39,567
Oh, no. Look, Juanita.
I'm in one piece.

796
01:03:45,043 --> 01:03:46,918
Hey, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

797
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:50,798
Come here, Sarah.
Come to Mommy.

798
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:55,095
Good girl. Come here.
Look at that.

799
01:03:55,228 --> 01:03:57,803
- That's Daddy. Say hi.
- Hi.

800
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,268
This is Sarah Marie Curtis.

801
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,481
- Hi.
- Hello.

802
01:04:02,615 --> 01:04:05,369
Hold her, silly. She's yours.

803
01:04:05,453 --> 01:04:07,329
Oh.

804
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:09,866
Hey. Mmm.

805
01:04:13,843 --> 01:04:15,125
Hey, um...

806
01:04:15,263 --> 01:04:18,682
Oh, yeah. Be advised.
What's goin' on, my brothers?

807
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:25,273
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah. This is home.

808
01:04:25,406 --> 01:04:27,899
Dig it. Dig it.

809
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:29,822
Check out Sleepin' Beauty
back there.

810
01:04:32,252 --> 01:04:35,338
Boy, I still can't get over
how gorgeous she is.

811
01:04:35,466 --> 01:04:37,376
Oh, she got that from her mama.

812
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,469
Oh. Okay.

813
01:04:42,937 --> 01:04:45,512
You know, Juanita...

814
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:50,529
I wanna let you know l...
I did miss you. A lot.

815
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:53,116
Don't you think I know that, Anthony?

816
01:04:53,205 --> 01:04:57,075
It's not important anyway. The important
thing is that you're here now.

817
01:04:57,212 --> 01:04:59,586
Shh. Come here.

818
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,672
Oh.

819
01:05:19,668 --> 01:05:21,745
Hey, baby girl.

820
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,207
Hey, Cutty.

821
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:29,048
Came by to see you a little earlier,
but you weren't home.

822
01:05:31,939 --> 01:05:33,649
Oh, you know I had class tonight
after work...

823
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:35,901
and then I stopped over by my mother's.

824
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:41,277
- Oh, yeah. I forgot. It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

825
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,910
I see my little girl's sleepin'
back there, huh?

826
01:05:45,005 --> 01:05:47,924
Yeah. She's all played out.

827
01:05:51,266 --> 01:05:54,720
- Cutty, I wanted you to meet, um...
- Look here.

828
01:05:54,814 --> 01:05:57,307
- Got a little somethin' for Sarah.
- Smiling faces

829
01:05:57,443 --> 01:06:02,274
- Buy her something real nice.
- Smiling faces sometimes

830
01:06:02,368 --> 01:06:05,122
Hey, Cutty, I told you
to stop spoilin' her like this.

831
01:06:05,248 --> 01:06:07,575
Smiling faces

832
01:06:07,669 --> 01:06:11,255
Smiling faces tell lies

833
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:14,797
- Somebody's gotta do it.
- And I got proof

834
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:19,016
- Beware
- Cutty, I want you to meet Anthony.

835
01:06:24,282 --> 01:06:27,072
Okay. All right.

836
01:06:27,204 --> 01:06:30,207
Let me just put her to bed. You come on
in and make yourself at home.

837
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:32,210
Come on in.

838
01:06:56,547 --> 01:06:59,337
Okay. Can I get you something
to drink, or...

839
01:06:59,428 --> 01:07:03,049
Look, Juanita.
Uh, I think I better go.

840
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,345
But you just got here.

841
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,190
Who knows, you could be
expectin' company or something.

842
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:11,606
Nobody's comin' here, Anthony.

843
01:07:11,741 --> 01:07:13,617
I think I still should go.

844
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:21,036
Anthony.

845
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:23,590
I used to see Cutty.
Is that what you wanna hear?

846
01:07:23,678 --> 01:07:26,467
Oh. Blood made that very clear to me.

847
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,677
So then, what's the problem?

848
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:31,102
Problem?

849
01:07:31,192 --> 01:07:35,108
Why, man throwed two yards on your car.

850
01:07:35,198 --> 01:07:38,368
You askin' me what's the problem?
Shit. Obviously nothin'.

851
01:07:38,496 --> 01:07:40,455
Don't come up in here judgin' me.

852
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:43,254
What the fuck, man?
You got a pimp around my daughter?

853
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:45,131
Oh, he is not a pimp.

854
01:07:45,258 --> 01:07:47,467
And besides, if you cared anything
about havin' a daughter...

855
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,171
you'd have wrote me back
after I sent you our picture.

856
01:07:50,309 --> 01:07:52,350
But don't jump on me
for havin' a life.

857
01:07:52,479 --> 01:07:54,770
You didn't want one with me.

858
01:07:56,653 --> 01:07:59,906
So now what?

859
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,990
Are you gonna leave?

860
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:04,998
Some bullshit.

861
01:08:12,598 --> 01:08:14,639
Come here.

862
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:17,398
Come on. Come here.

863
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:32,165
Ooh, hey

864
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:36,390
Ya gotta, gotta payback
Payback

865
01:08:36,515 --> 01:08:38,723
- Damn!
- Revenge

866
01:08:44,446 --> 01:08:47,152
A man
The big payback

867
01:08:47,284 --> 01:08:49,242
Got to get back

868
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:51,579
Cleanup time, Cowboy.

869
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:55,162
See, man, why the fuck
you always gotta talk some shit?

870
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:58,836
Payback
Right there

871
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:02,094
- See, that's why I kicked his fuckin'
ass when he was a little kid, man. - Payback

872
01:09:02,186 --> 01:09:06,021
- Always gettin' smart and shit.
- A man

873
01:09:06,151 --> 01:09:08,644
Get down with my girlfriend

874
01:09:10,033 --> 01:09:12,740
That ain't right

875
01:09:12,871 --> 01:09:15,494
Now you gonna play this marine
war hero.

876
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,786
Out of touch

877
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,004
You know what I think?

878
01:09:20,134 --> 01:09:22,840
- I think y'all was some goddam fools
goin' over there... - Gonna fight

879
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:25,547
fightin' that white man's war.

880
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:28,688
- That's right.
- Payback everything you got to see

881
01:09:28,774 --> 01:09:31,980
- What you got when you get
back here, huh? - Yeah

882
01:09:32,072 --> 01:09:34,564
- Never do any damn thing
- Not a goddam thing.

883
01:09:37,414 --> 01:09:40,168
Course, you do got
that fine-ass Juanita.

884
01:09:40,253 --> 01:09:43,540
- Throw me out
- Now, what the fuck you lookin' at me like that for, man?

885
01:09:43,675 --> 01:09:45,219
I'm just complimentin' you
on your taste.

886
01:09:45,345 --> 01:09:49,891
Throw me away
You had all the rage

887
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:53,101
- You had me down
- Course you know...

888
01:09:53,233 --> 01:09:55,311
- That's the facts
- Baddest motherfucker this side of Nicky Barnes...

889
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:57,772
- Now, you punk
- My boss man Cutty...

890
01:09:57,908 --> 01:10:00,448
Gettin' ready for the big payback

891
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,408
I thought that might ring a bell.

892
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:04,785
The big payback
That's where I learned

893
01:10:04,921 --> 01:10:08,375
He used to tap that ass
while you was over in Nam.

894
01:10:08,469 --> 01:10:10,380
- The big payback
- Motherfucker!

895
01:10:10,473 --> 01:10:14,805
- Goddam!
- You do some fuckin' talkin', don't you, goddam it!

896
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:16,732
Try this on, motherfucker.

897
01:10:16,817 --> 01:10:19,440
- No, no, no. He needs his ass whipped.
- What you mean "no"?

898
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,572
Get the fuck outta here!
Talk shit now, huh, motherfucker?

899
01:10:24,665 --> 01:10:27,786
- Shut the fuck up. Come on. Come on.
Motherfucker. Now what? - I'm ready to be respected

900
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,378
You wanna fuck with me or what?
I'm gonna fuckin' kill your ass!

901
01:10:30,508 --> 01:10:33,132
- Say somethin' now, motherfucker.
- That's enough, youngblood.

902
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:37,517
- Pull out your goddam knife!
- No! That's enough. Come on!

903
01:10:37,645 --> 01:10:39,473
- I gonna kill this motherfucker!
- That's enough!

904
01:10:39,565 --> 01:10:41,440
That mother! I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker!

905
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:44,102
- Let me go, Kirby! Let me go!
- No. He's already beat up. Come on now.

906
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:48,994
- Oh, shit.
- Come on. Let's go get some air.

907
01:10:49,124 --> 01:10:51,498
Don't need no fuckin' air!
Let me go!

908
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:53,877
- Let me hit him, hit him, hit him
- That's game.

909
01:11:16,464 --> 01:11:18,374
Shit.

910
01:11:18,467 --> 01:11:21,007
Gonna have the aeroplane corn bread.

911
01:11:21,097 --> 01:11:23,554
Here we go.
Ooh!

912
01:11:23,643 --> 01:11:26,218
- You gonna spoil that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

913
01:11:26,356 --> 01:11:29,110
Gonna spoil that one in your belly too.

914
01:11:29,236 --> 01:11:32,156
I don't need no spoiled kids.

915
01:11:32,241 --> 01:11:34,235
Hey, why not?

916
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:36,163
Not enough black babies are spoiled.

917
01:11:36,248 --> 01:11:38,707
Ain't that right, Sarah, hmm?

918
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:40,665
You got a point there.

919
01:11:41,758 --> 01:11:43,883
Come on. Sit on down.

920
01:11:46,058 --> 01:11:49,014
Big girl. Come here.

921
01:11:50,775 --> 01:11:52,650
Come here.

922
01:11:54,071 --> 01:11:56,743
Look at you.

923
01:11:56,827 --> 01:11:59,035
Fat girl.

924
01:11:59,122 --> 01:12:01,697
See what we got ourselves here.

925
01:12:01,793 --> 01:12:04,881
Oh, you know what? I think we're gonna
have ourselves a little boy.

926
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:09,593
Yeah, come on, man.
You got to be a boy.

927
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:12,597
Boy, boy, boy. Mm.

928
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:17,360
Ant Junior.
See, it's the power of the mind.

929
01:12:17,488 --> 01:12:19,981
We will ourselves a little boy.

930
01:12:21,954 --> 01:12:24,281
Then can you will yourself
a better job?

931
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:30,498
Can you will yourself to stop
drinkin' so much?

932
01:12:30,636 --> 01:12:33,510
Come on, honey.
Don't even start that shit, all right?

933
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:36,846
I thought we supposed to be havin'
a nice time here.

934
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,951
Look, Juanita.

935
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,167
l-I'm gonna get myself
a... a good job.

936
01:12:49,253 --> 01:12:53,170
You know how long you been singin'
that same old song now, Anthony?

937
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:56,013
I mean, in case you haven't noticed,
this here's the real world.

938
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:58,513
Ain't no free meals here
like in the marines.

939
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:05,019
Say, let me tell you somethin'.
Wasn't nothin' free in the marines.

940
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,951
I earned every meal
and every fuckin' dollar, all right?

941
01:13:12,626 --> 01:13:14,537
Look, everything's gonna be cool.

942
01:13:18,053 --> 01:13:20,592
You know I'll be
five months next week.

943
01:13:20,724 --> 01:13:23,977
You're five months pregnant,
you can't be no nurse's aide.

944
01:13:24,105 --> 01:13:25,980
I said we'll be all right.

945
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:11,557
Hey, um... Anybody want some speed?

946
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:14,396
Get the fuck outta here
with that shit.

947
01:14:14,528 --> 01:14:16,901
Say, why don't you
cut the bullshit, Joe?

948
01:14:17,032 --> 01:14:19,952
Can't you clear your mind
for one sec, man?

949
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,198
Now, you sure that they
pick up cash money?

950
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,244
Hey, cash money, bro.

951
01:14:24,379 --> 01:14:26,788
Like clockwork, once a month.
Then they stop by the post office...

952
01:14:26,883 --> 01:14:30,171
before they make their final run
to Washington, man.

953
01:14:30,263 --> 01:14:33,219
All the way to Washington, D.C.,
where they burn the money.

954
01:14:33,352 --> 01:14:35,512
Can you believe that shit?

955
01:14:35,606 --> 01:14:38,182
Old bills, man.
Sometimes a couple million.

956
01:14:38,278 --> 01:14:41,364
- How many guards?
- Four.

957
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:44,073
Two in the front
and one in the back carry revolvers.

958
01:14:44,205 --> 01:14:48,870
The other one, 12-gauge shotgun, man.

959
01:14:48,963 --> 01:14:50,756
You think we can take 'em?

960
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,677
I can't say, man.
I mean...

961
01:14:56,769 --> 01:14:59,891
four guards, and all of 'em
packin'?

962
01:14:59,983 --> 01:15:03,854
I put up the guns. I get the money
together to get the plans goin'.

963
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:05,949
But you got to be the master planner.

964
01:15:06,036 --> 01:15:08,611
You got medals for blowin'
motherfuckers up out there.

965
01:15:08,749 --> 01:15:12,999
- Man, I heard you were like John Wayne.
- Well, then that's the deal.

966
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:15,290
Yeah, all that money.

967
01:15:15,426 --> 01:15:17,301
Ah, man.

968
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:22,437
Anthony. You down?

969
01:15:25,652 --> 01:15:27,528
- Ahh.
- The look

970
01:15:28,909 --> 01:15:31,828
- Of love
- Let's drink on it anyway.

971
01:15:31,914 --> 01:15:36,414
- Is in your eyes
- Mmm.

972
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,045
- Ahh.
- A look

973
01:15:40,179 --> 01:15:42,173
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Your heart

974
01:15:42,308 --> 01:15:46,439
- Say, man. Shhh.
- Can't disguise - Hmm?

975
01:15:46,565 --> 01:15:50,269
Put the goddam thing away.
Get your little pyromaniac ass...

976
01:15:50,363 --> 01:15:53,152
- You gonna be walkin' in a minute.
- Aw, cool out, Kirby, man.

977
01:15:53,284 --> 01:15:55,992
I'm not gonna burn your car.
Not yet, at least.

978
01:16:04,179 --> 01:16:07,348
Don't go

979
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:09,850
Forget it, Juanita.

980
01:16:09,939 --> 01:16:11,850
Come on. Watch out there.

981
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,866
The look of love

982
01:16:20,917 --> 01:16:23,457
What's the problem, Anthony?

983
01:16:23,589 --> 01:16:27,292
What is it? I mean,
is it because I'm pregnant?

984
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:29,174
Shh. Come on.
Now, don't be silly.

985
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:31,175
So, then what's the problem?

986
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,276
Come on. Talk to me.
What is it?

987
01:16:42,455 --> 01:16:45,209
I told you. You need to
leave that alcohol alone.

988
01:17:10,128 --> 01:17:12,918
- No! No!
- Anthony! Anthony, baby!

989
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:15,133
It's me.
It's me. It's all right.

990
01:17:15,221 --> 01:17:17,132
It's all right.
Come here.

991
01:17:17,224 --> 01:17:21,890
Shh. Shh. Shh.
It's just another dream.

992
01:17:22,024 --> 01:17:23,900
It's just another dream.

993
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:33,910
This is my best cut,
Mrs Stein. Enjoy.

994
01:17:34,046 --> 01:17:36,586
Thank you very much, Saul.

995
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:40,421
- He's such a nice man.
- What did he give you?

996
01:17:40,558 --> 01:17:42,599
- We need to talk.
- Oh.

997
01:17:46,568 --> 01:17:49,655
- So what's happenin'?
- You're a good man.

998
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:53,610
Aw, come on, Saul.
I ain't got time to kibitz with ya. I got a whole lot of meat to cut.

999
01:17:55,834 --> 01:17:57,745
I'm closing down the shop.

1000
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,554
Should've told you sooner,
but I thought maybe...

1001
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:05,214
business, you know,
pick up a little.

1002
01:18:06,938 --> 01:18:08,598
Sorry.

1003
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,779
- Here.
- Oh, no, look, Saul... No. I can't.

1004
01:18:13,908 --> 01:18:16,865
What am I gonna do with it?
I have to get rid of it.

1005
01:18:16,956 --> 01:18:18,664
Come on.

1006
01:18:26,472 --> 01:18:28,383
Now I know

1007
01:18:28,474 --> 01:18:32,261
We have great respect

1008
01:18:32,398 --> 01:18:35,272
For the sister and mother

1009
01:18:35,404 --> 01:18:37,279
It's even better yet

1010
01:18:39,745 --> 01:18:42,320
But there's the joker in the street

1011
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:46,459
Here you go, brother.
Don't let the bullshit get to you.

1012
01:18:46,548 --> 01:18:48,459
I'm tryin', man. I'm tryin'.

1013
01:18:48,552 --> 01:18:50,760
You wanna get the man's foot
off your neck?

1014
01:18:50,848 --> 01:18:53,721
Come check us out.

1015
01:18:53,853 --> 01:18:56,690
Take care of yourself, brother.
Live righteous.

1016
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:59,191
Here you go, brother.
Here you go.

1017
01:18:59,322 --> 01:19:02,360
Take care of yourself, brother.
Come see us now.

1018
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:04,654
Don't let us hang around this town

1019
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:09,046
- Here you go, sister.
- And let what others say come true

1020
01:19:09,172 --> 01:19:10,750
Brothers and sisters, here you go.

1021
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:28,854
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Hey, youngblood.

1022
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:34,119
Bringin' in the groceries, huh?

1023
01:19:35,665 --> 01:19:38,158
Lord, have mercy.

1024
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:40,967
Man, I remember
when I was married.

1025
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:44,261
I used to love
to bring home the groceries.

1026
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,841
Made me feel real good.

1027
01:19:46,977 --> 01:19:51,025
Like a man. Know what I mean?

1028
01:19:52,361 --> 01:19:54,154
Hey, listen, youngblood. Uh...

1029
01:19:54,281 --> 01:19:56,240
I just dropped by
to see Juanita and Sarah.

1030
01:19:56,368 --> 01:19:59,372
- You know, lay a little
somethin' on 'em. - Stopped by to see my baby?

1031
01:19:59,499 --> 01:20:01,160
Is that right?

1032
01:20:01,294 --> 01:20:03,169
You know, youngblood...

1033
01:20:03,297 --> 01:20:06,300
I took care of your woman and your baby
when you were in the war.

1034
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:09,840
Now, a man oughta get a little respect
for somethin' like that.

1035
01:20:09,934 --> 01:20:11,679
Now, I ain't gonna lie to you.

1036
01:20:11,771 --> 01:20:15,190
I care about Juanita.
I care about her a whole lot.

1037
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:19,325
But you back now, and I'm gone.

1038
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:23,078
So from this point on, you should
consider me like a friend of the family.

1039
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:25,368
Find yourself in a jam and shit,
need a little cash...

1040
01:20:25,503 --> 01:20:28,340
you come see me,
I'll front you.

1041
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:30,882
- Keep your shit.
- Listen, brother.

1042
01:20:30,971 --> 01:20:33,215
I know about pride.

1043
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,391
But you got mouths to feed.

1044
01:20:35,521 --> 01:20:37,431
Now, I laid a little cash
on Juanita.

1045
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:40,403
Say, man, stay the fuck
away from my family.

1046
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:42,113
What did you say?

1047
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:44,698
You heard me, goddam it.

1048
01:20:44,787 --> 01:20:46,829
I said, "Stay the fuck away
from my family."

1049
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,789
See, I ain't the enemy, youngblood.

1050
01:20:53,636 --> 01:20:55,761
I don't want no trouble.

1051
01:21:02,945 --> 01:21:04,939
Shit.

1052
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:14,001
See, I tried to be a friend,
motherfucker.

1053
01:21:21,686 --> 01:21:23,596
Surprise, nigger.

1054
01:21:26,068 --> 01:21:28,988
Big bad marines.

1055
01:21:29,074 --> 01:21:30,984
Look at you now.

1056
01:21:32,162 --> 01:21:34,702
Does she suck you?

1057
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:36,377
Fuck you?

1058
01:21:37,506 --> 01:21:40,177
Make you feel like a man?

1059
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:42,171
Make you feel real good?

1060
01:21:44,184 --> 01:21:47,021
Huh, boy?

1061
01:21:47,147 --> 01:21:50,020
Now, she wasn't doin' it like that
before you went to the war, now was she?

1062
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,951
Now you gettin'
all that good lovin'...

1063
01:21:58,417 --> 01:22:01,088
and you can't even put food
on your fuckin' table.

1064
01:22:02,883 --> 01:22:06,504
Come on, Santa Claus.
Open your mouth and suck this.

1065
01:22:06,598 --> 01:22:09,221
Come on. I got a present for you.
Suck it!

1066
01:22:09,353 --> 01:22:12,890
- Suck it, nigger!
- Kill me, motherfucker.

1067
01:22:12,984 --> 01:22:14,943
Shoot me right now.

1068
01:22:15,071 --> 01:22:16,900
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1069
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:26,465
You lucky this is personal, nigger.

1070
01:22:26,591 --> 01:22:28,751
I ain't gonna kill you
over no woman.

1071
01:22:29,972 --> 01:22:31,967
Don't you ever...

1072
01:22:32,101 --> 01:22:34,095
in your fuckin' life...

1073
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:37,849
bite the hand
that feeds you, nigger.

1074
01:22:44,957 --> 01:22:47,247
See ya, Santa Claus.

1075
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:56,056
- Hold still now.
- I'm all right.

1076
01:22:56,186 --> 01:22:58,560
- Hold still.
- No, I'm all right. Damn!

1077
01:23:15,385 --> 01:23:18,342
You givin' him that money back.

1078
01:23:18,433 --> 01:23:20,890
He won't take it back.

1079
01:23:21,021 --> 01:23:25,187
What the fuck you talkin'...
You better get his shit back to him!

1080
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:29,321
Even if I wanted to give it back to him,
Anthony, he wouldn't take it back.

1081
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:33,411
W-W-W-Wait. What the fuck you talkin'
about, "if you wanted to give it back"?

1082
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:36,332
No, no, no, no.
Fuck that shit.

1083
01:23:36,424 --> 01:23:40,009
Have you forgotten you just lost your
damn job? We need that fuckin' money.

1084
01:23:40,097 --> 01:23:42,850
- We don't need his money.
- Yeah, well, Anthony, I'll tell you what.

1085
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:47,350
You start bringin' some real money
in here, like a real man, and then I'll think about givin' it back to him.

1086
01:23:47,442 --> 01:23:50,980
Until then, I don't wanna hear shit.

1087
01:23:51,115 --> 01:23:55,912
You need to get your tight ass together,
that's what you need to do, and stop feelin' sorry for your damn self.

1088
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:59,912
Sometimes it's like you ain't even
the same man I knew before the war.

1089
01:24:00,048 --> 01:24:03,087
That's who I was in love with.
That's who I thought showed the fuck back up here.

1090
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,094
I don't know who the fuck you are.

1091
01:24:06,184 --> 01:24:09,021
So, what? You just, uh,
suck his dick so good...

1092
01:24:09,147 --> 01:24:12,235
he just start
throwin' money at you, right?

1093
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,982
What is with you?

1094
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:17,153
Why you so damn paranoid?
I ain't fuckin' him.

1095
01:24:17,287 --> 01:24:19,328
Not at this moment, you ain't. No.

1096
01:24:19,457 --> 01:24:21,167
But the motherfucker
ain't sniffin' around here...

1097
01:24:21,294 --> 01:24:24,084
tossin' money in your
motherfuckin' face for nothin'!

1098
01:24:24,174 --> 01:24:27,296
Yeah, well, I sleep with you
every night, don't I?

1099
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,766
You know, Juanita,
that's a damn good question.

1100
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,400
Come on. Go ahead.

1101
01:24:35,527 --> 01:24:38,234
Admit this shit, man. Be honest.
You fuckin' him, right?

1102
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:40,859
- Is that what you wanna hear, Anthony?
That's what you wanna hear? - Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.

1103
01:24:40,995 --> 01:24:43,702
Fine. I'm fuckin' him.

1104
01:24:47,256 --> 01:24:50,129
So, uh, whose baby is that?

1105
01:24:53,225 --> 01:24:55,635
D-Don't even answer that shit.

1106
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,854
No, you right. I ain't gonna answer it.
I mean, shit. You Anthony.

1107
01:24:57,942 --> 01:25:01,396
You the big marine man with no damn job.
You know every fuckin' thing.

1108
01:25:01,532 --> 01:25:07,539
Answer this for me: If you think
I'm jivin' you so much, Anthony, why the hell you with me? Huh?

1109
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:11,578
Why the fuck you with me?
What, you think I need you? Do you think I need this shit?

1110
01:25:11,716 --> 01:25:14,089
Fuck. You can't get a decent job,
you won't fuck me.

1111
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:17,010
The only time I get to
hold you is when you're havin' one of them silly-ass nightmares...

1112
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,059
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1113
01:25:19,146 --> 01:25:21,685
You don't know, girl.
You really don't know.

1114
01:25:24,781 --> 01:25:27,488
- Don't you fuckin' walk away from...
- You better get the fuck off of me!

1115
01:25:27,619 --> 01:25:30,539
- Don't walk away from me, Anthony.
- Let me go.

1116
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,952
- Don't you... What about Sarah?
- I'll fuckin' kill you, girl!

1117
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:36,590
Don't you ever run up on me! Ever!
Ever run up on me again!

1118
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,423
I'll fuckin' kill you, Juanita!
Get the fuck off me!

1119
01:25:40,518 --> 01:25:42,427
Bunch of shit!

1120
01:26:01,178 --> 01:26:03,671
- Yeah!
- That's right. You can't trust them!

1121
01:26:07,356 --> 01:26:11,227
- Now, they send our men
off to Vietnam... - That's what they do.

1122
01:26:11,363 --> 01:26:14,782
to fight for this
so-called democracy.

1123
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,327
- That's right. Preach, sister.
- Yeah! Yeah!

1124
01:26:17,457 --> 01:26:19,452
But when they get back down
to the South Bronx...

1125
01:26:19,544 --> 01:26:22,714
and to Bed-Stuy and Harlem
and Watts, etc., etc...

1126
01:26:22,841 --> 01:26:25,548
shit is worse than ever.

1127
01:26:29,228 --> 01:26:32,931
- There is something
very sick about that. - He's a devil.

1128
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:34,896
That's right,
he's the devil.

1129
01:26:37,075 --> 01:26:39,235
That's right!

1130
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:45,288
Go, sister! Go on!

1131
01:26:45,423 --> 01:26:48,046
- Power to the people!
- Power to the people!

1132
01:26:50,098 --> 01:26:53,304
- In 'n' out.
- Never, never gonna give you up

1133
01:26:53,437 --> 01:26:56,061
I'm never, ever gonna stop

1134
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:58,560
Not the way
I feel about you

1135
01:26:58,696 --> 01:27:01,819
- Girl, I just can't live without you
- There you go.

1136
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:04,278
- I'm never, ever gonna quit
- What can I get you, baby?

1137
01:27:04,414 --> 01:27:06,788
Anyway, so like I was sayin',
I ran into this brother...

1138
01:27:06,919 --> 01:27:08,877
and he, uh, gave me
this flyer.

1139
01:27:08,965 --> 01:27:11,208
So I figured I'd go over
and check it out.

1140
01:27:11,302 --> 01:27:16,513
And there you were, up there
talkin' that ol' righteous shit.

1141
01:27:16,644 --> 01:27:20,811
I'm just a college student
tryin' to do her part to rally the people together.

1142
01:27:20,943 --> 01:27:25,277
But, dig, we need more
than talk. It's... It's time to do.

1143
01:27:25,369 --> 01:27:27,944
- Do what?
- Revolution.

1144
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:31,127
Oh, wait a minute. See.
Y'all a little outta my league now.

1145
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:33,373
Is that what you're gonna say
when the revolution comes?

1146
01:27:33,508 --> 01:27:36,464
W-When it's time
to pick up a gun?

1147
01:27:36,555 --> 01:27:38,466
What you know
about weapons?

1148
01:27:40,436 --> 01:27:42,513
I'm qualified
to handle a.45...

1149
01:27:42,648 --> 01:27:45,818
an M-16 rifle,
a.38-calibre pistol...

1150
01:27:45,946 --> 01:27:47,987
and a Russian AK-47.

1151
01:27:48,075 --> 01:27:51,328
An AK-47?

1152
01:27:55,421 --> 01:27:57,416
Why don't you join us?

1153
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:00,339
A lot of brothers
from the war have.

1154
01:28:00,472 --> 01:28:03,559
Baby, I got enough
heavy shit to deal with.

1155
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:13,319
- I got you, brother.
- Relax.

1156
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:18,535
You're so uptight.

1157
01:28:18,671 --> 01:28:21,794
Damn, I got to make
some fuckin' bread.

1158
01:28:21,926 --> 01:28:24,845
I'm through
with your sister, but...

1159
01:28:24,931 --> 01:28:28,552
I still got to take care
of my baby girl, Sarah.

1160
01:28:28,688 --> 01:28:31,645
Shit, and the one
that's on the way.

1161
01:28:31,777 --> 01:28:34,270
Damn!

1162
01:28:34,406 --> 01:28:38,739
Look, anyway, uh, I got
this plan to make some money.

1163
01:28:38,873 --> 01:28:41,412
I want you to keep
this shit to yourself.

1164
01:28:43,715 --> 01:28:46,837
At 6:15 a.m., the truck
pulls outta the post office...

1165
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:50,223
at 149th and Grand Concourse.

1166
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:53,563
Now, it makes one stop
before it goes to D. C...

1167
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:57,816
which is a mail drop-off
at First Federal Loan and Savings...

1168
01:28:57,949 --> 01:29:00,905
which is on Noble Street
and West.

1169
01:29:00,994 --> 01:29:02,905
Now, Kirby...

1170
01:29:02,998 --> 01:29:04,992
you're gonna position yourself
in a getaway car...

1171
01:29:05,127 --> 01:29:08,463
at the end of the corner,
where you can see everything.

1172
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:12,800
Jose. Me and you gonna
position ourselves behind the bank...

1173
01:29:12,891 --> 01:29:17,556
underneath the left
and the right side of the loadin' dock.

1174
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:21,858
Delilah, you're gonna position
yourself inside the Dumpster...

1175
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:25,077
which is located directly across
from the loadin' dock.

1176
01:29:28,085 --> 01:29:30,708
Now, Skippy, I want you
to position yourself...

1177
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:34,046
approximately ten feet
from the alleyway.

1178
01:29:34,179 --> 01:29:37,633
There, you post
a lookout.

1179
01:29:37,728 --> 01:29:39,637
We all know what to do
at the point of attack...

1180
01:29:39,729 --> 01:29:42,603
because we've gone
over that shit enough.

1181
01:29:42,735 --> 01:29:47,400
If anybody gets caught, you shut
the fuck up, and we'll keep your money.

1182
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:50,076
Shh! Fuck that shit, man.

1183
01:29:50,207 --> 01:29:52,664
I'm telling you right now,
if I get caught...

1184
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:57,463
- I'm shooting my fuckin' way out.
- Nigger, put that shit down.

1185
01:29:57,594 --> 01:30:00,432
I think we need another man
on the street with Skip.

1186
01:30:00,559 --> 01:30:02,387
Someone to cover
the other side.

1187
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:05,435
- I agree.
- Oh, man! Hell, no!

1188
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,561
We don't need no 'nother man.
Shit, I can see.

1189
01:30:07,654 --> 01:30:11,073
- Besides, we got too many
motherfuckers anyway. - Fuck that shit, Kirby, man.

1190
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:14,248
Everybody trusts
everybody here, right?

1191
01:30:17,672 --> 01:30:19,797
I can get somebody
from our organization.

1192
01:30:19,925 --> 01:30:24,057
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't want none of them revolutionary niggers involved.

1193
01:30:24,142 --> 01:30:26,599
You can cut your eye at me
all you want to.

1194
01:30:26,729 --> 01:30:28,937
I ain't too keen on havin'
that broad up in here neither.

1195
01:30:29,067 --> 01:30:32,521
Well, you the one talkin' about
we need another man. Make up your goddam mind.

1196
01:30:32,657 --> 01:30:35,494
You have somebody in mind,
Anthony?

1197
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:39,288
We might as well put
a motherfuckin' ad in the paper. Then we gonna get everybody.

1198
01:30:39,418 --> 01:30:42,208
Shit, ain't gonna be
no money left for a nigger.

1199
01:30:46,097 --> 01:30:50,050
Oh, yes! Y'all didn't know
your reverend was a gamblin' man?

1200
01:30:50,188 --> 01:30:54,320
A sinnin' man?

1201
01:30:54,404 --> 01:30:57,241
I was a man who maimed!

1202
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:01,245
I was a man who killed!

1203
01:31:03,461 --> 01:31:07,960
We all know it was done
in the name of the wicked one.

1204
01:31:08,052 --> 01:31:12,005
The one that was
cast down from heaven.

1205
01:31:12,142 --> 01:31:15,597
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

1206
01:31:15,732 --> 01:31:20,196
I said y'all know
who I'm talkin' about!

1207
01:31:20,325 --> 01:31:22,996
Can I get a "hallelujah"
in this house of God?

1208
01:31:23,079 --> 01:31:25,239
Hallelujah!

1209
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:26,954
Hallelujah!

1210
01:31:27,086 --> 01:31:30,541
Well, look here, man.
Skip is in. Period. All right?

1211
01:31:30,635 --> 01:31:34,386
I stand a lot to lose
if this thing blows up in my face.

1212
01:31:34,517 --> 01:31:37,555
The last time I saw him, he was
shooting poison in his veins.

1213
01:31:37,646 --> 01:31:40,685
Yeah, I know. Well, you know,
he's tryin' to shake that shit, man.

1214
01:31:40,777 --> 01:31:44,694
- He's still on drugs.
- And I still trust him with my life, Cleon.

1215
01:31:46,454 --> 01:31:49,955
Remember that last battle?

1216
01:31:50,084 --> 01:31:51,995
He froze up.

1217
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:55,715
For a minute.
Then h-he broke out of it.

1218
01:31:55,803 --> 01:32:00,433
And when he "broke out of it,"
Dugan was dead.

1219
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,764
Come on, Cleon. You know that
could've happened to any of us.

1220
01:32:02,858 --> 01:32:06,609
Now either you in
or you out. Which one?

1221
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:09,280
How much money did you say
was in that truck?

1222
01:34:32,246 --> 01:34:34,204
We still got
about 15 minutes.

1223
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:36,700
I tell ya, I could've
used another cup of coffee.

1224
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:38,712
Let's make this quick.

1225
01:34:45,937 --> 01:34:47,812
Bank security.

1226
01:34:53,826 --> 01:34:55,737
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

1227
01:34:55,829 --> 01:34:57,740
- Mornin'.
- Good mornin'.

1228
01:35:33,897 --> 01:35:36,105
Oh, f...

1229
01:35:50,384 --> 01:35:53,172
You waitin' on
the number 11 bus?

1230
01:35:53,305 --> 01:35:55,216
Yes.

1231
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:58,354
I don't think
she runs this early.

1232
01:35:58,481 --> 01:36:03,028
I caught it the other morning,
uh, at this same time.

1233
01:36:03,156 --> 01:36:04,533
You sure about that?

1234
01:36:05,912 --> 01:36:07,821
Uh-huh.

1235
01:36:07,915 --> 01:36:11,203
- Let me check for you.
- No need to go to any trouble, Officer.

1236
01:36:11,337 --> 01:36:13,213
No, no, no.
No trouble at all, brother.

1237
01:36:16,262 --> 01:36:18,870
I see by that patch
on your jacket you were in recon.

1238
01:36:18,871 --> 01:36:23,086
I was a 5th marine. Always willin'
to help out a fellow leatherneck.

1239
01:36:28,472 --> 01:36:30,383
Brown on patrol.
Brown on patrol.

1240
01:36:30,476 --> 01:36:33,930
Requesting off-hour route check
on number 11.

1241
01:36:34,024 --> 01:36:36,599
Dispatch to Brown.
Hold for schedule.

1242
01:36:36,695 --> 01:36:38,606
That's a copy.

1243
01:36:38,699 --> 01:36:40,907
Do somethin', Cleon.

1244
01:37:16,682 --> 01:37:19,686
- Ambush! Ambush!
- Drop it, motherfucker!

1245
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:57,784
What the hell?

1246
01:38:00,134 --> 01:38:01,927
Shit!

1247
01:38:34,737 --> 01:38:37,823
Joe! Come on. Let's move.

1248
01:38:48,052 --> 01:38:50,759
Oh, goddam it!

1249
01:39:31,544 --> 01:39:34,382
Fuck! Shit!

1250
01:39:40,853 --> 01:39:43,476
Oh, shit!

1251
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:47,110
Anthony!

1252
01:40:20,757 --> 01:40:24,045
- Did you see that shit, man?
- Hey, what the fuck wrong with you?

1253
01:40:24,179 --> 01:40:26,553
- See the way the fuckin' doors
blew off, man? - No, motherfucker!

1254
01:40:26,642 --> 01:40:29,016
Motherfuckin' Joe, you blew
the whole motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

1255
01:40:29,105 --> 01:40:31,645
- It blew up like that, man!
- That's how you fucked your hand up last time!

1256
01:40:31,776 --> 01:40:34,269
You... And the money... You fucked up.
I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass!

1257
01:40:34,406 --> 01:40:36,899
Grab what you can, motherfucker,
before the whole thing burns!

1258
01:40:36,994 --> 01:40:39,072
Hey, Anthony and Delilah
gotta see this shit, man.

1259
01:40:39,206 --> 01:40:41,414
I'm gonna go get 'em!
Hey, Anthony!

1260
01:40:43,297 --> 01:40:47,001
You gotta see the shit I did, man.
I blew that shit up, man!

1261
01:40:47,137 --> 01:40:50,591
You gotta see it, man!
You gotta see the shit I did!

1262
01:40:52,855 --> 01:40:55,430
Let's get outta here.
Put the gun down. Put the gun down.

1263
01:40:55,568 --> 01:40:57,479
Come on, Delilah.
Let's get up. Up. Let's go.

1264
01:40:59,659 --> 01:41:02,495
Come on, bro.

1265
01:41:02,622 --> 01:41:05,542
We gotta go, man.

1266
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:08,791
I can't...
I can't leave her.

1267
01:41:08,884 --> 01:41:11,803
You ain't gotta
leave her, bro...

1268
01:41:11,889 --> 01:41:14,381
'cause she's already gone.

1269
01:41:18,609 --> 01:41:20,152
Get up here!
Go on!

1270
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:22,552
Unit 1004, do you copy?

1271
01:42:22,638 --> 01:42:24,846
Please respond.

1272
01:42:24,975 --> 01:42:28,928
Do you require assistance?
Do you copy?

1273
01:42:29,024 --> 01:42:31,352
Any available units
in the vicinity of Noble Street.

1274
01:42:31,488 --> 01:42:33,815
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three. Repeat.

1275
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:35,991
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three.

1276
01:43:05,296 --> 01:43:08,170
God's not gonna
forgive me for this one.

1277
01:43:08,302 --> 01:43:12,469
I'll tell you what, Reverend.
With this kind of money, you can buy your way into heaven.

1278
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,983
That's where you're wrong, brother.

1279
01:43:17,068 --> 01:43:21,698
We done bought our way into hell.

1280
01:43:21,785 --> 01:43:25,868
The plain fact is that I promised
the Lord I would never sin like this.

1281
01:43:28,546 --> 01:43:31,918
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure
I even want any of this dirty money.

1282
01:43:33,429 --> 01:43:36,005
Well, I'll tell you what,
Reverend.

1283
01:43:36,101 --> 01:43:38,012
We'll find somethin'
to do with your share.

1284
01:43:38,105 --> 01:43:41,975
- Amen to that shit.
- No. No, no, no, no.

1285
01:43:42,112 --> 01:43:44,783
- I'll take the money.
- You lyin' sack o' shit.

1286
01:43:46,953 --> 01:43:50,123
I'm sure the Lord will find
another way for me to do my penance.

1287
01:43:51,963 --> 01:43:54,290
Just tell me
one thing, Cleon.

1288
01:43:54,425 --> 01:43:56,752
Why the fuck
you didn't grab the cop?

1289
01:43:56,846 --> 01:44:00,135
You killed him.
A young brother.

1290
01:44:00,269 --> 01:44:03,605
If you wouldn't have froze up like
a bitch, maybe I wouldn't have had to do that shit, now wouldn't I?

1291
01:44:03,691 --> 01:44:05,851
Would y'all
shut the fuck up?

1292
01:44:07,365 --> 01:44:10,653
Man, Delilah. Shit.

1293
01:44:10,787 --> 01:44:13,957
Man, radio said they got
Joe's stupid ass.

1294
01:44:14,085 --> 01:44:17,787
Fucked it up.
The whole plan was fucked up.

1295
01:44:20,596 --> 01:44:23,634
We ain't do shit right
out there, man. Shit.

1296
01:44:26,524 --> 01:44:30,607
Y'all make sure that Jose's share
goes to Marisol and his kids.

1297
01:44:30,698 --> 01:44:32,739
- Walk on by
- Done.

1298
01:44:39,087 --> 01:44:42,210
Your junkie ass really
messed up out there.

1299
01:44:42,344 --> 01:44:44,004
Don't blame me
for your fuck-ups.

1300
01:44:44,097 --> 01:44:49,557
I told Anthony I didn't want nothin' to
do with a crazy, devil-filled junkie!

1301
01:44:49,688 --> 01:44:52,443
- What?
- You listenin' to me? Look at him.

1302
01:44:53,821 --> 01:44:56,825
- Oh, shit!
- Now say some more shit!

1303
01:44:56,910 --> 01:44:58,821
I'll knock your ass
right back down.

1304
01:44:58,914 --> 01:45:01,667
Fake-ass wanna-be preacher,
no-members-havin' motherfucker!

1305
01:45:01,752 --> 01:45:05,753
Why don't y'all stop actin'
like some fuckin' clowns?

1306
01:45:05,884 --> 01:45:08,841
You know, you niggers
sure is silly.

1307
01:45:08,932 --> 01:45:12,600
Now, you're standin' here fightin',
and we got over $300,000...

1308
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:16,018
of cold, hard, unmarked U.S. cash
to split up five ways.

1309
01:45:16,111 --> 01:45:19,565
Let me tell ya somethin'.
You make me lose count again, I'm gonna shoot me a motherfucker...

1310
01:45:19,701 --> 01:45:21,742
and then we gonna be splittin'
this thing up four ways, hear?

1311
01:45:25,044 --> 01:45:29,175
Man, I can't believe this.
They was gonna burn all this shit.

1312
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,256
All this shit, and a nigger
can't even find a job.

1313
01:45:33,850 --> 01:45:37,803
Well, that's Uncle Sam
for you, baby.

1314
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:39,816
Money to burn.

1315
01:45:42,449 --> 01:45:45,452
Police have issued an all-points
bulletin for the remaining...

1316
01:45:45,538 --> 01:45:47,448
...Reserve Bank
on Noble Street.

1317
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:49,037
Faces painted skeleton white.

1318
01:45:49,169 --> 01:45:51,923
Cobra, request your status.
Over.

1319
01:45:52,007 --> 01:45:53,883
- Five federal security guards...
- Anthony!

1320
01:45:54,011 --> 01:45:56,765
- She's already gone.
- Do it. Kill me.

1321
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,511
The bloody shootout erupted...
an armoured truck... explosives...

1322
01:45:58,645 --> 01:46:02,347
No, motherfuckin' Joe.
You blew the whole motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

1323
01:46:02,484 --> 01:46:03,814
...the deaths of nine people.

1324
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:07,489
The heroin ain't never
did nothin' to me.

1325
01:46:07,576 --> 01:46:09,950
...just moments away from the scene
of the crime... Robbery turned bloody...

1326
01:46:10,038 --> 01:46:13,541
- Had some shit got
into me over there, man. - Crushed to death by...

1327
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:16,757
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

1328
01:46:16,885 --> 01:46:20,006
Had a very shiny nose

1329
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:22,099
- And if you ever saw it
- What you slowin' down for?

1330
01:46:22,227 --> 01:46:23,426
- Be cool. Be cool.
- What you doin'?

1331
01:46:23,563 --> 01:46:27,101
- Come on. Come on.
- What the fuck, man? Aw, shit!

1332
01:46:27,236 --> 01:46:30,940
- All of the other reindeer
- What the fuck we doin' over here?

1333
01:46:31,077 --> 01:46:33,652
- Say, man, check out all these kids.
- Man!

1334
01:46:33,748 --> 01:46:35,623
Hey, let's go to the liquor store
and go to the club.

1335
01:46:35,751 --> 01:46:38,505
Look, man, I'm gonna take care of you.
We're gonna go down to the club.

1336
01:46:38,589 --> 01:46:40,667
- We don't know them motherfuckers!
- That's the whole point, baby.

1337
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:43,135
Come on. Get in the spirit.
Hey, y'all come on over here!

1338
01:46:43,265 --> 01:46:46,387
- Nigger, we gonna get robbed.
- Hey, be cool, nigger. Y'all come on over here.

1339
01:46:46,478 --> 01:46:51,358
- Be cool, man. Damn.
- Rudolph, with your nose so bright

1340
01:46:51,445 --> 01:46:53,570
All of y'all gonna get some.
All right. All right.

1341
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,568
- Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
- What, motherfu...

1342
01:46:55,661 --> 01:46:57,821
Yeah, man. Merry Christmas,
motherfucker. Go on. Leave me alone.

1343
01:46:57,957 --> 01:47:01,744
Say, say, Skippy. Hey, man,
why don't you bring your ass over here and quit that jivin'.

1344
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:04,836
Come on. Yeah, yeah. Y'all take
all the toys. All right. Get one.

1345
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:07,545
- See what I'm sayin'?
I ain't kiddin'. We givin' it away. - All right. All right. Yeah.

1346
01:47:07,641 --> 01:47:10,597
That's why Santa Claus don't wanna
come 'round here 'cause he's scared he's gonna get shot or robbed.

1347
01:47:10,729 --> 01:47:15,692
All right. Just one. Hey, hey, hey.
Give me this, man. Get a... Get a... Get a toy.

1348
01:47:15,822 --> 01:47:17,863
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Why you stealin'? You ain't gotta steal.

1349
01:47:17,993 --> 01:47:20,283
- All right, all right, all right.
- Funky little brothers. I talked to him.

1350
01:47:20,372 --> 01:47:23,126
He says he ain't never gonna come down
here unless he's got police protection.

1351
01:47:23,211 --> 01:47:26,000
Last year, one of y'all niggers
stole one of his reindeer.

1352
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:37,651
No, no. I say let's just go up there
and kill that motherfucker.

1353
01:47:39,405 --> 01:47:42,907
Man, me and Anthony gave out
a couple of things, but that was it.

1354
01:47:43,036 --> 01:47:46,989
You gave toys and turkeys to people.
Then you got the hell outta Dodge.

1355
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:51,508
Man. Y'all sayin' my man is
goin' around handin' out $100 bills...

1356
01:47:51,594 --> 01:47:54,003
and sayin' that
God Almighty gave it to him?

1357
01:47:54,098 --> 01:47:57,849
My cousin lives up there
in Mount Vernon. He says that Cleon's up there actin' a goddam fool.

1358
01:47:57,938 --> 01:48:00,098
That ol' high-profile ass
nigger.

1359
01:48:00,234 --> 01:48:02,109
Bought a brand-new Caddy.

1360
01:48:02,237 --> 01:48:03,947
Folk know he can't afford it.

1361
01:48:04,074 --> 01:48:07,695
- Look, man, I'm gonna go
over there and talk to him. - No, no, no. Fuck the talk!

1362
01:48:07,788 --> 01:48:10,707
I'm drivin' up there, and I'm gonna
take him out before he rats us out.

1363
01:48:10,793 --> 01:48:13,713
Look, Kirby.
I'm gonna handle everything, all right?

1364
01:48:13,841 --> 01:48:17,544
- I'm gonna straighten this shit out.
- All right.

1365
01:48:17,681 --> 01:48:21,218
But if you don't take care of this,
Anthony, I promise you, I will.

1366
01:48:21,313 --> 01:48:23,521
I told you we didn't
need another man.

1367
01:48:23,608 --> 01:48:26,528
That's y'all's motherfuckin'
punk-ass friend!

1368
01:48:26,613 --> 01:48:30,067
People runnin' from their worries

1369
01:48:30,203 --> 01:48:32,493
While the judge and his juries

1370
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:37,462
They take the law
that's part of the flaw

1371
01:48:37,592 --> 01:48:41,593
No. Oh, shit, Cleon!

1372
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:43,760
Love, fallin', fussin' and a-cussin'

1373
01:48:43,853 --> 01:48:45,432
Damn!

1374
01:48:46,606 --> 01:48:48,897
The feelin' now is killin'

1375
01:48:50,447 --> 01:48:52,773
For peace no one is willin'

1376
01:48:54,162 --> 01:48:56,239
Kinda make you get that feelin'

1377
01:48:58,878 --> 01:49:00,789
Everybody's startin'

1378
01:49:02,385 --> 01:49:04,712
Use the pill and the dope

1379
01:49:06,684 --> 01:49:08,844
Educated fools

1380
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:12,564
From uneducated schools

1381
01:49:16,535 --> 01:49:20,370
Right now we'd like to bring on
a young man who believes in doing things his own way.

1382
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,789
And based on the way he kinda
get next to all of the folks who've seen him work...

1383
01:49:23,882 --> 01:49:25,460
his way has gotta be
pretty hip.

1384
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:29,467
So let's lay some noise
on the mighty Al Green.

1385
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:38,612
Apartment 13!

1386
01:49:39,784 --> 01:49:41,862
I'm so tired of bein' alone

1387
01:49:41,996 --> 01:49:44,370
I'm so tied up on my own

1388
01:49:44,459 --> 01:49:46,833
Won't you help me, girl

1389
01:49:46,921 --> 01:49:51,385
Just as soon as you can

1390
01:49:56,898 --> 01:49:59,106
Don't move, mister!

1391
01:49:59,235 --> 01:50:02,773
I been wantin' to get
next to you, baby

1392
01:50:02,908 --> 01:50:04,819
You see, sometime
I fold my arms, I say

1393
01:50:04,953 --> 01:50:08,455
- Ooo-ooo
- Mmm-hmm-mmm

1394
01:50:08,584 --> 01:50:11,077
Whoa-oh-oh

1395
01:50:11,214 --> 01:50:13,789
Oh, baby, hey

1396
01:50:15,304 --> 01:50:19,091
Needing you has proven to be

1397
01:50:19,186 --> 01:50:22,724
To be my greatest dream
Yeah

1398
01:50:22,818 --> 01:50:26,272
- I'm so tired of being alone
- Oh, tired, baby

1399
01:50:28,579 --> 01:50:30,905
- Here's the rest of the fifties.
- Put it in there.

1400
01:50:33,253 --> 01:50:37,088
You know, I still feel fucked-up
about this whole situation.

1401
01:50:37,177 --> 01:50:41,308
Look, feelin' fucked-up
don't help a goddam thing and it ain't gonna bring nobody back.

1402
01:50:41,434 --> 01:50:45,103
- Shit!
- So, just worry about yourself. We just gotta get outta here.

1403
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:49,571
- Come on.
- Say, man, you got everything?

1404
01:50:49,698 --> 01:50:51,657
Yeah, grab that bag.

1405
01:50:53,956 --> 01:50:56,414
This is a bitch.

1406
01:50:56,544 --> 01:50:59,915
This is it, man.
This is it.

1407
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:02,009
All we got to do, boy,
is make it to Mexico.

1408
01:51:02,137 --> 01:51:04,678
We'll be fine.
We'll get us a villa, see?

1409
01:51:04,809 --> 01:51:07,480
And then, and buy a boat
and sail all around the gulf.

1410
01:51:07,564 --> 01:51:10,567
Everything will be fine.
We just gotta get the fuck outta here.

1411
01:51:10,695 --> 01:51:12,938
Yeah, maybe I can send
for Sarah once we get down there.

1412
01:51:13,074 --> 01:51:16,029
Well, anything's possible.
Come on.

1413
01:51:16,162 --> 01:51:18,656
Wait a minute.
Run, Anthony! Hyah!

1414
01:51:18,751 --> 01:51:22,204
Y'all get back!
Get away right there! Get off me!

1415
01:51:23,883 --> 01:51:26,342
Shit!

1416
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:30,050
- You pity fool, you pity fool
- Fuck!

1417
01:51:30,144 --> 01:51:33,101
You better have some sympathy

1418
01:51:33,234 --> 01:51:38,148
Yeah
'Cause there's educated people

1419
01:51:38,284 --> 01:51:41,987
Runnin' the lives of our society

1420
01:51:44,003 --> 01:51:45,629
Makin' up the rules

1421
01:51:47,418 --> 01:51:51,465
Mr Curtis, you have been
lawfully tried in this court...

1422
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:53,878
and found guilty on all charges.

1423
01:51:53,972 --> 01:51:57,758
Do you have anything to say on your own
behalf before I pronounce sentence?

1424
01:51:57,895 --> 01:51:59,556
Uh...

1425
01:51:59,648 --> 01:52:02,735
no, ain't nothin' I say
gonna get me out of this.

1426
01:52:04,281 --> 01:52:07,782
But things were gettin' bad
for me, and...

1427
01:52:07,912 --> 01:52:10,488
I had to do what I had to do
to s... to survive.

1428
01:52:13,797 --> 01:52:15,791
Maybe it was wrong, but l...

1429
01:52:15,927 --> 01:52:18,598
I certainly didn't mean
for anybody to be hurt.

1430
01:52:18,681 --> 01:52:21,221
Uh, Your Honour,
please consider before sentencing...

1431
01:52:21,352 --> 01:52:24,309
that my client served his country proud
in the Marine Corps.

1432
01:52:24,442 --> 01:52:26,769
As a matter of fact, he was
a member of an elite unit...

1433
01:52:26,862 --> 01:52:28,940
a sergeant,
decorated with many medals.

1434
01:52:29,033 --> 01:52:33,164
In fact, one of those medals
was the, uh, Silver Star, for valour.

1435
01:52:33,249 --> 01:52:36,003
I realize that my client had
a difficult time adjusting when he...

1436
01:52:36,088 --> 01:52:38,877
Excuse me, Counsel.
l, too, was a marine...

1437
01:52:38,967 --> 01:52:42,755
and I served my country proudly
in World War Il, a real war, I may add.

1438
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:44,765
- Yes, Your Honor...
- I'm not finished yet, please.

1439
01:52:44,894 --> 01:52:48,266
I received the Purple Heart
at Guadalcanal.

1440
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,893
Now, this young man has obviously
forgotten some very...

1441
01:52:50,988 --> 01:52:55,285
fundamental things like decency
and dedication and honor...

1442
01:52:55,412 --> 01:52:57,122
everything the corps taught us.

1443
01:52:57,249 --> 01:52:59,824
He is a disgrace to everyone
that has ever put on that uniform...

1444
01:52:59,962 --> 01:53:05,257
and I will not permit you or him to use
the Vietnam War as a cop-out here.

1445
01:53:07,017 --> 01:53:10,305
Anthony Curtis, for your
participation in this crime...

1446
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:14,107
a crime that took the lives of several
innocent people, I do hereby...

1447
01:53:14,197 --> 01:53:17,449
sentence you to the custody of the
Attorney General of the United States...

1448
01:53:17,535 --> 01:53:19,993
for a period of 15 years to life.

1449
01:53:20,123 --> 01:53:22,795
Oh, my God.

1450
01:53:22,877 --> 01:53:26,961
These proceedings are concluded.
This court is adjourned.

1451
01:53:27,052 --> 01:53:30,388
"Life"? What the fuck
he mean "life"?

1452
01:53:30,475 --> 01:53:32,967
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

1453
01:53:33,062 --> 01:53:36,351
What the fuck he talkin' about, "life"?
Man, fuck you! Fuck you!

1454
01:53:36,485 --> 01:53:38,396
- Hey!
- Oh, Anthony!

1455
01:53:38,531 --> 01:53:40,655
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

1456
01:53:40,743 --> 01:53:42,571
You, remove the prisoner
from the court!

1457
01:53:42,738 --> 01:53:45,824
- You hear me?
- Fuck you! Fuck you! - Restrain the prisoner!

1458
01:53:45,876 --> 01:53:49,213
Get him outta here! Let the record
show... Let the record show...

1459
01:53:49,341 --> 01:53:51,217
that a chair was thrown
at the judge.

1460
01:53:58,148 --> 01:54:00,024
Whoa, whoa

1461
01:54:06,497 --> 01:54:10,748
If you see me
walkin' down the street

1462
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,752
And I start to cry

1463
01:54:13,843 --> 01:54:16,336
Each time we meet

1464
01:54:19,979 --> 01:54:21,938
Then walk on by

1465
01:54:25,614 --> 01:54:28,570
Walk on by

1466
01:54:30,832 --> 01:54:33,242
Make believe

1467
01:54:33,337 --> 01:54:37,005
That you don't see the tears

1468
01:54:38,303 --> 01:54:41,093
You just let me grieve
in private

1469
01:54:41,184 --> 01:54:44,472
'Cause each time I see you

1470
01:54:44,565 --> 01:54:49,361
I just can't help myself
I think about how tight we used to be

1471
01:54:49,491 --> 01:54:53,823
I break down and cry

1472
01:54:53,915 --> 01:54:55,956
Oh, baby

1473
01:54:56,044 --> 01:54:58,750
Walk on by

1474
01:55:08,482 --> 01:55:11,570
Hmm-mmm-mmm

1475
01:55:17,499 --> 01:55:22,081
I just can't get over
losing you

1476
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:25,837
So if I seem

1477
01:55:25,931 --> 01:55:28,554
Broken in two

1478
01:55:31,065 --> 01:55:34,768
Please walk on by

1479
01:55:36,324 --> 01:55:38,947
Walk on by

1480
01:55:41,375 --> 01:55:43,915
Foolish pride

1481
01:55:44,046 --> 01:55:47,335
Is all that I have left

1482
01:55:47,469 --> 01:55:50,425
So let me hide

1483
01:55:50,516 --> 01:55:55,182
The tears and the sadness
you gave me

1484
01:55:55,317 --> 01:55:57,192
You put the hurt on me

1485
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:59,196
You socked it to me, mama

1486
01:55:59,324 --> 01:56:04,203
When you said goodbye

1487
01:56:05,794 --> 01:56:09,248
So, please, walk on by

1488
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:14,638
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1489
01:56:17,398 --> 01:56:19,309
So do me a favour

1490
01:56:19,443 --> 01:56:22,945
And walk on by

1491
01:56:24,702 --> 01:56:26,613
So I'm beggin' you to

1492
01:56:26,706 --> 01:56:29,330
Walk on by

1493
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:31,163
Oh, yeah

1494
01:56:31,298 --> 01:56:34,217
And make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1495
01:56:36,223 --> 01:56:38,264
So I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you

1496
01:56:38,393 --> 01:56:40,684
To walk on by

1497
01:56:43,277 --> 01:56:46,565
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1498
01:56:49,539 --> 01:56:51,414
Oh

1499
01:56:51,542 --> 01:56:53,869
There's no dust in my eye

1500
01:56:54,005 --> 01:56:55,999
Oh, no

1501
01:56:57,887 --> 01:56:59,762
Smoke ain't makin' me cry

1502
01:56:59,891 --> 01:57:02,562
No, no, no

1503
01:57:02,687 --> 01:57:05,726
It's the hurt
you put on me, yeah

1504
01:57:07,738 --> 01:57:10,575
I don't want you
to see this man cry

1505
01:57:12,663 --> 01:57:14,907
Where is the love

1506
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,493
Where is the love

1507
01:57:17,631 --> 01:57:20,040
Where is the love

1508
01:57:20,135 --> 01:57:22,592
Where is the love

1509
01:57:22,681 --> 01:57:25,221
Where is the love

1510
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:27,602
Where is the love

1511
01:57:27,732 --> 01:57:29,976
Where is the love

1512
01:57:30,111 --> 01:57:32,438
Ooh, yeah, yeah

1513
01:57:32,574 --> 01:57:35,446
Where is the love

1514
01:57:35,537 --> 01:57:38,161
You said you'd give to me

1515
01:57:38,292 --> 01:57:40,785
Soon as you were free

1516
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,177
Will it ever be

1517
01:57:45,304 --> 01:57:50,304
Where is the love

1518
01:57:52,026 --> 01:57:56,821
You told me that you
didn't love him

1519
01:57:56,909 --> 01:58:01,824
And you were gonna say goodbye

1520
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,005
But if you really
didn't mean it

1521
01:58:07,094 --> 01:58:12,852
Why did you have to lie

1522
01:58:12,937 --> 01:58:15,858
Where is the love

1523
01:58:15,943 --> 01:58:18,697
You said was mine
all mine

1524
01:58:18,823 --> 01:58:21,363
Till the end of time

1525
01:58:21,452 --> 01:58:25,500
Was it just a lie

1526
01:58:25,585 --> 01:58:30,382
Where is the love

1527
01:58:32,306 --> 01:58:37,220
If you had had a sudden
change of heart

1528
01:58:37,314 --> 01:58:42,277
I wish that you
would tell me so

1529
01:58:42,407 --> 01:58:47,286
Don't leave me hangin'
on these promises

1530
01:58:47,416 --> 01:58:53,209
You've gotta let me know

1531
01:58:53,301 --> 01:58:55,876
Oh-ohh

1532
01:58:55,972 --> 01:58:58,549
Do-do do-do

1533
01:58:58,644 --> 01:59:01,018
Do-do do-do

1534
01:59:01,107 --> 01:59:05,856
Do-do do-do-do
