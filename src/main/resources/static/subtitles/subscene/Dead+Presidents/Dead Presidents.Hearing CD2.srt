Oh, he is not a pimp.

And besides, if you cared anything
about havin' a daughter,

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,035
you'd have wrote me back
after I sent you her picture.

for havin' a life.

with me.

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,872
Boy, boy. Mm-mm-mm.
Ant Junior.

171
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,077
See? It's the power
of the mind.

172
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,991
We will ourselves
a little boy.

173
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,712
Then can you will yourself
a better job?

174
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,719
Can you will yourself
to stop drinkin' so much?

175
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,110
Come on, Juanita. Don't even start
that shit, all right?

176
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,760
Thought we supposed to be
havin' a nice time here.

177
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,191
[Sighs]
Look, Juanita.

178
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,472
I'm gonna get myself
a good job.

179
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,632
You know how long you been singin'
that same old song now, Anthony?

180
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,116
I mean, in case you haven't noticed,
this here's the real world.

181
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,515
Ain't no free meals here
like in the marines.

182
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,677
Hey, let me
tell you somethin'.

183
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,791
Wasn't nothin' free
in the marines.

184
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,673
I earned every meal and every
fuckin' dollar, all right?

185
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,837
Look, everything's
gonna be cool.

186
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,589
You know I'll be
five months next week.

187
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,234
You're five months pregnant,
you can't be no nurse's aide.

188
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,510
I said we'll be all right.

189
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,751
Hey, um... [Clears Throat]
Anybody want some speed?

190
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,236
Get the fuck outta here
with that shit.

191
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,629
[Anthony] Why don't you cut
the bullshit, Joe?

192
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,915
Can't you clear your mind
for one sec, man?

193
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,634
Now, you sure that they
pick up cash money?

194
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,671
Hey, cash money, bro.

195
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,637
Like clockwork,
once a month.

196
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,315
Then they stop by the post
office before they make their
final run to Washington, man.

197
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,115
All the way to Washington, D.C.,
where they burn the money.
Can you believe that shit?

198
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,995
[Jose] Old bills, man.
Sometimes a couple million.

199
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,038
- How many guards?
- Four.

200
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,680
Two in the front and one
in the back carry revolvers.

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,270
The other one, [lmitates Gun Cocking]
12-gauge shotgun, man.

202
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,079
You think we can take 'em?

203
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,157
I can't say, man.

204
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,955
I mean, [Clears Throat]
four guards, and all of 'em packin'?

205
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,076
I put up the guns.

206
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,551
I get the money together
to get the plans goin'.
But you got to be the master planner.

207
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,108
[Jose] You got medals for blowin'
motherfuckers up out there.

208
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,550
- I heard you were like John Wayne.
- Well, then that's the deal.

209
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,875
Yeah,
all that money.

210
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,517
Ah, man.

211
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,835
Anthony. You down?

212
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,351
? The look?

213
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,353
- ? Of love?
- Let's drink on it anyway.

214
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,792
? Is in your eyes?

215
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,910
- ? A look?
- Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

216
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,911
- ? Your heart?
- Say, man...

217
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,395
- Shhh.
- ? Can't disguise??

218
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,031
Put the goddam thing away.
Get your little pyromaniac ass.

219
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,236
- You gonna be walkin' in a minute.
- Aw, cool out, Kirby, man.

220
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,511
I'm not gonna burn your car.
Not yet, at least. [Giggles]

221
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,790
Look, forget it, Juanita.

222
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,757
Come on.
Watch out there.

223
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,517
[Sighs]
What's the problem, Anthony?

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,470
What is it? I mean, is it
because I'm pregnant?

225
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,397
[Scoffs]
Come on. Now don't be silly.

226
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,476
So, then what's the problem?

227
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,077
Come on.
Talk to me. What is it?

228
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,997
[Thunderclap]

229
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,078
[Juanita Scoffs] I told you.
You need to leave that alcohol alone.

230
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,720
[Thunderclap]

231
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,395
[Body Parts Thudding]

232
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,511
[Growling]

233
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,438
[Growling]

234
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,154
- No! No!
- Anthony! Anthony, baby!

235
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,430
Come here. It's me.
It's me. It's all right.

236
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,357
- It's all right. Come here.
- [Panting]

237
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,314
Shh. Shh. Shh.
It's just another dream.

238
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,237
- It's just another dream.
- [Sobbing]

239
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,549
This is my best cut,
Mrs Stein. Enjoy.

240
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,910
Thank you
very much, Saul.

241
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,951
[Mrs Stein]
He's such a nice man.

242
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,877
[Man]
What did he give you?

243
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,797
- We need to talk.
- Oh. All right.

244
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,310
[Man, Mrs Stein
Chattering]

245
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,834
- So what's happenin'?
- You're a good man.

246
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,832
Aw, come on, Saul.
I ain't got time to kibitz with ya.

247
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,270
I got a whole lot
of meat to cut.

248
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,271
I'm closing down the shop.

249
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
Should've told you sooner,
but I thought maybe...

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,389
business, you know,
pick up a little.

251
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,677
Sorry.

252
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,754
- Here.
- Oh, no, look, Saul...

253
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,594
- No, I can't.
- What am I gonna do with it?
I have to get rid of it.

254
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,318
Come on.

255
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,631
? Now I know?

256
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,315
? We have great respect?

257
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,238
? For the sister
and mother?

258
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,157
? It's even better yet?

259
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,869
? But there's the joker
in the street?

260
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,428
Here you go, brother.
Don't let the bullshit get to you.

261
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,114
[Chuckles]
I'm tryin', man.

262
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,993
- I'm tryin'.
- You wanna get the man's
foot off your neck?

263
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,918
Come check us out.

264
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,560
Take care of yourself, brother.
Live righteous.

265
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,477
Here you go, brother.
Here you go.

266
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,149
Take care of yourself, brother.
Come see us now.

267
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,795
? Don't let us
hang around this town?

268
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,309
? And let what others say
come true??

269
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,231
Brothers and sisters,
here you go.

270
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,311
Heh, heh, heh, heh, hey.
Hey, youngblood.

271
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,309
[Chuckling]
Bringin' in the groceries, huh?

272
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,235
Lord, have mercy.

273
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,920
Man, I remember
when I was married.

274
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,032
I used to love to bring home
the groceries.

275
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,951
Made me feel real good.

276
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,032
Like a man.
Know what I mean?

277
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,716
[Chuckles]
Hey, listen, youngblood.

278
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,559
Uh, I just dropped by
to see Juanita and Sarah.

279
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,473
- You know, lay a little
somethin' on 'em.
- Stopped by to see my baby?

280
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,397
Is that right?

281
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,275
You know, youngblood, I took
care of your woman and your baby
when you were in the war.

282
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,755
Now, a man oughta get a little respect
for somethin' like that.

283
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,274
Now, I ain't
gonna lie to you.

284
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,636
I care about Juanita.
I care about her a whole lot.

285
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,508
But you back now,
and I'm gone.

286
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,195
So from this point on, you should
consider me like a friend of the family.

287
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,748
Find yourself in a jam and shit,
need a little cash,

288
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,751
you come see me,
I'll front you.

289
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,678
- Keep your shit.
- Listen, brother.

290
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,035
I know about pride.

291
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,037
But you got mouths to feed.

292
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,997
Now I laid a little cash
on Juanita.

293
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,997
Stay the fuck away
from my family.

294
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,514
What did you say?

295
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,915
You heard me, goddamn it.

296
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,031
I said, "Stay the fuck away
from my family."

297
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,751
See, I ain't the enemy,
youngblood.

298
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,551
I don't want no trouble.

299
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,436
Shit.

300
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,558
See, I tried to be
a friend, motherfucker.

301
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,552
Surprise, nigger.
[Chuckles]

302
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,398
Big bad marine.

303
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,391
Look at you now.

304
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,472
Does she suck you?
Fuck you?

305
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,114
Make you feel like a man?

306
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,037
Make you feel
real good?

307
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,115
Huh, boy?

308
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,518
Now, she wasn't doin' it
like that before you went
to the war, now was she?

309
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,234
[Chuckles] Now you gettin'
all that good lovin',

310
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,199
and you can't even put food
on your fuckin' table.

311
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,395
Come on, Santa Claus.
Open your mouth and suck this.

312
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,436
Come on. I got a present
for you. Suck it!

313
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,795
Suck it, nigger!

314
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,356
Kill me, motherfucker.
Shoot me right now.

315
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,317
What you gonna do,
shoot me?

316
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,431
You lucky
this is personal, nigger.

317
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,829
I ain't gonna kill you
over no woman.

318
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,797
Don't you ever...

319
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,751
in your fuckin' life...

320
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,428
bite the hand
that feeds you, nigger.

321
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,429
See ya, Santa Claus.

322
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,833
- [Sighs] I'm all right.
- Hold still.

323
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,474
- Hold still.
- No, I'm all right. Damn!

324
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,197
You givin' him
that money back.

325
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,754
He won't take it back.

326
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,913
What the fuck you talkin'...
You better give his shit back to him.

327
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,879
Even if I wanted to give it back to him,
he wouldn't take it back.

328
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,635
W-W-W-Wait. What the fuck you talkin'
about, "if you wanted to give it back"?

329
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,591
No, no, no, no.
Fuck that shit.

330
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,989
Have you forgotten
you just lost your damn job?

331
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,116
- We need that fuckin' money.
- We don't need his money.

332
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,077
Yeah, well, Anthony,
I'll tell you what.

333
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,953
You start bringin' some real
