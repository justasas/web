1
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,784
} Now, listen, Julie baby }

2
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:44,197
} It ain't natural for you
to cry in the midnight }

3
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:51,921
} It ain't natural
for you to cry }

4
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:56,758
} Way in the midnight through }

5
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,594
} Until the wee, small hours }

6
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:06,176
} Long 'fore the break
of dawn }

7
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,221
} Oh, Lord }

8
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:15,392
- } Mm-hmm }
-

9
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:21,983
The night started out with a bang.

10
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,784
A gunshot to the chest
on a drug deal gone bad.

11
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:29,034
All the elements were in place
for a long weekend...

12
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:32,169
heat, humidity, moonlight.

13
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:34,205
I was good at my job.

14
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,669
There were periods when my hands moved
with a speed and skill beyond me.

15
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:41,803
But in the last year, 
I started to lose that control.

16
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,256
Things had turned bad.

17
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:46,929
I hadn't saved anyone in months.

18
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:50,809
I just needed a few slow nights, 
followed by a couple of days off.

19
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,897
-  Ladder Four. 
- We're there.

20
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:57,817
Respond to a 10-22. 
Four-flight residential. 417 West 32.

21
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:01,113
77-David at 177 West 24.

22
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,077
There's a woman who says a roach
crawled in her ear. Can't get it out.

23
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,076
Says she's going
into cardiac arrest.

24
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:09,206
63-Boy, men's room, Grand Central. 
Man set his pants on fire.

25
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,658
- Bad burns. 
- Move back.
- Which apartment?

26
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:14,581
- 5-A.
- Oh, Jesus, it's Mr Burke.

27
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,622
Why is it always the top floor?

28
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,633
Goddam.

29
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:25,966
No! No!

30
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:33,683
No! No!

31
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:38,394
No! No!

32
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:43,862
Oh, God, they're here.

33
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:46,199
- Shh, shh. Over there.
-

34
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:48,866
Mary, it's two hands.
It's my dad.

35
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:51,702
We were just watching TV,
and he was sort of punching his chest...

36
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,870
- Step outside.
- Next thing,
he locks himself in the bathroom.

37
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:56,877
So I told him I was gonna
call you guys, and he said not to.

38
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,212
- How long ago did he stop breathing?
- I don't know. Ten minutes.

39
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:02,627
Twenty. A woman on the phone
tried to tell us how to do C. P. R.

40
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:05,050
- Could you do something?
- We'll do what we can.

41
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,802
He was cryin'. 
I never heard him cryin'before.

42
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:36,033
- 
- I need you to squeeze this
once every three seconds.

43
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:40,370
Clear! Clear!

44
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,880
-
-

45
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,417
- Ma'am, I need you to step back.
- Clear! Clear!

46
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:48,045
No more. Please don't.

47
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:51,017
- Clear! Clear!
- Ma'am, step back.

48
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:54,725
Daddy.

49
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:12,407
In the last year, 
I'd come to believe in such things...

50
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,952
as spirits leaving the body
and not wanting to be put back.

51
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:21,379
Spirits angry at the awkward places
death had left them.

52
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,085
I understood how crazy it was
to think this way.

53
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,470
But I was convinced
that if I turned around,

54
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,970
I'd see old man Burke...

55
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:34,674
standing at the window,

56
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:36,721
watching,

57
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:39,181
waiting for us to finish.

58
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:49,030
I'll take over.
Call E. R. And ask for an 83.

59
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:00,203
Sorry.

60
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:16,765
Do you have any music?

61
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:19,932
- What?
- Music.

62
00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:23,683
I think it helps if you play
something he liked.

63
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:27,611
John.

64
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,732
Play the Sinatra.

65
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,868
- What?
- Play the Sinatra.

66
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:35,118
What is it, Johnny?

67
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,960
} I'm a man }

68
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:45,207
} Who has always had }

69
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:49,469
- } The wandering ways }
-

70
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:51,801
} Now I'm reaching back }

71
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,050
- } For yesterday }}
-

72
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:58,220
- 
- Okay, Frank, you can call it. 83.

73
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:02,897
- No, we can't. He's got a pulse.
- No shit?

74
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:06,524
- Is he gonna be all right?
-

75
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:10,651
His heart's beating.
Have 'em bring up a board.

76
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:13,737
}}

77
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,540
No, no. No. No.

78
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:27,542
Help your family.
Ride with your mother and brother.

79
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:31,375
Help your family.
They need you more. Help yourself.

80
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,736
} Now, Julian, there ain't
nothin'on my mind }

81
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:51,811
- } More for the way than
what you're lookin'for }
-

82
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:58,454
- For the family.
- } And she done went and jumped at me }

83
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,364
} Lunged from behind the door }

84
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,707
} And looked into my eyes }

85
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:08,917
I had to concentrate
to keep my mind from wandering off... .

86
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:10,923
on these short trips.

87
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:13,423
It was the neighbourhood
I grew up in...

88
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:16,590
and where I'd worked most
as a paramedic.

89
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:21,053
And it held more ghosts
per square foot than any other.

90
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,439
} Your little
star-struck innuendos }

91
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,142
} Inadequacies and }

92
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,400
} Foreign bodies }

93
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:40,871
} And the sunlight shining
through the crack in the windowpane }

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,992
} Numbs my brain }}

95
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:48,828
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

96
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:52,333
Hey, partner. 
Your man doesn't look well. 
They not gonna appreciate you inside.

97
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,504
- Nobody loves me, Griss.
- Hey, Griss just tellin' you
things are backing up.

98
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:57,677
Griss, let us in.

99
00:08:57,806 --> 00:08:59,799
Whatever you say.

100
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,471
Oh, my foot!

101
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:05,936
Don't even slow down.
Just keep on moving.

102
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:10,193
Sir, you say you've been snorting
cocaine for three days...

103
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,273
and now you feel as if your heart
is beating too fast...

104
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:15,197
and you would like
for us to help you.

105
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:18,325
To tell you the truth,
I don't see why we should.

106
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:21,025
Correct me if I am wrong here,
if I'm mistaken.

107
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,701
Did we sell you the cocaine?
Did we push it up your nose?

108
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:27,248
- Oh, come on.
- For Christ sakes,
can I please get a cup of water?

109
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:30,793
- Shut up, goddam civilian!
- All I want is a cup of water!

110
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:33,129
Oh, no. No, no, 
no, no, no, guys.

111
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:36,462
We're on diversion here.
We're not accepting any more patients.

112
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:39,798
The dispatcher should've let you
know that, Frank. I cannot do it. No.

113
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:41,723
We picked him up at 49th and 10th.
You're the closest.

114
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,724
Where do you want me to put him?
You tell me.

115
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:46,937
He wanted to come here. He said that
the nurses at Misery were the best.

116
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:51,525
- All I want is a cup of water!
- All right, fine.
I'll kick someone out of bed three.

117
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:54,404
Excuse me.
You're a kind man, I can see that.

118
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,614
A man like you's not gonna deny a poor,
sick, dying, helpless man...

119
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:00,576
- a small cup of water.
- I can't.
I have to stay with my patient.

120
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:02,909
Will you shut the fuck up?

121
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:07,451
Goddam it. What the hell are you doing
to me? We're all backed up in here.

122
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:10,918
Jesus Christ, look at this guy.
Looks like he needs the works.
What's wrong with him?

123
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:14,415
- You should know. You pronounced him.
- You told me he was dead.

124
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,423
- Flatline.
- He got better.

125
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,710
I hate pronouncing
people dead over the phone.

126
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:23,093
Yeah. Better, huh? They're fixed
and dilated. This guy's plant food.

127
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:26,808
Hey, we stole a stretcher from X ray, so
put him in three next to the overdose.

128
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:29,689
All right, look. He's our lowest
priority now. He shouldn't even be here.

129
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:32,057
All this technology. 
What a waste.

130
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,897
Leave that dope alone. 
The doc'll be out in a minute.

131
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,733
- Sir, is there some way we could
find out what's going on?
- Please, folks, step back.

132
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:41,862
Please, folks, step back.
I've already told you two to step back.

133
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:44,948
- Mister...
- Now, look, don't make me
take off my sunglasses.

134
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,208
First-time heart attack, age 45. He
should've gone to C. C. U. Ten hours ago.

135
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:51,541
We got three bodies up there
just like the one you brought in.

136
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,039
Over there, two AIDS patients.
One is 12 and filling up with fluids.

137
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:57,131
Mother won't sign
the "Do Not Resuscitate. "

138
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:59,964
Mercy killing doesn't
translate well in Spanish.

139
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:02,551
It's a sin
to have to tube that kid.

140
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:05,766
We got three more O. D. S from this new
killerjunk they're calling Red Death.

141
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,135
What's in it?

142
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,642
It's a mix of heroin and I don't know
what else. An amino acid, maybe.

143
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:12,765
This stuff is so strong, 
they're drinking it with grain alcohol.

144
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,058
You need ten times
the usual amount of Narcan.

145
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:17,317
And when they wake up, watch out
'cause they're liable to go nuts on you.

146
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:21,609
- He one of'em?
- No, that's Noel. 
He used to be a regular off and on.

147
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:23,616
I haven't seen him for a while.
He seized and almost coded.

148
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:25,618
I gave him
a hypertonic solution.

149
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,620
He drank so much
his kidneys were taking out salt.

150
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:30,749
- That's one for the textbooks.
- Doc, you're the greatest.

151
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:34,126
- You gotta help me.
- Can you give this guy a drink of water?

152
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:36,792
Noel, I am helping you. You drink
any more water, you could die!

153
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:38,916
Hazmat, three's coding. 
We got a flatline here.

154
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:43,464
Start C. P. R. Milagros, get me an epi. 
Odette, wake up Dr Starks.

155
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:46,468
Tell him we're gonna need him stat. 
400 joules. Clear!

156
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:50,015
You want water?
I'll give you water.

157
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:52,815
- What a pain in the ass.
Just get out of here.
- 600 joules.

158
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,190
- Clear!
-  So you get drunk
every day and you fall down.

159
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:59,936
Well, why should we help you?
You'rejust gonna get drunk
tomorrow, fall down again.

160
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:01,946
Griss, this man
wants to leave.

161
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:12,740
- Thank you.
- I know him. That's Noel.

162
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:15,498
You better step outside.
Quickly.

163
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:24,883
- Get...
-  Fuck!

164
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:28,632
Noel? Noel.

165
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,136
It's... It's me.
It's Mary Burke from 49th Street.

166
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:36,562
Oh, Mary.

167
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:41,235
Oh, Mary, I'm so thirsty. They won't
give me any water to drink in there.

168
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:43,570
- Please.
- I'll get you some.

169
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,575
I wouldn't do that.

170
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:54,287
The doctor seems to think he's suffering
from some rare disorder.

171
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:02,416
He's had a rough life.
He grew up on our street.

172
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,709
He's a little crazy from it,
but that's no excuse...

173
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:08,428
for not giving somebody
a lousy cup of water.

174
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,353
Here.

175
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:23,571
My father's dying, Noel.

176
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:31,160
Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary.

177
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:36,703
Oh.

178
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:43,840
}}

179
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:51,130
} But it doesn't mean
I didn't try }

180
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:54,552
} I just never know why }

181
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,139
Chinese closes in five minutes.

182
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:03,101
Beef lo mein. Been on my mind
since I awoke. What do you think?

183
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:06,487
I think the moment that food
hits your mouth, we'll get a run.

184
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:09,651
Turn here. You missed it.
Chink's on 11 th.

185
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:23,503
- Oh, finally. Where you been?
-

186
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:28,885
Hey, ambulance man, 
what you looking at?

187
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:35,347
Yeah, pretty soon
you'll be coming for me.

188
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:37,803
Do you think he'll come for me?|

189
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,938
Pretty soon
you'll be coming for me.

190
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:51,861
Boy, some partner you are, Frank.
I could've walked there faster.

191
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:56,038
I'm starving, and you stop to talk
to hookers. You're making me nuts.

192
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:59,035
Is that what you're trying to do?
Drag me down to Nutsville with you?

193
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:16,682
- Oh, no!
- What?

194
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,811
I just remembered. I'm so stupid.
I had beef lo mein last night.

195
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:22,608
I can't eat the same thing
two nights in a row.

196
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:25,983
It's almost 2:00. What the hell am
I gonna do? What are you getting?

197
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:28,946
- I'm not hungry.
- Yeah, you don't eat food.

198
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,231
I eat.

199
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:35,234
Larry, I eat.
Just haven't had coffee yet.

200
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:38,656
Only coffee and whisky.
Lucky you ain't dead with that diet.

201
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,830
I got it.

202
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,578
Half fried chicken
and fries. Let's go.

203
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,382
} You can't put your arm
around a memory }

204
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:54,715
- } Foreign bodies }
- } You can't put your arm
around a memory }

205
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:58,846
} And the sunlight shining
through the crack in the windowpane }

206
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:03,227
} Numbs my brain }

207
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:11,273
} And the sunlight shining
through the crack in the windowpane }

208
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:13,613
Rose's ghost was getting closer.

209
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:16,280
} Numbs my brain }

210
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:19,282
It had been six months since I lost her. 
A homeless girl,

211
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:22,866
asthmatic, 18 years old.

212
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:25,124
I used to block
the bad calls out.

213
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:29,797
I used to forget, 
but she wouldn't let go.

214
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:33,211
And now she'd come
to bear witness for all of them,

215
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,883
all that had been lost.

216
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:40,638
These spirits
were part of thejob.

217
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:44,601
It was impossible to pass a building
that didn't hold a ghost of something.

218
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:48,480
The eyes of a corpse. 
The screams of a loved one.

219
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,814
All bodies leave their mark.

220
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:55,815
You cannot be near the newly dead
without feeling it.

221
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,326
I could handle that.

222
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:02,159
What haunted me now
was more savage.

223
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,248
Spirits born half-finished.

224
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:07,579
Homicides. 
Suicides. Overdoses.

225
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:11,164
Accusing me of being there, 
witnessing a humiliation,

226
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,672
which they
could never forgive.

227
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:20,339
Turn it off.

228
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:23,927
- What?
- You know what. The radio.

229
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:27,348
That's not the police band. It's your
fire department scanner in your bag.

230
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:29,689
- Oh.
-
Ladder Four, respond to a 10-22.

231
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:32,356
Six-flight residential. 
534 West 32.

232
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:36,320
- Let's do it.
It might be a good one.
- There are no good fires.

233
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,448
People die in fires. People get burned
up in fires. People can't breathe.

234
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:43,450
That's what we're here for.
Let's go.

235
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:46,500
- 63...
- Don't push it, Larry.

236
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:48,952
- Oh, you're burned out, man.
You're scorched.
- Not yet, Larry.

237
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:52,042
I'm still burning. If you get
any closer, I'm gonna put a burn on you.

238
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:57,334
6-3 Zebra. 6-3 Zebra. 
Zebra three, I need you.

239
00:17:57,471 --> 00:17:59,511
- You see? He's giving it to us anyway.
- Zebra, are you there?

240
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,969
- I'm holding
an unconscious at 9th and 41 st. 
- No, no, no!

241
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:07,222
3:00 in the morning. 
That can only mean one thing.

242
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:09,395
- Mr Oh.
- Mr Oh. I'm not answering it.

243
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:11,564
Answer the radio, Zebra.
You know it's that time.

244
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:15,063
Four times this week I've had him.
Aren't there any other units out there?

245
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,735
- Zebra, are you there?
- Don't answer it. 
They'll get somebody else.

246
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:21,567
63-Zebra, answer me now, or I'm sending
a captain to your location.

247
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:25,867
Frank,
when I say don't answer it, that means
answer it. You could do me that favour.

248
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,909
- 6- 3 Zebra. 
- Yes, Zebra, you'll be driving...

249
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,250
to the man who needs no introduction.

250
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:33,380
Chronic caller of the year, three
straight and shooting for number four,

251
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:36,259
the duke of drunk, 
the king of stink,

252
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:39,552
- our most frequent flyer, Mr Oh. 
- 10-4.

253
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,218
Don't do it. 
Not this time...

254
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:45,599
Relax. It's a street job. 
It's easy except for the smell.

255
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:48,645
We just throw him in the back,
zip over to Mercy.

256
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:52,722
No blood, no dying. That's how
I look at it. He's just a drunk.

257
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,733
It's not our job
to taxi drunks around.

258
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,435
Yeah, but they're just
gonna keep calling.

259
00:18:57,573 --> 00:19:00,858
Someone's gonna have a cardiac,
and the only medics will
be taking care of Mr Oh.

260
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:04,658
He's bad, mister. 
He ain't eaten nothing all day.

261
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:06,662
And he's seizing
and throwing up.

262
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,079
- So, what's different about him today?
- He says his feet hurt.

263
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:14,085
- Oh, why didn't you say so?
- I can't find a pulse, 
but he's still breathing.

264
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:16,622
Well, it looks like we're just in time.
Step aside, sir.

265
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,510
- He's drunk.
- He's sick. You gotta help him.

266
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,510
He's fine.
He can walk to the hospital.

267
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:24,011
Walk? Are you crazy?
He's in the wheelchair.

268
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:26,679
Oh, don't give me that.
He walks better than I do.

269
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,808
-
- Oh! Oh! That's right, Mr Oh.

270
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:34,059
Come on, buddy. Your limo's here.

271
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:37,063
-
- Get better.
- Good luck, old buddy.

272
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:41,145
- } I gotta get running now }
- } Bell Boy }

273
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:44,154
- } Keep your lip buttoned down }
- } Bell Boy }

274
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:46,658
- Oh!
- } Carry the bloody baggage out }}

275
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,992
- Faster! Come on, Frank. Faster!
- Faster?

276
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,328
You want faster?|

277
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:59,590
Oh, no.
Take that stinky-ass motherfucking
bug-ridden skell out of my face!

278
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:01,675
Johnny, welcome back.
Good to see ya.

279
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:04,010
And my conscience simply
will not allow that.

280
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,381
Griss, this gentleman
would like to leave.

281
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:09,186
Oh! He looks so pale.

282
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:12,597
Hey, you getting enough to eat?
You getting your fibre?

283
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:14,890
Wasted. That's my diagnosis.
He's shit-faced.

284
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:18,477
He just needs a bath and some food.
Let's take him in back.

285
00:20:18,612 --> 00:20:21,364
- Get a stretcher. 
- She's nuts. That's why he comes here.

286
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,732
- She encourages him.
- Don't you dare.
This is not a homeless shelter.

287
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:26,240
- He's gonna have to wait in the lobby.
- No way, man.

288
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,695
Not even in the corner.
Griss cannot abide the funk tonight.

289
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,500
Senor. Senor.|

290
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:54,677
My first cigarette
in over a year.

291
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:57,353
First is always the best.

292
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:04,240
The doctor doesn't think
my father will make it.

293
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:07,320
Said he was dead for too long.

294
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:10,074
After six minutes,
the brain starts to die,

295
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:12,957
and after that,

296
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,954
just close the door.

297
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:18,756
You never know.

298
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:22,380
You know, my father and I
haven't spoken in three years.

299
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:26,589
When my brother called me and said
that my father had a heart attack...

300
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:30,387
and that he locked himself
in the bathroom,

301
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:33,435
all the way going over there,
I was thinking of...

302
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:36,480
how I was gonna tell him
what a bastard he was.

303
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:41,732
When I got there
and we put him up on the bed,

304
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:47,201
and I thought of all the other things
that I wanted to say to him...

305
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:56,624
Well, right now I'm more worried
about my mother than anything.

306
00:21:56,752 --> 00:22:00,619
Go home. Take her home.
Get some rest.

307
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:04,456
- You're not gonna
find anything out now.
- That's what I told her.

308
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:08,294
If she could just see him for a second,
then I know she'd let me take her home.

309
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,423
Thanks for the light.

310
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:13,393
Here's your dinner.
I wheel, you heal.

311
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:19,815
6-2 David, at 38th and 2, 
you'll find a three-car accident.

312
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:21,981
Two taxis and a taxi.

313
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:25,480
6- 2 Henry, 6-2 Henry. 
487 West 22.

314
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:28,366
Report of a very bad smell. 
No further information.

315
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:30,401
Larry, swing over to 10th. We're gonna
have to run one of these calls.

316
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:32,908
- Relax, will ya?
-

317
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,663
The biggest problem with not driving...

318
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:40,375
is that whenever there's a patient
in the back, you're also in the back.

319
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:44,003
- The door's closed. You're trapped. 
- } Let me breathe }}

320
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:49,008
5:00 or 6:00 in the morning is always
the worst time for me. Just before dawn.

321
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:51,011
Just when you've been
lulled into thinking...

322
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,509
it might be safe to close
your eyes for one minute.

323
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:57,134
That's when
I first found Rose.

324
00:22:57,271 --> 00:23:01,600
She was on the sidewalk, 
not breathing.

325
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:07,065
I'm not feeling very well, Larry.

326
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:10,198
Let's say we go back
to the hospital, call it a night.

327
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:14,703
You got no sick time, Frank. No time
of any kind. Everyone knows that.

328
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,535
Take me back.
Put me to bed. I surrender.

329
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,540
We've done
enough damage tonight.

330
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:22,124
You take things way
too seriously, Frank.

331
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:27,216
You ever think
of doing anything else?

332
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:29,335
Sure.

333
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:34,506
Taking my captain's
exam next year.

334
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:38,093
Once the kids are in school,
Louise can go back to the post office.

335
00:23:38,228 --> 00:23:40,933
I thought, "What the hell?
I'll start my own medic service. "

336
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:45,014
Out on the island, the volunteers
are becoming salaried municipal.

337
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,735
It's just a matter of time
and who you know.

338
00:23:48,864 --> 00:23:53,491
Someday it's gonna be
Chief Larry calling the shots.

339
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:11,040
I'd always had nightmares.

340
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:15,010
But now the ghosts
didn't wait for me to sleep.

341
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,058
I drank every day.

342
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:20,557
"Help others
and you help yourself. "

343
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:23,261
That was my motto.

344
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:26,353
But I hadn't saved
anyone in months.

345
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:29,356
It seemed all my patients
were dying on me.

346
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:32,275
I'd waited, 
sure the sickness would break.

347
00:24:32,408 --> 00:24:37,116
Maybe the next call, maybe tomorrow, 
the feeling would drop away.

348
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:41,540
More than anything else, 
I wanted to sleep like that.

349
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:44,952
Close my eyes
and drift away.

350
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:52,126
Zebra. 6-3 Zebra.

351
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,470
Zebra.

352
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,637
Zebra, answer the radio.
Come on. I got one for you.

353
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:05,265
Pick up the radio and push the button
on the side and speak into the front.

354
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,236
Come on. Zebra?

355
00:25:17,536 --> 00:25:20,822
- Zebra.
- Suicidal male bleeding,

356
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:23,494
corner of 44th and 8th.

357
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,081
No further information.

358
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:28,749
10-4.

359
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:35,003
We have a call, Chief. 
Somebody's bleeding. 44th and 8th.

360
00:25:35,137 --> 00:25:39,087
No, no. Brake! Brake!
It's the water. Turn around.

361
00:25:40,768 --> 00:25:43,093
}}

362
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:50,193
Come on. Kill me!
Push it in! Do it!

363
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,862
Kill me! Huh? Come on.
Kill me. Just push it. Huh?

364
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,110
I'm gonna cut
my throat, man.

365
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:04,869
No, don't!
Drop the bottle.

366
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,242
- Put down the bottle.
- He's crazy.

367
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:11,375
Really? You look pretty thirsty,
Noel. You want some water?

368
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:17,252
See, I can't do it.
I came out of the desert.

369
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:19,546
Those people left me
in the sun to die.

370
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:21,555
You came out
of the hospital.

371
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:23,557
You were tied down
and hallucinating.

372
00:26:23,686 --> 00:26:25,559
You got some bad
chemicals in your head.

373
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:28,558
- There's some medicine at
the hospital that'll fix that.
- No! No medicine.

374
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:31,727
- No medicine.
- He got ya.
-  Do it!

375
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,154
Man wants to die? I know how to kill
that mother. Pop, pop.

376
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:41,404
- Oh, sh...
- Shit!

377
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:47,657
Noel! Noel!

378
00:26:47,793 --> 00:26:51,328
Noel!
Larry, call for backup.

379
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:56,374
6-3 Zebra, 
10-85 forthwith, 44 and 8th.

380
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,633
Get out of the road,
you crazy bastard!

381
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:00,636
Noel, you didn't
let me finish.

382
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:04,429
We have rules against killing people
on the street, okay? It looks bad.

383
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,430
There's a special room
at the hospital for terminating.

384
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:10,350
It's a nice quiet room
with a big bed.

385
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:15,558
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

386
00:27:17,322 --> 00:27:19,196
Man, thank you, man.

387
00:27:19,324 --> 00:27:22,859
Wait a minute. How?
How are you gonna kill me?

388
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:27,075
Well, you have a choice.
You can have pills, injection or gas.

389
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,909
- Pills. Definitely pills.
-  You fucking arsehole!

390
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:49,134
Tom Wolls,
that crazy motherfucker.

391
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:51,940
- He used to be my partner.
- Frank.

392
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:56,648
This the guy you called about?
I know you.

393
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,776
- Nah, you don't know me.
You don't know me.
- Oh, yes, I do, Pedro. I do.

394
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:03,909
- I know you. I know him.
- I don't think so.

395
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:06,408
You give my friend here
any more trouble, I'll kill ya.

396
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:09,290
- Yeah, at the hospital.
- What?

397
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,290
At the hospital. He's gonna
kill me in the hospital.

398
00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:13,292
Forget the hospital.
I'll kill you here.

399
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,172
This looks like a very bad man
I took in a couple of weeks ago...

400
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:19,003
who'd been holding two priests...
not one, two priests...

401
00:28:19,134 --> 00:28:21,672
hostage with a screwdriver, 
and I told him...

402
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:24,010
if he was ever caught
making trouble again,

403
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:26,677
- I'd kick the murdering life out of him.
- It's not worth it, Tom.

404
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,012
- He's surrendering.
- What?

405
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:32,683
- The war's over.
- Not mine.

406
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:36,018
Hey, Pedro, come here,
you little motherfucker.

407
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:38,025
I just want to talk to you,

408
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:40,479
give you a little
psychological first aid.

409
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:43,401
I'm gonna give you your first lesson
on how to be an American.

410
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:45,740
It's called
"Eatin' My Shit. "

411
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:48,360
- Come here. 
-

412
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:51,700
Tom, don't do it,
Tom. Tom!

413
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:53,707
I have to take him
to the hospital.

414
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:57,999
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- Get up here, motherfucker!

415
00:28:58,132 --> 00:28:59,792
- That's enough!
- Take that!

416
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:03,294
There's a double shooting three blocks
down. 41 st and 8th, confirmed.

417
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:06,299
We'll do that.
Larry. Larry. Larry!

418
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,050
- I'll take it. Motherfucker!
- That's enough.

419
00:29:10,185 --> 00:29:13,804
I'll do that. I'll see you
over there, okay?

420
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:16,774
- What happened?
-

421
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:25,025
Oh, man. Just walked up
and shot him. Not a word.

422
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,026
- Damn, that was cold.
- E. M. S. Move it.

423
00:29:29,163 --> 00:29:31,321
- Where are you hit?
-

424
00:29:31,457 --> 00:29:34,742
You see this shit, man?
Niggas put a hole in me.

425
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:39,788
Yo, Tiger did this shit, yo.
And money right here work for Outlaw.

426
00:29:46,805 --> 00:29:50,885
-  We got a gang war
about to start, yo. 
- Take a deep breath.

427
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:59,272
Major Tom! I'm going to Misery!
You take yours to Bellevue.

428
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:02,604
Okay, Frank, you take yours to heaven.
I'll take mine to hell. Let's go.

429
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:05,276
Get him on the board.
Let's go.

430
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:11,735
You're gonna feel a stick in your arm.
Don't move.

431
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:14,445
Listen, I'm quitting, man.

432
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,204
I'm going in the army
where it's safe.

433
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:19,625
I don't wanna die.

434
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:22,791
- No, I wanna die. I'm the one.
- You're not gonna die.

435
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:25,795
- What did you say?
- Shut up! You're going to die.
He's not. Got it?

436
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:29,628
- Hold my hand, man. 
- I can't. I gotta do the other arm.

437
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:33,549
- Hold my hand, man.
- Hold this.

438
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:35,974
If you let go,
I swear I won't kill you.

439
00:30:45,614 --> 00:30:48,401
It's all right. We're here.

440
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,162
Fuck.

441
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,830
He's not breathing.
Call a code.

442
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:02,287
Noel, let's go.

443
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:05,258
Let's go!

444
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:09,002
Fucking Christ.

445
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:15,848
So here I am. And this junkie
got something jammed in his teeth.

446
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:19,181
Now, none of thesejunkies wanna give
mouth-to-mouth. It was a blow dryer.

447
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:22,600
So I pulls it out. 
His body was cold except for his throat.

448
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:26,186
It had been blow-dried for an hour.
Junkie had second-degree burns
of the tongue.

449
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:28,610
Did you ever give mouth-to-mouth?

450
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:31,445
A long time ago,
when I was your age, boy. Never again.

451
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:34,661
Chances are you end up
with a mouthful of puke. Junkie puke.

452
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:38,703
I'd do it if I had to.
It's part of the job.

453
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,992
- What about you?
- What?

454
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:43,204
You ever do
mouth-to-mouth before?

455
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:46,542
- Once. On a baby.
-  Oh, babies.

456
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:49,878
Now, babies are a whole
different thing entirely.

457
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:52,384
Did I ever tell you about the time
that white woman approached me?

458
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:56,097
I said, "Ma'am, I'm a true cocksman, 
and I don't mix my seed. "

459
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:59,263
Only time you see me with a white woman
when I'm holdin'her for the police. "

460
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:01,934
That's the truth.

461
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:07,645
You shouldn't smoke.

462
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:12,899
It's okay.
They're prescription.

463
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:15,656
Works better
with a little whisky.

464
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:20,409
Yeah, that was my brother's problem.
That's why he's passed out inside.

465
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,416
That's it!

466
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:26,328
I've had it!
Can't take it anymore.

467
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:35,005
- You got... blood on...
- I know.

468
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:41,342
That boy you brought in,
he's, uh, shot, wasn't he?

469
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,354
Yeah.

470
00:32:44,983 --> 00:32:47,023
He's dead, huh?

471
00:32:47,152 --> 00:32:49,061
Yes.

472
00:32:50,698 --> 00:32:53,271
I think this place stinks.

473
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:56,943
- Our Lady of Misery.
- It's crazy in there.

474
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,953
What's the matter
with that doctor...

475
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:01,406
who keeps mumbling and poking himself
in the eye whenever he talks to me?

476
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:03,949
He's working a double shift.

477
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:08,955
Well, my father's in there.
He's in a coma.

478
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:11,878
My mother,
she's... she's going crazy.

479
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,803
It's like, uh,
she's in a trance.

480
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:19,968
She should go home.

481
00:33:20,102 --> 00:33:23,518
Yeah, well, I'd take her, 
but somebody's got to stay here.

482
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:28,063
- Did you see him?
-  It wasn't him.

483
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:30,067
You saw him?

484
00:33:30,195 --> 00:33:33,399
They showed me someone.
It wasn't him. It wasn't my husband.

485
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:36,486
Mrs Burke, they'll take care of him.
You should go home now.

486
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:38,492
I should know my own husband.

487
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,494
They wouldn't let me see him.

488
00:33:40,622 --> 00:33:43,327
Larry and I'll drop her home.
Help me get her to the ambulance.

489
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:46,828
Mom, they're gonna give you a ride home.
Come on. This way.

490
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:51,462
You want some coffee?

491
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:53,999
I have applesauce cake too.

492
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:57,339
- Right here. Right there.
- Oh.

493
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,465
Thanks.

494
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,173
I'll call you
if anything changes.

495
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:30,871
Saving someone's
life is like falling in love.

496
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:33,082
The best drug in the world.

497
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:37,380
For days, 
sometimes weeks afterwards,

498
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:41,557
you walk the street
making infinite whatever you see.

499
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,599
Once, for a few weeks, 
I couldn't feel the earth.

500
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,938
Everything I touched
became lighter.

501
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:54,563
Horns played in my shoes. 
Flowers fell from my pockets.

502
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:57,270
You wonder
if you've become immortal,

503
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,527
as if you've saved
your own life as well.

504
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:03,234
God has passed through you.

505
00:35:03,372 --> 00:35:06,539
Why deny it
that for a moment there...

506
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:11,293
Why deny for a moment there
God was you?

507
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:19,762
Taking credit when things go right
doesn't work the other way.

508
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:25,096
When things go wrong, 
spreading the blame is an
essential medic survival tool.

509
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:28,810
"The elevator broke down. "
"The boyfriend was crazy. "

510
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:32,604
"I should've called in sick. "
"The tube wouldn't go in. "

511
00:35:32,735 --> 00:35:37,610
The god of hellfire is not a role
that anyone wants to play.

512
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:07,261
- Good morning, Captain.
- What am I gonna do with this guy?

513
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:12,437
Pierce, I just got off the phone
with Borough Command.

514
00:36:12,566 --> 00:36:16,646
Out of 12 shifts this month,
you've been late for nine, sick four.

515
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:19,317
That includes the shift where you
came in late, you went home early.

516
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:22,153
- I'm sick. That's what
I've been telling you.
- You're sick?

517
00:36:22,284 --> 00:36:24,158
You're killing me,
do you know that?

518
00:36:24,286 --> 00:36:27,904
You've got no sick time
left according to Command.
I mean, I was told to terminate.

519
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,990
It's okay. I'll just get
my things out of my locker.

520
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:36,172
Excuse me. It's not okay.
L-I never fired anybody in my life, man.

521
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:39,299
I'm sorry, Captain.
Don't take it too hard.

522
00:36:43,138 --> 00:36:47,681
Nobody tells me to fire anybody, ever.

523
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,642
I told them, "Stick it right up
your big one. " Pardon me.

524
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:54,939
I said, "You wanna fire him?
Come on over and do it yourself. "

525
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:58,021
You know they won't do it.
It's up to you. You've gotta be strong.

526
00:36:58,153 --> 00:37:02,021
- Be a man.
- I am a man.
You think they give these to sissies?

527
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:05,906
Come on, kid. This is a weekend
of full moons. Nobody wants to work.

528
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:08,029
I mean, your partner
Larry's called in sick.

529
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:11,200
Okay, Larry Veeber.
Stupid Stanley too.

530
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:15,034
Come on. I need bodies out there. 
I got buses that gotta run.

531
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,044
I had to put Marcus on 62-Young.

532
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:20,292
Hey. Hey. You know he's not
supposed to work two nights in a row.

533
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:23,213
- You know what we're in for
with that one?
- You swore you'd fire me...

534
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:25,552
if I came in late again.

535
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:28,219
- I'll fire you tomorrow. 
-

536
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,387
Even better than that,
what was I thinking about?

537
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,556
I could forward you some sick time.
How about a week?

538
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,893
A week's not gonna do it.
A week's not gonna do it.

539
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:42,650
- Kid, you're saying
no, it ain't gonna do it.
-

540
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:48,359
You're going out
with Marcus. Okay?

541
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:50,369
Duty calls you, kid.
The city needs you. Please.

542
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:53,368
I'll front you sick time. 
I'll make it up to you. Honest to God.

543
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,545
Look at me. The next time
I see you, I'll fire you.

544
00:37:57,671 --> 00:38:01,539
- I can bark too.
- Pierce, you can do it all.

545
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:03,882
I never said
I could bark better than you.

546
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:07,047
Go and help... Go and help
the people of New York. Go ahead.

547
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,850
Get out there and mop them up for me. 
Go ahead. Do yourjob.

548
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:13,344
- Do yourjob. You're the best. 
-  Put down that crack stem.

549
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:16,640
Put down that crack stem
and drop your jug of sin,

550
00:38:16,732 --> 00:38:20,101
your high-heeled skirts
and your stock dividends,

551
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:23,439
your patent leather underwear,
televised suicides,

552
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:27,237
lap dancers in leotards
in delicatessens.

553
00:38:27,368 --> 00:38:31,946
And the Lord said, 
"If you can find one that
isn't a sinner... just one...

554
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:35,450
- then I will spare the city. "
- My Lord, Mother of Man.

555
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:39,913
Boy, you look like hell.
What you drinking?

556
00:38:40,047 --> 00:38:43,665
Captain almost fired me tonight.
I'm on my way out.

557
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,674
- 
- Anytime now.

558
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:48,887
Nobody gets fired, son. 
Look at me.

559
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:52,217
The most they might do
is transfer you to the Bronx.

560
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:55,636
Boy, you look like you aged about
ten years since I rode with you last.

561
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:58,179
I ain't feeling so hot.

562
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:03,648
I've been seeing the ghosts.

563
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:08,483
- You mean the people we lost?
- Yeah.

564
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:11,108
If they got to go, got to go.
God bless 'em.

565
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:16,749
You ever notice people who see shit
are always crazy? Mm-hmm.

566
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,749
Scientific fact.

567
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:21,997
- I think the worst is over.
- Oh, no, son.

568
00:39:22,131 --> 00:39:26,045
It can always get worse.
See, you can't change what's out there.

569
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:28,050
Only where
you're coming from.

570
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:30,716
So you got to let the good Lord...
Thank you, Jesus...

571
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:33,136
take over in here.

572
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:36,517
6-2 Young.
Let's go, 6-2 Young. Answer the radio.

573
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:39,516
Marcus, it's Love.
I haven't heard her in months.

574
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:43,183
Well, no,
she only works when I'm on.

575
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:46,023
I makes her wait.
Drives her crazy.

576
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:49,274
- It is true you and Love
went on a blind date?
- Mm-hmm.

577
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:52,741
- She hit you with a bottle?
- Why you gotta bring that up?

578
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,862
She loves me the way
no woman ever has.

579
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:57,155
6-2 Young, I don't have time
for your games.

580
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,864
Now, answer me or do I have
to come out there myself?

581
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:02,208
Oh, sookie, sookie.
Now. Rough.

582
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:05,291
Now, see, I usually don't do
calls before my coffee,

583
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:08,544
but I think this'll
be good for you, son.

584
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:11,215
- 6-2 Young is here, baby.
-

585
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:13,719
And I'm gonna take care of you.

586
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:18,475
} Don't you worry
'bout a thing }}

587
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:20,181
Come on, white boy.

588
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:24,976
'Cause Big Daddy Marcus
is alive and on arrival, baby.

589
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,897
I'm not your baby, Young. 
I'm not your mother either.

590
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,407
You're going to a cardiac arrest. 
30th and 11 th, north-east corner.

591
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:35,072
It's a club. 
Take the back entrance.

592
00:40:35,204 --> 00:40:37,873
All right, 10-4, sweet mama.
You feeling better, Frank?

593
00:40:37,998 --> 00:40:39,872
- I feel worse.
- Oh, that's good, boy.

594
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,334
- This here is for you.
-

595
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,931
I hope we're not too late from you folks
holding us up here. Excuse me.

596
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:56,931
Right this way.

597
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:00,475
}}

598
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,874
Get the hell out of my way.

599
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,874
Okay, what happened?

600
00:41:24,002 --> 00:41:27,418
- Please tell me he's gonna be all right.
- No, he dead.

601
00:41:27,548 --> 00:41:30,299
- You buggin'. We just signed
our first record deal.
- Look, he dead, son.

602
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:32,383
Ain't nothing we can do about it.
Come on, Frank. That's it.

603
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:35,631
-  What do you mean he's dead?
-  He's not dead.

604
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:38,302
It's a heroin overdose.
Let's break out the Narcan.

605
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:43,309
He's dead, unless you folks wanna stop
bullshitting me and tell it straight.

606
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:46,439
Then, the good Lord willing,
we'll try and bring him back.

607
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,650
He broke up
with his old lady.

608
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:52,483
- We didn't break up.
We were just seeing other people.
- Oh, she broke his heart.

609
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:55,818
- Shut up, arsehole! Nobody asked you!
- Was I talking to you?

610
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:58,157
Dick, shut up!

611
00:41:58,287 --> 00:42:00,160
I'm still waiting
and this young man here is still dead.

612
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:03,989
- You wanna leave here
in a body bag too?
- You'll end up like him, dick!

613
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:08,337
- Shut up!
- He's been snorting
that Red Death stuff.

614
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:11,667
It's been going on
for, like, four days now.

615
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,842
I rebuke the spirit of drugs
in the name of Jesus. What's his name?

616
00:42:16,972 --> 00:42:19,012
- I. B. Bangin'. 
- What you mean I. B. Bangin'?

617
00:42:19,141 --> 00:42:21,264
- I. B. Bangin'.
- What the hell kind of name
is I. B. Bangin'?

618
00:42:21,393 --> 00:42:23,350
- I don't know his real name. 
- It's Frederick Smith.

619
00:42:23,479 --> 00:42:25,352
-  Okay, Freddy... 
- It's Frederick.

620
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:28,814
Okay, I. B. Bangin', we're gonna
bring you back from the dead.

621
00:42:28,942 --> 00:42:32,027
Now, I want everybody here to grab
the hand of the person next to you.

622
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:37,156
Come on now.
We ain't got much time.

623
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:39,609
And look up
towards the heavens.

624
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:43,743
Dear Lord, 
here I am again...

625
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:48,121
asking one more chance
for a sinner.

626
00:42:48,253 --> 00:42:52,962
Please, Lord, bring back
I. B. Bangin', Lord.

627
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:56,840
You have the power, Jesus.
You have the might.

628
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,885
You have the super light
to spare this worthless man.

629
00:43:02,184 --> 00:43:04,971
- My God! Frederick!
- Rise up, I. B. Bangin'...

630
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:07,725
and start your life anew!

631
00:43:07,856 --> 00:43:09,730
Oh, thank You, Lord.

632
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:12,895
- What happened?
- You fucking died, you stupid bastard.

633
00:43:13,028 --> 00:43:15,566
- I warned you.
- Damn, you guys are good.
-  Not us.

634
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:20,276
The first step is Love.
The second is Mercy.

635
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:29,377
That guy I brought in yesterday,
post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

636
00:43:29,503 --> 00:43:32,457
Burke? You're not gonna believe it.
He's showing cognitive signs.

637
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:36,089
It started with spontaneous respiration.
Now he's fighting to pull out the tube.

638
00:43:36,218 --> 00:43:39,254
He had to be sedated. He's in CAT scan.
There's no room in I. C. U.

639
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:41,262
- What do you think?
- Who knows?

640
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:45,222
It's all lower brain stem
activity at this point. 
The heart refuses to stabilize.

641
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:49,266
You know, he coded 11 times
since he got here.

642
00:43:49,398 --> 00:43:51,272
But the guy's a fighter.

643
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,309
Every time the Valium wears off, 
he starts yanking on the restraints.

644
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:55,270
The family know?

645
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:57,610
I wanted to bring them in
to see if he'd respond to voices.

646
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,613
But there was no one
in the waiting room.

647
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:01,615
This guy's daughter
was in my face all night.

648
00:44:01,744 --> 00:44:03,617
Finally, I got something
positive to tell her, she's gone.

649
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:07,577
You put poison in your veins,
and now that you're breathing again,

650
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:11,753
you can't wait to say
"Thank you very much"
and get back out to poison shopping.

651
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:14,548
Well, since we saved your life,
could you do us a favour...

652
00:44:14,673 --> 00:44:16,547
and stop breathing
in another city next time?

653
00:44:16,675 --> 00:44:18,549
I ever tell you
about that time years ago...

654
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:22,129
I was on this ledge uptown
trying to pull this damn psycho inside?

655
00:44:22,264 --> 00:44:26,214
You mean where the guy jumped
and you almost fell?
No, you never told me that story.

656
00:44:26,351 --> 00:44:28,225
No, you never listened.

657
00:44:28,353 --> 00:44:33,478
There I was.
I put everything I had into saving
this dumb-ass, low-life suicidal...

658
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:37,108
that when he went down,
it was like I wanted to go with him.

659
00:44:37,237 --> 00:44:39,111
That happened once in Ireland.

660
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:43,319
This girl jumped off the cliffs
of Moher and the wind blew her back up.

661
00:44:43,452 --> 00:44:47,284
- The wind blew her back up?
- Yeah, the wind.

662
00:44:47,414 --> 00:44:49,952
- No, that was Jesus, son.
- It was also the wind.

663
00:44:50,084 --> 00:44:52,372
The wind, my black ass. 
That was Jesus.

664
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:54,329
Don't tell me
about the Good Book.

665
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:57,168
I'll preach heaven and beat the hell
out of you. Don't tell me that now.

666
00:44:57,299 --> 00:44:59,256
I was going, son.

667
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:04,177
But if someone up on high... Thank You,
Jesus... hadn't have pulled me in...

668
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:06,346
Would you turn left here?
I wanna make a stop.

669
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:12,145
The point is, everybody go through a
stretch where folks gonna die on you.

670
00:45:12,272 --> 00:45:14,514
Just don't meditate on it.

671
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,609
} I say open up the window }

672
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:22,490
I'll be right back.

673
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:25,024
} And let me breathe }

674
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:31,122
} I say open the window }

675
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:38,630
- } And let me breathe }
- Hello. It's Frank Pierce
from the ambulance last night.

676
00:45:38,757 --> 00:45:40,880
I brought your father
into the hospital.

677
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:44,046
- I just learned some news. 
-  I'll be right down.

678
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,470
} I cried for ya }

679
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,184
He's better, isn't he?

680
00:45:52,312 --> 00:45:54,685
Well, the doctor says
he's showing some movement.

681
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,314
I mean, it's still early. It might mean
nothing, but I thought you'd wanna know.

682
00:45:58,444 --> 00:46:03,106
- } I cried for ya }}
- Yeah, I knew.
I sensed it when I heard your voice.

683
00:46:05,117 --> 00:46:07,655
You-You look so different.

684
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:10,194
Oh.
It's awful, isn't it?

685
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,868
It's like Night
of the Living Cheerleaders.

686
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,369
No, I think it looks good.

687
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:20,086
Ah, I was going nuts in that waiting
room. I came back to check on my mom.

688
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:23,419
- How is she?
- She's sleeping.

689
00:46:23,552 --> 00:46:26,506
Sleeping.

690
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:34,353
I was just gonna get some food.
Pizza. I thought maybe we...

691
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,477
You can't kill my father that easy.
He's a real fighter, like with me.

692
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:41,444
He hasn't talked to me in three years.
But it's okay.

693
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,275
Sometimes you just have
to put things behind you.

694
00:46:44,406 --> 00:46:47,360
I gotta be getting back.
Hey. Hey!

695
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:51,325
It'll be tough to get a taxi here.
We can give you a ride if you like.

696
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:53,364
Okay.

697
00:46:56,251 --> 00:46:58,125
Who that?

698
00:46:58,253 --> 00:47:00,709
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest
I brought in last night.

699
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:04,623
I told her we'd give her a ride
back to Misery. Her father's
showing signs of improving.

700
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,137
Oh, Frank, you got it bad, son.
So much worse than what I thought.

701
00:47:09,264 --> 00:47:12,349
- I'm hungry too. We gotta get
something to eat after this.
- God, help us. He's hungry.

702
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:17,769
} These are the days }

703
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:21,647
} You might fill with laughter }

704
00:47:21,777 --> 00:47:24,694
} Until you break }

705
00:47:24,822 --> 00:47:30,326
} These days you might
feel a shaft of life }

706
00:47:30,452 --> 00:47:34,830
} Make its way
across your face }

707
00:47:34,957 --> 00:47:37,115
} And when you do }

708
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:40,168
} You'll know how it was
meant to be }

709
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:43,996
} See the signs
know their meaning }

710
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:46,006
} It's true }

711
00:47:46,135 --> 00:47:48,970
} You'll know how it was
meant to be }

712
00:47:49,096 --> 00:47:52,631
} Hear the signs
and know they're speaking }

713
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:54,675
} To you }

714
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,767
} To you }}

715
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:03,683
Dad?

716
00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:06,690
Can you hear me?

717
00:48:06,822 --> 00:48:08,731
It's Mary.

718
00:48:12,494 --> 00:48:15,697
Squeeze my hand if
you can hear me, Dad.

719
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:18,618
- 
- He squeezed my hand.

720
00:48:18,751 --> 00:48:21,076
He's moving, Doctor.
He grabbed my hand.

721
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:23,963
Come on, Dad. Show 'em.
Come on. See? See?

722
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:27,292
I'll be damned. It's movement. 
Just not sure how voluntary it is.

723
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:30,047
No, he heard me.

724
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:33,014
Come on, Dad. Yeah.

725
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:38,884
Oh! Nurse Crupp.

726
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:43,101
Nurse Crupp!
Ten milligrams of Valium!

727
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:46,318
- Get over here. 
-

728
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:49,197
- Where's that Valium?
- Why don't we step out
for a little while,

729
00:48:49,323 --> 00:48:51,197
- wait till this passes.
- Make sure he's breathing.

730
00:48:54,703 --> 00:48:56,447
He wants
to pull that tube out.

731
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,700
It's pretty painful.
That's why they keep him sedated.

732
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:02,324
- But it's a good sign.
- Are you sure?

733
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,500
I know my father
would hate being tied down.

734
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,669
He wouldn't even go
to the dentist.

735
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:09,550
That's how it's done.

736
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,422
You have to keep the body going
until the brain and the heart...

737
00:49:15,557 --> 00:49:17,431
recover enough
to go on their own.

738
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:20,097
He's better though, right?

739
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:23,395
He's better.

740
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:28,274
I'm sorry.
It's just...

741
00:49:28,404 --> 00:49:30,811
It's important to me.
I mean, a week ago...

742
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:34,281
I was wishing he was dead.

743
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:37,446
And now, I wanna hear
his voice just once more.

744
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,619
- You know what I mean?
-

745
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:41,907
Went over to Ray's and got this.

746
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:45,328
Must be a place reserved in hell
for somebody who charges $ 1. 50 a slice.

747
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:47,336
Anything comes up,
I'll call you.

748
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:50,134
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Marcus.

749
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:55,508
Oh, thank...
I'm not really hungry.

750
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:04,015
You know, my father's
a really wonderful man.

751
00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:06,520
There was nobody
he wouldn't help.

752
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,402
You know that crazy guy, Noel,
who I gave water to last night?

753
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:13,526
He lived at our house
for almost a year.

754
00:50:13,657 --> 00:50:16,824
Total stranger
he'd do anything for.

755
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:18,826
His own family, though...|

756
00:50:18,954 --> 00:50:22,121
It's best not to...
dwell.

757
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:24,206
Yeah.

758
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:26,623
It's good pizza, huh?

759
00:50:26,754 --> 00:50:29,245
Mmm, it's not as good
as, uh, Nino's.

760
00:50:29,381 --> 00:50:34,257
You remember that pizza place, 
Mimi's, on 10th, maybe 15 years ago?

761
00:50:34,386 --> 00:50:38,218
When you ordered a pie, it came with
a little plastic Madonna in the middle.

762
00:50:38,348 --> 00:50:41,385
Saint Anthony, yeah.
You from the neighbourhood?

763
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:44,270
- I grew up on 43rd.
I went to Holy Cross.
- Really?

764
00:50:44,396 --> 00:50:47,267
I went to Sacred Heart.
Where'd you go to high school?

765
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:52,310
Well, you know, Mary,
we moved out after that. Upstate.

766
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:55,862
Yeah. Like everybody else,
except us.

767
00:50:57,576 --> 00:51:00,743
- So, your parents... Good. 
- They're fine.

768
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:04,205
My old man's a bus driver,
and Mom a nurse.

769
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:06,954
Sort of born to it,
I guess.

770
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,460
- You married?
- Uh, no.

771
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:14,385
I was.

772
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,383
Hard to explain.

773
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:22,677
She had a hard time
adjusting to, uh...

774
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:26,677
Well, maybe-maybe
it was my fault too.

775
00:51:26,814 --> 00:51:29,305
-  White cocksucker!
Don't be touchin'me!
-

776
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:32,775
Is it always this bad in here?
How does anybody survive?

777
00:51:32,903 --> 00:51:36,817
- Gosh. 
- Well, it's been bad lately,
but it's-it's always bad.

778
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:39,618
- 
- How long have you been doing this?

779
00:51:39,743 --> 00:51:41,783
Five years.

780
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:44,747
Wow. You must've
seen some things, huh?

781
00:51:44,873 --> 00:51:47,791
Well, no. I mean, you sort of learn
to block it out, you know?

782
00:51:47,918 --> 00:51:52,580
It's like, um... like cops
fencing off a crime scene.

783
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:56,759
But then,
something good'll happen.

784
00:51:56,885 --> 00:51:59,720
Everything just glows.

785
00:52:01,473 --> 00:52:03,881
You must get
a lot of overdoses.

786
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:06,390
Bet you picked me up
a couple times.

787
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:09,388
I think I'd remember that.

788
00:52:09,523 --> 00:52:11,979
Maybe not.

789
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:14,232
I was a different person then.

790
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,814
Does everyone you meet
just...

791
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:22,698
- spill their guts on you like this?
- Uh, mostly.

792
00:52:22,828 --> 00:52:24,737
Must be my face.

793
00:52:24,872 --> 00:52:26,948
My mother always said
I look like a priest.

794
00:52:27,082 --> 00:52:30,000
You do. Yeah.

795
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:33,128
Yeah, my mom thought
I was gonna be a nun...

796
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:38,415
because, uh, I ran away
to a convent when I was 13.

797
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:43,629
But I didn't want to be a nun.
I just... I wanted to run away.

798
00:52:43,766 --> 00:52:48,926
Well, Sister Mary or Mary the Junkie,
it didn't really matter to me.

799
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:53,888
- You know, I better go
check on my father.
- Yeah, all right.

800
00:52:55,027 --> 00:52:57,185
Thanks for the pizza.
I owe you one.

801
00:52:57,321 --> 00:53:00,654
Maybe, um,
when he gets better.

802
00:53:00,783 --> 00:53:04,483
- When we're through with all of this.
- Sure.

803
00:53:11,168 --> 00:53:13,125
Look after her, Griss,
okay?

804
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:20,085
- }} 
- Rule number one: Don't
get involved with patients.

805
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:23,255
Rule number two: Don't get involved
with patients' daughters.

806
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:25,262
- You understand?
-
What about rule number three?

807
00:53:25,391 --> 00:53:27,264
Don't get involved
with dispatchers named Love.

808
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:29,930
Now, boy, you don't know nothin'
about rule number three.

809
00:53:30,062 --> 00:53:33,846
Cannot begin to understand
the complexities of that rule.

810
00:53:33,982 --> 00:53:35,975
}}

811
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,149
Come on. Let's go look
at some hookers, hmm?

812
00:53:38,278 --> 00:53:42,110
Kit Kat Club
be lettin' out 'bout now.

813
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:44,114
74-Will. 330, West 33rd.

814
00:53:44,243 --> 00:53:46,912
Church ofJesus Son, 
for demonic possession.

815
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:49,575
72-Victor, 
you're goin'to 8th and 14th.

816
00:53:49,706 --> 00:53:52,494
On the corner, there's a 40-year-old man
hearin'celebrity voices.

817
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:56,375
76-X ray, take it uptown, 
541 West 54th St,

818
00:53:56,505 --> 00:53:58,830
for the elderly woman
abducted by her cat.

819
00:53:58,966 --> 00:54:01,373
}}

820
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:05,258
Look at these women. 
Can't even tell who's a hooker no more.

821
00:54:05,389 --> 00:54:07,595
Whatever happened to
go-go boots and hot pants?

822
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:09,598
They'll wear anything now.

823
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:12,182
Walk out the house
with whatever they got on.

824
00:54:15,274 --> 00:54:17,729
You got the wrong guy!
Hands off, baby!

825
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,101
The street's not like the E. R.

826
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:24,733
There's no walls, no controls.

827
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:27,903
To make up for that, they try
to teach me how to act without thinking,

828
00:54:28,036 --> 00:54:33,541
like a soldier who can take apart
and reassemble a gun blindfolded.

829
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,703
Kick his ass!
Fuck him up! Fuck him up!

830
00:54:36,837 --> 00:54:39,708
Kick his ass!
Beat the shit out of him, baby!

831
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,714
Beat the shit out of him!

832
00:54:41,842 --> 00:54:43,716
I realized
that my training was useful...

833
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:46,216
in less than ten percent
of the calls,

834
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:50,296
and saving someone's life
was rarer than that.

835
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:52,925
After a while, 
I grew to understand...

836
00:54:53,062 --> 00:54:58,222
that my role was less about saving
lives than about bearing witness.

837
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:00,684
I was a grief mop.

838
00:55:00,819 --> 00:55:03,145
It was enough that
I simply showed up.

839
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,234
- 
- Except with Rose.

840
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:14,205
Shut up!

841
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:18,117
- I'll get ya a glass of water.
Noel, I'm your friend.
-

842
00:55:18,253 --> 00:55:20,923
Come on, calm down.
I'm gonna take you to a spa.

843
00:55:21,048 --> 00:55:23,717
- I'm gonna get you a facial. Shh, shh.
-

844
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:26,131
- 
- Get him in there!

845
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:31,594
Look-Look-Look at that. 
Hmm? Look at that.

846
00:55:31,725 --> 00:55:35,308
Leaves you with no idea what's
underneath. Not even a suggestion.

847
00:55:35,437 --> 00:55:38,059
Could be a skeleton
for all you know.

848
00:55:42,945 --> 00:55:45,780
Yeah, that-that's nice, though. 
Right there. Mm-hmm.

849
00:55:45,906 --> 00:55:49,322
Pullin'back her hood
as we drive by.

850
00:55:49,451 --> 00:55:51,859
See, there's a mystery to it.

851
00:55:51,995 --> 00:55:54,202
- Then she shows ya. 
- She's not a whore, Marcus.

852
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:56,454
We're all whores, Frank.

853
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:59,288
You know what I'm talkin' about?
The way she looked at me.

854
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,623
She wasn't lookin' at you, man.
She was lookin' at me.

855
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:05,923
Why did you kill me, Frank?

856
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:08,459
- I didn't kill you.
- No, you didn't, Frank, and thank you.

857
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:10,469
But there's still a couple hours
left on our shift.

858
00:56:10,597 --> 00:56:13,764
- No, it's not you. It's some...
- You hearin' them voices again?

859
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:16,514
- I just need a drink.
- What-What them voices sayin' to ya?

860
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:18,519
They say, "Kill Marcus!"
Okay?

861
00:56:18,647 --> 00:56:21,434
-
- That ain't funny, Frank.

862
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:23,773
Look, I don't need shock treatments.
I'm not sick, all right?

863
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:25,776
- I just need a drink.
- Okay.

864
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:28,277
62-Young, 
answer the radio. I have a call for you.

865
00:56:29,992 --> 00:56:33,361
I can't wait all night, Young. 
I'm holdin'a priority,

866
00:56:33,495 --> 00:56:35,369
and if you don't answer
I'm gonna knock you outta service.

867
00:56:35,497 --> 00:56:39,162
62-Young is here, baby,
and I'm gonna help you out.

868
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:42,128
Just remember,
you owe me.

869
00:56:42,254 --> 00:56:44,745
You're going to 370 West 98th Street.

870
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:48,333
17-year-old female, cardiac arrest. 
No further information.

871
00:56:48,469 --> 00:56:52,169
- 10-4, hon.
- Why is everything a cardiac arrest?

872
00:56:52,306 --> 00:56:57,015
What happened to chest pain,
difficulty breathing, fractured hands?

873
00:56:57,144 --> 00:56:59,635
Come on, people!

874
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:03,224
Lord Jesus,
help me get through the night.

875
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:06,110
-
- } I can't get over it }

876
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:10,364
} It's so wide
I can't get around it }

877
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:13,195
} Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide }

878
00:57:13,327 --> 00:57:16,078
I hate this block.
Nothin' but crackheads.

879
00:57:16,205 --> 00:57:18,577
- I don't wanna go in there
without the police.
- I'm goin'.

880
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:20,581
It's easier than waitin'.

881
00:57:23,962 --> 00:57:25,836
E. M. S. !

882
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:29,131
- Ambulance!
- Oh, Jesus. My bad back.

883
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:32,675
My feet hurt. 
Damn crackheads.

884
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:36,637
- E. M. S. !
- Hello? E. M. S.

885
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:46,732
Hello?

886
00:57:51,865 --> 00:57:53,692
Please, hurry.

887
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:58,359
Please hurry.
Come this way, please.

888
00:57:58,497 --> 00:58:01,913
- She's over here.
This way. Hurry.
-

889
00:58:07,714 --> 00:58:11,249
My, oh, my, a fat crackhead!
Now, that's a first.

890
00:58:11,385 --> 00:58:16,426
- What's wrong?
- No English. She has
terrible pain in her belly.

891
00:58:16,557 --> 00:58:19,973
- I mean, she's pregnant.
- No, no, that's impossible.
We're virgins.

892
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:23,056
Are you pregnant?
? Estas embarazada?

893
00:58:23,188 --> 00:58:26,225
Can you walk?
? Puedes caminar?

894
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:28,267
- She say she in great pain.
- Thank-Thank you.

895
00:58:28,402 --> 00:58:30,774
Thank you for the translation.
What's your name?

896
00:58:30,904 --> 00:58:34,902
- ? Nombre?
All right, let's have a look.
- Maria! Maria!

897
00:58:37,536 --> 00:58:39,529
You two know each other
a long time?

898
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:41,739
Yeah, two years,
ever since we left the island.

899
00:58:41,874 --> 00:58:44,447
This is a personal question,
but I gotta ask it.

900
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:47,704
- In all that time, you never had sex?
- No, never.

901
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:51,752
Maybe you had a couple of beers
one night last summer.
You know how it works, son.

902
00:58:51,884 --> 00:58:54,588
- No cigarettes, no drugs, no beer.
- No underwear?

903
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,923
- We're virgins!
- Oh, Jesus, we'd better go.
Call for backup!

904
00:58:58,056 --> 00:59:00,761
- It's coming. Hold her down. 
- My God! What the hell is that?

905
00:59:00,893 --> 00:59:03,894
- It's three legs.
- That's too many!

906
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:05,645
-  They're comin'!
- Is she dying?

907
00:59:05,773 --> 00:59:07,646
- She's having a baby. Twins. 
- That's imposible.

908
00:59:07,775 --> 00:59:11,144
It's possible! It's possible!
She's having a baby, okay?

909
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:13,603
It's a miracle.

910
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,607
Contractions stopped.
Help me get her out of here.

911
00:59:18,744 --> 00:59:20,783
Ow!
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

912
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:24,364
- My back. Hold it.
-

913
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,204
-
- All right, look,
let's just put her down.

914
00:59:27,336 --> 00:59:29,957
Put her over here.
Let's just put her down.

915
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:33,173
- You take the first one.
-

916
00:59:39,598 --> 00:59:43,548
It's a boy, Frank.
He looks good.

917
00:59:43,685 --> 00:59:45,892
How's yours?

918
00:59:48,982 --> 00:59:51,022
Open the door!

919
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:53,310
She had a pulse!

920
00:59:53,445 --> 00:59:55,272
Code! Code blue!

921
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:00,232
- We're set up in Two. 
- Jesus Christ. Get her on the monitor.

922
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:02,942
- Where's the paediatric cart?
- It's right here.

923
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,535
- Give me the blade.
How many months, Frank?
- Can't tell.

924
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:08,204
- It was a breech. Twins.
The other seems okay.
- Step back, Frank.

925
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:10,411
Marcus is taking him
and the mother to Maternity.

926
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:13,167
I'm a mother!
I got a daughter! I got rights!

927
01:00:13,298 --> 01:00:15,754
-  Start compression. 
- Give her some Valium!

928
01:00:15,884 --> 01:00:18,969
- Ten mil, stat!
- Flatline. Let's start C. P. R.

929
01:00:19,096 --> 01:00:22,216
- Starting.
- Status?

930
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:26,472
I think I got a pulse. I think.

931
01:00:31,275 --> 01:00:33,232
- Fuck!
- Nothing!

932
01:00:34,987 --> 01:00:36,979
-  Give me an I. V. Line. 
-  Call X ray.

933
01:00:37,114 --> 01:00:39,190
- I. V. 's in. Give me epinephrine. 
- How long has she been down?

934
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:41,234
-  About ten minutes. 
- Call respiratory.

935
01:00:41,368 --> 01:00:45,033
- Excuse me, sir. Can I please
bother you for a cup of water?
- Can we get an X ray here?

936
01:00:45,164 --> 01:00:47,287
- 
- Oh, my God.

937
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,658
- For days, I have eaten
nothing but sand, O Lord.
- Stop compression.

938
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:52,249
- I've waited so long.
- All right, status?

939
01:00:52,379 --> 01:00:54,787
- Can I please get some fucking water?
- Flatline!

940
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:56,833
Jesus Christ!
Who woke that guy up?

941
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:58,841
- Come on.
- I've got nothing.

942
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:01,211
Shit.

943
01:01:01,346 --> 01:01:04,550
Are the parents here?
Someone's gonna have to tell 'em.

944
01:01:12,191 --> 01:01:14,267
Don't give me that look.

945
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:16,939
- What look?
- You know what look.
It's all over your face.

946
01:01:17,071 --> 01:01:19,740
That l-Just-Saved-
A-Little-Baby-Boy look.

947
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:23,115
We just saved a little,
bouncin' baby boy.

948
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:25,366
- Think of it that way.
- I don't wanna hear about it, okay?

949
01:01:25,496 --> 01:01:27,737
That's three jobs for the night.
It's over. Three jobs.

950
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:30,744
Time for a drink.
Six a. m. , the cocktail hour.

951
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:33,449
So, pass the bottle.
I know you're holding.

952
01:01:33,587 --> 01:01:36,505
The bar is now open.

953
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:39,039
I hate gin.

954
01:01:39,176 --> 01:01:41,632
You know, when I had that
little baby in my hands,

955
01:01:41,762 --> 01:01:44,087
I felt like I was
21 again.

956
01:01:44,223 --> 01:01:48,220
Call like that makes me wanna go back
to workin' three nights a week, not two.

957
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:52,681
- You know, start runnin' again,
cut down on my drinkin'.
- I'll drink to that.

958
01:01:52,815 --> 01:01:56,184
Here's to the greatest job
in the world.

959
01:01:58,445 --> 01:02:00,319
The greatest job in the world.

960
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,152
62-Young, I have
priorities holdin'. Pick up the radio.

961
01:02:03,283 --> 01:02:05,157
Don't do it, Marcus.
Please.

962
01:02:05,285 --> 01:02:07,195
Tell her the bus died.
Tell her the radio's not working.

963
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:09,203
Tell her
our backs are out.

964
01:02:09,331 --> 01:02:12,451
Tell her... Tell her we're too drunk
to take any more calls.

965
01:02:12,584 --> 01:02:14,542
Okay?

966
01:02:16,338 --> 01:02:18,414
- Let's take it!
- No!

967
01:02:18,549 --> 01:02:22,546
62-Young, this is Marcus.
Only for you, baby! Only for you!

968
01:02:22,678 --> 01:02:24,552
-
- Keep it to yourself, Young.

969
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,349
Male diff breather, approximately 30. 
West End and 72nd.

970
01:02:27,474 --> 01:02:29,846
10-4, hon.
I'm comin', baby!

971
01:02:29,977 --> 01:02:32,053
Big Daddy Marcus is comin'!

972
01:02:32,187 --> 01:02:34,394
- We comin'! We comin'!
- No!

973
01:02:34,523 --> 01:02:36,183
Lord have mercy!

974
01:02:46,535 --> 01:02:48,409
Thank You, Jesus.

975
01:02:48,537 --> 01:02:51,621
- Are you all right?
- Amen. Thank You, Jesus.

976
01:02:51,749 --> 01:02:54,952
-
- Oh, thank You, Lord.

977
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:57,125
Oh, thank You, Jesus.

978
01:02:59,173 --> 01:03:03,217
That is the last time
you do this to me, Marcus.

979
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:09,296
- Where are you goin', Frank?
- I quit!

980
01:03:09,433 --> 01:03:11,307
I'm through.

981
01:03:11,435 --> 01:03:14,685
Oh, you think just 'cause you quit,
them ghosts gonna quit too?

982
01:03:14,813 --> 01:03:17,387
It don't work
that way, Frank!

983
01:03:17,524 --> 01:03:19,731
I've been there, son!

984
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,481
- You need the Holy Ghost, Frank!
-

985
01:03:22,613 --> 01:03:24,522
The Holy Ghost!

986
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:35,623
Noel.

987
01:03:47,346 --> 01:03:50,347
- What's going on, Griss?
- Your friend there just
untied the water beggar.

988
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:54,424
Griss was comin' out to thank her.
Probably saved Griss a murder charge.

989
01:03:54,561 --> 01:03:56,969
She's having a tough time, though.

990
01:04:28,595 --> 01:04:31,383
Excuse me. You seemed
like you were in trouble.

991
01:04:31,515 --> 01:04:33,508
No, I'm all right. 
I just...

992
01:04:33,642 --> 01:04:36,394
I can't stand seeing
people tied up.

993
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,897
I'm in that waitin' room for hours,
and I'm listenin' to Noel screamin'.

994
01:04:41,024 --> 01:04:43,694
And the only reason that's
he's screamin' is 'cause he's tied up!

995
01:04:46,905 --> 01:04:49,147
- Don't seem so bad to me.
- Don't say that.

996
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:51,489
I almost cut
my father loose too.

997
01:04:51,618 --> 01:04:54,454
You know, one minute they
tell me that he's almost dead.

998
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,581
The next minute, they tell me
he's better and I can go in and...

999
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:01,658
It's killing me
seeing him fight like that.

1000
01:05:10,012 --> 01:05:12,763
Well, since you're here,
maybe, uh,

1001
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:16,424
maybe you could
do me a favour and, uh...

1002
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,143
wait for me outside
this building, 'cause I gotta
go visit a friend who's sick.

1003
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:26,018
Okay.

1004
01:05:28,322 --> 01:05:31,027
I'm only asking you because
this is a dangerous building,

1005
01:05:31,158 --> 01:05:33,530
and there's been some robberies and
a woman was raped not long ago, and...

1006
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,578
This woman I'm seeing, she's gonna
wanna sit and talk with me all day,

1007
01:05:36,705 --> 01:05:38,579
but if I can point to you out the window
and tell her that you're waitin',

1008
01:05:38,707 --> 01:05:40,581
then she'll
let me out quick.

1009
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:42,583
If anything happens,
I'm in 16-M.

1010
01:05:42,711 --> 01:05:44,585
Maybe I should
come up with you.

1011
01:05:44,713 --> 01:05:47,204
If I'm not back in 15 minutes
just hit the buzzer, 
and that way she'll let me go.

1012
01:05:47,341 --> 01:05:49,215
If that's what's gonna happen.
I'll come with you.

1013
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:51,217
I'm okay. I'm just
visiting a friend who's sick.

1014
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:55,968
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

1015
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,057
You asked me not to come.

1016
01:05:58,185 --> 01:06:00,474
Promise you won't
go inside.

1017
01:06:00,604 --> 01:06:02,976
Fifteen minutes.

1018
01:06:03,107 --> 01:06:05,479
You know, everyone
at that hospital's crazy!

1019
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:08,943
I'm going crazy too.
You understand?

1020
01:06:09,071 --> 01:06:11,562
I just have to...

1021
01:06:11,698 --> 01:06:16,693
I just have to relax a little
and not feel so guilty all the time.

1022
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:19,320
We can still go back.

1023
01:06:19,456 --> 01:06:22,078
I'll walk you home.
You sleep for a couple hours.

1024
01:06:22,209 --> 01:06:24,083
Watch some TV.
Take a bath.

1025
01:06:24,211 --> 01:06:26,085
Don't be such a cop.

1026
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:32,006
If you have any doubts
about this, it's my fault.

1027
01:06:32,136 --> 01:06:34,709
You go on home.
Really.

1028
01:06:34,847 --> 01:06:37,219
I'm fine.
Thanks.

1029
01:06:38,684 --> 01:06:40,807
I don't need you.

1030
01:06:40,936 --> 01:06:44,601
- Hi.
- Hey, Cy, guess who's here.

1031
01:07:06,795 --> 01:07:08,669
Can I help you?

1032
01:07:08,797 --> 01:07:11,419
Mary Burke.
She's a friend.

1033
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:13,424
She's not here.

1034
01:07:13,552 --> 01:07:15,426
- Wait a minute. You can't go in.
- }}

1035
01:07:15,554 --> 01:07:17,428
- Kanita?
- Hey!

1036
01:07:17,556 --> 01:07:19,430
- Hey, Cy!
- Be cool. Be cool.

1037
01:07:19,558 --> 01:07:22,678
- It's all good.
- He looks like a cop.

1038
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:27,105
No, he ain't no cop. You're a medic,
right? I'm Cy. Cy Coates.

1039
01:07:27,232 --> 01:07:29,142
Frank Pierce.

1040
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:31,434
Mary said you might
be coming over.

1041
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:35,864
- Where is she?
- Sleepin', brother, in the back.

1042
01:07:35,991 --> 01:07:37,865
She asked me
to pick her up,

1043
01:07:37,993 --> 01:07:40,235
- go out for a movie and a malt
and bring her right home.
-

1044
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,577
I know, I know.
I know.

1045
01:07:42,706 --> 01:07:46,918
- But she told me to tell you she
wants to crash here a few hours.
-

1046
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:50,709
See, it's terrible
about her father and everything.

1047
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:54,504
- }} 
- I better just go in and see her.

1048
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:57,920
Frank, see,
I call this the Oasis.

1049
01:07:58,055 --> 01:08:00,760
It's a refuge from
the world out there.

1050
01:08:00,891 --> 01:08:03,464
You wanna come in here,
relax, sit down.

1051
01:08:03,602 --> 01:08:05,844
It's all right.
Brother, she is sound asleep.

1052
01:08:05,979 --> 01:08:07,853
She ain't gonna know
any difference.

1053
01:08:11,443 --> 01:08:13,317
No, I'm gonna go see her.

1054
01:08:13,445 --> 01:08:17,988
Well, did you know two people got shot
in this buildin' last week?

1055
01:08:18,117 --> 01:08:21,283
A priest got robbed
by ten-year-olds across the street.

1056
01:08:21,412 --> 01:08:24,662
Oh, brother, be careful. 
That's the Tiger.

1057
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:27,660
Lady's down the hall.

1058
01:08:27,793 --> 01:08:29,702
Clean up that nose,
brother.

1059
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:35,290
Welcome to
Dayrise Enterprises, Frank.

1060
01:08:35,426 --> 01:08:37,584
Stress-free factory.

1061
01:08:46,395 --> 01:08:48,933
Mary. Mary.

1062
01:08:49,064 --> 01:08:52,018
- We have to get going.
-

1063
01:08:52,151 --> 01:08:54,024
She asked for something
to help her sleep, brother.

1064
01:08:54,153 --> 01:08:56,478
Mary, we really have to go.

1065
01:08:56,613 --> 01:09:00,563
-
- Whoa, Frank, she suffered
enough, all right?

1066
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:04,200
Now, she's gonna be fine.
I promise.

1067
01:09:04,329 --> 01:09:06,999
Come on, Frank.

1068
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:16,088
Now, I'm always
interested in people
with stressful occupations.

1069
01:09:16,216 --> 01:09:21,092
Now, bein' a paramedic, that's about
as stressful as I can imagine.

1070
01:09:21,221 --> 01:09:23,843
Go ahead, take a seat. 
Sit down.

1071
01:09:23,974 --> 01:09:27,141
Tell me some war stories. 
You know, what's it like?

1072
01:09:28,812 --> 01:09:30,686
Got a beer?

1073
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:33,139
Oh, that shit
is poison, Frank.

1074
01:09:33,275 --> 01:09:35,149
We don't have
alcohol around here.

1075
01:09:35,277 --> 01:09:38,978
What you need
is one of these.

1076
01:09:48,123 --> 01:09:50,793
Did-Did you give Mary
something called Red Death?

1077
01:09:52,836 --> 01:09:56,501
- 
- Excuse me?

1078
01:09:58,509 --> 01:10:00,382
Red Death.

1079
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:05,631
Tell me something, Frank.

1080
01:10:08,519 --> 01:10:12,267
Does killing your clients sound like
good business sense to you? Hmm?

1081
01:10:12,397 --> 01:10:16,478
See, the kids sellin'that Red Death
arejust tryin'to make a quick buck.

1082
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:19,730
They don't got no respect for me
or the work I done in this community.

1083
01:10:19,863 --> 01:10:23,315
But don't worry.
They're gonna be taken care of.

1084
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:26,155
I got Tiger workin'on it.

1085
01:10:26,286 --> 01:10:28,991
- I should be going. I just quit.
- Oh, look.

1086
01:10:29,123 --> 01:10:31,792
Sleep is all
stress reduction.

1087
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:34,918
All right?
Here.

1088
01:10:35,045 --> 01:10:39,090
Now, if you take one of these,
sleep for two hours...

1089
01:10:39,216 --> 01:10:41,837
That's all you need.

1090
01:10:47,558 --> 01:10:49,431
Why do you think
I'm tellin' you this, Frank?

1091
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,552
For my health?

1092
01:10:51,687 --> 01:10:54,937
Now, brother, you gotta look at yourself
in the mirror, all right?

1093
01:10:55,065 --> 01:10:57,272
Kanita.

1094
01:10:57,401 --> 01:11:00,651
Would you get our new friend
here a glass of water, please?

1095
01:11:01,738 --> 01:11:04,064
Oh, you're so fine.

1096
01:11:13,459 --> 01:11:15,451
Is this what you gave Mary?

1097
01:11:15,586 --> 01:11:18,587
Yep, that's the stuff.
I call it the Red Lion.

1098
01:11:18,714 --> 01:11:21,205
It's very king-of-the-jungle,
"Makuna matata, " all that.

1099
01:11:21,341 --> 01:11:23,749
There's no language. 
Just brute power.

1100
01:11:23,886 --> 01:11:26,127
But, see,

1101
01:11:26,263 --> 01:11:31,258
you just ain't gonna believe
how relaxin' that shit
really is, all right?

1102
01:11:31,393 --> 01:11:33,765
}}

1103
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:58,248
- I guess I'll be going.
- Just relax.

1104
01:11:58,378 --> 01:12:01,166
You at the Oasis now.

1105
01:12:01,298 --> 01:12:03,207
All right?

1106
01:12:06,637 --> 01:12:08,713
Take my pulse.

1107
01:12:16,105 --> 01:12:19,390
It's good, isn't it?

1108
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:21,434
It's perfect.

1109
01:12:21,568 --> 01:12:24,688
It's two beats per minute.

1110
01:12:24,822 --> 01:12:27,360
I knew it.

1111
01:12:27,491 --> 01:12:29,400
I was wrong about you.

1112
01:12:31,829 --> 01:12:33,786
You're not so bad.

1113
01:12:59,273 --> 01:13:02,274
}}

1114
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:05,402
}}

1115
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:08,102
} Who are you }

1116
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,398
} I am the Japanese sandman }

1117
01:13:10,534 --> 01:13:14,282
} You lookee like

- You're in the stomach.
- You sure?

1134
01:15:17,661 --> 01:15:19,784
You're in the stomach again.

1135
01:15:19,913 --> 01:15:22,451
- You're in the stomach again. 
Let me try. 
- One more time.

1136
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:27,787
- Rose.
- Huh?

1137
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:30,673
My name, Rose.

1138
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,048
- Stomach again.
- No way!

1139
01:15:39,183 --> 01:15:41,555
No pulse.
Let me try.

1140
01:15:44,563 --> 01:15:47,398
No pulse!
No pulse, goddam it!

1141
01:15:50,527 --> 01:15:54,442
- Frank! Frank! Take it easy!
Okay, what happened?
- }}

1142
01:15:54,573 --> 01:15:58,191
- He flipped out!
- All right, now, Frank...
Frank, be cool, my brother.

1143
01:15:58,327 --> 01:16:01,078
-
- You're havin' what you call
a paradoxical reaction.

1144
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:04,040
-  He's psycho!
- Listen to me, Frank.

1145
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:06,918
Frank, where are you goin'?
You're makin'a mistake.

1146
01:16:07,044 --> 01:16:10,744
Yeah, you go. Okay, that's good. 
You go in there.

1147
01:16:10,881 --> 01:16:14,926
You go in there, lie down. 
Get some sleep, whatever.

1148
01:16:19,556 --> 01:16:22,178
Hey. Look.

1149
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:24,598
- Cy, you want me to stop this?
- No, Tiger, it's all right.

1150
01:16:24,728 --> 01:16:26,602
- You sure?
- It's cool. Be cool. Let him go.

1151
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,853
Let him go.

1152
01:16:28,982 --> 01:16:31,355
Put me down!

1153
01:16:34,196 --> 01:16:36,604
Frank, you are makin'
a serious mistake, my man.

1154
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:40,489
She's just gonna come back. 
Oh, and Frank, you owe me ten dollars.

1155
01:16:44,957 --> 01:16:47,708
Put me down.

1156
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:55,875
Get off!

1157
01:16:57,928 --> 01:17:00,929
- 
Did you and Cy have a nice talk?
- Let go!

1158
01:17:01,056 --> 01:17:04,639
Did he tell you about
Dayrise Enterprises helping people?

1159
01:17:06,103 --> 01:17:08,724
Well, I've seen him
hurt people.

1160
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:14,898
Why are you following me?

1161
01:17:16,113 --> 01:17:18,319
Because you
can barely walk.

1162
01:17:22,995 --> 01:17:28,202
You remember Noel from the other night?
How Noel is now?

1163
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,409
He wasn't always like that.

1164
01:17:31,795 --> 01:17:35,081
He was my brother's
best friend.

1165
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:38,833
Cy or Tiger or one of those goons
put a bullet in Noel's head.

1166
01:17:38,969 --> 01:17:40,843
He was in a coma
for three months.

1167
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:44,589
He's been crazy
ever since.

1168
01:17:45,684 --> 01:17:47,558
This is...

1169
01:17:47,686 --> 01:17:49,928
my building.

1170
01:17:59,156 --> 01:18:01,481
What is it with you?
You wanna help me?

1171
01:18:01,617 --> 01:18:05,151
You feel sorry for me?
Well, keep it to yourself.

1172
01:18:05,287 --> 01:18:07,956
I just need to sit down
for a minute.

1173
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:11,332
- You wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
-

1174
01:18:16,131 --> 01:18:18,753
Hi! Hi.

1175
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:23,084
I've been clean for two years.
No drugs. I got a job.

1176
01:18:23,222 --> 01:18:25,891
I paint when I'm at home.
I don't bother anybody.

1177
01:18:26,016 --> 01:18:29,634
Then all this shit happens.
Oh, no, you don't.

1178
01:18:31,855 --> 01:18:33,895
Hey, you can't stay here.
Come on.

1179
01:18:34,024 --> 01:18:36,230
Get up.

1180
01:18:52,459 --> 01:18:55,626
Hello. I'm Frank.

1181
01:18:55,754 --> 01:18:57,747
Mary's friend.

1182
01:18:57,881 --> 01:19:01,167
A very close friend
who loves animals.

1183
01:19:09,309 --> 01:19:11,183
Hello?

1184
01:19:21,238 --> 01:19:24,939
I washed my face
with three kinds of soap,

1185
01:19:25,075 --> 01:19:27,862
each smelling
like a different season.

1186
01:19:27,995 --> 01:19:31,245
It felt good to be
in a woman's room again,

1187
01:19:31,373 --> 01:19:36,415
especially a woman who wasn't comatose
or severely disabled.

1188
01:19:36,545 --> 01:19:39,629
I felt like perhaps
I had turned a corner...

1189
01:19:39,756 --> 01:19:42,045
like I saved someone...

1190
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:44,215
though I didn't know who.

1191
01:19:47,014 --> 01:19:49,137
Hey, Pierce.

1192
01:19:49,266 --> 01:19:51,722
You're late, I know it,
but I can't fire you today.

1193
01:19:51,852 --> 01:19:55,517
- I got nobody to ride
66-X ray with Wolls.
- No.

1194
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,565
I got a form for you to make out about
the accident when you get some time.

1195
01:19:58,692 --> 01:20:01,444
Come here, kid.
Come here.

1196
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:04,026
Look, I'm gonna fire you tomorrow.
I promise you.

1197
01:20:04,156 --> 01:20:06,647
What-What if there is
no tomorrow?

1198
01:20:06,784 --> 01:20:08,990
Will you get out of here
before I give you a big hug!

1199
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:12,571
"No tomorrow. "
I love that kid.

1200
01:20:12,706 --> 01:20:17,451
}}

1201
01:20:17,586 --> 01:20:20,622
Frank. Hey, man.
What do you know?

1202
01:20:20,756 --> 01:20:23,247
You and me again, tonight.
The Rough Riders,

1203
01:20:23,383 --> 01:20:26,883
tearin' up the streets
just like old times, huh?

1204
01:20:28,305 --> 01:20:30,381
- 
- This old bus is a warrior, Frank.

1205
01:20:30,516 --> 01:20:32,389
Just like us.

1206
01:20:32,518 --> 01:20:35,519
I have tried to kill him...
many times,

1207
01:20:35,646 --> 01:20:37,852
and he will not die.

1208
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:40,603
I have great respect for that.

1209
01:20:40,734 --> 01:20:44,150
- } You can't put your arm
around a memory }
- Okay.

1210
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:47,529
} You can't put your arm
around a memory }

1211
01:20:50,452 --> 01:20:53,122
Get up, right now!
Get up! Cool it!

1212
01:20:53,247 --> 01:20:56,366
I already told you you can't go
in there! Didn't you hear me?

1213
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,539
Don't make me take off
my sunglasses!

1214
01:20:58,669 --> 01:21:01,539
- Good morning, Griss.
- We're full up here tonight, Frank.

1215
01:21:01,672 --> 01:21:04,293
Get the hell out of here.
Step back! Step back!

1216
01:21:27,614 --> 01:21:30,781
Go to the bank, 
boy. Take out everything you can.

1217
01:21:33,328 --> 01:21:35,202
Mr Burke?

1218
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,122
I'm going. 
I've had enough.

1219
01:21:45,132 --> 01:21:48,002
- You do it.
- I can't reach. You're taller.

1220
01:21:48,135 --> 01:21:50,970
-  Don't do it!
- He's getting better.

1221
01:21:51,096 --> 01:21:52,970
- Better than what? It doesn't matter!
- Better than what?

1222
01:21:53,098 --> 01:21:55,257
- Why not?
- The family wants us to keep him alive.

1223
01:21:55,392 --> 01:21:57,266
The wife wants to believe in miracles.
We keep him alive.

1224
01:21:57,394 --> 01:21:59,601
Shock him, Frank. He'll come back.
He always comes back.

1225
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:07,067
Clear!

1226
01:22:07,196 --> 01:22:09,153
-  You son of a bitch!
- Nothing. Shock him again.

1227
01:22:09,281 --> 01:22:11,155
Don't do it!

1228
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:17,826
-  Son of a bitch!
-  Do it again.

1229
01:22:17,956 --> 01:22:20,910
Don't do it!

1230
01:22:21,043 --> 01:22:23,166
Frank!

1231
01:22:23,295 --> 01:22:26,462
- Jesus! Move! Move!
-

1232
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:28,464
Clear!

1233
01:22:28,592 --> 01:22:31,261
Hey, boy. Where you goin', Frank?

1234
01:22:31,386 --> 01:22:33,046
Hey, Frank!

1235
01:22:33,806 --> 01:22:36,641
}}

1236
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:41,637
Frank? Frank, what the hell
you doin' back there?

1237
01:22:41,772 --> 01:22:44,144
I'm sick, Tom.
I need a cure.

1238
01:22:44,274 --> 01:22:48,142
Vitamin B cocktail, followed
by an amp of glucose...

1239
01:22:48,278 --> 01:22:51,279
and a drop of adrenaline.

1240
01:22:51,406 --> 01:22:54,076
It's not as good as beer,
but it's all I got.

1241
01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:57,784
Come on, Frank. There's blood spillin'
in the streets. Let's go have some fun.

1242
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:03,415
Watch out.

1243
01:23:04,878 --> 01:23:07,583
You all right?

1244
01:23:07,714 --> 01:23:10,087
These are hard times, Tom.

1245
01:23:10,217 --> 01:23:12,174
Yeah, it's great,
isn't it?

1246
01:23:12,302 --> 01:23:14,840
It's great to be drunk.
Sobriety's killing me.

1247
01:23:14,972 --> 01:23:17,344
Look up in the sky, Frank.
It's a full moon.

1248
01:23:17,474 --> 01:23:19,882
Blood's gonna run tonight.
I can feel it.

1249
01:23:20,018 --> 01:23:22,723
Our mission:
To save lives.

1250
01:23:22,855 --> 01:23:25,346
Our mission is coffee, Tom.

1251
01:23:25,482 --> 01:23:28,567
A shot of the bull.
Puerto Rican espresso.

1252
01:23:29,653 --> 01:23:31,859
10-4.
El Toro de Oro.

1253
01:23:31,989 --> 01:23:33,898
Blast off!

1254
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:45,333
This cure's not working, Tom.
Maybe we should go back to the hospital.

1255
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:47,702
Oh, come on. Don't worry.
Tom will take care of ya.

1256
01:23:47,838 --> 01:23:50,376
Put your head out the window.
Get some of that nice clean air.

1257
01:23:50,507 --> 01:23:53,259
- Come on, stop it!
- 
Okay, units, it's suicide hour.

1258
01:23:53,385 --> 01:23:56,754
14th and 7th. A man with a noose around
his neck and nothin'to hang it on.

1259
01:23:56,889 --> 01:23:59,759
66-X ray, don't even think about getting
coffee. I have a call for you too.

1260
01:23:59,892 --> 01:24:03,426
66-Exterminator here.
We like our coffee bloody.

1261
01:24:03,562 --> 01:24:06,433
This better be good.
My partner's dying to help someone.

1262
01:24:06,565 --> 01:24:10,432
You're in luck, X. 
Your patient awaits you
with bleeding wrists in the tunnel.

1263
01:24:10,569 --> 01:24:12,941
- 10-4.
- Tom, where are the Band-Aids?

1264
01:24:13,071 --> 01:24:16,654
- This is an ambulance, isn't it?
- Be cool, man.

1265
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:18,942
- Look out!
-

1266
01:24:42,392 --> 01:24:44,800
He does this every time
he gets drunk.

1267
01:24:44,895 --> 01:24:47,137
- You smell that?
- But he hates when I call you guys.

1268
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:49,270
What the hell's
goin' on here?

1269
01:24:49,399 --> 01:24:51,273
You gotta take him
to the hospital.

1270
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:54,272
- He tried to kill himself.
- You guys got any coffee?

1271
01:24:54,404 --> 01:24:57,026
- Show him your wrist.
Go ahead, show him.
- All right, come on.

1272
01:24:57,157 --> 01:25:00,242
Let me see. 
It's not even bleeding.

1273
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:02,942
He does this all the time. 
He ain't right.

1274
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,452
It was bleedin' before. He kept spilling
his beer. I gave him mouth-to-mouth.

1275
01:25:05,582 --> 01:25:07,658
You're lucky
you didn't kill him.

1276
01:25:07,793 --> 01:25:11,458
I wanna hear it straight
from the Looney Tunes himself.

1277
01:25:11,588 --> 01:25:13,628
Try to bump yourself off?

1278
01:25:13,757 --> 01:25:15,833
Yes.

1279
01:25:15,968 --> 01:25:18,256
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so?

1280
01:25:18,387 --> 01:25:21,423
Come on.
I'm gonna fix you up.

1281
01:25:21,557 --> 01:25:23,798
Come on, Frank.

1282
01:25:23,934 --> 01:25:27,054
Sir, I am going to give you
some medicine that is still
very experimental.

1283
01:25:27,187 --> 01:25:31,267
It's from NASA. And although our
astronauts have been using it for years,

1284
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,523
we are the very
first service to try it.

1285
01:25:33,652 --> 01:25:37,436
Now, I am gonna put this patch
on your forehead, like this.

1286
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:40,739
And in about a minute,
you will have to relax.

1287
01:25:40,868 --> 01:25:43,537
You will lose all
your suicidal feelings.

1288
01:25:43,662 --> 01:25:47,612
It's very important that you wear
the patch for at least 24 hours.

1289
01:25:47,749 --> 01:25:49,872
And keep checking the mirror.

1290
01:25:50,002 --> 01:25:54,580
If the patch turns green, 
you have to see a doctor immediately.

1291
01:25:54,715 --> 01:25:57,585
The side effects could be fatal.
Okay?

1292
01:25:57,718 --> 01:26:00,505
- Okay, now, what did I say?
What colour?
- Uh, clean.

1293
01:26:00,637 --> 01:26:02,677
- Clean.
- "Cream. " You said "cream. "

1294
01:26:02,806 --> 01:26:04,715
- Cream. Green.
- Green.

1295
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,807
This, uh...
Excuse me.

1296
01:26:08,854 --> 01:26:12,852
This is the worst suicide attempt
I've ever seen.

1297
01:26:12,983 --> 01:26:16,684
Can you feel that pulse?
Here? That's where you cut.

1298
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:20,355
And it's not across.
It's down, like so.

1299
01:26:20,491 --> 01:26:22,364
Here.
Take it.

1300
01:26:22,493 --> 01:26:25,659
- I can't. I can't.
- What?

1301
01:26:25,788 --> 01:26:27,864
Oh, I see.

1302
01:26:27,998 --> 01:26:30,489
With all the poor people
of this city...

1303
01:26:30,626 --> 01:26:33,033
who wanted only to live
and were viciously murdered,

1304
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:35,922
you have the nerve
to sit here...

1305
01:26:36,048 --> 01:26:38,005
wanting to die
and not go through with it?

1306
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:40,007
-
- You make me sick!

1307
01:26:40,135 --> 01:26:43,136
- Take it! Take it!
-

1308
01:26:49,311 --> 01:26:51,553
We cured him!

1309
01:26:51,688 --> 01:26:55,982
There's nothin' we can't do
if we just work together.

1310
01:26:57,653 --> 01:26:59,776
I told you to stop
for coffee.

1311
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:04,574
}}

1312
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:07,027
- Thanks a lot.
-

1313
01:27:07,162 --> 01:27:10,199
It sounds like they're trying to
clean up the bus terminal tonight.

1314
01:27:16,672 --> 01:27:20,290
Hello?
Major Tom to Frank.

1315
01:27:20,425 --> 01:27:22,502
Time to just say "no. "

1316
01:27:33,272 --> 01:27:35,976
}}

1317
01:27:36,108 --> 01:27:39,311
- Where you goin'?
- Come on, Tom, the city's burning.

1318
01:27:43,615 --> 01:27:45,573
} He's in love
with the rock and roll world }

1319

1320

JanieJones' world }

1321

his boring job, no }

1322
01:27:52,332 --> 01:27:54,574

1323
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:56,667

1324

what he has to do }

1327
01:28:03,385 --> 01:28:07,335
} He knows he's gonna
have fun with you }

1328
01:28:07,473 --> 01:28:10,142
What are you doin'?

1329
01:28:10,267 --> 01:28:12,509
I'm driving
out of myself.

1330
01:28:12,644 --> 01:28:16,428
- Uh, these brakes are shot.
- I've taken that into consideration.

1331
01:28:16,565 --> 01:28:19,234
- Frank? Frank?
- Yeah?

1332
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:21,601
Are you okay?

1333
01:28:21,737 --> 01:28:24,228
Never felt better in my life.
How are you?

1334
01:28:24,364 --> 01:28:26,322
- I'm good.
- Good.

1335
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,988
66-X ray. X ray-66.

1336
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:32,488
- X.
- First of all, I want you to know
how sorry I am about this.

1337
01:28:32,623 --> 01:28:36,917
I've always liked you two. A unit above
none. A legend in its own lunchtime.

1338
01:28:37,044 --> 01:28:40,128
So it hurts me deeply to do this, 
but I have no choice.

1339
01:28:40,255 --> 01:28:42,331
You must go to
48th and Broadway.

1340
01:28:42,466 --> 01:28:46,879
In front of a liquor store you'll find
a 50-year-old male, unconscious.

1341
01:28:47,012 --> 01:28:49,337
It says here, 
"Man smells real bad. "

1342
01:28:49,473 --> 01:28:52,924
- Do I have to say more?
- But you've said too much already.

1343
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:55,515
- Mr Oh!
- It's early for him.

1344
01:28:55,646 --> 01:28:57,519
It's all right. We're not meant
to do Oh tonight.

1345
01:28:57,648 --> 01:29:01,064
Something's gonna happen.
I can feel it!

1346
01:29:01,193 --> 01:29:03,067
Sergeant, 
put me on the back of that jumper.

1347
01:29:03,195 --> 01:29:05,069
E. M. S. To Central.
What was that call?

1348
01:29:05,197 --> 01:29:08,114
- E. M. S. , a jumper.
A shooting. West Side Projects.
- 10-4.

1349
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,649
One minute out.
Let's go.

1350
01:29:10,786 --> 01:29:13,455
Somebody's gonna kill themselves.
Let's go. I don't wanna miss it.

1351
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:16,332
66. 
66-X ray, level one emergency.

1352
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:18,332
Level one emergency. 
I need units. I need units.

1353
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,417
We got fires in the hole. 
8th and Broadway.

1354
01:29:20,546 --> 01:29:23,333
Shots being fired outside
the Dynamite Club. 13th and 6th.

1355
01:29:23,465 --> 01:29:26,550
Fired workers are shooting each other
at the post office. Where are my units?

1356
01:29:26,677 --> 01:29:29,084
Where are my units?
6- 6? 6-6 X-ray?

1357
01:29:29,221 --> 01:29:32,886
Level one emergency! Level one
emergency! Where are my units?

1358
01:29:33,016 --> 01:29:36,468
The dead are rising, but you can't tell
their faces from the smoke!

1359
01:29:36,603 --> 01:29:39,177
Somebody holdin'him
or somethin'? Is he trying to jump?

1360
01:29:39,314 --> 01:29:41,188
Go on home, sinners!

1361
01:29:41,316 --> 01:29:43,439
Go back to your opium pipes
and whisky bottles!

1362
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:46,238
- What's with the rabbis?
- They love to hang around with us.

1363
01:29:46,363 --> 01:29:49,483
They offered us money for a new rig, 
so I deputized them.

1364
01:29:49,616 --> 01:29:52,321
Back to your slot machines,

1365
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,529
ribbed condoms, Mexican divorces,

1366
01:29:54,663 --> 01:29:56,572
your sex clubs and martinis.

1367
01:29:56,707 --> 01:30:00,574
Back to your hot oil wrestling,
Washington lobbying, organ donation.

1368
01:30:00,711 --> 01:30:04,329
- What do we bring?
- Better bring it all.

1369
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:06,338
You guys grab all the gear.
Let's go.

1370
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:10,167
- This guy a jumper?
- Got a call for shots fired
on the 16th floor.

1371
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,795
- The jumper called right after.
- He landed on 14.

1372
01:30:16,226 --> 01:30:18,100
I'm goin' to 16.

1373
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:43,500
He must've left the tub on.

1374
01:30:43,629 --> 01:30:45,871
}}

1375
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,119
That's it.
Nobody else home.

1376
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,604
Aye, that's gotta hurt.

1377
01:31:45,732 --> 01:31:48,650
-  Tell him not to move. 
- I'm going down to 14.

1378
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,327
Forget that thing.
Go with the torch. Go.

1379
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:04,830
Hey, get this, Frank.
We got two patients.

1380
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,834
Number one:
The scarecrow outside.

1381
01:32:06,962 --> 01:32:08,836
Number two:
The big fellah.

1382
01:32:08,964 --> 01:32:11,502
Misses the railing but breaks
both legs on the balcony.

1383
01:32:11,633 --> 01:32:14,303
Then he throws himself
through the glass window.

1384
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:18,639
Then he starts crawling
that way and, uh, he passed out.

1385
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:25,094
- Well, he's our shish kebab
for the night then.
- Gonna have to torch him.

1386
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:28,148
- How's he doing?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna work on Sleeping Beauty.

1387
01:32:29,902 --> 01:32:31,775
Hey, big guy!

1388
01:32:31,904 --> 01:32:34,905
Either you jump or you get shot.
What are ya gonna do?

1389
01:32:35,032 --> 01:32:36,906
- I think I'd rather get shot. 
-

1390
01:32:37,034 --> 01:32:38,943
Drug dealers.

1391
01:32:43,207 --> 01:32:47,833
- Does that hurt?
- No! No. No.

1392
01:32:49,671 --> 01:32:52,376
I don't think you're cut
through any major arteries.

1393
01:32:52,508 --> 01:32:55,711
We have to get you off this thing
without setting off bleeding.

1394
01:32:55,844 --> 01:32:57,837
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1395
01:32:57,971 --> 01:33:01,755
- I'll take your blood pressure.
-

1396
01:33:01,892 --> 01:33:05,142
- All right, I'm in. You in?
- I am now.

1397
01:33:08,941 --> 01:33:12,025
If he happens to fall, I don't think
anybody'd be cryin' too much.

1398
01:33:14,154 --> 01:33:17,072
They're gonna torch the fence. You're
gonna feel the metal getting warm.

1399
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,073
Maybe very warm.

1400
01:33:19,201 --> 01:33:21,277
I can't hold my head up anymore.

1401
01:33:21,411 --> 01:33:23,653
Hold this.

1402
01:33:27,209 --> 01:33:29,451
Jump! Let him fuckin'go!

1403
01:33:29,586 --> 01:33:31,875
- Let him die!
- Let him go!

1404
01:33:32,005 --> 01:33:34,496
So, Frank.

1405
01:33:34,633 --> 01:33:38,583
Am I gonna live?

1406
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,390
- You're gonna live.
- Frank.

1407
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:44,220
That ten dollars
you owe me?

1408
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:46,509
- Yeah?
- Keep it.

1409
01:33:46,645 --> 01:33:49,218
I've been thinkin'
about things, you know?

1410
01:33:49,356 --> 01:33:53,057
Oh, you guys gave me lots of time
to meditate on the future.

1411
01:33:53,193 --> 01:33:55,067
What'd you do, huh?
Stop for Chinese on the way over here?

1412
01:33:55,195 --> 01:33:58,529
I was tired.
I needed a coffee.

1413
01:34:00,492 --> 01:34:02,366
What about Kanita?

1414
01:34:02,494 --> 01:34:04,617
Dead.

1415
01:34:09,293 --> 01:34:13,955
That's, uh...
That's too bad.

1416
01:34:14,089 --> 01:34:17,423
Hmm.
See, Frank,

1417
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:21,050
make some money,
fine-lookin' lady on your arm,

1418
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:23,718
then everybody wants
to take a piece.

1419
01:34:23,849 --> 01:34:26,933
Yeah,
there's some kid...

1420
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:29,516
who I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes,
comes to the Oasis,

1421
01:34:29,646 --> 01:34:31,686
starts shootin' at me.

1422
01:34:31,815 --> 01:34:36,109
The Red Death Gang.
Bunch of 12-year-olds.

1423
01:34:37,613 --> 01:34:40,068
I thought I could make it
on the balcony, like Tiger.

1424
01:34:41,575 --> 01:34:44,695
But he's fat. Falls faster.
That's why.

1425
01:34:44,828 --> 01:34:47,319
I'm tryin' to watch my weight,
and look what happens.

1426
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:53,367
Goddam, that's hot!

1427
01:34:53,504 --> 01:34:56,707
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1428
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:59,545
You can't kill me,
duck-ass kids!

1429
01:34:59,676 --> 01:35:03,259
Oh, yeah.|

1430
01:35:03,388 --> 01:35:07,718
Ooh. Look at that.
Look at that.

1431
01:35:07,851 --> 01:35:12,229
Look at that.
Hey, isn't that beautiful?

1432
01:35:12,356 --> 01:35:14,977
Isn't that beautiful?

1433
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:21,905
Oh, when the fires
start to fall,

1434
01:35:22,032 --> 01:35:25,116
them that's strongest
rule it all!

1435
01:35:25,244 --> 01:35:27,117
Oh!

1436
01:35:27,246 --> 01:35:31,540
I love this city!

1437
01:35:53,897 --> 01:35:57,480
Good thing we clipped you in,
huh, Frank?

1438
01:35:57,609 --> 01:35:59,519
What about me?
Who buckled me in?

1439
01:35:59,653 --> 01:36:01,527
- I thought you did.
- Nah, I thought you did.

1440
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:03,529
- I'm sorry about that, sir.
- Yeah, right.

1441
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:06,611
Aah!
Stop jerkin'my pole!

1442
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:13,911
l-I got a fence up my ass, all
right? I need something for the pain.

1443
01:36:14,042 --> 01:36:15,916
We'll get you another sedative.

1444
01:36:16,044 --> 01:36:19,129
And somebody'll be by to take you to the
O. R. , hopefully sometime this morning.

1445
01:36:19,256 --> 01:36:21,332
Hopefully?
Hopefully sometime this morning?

1446
01:36:21,467 --> 01:36:24,218
Oh, Frank. 
Frank. Psst.

1447
01:36:26,388 --> 01:36:28,262
You saved my life.

1448
01:36:30,225 --> 01:36:32,301
Yeah, I know.

1449
01:36:32,436 --> 01:36:35,141
Nurse Crupp, we're gonna need
some Valium here. He's waking up again.

1450
01:36:35,272 --> 01:36:37,893
- Where's that Valium?
- Coming.

1451
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:42,568
Frank, give me a hand over here.
I gotta get something between his teeth.

1452
01:36:42,696 --> 01:36:46,231
- 
Don't! Don't do it!
- Valium's in.

1453
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:51,160
How many times
have you shocked him tonight?

1454
01:36:51,288 --> 01:36:54,657
Fourteen. Finally got him
a room up in I. C. U.

1455
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:57,164
He should be up there
in a couple hours.

1456
01:36:57,294 --> 01:37:01,671
What are you gonna do,
just have somebody follow him
around with a defibrillator?

1457
01:37:01,799 --> 01:37:04,586
That's a good one, Frank. No,
but we might surgically implant one...

1458
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:06,711
around the shoulder over here,
'bout the size of my thumb.

1459
01:37:06,845 --> 01:37:09,336
Two electrodes
connected to the heart.

1460
01:37:09,473 --> 01:37:11,347
Sends a shock
whenever he needs it.

1461
01:37:11,475 --> 01:37:16,018
Or we could just send him home with a
defibrillator. He could do it himself.

1462
01:37:23,612 --> 01:37:26,613
} I know it ain't funny
It ain't funny at all, baby }

1463
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:37,914
} To land in
the cool room, man }

1464
01:37:41,463 --> 01:37:44,168
Look.

1465
01:37:44,299 --> 01:37:49,376
Last night I was weak,
and it won't happen again.

1466
01:37:49,513 --> 01:37:54,305
All that shit I was sayin'
was just 'cause I was stoned.

1467
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:57,303
- Just forget it.
- No problem.

1468
01:37:59,356 --> 01:38:01,764
Thanks for letting me crash.

1469
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:04,687
It was the best sleep
I've had in months.

1470
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:08,070
I used some of your soap.

1471
01:38:08,198 --> 01:38:10,523
Did you see my father?

1472
01:38:13,287 --> 01:38:15,410
You know, the doctor said
that, uh,

1473
01:38:15,539 --> 01:38:17,994
that his brain's
startin' to come around.

1474
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:21,292
They're just waitin' for
his heart to stabilize.

1475
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:24,919
I don't know who to believe.

1476
01:38:25,048 --> 01:38:27,966
Can I bring you back
something to eat?

1477
01:38:28,093 --> 01:38:30,501
A falafel
or some pizza?

1478
01:38:32,848 --> 01:38:35,386
No, we just ate.

1479
01:38:35,517 --> 01:38:39,301
I keep thinking about
how tough my father was.

1480
01:38:39,438 --> 01:38:42,854
Now I know
he had to be like that...

1481
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:44,857
to make us tough.

1482
01:38:46,528 --> 01:38:48,687
'Cause this city,

1483
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:54,024
it'll kill you
if you aren't strong enough.

1484
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:58,237
No, the city
doesn't discriminate.

1485
01:38:58,373 --> 01:39:01,908
- It gets everybody.
-

1486
01:39:04,546 --> 01:39:07,583
I gotta go.
Another call.

1487
01:39:13,806 --> 01:39:16,842
We're all dying,
Mary Burke.

1488
01:39:44,044 --> 01:39:46,500
Get ready, Frank.

1489
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:49,548
Missed a drug shooting while you were
dicking around in there.

1490
01:39:49,675 --> 01:39:51,548
Gonna be trauma tonight, baby.

1491
01:39:51,677 --> 01:39:53,800
As long as we keep moving.
No standing still.

1492
01:39:53,929 --> 01:39:57,464
} I'm so bored with the U. S. A. 
Well, what can I do }

1493
01:39:57,599 --> 01:40:00,055
Look at your screen!
Give us some blood!

1494
01:40:00,185 --> 01:40:02,225
66-X ray, a man
at the bus terminal...

1495
01:40:02,354 --> 01:40:05,106
shot three years ago
says his arm hurts.

1496
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:30,839
} I'm so bored with the U. S. A. 
Well, what can I do }

1497
01:40:32,593 --> 01:40:35,084
Come on, Tom.
Pick up a job.

1498
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:38,055
You want some bum in the bus terminal?
We'll wait for a real call.

1499
01:40:38,182 --> 01:40:40,221
- Let's get in a fight then.
That's your job.
- Who with?

1500
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:43,969
Just keep driving. Keep moving.
No stopping. We're sharks.
We stop too long, we die.

1501
01:40:46,398 --> 01:40:49,565
Let's break something, Tom. Let's
bust something! Let's bomb something!

1502
01:40:49,693 --> 01:40:52,101
- What do you wanna break?
- I don't know.
Let's break some windows!

1503
01:40:52,237 --> 01:40:54,693
- Why?
- Destruction! Distraction!
I feel the need!

1504
01:40:54,823 --> 01:40:57,824
You need a reason, Frank. You just don't
go around breaking people's windows.

1505
01:40:57,951 --> 01:41:00,952
- That's anarchy.
- What's the reason, Tom?
Give me a reason.

1506
01:41:01,079 --> 01:41:03,950
All right, let me think.
Oh, look at this.

1507
01:41:04,082 --> 01:41:07,333
Classic cabby move.
Hey, swami!

1508
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:10,497
It's called a crosswalk! You're
supposed to stop before it, not on it!

1509
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:14,047
You Senegalian raghead!
Motherfucker!

1510
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:29,185
I know who to work over.

1511
01:41:31,652 --> 01:41:33,775
Him!

1512
01:41:33,904 --> 01:41:37,949
This guy's been terrorizin'
the neighbourhood for weeks,

1513
01:41:38,075 --> 01:41:40,826
ever since he got out of jail,
wreaking general havoc,

1514
01:41:40,953 --> 01:41:42,826
contributing to
the bad name of the place.

1515
01:41:42,955 --> 01:41:47,035
You know, the term "menace to society"
was made up for him!

1516
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:51,493
- He's crazy. He can't help it.
- Oh, yeah?

1517
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:54,335
Well, why don't they
put him away?

1518
01:41:54,466 --> 01:41:56,922
Prisons don't want him.

1519
01:41:57,052 --> 01:42:00,468
I took him to the hospital yesterday.
I gave him a cup of water.

1520
01:42:00,597 --> 01:42:02,756
I was very nice to him.
And here he is again.

1521
01:42:02,891 --> 01:42:05,347
Oh! Look at that!

1522
01:42:05,477 --> 01:42:07,553
Tell me
that's a crazy person.

1523
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:09,976
Huh? Every move
is calculated!

1524
01:42:10,107 --> 01:42:12,942
He knows exactly
what he is doing.

1525
01:42:13,068 --> 01:42:16,152
Frank,
this is the guy.

1526
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:18,949
I've been after him for weeks.
He's quick, though.

1527
01:42:19,074 --> 01:42:21,909
He runs like a rat.
He'd be tough for one person.

1528
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:24,705
- But with the two of us, you know...
- Okay, what do I do?

1529
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:26,739
Okay, I'm gonna
get out here.

1530
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:29,447
If he sees me, he'll run.
He doesn't like me.

1531
01:42:29,585 --> 01:42:32,502
You start talkin' to him
about baseball or something.

1532
01:42:32,629 --> 01:42:35,167
I'll sneak around behind him
and get down,

1533
01:42:35,299 --> 01:42:37,172
and then you push him.

1534
01:42:37,301 --> 01:42:39,792
And when he falls,
we get him.

1535
01:42:39,928 --> 01:42:44,175
- That's ridiculous.
- Believe me, it always works.
The simpler, the better.

1536
01:42:44,308 --> 01:42:47,427
Okay?

1537
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:49,684
Havin'fun now!

1538
01:42:57,488 --> 01:42:59,694
That's a hell of a swing
you got there, Noel.

1539
01:42:59,823 --> 01:43:02,658
- I'm thinking Mattingly in his prime.
- Mattingly ain't shit.

1540
01:43:02,784 --> 01:43:05,406
Me, I swing like Reggie.

1541
01:43:05,537 --> 01:43:07,744
Huh? Mr October,
number three.

1542
01:43:07,873 --> 01:43:09,747
Game six
of the World Series.

1543
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:11,749
All right!

1544
01:43:11,877 --> 01:43:14,664
You hit it.
Come on, take a crack at it.

1545
01:43:14,797 --> 01:43:16,670
It's okay.

1546
01:43:19,092 --> 01:43:21,251
Come on, hit it!

1547
01:43:21,386 --> 01:43:24,304
-
- I better not.

1548
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:26,720
Go ahead.
Give it a go.

1549
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:29,057
Try it.

1550
01:43:29,186 --> 01:43:31,095
Yeah?

1551
01:43:33,649 --> 01:43:36,353
Okay.
What the hell.

1552
01:43:36,485 --> 01:43:40,648
The next year, tiebreaker
for the division in Boston.

1553
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:44,695
The Yanks down two to nothing. 
Bucky Dent steps to the plate.

1554
01:43:44,827 --> 01:43:47,068
- Lucky-Fucky-Bucky, man.
- The pitch: High heater.

1555
01:43:47,204 --> 01:43:50,121
Bucky knows what's comin'.
He steps in.

1556
01:43:50,249 --> 01:43:54,377
Smash! Over the Green Monster!
Yeah!

1557
01:43:54,503 --> 01:43:58,086
Frank!
What the...

1558
01:43:58,215 --> 01:44:01,548
What the hell are you doin'?
Huh?

1559
01:44:01,677 --> 01:44:05,924
Now get down those stairs
and go after him!

1560
01:44:06,056 --> 01:44:08,381
You meet me back here in ten minutes
if you can't find him.

1561
01:44:08,517 --> 01:44:11,222
Call out if you see him!
Remember, he runs like a rat!

1562
01:44:11,353 --> 01:44:15,517
Come on, Frank!
Get with the programme, man!

1563
01:46:05,551 --> 01:46:08,670
Why did you kill me, Frank?

1564
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:14,267
I didn't mean to.

1565
01:46:14,393 --> 01:46:16,682
You should've helped me.

1566
01:46:16,812 --> 01:46:20,726
I tried to help.
I wanted to.

1567
01:46:25,946 --> 01:46:27,820
Rose?

1568
01:46:27,948 --> 01:46:31,364
- Don't you love me?
- Rose.

1569
01:46:34,746 --> 01:46:36,953
Rose?

1570
01:46:46,258 --> 01:46:49,425
To the moon, Alice!
Little motherfucker!

1571
01:46:51,555 --> 01:46:54,888
- Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
- What the fuck?

1572
01:46:55,017 --> 01:46:57,093
- Get the kit!
- Frank!

1573
01:46:57,227 --> 01:46:59,553
You're gonna be all right, Noel.
We're gonna save you. Do it, Tom!

1574
01:46:59,688 --> 01:47:01,930
I'll call for fuckin' backup!
I swear!

1575
01:47:02,065 --> 01:47:06,277
- You'd call for fuckin' backup?
Fuck you!
-

1576
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:11,530
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.

1577
01:47:44,858 --> 01:47:46,602
Let him through!

1578
01:47:50,155 --> 01:47:52,444
Let him through.
Bring him through.

1579
01:47:52,574 --> 01:47:55,065
Who got that funky
motherfucker this time?

1580
01:47:55,202 --> 01:47:57,491
Last show of the night.

1581
01:47:57,621 --> 01:48:00,788
What do you got?
What... Oh, boy.

1582
01:48:00,916 --> 01:48:03,917
- Oh, boy. Nurse Crupp!
Anybody else hurt?
- No.

1583
01:48:04,044 --> 01:48:05,918
Get him over by
the counter over there.

1584
01:48:06,046 --> 01:48:09,000
- All right, we're gonna need
an X ray for a C-spine.
- Got it.

1585
01:48:09,132 --> 01:48:11,670
I'm gonna need
respiratory down here.

1586
01:48:11,802 --> 01:48:14,589
Crazy bastard. 
At least he's intubated.

1587
01:48:14,721 --> 01:48:16,928
- Won't hear him screamin'tonight. 
-  People, hear me out.

1588
01:48:17,057 --> 01:48:21,221
Now, the path to your well-being and
salvation will not be over Griss'body.

1589
01:48:21,353 --> 01:48:24,936
You can forget about that, 
'cause Griss gets off in 47 minutes.

1590
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:27,770
Then he's goin' home to take a bath.
Nice warm bath...

1591
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:29,810
Nurse Crupp, I'm gonna need
another line here.

1592
01:48:29,945 --> 01:48:32,946
Fine. One second. Here you are.

1593
01:48:33,073 --> 01:48:36,193
Notify CAT scan. We're gonna need
a C. T. Right away. Welcome home, buddy.

1594
01:48:36,326 --> 01:48:39,991
Oh, look who we have. You're
gonna have to start paying rent here.

1595
01:48:40,122 --> 01:48:41,996
- Where are you puttin'him?
-  Three.

1596
01:48:42,124 --> 01:48:44,531
Give me some gloves, please. 
Nurse, call CA Tscan.

1597
01:48:44,668 --> 01:48:47,420
- Tell 'em we'll be there
in a couple minutes.
- I got it.

1598
01:49:07,774 --> 01:49:10,312
Is Patrick Burke here?
I brought him in.

1599
01:49:42,851 --> 01:49:47,015
-  Frank?
- Yes?

1600
01:49:47,147 --> 01:49:50,267
Where have you been?

1601
01:49:52,444 --> 01:49:54,318
What is it?

1602
01:49:56,907 --> 01:49:58,781
Let me go.

1603
01:51:40,802 --> 01:51:42,760
Code!

1604
01:51:53,273 --> 01:51:55,562
-  What's this?
- Hejust coded.

1605
01:51:55,692 --> 01:51:57,899
- What a way to begin the day. 
Are we doing C. P. R. ?
- Mm-hmm.

1606
01:51:58,028 --> 01:51:59,985
One mil epi. 
Let me see this.

1607
01:52:00,113 --> 01:52:03,317
- Is this the man who was down
in the E. R. For so long?
- Yes, it is.

1608
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:05,941
Seventeen codes. 
My God.

1609
01:52:06,078 --> 01:52:08,747
- Who's this man?
- He says he's the one
who brought him in.

1610
01:52:08,872 --> 01:52:10,580
The family?

1611
01:52:10,707 --> 01:52:13,543
Seventeen codes.

1612
01:52:13,669 --> 01:52:15,875
Well, they must be prepared.

1613
01:52:16,004 --> 01:52:17,997
You know how they can be.

1614
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:20,041
Yeah, I know.

1615
01:52:26,056 --> 01:52:27,930
Okay, stop C. P. R.

1616
01:52:35,023 --> 01:52:36,897
That's it. 
I'm calling it. 6:02.

1617
01:52:37,025 --> 01:52:40,525
Are you gonna
tell the family?

1618
01:52:50,831 --> 01:52:53,701
Die! Die! Die!

1619
01:52:53,834 --> 01:52:57,452
Son of a bitch!
Die! Die!

1620
01:52:57,588 --> 01:53:00,458
Die! Die!
Die! Die!

1621
01:53:00,591 --> 01:53:03,295
Bastard!

1622
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:14,644
-
-  Who is it?

1623
01:53:14,771 --> 01:53:17,262
- Frank.
- Oh, come on up.

1624
01:53:28,202 --> 01:53:30,075
Hi.

1625
01:53:32,122 --> 01:53:34,245
He's dead, Mary.

1626
01:53:34,374 --> 01:53:36,830
Your father passed.

1627
01:53:39,505 --> 01:53:42,920
They just moved him
to the second floor, to I. C. U.

1628
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:45,292
He coded.

1629
01:53:45,427 --> 01:53:49,211
They shocked him too many times.
I'm sorry.

1630
01:53:56,355 --> 01:53:59,521
I don't know how he held on
as long as he did.

1631
01:54:02,361 --> 01:54:03,985
I'm sorry.

1632
01:54:08,909 --> 01:54:11,614
You have to keep
the body going...

1633
01:54:11,745 --> 01:54:15,529
until the brain and heart
recover enough to go on their own.

1634
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:26,962
Forgive me, Rose.

1635
01:54:30,138 --> 01:54:32,131
It's not your fault.

1636
01:54:32,266 --> 01:54:35,469
No one asked you to suffer.

1637
01:54:35,602 --> 01:54:38,140
That was your idea.

1638
01:54:48,699 --> 01:54:51,154
Noel was almost killed.

1639
01:54:51,285 --> 01:54:53,491
I took care of him.

1640
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,992
He's gonna pull through.

1641
01:55:00,377 --> 01:55:02,334
Would you like to come in?

1642
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:04,751
Yes.
