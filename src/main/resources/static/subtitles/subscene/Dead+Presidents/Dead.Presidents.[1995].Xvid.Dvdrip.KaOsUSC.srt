00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,333
Man, what's takin' you so long?
It's cold as a motherfucker out here.

3
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:10,378
I had to get the last stop.
Quiet, punk.

Man, I thought we was homies, man.

9
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:33,353
Well, why you gotta be
askin' me all that? I mean...

00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,278
I'm just lookin' out for you.

11
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:39,237
All I'm sayin', man, fine as she is,
she should be giving you something.

12
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:42,882
I bet you ain't even
smelled the pussy, eh?

13
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:44,960
You two realize that soon
we're gonna be out of school, right?

14
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,845
- Oh, sure.
- After four long years of that shit, man.

15
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:52,011
I can't fuckin' wait to get out. That's
all I've been thinkin' about, man.

16
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,168
You know? I just be thinkin' about like

17
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:58,491
You know, I can dig some travelling.

18
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,417
Nigger, you sound like
you rich or somethin'.

19
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,659

Oh, bullshit, Skip, man.
Ain't nobody gonna grab me.

23
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:16,829
Jose, a recruiter
can see your dumb ass a mile away.

24
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:20,033
Look at you.
You're a recruiter's dream. You a 1-A.

25
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:22,755
A one-way ticket to motherfuckin'
Vietnam if I ever saw one.

26
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,912
That's why I'm goin' to Hunter College.
You goddam right.

27
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,036
I ain't fightin'
no white man's war. Shit.

28
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,921
Them Vietcongs, chongs, whatever

29
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:33,837
I don't even know
them motherfuckers, man.

30
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:36,437
And I ain't afraid of no war.

31
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,558
Man, what the fuck you been smokin'?

00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:42,246
Look, y'all might think
I'm crazy, but...

33
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:44,164
I just wanna do somethin'
that's different.

34
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:48,044
Yeah, well, gettin' your
fuckin' head blown off is different.

35
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:50,651
Hey, man, turn that shit down!
And slow this motherfucker down!

36
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,977
- Ain't nobody in a hurry to go to school.
- Man, leave that shit up.

37
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:02,341
You know I fucked Monica, right? Her
mama came in, caught us the other day.

38
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,503
Came in, seen my dick,
jumped in the bed too.

39
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:06,544
- Later on, you chump suckers.
- Ah, fuck you.

40
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:08,467

42
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:13,110

Sit your nasty ass down.

00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,076
Oh, hey. How you doin'?

Um, I heard your truck.

46
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:32,280
Seems like you hear my truck

47
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:36,087
Well, uh, morning
is the best time to study, so...

48
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:39,410
You should, uh, try workin'
on your first boyfriend.

49
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:43,284
I'm too busy studyin'
to be worryin' about boys.

50
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,615
Your sister up?

51
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:51,217

00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,628
- Good morning, Anthony.
- Oh, hey.

54
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:07,151

55
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:10,272
- Uh, so you goin' to school today?
- Mmm.

56
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,274
I could lay in bed all mornin'.

57
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:15,112
Oh. See, now...
Now that'd be real nice.

58
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,832
- Don't even think about it.
- Well, look, uh...

59
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:21,201

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,859
Hard shoe.

69
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:53,426

You know, you brought me luck the other

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,712
- See? Now, that's how it goes.

76
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:14,915
- L-I'm gonna use the same number too.

77
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:18,083
What's goin' on?
Hey, what's goin' on?

00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:46,256
Hey there, Peanut! What's goin' on?

00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:57,151
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Kirby's back there in the back, man.

85
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,314
Put that in Brooklyn

86
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,430
- Okay, man.

90
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,001

Oh, yeah.

00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:34,612
- Aw, shit!
- Oh, man, Kirby.

93
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:37,419
Made me miss my shot.

94
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:39,344
You know these motherfuckers down South.

95
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:42,699
I wonder if half the time
they believe what they be sayin'.

96
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,660
What's a nigger gonna do?

97
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:48,549
We got blood in this land
from slaves.

98
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,594
Been to war. Spilt our blood.
Shit, I been to war. I spilt blood.

99
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,673
Ha! That's right.
Tell 'em, Kirby.

100
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:55,869
You over there fightin' in Korea.

101
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:59,397
That's how I got this plastic-ass leg.
Nicky, fix me a drink.

102
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,917
Ko-motherfuckin'- rea.

103
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,806
Damn! Mmm!

104
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,967
Never gonna give you up

105
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,326
That's why I had to leave that
motherfucker, because if I'd have...

106
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,928
If I'd have still been down there,
I'd have killed me a motherfucker.

107
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:19,772
Man, shit ain't gonna change.
What make you think shit gonna change?

108
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:22,332
Nigger, what's your little
narrow ass doin' up in here, man?

109
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,095
Leave that boy alone
and let him shoot.

110
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:31,384
Aw, Kirby, man, you know he too
goddam young to be up in here, man.

111
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,975
He can outshoot you.

112
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,025
Oh, shit.

113
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:38,664
Oh, I know you out
your motherfuckin' mind, man.

114
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,104
Put your money
where your mouth is.

115
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:50,315
I take your money.
Rack 'em, boy.

116
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:56,917

You got my two dollars?

121
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:10,284
Game ain't over yet, man.

122
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,612
Got the eight ball,
corner pocket.

123
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:16,691
Oh, man!

124
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:23,019
Don't run out of here without payin' me
after that boy whup you.

125
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:25,261
Yeah, at least I will
run out of this, motherfucker.

126
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:27,816
People that owe me money don't pay me,
I take care of 'em.

127
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,390
Man, will you get the fuck off
my motherfuckin' table, please?

128
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:41,234
- Baby-baby-baby, baby-baby-baby
- Chicken-haired motherfucker.

129
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:44,312
Ain't no goddam business
bein' here in the first place.

130
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:52,321
Ooh, missed it by that much.

131
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:55,366
- Cleanup time.
- You don't never play with me.

132
00:11:57,489 --> 00:11:59,765
Eight ball, corner pocket.

133
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:07,289
Oh! Yes! Game.

134
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,896
Hey, that's a good game, Cowboy.

135
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:15,058
You're a lucky motherfucker,
you know that?

136
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,937
Aw, I wouldn't say luck,
but, you know.

137
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:22,741
- Just know how to play a little bit.
- Here's the money.

138
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,659
- Give that to Kirby.
- All right.

139
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,547
Uh, wait, wait.
This is two dollars.

140
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:33,954
See, uh, you bet me, so that means,
uh, you owe me some money too.

141
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:38,915
Man, fuck you.

142
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,350
Why you gotta cheat?

143
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:44,316
Man, who the fuck you think
you talkin' to, man?

144
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:46,601
You know what? I'm gonna tell
everybody around here...

145
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:50,199
when it comes to playin' pool,
Cowboy likes to cheat.

146
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:52,524
Nigger, I'll kick

147
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,562
Oh, man.

Get the fuck off of me, man!

155
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:21,951
- Get on out of here!
- You a bad motherfucker!

156
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:24,228

00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:34,681
- You all right, kid?
- Oh, yeah.

158
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:37,191
Just a little cut, you know.
It's all right.

00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:43,205
Yep. You do a real good job

00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,445
Well, you know, I try.

161
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:50,169
But, uh, you better be cool.
Don't let your mom and pop find out.

162
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:52,244
Oh, no way.
I won't do that.

163
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:00,177
It's for you.

164
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:05,703
Oh, man. Whoa!

165
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:08,300
- Hey, thanks, Kirby.
- Ain't nothin' to thank me for.

166
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:12,580
- You earned it.
- Oh. Twenties.

167
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,341
Hey, kid, you wanna take
a little run with me?

168
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:21,874
Yeah, I'll take
a little run with you.

169
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,591
Say, uh, Kirby, where we goin'?

170
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:31,116
Like I told you,
just a little run.

171
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,355
A run. Okay. All right.

172
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,405
- Wanna drive, kid?
- Who, me?

173
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,000
No, not "me. "
You, motherfucker.

174
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:43,924
Well, Kirby,
I don't have my licence yet.

175
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:46,653
Aw, shit. Fuck the dumb shit.
You wanna drive or what?

176
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,204
Yeah. All right, I'll drive.
Yeah.

177
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,656
- Pull over here.
- All right.

178
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:58,053
Come on. Come on.

179
00:14:58,183 --> 00:15:00,777
What you call her, Nellie?
Come on, Nellie.

180
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,303
I call this bitch
whatever I wanna call her.

181
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:18,919
Listen here.
Keep that motor runnin'.

182
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,188
- I'll just be a minute here.
- Yeah, all right.

183
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:49,132
- Stop messin' with my gold! - Wait a
minute! - How many times I gotta tell you?

184
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:57,742
I ain't no motherfuckin'
play toy! I'll kick your ass!

185
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:01,709
- Get the fuck up!
- You get the fuck up off of Spyder!

186
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:04,584
No.

187
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,749
You got more heart than
your punk-ass old man. Come here.

188
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,270
- Oh, man, Kirby!
- Oh, what the...

189
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:14,834
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid son-of-a-bitch!

190
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:17,395
You grabbed the wrong leg,
you stupid cocksucker. Come here!

191
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:20,197
- Get on back in here now, Spyder.
- You asshole!

192
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,674
- I want my motherfuckin' money, hear?
- Easy, Kirby.

193
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,683
- Now! - Easy, man!
- Dumb son-of-a...

194
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:27,085
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid cocksucker.

195
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,442
- I'll fuck you up.
- Get on back down there.

196
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,613
- They gonna call the police.
- I got 15 miles to go now

197
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:38,525
- Come on. Come on!
- And I can hear my baby callin' my name

198
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:41,653
Floor this motherfucker.

199
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,579
Floor it.

200
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:49,694
Now I'll be so glad
to see my baby

201
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:53,299
And hold her in my arms
one more time

202
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,426
Now when I kiss her lips

203
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,545
- I'll turn a backward flip
- You did good, kid.

204
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,869
You're almost as good
a getaway driver as me.

205
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:04,351
Uh, thanks. Say, uh...

206
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:06,792
So you were a getaway driver, huh?

207
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,313
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What? Wh-What's wrong?

208
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:16,794
- I oughta go back there and kill that bastard.
- Why? What happened?

209
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:19,122
Motherfucker made me lose
a whole pack of cigarettes.

210
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:22,482
A pack of cigarettes?
A pack of cigarettes?

211
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,764
I thought maybe you should be
worried about your leg or somethin'.

212
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:29,649
- Oh, that shit's funny to you, huh?
- No, no, it's not funny.

213
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:31,568
I tell you what. The next time
the motherfucker grabs me by...

214
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:34,890
the wrong leg, I'm gonna use it to kick
his ass between his shoulder blades.

215
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,135
- Hey, man, you really did that sucker.
- Yeah, everybody in town...

216
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,455
know I got one leg, and that
motherfucker grab the wrong one.

217
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:44,544
Me and Kirby, baby. Yeah.

218
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:54,261
- This is wonderful news, Edward.
- Thank you.

219
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:58,105
All right, all right.
You see, Anthony?

220
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:01,470
You be thankful you can go to City
College on the financial aid programme.

221
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,394
Yeah, in four years,
you can be just like me.

222
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:10,394
Just like you?

223
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:14,122
You can graduate and maybe even
go to graduate school too.

224
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:18,448
Well, I'll tell y'all one thing.
My mama sure would've been proud.

225
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:21,885
Never would've believed
I got two college graduates.

226
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:27,412
You think about what
you're gonna major in, baby?

227
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,813
The Marine Corps.
Uh, Dad, could you pass the salt?

228
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:34,465
What'd you say?

229
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:40,258
Thanks. I said
the, uh, Marine Corps.

230
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:42,226
- I'm... I'm joinin'.
- Marine Corps?

231
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,100
- Yeah.
- Now that's original.

232
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,070
What you talkin' about, Anthony?

233
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,187
I'm talkin' about
I wanna do somethin' else.

234
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:54,553
I don't wanna go to college.

235
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:57,393
I'm sick of school.

236
00:18:57,521 --> 00:19:02,232
I mean, I don't know why everybody
got this strange look on their face.

237
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:05,681
- It's my life.
- Yeah.

238
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:07,604
It's your life.

239
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:12,044
Looks like to me
you're tryin' to ruin it, baby.

240
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:19,093
You're an idiot.
You know that?

241
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:27,415
Dad, I don't wanna go to college.
I'm just not ready for no college.

242
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:33,539
You always said the marines and fightin'
over in Korea made a man out of you.

243
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:38,668
I figure I be, you know,
livin' my own life.

244
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:43,108
I'll talk to your mama.

245
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:58,682
When your baby and you are tight
and everything is right

246
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,797
- And you is mellow
- Give me that.

247
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,238
There you go.
Now, drink some wine.

248
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,241
You keep everything all right

249
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,011
And you know that
you're the only fellow

250
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,171
Ain't that a groove

251
00:20:14,057 --> 00:20:15,936
Ain't that a groove

252
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,698
Ain't that a groove

253
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:21,700
Told your little ass
you couldn't drink with me.

254
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:24,252
- Ain't that a groove
- Hey, James. Want some of this?

255
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:26,501
- Now, lookee here, fella
- Yeah! Whoo!

256
00:20:26,586 --> 00:20:30,103
Girls like to be in the mood
whenever they think their man is yellow

257
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,224
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Hit me, baby

258
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:38,110
Say, Skeeter, I still can't
believe you graduated, man.

259
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,195
- Man, shut up.
- Glad we out of school, man.

260
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:43,668
I'm sick of these
stupid-ass brothers.

261
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,711
I'm about to get
my pimp thing on started.

262
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:48,276
You know, I got so many ho's now, man,
I gotta get an assistant pimp...

263
00:20:48,404 --> 00:20:51,282
just to keep in track of 'em, you know,
make sure they on the right streets and shit.

264
00:20:51,364 --> 00:20:55,120
Say, Skippy, why... why you always talkin'
about this pimp stuff, man? What's happenin'?

265
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:57,927
'Cause it's real, man. I'm a pimp.
Pimpin' run in my family.

266
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,565
My great-great granddaddy was a slave,
and he was a pimp.

267
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:04,250
He used to have his ho's pick his cotton
in the field. He didn't have to do shit.

268
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,690
You better be careful, man. You're
gonna catch something, Skip. Watch.

269
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:09,697
That's all right, motherfucker. I was
born by the pussy, I'll die by the pussy.

270
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:11,611
Don't worry about
what the fuck I do.

271
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,532
Hey, Skip, do you
believe in superstition?

272
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:16,295
Hell, no.

273
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:20,937
Well, you should, man.
Your stupid ass jinxed me.

274
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:24,584
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- Uncle Sam, man.

275
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:27,664
Dropped a motherfuckin' 1-A on me.

276
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,583
I told you, didn't I?
Didn't I tell you?

277
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:31,983
- Say, when did that happen?
- Last week, Anthony, man.

278
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:34,790
Yeah, right, motherfucker.
Pass the joint.

279
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:39,157
- Anthony, man.
- What?

280
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,552
You know that, um,
that me and Marisol, we tight, man.

281
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:44,760
Yeah, man, y'all are...
Y'all pretty down.

282
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,962
- You would say I love her?
- I don't know.

283
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:48,964
I could say that you love her.

284
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:51,562
- I'm thinkin' about marrying her, man.
- Oh, wait a minute.

285
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,652
- Hey, don't do that shit.
- Hey, man, you might be goin' a little too fast now.

286
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,172
Hey, I love her, man, and did you see
how she looks today at that party, man?

287
00:22:00,297 --> 00:22:03,370
- She looks good enough to marry.
- I'm glad to hear you want me.

288
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,497
What you over here
talkin' about, Anthony?

289
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:11,581
- Why you standin' over here?
- Shut up, Skippy. - Shut up.

290
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:18,105
Anthony, I know you ain't gonna stay over
here talkin' to Skip while my song's playin'.

291
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:20,785
Not if they expect to be
with us tonight.

292
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:24,664
- Look here, Skippy, we gonna have to cut on out, bro.
- Uh, yeah.

293
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,990
- Man, where y'all goin'?
- Uh, we gonna go hang on out.

294
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:29,073
- Look it, have some chicken. - I thought we
was hangin', man. - Have some chicken, man.

295
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:32,395
I told you about them broads,
old punk-ass.

296
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,990
And anyway, Skip,
Brenda lookin' for you.

297
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,596
I don't give a fuck. You tell her I'm
at where I at and I'll be where I be.

298
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:42,805
Motherfuckin' pimp. If I gotta go where
every ho want me to be, I be confused.

299
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:44,966
Motherfucker. Tell her
don't make me hurt my hand again.

300
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:51,605
If you want a do-right all day

301
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:53,531
Woman

302
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:59,859
You gotta be a do-right

303
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,660
All night

304
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,581
Jose, I love you.

305
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:09,459
I love you too, mama.

306
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:12,109
If you give my pussy away
to somebody else...

307
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:14,106
while I'm gone...

308
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,549
I'm gonna come back
and blow that motherfucker up.

309
00:23:18,672 --> 00:23:21,826
I got this itch
I need to be scratched.

310
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:32,035
S- S-S-So... So you're sayin'
that y-your, your mama...

311
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:33,956
is workin' a night shift tonight?

312
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:37,357
Mm-hmm.
And you know what else?

313
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:40,209
You could scratch it
all night long if you want to.

314
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:47,091
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.

315
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,565
You swear Big Bertha
won't get off work early?

316
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:52,656
She's not gonna get off
from work early.

317
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:54,850
- You scared?
- No, I ain't scared. I just don't...

318
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,450
You act like you're scared.
Come on. Shut up.

319
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:00,660
- Where Delilah at?
- She in her room. Come on!

320
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:08,582
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

321
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,589
- Get out.
- Say it loud

322
00:24:10,712 --> 00:24:13,388
- I'm black and I'm proud
- Go to your own room.

323
00:24:13,474 --> 00:24:17,311
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

324
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,801
Once upon a time
I almost lost my mind

325
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,483
I was lonely

326
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:33,485
So lonely

327
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:36,329
Once upon a time

328
00:24:37,772 --> 00:24:40,448
Oh, Juanita.

329
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:42,810
Look, it's okay.

330
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:45,811
It's all right.
It's okay.

331
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,611
- Okay. Okay.
- Let me get your bra.

332
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:50,534
- Okay.
- Let me get it.

333
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:56,696
- Ow. Just unhook it. Just unhook the...
- I can't. I can't.

334
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:59,787
I'll get it.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

335
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:02,020
- Okay. Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

336
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:05,662
Don't peek. Don't look at...
Don't look at me. Okay.

337
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:08,263
Okay. Okay.

338
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:12,154
- Oh!
- What?

339
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:16,513
That's not it.
Up, up, up, up. Higher. Ow.

340
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,077
- That's too high. Wait. Down, down.
- Okay, wait.

341
00:25:19,203 --> 00:25:22,083
- Right there? Okay.
- Yeah.

342
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:25,438
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

343
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:29,484
- It's okay.
- Uh-oh. Wait.

344
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:33,845
Okay. Easy. Ow!

345
00:25:33,974 --> 00:25:35,772
Ah!

346
00:26:01,034 --> 00:26:04,745
Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait.

347
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:08,429
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

348
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,074
- Okay.
- Baby.

349
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,362
You know, Marisol and Jose
goin' down to city hall tomorrow.

350
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:16,920
Oh, yeah? What for?

351
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:18,844
To get married.

352
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:23,249
- Is that right?
- What you think about that?

353
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,450
Nothin', I guess.

354
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:31,927
So I guess you don't want me
to wait for you either.

355
00:26:32,056 --> 00:26:34,857
Look, Juanita,
I didn't say that.

356
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:37,575
So then you're gonna marry me
when you get back?

357
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:42,817
I mean, if you
ain't got somebody else.

358
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:47,381
I don't want nobody else.

359
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:52,505
Juanita, have you
ever thought maybe...

360
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:57,791
maybe I might get hurt out there
and never come back?

361
00:26:57,877 --> 00:27:01,110
You know, I don't want
you waitin' for nothin'.

362
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,952
You're not scared of losing me?

363
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:10,362
I didn't say that either.

364
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:12,284
I'm scared of losing you.

365
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:24,927
So, do you think we could probably
do it one more time before I go?

366
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:26,855
Uh-huh.

367
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,381
Oh, no.

368
00:27:47,514 --> 00:27:49,869
- It's Ma!
- Shh! But it's just 6:30!

369
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:53,546
- She just pulled up.
- Well, go stall her. And close my door!

370
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:55,594
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Oh, man.

371
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,355
I shouldn't have never messed around
with you in the first place.

372
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,438
- Right. - You know Bertha
gonna kill us. - Wait a minute.

373
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:02,476
- Uh-uh. Ain't gonna wait no minute.
Would you move? - Wait a minute!

374
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:06,684
Come on. Let me help you
with them packages.

375
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,566
- Delilah!
- I got it.

376
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,966
Girl, you got my good groceries
all on the ground.

377
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:15,012
Pick those up.

378
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,892
Since I work, the least you girls
could do is keep this place clean.

379
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:31,496
You know I'm gonna
wait for you, Anthony.

380
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,312
Juanita, I gotta go.

381
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:02,246
I gotta go, Juanita.

382
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,201
- Nigger, get out of my yard!
- Fuck you!

383
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,815
Shut up!

384
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:16,929
What's your status? Over.

385
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:30,744
Shit.

386
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:33,630
Head for the rally point!
Get back to the rally point!

387
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:37,747
Get the fuck outta here!

388
00:29:42,236 --> 00:29:44,835
Let's go! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Come on! Come on!

389
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,158
Come on! Move!
Move! Let's go!

390
00:29:48,242 --> 00:29:50,882
Load 'em up! Load 'em up!

391
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:57,001
Oh, fuck!
I'm out of ammo!

392
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,724
- Devaughn! Cover me!
- Stay down!

393
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:03,567
I got him! Hurry up!

394
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:08,609
Don't check out on us, Martin. You're gonna
be all right. You're gonna be all right.

395
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:11,536
- I got him!
- Cover fire!

396
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,054
Goddam it! They got us pinned down!
We'll never make the rally point!

397
00:30:18,104 --> 00:30:20,381
Dugan!

398
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:23,984
You think it's time we get these
fucking dinks off our asses? Huh?

399
00:30:24,108 --> 00:30:25,908
- Relax.
- Fuck you!

400
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,229
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

401
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:32,506
Radio, up!

402
00:30:32,594 --> 00:30:35,111
God don't like dinks.

403
00:30:35,198 --> 00:30:39,239
- How's he doin', Curtis?
- Thanks. Thanks for not leavin' me, man.

404
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,438
- Where the fuck is that radio? Get that radio up here!
- No, no, no, no, no.

405
00:30:42,522 --> 00:30:45,084
Radio comin'! Radio comin'!

406
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:48,405
Get that cover fire, Ferguson.
You wanna die, boy?

407
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,447
Sir, sir! Lieutenant!
Arty freak!

408
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:58,450
Hammerhead, Hammerhead. Recon Cobra.
Emergency fire mission. Over.

409
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:01,686
Hold on, brother. Come on.
Come on, come on.

410
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,770
You gonna make it, dude.
You only got a little longer.

411
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:06,539
- You gonna make it.
- Grid five, seven, one-niner.

412
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,178
- Tell my mama...
- No, no, I don't...

413
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:17,789
Gooks in the bush.
Request firecracker salvo. Will adjust.

414
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,707
How copy? Over.

415
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,664
Roger. Solid copy.
Firecracker shot out.

416
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:25,262
Incoming!

417
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:28,228
Down! Down! Down!

418
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:30,593
Curtis, get down!
Curtis, get down!

419
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:13,264
Out-fucking-standing job.

420
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,429
Saddle up. Let's get to the rally point,
take that whirlybird home.

421
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:20,063
- We got some beer to drink.
- We goin' to the rally point now?

422
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:26,796
The mission's been compromised.
We're goin' to site 37.

423
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,759
It ain't compromised no more.

424
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:32,757
They're dead.
Now this is Sneaky Pete.

425
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:36,201
Reconnaissance.
Some of them dead gooks...

426
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:39,207
they could have important
intelligence papers on their bodies.

427
00:32:42,772 --> 00:32:45,001
All right.

428
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:47,330
- Move 'em out.
- Move out!

429
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:52,935
Hammerhead, Hammerhead.
Cobra on site of your mission now.

430
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:57,537
I count ten... say again, ten...
November-Victor-Alpha-Kilo-India-Alpha.

431
00:32:57,662 --> 00:33:02,057
- How copy? Over.
- I copy, one-zero. Good job.

432
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:04,981
Hammerhead, Cobra. Solid copy.
Good job. Cobra out.

433
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:12,669
Aw, shit, man! What you doin'?
He already dead.

434
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,798
Motherfucker.

435
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:27,954
Looks like we nailed us
an officer.

436
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:34,323
You lucky bastard. You get back to C.P.,
you name your own price, sir.

437
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:38,414
No way, D'Ambrosio.
I'm keepin' this one.

438
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:40,883
Been lookin' for one of these
since Cleon and I got here in '66.

439
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:43,655
Ain't that right, Cleon?

440
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:47,971
I walked right by that guy.

441
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,569
You gotta keep your eyes open.

442
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,621
Oh, man, what the fuck?

443
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:26,125
You hungry or somethin', Cleon?

444
00:34:27,928 --> 00:34:30,491
Just like you, sir.

445
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,332
I'm collectin' me a souvenir.

446
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:40,255
Saddle up. We're movin' out.

447
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:45,775
That's all he's gonna say? You ain't got
nothin' to tell this fuckin' shit, man?

448
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:07,355
- Man, that nigger Cleon crazy.
- Yeah.

449
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,276
- Did you see that shit?
- I saw it.

450
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,359
- Nigger, did you see that shit?
- Yes.

451
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,838
I heard that nigger's supposed
to be a preacher's son and shit.

452
00:35:13,922 --> 00:35:16,724
He cuttin' off motherfucker's
heads for souvenirs and shit.

453
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:19,686
Now, if you hadn't flunked out
of Hunter College, pimp daddy Skippy...

454
00:35:19,808 --> 00:35:21,845
you would've missed all this
good shit down in Vietnam.

455
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:25,890
Kiss my ass, nigger. You the reason
why I'm at this motherfucker anyway.

456
00:35:25,973 --> 00:35:27,805
You didn't tell me 'bout
this recon shit.

457
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:30,125
- That's 'cause you didn't ask me when you were writin' me.
- Nigger, I didn't have to.

458
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:33,010
- Shit, I figured it was better than being a grunt.
- It is.

459
00:35:33,138 --> 00:35:36,132
Ant, motherfucker,
we out in the woods all day.

460
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,492
Them motherfuckin' gooks jumpin' out
like Indians every five minutes.

461
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:41,255
- Man, a nigger ain't made for this shit.
- You thought this was a skate.

462
00:35:41,382 --> 00:35:43,502
Nigger, ain't nothin'
wrong with no skate.

463
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,142
You could just call me
a skatin' motherfucker.

464
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:48,942
I skate my ass right out of here,
they give me a chance to.

465
00:35:50,952 --> 00:35:54,468
- Ain't no shitbirds on my squad.
- Man, what you jivin' about?

466
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:12,082
Hey. Hey.

467
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:15,837
Ant. To the Bronx.

468
00:36:15,969 --> 00:36:17,767
Yeah, uh...

469
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:21,043
to the youngblood
who couldn't be with us today.

470
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:24,009
- Lance Corporal Martin.
- To Lance Corporal Martin.

471
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:35,292
- Yes.
- Yo, Ant, man.

472
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,301
What they be puttin'
in your head out here, man?

473
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:40,662
I mean, you done got into this shit
a little bit too deep, don't you think?

474
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:44,180
You're in recon now, Skip.
You in deep too.

475
00:36:46,192 --> 00:36:48,149
Man, fuck this shit, man.

476
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:50,351
- Oh, come on, man.
- Man, this ain't our war, man.

477
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:53,549
Shit, our black ass should be
back in the Bronx where we belong.

478
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:57,434
Joe-ass got lucky. They sent him
home, gettin' wounded and shit.

479
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,082
Heard he wounded his hand
pretty bad, man.

480
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:03,001
Shit, that's all right, though.
He got out of this shit.

481
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:06,199
I rather be home with a fucked-up hand
up in some pussy than to be out here...

482
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:08,207
healthier than
a motherfucker without it.

483
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:11,248
- Shit.
- Same old Skip. Boy, you ain't changed.

484
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:13,168
That's right.

485
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:16,128
You heard from Juanita?

486
00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:18,292
She used to write me a lot
during my first tour.

487
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:20,566
We got a package for ya!

488
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:25,216
Turns out, man, before I left,
fucked around and got her pregnant.

489
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:28,939
- Man, you bullshittin'.
- No, I ain't.

490
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:32,056
- No shit?
- Dead serious, man. Got a little girl back at home.

491
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:36,266
Oh, man, that's groovy, man. That's
groovy. I can dig it. That's cool.

492
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,221
Hey, dig, man, I know
you got a picture, man.

493
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:41,743
- Let me see her picture. Shit.
- Can't even look at her, man.

494
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:43,865
Man, what the fuck
you mean, bro?

495
00:37:43,953 --> 00:37:46,027
That's your little girl, man.
That's your baby.

496
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:48,511
You know how I survived
26 months in the bush?

497
00:37:48,596 --> 00:37:52,799
Because I don't think about the world,
Skip. That shit don't exist to me.

498
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,039
I don't give a fuck about anything
or anyone in it...

499
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:59,761
because the minute I do, I'm a dead man
out here, and you remember that shit.

500
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:03,278
We'll talk about the world
when we get back.

501
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,764
Yeah, whatever, man.

502
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,928
I'm gonna go get high.

503
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:11,603
I mean real high. And I'm gonna
get my dick sucked too.

504
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:19,779
Big dick. Big.

505
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:22,019
Very, very big.
Can you handle it?

506
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,063
"Hey there, Kirby.
What's happenin' back in the world?

507
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:31,105
If you hadn't heard,
doin' my second tour. "

508
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:35,027
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

509
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:40,746
"We spend most of our time
livin' in the bush.

510
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,237
Kind of numb to
everything out here.

511
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:47,631
Tryin' to keep
my head clear.

512
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,842
Our lieutenant is this crazy
white boy named Dugan from Ohio.

513
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:57,925
He's good at gettin' us
out of crazy situations.

514
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:04,007
We got this one wild-ass
brother out here named Cleon. "

515
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:06,046
Gook fuck.

516
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,575
"His daddy's this big-time preacher, but
you'd never know from his crazy son. "

517
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:14,259
Now you're good.
Now Jesus loves you.

518
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:17,580
"He's from Mount Vernon.
Oh, yeah. You won't believe it...

519
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:20,226
but Skip volunteered
for my unit.

520
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:22,145
I don't think he's
cut out for recon.

521
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:27,503
He's always gettin' high and shit,
tryin' to keep his mind off things.

522
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:31,424
Me, I'm just tryin' to take it one day
at a time and do what's right...

523
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,153
whatever that is.

524
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:37,671
See you when I get
back to the Bronx.

525
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:39,596
Anthony. "

526
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:51,404
That fuckin' shit stinks.

527
00:40:53,335 --> 00:40:57,933
I don't wanna pull rank, Cleon, but if
you don't get rid of that fuckin' head...

528
00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:00,055
I don't hear nobody else
complainin' but you.

529
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,738
Well, maybe you should
listen to your team.

530
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,617
Medical advice, Cleon:
You dump that shit.

531
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:09,660
Hey, Doc, shut the fuck up.
You don't know shit.

532
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:13,264
Fuck you, man. It stinks like
a sack full of assholes.

533
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,144
Ain't a one of us got as much
as a splinter in his finger...

534
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:18,185
since I cut this head off.

535
00:41:18,314 --> 00:41:20,704
This head is our
good-luck charm.

536
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:26,032
Nah, this here's
our good-luck charm.

537
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,198
If you don't mind, Sergeant, I...
My vote is to get rid of it.

538
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:31,843
Man, Cleon, you need to get the fuck on
with that bullshit, man.

539
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:35,561
- That head smell like shit.
- Bottom line, Staff Sergeant.

540
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:40,568
You either get rid of that fuckin' head
A.S.A. fuckin' P., or I'm gonna...

541
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,764
have your ass court-martialed
when we get back to the rear.

542
00:41:44,892 --> 00:41:47,330
We clear?

543
00:41:57,943 --> 00:42:00,743
Cobra, Cobra, Delta six. Over.

544
00:42:00,864 --> 00:42:03,381
Delta six, Delta six, Cobra.
Copy. Over.

545
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:05,544
Cobra, Delta six.
Execute Charlie, Michael...

546
00:42:05,627 --> 00:42:10,581
We're in a world of shit now.
I just buried our luck.

547
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:14,309
Listen up. Change of mission.
A patrol from 25 has found...

548
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:17,753
a shitload of weapons in a vill
about a klik and a half to our whisky.

549
00:42:17,878 --> 00:42:19,677
Platoon commander wants us
to interrogate on the spot.

550
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:22,552
Betancourt, you're the closest one in
the area that speaks that gook shit.

551
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:26,836
So that's where we're headin'.
All right, saddle up. We're movin' out.

552
00:42:26,924 --> 00:42:31,524
- So now where's D'Ambrosio?
- He went to go take a shit.

553
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:34,243
- When?
- When Cleon was diggin' the hole.

554
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,168
- Why the hell didn't you go with him?
- You know how he is.

555
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,410
- He don't like nobody around when he's shittin'.
- Oh, man.

556
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:41,730
Grab his shit.
Let's find him.

557
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:52,019
Aww.

558
00:42:52,142 --> 00:42:54,898
Fuck! Doc.

559
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:57,939
- 360!
- D'Ambrosio, what'd they do?

560
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:01,948
You'll be all right.
Doc's gonna take care of you, okay?

561
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:11,627
This morphine is all
I can do for him right now.

562
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,874
Here, Doc. You can use mine
if that's not enough.

563
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:22,918
Are you crazy? Another one of those
would kill him right now.

564
00:43:33,254 --> 00:43:35,688
What the fuck
you got there, Curtis?

565
00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:39,563
Somethin' about
"Black men, go home.

566
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,574
This isn't your war. "

567
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,934
You get rid of that cocksucking
commie bullshit right now.

568
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:51,421
- Yeah. Right.
- Hey, Curtis.

569
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,302
- Apply some pressure here.
- We gotta hump this man back to the rally point.

570
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,227
Oh, shit.

571
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:00,991
Save me, Curtis.

572
00:44:01,113 --> 00:44:03,107
Look, Adam, you don't
worry 'bout nothin'.

573
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:05,307
We're a team,
okay, brother?

574
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:08,196
- We gonna take care of you.
- Please.

575
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:11,239
Yeah. It's not much longer.
We're almost there.

576
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:14,281
Kill me.

577
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:18,364
Kill me!

578
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:22,360
I would do it
for you.

579
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:24,687
I would do it
for you, Curtis.

580
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:27,128
Buttermilk 17.
Cobra, over.

581
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:31,808
Cobra, Cobra. Buttermilk 17. Inbound
your buzz. Contact on your visual.

582
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:33,735
- Shh.
- Buttermilk 17. Cobra.

583
00:44:33,857 --> 00:44:35,976
Hey, you gonna be all right.

584
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,299
The medevac will be here
in a minute.

585
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:41,461
Do it.

586
00:44:45,388 --> 00:44:47,185
You think
I don't mean it?

587
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:52,189
I can't go home like this.

588
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:55,425
- Hey, what's he saying?
- He's delirious, man.

589
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:03,436
- Please.
- Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk.

590
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,232
- Hooking direct to your 12. Stand by.
- Cobra standing by. Over.

591
00:45:51,155 --> 00:45:53,876
Shh-shh-shh.

592
00:45:57,759 --> 00:46:01,313
Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk 17.
Roger your visual. Pop smoke. Over.

593
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:03,673
Buttermilk 17, Cobra.
Smoke. Over.

594
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:06,878
Pop the smoke.
Get that man ready for medevac!

595
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:21,089
- When'd he go?
- A few minutes ago.

596
00:46:22,538 --> 00:46:25,499
It's better to check out
than go home all fucked up.

597
00:46:27,862 --> 00:46:29,661
No shit.

598
00:47:29,669 --> 00:47:32,344
Oh, shit!
Get down!

599
00:47:33,513 --> 00:47:36,073
Fuckin' assholes!

600
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:39,266
- Stay down! Stay down!
- I'm gonna get these motherfuckers!

601
00:47:39,396 --> 00:47:42,628
Return fire! Fire!

602
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,355
Get these motherfuckers!

603
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:51,558
- Skip! Return some fire!
- Shoot them motherfuckers!

604
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:56,044
Mission aborted! We get the fuck
out of Dodge, back to the rally point!

605
00:47:56,128 --> 00:47:59,248
Ferguson! Get some
fuckin' rounds goin'!

606
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,605
Skip! Cover me!

607
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:05,885
- Dugan!
- Dugan, wait!

608
00:48:07,737 --> 00:48:11,573
Dugan!
Dugan!

609
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:24,869
Skip! Skip!
Snap out of that shit. Go!

610
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:28,468
- Fuck this, man. Let's bug out, Cleon!
- Cobra, move the fuck out!

611
00:48:28,591 --> 00:48:30,662
- Get up! Come on!
- Move it! Move it!

612
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:33,105
Move! Get up!
Get up! Come on!

613
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:45,121
- What are you doin'?
- What is this, man?

614
00:48:45,243 --> 00:48:48,239
- Slow down, man.
- Fuckin' grunts!

615
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,287
- Say, get a special shot for Skip. My man's
goin' home today. - Count of three: 1-2-3.

616
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:53,684
All right. Good.
Now come on, now. Skip, come on, now.

617
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:56,082
Let's see a dap, man.

618
00:49:02,498 --> 00:49:05,615
- All right!
- Get one like this. Get one like this.

619
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:07,653
Come on, now.
Everybody, come on. Get closer.

620
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:10,091
- Ah, man!
- This is Cobra, baby.

621
00:49:10,223 --> 00:49:14,662
- Recon Cobra!
- It's Cobra. Hey, hey!

622
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,941
Team Cobra, ready?

623
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,119
Come on

624
00:49:40,085 --> 00:49:43,078
Come along, come on
and get up and get down too

625
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,808
- Get down, get up
- Say, h-h-hold on a sec.

626
00:49:48,892 --> 00:49:52,730
- Keep the metre running.
- Get down, get up and move your feet

627
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:56,612
Come on and rise, rise, rise
Shake your get-up

628
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:58,967
Straighten up there, marine!

629
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:04,257
He a friend of yours?

630
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:06,694
Friend of yours and
I'll give a discount, marine.

631
00:50:06,826 --> 00:50:09,181
No, man.

632
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,304
Oh, shit.

633
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:16,701
Man, look who's back
in the motherfuckin' world.

634
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:20,070
Dig this motherfucker

635
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:22,916
Look at you, man. That's a mackin'
outfit if I've ever seen one.

636
00:50:22,998 --> 00:50:26,469
- Look, with all the stripes and shit. What, you a captain now?
- No, man.

637
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,396
Look, man, you wear that motherfucker for about
a month, this nigger get all the pussy, man.

638
00:50:30,484 --> 00:50:33,521
Check this motherfucker out, man.

639
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:37,117
Well, look, man... Yeah,
you go get me some squares, man.

640
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:40,725
I gotta take care of a couple things,
baby. I'll get back with you. All right?

641
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:43,241
You stay up now, all right?

642
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:47,605
What's happening, blood?

643
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:49,532
Hey, man, I'm back.

644
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:54,931
My nigger!

645
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:59,422
Come on and get down

646
00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:01,582
Hey, Luther!

647
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:03,425
Tell your sister I'm gonna
be over there later on.

648
00:51:03,508 --> 00:51:05,784
Hey, fuck you!

649
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:11,187
Man, the neighbourhood is changin'.

650
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:14,513
Aw, it's still a good place.
White people movin' out, though.

651
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:19,231
Oh, dig. I saw Juanita
the other day, man.

652
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:22,197
Man, she finer than a motherfucker.

653
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,996
Is that right?

654
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:28,316
You need to go check her out, man.
Go see your little daughter.

655
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:31,086
Remember them big-ass ears
you had when you was young?

656
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:34,129
She got 'em, just like you.
That's how I know it was yours.

657
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:38,570
So, what's up with Joe, man?
Is he, uh... Is he workin' or what?

658
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:42,405
Aw, post office, you know.
Three-quarter gig, part-time.

659
00:51:42,535 --> 00:51:45,256
He gotta do what he gotta do.
He got mouths to feed, you know.

660
00:51:45,376 --> 00:51:47,690
What about you, man?
How you doin'?

661
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,573
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

662
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:52,137
I'm cool, baby. I'm Skippy, baby.
I'm still pimpin'.

663
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:57,382
Need any money
or anything, you know?

664
00:51:57,467 --> 00:51:59,936
Man, I got over like a fat rat
when I got out, man.

665
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:03,467
Dig, I got my school money comin'
from the government once a month.

666
00:52:03,592 --> 00:52:06,106
I got my veteran's cheque
comin' once a month.

667
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:10,627
I got my fifty percent medical cheque
comin' to me for the rest of my life.

668
00:52:10,717 --> 00:52:14,028
I ain't gotta do a goddam thing else
but go to the mailbox, you dig?

669
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:16,722
Hey, man, how the hell you pull
a fifty percent medical?

670
00:52:16,802 --> 00:52:18,759
Nigger, you ain't disabled.

671
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:20,682
Man, some shit got
into me over there, man.

672
00:52:21,924 --> 00:52:23,803
What?

673
00:52:23,886 --> 00:52:27,198
All I know is my blood cells
are all fucked up.

674
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:29,799
Some nights I wake up
in cold sweats and shit.

675
00:52:31,212 --> 00:52:33,522
Don't look at me like that, man.
It ain't the heroin.

676
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:37,007
The heroin ain't never did nothin' to me.
A lot of vets comin' down with this shit.

677
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:40,096
- And they don't know what it is?
- Square biz.

678
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,975
Damn. Look, man, you wanna
come on in the crib or somethin', man?

679
00:52:47,065 --> 00:52:49,341
Nah, man. I'm cool, baby.
Hey, I'm gonna split.

680
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:52,186
But you here, baby. You home.
We got plenty of time to do our thing.

681
00:52:52,307 --> 00:52:54,026
You know what I'm sayin'?

682
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,663
- Brother.
- Brother. Go see your mama.

683
00:53:00,793 --> 00:53:03,515
- Right on. I'm gonna check her out.
- With her fine ass.

684
00:53:03,596 --> 00:53:05,588
You know, I been takin' care
of your mama while you been gone.

685
00:53:05,676 --> 00:53:07,510
Boy, I'll kick your head in.
Don't talk like that.

686
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:22,041
Mmm.

687
00:53:32,578 --> 00:53:34,375
You all right?

688
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:37,180
Yeah.

689
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,024
Well, can't you look me in my eyes?
I ain't seen you in four years.

690
00:53:51,951 --> 00:53:53,864
Well, what'd you do over there?
What was it like?

691
00:53:53,994 --> 00:53:58,354
Look, uh, I'd rather not
talk about that right now.

692
00:53:58,475 --> 00:54:00,356
Well, Anthony, you gonna have
to tell us something.

693
00:54:00,476 --> 00:54:04,189
Now, you know a lot of them boys went over there
and got hooked on them drugs and stuff. You know.

694
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,998
Look, I was in a special unit
out there...

695
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,475
and bad habits could've cost us
our lives.

696
00:54:10,606 --> 00:54:12,484
Well, that's what I'm talkin' about,
them bad habits, honey.

697
00:54:12,566 --> 00:54:16,722
Now, if you picked up some of them things,
there's a lot of places you can go and get help.

698
00:54:16,851 --> 00:54:19,206
No bad habits, Ma.

699
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:21,761
'Cept a little killin'.

700
00:54:21,854 --> 00:54:23,651
For my country, of course.

701
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:27,289
Hey. Let me give you some more
of these collards.

702
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:29,009
- Yeah.
- Baby, this sure is good.

703
00:54:45,472 --> 00:54:49,104
Oh, shit. Look who back.
Look at this motherfuckin' man.

704
00:54:49,195 --> 00:54:51,948
- Hey, what's happenin', youngblood?
- What's goin' on, cool breeze?

705
00:54:52,075 --> 00:54:55,832
- Long time, no see.
- All right now, Pops. What's happenin'?

706
00:54:55,918 --> 00:55:00,154
Hey there. What's goin' on, blood?
Ain't seen you in a long time, man.

707
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:02,519
- Boy just got back. -
Hey, blood. - All right.

708
00:55:02,643 --> 00:55:06,037
- Cheers. My man. Drink!
- All right. How you feel? All right.

709
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:10,764
Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey, I got next game.

710
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,319
- You know that's my table.
- You call that a break?

711
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:16,612
- I got the thing made
- Hold up there, now. It's my shot.

712
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:20,046
Say, chump.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

713
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:25,174
- Ha-ha!
- My man, Joe! What's happenin'?

714
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,538
- Oh, look at you!
- How you doin', man?

715
00:55:28,622 --> 00:55:31,299
- Good, man. What's goin' on, man?
- Jesus Christ, man.

716
00:55:31,426 --> 00:55:33,496
- I can't believe it's you! You cool, man!
- What's goin' on, man?

717
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:36,388
Say, man,
I heard you got wounded out there.

718
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:40,742
Yeah, man. I was in demolitions
and my fuckin' hand gets blown off, man.

719
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:44,753
- Oh, man. Shit.
- Yeah, man. But hey...

720
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,951

is to know about explosives, man!

721
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:51,435
- That right?
- Check you out, Pappy. You got all those kids now.

722
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:54,480
Man, hey. You gotta check out Kirby,
man. He's over in the back room.

723
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:56,599
Yeah. Let's go on back.
He's still back here, huh?

724
00:55:56,725 --> 00:55:59,239
- All right. Dig it.
- Hey. Abre la puerta! Hey! Hey!

725
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:01,636
Doin' all right. You know, Kirby just

726
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:03,765
- Who the fuck is it?
- It's me.

727
00:56:03,848 --> 00:56:05,967
Blood! What's up, blood?

728
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:07,690
- Hey, Nicky. What's happenin', man?
- Skin!

729
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,531
Kirby back there, man.

730
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:11,292
That boy looked at me,
he say, "Kirby...

731
00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:15,126
when she pulled off them drawers,
I thought I'd never stop seein' ass!"

732
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,820
- What's happenin', Captain?
- Who the fuck is that?

733
00:56:24,503 --> 00:56:26,257
- Youngblood?
- Yeah, it's me!

734
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:28,186
Youngblood! Come on, boy!

735
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:34,143
- How you doin'? Come on in the back here, boy. Come on.
- Oh, boy. All right.

736
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:43,316
Man, I been everywhere
lookin' for a gig.

737
00:56:43,439 --> 00:56:46,716
Aw, motherfuckers forget about you
gettin' your ass almost blown off...

738
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:48,276
or whatever the fuck.

739
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:51,999
Yeah. Look, uh, Kirby, uh...

740
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:55,324
I was thinkin', man.
Maybe, uh, come back and work for you.

741
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:58,168
What? Work for me?

742
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:02,040
Yeah. You know. Runnin' numbers.
Like we used to do.

743
00:57:02,132 --> 00:57:06,208
Shh. Fuckin' pigs run me
out of business.

744
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:10,456
How... How the pigs run you outta
business, man? You had 'em on the payroll.

745
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:12,491
Pigs are greedy.

746
00:57:12,621 --> 00:57:14,691
And you gotta remember I'm dealing
with the NYPD...

747
00:57:14,782 --> 00:57:17,297
greediest, most corrupt pigs
on the face of the earth.

748
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:20,500
So I got the fuck out.

749
00:57:20,626 --> 00:57:23,622
I told that motherfucker I'd rather
eat cat shit with a knittin' needle.

750
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:27,386
I wasn't gonna bust my ass sendin'
some cop kids to college. Shit.

751
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:31,189
I dig it.

752
00:57:31,275 --> 00:57:33,665
This place ain't never
made much money.

753
00:57:33,796 --> 00:57:37,268
So I'm just hustlin' here and there.

754
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:39,589
Tryin' to get over,
just like everybody else.

755
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:45,801
It's gonna be all right, kid.

756
00:57:46,765 --> 00:57:49,440
Here's to gettin' over.

757
00:57:49,527 --> 00:57:52,919
I hope, man. Hope. Shit.

758
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:59,771
- You afraid of blood?
- Uh, that's all I been around for the past three years.

759
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:04,808
Anthony Curtis.

760
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:08,051
You related to Tony?
The actor?

761
00:58:08,181 --> 00:58:12,338
N- No. Not...
Oh! The act... No, no, no.

762
00:58:12,464 --> 00:58:15,300
- Different colour, right?
- Yeah! He's a white cat. Yeah.

763
00:58:15,427 --> 00:58:18,898
And his name was Schwartz.
Schwartz, not Curtis.

764
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:21,743
- Okay.
- Know anything about butchering?

765
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,552
Uh, I'm a fast learner.

766
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,465
Here, put that on.

767
00:58:26,876 --> 00:58:28,914
- Here. Take this.
- Need some help, man!

768
00:58:29,037 --> 00:58:30,948
All right.

769
00:58:52,773 --> 00:58:54,732
Hey, uh, is Juanita in?

770
00:58:54,816 --> 00:58:57,093
No, she's not,
but she'll be back in a...

771
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:01,012
in a while.

772
00:59:03,182 --> 00:59:06,257
So you gonna stand out there,
or you comin' in?

773
00:59:06,345 --> 00:59:08,177
I'm gonna come on in.

774
00:59:10,707 --> 00:59:12,859
Girl, check you out.

775
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:19,390
I thought you were goin' over
to the communists.

776
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:22,866
Ah. Nah. Not me.

777
00:59:22,997 --> 00:59:25,387
Now, dig, if you were smart,
that's what you would've done.

778
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:27,476
What?

779
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:30,196
Man, you don't know what the hell
you talkin' about, girl.

780
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,238
No, it's cool. I mean it's not your
fault you been brainwashed by America.

781
00:59:36,767 --> 00:59:39,488
I mean, at least you made it back
alive, right?

782
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:42,843
You know, "Hello, how you doin'?"
That would've been real nice...

783
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,045
before you got off
onto all this political shit.

784
00:59:47,974 --> 00:59:50,855
Welcome home.

785
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:53,288
And welcome to the revolution.

786
00:59:57,462 --> 01:00:00,376
- So, this is Sarah's?
- Mm-hmm.

787
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,097
Oh, wow.

788
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:10,784
- So, is she a smart baby?
- Ahh.

789
01:00:10,872 --> 01:00:13,023
Why don't you find out for yourself?

790
01:00:15,714 --> 01:00:21,078
Hey, y'all. Sorry I'm late.
Traffic on the Cross Bronx was a mess.

791
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,513
Oh. All righty.

792
01:00:27,644 --> 01:00:29,715
There we go.

793
01:00:29,846 --> 01:00:31,566
There you go.

794
01:00:31,686 --> 01:00:34,078
Go play with your blocks.
Go play with your blocks.

795
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:45,408
Hey.

796
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:59,219
Oh, no. Look, Juanita.
I'm in one piece.

797
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:06,268
Hey, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

798
01:01:06,393 --> 01:01:09,989
Come here, Sarah.
Come to Mommy.

799
01:01:10,117 --> 01:01:14,112
Good girl. Come here.
Look at that.

800
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,708
- That's Daddy. Say hi.
- Hi.

801
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,073
This is Sarah Marie Curtis.

802
01:01:19,201 --> 01:01:21,195
- Hi.
- Hello.

803
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:23,965
Hold her, silly. She's yours.

804
01:01:24,045 --> 01:01:25,843
Oh.

805
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:28,277
Hey. Mmm.

806
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:33,321
Hey, um...

807
01:01:33,454 --> 01:01:36,732
Oh, yeah. Be advised.
What's goin' on, my brothers?

808
01:01:40,219 --> 01:01:43,053
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah. This is home.

809
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:45,570
Dig it. Dig it.

810
01:01:45,662 --> 01:01:47,416
Check out Sleepin' Beauty
back there.

811
01:01:49,745 --> 01:01:52,705
Boy, I still can't get over
how gorgeous she is.

812
01:01:52,827 --> 01:01:54,659
Oh, she got that from her mama.

813
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,667
Oh. Okay.

814
01:01:59,993 --> 01:02:02,463
You know, Juanita...

815
01:02:02,595 --> 01:02:07,275
I wanna let you know I...
I did miss you. A lot.

816
01:02:07,398 --> 01:02:09,755
Don't you think I know that, Anthony?

817
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,551
It's not important anyway. The important
thing is that you're here now.

818
01:02:13,683 --> 01:02:15,959
Shh. Come here.

819
01:02:17,245 --> 01:02:18,919
Oh.

820
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:37,212
Hey, baby girl.

821
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,572
Hey, Cutty.

822
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,214
Came by to see you a little earlier,
but you weren't home.

823
01:02:46,987 --> 01:02:48,626
Oh, you know I had class tonight
after work...

824
01:02:48,748 --> 01:02:50,787
and then I stopped over by my mother's.

825
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:55,942
- Oh, yeah. I forgot. It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

826
01:02:57,035 --> 01:02:59,427
I see my little girl's sleepin'
back there, huh?

827
01:02:59,516 --> 01:03:02,316
Yeah. She's all played out.

828
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:08,833
- Cutty, I wanted you to meet, um...
- Look here.

829
01:03:08,924 --> 01:03:11,315
- Got a little somethin' for Sarah.
- Smiling faces

830
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:16,079
- Buy her something real nice.
- Smiling faces sometimes

831
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,810
Hey, Cutty, I told you
to stop spoilin' her like this.

832
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:21,163
Smiling faces

833
01:03:21,251 --> 01:03:24,692
Smiling faces tell lies

834
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:28,088
- Somebody's gotta do it.
- And I got proof

835
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:32,135
- Beware
- Cutty, I want you to meet Anthony.

836
01:03:37,185 --> 01:03:39,860
Okay. All right.

837
01:03:39,986 --> 01:03:42,866
Let me just put her to bed. You come on
in and make yourself at home.

838
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:44,787
Come on in.

839
01:04:08,126 --> 01:04:10,802
Okay. Can I get you something
to drink, or...

840
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,363
Look, Juanita.
Uh, I think I better go.

841
01:04:14,493 --> 01:04:16,564
But you just got here.

842
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:20,253
Who knows, you could be
expectin' company or something.

843
01:04:20,337 --> 01:04:22,569
Nobody's comin' here, Anthony.

844
01:04:22,698 --> 01:04:24,497
I think I still should go.

845
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:31,614
Anthony.

846
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:34,061
I used to see Cutty.
Is that what you wanna hear?

847
01:04:34,146 --> 01:04:36,822
Oh. Blood made that very clear to me.

848
01:04:36,949 --> 01:04:38,940
So then, what's the problem?

849
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,267
Problem?

850
01:04:41,353 --> 01:04:45,107
Why, man throwed two yards on your car.

851
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:48,235
You askin' me what's the problem?
Shit. Obviously nothin'.

852
01:04:48,356 --> 01:04:50,235
Don't come up in here judgin' me.

853
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:52,921
What the fuck, man?
You got a pimp around my daughter?

854
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:54,719
Oh, he is not a pimp.

855
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:56,959
And besides, if you cared anything
about havin' a daughter...

856
01:04:57,084 --> 01:04:59,554
you'd have wrote me back
after I sent you our picture.

857
01:04:59,685 --> 01:05:01,643
But don't jump on me
for havin' a life.

858
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,964
You didn't want one with me.

859
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:08,889
So now what?

860
01:05:09,012 --> 01:05:11,848
Are you gonna leave?

861
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,774
Some bullshit.

862
01:05:21,062 --> 01:05:23,020
Come here.

863
01:05:23,103 --> 01:05:25,665
Come on. Come here.

864
01:05:37,995 --> 01:05:39,825
Ooh, hey

865
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,879
Ya gotta, gotta payback
Payback

866
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:46,116
- Damn!
- Revenge

867
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:54,200
A man
The big payback

868
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:56,204
Got to get back

869
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,445
Cleanup time, Cowboy.

870
01:05:58,569 --> 01:06:01,880
See, man, why the fuck
you always gotta talk some shit?

871
01:06:02,011 --> 01:06:05,406
Payback
Right there

872
01:06:05,536 --> 01:06:08,529
- See, that's why I kicked his fuckin' ass when he was a little kid, man.
- Payback

873
01:06:08,617 --> 01:06:12,294
- Always gettin' smart and shit.
- A man

874
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:14,810
Get down with my girlfriend

875
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:18,737
That ain't right

876
01:06:18,863 --> 01:06:21,379
Now you gonna play this marine
war hero.

877
01:06:21,506 --> 01:06:23,577
Out of touch

878
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:25,706
You know what I think?

879
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:28,424
- I think y'all was some goddam fools goin' over there...
- Gonna fight

880
01:06:28,552 --> 01:06:31,022
fightin' that white man's war.

881
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:34,032
- That's right.
- Payback everything you got to see

882
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:37,192
- What you got when you get back here, huh?
- Yeah

883
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:39,667
- Never do any damn thing
- Not a goddam thing.

884
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:45,042
Course, you do got
that fine-ass Juanita.

885
01:06:45,124 --> 01:06:48,276
- Throw me out
- Now, what the fuck you lookin' at me like that for, man?

886
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:49,887
I'm just complimentin' you
on your taste.

887
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:54,366
Throw me away
You had all the rage

888
01:06:54,451 --> 01:06:57,445
- You had me down
- Course you know...

889
01:06:57,573 --> 01:06:59,567
- That's the facts
- Baddest motherfucker this side of Nicky Barnes...

890
01:06:59,694 --> 01:07:01,925
- Now, you punk
- My boss man Cutty...

891
01:07:02,056 --> 01:07:04,492
Gettin' ready for the big payback

892
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:06,371
I thought that might ring a bell.

893
01:07:06,499 --> 01:07:08,652
The big payback
That's where I learned

894
01:07:08,782 --> 01:07:12,095
He used to tap that ass
while you was over in Nam.

895
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:14,016
- The big payback
- Motherfucker!

896
01:07:14,106 --> 01:07:18,260
- Goddam!
- You do some fuckin' talkin', don't you, goddam it!

897
01:07:18,388 --> 01:07:20,108
Try this on, motherfucker.

898
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,706
- No, no, no. He needs his ass whipped.
- What you mean "no"?

899
01:07:24,393 --> 01:07:27,627
Get the fuck outta here!
Talk shit now, huh, motherfucker?

900
01:07:27,717 --> 01:07:30,708
- Shut the fuck up. Come on. Come on. Motherfucker. Now what?
- I'm ready to be respected

901
01:07:30,837 --> 01:07:33,195
You wanna fuck with me or what?
I'm gonna fuckin' kill your ass!

902
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:35,835
- Say somethin' now, motherfucker.
- That's enough, youngblood.

903
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:40,041
- Pull out your goddam knife!
- No! That's enough. Come on!

904
01:07:40,164 --> 01:07:41,917
- I gonna kill this motherfucker!
- That's enough!

905
01:07:42,006 --> 01:07:43,805
That mother! I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker!

906
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:46,357
- Let me go, Kirby! Let me go!
- No. He's already beat up. Come on now.

907
01:07:46,449 --> 01:07:51,049
- Oh, shit.
- Come on. Let's go get some air.

908
01:07:51,173 --> 01:07:53,450
Don't need no fuckin' air!
Let me go!

909
01:07:53,534 --> 01:07:55,730
- Let me hit him, hit him, hit him
- That's game.

910
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,224
Shit.

911
01:08:19,313 --> 01:08:21,749
Gonna have the aeroplane corn bread.

912
01:08:21,836 --> 01:08:24,192
Here we go.
Ooh!

913
01:08:24,277 --> 01:08:26,746
- You gonna spoil that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

914
01:08:26,879 --> 01:08:29,519
Gonna spoil that one in your belly too.

915
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:32,442
I don't need no spoiled kids.

916
01:08:32,523 --> 01:08:34,435
Hey, why not?

917
01:08:34,565 --> 01:08:36,284
Not enough black babies are spoiled.

918
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:38,723
Ain't that right, Sarah, hmm?

919
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:40,600
You got a point there.

920
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:43,687
Come on. Sit on down.

921
01:08:45,774 --> 01:08:48,607
Big girl. Come here.

922
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:52,095
Come here.

923
01:08:53,459 --> 01:08:56,021
Look at you.

924
01:08:56,102 --> 01:08:58,219
Fat girl.

925
01:08:58,303 --> 01:09:00,772
See what we got ourselves here.

926
01:09:00,864 --> 01:09:03,825
Oh, you know what? I think we're gonna
have ourselves a little boy.

927
01:09:05,829 --> 01:09:08,343
Yeah, come on, man.
You got to be a boy.

928
01:09:08,469 --> 01:09:11,225
Boy, boy, boy. Mm.

929
01:09:11,352 --> 01:09:15,793
Ant Junior.
See, it's the power of the mind.

930
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:18,306
We will ourselves a little boy.

931
01:09:20,196 --> 01:09:22,429
Then can you will yourself
a better job?

932
01:09:25,922 --> 01:09:28,392
Can you will yourself to stop
drinkin' so much?

933
01:09:28,525 --> 01:09:31,280
Come on, honey.
Don't even start that shit, all right?

934
01:09:31,406 --> 01:09:34,481
I thought we supposed to be havin'
a nice time here.

935
01:09:40,535 --> 01:09:42,252
Look, Juanita.

936
01:09:43,335 --> 01:09:46,296
I- I'm gonna get myself
a... a good job.

937
01:09:46,378 --> 01:09:50,134
You know how long you been singin'
that same old song now, Anthony?

938
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:52,861
I mean, in case you haven't noticed,
this here's the real world.

939
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:55,259
Ain't no free meals here
like in the marines.

940
01:09:58,026 --> 01:10:01,499
Say, let me tell you somethin'.
Wasn't nothin' free in the marines.

941
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:04,310
I earned every meal
and every fuckin' dollar, all right?

942
01:10:08,794 --> 01:10:10,627
Look, everything's gonna be cool.

943
01:10:13,998 --> 01:10:16,434
You know I'll be
five months next week.

944
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,679
You're five months pregnant,
you can't be no nurse's aide.

945
01:10:19,801 --> 01:10:21,600
I said we'll be all right.

946
01:11:01,314 --> 01:11:05,310
Hey, um... Anybody want some speed?

947
01:11:05,437 --> 01:11:08,033
Get the fuck outta here
with that shit.

948
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,434
Say, why don't you
cut the bullshit, Joe?

949
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,361
Can't you clear your mind
for one sec, man?

950
01:11:13,444 --> 01:11:15,514
Now, you sure that they
pick up cash money?

951
01:11:15,644 --> 01:11:17,476
Hey, cash money, bro.

952
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,916
Like clockwork, once a month.
Then they stop by the post office...

953
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:23,160
before they make their final run
to Washington, man.

954
01:11:23,249 --> 01:11:26,084
All the way to Washington, D.C.,
where they burn the money.

955
01:11:26,211 --> 01:11:28,282
Can you believe that shit?

956
01:11:28,373 --> 01:11:30,843
Old bills, man.
Sometimes a couple million.

957
01:11:30,936 --> 01:11:33,896
- How many guards?
- Four.

958
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:36,493
Two in the front
and one in the back carry revolvers.

959
01:11:36,619 --> 01:11:41,094
The other one, 12-gauge shotgun, man.

960
01:11:41,183 --> 01:11:42,903
You think we can take 'em?

961
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:48,580
I can't say, man.
I mean...

962
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:51,664
four guards, and all of 'em
packin'?

963
01:11:51,752 --> 01:11:55,463
I put up the guns. I get the money
together to get the plans goin'.

964
01:11:55,594 --> 01:11:57,472
But you got to be the master planner.

965
01:11:57,556 --> 01:12:00,025
You got medals for blowin'
motherfuckers up out there.

966
01:12:00,157 --> 01:12:04,234
- Man, I heard you were like John Wayne.
- Well, then that's the deal.

967
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,432
Yeah, all that money.

968
01:12:06,561 --> 01:12:08,361
Ah, man.

969
01:12:10,482 --> 01:12:13,285
Anthony. You down?

970
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:18,167
- Ahh.
- The look

971
01:12:19,492 --> 01:12:22,290
- Of love
- Let's drink on it anyway.

972
01:12:22,373 --> 01:12:26,688
- Is in your eyes
- Mmm.

973
01:12:28,257 --> 01:12:30,172
- Ahh.
- A look

974
01:12:30,299 --> 01:12:32,211
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Your heart

975
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:36,303
- Say, man. Shhh. -
Can't disguise - Hmm?

976
01:12:36,424 --> 01:12:39,976
Put the goddam thing away.
Get your little pyromaniac ass...

977
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:42,743
- You gonna be walkin' in a minute.
- Aw, cool out, Kirby, man.

978
01:12:42,868 --> 01:12:45,465
I'm not gonna burn your car.
Not yet, at least.

979
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:56,356
Don't go

980
01:12:56,478 --> 01:12:58,755
Forget it, Juanita.

981
01:12:58,839 --> 01:13:00,672
Come on. Watch out there.

982
01:13:04,324 --> 01:13:06,443
The look of love

983
01:13:09,368 --> 01:13:11,803
What's the problem, Anthony?

984
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,482
What is it? I mean,
is it because I'm pregnant?

985
01:13:15,613 --> 01:13:17,286
Shh. Come on.
Now, don't be silly.

986
01:13:17,374 --> 01:13:19,207
So, then what's the problem?

987
01:13:23,257 --> 01:13:25,058
Come on. Talk to me.
What is it?

988
01:13:30,024 --> 01:13:32,665
I told you. You need to
leave that alcohol alone.

989
01:13:56,564 --> 01:13:59,239
- No! No!
- Anthony! Anthony, baby!

990
01:13:59,324 --> 01:14:01,362
It's me.
It's me. It's all right.

991
01:14:01,447 --> 01:14:03,279
It's all right.
Come here.

992
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:07,844
Shh. Shh. Shh.
It's just another dream.

993
01:14:07,971 --> 01:14:09,771
It's just another dream.

994
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,370
This is my best cut,
Mrs Stein. Enjoy.

995
01:14:19,502 --> 01:14:21,935
Thank you very much, Saul.

996
01:14:22,062 --> 01:14:25,614
- He's such a nice man.
- What did he give you?

997
01:14:25,744 --> 01:14:27,702
- We need to talk.
- Oh.

998
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:34,469
- So what's happenin'?
- You're a good man.

999
01:14:34,551 --> 01:14:38,262
Aw, come on, Saul. I ain't got time to kibitz
with ya. I got a whole lot of meat to cut.

1000
01:14:40,397 --> 01:14:42,228
I'm closing down the shop.

1001
01:14:44,278 --> 01:14:46,839
Should've told you sooner,
but I thought maybe...

1002
01:14:46,919 --> 01:14:49,392
business, you know,
pick up a little.

1003
01:14:51,044 --> 01:14:52,637
Sorry.

1004
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:57,605
- Here.
- Oh, no, look, Saul... No. I can't.

1005
01:14:57,729 --> 01:15:00,565
What am I gonna do with it?
I have to get rid of it.

1006
01:15:00,651 --> 01:15:02,290
Come on.

1007
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:11,610
Now I know

1008
01:15:11,698 --> 01:15:15,330
We have great respect

1009
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:18,218
For the sister and mother

1010
01:15:18,344 --> 01:15:20,143
It's even better yet

1011
01:15:22,507 --> 01:15:24,977
But there's the joker in the street

1012
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:28,946
Here you go, brother.
Don't let the bullshit get to you.

1013
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,865
I'm tryin', man. I'm tryin'.

1014
01:15:30,955 --> 01:15:33,070
You wanna get the man's foot
off your neck?

1015
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,910
Come check us out.

1016
01:15:36,038 --> 01:15:38,757
Take care of yourself, brother.
Live righteous.

1017
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,155
Here you go, brother.
Here you go.

1018
01:15:41,282 --> 01:15:44,194
Take care of yourself, brother.
Come see us now.

1019
01:15:44,323 --> 01:15:46,394
Don't let us hang around this town

1020
01:15:46,485 --> 01:15:50,606
- Here you go, sister.
- And let what others say come true

1021
01:15:50,728 --> 01:15:52,242
Brothers and sisters, here you go.

1022
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,604
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Hey, youngblood.

1023
01:16:12,934 --> 01:16:14,652
Bringin' in the groceries, huh?

1024
01:16:16,135 --> 01:16:18,524
Lord, have mercy.

1025
01:16:18,656 --> 01:16:21,219
Man, I remember
when I was married.

1026
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:24,379
I used to love
to bring home the groceries.

1027
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:26,853
Made me feel real good.

1028
01:16:26,984 --> 01:16:30,866
Like a man. Know what I mean?

1029
01:16:32,147 --> 01:16:33,867
Hey, listen, youngblood. Uh...

1030
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,867
I just dropped by
to see Juanita and Sarah.

1031
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,871
- You know, lay a little somethin' on 'em.
- Stopped by to see my baby?

1032
01:16:38,992 --> 01:16:40,585
Is that right?

1033
01:16:40,714 --> 01:16:42,512
You know, youngblood...

1034
01:16:42,635 --> 01:16:45,515
I took care of your woman and your baby
when you were in the war.

1035
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:48,909
Now, a man oughta get a little respect
for somethin' like that.

1036
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,673
Now, I ain't gonna lie to you.

1037
01:16:50,762 --> 01:16:54,041
I care about Juanita.
I care about her a whole lot.

1038
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:58,006
But you back now, and I'm gone.

1039
01:16:58,088 --> 01:17:01,604
So from this point on, you should
consider me like a friend of the family.

1040
01:17:01,729 --> 01:17:03,801
Find yourself in a jam and shit,
need a little cash...

1041
01:17:03,932 --> 01:17:06,653
you come see me,
I'll front you.

1042
01:17:06,732 --> 01:17:09,089
- Keep your shit.
- Listen, brother.

1043
01:17:09,175 --> 01:17:11,327
I know about pride.

1044
01:17:11,457 --> 01:17:13,413
But you got mouths to feed.

1045
01:17:13,537 --> 01:17:15,370
Now, I laid a little cash
on Juanita.

1046
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,220
Say, man, stay the fuck
away from my family.

1047
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,861
What did you say?

1048
01:17:19,983 --> 01:17:22,339
You heard me, goddam it.

1049
01:17:22,425 --> 01:17:24,383
I said, "Stay the fuck away
from my family. "

1050
01:17:26,507 --> 01:17:28,181
See, I ain't the enemy, youngblood.

1051
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,949
I don't want no trouble.

1052
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:41,750
Shit.

1053
01:17:47,082 --> 01:17:50,441
See, I tried to be a friend,
motherfucker.

1054
01:17:57,812 --> 01:17:59,644
Surprise, nigger.

1055
01:18:02,014 --> 01:18:04,813
Big bad marines.

1056
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:06,726
Look at you now.

1057
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:10,294
Does she suck you?

1058
01:18:10,421 --> 01:18:11,901
Fuck you?

1059
01:18:12,982 --> 01:18:15,544
Make you feel like a man?

1060
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,456
Make you feel real good?

1061
01:18:19,387 --> 01:18:22,107
Huh, boy?

1062
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,984
Now, she wasn't doin' it like that
before you went to the war, now was she?

1063
01:18:29,514 --> 01:18:31,632
Now you gettin'
all that good lovin'...

1064
01:18:33,038 --> 01:18:35,598
and you can't even put food
on your fuckin' table.

1065
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,793
Come on, Santa Claus.
Open your mouth and suck this.

1066
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:43,399
Come on. I got a present for you.
Suck it!

1067
01:18:43,525 --> 01:18:46,917
- Suck it, nigger!
- Kill me, motherfucker.

1068
01:18:47,005 --> 01:18:48,886
Shoot me right now.

1069
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:50,762
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1070
01:18:57,134 --> 01:18:59,936
You lucky this is personal, nigger.

1071
01:19:00,058 --> 01:19:02,129
I ain't gonna kill you
over no woman.

1072
01:19:03,299 --> 01:19:05,213
Don't you ever...

1073
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,253
in your fuckin' life...

1074
01:19:08,382 --> 01:19:10,854
bite the hand
that feeds you, nigger.

1075
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,866
See ya, Santa Claus.

1076
01:19:26,037 --> 01:19:28,314
- Hold still now.
- I'm all right.

1077
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:30,714
- Hold still.
- No, I'm all right. Damn!

1078
01:19:46,851 --> 01:19:49,685
You givin' him that money back.

1079
01:19:49,773 --> 01:19:52,131
He won't take it back.

1080
01:19:52,257 --> 01:19:56,251
What the fuck you talkin'...
You better get his shit back to him!

1081
01:19:56,379 --> 01:20:00,214
Even if I wanted to give it back to him,
Anthony, he wouldn't take it back.

1082
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:04,139
W- W-W-Wait. What the fuck you talkin'
about, "if you wanted to give it back"?

1083
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:06,939
No, no, no, no.
Fuck that shit.

1084
01:20:07,027 --> 01:20:10,466
Have you forgotten you just lost your
damn job? We need that fuckin' money.

1085
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:13,189
- We don't need his money.
- Yeah, well, Anthony, I'll tell you what.

1086
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:17,506
You start bringin' some real money in here, like a real
man, and then I'll think about givin' it back to him.

1087
01:20:17,594 --> 01:20:20,987
Until then, I don't wanna hear shit.

1088
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:25,717
You need to get your tight ass together, that's what you
need to do, and stop feelin' sorry for your damn self.

1089
01:20:25,841 --> 01:20:29,552
Sometimes it's like you ain't even
the same man I knew before the war.

1090
01:20:29,683 --> 01:20:32,597
That's who I was in love with. That's who
I thought showed the fuck back up here.

1091
01:20:32,725 --> 01:20:35,482
I don't know who the fuck you are.

1092
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:38,289
So, what? You just, uh,
suck his dick so good...

1093
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:41,369
he just start
throwin' money at you, right?

1094
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:43,046
What is with you?

1095
01:20:43,173 --> 01:20:46,087
Why you so damn paranoid?
I ain't fuckin' him.

1096
01:20:46,215 --> 01:20:48,173
Not at this moment, you ain't. No.

1097
01:20:48,298 --> 01:20:49,936
But the motherfucker
ain't sniffin' around here...

1098
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:52,734
tossin' money in your
motherfuckin' face for nothin'!

1099
01:20:52,821 --> 01:20:55,816
Yeah, well, I sleep with you
every night, don't I?

1100
01:20:55,943 --> 01:20:59,142
You know, Juanita,
that's a damn good question.

1101
01:21:00,787 --> 01:21:03,585
Come on. Go ahead.

1102
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:06,304
Admit this shit, man. Be honest.
You fuckin' him, right?

1103
01:21:06,431 --> 01:21:08,821
- Is that what you wanna hear, Anthony? That's
what you wanna hear? - Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.

1104
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:11,548
Fine. I'm fuckin' him.

1105
01:21:14,956 --> 01:21:17,713
So, uh, whose baby is that?

1106
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:22,991
D- Don't even answer that shit.

1107
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:25,119
No, you right. I ain't gonna answer it.
I mean, shit. You Anthony.

1108
01:21:25,204 --> 01:21:28,518
You the big marine man with no damn job.
You know every fuckin' thing.

1109
01:21:28,647 --> 01:21:34,408
Answer this for me: If you think I'm jivin' you
so much, Anthony, why the hell you with me? Huh?

1110
01:21:34,492 --> 01:21:38,283
Why the fuck you with me? What, you think
I need you? Do you think I need this shit?

1111
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:40,691
Fuck. You can't get a decent job,
you won't fuck me.

1112
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:43,492
The only time I get to hold you is when you're
havin' one of them silly-ass nightmares...

1113
01:21:43,578 --> 01:21:45,456
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1114
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,974
You don't know, girl.
You really don't know.

1115
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:53,539
- Don't you fuckin' walk away from...
- You better get the fuck off of me!

1116
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:56,465
- Don't walk away from me, Anthony.
- Let me go.

1117
01:21:56,547 --> 01:21:58,780
- Don't you... What about Sarah?
- I'll fuckin' kill you, girl!

1118
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:02,268
Don't you ever run up on me! Ever!
Ever run up on me again!

1119
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:05,944
I'll fuckin' kill you, Juanita!
Get the fuck off me!

1120
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:07,866
Bunch of shit!

1121
01:22:25,849 --> 01:22:28,239
- Yeah!
- That's right. You can't trust them!

1122
01:22:31,774 --> 01:22:35,486
- Now, they send our men off to Vietnam...
- That's what they do.

1123
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,895
to fight for this
so-called democracy.

1124
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:41,337
- That's right. Preach, sister.
- Yeah! Yeah!

1125
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,374
But when they get back down
to the South Bronx...

1126
01:22:43,461 --> 01:22:46,502
and to Bed-Stuy and Harlem
and Watts, etc., etc...

1127
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:49,220
shit is worse than ever.

1128
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,301
- There is something very sick about that.
- He's a devil.

1129
01:22:56,432 --> 01:22:58,185
That's right,
he's the devil.

1130
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,347
That's right!

1131
01:23:04,838 --> 01:23:08,151
Go, sister! Go on!

1132
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,796
- Power to the people!
- Power to the people!

1133
01:23:12,765 --> 01:23:15,839
- In 'n' out.
- Never, never gonna give you up

1134
01:23:15,966 --> 01:23:18,483
I'm never, ever gonna stop

1135
01:23:18,569 --> 01:23:20,877
Not the way
I feel about you

1136
01:23:21,008 --> 01:23:24,006
- Girl, I just can't live without you
- There you go.

1137
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:26,363
- I'm never, ever gonna quit
- What can I get you, baby?

1138
01:23:26,494 --> 01:23:28,770
Anyway, so like I was sayin',
I ran into this brother...

1139
01:23:28,897 --> 01:23:30,774
and he, uh, gave me
this flyer.

1140
01:23:30,858 --> 01:23:33,010
So I figured I'd go over
and check it out.

1141
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:38,096
And there you were, up there
talkin' that ol' righteous shit.

1142
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:42,217
I'm just a college student tryin' to do
her part to rally the people together.

1143
01:23:42,344 --> 01:23:46,502
But, dig, we need more
than talk. It's... It's time to do.

1144
01:23:46,589 --> 01:23:49,059
- Do what?
- Revolution.

1145
01:23:49,152 --> 01:23:52,111
Oh, wait a minute. See.
Y'all a little outta my league now.

1146
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:54,266
Is that what you're gonna say
when the revolution comes?

1147
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:57,230
W- When it's time
to pick up a gun?

1148
01:23:57,317 --> 01:23:59,148
What you know
about weapons?

1149
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:03,030
I'm qualified
to handle a. 45...

1150
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,202
an M-16 rifle,
a. 38-calibre pistol...

1151
01:24:06,323 --> 01:24:08,282
and a Russian AK-47.

1152
01:24:08,365 --> 01:24:11,485
An AK-47?

1153
01:24:15,411 --> 01:24:17,323
Why don't you join us?

1154
01:24:17,453 --> 01:24:20,127
A lot of brothers
from the war have.

1155
01:24:20,254 --> 01:24:23,215
Baby, I got enough
heavy shit to deal with.

1156
01:24:30,582 --> 01:24:32,575
- I got you, brother.
- Relax.

1157
01:24:35,345 --> 01:24:37,576
You're so uptight.

1158
01:24:37,707 --> 01:24:40,702
Damn, I got to make
some fuckin' bread.

1159
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:43,629
I'm through
with your sister, but...

1160
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,185
I still got to take care
of my baby girl, Sarah.

1161
01:24:47,314 --> 01:24:50,149
Shit, and the one
that's on the way.

1162
01:24:50,277 --> 01:24:52,668
Damn!

1163
01:24:52,798 --> 01:24:56,954
Look, anyway, uh, I got
this plan to make some money.

1164
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:59,517
I want you to keep
this shit to yourself.

1165
01:25:01,726 --> 01:25:04,718
At 6:15 a. m., the truck
pulls outta the post office...

1166
01:25:04,846 --> 01:25:07,966
at 149th and Grand Concourse.

1167
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:11,169
Now, it makes one stop
before it goes to D. C...

1168
01:25:11,252 --> 01:25:15,247
which is a mail drop-off
at First Federal Loan and Savings...

1169
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:18,212
which is on Noble Street
and West.

1170
01:25:18,297 --> 01:25:20,130
Now, Kirby...

1171
01:25:20,218 --> 01:25:22,131
you're gonna position yourself
in a getaway car...

1172
01:25:22,259 --> 01:25:25,460
at the end of the corner,
where you can see everything.

1173
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:29,619
Jose. Me and you gonna
position ourselves behind the bank...

1174
01:25:29,706 --> 01:25:34,179
underneath the left
and the right side of the loadin' dock.

1175
01:25:34,309 --> 01:25:38,305
Delilah, you're gonna position
yourself inside the Dumpster...

1176
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:41,391
which is located directly across
from the loadin' dock.

1177
01:25:44,277 --> 01:25:46,792
Now, Skippy, I want you
to position yourself...

1178
01:25:46,918 --> 01:25:49,993
approximately ten feet
from the alleyway.

1179
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,432
There, you post
a lookout.

1180
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,355
We all know what to do
at the point of attack...

1181
01:25:55,443 --> 01:25:58,200
because we've gone
over that shit enough.

1182
01:25:58,326 --> 01:26:02,801
If anybody gets caught, you shut
the fuck up, and we'll keep your money.

1183
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:05,366
Shh! Fuck that shit, man.

1184
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,848
I'm telling you right now,
if I get caught...

1185
01:26:09,935 --> 01:26:12,451
- I'm shooting my fuckin' way out.
- Nigger, put that shit down.

1186
01:26:12,576 --> 01:26:15,298
I think we need another man
on the street with Skip.

1187
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,172
Someone to cover
the other side.

1188
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:20,097
- I agree.
- Oh, man! Hell, no!

1189
01:26:20,224 --> 01:26:22,136
We don't need no 'nother man.
Shit, I can see.

1190
01:26:22,225 --> 01:26:25,504
- Besides, we got too many motherfuckers anyway.
- Fuck that shit, Kirby, man.

1191
01:26:25,587 --> 01:26:28,547
Everybody trusts
everybody here, right?

1192
01:26:31,832 --> 01:26:33,870
I can get somebody
from our organization.

1193
01:26:33,993 --> 01:26:37,955
Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't want none
of them revolutionary niggers involved.

1194
01:26:38,037 --> 01:26:40,392
You can cut your eye at me
all you want to.

1195
01:26:40,517 --> 01:26:42,637
I ain't too keen on havin'
that broad up in here neither.

1196
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:46,072
Well, you the one talkin' about we need
another man. Make up your goddam mind.

1197
01:26:46,203 --> 01:26:48,922
You have somebody in mind,
Anthony?

1198
01:26:49,044 --> 01:26:52,563
We might as well put a motherfuckin' ad
in the paper. Then we gonna get everybody.

1199
01:26:52,686 --> 01:26:55,362
Shit, ain't gonna be
no money left for a nigger.

1200
01:26:59,092 --> 01:27:02,883
Oh, yes! Y'all didn't know
your reverend was a gamblin' man?

1201
01:27:03,016 --> 01:27:06,977
A sinnin' man?

1202
01:27:07,058 --> 01:27:09,777
I was a man who maimed!

1203
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,620
I was a man who killed!

1204
01:27:15,744 --> 01:27:20,060
We all know it was done
in the name of the wicked one.

1205
01:27:20,147 --> 01:27:23,938
The one that was
cast down from heaven.

1206
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:27,382
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

1207
01:27:27,512 --> 01:27:31,793
I said y'all know
who I'm talkin' about!

1208
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:34,478
Can I get a "hallelujah"
in this house of God?

1209
01:27:34,558 --> 01:27:36,630
Hallelujah!

1210
01:27:36,761 --> 01:27:38,275
Hallelujah!

1211
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,714
Well, look here, man.
Skip is in. Period. All right?

1212
01:27:41,805 --> 01:27:45,401
I stand a lot to lose
if this thing blows up in my face.

1213
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:48,441
The last time I saw him, he was
shooting poison in his veins.

1214
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:51,442
Yeah, I know. Well, you know,
he's tryin' to shake that shit, man.

1215
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:55,287
- He's still on drugs.
- And I still trust him with my life, Cleon.

1216
01:27:56,976 --> 01:28:00,332
Remember that last battle?

1217
01:28:00,456 --> 01:28:02,289
He froze up.

1218
01:28:02,419 --> 01:28:05,856
For a minute.
Then h-he broke out of it.

1219
01:28:05,941 --> 01:28:10,382
And when he "broke out of it,"
Dugan was dead.

1220
01:28:10,464 --> 01:28:12,616
Come on, Cleon. You know that
could've happened to any of us.

1221
01:28:12,706 --> 01:28:16,306
Now either you in
or you out. Which one?

1222
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:18,866
How much money did you say
was in that truck?

1223
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,850
We still got
about 15 minutes.

1224
01:30:37,934 --> 01:30:40,242
I tell ya, I could've
used another cup of coffee.

1225
01:30:40,374 --> 01:30:42,175
Let's make this quick.

1226
01:30:49,102 --> 01:30:50,899
Bank security.

1227
01:30:56,669 --> 01:30:58,500
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

1228
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,423
- Mornin'.
- Good mornin'.

1229
01:31:35,096 --> 01:31:37,214
Oh, f...

1230
01:31:50,909 --> 01:31:53,581
You waitin' on
the number 11 bus?

1231
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:55,542
Yes.

1232
01:31:55,671 --> 01:31:58,552
I don't think
she runs this early.

1233
01:31:58,674 --> 01:32:03,034
I caught it the other morning,
uh, at this same time.

1234
01:32:03,156 --> 01:32:04,477
You sure about that?

1235
01:32:05,799 --> 01:32:07,631
Uh-huh.

1236
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:10,873
- Let me check for you.
- No need to go to any trouble, Officer.

1237
01:32:11,003 --> 01:32:12,802
No, no, no.
No trouble at all, brother.

1238
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:18,195
I see by that patch
on your jacket you were in recon.

1239
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:22,270
I was a 5th marine. Always willin'
to help out a fellow leatherneck.

1240
01:32:27,436 --> 01:32:29,269
Brown on patrol.
Brown on patrol.

1241
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:32,670
Requesting off-hour route check
on number 11.

1242
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,230
Dispatch to Brown.
Hold for schedule.

1243
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,154
That's a copy.

1244
01:32:37,242 --> 01:32:39,361
Do somethin', Cleon.

1245
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:16,551
- Ambush! Ambush!
- Drop it, motherfucker!

1246
01:33:50,616 --> 01:33:53,088
What the hell?

1247
01:33:55,341 --> 01:33:57,061
Shit!

1248
01:34:28,525 --> 01:34:31,485
Joe! Come on. Let's move.

1249
01:34:41,294 --> 01:34:43,892
Oh, goddam it!

1250
01:35:23,006 --> 01:35:25,727
Fuck! Shit!

1251
01:35:31,931 --> 01:35:34,449
Oh, shit!

1252
01:35:35,895 --> 01:35:37,933
Anthony!

1253
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,355
- Did you see that shit, man?
- Hey, what the fuck wrong with you?

1254
01:36:13,483 --> 01:36:15,759
- See the way the fuckin' doors blew off, man?
- No, motherfucker!

1255
01:36:15,844 --> 01:36:18,121
Motherfuckin' Joe, you blew the whole
motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

1256
01:36:18,207 --> 01:36:20,644
- It blew up like that, man!
- That's how you fucked your hand up last time!

1257
01:36:20,768 --> 01:36:23,159
You... And the money... You fucked up.
I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass!

1258
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:25,682
Grab what you can, motherfucker,
before the whole thing burns!

1259
01:36:25,773 --> 01:36:27,764
Hey, Anthony and Delilah
gotta see this shit, man.

1260
01:36:27,894 --> 01:36:30,012
I'm gonna go get 'em!
Hey, Anthony!

1261
01:36:31,817 --> 01:36:35,369
You gotta see the shit I did, man.
I blew that shit up, man!

1262
01:36:35,499 --> 01:36:38,813
You gotta see it, man!
You gotta see the shit I did!

1263
01:36:40,984 --> 01:36:43,453
Let's get outta here.
Put the gun down. Put the gun down.

1264
01:36:43,585 --> 01:36:45,418
Come on, Delilah.
Let's get up. Up. Let's go.

1265
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:50,229
Come on, bro.

1266
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:53,151
We gotta go, man.

1267
01:36:53,272 --> 01:36:56,267
I can't...
I can't leave her.

1268
01:36:56,354 --> 01:36:59,156
You ain't gotta
leave her, bro...

1269
01:36:59,237 --> 01:37:01,627
'cause she's already gone.

1270
01:37:05,681 --> 01:37:07,161
Get up here!
Go on!

1271
01:38:04,206 --> 01:38:07,005
Unit 1004, do you copy?

1272
01:38:07,088 --> 01:38:09,205
Please respond.

1273
01:38:09,329 --> 01:38:13,119
Do you require assistance?
Do you copy?

1274
01:38:13,212 --> 01:38:15,446
Any available units
in the vicinity of Noble Street.

1275
01:38:15,575 --> 01:38:17,806
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three. Repeat.

1276
01:38:17,935 --> 01:38:19,893
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three.

1277
01:38:47,998 --> 01:38:50,752
God's not gonna
forgive me for this one.

1278
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,874
I'll tell you what, Reverend. With this kind
of money, you can buy your way into heaven.

1279
01:38:56,565 --> 01:38:59,205
That's where you're wrong, brother.

1280
01:38:59,286 --> 01:39:03,725
We done bought our way into hell.

1281
01:39:03,809 --> 01:39:07,725
The plain fact is that I promised
the Lord I would never sin like this.

1282
01:39:10,294 --> 01:39:13,529
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure
I even want any of this dirty money.

1283
01:39:14,977 --> 01:39:17,448
Well, I'll tell you what,
Reverend.

1284
01:39:17,539 --> 01:39:19,373
We'll find somethin'
to do with your share.

1285
01:39:19,463 --> 01:39:23,173
- Amen to that shit.
- No. No, no, no, no.

1286
01:39:23,304 --> 01:39:25,866
- I'll take the money.
- You lyin' sack o' shit.

1287
01:39:27,947 --> 01:39:30,987
I'm sure the Lord will find
another way for me to do my penance.

1288
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:34,982
Just tell me
one thing, Cleon.

1289
01:39:35,112 --> 01:39:37,344
Why the fuck
you didn't grab the cop?

1290
01:39:37,434 --> 01:39:40,590
You killed him.
A young brother.

1291
01:39:40,717 --> 01:39:43,916
If you wouldn't have froze up like a bitch, maybe
I wouldn't have had to do that shit, now wouldn't I?

1292
01:39:43,999 --> 01:39:46,069
Would y'all
shut the fuck up?

1293
01:39:47,522 --> 01:39:50,675
Man, Delilah. Shit.

1294
01:39:50,804 --> 01:39:53,843
Man, radio said they got
Joe's stupid ass.

1295
01:39:53,967 --> 01:39:57,518
Fucked it up.
The whole plan was fucked up.

1296
01:40:00,212 --> 01:40:03,124
We ain't do shit right
out there, man. Shit.

1297
01:40:05,897 --> 01:40:09,813
Y'all make sure that Jose's share
goes to Marisol and his kids.

1298
01:40:09,899 --> 01:40:11,855
- Walk on by
- Done.

1299
01:40:17,944 --> 01:40:20,939
Your junkie ass really
messed up out there.

1300
01:40:21,068 --> 01:40:22,659
Don't blame me
for your fuck-ups.

1301
01:40:22,749 --> 01:40:27,985
I told Anthony I didn't want nothin' to
do with a crazy, devil-filled junkie!

1302
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:30,753
- What?
- You listenin' to me? Look at him.

1303
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:34,955
- Oh, shit!
- Now say some more shit!

1304
01:40:35,037 --> 01:40:36,869
I'll knock your ass
right back down.

1305
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:39,598
Fake-ass wanna-be preacher,
no-members-havin' motherfucker!

1306
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:43,518
Why don't y'all stop actin'
like some fuckin' clowns?

1307
01:40:43,644 --> 01:40:46,479
You know, you niggers
sure is silly.

1308
01:40:46,567 --> 01:40:50,084
Now, you're standin' here fightin',
and we got over $300,000...

1309
01:40:50,207 --> 01:40:53,362
of cold, hard, unmarked U.S. cash
to split up five ways.

1310
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:56,763
Let me tell ya somethin'. You make me lose
count again, I'm gonna shoot me a motherfucker...

1311
01:40:56,893 --> 01:40:58,851
and then we gonna be splittin'
this thing up four ways, hear?

1312
01:41:02,017 --> 01:41:05,979
Man, I can't believe this.
They was gonna burn all this shit.

1313
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,935
All this shit, and a nigger
can't even find a job.

1314
01:41:10,462 --> 01:41:14,255
Well, that's Uncle Sam
for you, baby.

1315
01:41:14,385 --> 01:41:16,185
Money to burn.

1316
01:41:18,709 --> 01:41:21,589
Police have issued an all-points
bulletin for the remaining...

1317
01:41:21,672 --> 01:41:23,504
...Reserve Bank
on Noble Street.

1318
01:41:23,592 --> 01:41:25,028
Faces painted skeleton white.

1319
01:41:25,154 --> 01:41:27,795
Cobra, request your status.
Over.

1320
01:41:27,876 --> 01:41:29,675
- Five federal security guards...
- Anthony!

1321
01:41:29,797 --> 01:41:32,439
- She's already gone.
- Do it. Kill me.

1322
01:41:32,521 --> 01:41:34,112
The bloody shootout erupted...
an armoured truck... explosives...

1323
01:41:34,242 --> 01:41:37,792
No, motherfuckin' Joe. You blew the whole
motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

1324
01:41:37,924 --> 01:41:39,198
...the deaths of nine people.

1325
01:41:39,285 --> 01:41:42,722
The heroin ain't never
did nothin' to me.

1326
01:41:42,808 --> 01:41:45,085
...just moments away from the scene
of the crime... Robbery turned bloody...

1327
01:41:45,168 --> 01:41:48,528
- Had some shit got into me over there, man.
- Crushed to death by...

1328
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:51,612
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

1329
01:41:51,734 --> 01:41:54,728
Had a very shiny nose

1330
01:41:54,857 --> 01:41:56,734
- And if you ever saw it
- What you slowin' down for?

1331
01:41:56,857 --> 01:41:58,007
- Be cool. Be cool.
- What you doin'?

1332
01:41:58,138 --> 01:42:01,532
- Come on. Come on.
- What the fuck, man? Aw, shit!

1333
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:05,213
- All of the other reindeer
- What the fuck we doin' over here?

1334
01:42:05,344 --> 01:42:07,813
- Say, man, check out all these kids.
- Man!

1335
01:42:07,906 --> 01:42:09,705
Hey, let's go to the liquor store
and go to the club.

1336
01:42:09,826 --> 01:42:12,468
Look, man, I'm gonna take care of you.
We're gonna go down to the club.

1337
01:42:12,549 --> 01:42:14,542
- We don't know them motherfuckers!
- That's the whole point, baby.

1338
01:42:14,631 --> 01:42:16,910
Come on. Get in the spirit.
Hey, y'all come on over here!

1339
01:42:17,033 --> 01:42:20,027
- Nigger, we gonna get robbed.
- Hey, be cool, nigger. Y'all come on over here.

1340
01:42:20,115 --> 01:42:24,796
- Be cool, man. Damn.
- Rudolph, with your nose so bright

1341
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,916
All of y'all gonna get some.
All right. All right.

1342
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,834
- Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
- What, motherfu...

1343
01:42:28,922 --> 01:42:30,992
Yeah, man. Merry Christmas,
motherfucker. Go on. Leave me alone.

1344
01:42:31,123 --> 01:42:34,754
Say, say, Skippy. Hey, man, why don't you
bring your ass over here and quit that jivin'.

1345
01:42:34,884 --> 01:42:37,721
Come on. Yeah, yeah. Y'all take
all the toys. All right. Get one.

1346
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:40,317
- See what I'm sayin'? I ain't kiddin'. We givin' it away.
- All right. All right. Yeah.

1347
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:43,245
That's why Santa Claus don't wanna come 'round here
'cause he's scared he's gonna get shot or robbed.

1348
01:42:43,372 --> 01:42:48,131
All right. Just one. Hey, hey, hey. Give
me this, man. Get a... Get a... Get a toy.

1349
01:42:48,255 --> 01:42:50,213
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Why you stealin'? You ain't gotta steal.

1350
01:42:50,339 --> 01:42:52,534
- All right, all right, all right.
- Funky little brothers. I talked to him.

1351
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:55,259
He says he ain't never gonna come down
here unless he's got police protection.

1352
01:42:55,341 --> 01:42:58,016
Last year, one of y'all niggers
stole one of his reindeer.

1353
01:43:05,228 --> 01:43:09,190
No, no. I say let's just go up there
and kill that motherfucker.

1354
01:43:10,873 --> 01:43:14,231
Man, me and Anthony gave out
a couple of things, but that was it.

1355
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:18,146
You gave toys and turkeys to people.
Then you got the hell outta Dodge.

1356
01:43:18,279 --> 01:43:22,480
Man. Y'all sayin' my man is
goin' around handin' out $100 bills...

1357
01:43:22,562 --> 01:43:24,872
and sayin' that
God Almighty gave it to him?

1358
01:43:24,961 --> 01:43:28,561
My cousin lives up there in Mount Vernon. He
says that Cleon's up there actin' a goddam fool.

1359
01:43:28,647 --> 01:43:30,717
That ol' high-profile ass
nigger.

1360
01:43:30,848 --> 01:43:32,646
Bought a brand-new Caddy.

1361
01:43:32,769 --> 01:43:34,408
Folk know he can't afford it.

1362
01:43:34,530 --> 01:43:38,002
- Look, man, I'm gonna go over there and talk to him.
- No, no, no. Fuck the talk!

1363
01:43:38,094 --> 01:43:40,892
I'm drivin' up there, and I'm gonna
take him out before he rats us out.

1364
01:43:40,975 --> 01:43:43,775
Look, Kirby.
I'm gonna handle everything, all right?

1365
01:43:43,897 --> 01:43:47,447
- I'm gonna straighten this shit out.
- All right.

1366
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:50,972
But if you don't take care of this,
Anthony, I promise you, I will.

1367
01:43:51,064 --> 01:43:53,181
I told you we didn't
need another man.

1368
01:43:53,265 --> 01:43:56,064
That's y'all's motherfuckin'
punk-ass friend!

1369
01:43:56,146 --> 01:43:59,458
People runnin' from their worries

1370
01:43:59,589 --> 01:44:01,786
While the judge and his juries

1371
01:44:03,192 --> 01:44:06,550
They take the law
that's part of the flaw

1372
01:44:06,675 --> 01:44:10,511
No. Oh, shit, Cleon!

1373
01:44:10,597 --> 01:44:12,590
Love, fallin', fussin' and a-cussin'

1374
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:14,194
Damn!

1375
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,517
The feelin' now is killin'

1376
01:44:19,005 --> 01:44:21,234
For peace no one is willin'

1377
01:44:22,566 --> 01:44:24,557
Kinda make you get that feelin'

1378
01:44:27,088 --> 01:44:28,922
Everybody's startin'

1379
01:44:30,451 --> 01:44:32,683
Use the pill and the dope

1380
01:44:34,575 --> 01:44:36,645
Educated fools

1381
01:44:37,937 --> 01:44:40,213
From uneducated schools

1382
01:44:44,023 --> 01:44:47,699
Right now we'd like to bring on a young man
who believes in doing things his own way.

1383
01:44:47,824 --> 01:44:50,977
And based on the way he kinda get next to
all of the folks who've seen him work...

1384
01:44:51,067 --> 01:44:52,581
his way has gotta be
pretty hip.

1385
01:44:52,669 --> 01:44:56,425
So let's lay some noise
on the mighty Al Green.

1386
01:45:03,396 --> 01:45:05,195
Apartment 13!

1387
01:45:06,318 --> 01:45:08,311
I'm so tired of bein' alone

1388
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,716
I'm so tied up on my own

1389
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,080
Won't you help me, girl

1390
01:45:13,163 --> 01:45:17,444
Just as soon as you can

1391
01:45:22,731 --> 01:45:24,848
Don't move, mister!

1392
01:45:24,973 --> 01:45:28,364
I been wantin' to get
next to you, baby

1393
01:45:28,494 --> 01:45:30,326
You see, sometime
I fold my arms, I say

1394
01:45:30,456 --> 01:45:33,815
- Ooo-ooo
- Mmm-hmm-mmm

1395
01:45:33,939 --> 01:45:36,328
Whoa-oh-oh

1396
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:38,929
Oh, baby, hey

1397
01:45:40,382 --> 01:45:44,015
Needing you has proven to be

1398
01:45:44,106 --> 01:45:47,498
To be my greatest dream
Yeah

1399
01:45:47,588 --> 01:45:50,901
- I'm so tired of being alone
- Oh, tired, baby

1400
01:45:53,112 --> 01:45:55,345
- Here's the rest of the fifties.
- Put it in there.

1401
01:45:57,595 --> 01:46:01,274
You know, I still feel fucked-up
about this whole situation.

1402
01:46:01,357 --> 01:46:05,319
Look, feelin' fucked-up don't help a goddam
thing and it ain't gonna bring nobody back.

1403
01:46:05,441 --> 01:46:08,961
- Shit!
- So, just worry about yourself. We just gotta get outta here.

1404
01:46:09,044 --> 01:46:13,245
- Come on.
- Say, man, you got everything?

1405
01:46:13,368 --> 01:46:15,244
Yeah, grab that bag.

1406
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:19,807
This is a bitch.

1407
01:46:19,933 --> 01:46:23,164
This is it, man.
This is it.

1408
01:46:23,295 --> 01:46:25,173
All we got to do, boy,
is make it to Mexico.

1409
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:27,732
We'll be fine.
We'll get us a villa, see?

1410
01:46:27,859 --> 01:46:30,420
And then, and buy a boat
and sail all around the gulf.

1411
01:46:30,501 --> 01:46:33,381
Everything will be fine.
We just gotta get the fuck outta here.

1412
01:46:33,503 --> 01:46:35,653
Yeah, maybe I can send
for Sarah once we get down there.

1413
01:46:35,784 --> 01:46:38,619
Well, anything's possible.
Come on.

1414
01:46:38,747 --> 01:46:41,138
Wait a minute.
Run, Anthony! Hyah!

1415
01:46:41,229 --> 01:46:44,540
Y'all get back!
Get away right there! Get off me!

1416
01:46:46,152 --> 01:46:48,509
Shit!

1417
01:46:48,594 --> 01:46:52,066
- You pity fool, you pity fool
- Fuck!

1418
01:46:52,155 --> 01:46:54,991
You better have some sympathy

1419
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:59,832
Yeah
'Cause there's educated people

1420
01:46:59,963 --> 01:47:03,514
Runnin' the lives of our society

1421
01:47:05,445 --> 01:47:07,006
Makin' up the rules

1422
01:47:08,721 --> 01:47:12,602
Mr Curtis, you have been
lawfully tried in this court...

1423
01:47:12,684 --> 01:47:14,917
and found guilty on all charges.

1424
01:47:15,006 --> 01:47:18,638
Do you have anything to say on your own
behalf before I pronounce sentence?

1425
01:47:18,769 --> 01:47:20,363
Uh...

1426
01:47:20,452 --> 01:47:23,410
no, ain't nothin' I say
gonna get me out of this.

1427
01:47:24,894 --> 01:47:28,251
But things were gettin' bad
for me, and...

1428
01:47:28,376 --> 01:47:30,846
I had to do what I had to do
to s... to survive.

1429
01:47:34,019 --> 01:47:35,931
Maybe it was wrong, but I...

1430
01:47:36,063 --> 01:47:38,623
I certainly didn't mean
for anybody to be hurt.

1431
01:47:38,703 --> 01:47:41,140
Uh, Your Honour,
please consider before sentencing...

1432
01:47:41,265 --> 01:47:44,100
that my client served his country proud
in the Marine Corps.

1433
01:47:44,229 --> 01:47:46,460
As a matter of fact, he was
a member of an elite unit...

1434
01:47:46,549 --> 01:47:48,541
a sergeant,
decorated with many medals.

1435
01:47:48,631 --> 01:47:52,593
In fact, one of those medals
was the, uh, Silver Star, for valour.

1436
01:47:52,674 --> 01:47:55,314
I realize that my client had
a difficult time adjusting when he...

1437
01:47:55,396 --> 01:47:58,072
Excuse me, Counsel.
I, too, was a marine...

1438
01:47:58,157 --> 01:48:01,791
and I served my country proudly
in World War Il, a real war, I may add.

1439
01:48:01,921 --> 01:48:03,719
- Yes, Your Honor...
- I'm not finished yet, please.

1440
01:48:03,842 --> 01:48:07,077
I received the Purple Heart
at Guadalcanal.

1441
01:48:07,205 --> 01:48:09,595
Now, this young man has obviously
forgotten some very...

1442
01:48:09,687 --> 01:48:13,808
fundamental things like decency
and dedication and honor...

1443
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:15,569
everything the corps taught us.

1444
01:48:15,691 --> 01:48:18,159
He is a disgrace to everyone
that has ever put on that uniform...

1445
01:48:18,293 --> 01:48:23,371
and I will not permit you or him to use
the Vietnam War as a cop-out here.

1446
01:48:25,059 --> 01:48:28,212
Anthony Curtis, for your
participation in this crime...

1447
01:48:28,341 --> 01:48:31,858
a crime that took the lives of several
innocent people, I do hereby...

1448
01:48:31,945 --> 01:48:35,062
sentence you to the custody of the
Attorney General of the United States...

1449
01:48:35,145 --> 01:48:37,501
for a period of 15 years to life.

1450
01:48:37,626 --> 01:48:40,189
Oh, my God.

1451
01:48:40,269 --> 01:48:44,186
These proceedings are concluded.
This court is adjourned.

1452
01:48:44,274 --> 01:48:47,472
"Life"? What the fuck
he mean "life"?

1453
01:48:47,556 --> 01:48:49,944
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

1454
01:48:50,035 --> 01:48:53,191
What the fuck he talkin' about, "life"?
Man, fuck you! Fuck you!

1455
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:55,151
- Hey!
- Oh, Anthony!

1456
01:48:55,281 --> 01:48:57,318
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

1457
01:48:57,403 --> 01:48:59,155
You, remove the prisoner
from the court!

1458
01:48:59,244 --> 01:49:02,202
- You hear me? - Fuck you! Fuck
you! - Restrain the prisoner!

1459
01:49:02,325 --> 01:49:05,525
Get him outta here! Let the record
show... Let the record show...

1460
01:49:05,647 --> 01:49:07,446
that a chair was thrown
at the judge.

1461
01:49:14,094 --> 01:49:15,893
Whoa, whoa

1462
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:26,177
If you see me
walkin' down the street

1463
01:49:26,304 --> 01:49:29,058
And I start to cry

1464
01:49:29,145 --> 01:49:31,536
Each time we meet

1465
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:36,908
Then walk on by

1466
01:49:40,433 --> 01:49:43,268
Walk on by

1467
01:49:45,437 --> 01:49:47,749
Make believe

1468
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,358
That you don't see the tears

1469
01:49:52,602 --> 01:49:55,277
You just let me grieve
in private

1470
01:49:55,364 --> 01:49:58,518
'Cause each time I see you

1471
01:49:58,608 --> 01:50:03,206
I just can't help myself
I think about how tight we used to be

1472
01:50:03,331 --> 01:50:07,485
I break down and cry

1473
01:50:07,574 --> 01:50:09,531
Oh, baby

1474
01:50:09,616 --> 01:50:12,210
Walk on by

1475
01:50:21,544 --> 01:50:24,505
Hmm-mmm-mmm

1476
01:50:30,191 --> 01:50:34,584
I just can't get over
losing you

1477
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:38,188
So if I seem

1478
01:50:38,278 --> 01:50:40,792
Broken in two

1479
01:50:43,201 --> 01:50:46,752
Please walk on by

1480
01:50:48,244 --> 01:50:50,759
Walk on by

1481
01:50:53,087 --> 01:50:55,524
Foolish pride

1482
01:50:55,648 --> 01:50:58,804
Is all that I have left

1483
01:50:58,932 --> 01:51:01,765
So let me hide

1484
01:51:01,853 --> 01:51:06,328
The tears and the sadness
you gave me

1485
01:51:06,457 --> 01:51:08,255
You put the hurt on me

1486
01:51:08,378 --> 01:51:10,177
You socked it to me, mama

1487
01:51:10,301 --> 01:51:14,979
When you said goodbye

1488
01:51:16,505 --> 01:51:19,818
So, please, walk on by

1489
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:24,987
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1490
01:51:27,634 --> 01:51:29,465
So do me a favour

1491
01:51:29,594 --> 01:51:32,954
And walk on by

1492
01:51:34,638 --> 01:51:36,471
So I'm beggin' you to

1493
01:51:36,559 --> 01:51:39,075
Walk on by

1494
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:40,834
Oh, yeah

1495
01:51:40,964 --> 01:51:43,762
And make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1496
01:51:45,687 --> 01:51:47,644
So I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you

1497
01:51:47,766 --> 01:51:49,963
To walk on by

1498
01:51:52,451 --> 01:51:55,605
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1499
01:51:58,456 --> 01:52:00,254
Oh

1500
01:52:00,377 --> 01:52:02,609
There's no dust in my eye

1501
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:04,652
Oh, no

1502
01:52:06,461 --> 01:52:08,260
Smoke ain't makin' me cry

1503
01:52:08,384 --> 01:52:10,945
No, no, no

1504
01:52:11,065 --> 01:52:13,980
It's the hurt
you put on me, yeah

1505
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:18,630
I don't want you
to see this man cry

1506
01:52:20,633 --> 01:52:25,265
Where is the love

1507
01:52:25,395 --> 01:52:34,959
Where is the love

1508
01:52:35,083 --> 01:52:37,235
Where is the love

1509
01:52:37,365 --> 01:52:39,596
Ooh, yeah, yeah

1510
01:52:39,726 --> 01:52:42,481
Where is the love

1511
01:52:42,567 --> 01:52:45,085
You said you'd give to me

1512
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:47,601
Soon as you were free

1513
01:52:47,693 --> 01:52:51,812
Will it ever be

1514
01:52:51,934 --> 01:52:56,730
Where is the love

1515
01:52:58,381 --> 01:53:02,978
You told me that you
didn't love him

1516
01:53:03,063 --> 01:53:07,776
And you were gonna say goodbye

1517
01:53:07,907 --> 01:53:12,745
But if you really
didn't mean it

1518
01:53:12,831 --> 01:53:18,352
Why did you have to lie

1519
01:53:18,434 --> 01:53:21,235
Where is the love

1520
01:53:21,317 --> 01:53:23,958
You said was mine
all mine

1521
01:53:24,078 --> 01:53:26,515
Till the end of time

1522
01:53:26,601 --> 01:53:30,482
Was it just a lie

1523
01:53:30,564 --> 01:53:35,164
Where is the love

1524
01:53:37,011 --> 01:53:41,721
If you had had a sudden
change of heart

1525
01:53:41,812 --> 01:53:46,571
I wish that you
would tell me so

1526
01:53:46,696 --> 01:53:51,374
Don't leave me hangin'
on these promises

1527
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:57,055
You've gotta let me know

1528
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,115
