[Man] Now, listen, Julie baby

3
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,500
It ain't natural
for you to cry at midnight

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,000
[Siren Wails]

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,800
It ain't natural for you to cry

6
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,600
When the midnight comes

7
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,500
Into the wee, small hours

8
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,100
Long 'fore the break of dawn

9
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Oh, Lord

10
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,300
- Mm-hmm

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,900
[Man Narrating]
The night started out with a bang.

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,700
A gunshot to the chest
on a drug deal gone bad.

13
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,900
All the elements
were in place for a long weekend...

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
heat, humidity, moonlight.

15
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,000
heat, humidity, moonlight.

16
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
I was good at my job.

17
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,500
There were periods where my hands
moved with a speed and skill beyond me.

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,700
But in the last year,
I'd started to lose that control.

19
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,100
Things had turned bad.

20
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
I hadn't saved anyone in months.

21
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,800
I just needed a few slow nights,
followed by a couple of days off.

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
- [Man] Ladder Four.
- We're there.

Respond to a 10-22.
Four-flight residential. 417 West 32.

77-David at 177 West 24.

25
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,000
A woman who says a roach crawled
in her ear. Can't get it out.

26
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,000
Says she's going
into cardiac arrest.

Man set his pants on fire.

28
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,600
- Bad burns.
- Move back. Which apartment?

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,500
- 5-A.
- Oh, Jesus, it's Mr. Burke.

30
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,500
[Panting]
Why is it always the top floor?

31
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,500
Goddamn.

No! No!

[Crying, Speaking Indistinctly]

34
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,600
No! No!

35

No! No! [Sobbing]

[Sobbing Continues]

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,800
Oh, God, they're here.

38
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,100
Shh, shh. Over there. [Sobbing]

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Mary, it's two hands. It's my dad.

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,600
We were just watching TV, and
he was sort of punching his chest...

41
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,800
- Step outside.
- Next, he locks the bathroom.

42
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,800
So I told him I was gonna
call you guys, and he said not to.

43
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,100
- When did he stop breathing?
- I don't know. Ten minutes.

44
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,600
Twenty. A woman on the phone
tried to tell us how to do C.P.R.

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
- Could you do something?
- We'll do what we can.

46
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,700
He was cryin'.
I never heard him cryin' before.

47
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,000
[Beeping] I need you to squeeze
this once every three seconds.

48
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,300
Clear! Clear!

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
- [Gasps]
- [Long Beep]

50
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,400
- Ma'am, I need you to step back.
- Clear! Clear!

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,000
[Screams] No more. Please don't.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,900
- Clear! Clear!
- Ma'am, step back.

53
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,600
[Crying] Daddy.

54
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,300
[Man] In the last year, I'd
come to believe in such things...

55
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,900
as spirits leaving the body
and not wanting to be put back.

56
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,300
Spirits angry at the awkward
places death had left them.

57
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,000
I understood how crazy
it was to think this way.

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,400
But I was convinced
that if I turned around...

59
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,900
I'd see Old Man Burke...

60
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,600
standing at the window...

61
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
watching...

62
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,100
waiting for us to finish.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,900
I'll take over.
Call E.R. and ask for an 83.

64
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,100
Sorry.

66
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,100
Do you have any music?

67
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,300
- What?
- Music.

68
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,000
I think it helps
if you play something he liked.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,900
John.

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,100
Play the Sinatra.

71
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
- What?
- Play the Sinatra.

72
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,400
What is it, Johnny?

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,300
As a man

74
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,500
Who has always had

75
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,800
- The wandering ways

76
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,200
Now I'm reaching back

77
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,400
- For yesterday
- [Beeping]

78
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,600
- [Beeping Continues]
- Okay, Frank, you can call it. 83.

79
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,200
- No, we can't. He's got a pulse.
- No shit?

80
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,900
- Is he gonna be all right?
- [Beeping]

81
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,000
His heart's beating.
Have 'em bring up a board.

83
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
No, no. No. No.

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Help your family.
Ride with your mother and brother.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,700
Help your family.
They need you more. Help yourself.

86
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,100
Now, Julie, there ain't
nothin' on my mind

87
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,900
More for the way than
what you're lookin' for

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,100
[Siren Wailing]

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,800
- For the family.
- And she done went and jumped at me

90
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,700
Lunged from behind the door

91
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,100
And looked into my eyes

92
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,300
[Frank] I had to concentrate to
keep my mind from wandering off...

93
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
on these short trips.

94
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,800
It was the neighborhood
I grew up in...

95
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,900
and where I'd worked most
as a paramedic.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,400
And it held more ghosts
per square foot than any other.

97
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,800
Your little
starstruck innuendos

98
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,500
Inadequacies and

99
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,800
Foreign bodies

100
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,200
And the sunlight shining through
the crack in the windowpane

101
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,200
[Men Arguing]

102
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Numbs my brain

103
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,200
Come on! Come on!
Both of you!

104
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,700
Your man doesn't look well. They
not gonna appreciate you inside.

105
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
- Nobody loves me, Griss.
- Just tellin' you things are backing up.

106
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,000
Griss, let us in.

107
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Whatever you say.

108
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,800
Oh, my foot!

109
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,300
Don't even slow down.
Just keep on moving.

110
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,500
Sir, you say you've been
snorting cocaine for three days...

111
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
and now you feel as if your heart
is beating too fast...

112
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,500
and you would like for us
to help you.

113
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,700
To tell you the truth,
I don't see why we should.

114
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,400
Correct me if I am wrong here,
if I'm mistaken.

115
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,100
Did we sell you the cocaine?
Did we push it up your nose?

116
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,600
- Oh, come on.
- Can I get a cup of water?

117
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,100
- Shut up, goddamn civilian!
- All I want is a cup of water!

118
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,500
[Woman] Oh, no. No, no,
nO, nO, nO, guys.

119
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,800
We're on diversion here. We're
not accepting any more patients.

120
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,200
The dispatcher should've let you
know that. I cannot do it. No.

121
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,100
We picked him up at 49th and 10th.
You're the closest.

122
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Where do you want me to put him?
You tell me.

123
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,300
He wanted to come here. He said
the nurses at Misery were the best.

124
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,900
- All I want is a cup of water!
- I'll kick someone out of three.

125
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,700
Excuse me. You're a kind man,
I can see that.

126
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,000
A man like you's not gonna deny a
poor, sick, dying, helpless man...

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
- a small cup of water.
- I have to stay with my patient.

128
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,200
Will you shut the fuck up?

129
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,800
Goddamn it. What the hell are you doing
to me? We're all backed up in here.

130
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,300
Look at this guy. Looks like he needs
the works. What's wrong with him?

131
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,800
- You should know. You pronounced him.
- You told me he was dead.

132
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,800
- Flatline.
- He got better.

133
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,100
[Sighs] I hate pronouncing people
dead over the phone.

134
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,500
Yeah. Better, huh? They're fixed
and dilated. This guy's plant food.

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,200
We stole a stretcher from X ray, so
put him in three next to the overdose.

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,000
All right, look. He's our lowest
priority now. He shouldn't even be here.

137
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,400
All this technology. What a waste.

138
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,200
[Griss] Leave that dope alone.
The doc'll be out in a minute.

139
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,100
- Could find out what's going on?
- Please, folks, step back.

140
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Please, folks, step back.
I've already told you two to step back.

141
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
- Mister...
- Don't make me take off my sunglasses.

142
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,600
First-time heart attack. He should've
gone to C.C.U. ten hours ago.

143
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,900
We got three bodies up there
just like the one you brought in.

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Over there, two AIDS patients.
One is 12 and filling up with fluids.

145
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Mother won't sign
the "Do Not Resuscitate."

146
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,300
"Mercy killing" doesn't
translate well in Spanish.

147
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,900
It's a sin to have to tube that kid.

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,100
We got three more O.D. s from this new
killerjunk they're calling Red Death.

149
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,500
What's in it?

150
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
It's a mix of heroin and I don't know
what else. An amino acid, maybe.

151
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
This stuff is so strong, they're
drinking it with grain alcohol.

152
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
You need ten times
the usual amount of Narcan.

153
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,700
And when they wake up, watch out
'cause they're liable to go nuts on you.

154
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,000
- He one of'em?
- That's Noel. He used to be a regular.

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I haven't seen him for a while.
He seized and almost coded.

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I gave him a hypertonic solution.

157
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He drank so much
his kidneys were taking out salt.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,100
- That's one for the textbooks.
- Doc, you're the greatest.

159
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,500
- You gotta help me.
- Can you give this guy water?

160
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,100
Noel, I am helping you.
You drink any more water, you could die!

161
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,300
[Woman] Hazmat, three's coding.
We got a flatline here.

162
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,800
Start C.P.R. Milagros, get me an epi.
Odette, wake up Dr. Stark.

163
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,800
Tell him we're gonna need him stat.
400 joules. Clear!

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,400
You want water? I'll give you water.

165

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Thanks for the light.

326
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,700
Here's your dinner. I wheel, you heal.

327
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,100
[Man] 6-2 David, at 38th and 2,
you'll find a three-car accident.

328
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,300
Two taxis and a taxi.

329
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,800
6-2 Henry, 6-2 Henry. 487 West 22.

330
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,700
Report of a very bad smell.
No further information.

331
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,700
Larry, swing over to 10th. We're gonna
have to run one of these calls.

332
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,200
- Relax, will ya?
- [Tires Screeching]

333
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,000
[Frank Narrating]
The biggest problem with not driving...

334
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,700
is that whenever there's a patient
in the back, you're also in the back.

335
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,300
- The door's closed. You're trapped.
- Let me breathe

336
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,300
5.00 or 6.00 in the morning is always
the worst time for me. Just before dawn.

337
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,300
Just when you've
been lulled into thinking...

338
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,800
it might be safe
to close your eyes for one minute.

339
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,400
That's when I first found Rose.

340
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,900
She was on the sidewalk, not breathing.

341
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,400
[Groans]
I'm not feeling very well, Larry.

342
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Let's say we go back
to the hospital, call it a night.

343
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,000
You got no sick time, Frank. No time
of any kind. Everyone knows that.

344
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,900
Take me back.
Put me to bed. I surrender.

345
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
We've done enough damage tonight.

346
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,400
You take things way
too seriously, Frank.

347
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,500
[Frank] You ever think
of doing anything else?

348
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Sure.

349
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,800
Taking my captain's exam next year.

350
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,400
Once the kids are in school,
Louise can go back to the post office.

351
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,300
I thought, "What the hell?
I'll start my own medic service."

352
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Out on the island, the volunteers
are becoming salaried municipal.

353
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
It's just a matter of time
and who you know.

354
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,800
Someday it's gonna be
Chief Larry calling the shots.

355
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,400
[Frank Narrating]
I'd always had nightmares.

356
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,300
But now the ghosts
didn't wait for me to sleep.

357
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I drank every day.

358
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,900
"Help others and you help yourself."

359
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,600
That was my motto.

360
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,700
But I hadn't saved anyone in months.

361
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,700
It seemed all my patients
were dying on me.

362
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,600
I'd waited,
sure the sickness would break.

363
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,500
Maybe the next call, maybe tomorrow,
the feeling would drop away.

364
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,900
More than anything else,
I wanted to sleep like that.

365
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,300
Close my eyes and drift away.

366
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,400
[Man On Radio] Zebra. 6-3 Zebra.

367
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Zebra.

368
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,000
Zebra, answer the radio.
Come on. I got one for you.

369
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,600
Pick up the radio and push the button
on the side and speak into the front.

370
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,500
Come on. Zebra?

371
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,100
- Zebra.
- Suicidal male bleeding...

372
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,800
corner of 44th and 8th.

373
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,400
No further information.

374
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,100
10-4.

375
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,200
[Horn Honks]

376
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,300
[Frank] We have a call, Chief.
Somebody's bleeding. 44th and 8th.

377
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
No, no. Brake! Brake!
It's the water. Turn around.

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
[Rock]

379
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,500
[Noel] Come on. Kill me!
Push it in! Do it!

380
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,300
Kill me! Huh? Come on.
Kill me. Just push it. Huh?

381
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm gonna cut my throat, man.

382
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,400
[Yells]

383
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,200
No, don't! Drop the bottle.

384
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,600
- Put down the bottle.
- He's crazy.

385
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,700
Really? You look pretty thirsty, Noel.
You want some water?

386
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,600
See, I can't do it.
I came out of the desert.

387
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,900
Those people left me in the sun to die.

388
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,900
You came out of the hospital.

389
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,900
You were tied down and hallucinating.

390
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,900
You got some bad chemicals in your head.

391
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,900
- There's medicine that'll fix that.
- No! No medicine.

392
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
- No medicine.
- He got ya.

393
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,500
Man wants to die? I know how
to kill that mother. Pop, pop.

394
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,700
- Oh, sh...
- Shit!

395
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,000
Noel! Noel!

396
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,700
Noel! Larry, call for backup.

397
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,700
[Larry] 6-3 Zebra,
10-85 forthwith, 44 and 8th.

398
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,000
[Man] Get out of the road,
you crazy bastard!

399
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Noel, you didn't let me finish.

400
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,700
We have rules against killing people
on the street, okay? It looks bad.

401
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,800
There's a special room
at the hospital for terminating.

402
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,700
It's a nice quiet room with a big bed.

403
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,900
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,500
Man, thank you, man.

405
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,200
Wait a minute. How?
How are you gonna kill me?

406
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,400
Well, you have a choice.
You can have pills, injection or gas.

407
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,200
- Pills. Definitely pills.
- [Man] You fucking asshole!

408
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,500
Tom Wolls, that crazy motherfucker.

409
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,200
- He used to be my partner.
- Frank.

410
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,000
This the guy you called about?
I know you.

411
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,100
- Nah, you don't know me.
- Oh, yes, I do, Pedro. I do.

412
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,200
- I know you. I know him.
- I don't think so.

413
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,700
You give my friend here
any more trouble, I'll kill ya.

414
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,600
- Yeah, at the hospital.
- What?

415
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,600
At the hospital.
He's gonna kill me in the hospital.

416
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,600
Forget the hospital. I'll kill you here.

417
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,500
This looks like a very bad man
I took in a couple of weeks ago...

418
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,300
who'd been holding two priests...
not one, two priests...

419
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,000
hostage with a screwdriver,
and I told him...

420
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,300
if he was ever caught
making trouble again...

421
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,000
- I'd kick the murdering life out of him.
- It's not worth it, Tom.

422
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,300
- He's surrendering.
- What?

423
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,000
- The war's over.
- Not mine.

424
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,300
Hey, Pedro, come here,
you little motherfucker.

425
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,300
I just want to talk to you...

426
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,800
give you a little
psychological first aid.

427
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,700
I'm gonna give you your first lesson
on how to be an American.

428
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,100
It's called "Eatin' My Shit."

429
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,700
- Come here.
- [Yells]

430
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,000
Tom, don't do it, Tom. Tom!

431
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,000
I have to take him to the hospital.

432
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,300
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- Get up here, motherfucker!

433
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,100
- That's enough!
- Take that!

434
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,600
There's a double shooting three blocks
down. 41 st and 8th, confirmed.

435
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,600
We'll do that. Larry. Larry. Larry!

436
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,400
- I'll take it. Motherfucker!
- That's enough.

437
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,100
I'll do that. I'll see you
over there, okay?

438
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,100
- What happened?
- [Siren Wailing]

439
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,300
Oh, man. Just walked up
and shot him. Not a word.

440
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,300
- Damn, that was cold.
- E.M.S. Move it.

441
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,600
- Where are you hit?
- [Panting, Grunting]

442
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,100
You see this shit, man?
Niggas put a hole in me.

443
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Yo, Tiger did this shit, yo.
And Money right here work for Outlaw.

444
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,000
[Grunting]

445
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,200
- We got a gang war about to start, yo.
- Take a deep breath.

446
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,900
[Coughing]

447
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,600
Major Tom! I'm going to Misery!
You take yours to Bellevue.

448
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,900
Okay, Frank, you take yours to heaven.
I'll take mine to hell. Let's go.

449
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,600
Get him on the board. Let's go.

450
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,000
You're gonna feel
a stick in your arm. Don't move.

451
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,800
Listen, I'm quitting, man.

452
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,500
I'm going in the army where it's safe.

453
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,000
[Grunting] I don't wanna die.

454
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,100
- No, I wanna die. I'm the one.
- You're not gonna die.

455
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,100
- What did you say?
- Shut up! You're going to die.

456
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,900
- Hold my hand, man.
- I can't. I gotta do the other arm.

457
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,900
- Hold my hand, man.
- Hold this.

458
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,300
If you let go, I swear I won't kill you.

459
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,900
[Grunting]

460
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,700
[Frank] It's all right. We're here.

461
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,500
Fuck.

462
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,200
He's not breathing. Call a code.

463
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
Noel, let's go.

464
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,600
Let's go!

465
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,300
Fucking Christ.

466
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,100
[Man] So here I am. And this junkie
got something jammed in his teeth.

467
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,500
Now, none of thesejunkies wanna give
mouth-to-mouth. It was a blow dryer.

468
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,900
So I pulls it out.
His body was cold except for his throat.

469
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,500
It had been blow-dried. Junkie had
second-degree burns of the tongue.

470
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,900
Did you ever give mouth-to-mouth?

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,800
A long time ago,
when I was your age, boy. Never again.

472
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,000
Chances are you end up
with a mouthful of puke. Junkie puke.

473
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'd do it if I had to.
It's part of the job.

474
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,300
- What about you?
- What?

475
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,500
You ever do mouth-to-mouth before?

476
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,900
- Once. On a baby.
- [Griss] Oh, babies.

477
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,200
Now, babies are a whole
different thing entirely.

478
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,700
Did I ever tell you about the time
that white woman approached me?

479
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,400
I said, "Ma'am, I'm a true
cocksman, and I don't mix my seed."

480
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,600
Only time you see me with a white woman
when I'm holdin' her for the police."

481
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,200
That's the truth.

482
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,900
You shouldn't smoke.

483
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,200
It's okay. They're prescription.

484
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,900
Works better with a little whiskey.

485
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Yeah, that's my brother's problem.
That's why he's passed out inside.

486
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,700
That's it!

487
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,600
I've had it! Can't take it anymore.

488
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,300
- You got... blood on...
- I know.

489
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,700
That boy you brought in,
he's, uh, shot, wasn't he?

490
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,700
Yeah.

491
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,300
He's dead, huh?

492
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Yes.

493
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,600
I think this place stinks.

494
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,300
- Our Lady of Misery.
- It's crazy in there.

495
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,300
What's the matter with that doctor...

496
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,700
who keeps mumbling and poking himself
in the eye whenever he talks to me?

497
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,300
He's working a double shift.

498
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,300
Well, my father's in there.
He's in a coma.

499
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,200
My mother, she's... she's going crazy.

500
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:18,100
It's like, uh, she's in a trance.

501
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,300
She should go home.

502
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,800
Yeah, well, I'd take her,
but somebody's got to stay here.

503
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,400
- Did you see him?
- [Mrs. Burke] It wasn't him.

504
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,400
You saw him?

505
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,700
They showed me someone. It wasn't him.
It wasn't my husband.

506
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Mrs. Burke, they'll take
care of him. You should go home now.

507
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,800
I should know my own husband.

508
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,800
They wouldn't let me see him.

509
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,600
Larry and I'll drop her home.
Help me get her to the ambulance.

510
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,100
Mom, they're gonna give you
a ride home. Come on. This way.

511
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,800
You want some coffee?

512
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,300
I have applesauce cake too.

513
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,700
- Right here. Right there.
- Oh.

514
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Thanks.

515
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,500
I'll call you if anything changes.

516
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,200
[Frank Narrating] Saving
someone's life is like falling in love.

517
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,400
The best drug in the world.

518
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,700
For days, sometimes weeks afterwards...

519
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,900
you walk the street
making infinite whatever you see.

520
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,900
Once, for a few weeks,
I couldn't feel the earth.

521
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,300
Everything I touched became lighter.

522
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,900
Horns played in my shoes.
Flowers fell from my pockets.

523
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,600
You wonder if you've become immortal...

524
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,800
as if you've saved
your own life as well.

525
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,600
God has passed through you.

526
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,800
Why deny it that for a moment there...

527
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,600
Why deny for a moment there
God was you?

528
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,100
Taking credit when things
go right doesn't work the other way.

529
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,400
When things go wrong, spreading
the blame is an essential survival tool.

530
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,100
"The elevator broke down."
"The boyfriend was crazy."

531
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,900
"I should've called in sick."
"The tube wouldn't go in."

532
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,900
"The God of Hellfire"
is not a role that anyone wants to play.

533
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,600
[Buzzing]

534
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
[Buzzing Stops]

535
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,600
- Good morning, Captain.
- What am I gonna do with this guy?

536
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,700
Pierce, I just got off
the phone with Borough Command.

537
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,900
Out of 12 shifts this month,
you've been late for nine, sick four.

538
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,600
That includes the shift where
you came in late, you went home early.

539
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,500
- I'm sick. I've been telling you.
- You're sick?

540
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
You're killing me, do you know that?

541
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,200
You've got no sick time left.
I mean, I was told to terminate.

542
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,300
It's okay. I'll just
get my things out of my locker.

543
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,500
Excuse me. It's not okay. l-l-I
never fired anybody in my life, man.

544
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,600
I'm sorry, Captain.
Don't take it too hard.

545
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,300
[Barking]

546
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,000
[Laughing]
Nobody tells me to fire anybody, ever.

547
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,000
I told them, "Stick it right
up your big one." Pardon me.

548
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,300
I said, "You wanna fire him?
Come on over and do it yourself."

549
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,300
You know they won't do it.
It's up to you. You've gotta be strong.

550
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,400
- Be a man.
- You think they give these to sissies?

551
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,200
Come on, kid. This is a weekend
of full moons. Nobody wants to work.

552
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,400
I mean, your partner
Larry's called in sick.

553
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,500
Okay, Larry Veeber. Stupid Stanley too.

554
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,400
Come on. I need bodies out there.
I got buses that gotta run.

555
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I had to put Marcus on 62-Young.

556
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,600
Hey. Hey. You know he's not
supposed to work two nights in a row.

557
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,600
- You know what we're in for with that?
- You swore you'd fire me...

558
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,900
if I came in late again.

559
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,500
- I'll fire you tomorrow.
- [Pounds Desk]

560
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,700
Even better than that,
what was I thinking about?

561
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,900
I could forward you
some sick time. How about a week?

562
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,200
A week's not gonna do it.
A week's not gonna do it.

563
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,900
- Your saying no, it ain't gonna do it.
- [Pounds Desk]

564
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,700
You're going out with Marcus. Okay?

565
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
Duty calls you, kid.
The city needs you. Please.

566
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,700
I'll front you sick time.
I'll make it up to you. Honest to God.

567
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Look at me.
The next time I see you, I'll fire you.

568
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,900
- I can bark too.
- Pierce, you can do it all.

569
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,200
I never said
I could bark better than you.

570
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,400
Go and help... Go and help
the people of New York. Go ahead.

571
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Get out there and mop them up
for me. Go ahead. Do yourjob.

572
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,700
- Do yourjob. You're the best.
- [Woman] Put down that crack stem.

573
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,900
Put down that crack stem
and drop your jug of sin...

574
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,400
your high-heeled skirts
and your stock dividends...

575
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,700
your patent leather underwear,
televised suicides...

576
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,500
lap dancers in leotards
in delicatessens.

577
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,300
And the Lord said, "If you can find
one that isn't a sinner... just one...

578
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,800
- then I will spare the city."
- Lord, mother of man.

579
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,200
Boy, you look like hell.
What you drinking?

580
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,000
Captain almost
fired me tonight. I'm on my way out.

581
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,000
- [Chuckling]
- Anytime now.

582
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,200
Nobody gets fired, son. Look at me.

583
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,500
The most they might do
is transfer you to the Bronx.

584
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,900
Boy, you look like you aged about
ten years since I rode with you last.

585
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,500
I ain't feeling so hot.

586
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,000
I've been seeing the ghosts.

587
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,800
- You mean the people we lost?
- Yeah.

588
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,400
If they got to go,
got to go. God bless 'em.

589
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,100
You ever notice people
who see shit are always crazy? Mm-hmm.

590
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Scientific fact.

591
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,300
- I think the worst is over.
- Oh, no, son.

592
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,400
It can always get worse.
See, you can't change what's out there.

593
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Only where you're coming from.

594
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,000
So you got to let
the good Lord... Thank you, Jesus...

595
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,400
take over in here.

596
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,900
[Woman] 6-2 Young.
Let's go, 6-2 Young. Answer the radio.

597
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Marcus, it's Love.
I haven't heard her in months.

598
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,500
Well, no, she only works when I'm on.

599
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,300
I makes her wait. Drives her crazy.

600
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,600
- You and Love went on a blind date?
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,100
- She hit you with a bottle?
- Why you gotta bring that up?

602
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,200
She loves me the way no woman ever has.

603
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,500
6-2 Young, I don't
have time for your games.

604
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,200
Now, answer me or do
I have to come out there myself?

605
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,500
Oh, sookie, sookie. now. Rough.

606
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Now, see, I usually
don't do calls before my coffee...

607
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,900
but I think this'll
be good for you, son.

608
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,500
- 6-2 Young is here, baby.
- [Laughing]

609
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,000
And I'm a take care of you.

610
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,800
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

611
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,500
Come on, white boy.

612
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,300
'Cause Big Daddy Marcus
is alive and on arrival, baby.

613
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,200
I'm not your baby, Young.
I'm not your mother either.

614
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,700
You're going to a cardiac arrest.
30th and 11 th, northeast corner.

615
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,400
It's a club. Take the back entrance.

616
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,200
All right, 10-4, sweet mama.
You feeling better, Frank?

617
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,200
- I feel worse.
- Oh, that's good, boy.

618
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,700
- This here is for you.
- [Siren Wailing]

619
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,300
I hope we're not too late from you
folks holding us up here. Excuse me.

620
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,300
Right this way.

621
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,800
[Alternative Rock]

622
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,200
Get the hell out of my way.

623
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,200
Okay, what happened?

624
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,700
- Tell me he's gonna be all right.
- No, he dead.

625
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,600
- We just signed our first record deal.
- Look, he dead, son.

626
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Ain't nothing we can
do about it. Come on, Frank. That's it.

627
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,000
- [Woman] What do you mean he's dead?
- [Quietly] He's not dead.

628
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,600
It's a heroin overdose.
Let's break out the Narcan.

629
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,600
He's dead, unless you folks wanna stop
bullshitting me and tell it straight.

630
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,700
Then, the good Lord willing,
we'll try and bring him back.

631
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
He broke up with his old lady.

632
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,800
- We were just seeing other people.
- Oh, she broke his heart.

633
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,100
- Shut up, asshole! Nobody asked you!
- Was I talking to you?

634
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,600
Dick, shut up!

635
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,500
I'm still waiting
and this young man here is still dead.

636
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,300
- You wanna leave here in a body bag?
- You'll end up like him, dick!

637
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,700
- Shut up!
- He's been snorting that Red Death.

638
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,000
It's been going on for,
like, four days now.

639
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,100
I rebuke the spirit of drugs
in the name of Jesus. What's his name?

640
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,300
- I.B. Bangin'.
- What you mean I.B. Bangin'?

641
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,600
- I.B. Bangin'.
- What kind of name is I.B. Bangin'?

642
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,700
- I don't know his real name.
- It's Frederick Smith.

643
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,700
- [Marcus] Okay, Freddy...
- It's Frederick.

644
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,100
Okay, I.B. Bangin', we're
gonna bring you back from the dead.

645
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,300
Now, I want everybody here to
grab the hand of the person next to you.

646
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,500
Come on now. We ain't got much time.

647
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,900
And look up towards the heavens.

648
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,100
Dear Lord, here I am again...

649
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,400
asking one more chance for a sinner.

650
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,300
Please, Lord, bring back
I.B. Bangin', Lord.

651
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,200
You have the power, Jesus.
You have the might.

652
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,200
You have the super light
to spare this worthless man.

653
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,300
- My God! Frederick!
- Rise up, I.B. Bangin'...

654
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,000
and start your life anew!

655
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,000
Oh, thank you, Lord.

656
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,200
- What happened?
- You fucking died, you stupid bastard.

657
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,900
- I warned you.
- Damn, you guys are good.

658
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:21,600
The first step is Love.
The second is Mercy.

659
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,700
That guy I brought in yesterday,
post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

660
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Burke? You're not gonna believe it.
He's showing cognitive signs.

661
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,400
It started with spontaneous respiration.
Now he's fighting to pull out the tube.

662
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,600
He had to be sedated. He's in CAT scan.
There's no room in I.C.U.

663
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
- What do you think?
- Who knows?

664
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,500
It's lower brain stem activity at this
point. The heart refuses to stabilize.

665
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,600
You know, he coded
11 times since he got here.

666
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,600
But the guy's a fighter.

667
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,600
Every time the Valium wears off,
he starts yanking on the restraints.

668
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,600
The family know?

669
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,900
I wanted to bring them in
to see if he'd respond to voices.

670
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,900
But there was no one
in the waiting room.

671
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,900
This guy's daughter
was in my face all night.

672
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,900
Finally, I got something
positive to tell her, she's gone.

673
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,900
You put poison in your veins,
and now that you're breathing again...

674
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,100
you can't wait to say "Thank you,"
and get back out to poison shopping.

675
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,900
Well, since we saved your life,
could you do us a favor...

676
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,900
and stop breathing
in another city next time?

677
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,900
I ever tell you about
that time years ago...

678
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,500
I was on this ledge uptown
trying to pull this damn psycho inside?

679
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,500
The guy jumped and you almost fell?
No, you never told me that story.

680
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,500
[Chuckling] No, you never listened.

681
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,800
I put everything I had into saving
this dumb-ass, low-life suicidal...

682
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,400
that when he went down,
it was like I wanted to go with him.

683
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,400
That happened once in Ireland.

684
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,700
This girl jumped off the cliffs
of Moher and the wind blew her back up.

685
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,600
- The wind blew her back up?
- Yeah, the wind.

686
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,300
- No, that was Jesus, son.
- It was also the wind.

687
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,700
The wind, my black ass. That was Jesus.

688
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,600
Don't tell me about the Good Book.

689
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,500
I'll preach heaven and beat the hell
out of you. Don't tell me that now.

690
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,600
I was going, son.

691
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,500
But if someone up on high... Thank you,
Jesus... hadn't have pulled me in...

692
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,700
Would you turn left here?
I wanna make a stop.

693
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,500
The point is, everybody go through
a stretch where folks gonna die on you.

694
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,800
Just don't meditate on it.

695
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,900
I say open up the window

696
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,800
I'll be right back.

697
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,300
And let me breathe

698
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
I say open the window

699
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,900
- And let me breathe
- It's Frank Pierce from the ambulance.

700
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,200
I brought your father into the hospital.

701
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,300
- I just learned some news.
- [Mary] I'll be right down.

702
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,800
I cried for ya

703
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,500
He's better, isn't he?

704
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,000
Well, the doctor says
he's showing some movement.

705
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,600
It's still early. It might mean nothing,
but I thought you'd wanna know.

706
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,400
- I cried for ya
- I sensed it when I heard your voice.

707
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,000
You-You look so different.

708
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,500
Oh. [Laughing] It's awful, isn't it?

709
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,200
It's like Night
of the Living Cheerleaders.

710
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,700
No, I think it looks good.

711
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,400
I was going nuts in that waiting room.
I came back to check on my mom.

712
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,800
- How is she?
- She's sleeping.

713
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Sleeping.

714
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,700
I was just gonna get some food.
Pizza. I thought maybe we...

715
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,800
You can't kill my father that easy.
He's a real fighter, like with me.

716
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,700
He hasn't talked to me
in three years. But it's okay.

717
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,600
Sometimes you just have
to put things behind you.

718
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,700
I gotta be getting back. Hey. Hey!

719
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,700
It'll be tough to get a taxi here.
We can give you a ride if you like.

720
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,700
Okay.

721
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,500
Who that?

722
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,000
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest
I brought in last night.

723
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:06,000
I told her we'd give her a ride back.
Her father's showing signs of improving.

724
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,500
Oh, Frank, you got it bad, son.
So much worse than what I thought.

725
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,600
- We gotta get something to eat.
- God, help us. He's hungry.

726
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,100
These are the days

727
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,000
You might fill with laughter

728
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,000
Until you beg

729
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,700
These days you might feel
a shaft of light

730
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:36,200
Make its way across your face

731
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,400
And when you do

732
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,500
You'll know how it was meant to be

733
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,300
See the signs know their meaning

734
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,300
It's true

735
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,300
You'll know how it was meant to be

736
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,900
Hear the signs
and know they're speaking

737
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
To you

738
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,100
To you

739
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,000
Dad?

740
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,000
Can you hear me?

741
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,000
It's Mary.

742
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,000
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me, Dad.

743
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,900
[Squeals] He squeezed my hand.

744
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,400
He's moving, Doctor. He grabbed my hand.

745
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,300
Come on, Dad. Show 'em.
Come on. See? See?

746
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,600
I'll be damned. It's movement.
Just not sure how voluntary it is.

747
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,400
[Mary] No, he heard me.

748
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,300
Come on, Dad. Yeah.

749
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,200
Oh! Nurse Crupp.

750
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,400
Nurse Crupp! Ten milligrams of Valium!

751
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,600
- Get over here.
- [Beeping]

752
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,500
- Where's that Valium?
- Why don't we step out for a while...

753
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,500
- wait till this passes.
- Make sure he's breathing.

754
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,600
[Beeping Continues]

755
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,900
He wants to pull that tube out.

756
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,300
It's pretty painful.
That's why they keep him sedated.

757
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,800
- But it's a good sign.
- Are you sure?

758
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,800
I know my father
would hate being tied down.

759
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,000
He wouldn't even go to the dentist.

760
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,900
That's how it's done.

761
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,700
You have to keep the body going
until the brain and the heart...

762
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,700
recover enough to go on their own.

763
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,400
He's better though, right?

764
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,700
He's better.

765
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,600
I'm sorry. It's just...

766
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,100
It's important to me.
I mean, a week ago...

767
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,600
I was wishing he was dead.

768
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,700
And now, I wanna hear
his voice just once more.

769
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,900
- You know what I mean?
- [Door Swings Open]

770
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,300
[Marcus]
Went over to Ray's and got this.

771
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,700
Must be a place reserved in hell
for somebody who charges $ 1.50 a slice.

772
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,700
Anything comes up, I'll call you.

773
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,400
- Bon appetit. - Thanks.
- Thank you, Marcus.

774
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,800
Oh, thank... I'm not really hungry.

775
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,300
You know, my father's
a really wonderful man.

776
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,800
There was nobody he wouldn't help.

777
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,700
You know that crazy guy, Noel,
who I gave water to last night?

778
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,800
He lived at our house for almost a year.

779
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,100
Total stranger he'd do anything for.

780
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,100
His own family, though... [Scoffs]

781
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,400
It's best not to... dwell.

782
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
Yeah.

783
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,900
It's good pizza, huh?

784
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,600
Mmm, it's not as good as, uh, Nino's.

785
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,600
You remember that pizza place, Mimi's,
on 10th, maybe 15 years ago?

786
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,500
When you ordered a pie, it came with
a little plastic Madonna in the middle.

787
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,700
Saint Anthony, yeah.
You from the neighborhood?

788
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,600
- I grew up on 43rd, went to Holy Cross.
- Really?

789
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,600
I went to Sacred Heart.
Where'd you go to high school?

790
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,600
Well, you know, Mary,
we moved out after that. Upstate.

791
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,200
Yeah. Like everybody else, except us.

792
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,100
- So, your parents... Good.
- They're fine.

793
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,500
My old man's a bus driver,
and Mom a nurse.

794
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,200
Sort of born to it, I guess.

795
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,700
- You married?
- Uh, no.

796
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,700
I was.

797
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,700
Hard to explain.

798
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,000
[Sighs] She had a hard time
adjusting to, uh...

799
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,000
Well, maybe-maybe it was my fault too.

800
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,600
- Cocksucker! Don't be touchin'me!
- [Crashing Sound]

801
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,100
Is it always this bad in here?
How does anybody survive?

802
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,100
- Gosh.
- It's been bad lately, it's always bad.

803
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,900
- [Shouting Continues]
- How long have you been doing this?

804
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,100
Five years.

805
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,000
Wow. You must've seen some things, huh?

806
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,100
Well, no. I mean, you sort
of learn to block it out, you know?

807
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,900
It's like, um... like cops

Sir, I am going to give you medicine
that is still very experimental.

our astronauts have been using it...

on your forehead, like this.

And in about a minute,
you will have to relax.

You will lose
all your suicidal feelings.

1339

It's very important that you wear
the patch for at least 24 hours.

And keep checking the mirror.

1341

If the patch turns green,
you have to see a doctor immediately.

[Man] Jump! Let him fuckin' go!

1458
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,700
- Let him die!
- Let him go!

1459
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,400
So, Frank.

1460
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:39,400
[Breathing Heavily] Am I gonna live?

1461
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:42,200
- You're gonna live.
- Frank.

1462
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:45,100
That ten dollars you owe me?

1463
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,400
- Yeah?
- Keep it.

1464
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:50,100
I've been thinkin'
about things, you know?

1465
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,900
Oh, you guys gave me lots
of time to meditate on the future.

1466
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,900
What'd you do, huh? Stop for Chinese
on the way over here?

1467
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,400
I was tired. I needed a coffee.

1468
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,200
What about Kanita?

1469
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,500
Dead.

1470
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:14,800
That's, uh... That's too bad.

1471
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:18,300
Hmm. See, Frank...

1472
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,900
make some money,
fine-lookin' lady on your arm...

1473
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,600
then everybody wants to take a piece.

1474
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,800
Yeah, there's some kid...

1475
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,300
who I wouldn't let
wash my Mercedes, comes to the Oasis...

1476
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,600
starts shootin' at me.

1477
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,900
The Red Death Gang.
Bunch of 12-year-olds.

1478
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,900
I thought I could make it
on the balcony, like Tiger.

1479
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,500
But he's fat. Falls faster. That's why.

1480
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,200
I'm tryin' to watch my weight,
and look what happens.

1481
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,300
[Laughs, Groans]

1482
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:54,200
Goddamn, that's hot! [Groans]

1483
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,500
[Laughing] Bring it on! Bring it on!

1484
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,400
You can't kill me, duck-ass kids!

1485
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:04,100
Oh, yeah. [Groans]

1486
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:08,600
Ooh. Look at that. Look at that.

1487
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:13,100
Look at that. Hey, isn't that beautiful?

1488
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,800
[Laughing] Isn't that beautiful?

1489
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,800
Oh, when the fires start to fall...

1490
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,000
them that's strongest rule it all!

1491
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,000
Oh!

1492
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:32,400
I love this city!

1493
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:35,500
[Fireworks Exploding]

1494
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,900
[Both Yelling]

1495
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:52,000
[Grunting, Straining]

1496
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:58,300
Good thing we clipped you in,
huh, Frank?

1497
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,400
What about me? Who buckled me in?

1498
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,400
- I thought you did.
- Nah, I thought you did.

1499
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,400
- I'm sorry about that, sir.
- Yeah, right.

1500
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,500
Aah! Stop jerkin' my pole!

1501
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,100
[Cheering]

1502
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:14,800
[Cy] l-I got a fence up my ass, all
right? I need something for the pain.

1503
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,800
[Woman]
We'll get you another sedative.

1504
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,000
And somebody'll be by to take you to the
O.R., hopefully sometime this morning.

1505
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,200
Hopefully?
Hopefully sometime this morning?

1506
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:25,100
Oh, Frank. Frank. Psst.

1507
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,100
You saved my life.

1508
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,200
Yeah, I know.

1509
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:36,000
Nurse Crupp, we're gonna need
some Valium here. He's waking up again.

1510
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,700
- Where's that Valium?
- Coming.

1511
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,400
Frank, give me a hand over here.
I gotta get something between his teeth.

1512
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:47,100
- [Burke] Don't! Don't do it!
- Valium's in.

1513
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
How many times
have you shocked him tonight?

1514
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:55,500
Fourteen. Finally got him
a room up in I.C.U.

1515
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,000
He should be up there in a couple hours.

1516
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:02,500
What are you gonna do, have somebody
follow him with a defibrillator?

1517
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,400
That's a good one, Frank. No,
but we might surgically implant one...

1518
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,600
around the shoulder over here,
'bout the size of my thumb.

1519
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,200
Two electrodes connected to the heart.

1520
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,200
Sends a shock whenever he needs it.

1521
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:16,900
Or we could just send him home with
a defibrillator. He could do it himself.

1522
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,200
[Laughter Continues]

1523
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,500
I know it ain't funny
It ain't funny at all, baby

1524
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,700
To land in the cool room, man

1525
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,000
Look.

1526
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:50,300
Last night I was weak,
and it won't happen again.

1527
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:55,100
All that shit I was sayin'
was just 'cause I was stoned.

1528
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,200
- Just forget it.
- No problem.

1529
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,600
Thanks for letting me crash.

1530
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,500
It was the best sleep
I've had in months.

1531
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,900
I used some of your soap.

1532
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,400
Did you see my father?

1533
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:16,300
You know, the doctor said that, uh...

1534
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,800
that his brain's
startin' to come around.

1535
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:22,200
They're just waitin'
for his heart to stabilize.

1536
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:25,800
I don't know who to believe.
[Chuckles]

1537
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,800
Can I bring you back something to eat?

1538
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,400
A falafel or some pizza?

1539
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,200
No, we just ate.

1540
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:40,200
[Sighs] I keep thinking about
how tough my father was.

1541
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,700
Now I know he had to be like that...

1542
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,700
to make us tough.

1543
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,500
'Cause this city...

1544
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,900
it'll kill you
if you're not strong enough.

1545
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:59,100
No, the city doesn't discriminate.

1546
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,800
- It gets everybody.
- [Siren Chirps]

1547
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:08,400
I gotta go. Another call.

1548
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,700
We're all dying, Mary Burke.

1549
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,300
[Siren Wails]

1550
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,400
Get ready, Frank.

1551
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,400
Missed a drug shooting
while you were dicking around in there.

1552
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,400
Gonna be trauma tonight, baby.

1553
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,600
As long as we keep moving.
No standing still.

1554
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:58,300
I'm so bored with the U.S.A.
Well, what can I do

1555
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,900
Look at your screen! Give us some blood!

1556
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,100
66-X ray, a man at the bus terminal...

1557
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,900
shot three years ago says his arm hurts.

1558
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:31,700
I'm so bored with the U.S.A.
Well, what can I do

1559
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,000
Come on, Tom. Pick up a job.

1560
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,900
You want some bum in the bus terminal?
We'll wait for a real call.

1561
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,100
- Let's get in a fight then.
- Who with?

1562
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,800
Keep driving. Keep moving. No stopping.
We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.

1563
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:50,400
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust
something! Let's bomb something!

1564
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,700
What do you wanna break?

1565
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,000
- Let's break some windows!
- Why?

1566
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,500
Destruction! Distraction!
I feel the need!

1567
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,700
You need a reason, Frank. You just don't
go around breaking people's windows.

1568
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:01,800
- That's anarchy.
- What's the reason, Tom?

1569
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,800
All right, let me think.
Oh, look at this.

1570
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:08,200
Classic cabbie move. Hey, swami!

1571
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:11,400
It's called a crosswalk! You're supposed
to stop before it, not on it!

1572
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:14,900
You Senegalian raghead! Motherfucker!

1573
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,000
I know who to work over.

1574
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,600
Him!

1575
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:38,800
This guy's been terrorizin'
the neighborhood for weeks...

1576
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:41,700
ever since he got out of jail,
wreaking general havoc...

1577
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,700
contributing to
the bad name of the place.

1578
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,900
You know, the term
"menace to society" was made up for him!

1579
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,400
- He's crazy. He can't help it.
- Oh, yeah?

1580
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,200
Well, why don't they put him away?

1581
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,800
Prisons don't want him.

1582
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,300
I took him to the hospital yesterday.
I gave him a cup of water.

1583
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,600
I was very nice to him.
And here he is again.

1584
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:06,200
Oh! Look at that!

1585
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:08,400
Tell me that's a crazy person.

1586
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,900
Huh? Every move is calculated!

1587
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,800
He knows exactly what he is doing.

1588
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:17,000
Frank, this is the guy.

1589
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,800
I've been after him for weeks.
He's quick, though.

1590
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,800
He runs like a rat.
He'd be tough for one person.

1591
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,600
- But with the two of us, you know...
- Okay, what do I do?

1592
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,600
Okay, I'm gonna get out here.

1593
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:30,300
If he sees me,
he'll run. He doesn't like me.

1594
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,400
You start talkin' to him
about baseball or something.

1595
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:36,000
I'll sneak around behind him
and get down...

1596
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,000
and then you push him.

1597
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:40,600
And when he falls, we get him.

1598
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:45,100
- That's ridiculous.
- Believe me. It always works.

1599
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,300
Okay?

1600
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,500
Havin' fun now!

1601
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:00,600
That's a hell of a swing
you got there, Noel.

1602
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,500
- I'm thinking Mattingly in his prime.
- Mattingly ain't shit.

1603
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,300
Me, I swing like Reggie.

1604
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:08,600
Huh? Mr. October, number three.

1605
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,600
Game six of the World Series.

1606
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:12,600
All right!

1607
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:15,500
You hit it. Come on, take a crack at it.

1608
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,500
It's okay.

1609
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:22,100
Come on, hit it!

1610
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:25,200
- [Laughs]
- I better not.

1611
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:27,600
Go ahead. Give it a go.

1612
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:29,900
Try it.

1613
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,900
Yeah?

1614
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,200
Okay. What the hell.

1615
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:41,500
The next year, tiebreaker
for the division in Boston.

1616
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,500
The Yanks down two to nothing.
Bucky Dent steps to the plate.

1617
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,900
- Lucky-Fucky-Bucky, man.
- The pitch: high heater.

1618
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Bucky knows what's comin'. He steps in.

1619
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:55,200
Smash! Over the Green Monster! Yeah!

1620
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:59,000
Frank! What the...

1621
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,400
