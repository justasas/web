1
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,911
Man, what's takin' you so long?
It's cold as a motherfucker out here.

2
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:22,045
I had to get the last stop.
Quiet, punk.

3
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:25,255
- I'll shut your hairy ass up, man.
- Come on, man. I'm freezin'
my fuckin' nuts out here!

4
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:27,258
Mush, motherfucker, mush!

5
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:36,822
Ant, Juanita gave you
some of that pussy yet?

6
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,203
- Man, get out of here, man.
- What?

7
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,789
Man, I thought we was homies, man.
I'm just askin'.

8
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:46,001
Well, why you gotta be
askin' me all that? I mean...

9
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,009
I'm just lookin' out for you.

10
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:52,138
All I'm sayin', man, fine as she is,
she should be giving you something.

11
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,938
I bet you ain't even
smelled the pussy, eh?

12
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:58,104
You two realize that soon
we're gonna be out of school, right?

13
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,156
- Oh, sure.
- After four long years
of that shit, man.

14
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,457
I can't fuckin' wait to get out. That's
all I've been thinkin' about, man.

15
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:08,749
You know? I just be thinkin' about like
what am I gonna do afterwards, right?

16
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,213
You know, I can dig some travelling.

17
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:14,223
Nigger, you sound like
you rich or somethin'.

18
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,604
Hear this nigger?
He ain't even got a fuckin' job.

19
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,691
- I know.
- Man, you better take your ass off
to college, man, I'm tellin' you...

20
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:24,150
before Uncle Sam grab your ass like
he gonna do this stupid motherfucker.

21
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:26,825
Oh, bullshit, Skip, man.
Ain't nobody gonna grab me.

22
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:31,337
Jose, a recruiter
can see your dumb ass a mile away.

23
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:34,676
Look at you.
You're a recruiter's dream. You a 1-A.

24
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:37,517
A one-way ticket to motherfuckin'
Vietnam if I ever saw one.

25
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:40,806
That's why I'm goin' to Hunter College.
You goddam right.

26
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:43,023
I ain't fightin'
no white man's war. Shit.

27
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,031
Them Vietcongs, chongs, whatever
the fuck, ain't done shit to me.

28
00:05:46,116 --> 00:05:49,072
I don't even know
them motherfuckers, man.

29
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:51,781
And I ain't afraid of no war.

30
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,996
Man, what the fuck you been smokin'?

31
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,840
Look, y'all might think
I'm crazy, but...

32
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,840
I just wanna do somethin'
that's different.

33
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:03,886
Yeah, well, gettin' your
fuckin' head blown off is different.

34
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:06,605
Hey, man, turn that shit down!
And slow this motherfucker down!

35
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:10,073
- Ain't nobody in a hurry
to go to school.
- Man, leave that shit up.

36
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,795
You know I fucked Monica, right? Her
mama came in, caught us the other day.

37
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:21,049
Came in, seen my dick,
jumped in the bed too.

38
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:23,178
- Later on, you chump suckers.
- Ah, fuck you.

39
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,182
- Your mama!
- Punk ass, jivin' around.

40
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:27,851
- Hey, this is for you,
Anthony, right here.
- Close this motherfuckin' door.

41
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:30,024
It's cold as hell out here.
Sit your nasty ass down.

42
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:42,502
Oh, hey. How you doin'?

43
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,794
You up kinda early.

44
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,131
Um, I heard your truck.

45
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:50,015
Seems like you hear my truck
every mornin'.

46
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:53,983
Well, uh, morning
is the best time to study, so...

47
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,448
You should, uh, try workin'
on your first boyfriend.

48
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:01,489
I'm too busy studyin'
to be worryin' about boys.

49
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:06,004
Your sister up?

50
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,760
Uh, Sleeping Beauty?
Yeah.

51
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,023
Look, uh, tell her I said hey.
See ya.

52
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,659
- Good morning, Anthony.
- Oh, hey.

53
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:26,376
- I thought you were sleeping.
- You woke me up.

54
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:29,631
- Uh, so you goin' to school today?
- Mmm.

55
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,718
I could lay in bed all mornin'.

56
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:34,678
Oh. See, now...
Now that'd be real nice.

57
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:38,556
- Don't even think about it.
- Well, look, uh...

58
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:41,025
I'm gonna get on out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

59
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:44,532
- Okay.
- See ya.

60
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,164
Keep on pushin'

61
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:55,423
Keep on pushin'

62
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:59,343
- I'll be down there later on.
- Got to keep on pushin'

63
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,643
I can't stop now

64
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,652
Hard shoe.
Come here, hard shoe.

65
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,775
Come here, man.
What's up? What's up?

66
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:09,954
Listen, I want you...
I want you to tell Kirby I want 645.

67
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:12,540
- Straight, now. Listen. And, uh...
- Straight.

68
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,629
- We've been rollin' here.
- Come on, man. I ain't got time.

69
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:16,626
- Let me get the money.
- I want you to be back here tonight...

70
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:19,556
- Man, straighten your hat out.
- With my money, you little motherfucker.

71
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:23,970
- What's goin' on, baby?
- All right, baby.
- All right, cat daddy. All right.

72
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:26,647
- Hey, Anthony. How you doin'?
- Hey.

73
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:30,820
You know, you brought me luck the other
day. So look, ten of that's for you.

74
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:34,740
- See? Now, that's how it goes.
- Hey, now.

75
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:37,036
- L-I'm gonna use the same number too.
- Don't forget me, man.

76
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:40,341
What's goin' on?
Hey, what's goin' on?

77
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,259
Hey there, Jellybean.
What's goin' on?

78
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:58,867
Hey, what's goin' on?
How you been?

79
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:01,715
Kirby back there?
All right. Cool.

80
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:07,092
- Go on, get that shot. Get that shot.
- All right, thanks, youngblood.

81
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,718
Hey there, Peanut! What's goin' on?
What's up there? What...

82
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:17,193
Blood.

83
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,080
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Kirby's back there in the back, man.

84
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,334
Put that in Brooklyn
and get ahold of that fuckin' Spyder.

85
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,585
- Okay, man.
- Hey, brother.

86
00:09:26,676 --> 00:09:29,253
- Aw, man, take them.
- Yeah, yeah.

87
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:33,052
Here's the numbers and the cash.

88
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:39,191
- We got five.
- Hubba hubba!

89
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,821
Ain't you supposed to be
duck huntin' with your daddy?

90
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,710
Oh, yeah.
We gonna go next weekend.

91
00:09:56,522 --> 00:10:00,143
- Aw, shit!
- Oh, man, Kirby.

92
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,069
Made me miss my shot.

93
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,076
You know these motherfuckers down South.

94
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,576
I wonder if half the time
they believe what they be sayin'.

95
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,621
What's a nigger gonna do?

96
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,674
We got blood in this land
from slaves.

97
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:17,850
Been to war. Spilt our blood.
Shit, I been to war. I spilt blood.

98
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:20,018
Ha! That's right.
Tell 'em, Kirby.

99
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,308
You over there fightin' in Korea.

100
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:25,987
That's how I got this plastic-ass leg.
Nicky, fix me a drink.

101
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,615
Ko-motherfuckin'-rea.

102
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,797
Damn! Mmm!

103
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,050
Never gonna give you up

104
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,512
That's why I had to leave that
motherfucker, because if I'd have...

105
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:43,225
If I'd have still been down there,
I'd have killed me a motherfucker.

106
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:47,232
Man, shit ain't gonna change.
What make you think shit gonna change?

107
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:49,903
Nigger, what's your little
narrow ass doin' up in here, man?

108
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:54,869
Leave that boy alone
and let him shoot.

109
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,341
Aw, Kirby, man, you know he too
goddam young to be up in here, man.

110
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:02,043
He can outshoot you.

111
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,181
Oh, shit.

112
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,933
Oh, I know you out
your motherfuckin' mind, man.

113
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,562
Put your money
where your mouth is.

114
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,081
I take your money.
Rack 'em, boy.

115
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:25,966
- Uh, huh, huh, huh
- Watch this.

116
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,806
I got the feelin'

117
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:31,180
Baby, baby, I got the feelin'

118
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:35,068
- Yes!
- You don't know

119
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:37,489
You got my two dollars?

120
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:39,905
Game ain't over yet, man.

121
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,331
Got the eight ball,
corner pocket.

122
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:46,586
Oh, man!

123
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,184
Don't run out of here without payin' me
after that boy whup you.

124
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,522
Yeah, at least I will
run out of this, motherfucker.

125
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,186
People that owe me money don't pay me,
I take care of 'em.

126
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:06,084
Man, will you get the fuck off
my motherfuckin' table, please?

127
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:12,179
- Baby-baby-baby, baby-baby-baby
- Chicken-haired motherfucker.

128
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,387
Ain't no goddam business
bein' here in the first place.

129
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:23,740
Ooh, missed it by that much.

130
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,914
- Cleanup time.
- You don't never play with me.

131
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,502
Eight ball, corner pocket.

132
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:39,347
Oh! Yes! Game.

133
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:45,194
Hey, that's a good game, Cowboy.

134
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:47,448
You're a lucky motherfucker,
you know that?

135
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:52,537
Aw, I wouldn't say luck,
but, you know.

136
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,459
- Just know how to play a little bit.
- Here's the money.

137
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:59,545
- Give that to Kirby.
- All right.

138
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:02,556
Uh, wait, wait.
This is two dollars.

139
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:07,152
See, uh, you bet me, so that means,
uh, you owe me some money too.

140
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:12,326
Man, fuck you.

141
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,865
Why you gotta cheat?

142
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,958
Man, who the fuck you think
you talkin' to, man?

143
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:20,340
You know what? I'm gonna tell
everybody around here...

144
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,092
when it comes to playin' pool,
Cowboy likes to cheat.

145
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,518
Nigger, I'll kick
your little monkey ass, man.

146
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,642
Oh, man.

147
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,275
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth, man.

148
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,361
I oughta cut you.

149
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:38,668
Little motherfucker. Yeah.

150
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:42,374
It hurt, don't it?

151
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:45,305
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doin'?

152
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,731
Get the fuck off of me, man!
Kirby, what the fuck you doin', man?

153
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:53,060
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- What the fuck are you doin', man?

154
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:57,201
- Get on out of here!
- You a bad motherfucker!

155
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:59,576
- And don't you come back in here
unless you come correct.
- Fuck you!

156
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,476
- You all right, kid?
- Oh, yeah.

157
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:13,094
Just a little cut, you know.
It's all right.

158
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:19,365
Yep. You do a real good job
for me with them numbers.

159
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,700
Well, you know, I try.

160
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:26,626
But, uh, you better be cool.
Don't let your mom and pop find out.

161
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,791
Oh, no way.
I won't do that.

162
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:37,062
It's for you.

163
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:42,824
Oh, man. Whoa!

164
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:45,532
- Hey, thanks, Kirby.
- Ain't nothin' to thank me for.

165
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:49,996
- You earned it.
- Oh. Twenties.

166
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,917
Hey, kid, you wanna take
a little run with me?

167
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:59,688
Yeah, I'll take
a little run with you.

168
00:15:04,197 --> 00:15:06,691
Say, uh, Kirby, where we goin'?

169
00:15:06,785 --> 00:15:09,325
Like I told you,
just a little run.

170
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:12,703
A run. Okay. All right.

171
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:17,968
- Wanna drive, kid?
- Who, me?

172
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,673
No, not "me."
You, motherfucker.

173
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,680
Well, Kirby,
I don't have my licence yet.

174
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:25,526
Aw, shit. Fuck the dumb shit.
You wanna drive or what?

175
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,186
Yeah. All right, I'll drive.
Yeah.

176
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:34,914
- Pull over here.
- All right.

177
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:37,412
Come on. Come on.

178
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:40,255
What you call her, Nellie?
Come on, Nellie.

179
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:42,885
I call this bitch
whatever I wanna call her.

180
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:59,170
Listen here.
Keep that motor runnin'.

181
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:01,539
- I'll just be a minute here.
- Yeah, all right.

182
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:30,677
- Stop messin' with my gold!
- Wait a minute!
- How many times I gotta tell you?

183
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:39,654
I ain't no motherfuckin'
play toy! I'll kick your ass!

184
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:43,791
- Get the fuck up!
- You get the fuck up off of Spyder!

185
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,790
No.

186
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,047
You got more heart than
your punk-ass old man. Come here.

187
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:54,804
- Oh, man, Kirby!
- Oh, what the...

188
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:57,477
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid son-of-a-bitch!

189
00:16:57,609 --> 00:17:00,148
You grabbed the wrong leg,
you stupid cocksucker. Come here!

190
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,069
- Get on back in here now, Spyder.
- You asshole!

191
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,653
- I want my motherfuckin' money, hear?
- Easy, Kirby.

192
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,748
- Now!
- Easy, man!
- Dumb son-of-a...

193
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:10,251
Give me my fuckin' leg,
you stupid cocksucker.

194
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:13,753
- I'll fuck you up.
- Get on back down there.

195
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:18,102
- They gonna call the police.
- I got 15 miles to go now

196
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:22,181
- Come on. Come on!
- And I can hear my baby callin' my name

197
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,442
Floor this motherfucker.

198
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,451
Floor it.

199
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,828
Now I'll be so glad
to see my baby

200
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:37,586
And hold her in my arms
one more time

201
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,805
Now when I kiss her lips

202
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,056
- I'll turn a backward flip
- You did good, kid.

203
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:45,481
You're almost as good
a getaway driver as me.

204
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:49,112
Uh, thanks. Say, uh...

205
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,658
So you were a getaway driver, huh?

206
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:59,500
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What? Wh-What's wrong?

207
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,087
- I oughta go back there
and kill that bastard.
- Why? What happened?

208
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:04,514
Motherfucker made me lose
a whole pack of cigarettes.

209
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:08,017
A pack of cigarettes?
A pack of cigarettes?

210
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:11,439
I thought maybe you should be
worried about your leg or somethin'.

211
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:15,491
- Oh, that shit's funny to you, huh?
- No, no, it's not funny.

212
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,491
I tell you what. The next time
the motherfucker grabs me by...

213
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:20,956
the wrong leg, I'm gonna use it to kick
his ass between his shoulder blades.

214
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,384
- Hey, man, you really did that sucker.
- Yeah, everybody in town...

215
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,801
know I got one leg, and that
motherfucker grab the wrong one.

216
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:31,023
Me and Kirby, baby. Yeah.

217
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,157
- This is wonderful news, Edward.
- Thank you.

218
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:45,164
All right, all right.
You see, Anthony?

219
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:48,672
You be thankful you can go to City
College on the financial aid programme.

220
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:53,808
Yeah, in four years,
you can be just like me.

221
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,979
Just like you?

222
00:18:58,116 --> 00:19:01,866
You can graduate and maybe even
go to graduate school too.

223
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:06,378
Well, I'll tell y'all one thing.
My mama sure would've been proud.

224
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:09,960
Never would've believed
I got two college graduates.

225
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,725
You think about what
you're gonna major in, baby?

226
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:20,312
The Marine Corps.
Uh, Dad, could you pass the salt?

227
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:23,077
What'd you say?

228
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:29,120
Thanks. I said
the, uh, Marine Corps.

229
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:31,171
- I'm... I'm joinin'.
- Marine Corps?

230
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:35,211
- Yeah.
- Now that's original.

231
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,265
What you talkin' about, Anthony?

232
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:40,516
I'm talkin' about
I wanna do somethin' else.

233
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:44,026
I don't wanna go to college.

234
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:46,987
I'm sick of school.

235
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,034
I mean, I don't know why everybody
got this strange look on their face.

236
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:55,630
- It's my life.
- Yeah.

237
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,635
It's your life.

238
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:02,264
Looks like to me
you're tryin' to ruin it, baby.

239
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,615
You're an idiot.
You know that?

240
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:18,292
Dad, I don't wanna go to college.
I'm just not ready for no college.

241
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:24,679
You always said the marines and fightin'
over in Korea made a man out of you.

242
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:30,028
I figure I be, you know,
livin' my own life.

243
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:34,658
I'll talk to your mama.

244
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:50,896
When your baby and you are tight
and everything is right

245
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:53,103
- And you is mellow
- Give me that.

246
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:55,647
There you go.
Now, drink some wine.

247
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:57,736
You keep everything all right

248
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:00,625
And you know that
you're the only fellow

249
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,964
Ain't that a groove

250
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,888
Ain't that a groove

251
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,811
Ain't that a groove

252
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,899
Told your little ass
you couldn't drink with me.

253
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:17,561
- Ain't that a groove
- Hey, James. Want some of this?

254
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:19,906
- Now, lookee here, fella
- Yeah! Whoo!

255
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:23,662
Girls like to be in the mood
whenever they think their man is yellow

256
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:26,915
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Hit me, baby

257
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:32,011
Say, Skeeter, I still can't
believe you graduated, man.

258
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:35,228
- Man, shut up.
- Glad we out of school, man.

259
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:37,806
I'm sick of these
stupid-ass brothers.

260
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,937
I'm about to get
my pimp thing on started.

261
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:42,611
You know, I got so many ho's now, man,
I gotta get an assistant pimp...

262
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:45,746
just to keep in track of 'em,
you know, make sure they on
the right streets and shit.

263
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:49,749
Say, Skippy, why... why you always
talkin' about this pimp stuff, man?
What's happenin'?

264
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,676
'Cause it's real, man. I'm a pimp.
Pimpin' run in my family.

265
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:55,426
My great-great granddaddy was a slave,
and he was a pimp.

266
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:59,268
He used to have his ho's
pick his cotton in the field.
He didn't have to do shit.

267
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:01,814
You better be careful, man. You're
gonna catch something, Skip. Watch.

268
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:04,948
That's all right, motherfucker.
I was born by the pussy,
I'll die by the pussy.

269
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,944
Don't worry about
what the fuck I do.

270
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,948
Hey, Skip, do you
believe in superstition?

271
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,829
Hell, no.

272
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,669
Well, you should, man.
Your stupid ass jinxed me.

273
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:20,472
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- Uncle Sam, man.

274
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,683
Dropped a motherfuckin' 1-A on me.

275
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,686
I told you, didn't I?
Didn't I tell you?

276
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,188
- Say, when did that happen?
- Last week, Anthony, man.

277
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:31,114
Yeah, right, motherfucker.
Pass the joint.

278
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:35,667
- Anthony, man.
- What?

279
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:39,209
You know that, um,
that me and Marisol, we tight, man.

280
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:41,511
Yeah, man, y'all are...
Y'all pretty down.

281
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:43,807
- You would say I love her?
- I don't know.

282
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:45,895
I could say that you love her.

283
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,604
- I'm thinkin' about marrying her, man.
- Oh, wait a minute.

284
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:52,867
- Hey, don't do that shit.
- Hey, man, you might be goin'
a little too fast now.

285
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:57,582
Hey, I love her, man, and did you see
how she looks today at that party, man?

286
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:00,916
- She looks good enough to marry.
- I'm glad to hear you want me.

287
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:06,264
What you over here
talkin' about, Anthony?

288
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:09,480
- Why you standin' over here?
- Shut up, Skippy.
- Shut up.

289
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:16,281
Anthony, I know you ain't gonna
stay over here talkin' to Skip
while my song's playin'.

290
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:19,075
Not if they expect to be
with us tonight.

291
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:23,121
- Look here, Skippy, we gonna
have to cut on out, bro.
- Uh, yeah.

292
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:25,547
- Man, where y'all goin'?
- Uh, we gonna go hang on out.

293
00:23:25,677 --> 00:23:27,719
- Look it, have some chicken.
- I thought we was hangin', man.
- Have some chicken, man.

294
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:31,183
I told you about them broads,
old punk-ass.

295
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:33,888
And anyway, Skip,
Brenda lookin' for you.

296
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:37,647
I don't give a fuck.
You tell her I'm at where I at
and I'll be where I be.

297
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:42,038
Motherfuckin' pimp.
If I gotta go where every ho
want me to be, I be confused.

298
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:44,290
Motherfucker. Tell her
don't make me hurt my hand again.

299
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:51,215
If you want a do-right all day

300
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,223
Woman

301
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:59,821
You gotta be a do-right

302
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,698
All night

303
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:04,745
Jose, I love you.

304
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:09,832
I love you too, mama.

305
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:12,594
If you give my pussy away
to somebody else...

306
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,678
while I'm gone...

307
00:24:14,765 --> 00:24:18,267
I'm gonna come back
and blow that motherfucker up.

308
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:22,728
I got this itch
I need to be scratched.

309
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:33,372
S-S-S-So... So you're sayin'
that y-your, your mama...

310
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:35,375
is workin' a night shift tonight?

311
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:38,923
Mm-hmm.
And you know what else?

312
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:41,896
You could scratch it
all night long if you want to.

313
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:49,072
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.

314
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:51,652
You swear Big Bertha
won't get off work early?

315
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:54,876
She's not gonna get off
from work early.

316
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:57,163
- You scared?
- No, I ain't scared. I just don't...

317
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,875
You act like you're scared.
Come on. Shut up.

318
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,222
- Where Delilah at?
- She in her room. Come on!

319
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,483
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

320
00:25:11,616 --> 00:25:13,575
- Get out.
- Say it loud

321
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:16,493
- I'm black and I'm proud
- Go to your own room.

322
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:20,585
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

323
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:29,439
Once upon a time
I almost lost my mind

324
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:31,191
I was lonely

325
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:37,450
So lonely

326
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,417
Once upon a time

327
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,710
Oh, Juanita.

328
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:47,175
Look, it's okay.

329
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:50,303
It's all right.
It's okay.

330
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:53,225
- Okay. Okay.
- Let me get your bra.

331
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:55,227
- Okay.
- Let me get it.

332
00:25:58,032 --> 00:26:01,654
- Ow. Just unhook it. Just unhook the...
- I can't. I can't.

333
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:04,876
I'll get it.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

334
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:07,205
- Okay. Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

335
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:11,003
Don't peek. Don't look at...
Don't look at me. Okay.

336
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,715
Okay. Okay.

337
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:17,773
- Oh!
- What?

338
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:22,318
That's not it.
Up, up, up, up. Higher. Ow.

339
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:24,992
- That's too high. Wait. Down, down.
- Okay, wait.

340
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:28,126
- Right there? Okay.
- Yeah.

341
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,625
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

342
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,843
- It's okay.
- Uh-oh. Wait.

343
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:40,391
Okay. Easy. Ow!

344
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:42,400
Ah!

345
00:27:08,743 --> 00:27:12,613
Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait.

346
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,453
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

347
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:19,214
- Okay.
- Baby.

348
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:22,639
You know, Marisol and Jose
goin' down to city hall tomorrow.

349
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:25,308
Oh, yeah? What for?

350
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:27,314
To get married.

351
00:27:29,154 --> 00:27:31,908
- Is that right?
- What you think about that?

352
00:27:34,413 --> 00:27:36,288
Nothin', I guess.

353
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:40,957
So I guess you don't want me
to wait for you either.

354
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,012
Look, Juanita,
I didn't say that.

355
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,847
So then you're gonna marry me
when you get back?

356
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:52,314
I mean, if you
ain't got somebody else.

357
00:27:54,449 --> 00:27:57,073
I don't want nobody else.

358
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,414
Juanita, have you
ever thought maybe...

359
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:07,926
maybe I might get hurt out there
and never come back?

360
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:11,387
You know, I don't want
you waitin' for nothin'.

361
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,437
You're not scared of losing me?

362
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:21,036
I didn't say that either.

363
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:23,039
I'm scared of losing you.

364
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:36,222
So, do you think we could probably
do it one more time before I go?

365
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:38,233
Uh-huh.

366
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,510
Oh, no.

367
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:02,232
- It's Ma!
- Shh! But it's just 6:30!

368
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:06,066
- She just pulled up.
- Well, go stall her. And close my door!

369
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,202
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Oh, man.

370
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,079
I shouldn't have never messed around
with you in the first place.

371
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:13,252
- Right.
- You know Bertha gonna kill us.
- Wait a minute.

372
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:15,377
- Uh-uh. Ain't gonna wait no minute.
Would you move?
- Wait a minute!

373
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:19,766
Come on. Let me help you
with them packages.

374
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:22,770
- Delilah!
- I got it.

375
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,273
Girl, you got my good groceries
all on the ground.

376
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:28,449
Pick those up.

377
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:31,454
Since I work, the least you girls
could do is keep this place clean.

378
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,638
You know I'm gonna
wait for you, Anthony.

379
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,301
Juanita, I gotta go.

380
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,703
I gotta go, Juanita.

381
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:23,914
- Nigger, get out of my yard!
- Fuck you!

382
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,766
Shut up!

383
00:30:31,104 --> 00:30:33,015
What's your status? Over.

384
00:30:44,962 --> 00:30:47,420
Shit.

385
00:30:47,508 --> 00:30:50,429
Head for the rally point!
Get back to the rally point!

386
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,721
Get the fuck outta here!

387
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:02,112
Let's go! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Come on! Come on!

388
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:05,579
Come on! Move!
Move! Let's go!

389
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,420
Load 'em up! Load 'em up!

390
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:14,800
Oh, fuck!
I'm out of ammo!

391
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:17,639
- Devaughn! Cover me!
- Stay down!

392
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,648
I got him! Hurry up!

393
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,905
Don't check out on us, Martin.
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

394
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,957
- I got him!
- Cover fire!

395
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:34,667
Goddam it! They got us pinned down!
We'll never make the rally point!

396
00:31:36,805 --> 00:31:39,179
Dugan!

397
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:42,936
You think it's time we get these
fucking dinks off our asses? Huh?

398
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,942
- Relax.
- Fuck you!

399
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,406
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

400
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:51,822
Radio, up!

401
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:54,539
God don't like dinks.

402
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:58,844
- How's he doin', Curtis?
- Thanks. Thanks for not leavin' me, man.

403
00:31:58,928 --> 00:32:02,180
- Where the fuck is that radio?
Get that radio up here!
- No, no, no, no, no.

404
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:04,939
Radio comin'! Radio comin'!

405
00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:08,401
Get that cover fire, Ferguson.
You wanna die, boy?

406
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,658
Sir, sir! Lieutenant!
Arty freak!

407
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:18,876
Hammerhead, Hammerhead. Recon Cobra.
Emergency fire mission. Over.

408
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:22,251
Hold on, brother. Come on.
Come on, come on.

409
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:24,423
You gonna make it, dude.
You only got a little longer.

410
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:27,311
- You gonna make it.
- Grid five, seven, one-niner.

411
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:31,105
- Tell my mama...
- No, no, I don't...

412
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:39,041
Gooks in the bush.
Request firecracker salvo. Will adjust.

413
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,042
How copy? Over.

414
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,126
Roger. Solid copy.
Firecracker shot out.

415
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:46,835
Incoming!

416
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:49,928
Down! Down! Down!

417
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:52,393
Curtis, get down!
Curtis, get down!

418
00:33:34,098 --> 00:33:36,888
Out-fucking-standing job.

419
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,189
Saddle up. Let's get to the rally point,
take that whirlybird home.

420
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:43,979
- We got some beer to drink.
- We goin' to the rally point now?

421
00:33:47,748 --> 00:33:51,001
The mission's been compromised.
We're goin' to site 37.

422
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,089
It ain't compromised no more.

423
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,215
They're dead.
Now this is Sneaky Pete.

424
00:33:57,307 --> 00:34:00,808
Reconnaissance.
Some of them dead gooks...

425
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,941
they could have important
intelligence papers on their bodies.

426
00:34:07,658 --> 00:34:09,985
All right.

427
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:12,411
- Move 'em out.
- Move out!

428
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:18,257
Hammerhead, Hammerhead.
Cobra on site of your mission now.

429
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:23,057
I count ten... say again, ten...
November-Victor-Alpha-Kilo-lndia-Alpha.

430
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:27,768
- How copy? Over.
- I copy, one-zero. Good job.

431
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:30,817
Hammerhead, Cobra. Solid copy.
Good job. Cobra out.

432
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:38,833
Aw, shit, man! What you doin'?
He already dead.

433
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:52,524
Motherfucker.

434
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:54,773
Looks like we nailed us
an officer.

435
00:34:56,203 --> 00:35:01,415
You lucky bastard. You get back to C.P.,
you name your own price, sir.

436
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:05,678
No way, D'Ambrosio.
I'm keepin' this one.

437
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:08,255
Been lookin' for one of these
since Cleon and I got here in '66.

438
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:11,145
Ain't that right, Cleon?

439
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:15,646
I walked right by that guy.

440
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,355
You gotta keep your eyes open.

441
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:31,965
Oh, man, what the fuck?

442
00:35:53,473 --> 00:35:55,431
You hungry or somethin', Cleon?

443
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,984
Just like you, sir.

444
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:02,946
I'm collectin' me a souvenir.

445
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,166
Saddle up. We're movin' out.

446
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:15,923
That's all he's gonna say? You ain't got
nothin' to tell this fuckin' shit, man?

447
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:38,425
- Man, that nigger Cleon crazy.
- Yeah.

448
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:40,428
- Did you see that shit?
- I saw it.

449
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:42,598
- Nigger, did you see that shit?
- Yes.

450
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:45,184
I heard that nigger's supposed
to be a preacher's son and shit.

451
00:36:45,273 --> 00:36:48,193
He cuttin' off motherfucker's
heads for souvenirs and shit.

452
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:51,282
Now, if you hadn't flunked out
of Hunter College, pimp daddy Skippy...

453
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,534
you would've missed all this
good shit down in Vietnam.

454
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:57,752
Kiss my ass, nigger. You the reason
why I'm at this motherfucker anyway.

455
00:36:57,838 --> 00:36:59,748
You didn't tell me 'bout
this recon shit.

456
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,168
- That's 'cause you didn't ask me
when you were writin' me.
- Nigger, I didn't have to.

457
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:05,176
- Shit, I figured it was
better than being a grunt.
- It is.

458
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,432
Ant, motherfucker,
we out in the woods all day.

459
00:37:08,565 --> 00:37:10,892
Them motherfuckin' gooks jumpin' out
like Indians every five minutes.

460
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:13,775
- Man, a nigger
ain't made for this shit.
- You thought this was a skate.

461
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:16,116
Nigger, ain't nothin'
wrong with no skate.

462
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:18,869
You could just call me
a skatin' motherfucker.

463
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,789
I skate my ass right out of here,
they give me a chance to.

464
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:27,552
- Ain't no shitbirds on my squad.
- Man, what you jivin' about?

465
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,918
Hey. Hey.

466
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:49,835
Ant. To the Bronx.

467
00:37:49,972 --> 00:37:51,847
Yeah, uh...

468
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:55,264
to the youngblood
who couldn't be with us today.

469
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:58,355
- Lance Corporal Martin.
- To Lance Corporal Martin.

470
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:10,121
- Yes.
- Yo, Ant, man.

471
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:12,217
What they be puttin'
in your head out here, man?

472
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:15,722
I mean, you done got into this shit
a little bit too deep, don't you think?

473
00:38:15,852 --> 00:38:19,389
You're in recon now, Skip.
You in deep too.

474
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:23,528
Man, fuck this shit, man.

475
00:38:23,616 --> 00:38:25,824
- Oh, come on, man.
- Man, this ain't our war, man.

476
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:29,159
Shit, our black ass should be
back in the Bronx where we belong.

477
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:33,210
Joe-ass got lucky. They sent him
home, gettin' wounded and shit.

478
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,971
Heard he wounded his hand
pretty bad, man.

479
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:39,016
Shit, that's all right, though.
He got out of this shit.

480
00:38:39,144 --> 00:38:42,349
I rather be home with a fucked-up hand
up in some pussy than to be out here...

481
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:44,442
healthier than
a motherfucker without it.

482
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:47,615
- Shit.
- Same old Skip. Boy, you ain't changed.

483
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,617
That's right.

484
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:52,703
You heard from Juanita?

485
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:54,960
She used to write me a lot
during my first tour.

486
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:57,332
We got a package for ya!

487
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:02,180
Turns out, man, before I left,
fucked around and got her pregnant.

488
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:06,063
- Man, you bullshittin'.
- No, I ain't.

489
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:09,314
- No shit?
- Dead serious, man.
Got a little girl back at home.

490
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:13,703
Oh, man, that's groovy, man. That's
groovy. I can dig it. That's cool.

491
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,741
Hey, dig, man, I know
you got a picture, man.

492
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:19,414
- Let me see her picture. Shit.
- Can't even look at her, man.

493
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:21,627
Man, what the fuck
you mean, bro?

494
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,880
That's your little girl, man.
That's your baby.

495
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:26,473
You know how I survived
26 months in the bush?

496
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:30,943
Because I don't think about the world,
Skip. That shit don't exist to me.

497
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,278
I don't give a fuck about anything
or anyone in it...

498
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:38,203
because the minute I do, I'm a dead man
out here, and you remember that shit.

499
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:41,870
We'll talk about the world
when we get back.

500
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,463
Yeah, whatever, man.

501
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:46,718
I'm gonna go get high.

502
00:39:46,848 --> 00:39:50,551
I mean real high. And I'm gonna
get my dick sucked too.

503
00:39:57,284 --> 00:39:59,076
Big dick. Big.

504
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:01,412
Very, very big.
Can you handle it?

505
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:08,757
"Hey there, Kirby.
What's happenin' back in the world?

506
00:40:08,845 --> 00:40:10,886
If you hadn't heard,
doin' my second tour."

507
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,977
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

508
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,940
"We spend most of our time
livin' in the bush.

509
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:25,622
Kind of numb to
everything out here.

510
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:28,119
Tryin' to keep
my head clear.

511
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:31,467
Our lieutenant is this crazy
white boy named Dugan from Ohio.

512
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,853
He's good at gettin' us
out of crazy situations.

513
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:45,196
We got this one wild-ass
brother out here named Cleon."

514
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:47,322
Gook fuck.

515
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:51,000
"His daddy's this big-time preacher, but
you'd never know from his crazy son."

516
00:40:51,087 --> 00:40:55,884
Now you're good.
Now Jesus loves you.

517
00:40:56,013 --> 00:40:59,350
"He's from Mount Vernon.
Oh, yeah. You won't believe it...

518
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:02,108
but Skip volunteered
for my unit.

519
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:04,108
I don't think he's
cut out for recon.

520
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:09,697
He's always gettin' high and shit,
tryin' to keep his mind off things.

521
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:13,783
Me, I'm just tryin' to take it one day
at a time and do what's right...

522
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,672
whatever that is.

523
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:20,300
See you when I get
back to the Bronx.

524
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:22,307
Anthony."

525
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,185
That fuckin' shit stinks.

526
00:42:39,198 --> 00:42:43,994
I don't wanna pull rank, Cleon, but if
you don't get rid of that fuckin' head...

527
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:46,206
I don't hear nobody else
complainin' but you.

528
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:50,046
Well, maybe you should
listen to your team.

529
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:53,048
Medical advice, Cleon:
You dump that shit.

530
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:56,220
Hey, Doc, shut the fuck up.
You don't know shit.

531
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:59,980
Fuck you, man. It stinks like
a sack full of assholes.

532
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,983
Ain't a one of us got as much
as a splinter in his finger...

533
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:05,110
since I cut this head off.

534
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:07,737
This head is our
good-luck charm.

535
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:13,293
Nah, this here's
our good-luck charm.

536
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:16,595
If you don't mind, Sergeant, l...
My vote is to get rid of it.

537
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:19,353
Man, Cleon, you need to get the fuck on
with that bullshit, man.

538
00:43:19,478 --> 00:43:23,230
- That head smell like shit.
- Bottom line, Staff Sergeant.

539
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:28,451
You either get rid of that fuckin' head
A.S.A. fuckin' P., or I'm gonna...

540
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:32,828
have your ass court-martialed
when we get back to the rear.

541
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:35,500
We clear?

542
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:49,488
Cobra, Cobra, Delta six. Over.

543
00:43:49,615 --> 00:43:52,239
Delta six, Delta six, Cobra.
Copy. Over.

544
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:54,495
Cobra, Delta six.
Execute Charlie, Michael...

545
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:59,747
We're in a world of shit now.
I just buried our luck.

546
00:43:59,883 --> 00:44:03,635
Listen up. Change of mission.
A patrol from 25 has found...

547
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,226
a shitload of weapons in a vill
about a klik and a half to our whisky.

548
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:09,231
Platoon commander wants us
to interrogate on the spot.

549
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,232
Betancourt, you're the closest one in
the area that speaks that gook shit.

550
00:44:12,365 --> 00:44:16,697
So that's where we're headin'.
All right, saddle up. We're movin' out.

551
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:21,585
- So now where's D'Ambrosio?
- He went to go take a shit.

552
00:44:21,714 --> 00:44:24,422
- When?
- When Cleon was diggin' the hole.

553
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:26,428
- Why the hell didn't you go with him?
- You know how he is.

554
00:44:26,557 --> 00:44:29,809
- He don't like nobody around
when he's shittin'.
- Oh, man.

555
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:32,228
Grab his shit.
Let's find him.

556
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:42,958
Aww.

557
00:44:43,086 --> 00:44:45,959
Fuck! Doc.

558
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:49,130
- 360!
- D'Ambrosio, what'd they do?

559
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:53,312
You'll be all right.
Doc's gonna take care of you, okay?

560
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,404
This morphine is all
I can do for him right now.

561
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:12,004
Here, Doc. You can use mine
if that's not enough.

562
00:45:12,138 --> 00:45:15,177
Are you crazy? Another one of those
would kill him right now.

563
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:28,494
What the fuck
you got there, Curtis?

564
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:32,536
Somethin' about
"Black men, go home.

565
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:35,672
This isn't your war."

566
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:39,177
You get rid of that cocksucking
commie bullshit right now.

567
00:45:42,692 --> 00:45:44,901
- Yeah. Right.
- Hey, Curtis.

568
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,903
- Apply some pressure here.
- We gotta hump this man
back to the rally point.

569
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:49,911
Oh, shit.

570
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:54,878
Save me, Curtis.

571
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:57,084
Look, Adam, you don't
worry 'bout nothin'.

572
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,379
We're a team,
okay, brother?

573
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:02,392
- We gonna take care of you.
- Please.

574
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:05,565
Yeah. It's not much longer.
We're almost there.

575
00:46:06,861 --> 00:46:08,736
Kill me.

576
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,994
Kill me!

577
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:17,160
I would do it
for you.

578
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:19,587
I would do it
for you, Curtis.

579
00:46:19,675 --> 00:46:22,133
Buttermilk 17.
Cobra, over.

580
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:27,013
Cobra, Cobra. Buttermilk 17. Inbound
your buzz. Contact on your visual.

581
00:46:27,147 --> 00:46:29,023
- Shh.
- Buttermilk 17. Cobra.

582
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:31,359
Hey, you gonna be all right.

583
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:34,824
The medevac will be here
in a minute.

584
00:46:34,952 --> 00:46:37,078
Do it.

585
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,047
You think
I don't mean it?

586
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,266
I can't go home like this.

587
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:51,640
- Hey, what's he saying?
- He's delirious, man.

588
00:46:58,036 --> 00:46:59,994
- Please.
- Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk.

589
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:03,951
- Hooking direct to your 12. Stand by.
- Cobra standing by. Over.

590
00:47:49,753 --> 00:47:52,590
Shh-shh-shh.

591
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,344
Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk 17.
Roger your visual. Pop smoke. Over.

592
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:02,807
Buttermilk 17, Cobra.
Smoke. Over.

593
00:48:02,943 --> 00:48:06,149
Pop the smoke.
Get that man ready for medevac!

594
00:48:17,678 --> 00:48:20,966
- When'd he go?
- A few minutes ago.

595
00:48:22,478 --> 00:48:25,565
It's better to check out
than go home all fucked up.

596
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,905
No shit.

597
00:49:32,479 --> 00:49:35,268
Oh, shit!
Get down!

598
00:49:36,486 --> 00:49:39,157
Fuckin' assholes!

599
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:42,488
- Stay down! Stay down!
- I'm gonna get these motherfuckers!

600
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:45,993
Return fire! Fire!

601
00:49:46,128 --> 00:49:48,835
Get these motherfuckers!

602
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:55,303
- Skip! Return some fire!
- Shoot them motherfuckers!

603
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:59,982
Mission aborted! We get the fuck
out of Dodge, back to the rally point!

604
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:03,322
Ferguson! Get some
fuckin' rounds goin'!

605
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:07,867
Skip! Cover me!

606
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,244
- Dugan!
- Dugan, wait!

607
00:50:12,174 --> 00:50:16,175
Dugan!
Dugan!

608
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:30,038
Skip! Skip!
Snap out of that shit. Go!

609
00:50:30,123 --> 00:50:33,791
- Fuck this, man.
Let's bug out, Cleon!
- Cobra, move the fuck out!

610
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:36,081
- Get up! Come on!
- Move it! Move it!

611
00:50:36,217 --> 00:50:38,627
Move! Get up!
Get up! Come on!

612
00:50:49,282 --> 00:50:51,158
- What are you doin'?
- What is this, man?

613
00:50:51,286 --> 00:50:54,408
- Slow down, man.
- Fuckin' grunts!

614
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:57,587
- Say, get a special shot for Skip.
My man's goin' home today.
- Count of three: 1-2-3.

615
00:50:57,714 --> 00:51:00,088
All right. Good.
Now come on, now. Skip, come on, now.

616
00:51:00,176 --> 00:51:02,587
Let's see a dap, man.

617
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:12,529
- All right!
- Get one like this. Get one like this.

618
00:51:12,658 --> 00:51:14,652
Come on, now.
Everybody, come on. Get closer.

619
00:51:14,787 --> 00:51:17,196
- Ah, man!
- This is Cobra, baby.

620
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:21,962
- Recon Cobra!
- It's Cobra. Hey, hey!

621
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:24,339
Team Cobra, ready?

622
00:51:44,547 --> 00:51:46,423
Come on

623
00:51:50,558 --> 00:51:53,681
Come along, come on
and get up and get down too

624
00:51:56,402 --> 00:51:59,655
- Get down, get up
- Say, h-h-hold on a sec.

625
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:03,743
- Keep the metre running.
- Get down, get up and move your feet

626
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:07,792
Come on and rise, rise, rise
Shake your get-up

627
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:10,250
Straighten up there, marine!

628
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:15,766
He a friend of yours?

629
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:18,305
Friend of yours and
I'll give a discount, marine.

630
00:52:18,442 --> 00:52:20,899
No, man.

631
00:52:23,284 --> 00:52:26,240
Oh, shit.

632
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:28,740
Man, look who's back
in the motherfuckin' world.

633
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:32,254
Dig this motherfucker
right here, man.

634
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,221
Look at you, man. That's a mackin'
outfit if I've ever seen one.

635
00:52:35,306 --> 00:52:38,926
- Look, with all the stripes and shit.
What, you a captain now?
- No, man.

636
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,021
Look, man, you wear that motherfucker
for about a month, this nigger
get all the pussy, man.

637
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:46,280
Check this motherfucker out, man.

638
00:52:46,408 --> 00:52:50,030
Well, look, man... Yeah,
you go get me some squares, man.

639
00:52:50,123 --> 00:52:53,792
I gotta take care of a couple things,
baby. I'll get back with you. All right?

640
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:56,415
You stay up now, all right?

641
00:52:58,805 --> 00:53:00,965
What's happening, blood?

642
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:02,976
Hey, man, I'm back.

643
00:53:06,694 --> 00:53:08,605
My nigger!

644
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:13,289
Come on and get down

645
00:53:13,415 --> 00:53:15,540
Hey, Luther!

646
00:53:15,669 --> 00:53:17,462
Tell your sister I'm gonna
be over there later on.

647
00:53:17,548 --> 00:53:19,922
Hey, fuck you!

648
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:25,557
Man, the neighbourhood is changin'.

649
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:29,023
Aw, it's still a good place.
White people movin' out, though.

650
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:33,945
Oh, dig. I saw Juanita
the other day, man.

651
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:37,038
Man, she finer than a motherfucker.

652
00:53:37,165 --> 00:53:39,955
Is that right?

653
00:53:40,046 --> 00:53:43,418
You need to go check her out, man.
Go see your little daughter.

654
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,306
Remember them big-ass ears
you had when you was young?

655
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:49,478
She got 'em, just like you.
That's how I know it was yours.

656
00:53:51,107 --> 00:53:54,111
So, what's up with Joe, man?
Is he, uh... Is he workin' or what?

657
00:53:54,238 --> 00:53:58,109
Aw, post office, you know.
Three-quarter gig, part-time.

658
00:53:58,245 --> 00:54:01,082
He gotta do what he gotta do.
He got mouths to feed, you know.

659
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:03,619
What about you, man?
How you doin'?

660
00:54:03,755 --> 00:54:05,584
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

661
00:54:05,717 --> 00:54:08,257
I'm cool, baby. I'm Skippy, baby.
I'm still pimpin'.

662
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:13,726
Need any money
or anything, you know?

663
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:16,390
Man, I got over like a fat rat
when I got out, man.

664
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:20,072
Dig, I got my school money comin'
from the government once a month.

665
00:54:20,201 --> 00:54:22,824
I got my veteran's cheque
comin' once a month.

666
00:54:22,956 --> 00:54:27,538
I got my fifty percent medical cheque
comin' to me for the rest of my life.

667
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:31,085
I ain't gotta do a goddam thing else
but go to the mailbox, you dig?

668
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:33,893
Hey, man, how the hell you pull
a fifty percent medical?

669
00:54:33,976 --> 00:54:36,017
Nigger, you ain't disabled.

670
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,022
Man, some shit got
into me over there, man.

671
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,277
What?

672
00:54:41,364 --> 00:54:44,818
All I know is my blood cells
are all fucked up.

673
00:54:44,954 --> 00:54:47,529
Some nights I wake up
in cold sweats and shit.

674
00:54:49,003 --> 00:54:51,412
Don't look at me like that, man.
It ain't the heroin.

675
00:54:51,507 --> 00:54:55,045
The heroin ain't never did nothin'
to me. A lot of vets
comin' down with this shit.

676
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,267
- And they don't know what it is?
- Square biz.

677
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:05,439
Damn. Look, man, you wanna
come on in the crib or somethin', man?

678
00:55:05,532 --> 00:55:07,907
Nah, man. I'm cool, baby.
Hey, I'm gonna split.

679
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:10,874
But you here, baby. You home.
We got plenty of time to do our thing.

680
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,793
You know what I'm sayin'?

681
00:55:17,804 --> 00:55:19,714
- Brother.
- Brother. Go see your mama.

682
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,687
- Right on. I'm gonna check her out.
- With her fine ass.

683
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:24,849
You know, I been takin' care
of your mama while you been gone.

684
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:26,853
Boy, I'll kick your head in.
Don't talk like that.

685
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:42,006
Mmm.

686
00:55:52,992 --> 00:55:54,867
You all right?

687
00:55:56,248 --> 00:55:57,791
Yeah.

688
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:03,885
Well, can't you look me in my eyes?
I ain't seen you in four years.

689
00:56:13,195 --> 00:56:15,189
Well, what'd you do over there?
What was it like?

690
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:19,870
Look, uh, I'd rather not
talk about that right now.

691
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:21,957
Well, Anthony, you gonna have
to tell us something.

692
00:56:22,085 --> 00:56:25,956
Now, you know a lot of them boys
went over there and got hooked
on them drugs and stuff. You know.

693
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:29,928
Look, I was in a special unit
out there...

694
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:32,510
and bad habits could've cost us
our lives.

695
00:56:32,647 --> 00:56:34,605
Well, that's what I'm talkin' about,
them bad habits, honey.

696
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:39,025
Now, if you picked up some of them
things, there's a lot of places
you can go and get help.

697
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:41,615
No bad habits, Ma.

698
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:44,279
'Cept a little killin'.

699
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:46,250
For my country, of course.

700
00:56:48,132 --> 00:56:50,043
Hey. Let me give you some more
of these collards.

701
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:51,839
- Yeah.
- Baby, this sure is good.

702
00:57:09,003 --> 00:57:12,790
Oh, shit. Look who back.
Look at this motherfuckin' man.

703
00:57:12,885 --> 00:57:15,758
- Hey, what's happenin', youngblood?
- What's goin' on, cool breeze?

704
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:19,808
- Long time, no see.
- All right now, Pops. What's happenin'?

705
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:24,313
Hey there. What's goin' on, blood?
Ain't seen you in a long time, man.

706
00:57:24,405 --> 00:57:26,780
- Boy just got back.
- Hey, blood.
- All right.

707
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:30,447
- Cheers. My man. Drink!
- All right. How you feel? All right.

708
00:57:32,503 --> 00:57:35,376
Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey, I got next game.

709
00:57:35,467 --> 00:57:38,042
- You know that's my table.
- You call that a break?

710
00:57:38,138 --> 00:57:41,475
- I got the thing made
- Hold up there, now. It's my shot.

711
00:57:41,603 --> 00:57:45,057
Say, chump.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

712
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:50,404
- Ha-ha!
- My man, Joe! What's happenin'?

713
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:53,912
- Oh, look at you!
- How you doin', man?

714
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,790
- Good, man. What's goin' on, man?
- Jesus Christ, man.

715
00:57:56,922 --> 00:57:59,082
- I can't believe it's you!
You cool, man!
- What's goin' on, man?

716
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:02,096
Say, man,
I heard you got wounded out there.

717
00:58:02,223 --> 00:58:06,639
Yeah, man. I was in demolitions
and my fuckin' hand gets blown off, man.

718
00:58:06,772 --> 00:58:10,820
- Oh, man. Shit.
- Yeah, man. But hey...

719
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:14,153
motherfuckers told me everything there
is to know about explosives, man!

720
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:17,788
- That right?
- Check you out, Pappy.
You got all those kids now.

721
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:20,963
Man, hey. You gotta check out Kirby,
man. He's over in the back room.

722
00:58:21,049 --> 00:58:23,173
Yeah. Let's go on back.
He's still back here, huh?

723
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:25,926
- All right. Dig it.
- Hey. Abre la puerta! Hey! Hey!

724
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:28,425
Doin' all right. You know, Kirby just
all hangin' in there, you know?

725
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,644
- Who the fuck is it?
- It's me.

726
00:58:30,732 --> 00:58:32,940
Blood! What's up, blood?

727
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:34,737
- Hey, Nicky. What's happenin', man?
- Skin!

728
00:58:34,864 --> 00:58:36,657
Kirby back there, man.

729
00:58:36,785 --> 00:58:38,494
That boy looked at me,
he say, "Kirby...

730
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:42,492
when she pulled off them drawers,
I thought I'd never stop seein' ass!"

731
00:58:46,302 --> 00:58:49,471
- What's happenin', Captain?
- Who the fuck is that?

732
00:58:52,271 --> 00:58:54,099
- Youngblood?
- Yeah, it's me!

733
00:58:54,233 --> 00:58:56,108
Youngblood! Come on, boy!

734
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:02,322
- How you doin'? Come on
in the back here, boy. Come on.
- Oh, boy. All right.

735
00:59:07,256 --> 00:59:11,886
Man, I been everywhere
lookin' for a gig.

736
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:15,434
Aw, motherfuckers forget about you
gettin' your ass almost blown off...

737
00:59:15,563 --> 00:59:17,058
or whatever the fuck.

738
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:20,942
Yeah. Look, uh, Kirby, uh...

739
00:59:21,072 --> 00:59:24,409
I was thinkin', man.
Maybe, uh, come back and work for you.

740
00:59:24,537 --> 00:59:27,375
What? Work for me?

741
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:31,412
Yeah. You know. Runnin' numbers.
Like we used to do.

742
00:59:31,508 --> 00:59:35,758
Shh. Fuckin' pigs run me
out of business.

743
00:59:35,891 --> 00:59:40,188
How... How the pigs run you
outta business, man?
You had 'em on the payroll.

744
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:42,309
Pigs are greedy.

745
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:44,604
And you gotta remember I'm dealing
with the NYPD...

746
00:59:44,698 --> 00:59:47,321
greediest, most corrupt pigs
on the face of the earth.

747
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:50,660
So I got the fuck out.

748
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:53,915
I told that motherfucker I'd rather
eat cat shit with a knittin' needle.

749
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,842
I wasn't gonna bust my ass sendin'
some cop kids to college. Shit.

750
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:01,807
I dig it.

751
01:00:01,896 --> 01:00:04,388
This place ain't never
made much money.

752
01:00:04,525 --> 01:00:08,146
So I'm just hustlin' here and there.

753
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,567
Tryin' to get over,
just like everybody else.

754
01:00:14,918 --> 01:00:17,043
It's gonna be all right, kid.

755
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,839
Here's to gettin' over.

756
01:00:20,929 --> 01:00:24,467
I hope, man. Hope. Shit.

757
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:31,611
- You afraid of blood?
- Uh, that's all I been around
for the past three years.

758
01:00:34,537 --> 01:00:36,864
Anthony Curtis.

759
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:40,246
You related to Tony?
The actor?

760
01:00:40,381 --> 01:00:44,714
N-No. Not...
Oh! The act... No, no, no.

761
01:00:44,847 --> 01:00:47,804
- Different colour, right?
- Yeah! He's a white cat. Yeah.

762
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:51,557
And his name was Schwartz.
Schwartz, not Curtis.

763
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:54,524
- Okay.
- Know anything about butchering?

764
01:00:54,615 --> 01:00:56,408
Uh, I'm a fast learner.

765
01:00:56,493 --> 01:00:58,404
Here, put that on.

766
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:01,999
- Here. Take this.
- Need some help, man!

767
01:01:02,128 --> 01:01:04,123
All right.

768
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:26,492
Hey, uh, is Juanita in?

769
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,953
No, she's not,
but she'll be back in a...

770
01:01:31,129 --> 01:01:33,040
in a while.

771
01:01:35,303 --> 01:01:38,509
So you gonna stand out there,
or you comin' in?

772
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:40,512
I'm gonna come on in.

773
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:45,394
Girl, check you out.

774
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:52,205
I thought you were goin' over
to the communists.

775
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:55,829
Ah. Nah. Not me.

776
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:58,458
Now, dig, if you were smart,
that's what you would've done.

777
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:00,636
What?

778
01:02:00,765 --> 01:02:03,472
Man, you don't know what the hell
you talkin' about, girl.

779
01:02:03,603 --> 01:02:07,687
No, it's cool. I mean it's not your
fault you been brainwashed by America.

780
01:02:10,324 --> 01:02:13,161
I mean, at least you made it back
alive, right?

781
01:02:13,288 --> 01:02:16,660
You know, "Hello, how you doin'?"
That would've been real nice...

782
01:02:16,794 --> 01:02:19,999
before you got off
onto all this political shit.

783
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:25,015
Welcome home.

784
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,552
And welcome to the revolution.

785
01:02:31,904 --> 01:02:34,943
- So, this is Sarah's?
- Mm-hmm.

786
01:02:36,913 --> 01:02:38,824
Oh, wow.

787
01:02:41,379 --> 01:02:45,796
- So, is she a smart baby?
- Ahh.

788
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,131
Why don't you find out for yourself?

789
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:56,530
Hey, y'all. Sorry I'm late.
Traffic on the Cross Bronx was a mess.

790
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:03,241
Oh. All righty.

791
01:03:03,377 --> 01:03:05,537
There we go.

792
01:03:05,673 --> 01:03:07,466
There you go.

793
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:10,086
Go play with your blocks.
Go play with your blocks.

794
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:21,901
Hey.

795
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:36,303
Oh, no. Look, Juanita.
I'm in one piece.

796
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,654
Hey, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

797
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:47,534
Come here, Sarah.
Come to Mommy.

798
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:51,831
Good girl. Come here.
Look at that.

799
01:03:51,964 --> 01:03:54,539
- That's Daddy. Say hi.
- Hi.

800
01:03:54,677 --> 01:03:57,005
This is Sarah Marie Curtis.

801
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,218
- Hi.
- Hello.

802
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:02,106
Hold her, silly. She's yours.

803
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,066
Oh.

804
01:04:04,194 --> 01:04:06,603
Hey. Mmm.

805
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,862
Hey, um...

806
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,419
Oh, yeah. Be advised.
What's goin' on, my brothers?

807
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,010
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah. This is home.

808
01:04:22,143 --> 01:04:24,636
Dig it. Dig it.

809
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:26,559
Check out Sleepin' Beauty
back there.

810
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:32,075
Boy, I still can't get over
how gorgeous she is.

811
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:34,113
Oh, she got that from her mama.

812
01:04:34,248 --> 01:04:36,207
Oh. Okay.

813
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,250
You know, Juanita...

814
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:47,267
I wanna let you know l...
I did miss you. A lot.

815
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:49,854
Don't you think I know that, Anthony?

816
01:04:49,943 --> 01:04:53,813
It's not important anyway. The important
thing is that you're here now.

817
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:56,324
Shh. Come here.

818
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,410
Oh.

819
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:18,484
Hey, baby girl.

820
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:20,946
Hey, Cutty.

821
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,787
Came by to see you a little earlier,
but you weren't home.

822
01:05:28,678 --> 01:05:30,388
Oh, you know I had class tonight
after work...

823
01:05:30,515 --> 01:05:32,640
and then I stopped over by my mother's.

824
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:38,016
- Oh, yeah. I forgot. It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

825
01:05:39,155 --> 01:05:41,649
I see my little girl's sleepin'
back there, huh?

826
01:05:41,744 --> 01:05:44,663
Yeah. She's all played out.

827
01:05:48,005 --> 01:05:51,459
- Cutty, I wanted you to meet, um...
- Look here.

828
01:05:51,553 --> 01:05:54,046
- Got a little somethin' for Sarah.
- Smiling faces

829
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:59,014
- Buy her something real nice.
- Smiling faces sometimes

830
01:05:59,108 --> 01:06:01,862
Hey, Cutty, I told you
to stop spoilin' her like this.

831
01:06:01,988 --> 01:06:04,315
Smiling faces

832
01:06:04,409 --> 01:06:07,995
Smiling faces tell lies

833
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:11,537
- Somebody's gotta do it.
- And I got proof

834
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:15,756
- Beware
- Cutty, I want you to meet Anthony.

835
01:06:21,022 --> 01:06:23,812
Okay. All right.

836
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:26,947
Let me just put her to bed. You come on
in and make yourself at home.

837
01:06:27,074 --> 01:06:28,950
Come on in.

838
01:06:53,288 --> 01:06:56,078
Okay. Can I get you something
to drink, or...

839
01:06:56,169 --> 01:06:59,790
Look, Juanita.
Uh, I think I better go.

840
01:06:59,926 --> 01:07:02,086
But you just got here.

841
01:07:02,179 --> 01:07:05,931
Who knows, you could be
expectin' company or something.

842
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,347
Nobody's comin' here, Anthony.

843
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:10,358
I think I still should go.

844
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:17,778
Anthony.

845
01:07:17,873 --> 01:07:20,332
I used to see Cutty.
Is that what you wanna hear?

846
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:23,209
Oh. Blood made that very clear to me.

847
01:07:23,342 --> 01:07:25,419
So then, what's the problem?

848
01:07:25,554 --> 01:07:27,844
Problem?

849
01:07:27,934 --> 01:07:31,850
Why, man throwed two yards on your car.

850
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:35,110
You askin' me what's the problem?
Shit. Obviously nothin'.

851
01:07:35,238 --> 01:07:37,197
Don't come up in here judgin' me.

852
01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:39,996
What the fuck, man?
You got a pimp around my daughter?

853
01:07:40,081 --> 01:07:41,873
Oh, he is not a pimp.

854
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,209
And besides, if you cared anything
about havin' a daughter...

855
01:07:44,338 --> 01:07:46,913
you'd have wrote me back
after I sent you our picture.

856
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:49,092
But don't jump on me
for havin' a life.

857
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:51,512
You didn't want one with me.

858
01:07:53,396 --> 01:07:56,649
So now what?

859
01:07:56,777 --> 01:07:59,733
Are you gonna leave?

860
01:07:59,865 --> 01:08:01,741
Some bullshit.

861
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:11,382
Come here.

862
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:14,141
Come on. Come here.

863
01:08:26,998 --> 01:08:28,908
Ooh, hey

864
01:08:30,462 --> 01:08:33,133
Ya gotta, gotta payback
Payback

865
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:35,467
- Damn!
- Revenge

866
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:43,896
A man
The big payback

867
01:08:44,028 --> 01:08:45,986
Got to get back

868
01:08:46,115 --> 01:08:48,323
Cleanup time, Cowboy.

869
01:08:48,453 --> 01:08:51,906
See, man, why the fuck
you always gotta talk some shit?

870
01:08:52,042 --> 01:08:55,580
Payback
Right there

871
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,838
- See, that's why I kicked his fuckin'
ass when he was a little kid, man.
- Payback

872
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,765
- Always gettin' smart and shit.
- A man

873
01:09:02,895 --> 01:09:05,388
Get down with my girlfriend

874
01:09:06,777 --> 01:09:09,484
That ain't right

875
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:12,238
Now you gonna play this marine
war hero.

876
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:14,531
Out of touch

877
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,749
You know what I think?

878
01:09:16,879 --> 01:09:19,585
- I think y'all was some goddam fools
goin' over there...
- Gonna fight

879
01:09:19,717 --> 01:09:22,292
fightin' that white man's war.

880
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:25,433
- That's right.
- Payback everything you got to see

881
01:09:25,519 --> 01:09:28,725
- What you got when you get
back here, huh?
- Yeah

882
01:09:28,817 --> 01:09:31,309
- Never do any damn thing
- Not a goddam thing.

883
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:36,913
Course, you do got
that fine-ass Juanita.

884
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:40,285
- Throw me out
- Now, what the fuck you lookin' at me
like that for, man?

885
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,964
I'm just complimentin' you
on your taste.

886
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:46,636
Throw me away
You had all the rage

887
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,846
- You had me down
- Course you know...

888
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:52,057
- That's the facts
- Baddest motherfucker this side
of Nicky Barnes...

889
01:09:52,191 --> 01:09:54,518
- Now, you punk
- My boss man Cutty...

890
01:09:54,654 --> 01:09:57,194
Gettin' ready for the big payback

891
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,154
I thought that might ring a bell.

892
01:09:59,288 --> 01:10:01,531
The big payback
That's where I learned

893
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:05,121
He used to tap that ass
while you was over in Nam.

894
01:10:05,215 --> 01:10:07,126
- The big payback
- Motherfucker!

895
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:11,551
- Goddam!
- You do some fuckin' talkin',
don't you, goddam it!

896
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:13,478
Try this on, motherfucker.

897
01:10:13,563 --> 01:10:16,186
- No, no, no. He needs his ass whipped.
- What you mean "no"?

898
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:21,318
Get the fuck outta here!
Talk shit now, huh, motherfucker?

899
01:10:21,411 --> 01:10:24,532
- Shut the fuck up. Come on. Come on.
Motherfucker. Now what?
- I'm ready to be respected

900
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:27,124
You wanna fuck with me or what?
I'm gonna fuckin' kill your ass!

901
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:29,878
- Say somethin' now, motherfucker.
- That's enough, youngblood.

902
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:34,264
- Pull out your goddam knife!
- No! That's enough. Come on!

903
01:10:34,392 --> 01:10:36,220
- I gonna kill this motherfucker!
- That's enough!

904
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:38,187
That mother! I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker!

905
01:10:38,274 --> 01:10:40,849
- Let me go, Kirby! Let me go!
- No. He's already beat up. Come on now.

906
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:45,741
- Oh, shit.
- Come on. Let's go get some air.

907
01:10:45,871 --> 01:10:48,245
Don't need no fuckin' air!
Let me go!

908
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,624
- Let me hit him, hit him, hit him
- That's game.

909
01:11:13,212 --> 01:11:15,122
Shit.

910
01:11:15,215 --> 01:11:17,755
Gonna have the aeroplane corn bread.

911
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:20,302
Here we go.
Ooh!

912
01:11:20,391 --> 01:11:22,966
- You gonna spoil that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

913
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:25,858
Gonna spoil that one in your belly too.

914
01:11:25,984 --> 01:11:28,904
I don't need no spoiled kids.

915
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:30,983
Hey, why not?

916
01:11:31,118 --> 01:11:32,911
Not enough black babies are spoiled.

917
01:11:32,996 --> 01:11:35,455
Ain't that right, Sarah, hmm?

918
01:11:35,585 --> 01:11:37,413
You got a point there.

919
01:11:38,506 --> 01:11:40,631
Come on. Sit on down.

920
01:11:42,806 --> 01:11:45,762
Big girl. Come here.

921
01:11:47,523 --> 01:11:49,398
Come here.

922
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,492
Look at you.

923
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,784
Fat girl.

924
01:11:55,871 --> 01:11:58,446
See what we got ourselves here.

925
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:01,630
Oh, you know what? I think we're gonna
have ourselves a little boy.

926
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,342
Yeah, come on, man.
You got to be a boy.

927
01:12:06,473 --> 01:12:09,346
Boy, boy, boy. Mm.

928
01:12:09,478 --> 01:12:14,109
Ant Junior.
See, it's the power of the mind.

929
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:16,730
We will ourselves a little boy.

930
01:12:18,703 --> 01:12:21,030
Then can you will yourself
a better job?

931
01:12:24,672 --> 01:12:27,247
Can you will yourself to stop
drinkin' so much?

932
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:30,259
Come on, honey.
Don't even start that shit, all right?

933
01:12:30,391 --> 01:12:33,596
I thought we supposed to be havin'
a nice time here.

934
01:12:39,908 --> 01:12:41,701
Look, Juanita.

935
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:45,917
l-I'm gonna get myself
a... a good job.

936
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:49,920
You know how long you been singin'
that same old song now, Anthony?

937
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,763
I mean, in case you haven't noticed,
this here's the real world.

938
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:55,263
Ain't no free meals here
like in the marines.

939
01:12:58,149 --> 01:13:01,769
Say, let me tell you somethin'.
Wasn't nothin' free in the marines.

940
01:13:01,864 --> 01:13:04,701
I earned every meal
and every fuckin' dollar, all right?

941
01:13:09,377 --> 01:13:11,288
Look, everything's gonna be cool.

942
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:17,343
You know I'll be
five months next week.

943
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:20,728
You're five months pregnant,
you can't be no nurse's aide.

944
01:13:20,856 --> 01:13:22,731
I said we'll be all right.

945
01:14:04,142 --> 01:14:08,309
Hey, um... Anybody want some speed?

946
01:14:08,442 --> 01:14:11,148
Get the fuck outta here
with that shit.

947
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,653
Say, why don't you
cut the bullshit, Joe?

948
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:16,704
Can't you clear your mind
for one sec, man?

949
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,950
Now, you sure that they
pick up cash money?

950
01:14:19,085 --> 01:14:20,996
Hey, cash money, bro.

951
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:23,540
Like clockwork, once a month.
Then they stop by the post office...

952
01:14:23,635 --> 01:14:26,923
before they make their final run
to Washington, man.

953
01:14:27,016 --> 01:14:29,972
All the way to Washington, D.C.,
where they burn the money.

954
01:14:30,105 --> 01:14:32,265
Can you believe that shit?

955
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:34,935
Old bills, man.
Sometimes a couple million.

956
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:38,117
- How many guards?
- Four.

957
01:14:38,202 --> 01:14:40,826
Two in the front
and one in the back carry revolvers.

958
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:45,623
The other one, 12-gauge shotgun, man.

959
01:14:45,716 --> 01:14:47,509
You think we can take 'em?

960
01:14:50,392 --> 01:14:53,430
I can't say, man.
I mean...

961
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:56,644
four guards, and all of 'em
packin'?

962
01:14:56,736 --> 01:15:00,607
I put up the guns. I get the money
together to get the plans goin'.

963
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:02,702
But you got to be the master planner.

964
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:05,364
You got medals for blowin'
motherfuckers up out there.

965
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:09,752
- Man, I heard you were like John Wayne.
- Well, then that's the deal.

966
01:15:09,884 --> 01:15:12,044
Yeah, all that money.

967
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:14,055
Ah, man.

968
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,191
Anthony. You down?

969
01:15:22,406 --> 01:15:24,282
- Ahh.
- The look

970
01:15:25,663 --> 01:15:28,582
- Of love
- Let's drink on it anyway.

971
01:15:28,668 --> 01:15:33,168
- Is in your eyes
- Mmm.

972
01:15:34,804 --> 01:15:36,799
- Ahh.
- A look

973
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:38,927
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Your heart

974
01:15:39,062 --> 01:15:43,193
- Say, man. Shhh.
- Can't disguise
- Hmm?

975
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:47,023
Put the goddam thing away.
Get your little pyromaniac ass...

976
01:15:47,118 --> 01:15:49,907
- You gonna be walkin' in a minute.
- Aw, cool out, Kirby, man.

977
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:52,747
I'm not gonna burn your car.
Not yet, at least.

978
01:16:00,934 --> 01:16:04,103
Don't go

979
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,605
Forget it, Juanita.

980
01:16:06,694 --> 01:16:08,605
Come on. Watch out there.

981
01:16:12,413 --> 01:16:14,621
The look of love

982
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:20,212
What's the problem, Anthony?

983
01:16:20,344 --> 01:16:24,047
What is it? I mean,
is it because I'm pregnant?

984
01:16:24,184 --> 01:16:25,929
Shh. Come on.
Now, don't be silly.

985
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:27,931
So, then what's the problem?

986
01:16:32,156 --> 01:16:34,032
Come on. Talk to me.
What is it?

987
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:41,965
I told you. You need to
leave that alcohol alone.

988
01:17:06,885 --> 01:17:09,675
- No! No!
- Anthony! Anthony, baby!

989
01:17:09,766 --> 01:17:11,890
It's me.
It's me. It's all right.

990
01:17:11,978 --> 01:17:13,889
It's all right.
Come here.

991
01:17:13,981 --> 01:17:18,647
Shh. Shh. Shh.
It's just another dream.

992
01:17:18,781 --> 01:17:20,657
It's just another dream.

993
01:17:28,424 --> 01:17:30,667
This is my best cut,
Mrs Stein. Enjoy.

994
01:17:30,803 --> 01:17:33,343
Thank you very much, Saul.

995
01:17:33,475 --> 01:17:37,178
- He's such a nice man.
- What did he give you?

996
01:17:37,315 --> 01:17:39,356
- We need to talk.
- Oh.

997
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,412
- So what's happenin'?
- You're a good man.

998
01:17:46,498 --> 01:17:50,368
Aw, come on, Saul.
I ain't got time to kibitz with ya.
I got a whole lot of meat to cut.

999
01:17:52,592 --> 01:17:54,503
I'm closing down the shop.

1000
01:17:56,641 --> 01:17:59,312
Should've told you sooner,
but I thought maybe...

1001
01:17:59,395 --> 01:18:01,972
business, you know,
pick up a little.

1002
01:18:03,696 --> 01:18:05,356
Sorry.

1003
01:18:07,118 --> 01:18:10,537
- Here.
- Oh, no, look, Saul... No. I can't.

1004
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,623
What am I gonna do with it?
I have to get rid of it.

1005
01:18:13,714 --> 01:18:15,422
Come on.

1006
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,141
Now I know

1007
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:29,020
We have great respect

1008
01:18:29,157 --> 01:18:32,031
For the sister and mother

1009
01:18:32,163 --> 01:18:34,038
It's even better yet

1010
01:18:36,504 --> 01:18:39,079
But there's the joker in the street

1011
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:43,218
Here you go, brother.
Don't let the bullshit get to you.

1012
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:45,218
I'm tryin', man. I'm tryin'.

1013
01:18:45,311 --> 01:18:47,519
You wanna get the man's foot
off your neck?

1014
01:18:47,607 --> 01:18:50,480
Come check us out.

1015
01:18:50,612 --> 01:18:53,449
Take care of yourself, brother.
Live righteous.

1016
01:18:53,576 --> 01:18:55,950
Here you go, brother.
Here you go.

1017
01:18:56,081 --> 01:18:59,119
Take care of yourself, brother.
Come see us now.

1018
01:18:59,253 --> 01:19:01,413
Don't let us hang around this town

1019
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:05,805
- Here you go, sister.
- And let what others say come true

1020
01:19:05,932 --> 01:19:07,510
Brothers and sisters, here you go.

1021
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:26,377
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Hey, youngblood.

1022
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:31,642
Bringin' in the groceries, huh?

1023
01:19:33,188 --> 01:19:35,681
Lord, have mercy.

1024
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:38,490
Man, I remember
when I was married.

1025
01:19:38,615 --> 01:19:41,784
I used to love
to bring home the groceries.

1026
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:44,364
Made me feel real good.

1027
01:19:44,501 --> 01:19:48,549
Like a man. Know what I mean?

1028
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:51,678
Hey, listen, youngblood. Uh...

1029
01:19:51,805 --> 01:19:53,764
I just dropped by
to see Juanita and Sarah.

1030
01:19:53,892 --> 01:19:56,896
- You know, lay a little
somethin' on 'em.
- Stopped by to see my baby?

1031
01:19:57,023 --> 01:19:58,684
Is that right?

1032
01:19:58,818 --> 01:20:00,693
You know, youngblood...

1033
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:03,824
I took care of your woman and your baby
when you were in the war.

1034
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:07,364
Now, a man oughta get a little respect
for somethin' like that.

1035
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:09,203
Now, I ain't gonna lie to you.

1036
01:20:09,295 --> 01:20:12,714
I care about Juanita.
I care about her a whole lot.

1037
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:16,849
But you back now, and I'm gone.

1038
01:20:16,934 --> 01:20:20,602
So from this point on, you should
consider me like a friend of the family.

1039
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,892
Find yourself in a jam and shit,
need a little cash...

1040
01:20:23,028 --> 01:20:25,865
you come see me,
I'll front you.

1041
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:28,407
- Keep your shit.
- Listen, brother.

1042
01:20:28,496 --> 01:20:30,740
I know about pride.

1043
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:32,916
But you got mouths to feed.

1044
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:34,956
Now, I laid a little cash
on Juanita.

1045
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:37,928
Say, man, stay the fuck
away from my family.

1046
01:20:38,012 --> 01:20:39,638
What did you say?

1047
01:20:39,766 --> 01:20:42,223
You heard me, goddam it.

1048
01:20:42,312 --> 01:20:44,354
I said, "Stay the fuck away
from my family."

1049
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:48,314
See, I ain't the enemy, youngblood.

1050
01:20:51,161 --> 01:20:53,286
I don't want no trouble.

1051
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:02,464
Shit.

1052
01:21:08,024 --> 01:21:11,527
See, I tried to be a friend,
motherfucker.

1053
01:21:19,212 --> 01:21:21,122
Surprise, nigger.

1054
01:21:23,594 --> 01:21:26,514
Big bad marines.

1055
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,510
Look at you now.

1056
01:21:29,688 --> 01:21:32,228
Does she suck you?

1057
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,903
Fuck you?

1058
01:21:35,032 --> 01:21:37,703
Make you feel like a man?

1059
01:21:37,786 --> 01:21:39,697
Make you feel real good?

1060
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:44,547
Huh, boy?

1061
01:21:44,674 --> 01:21:47,547
Now, she wasn't doin' it like that
before you went to the war, now was she?

1062
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:54,478
Now you gettin'
all that good lovin'...

1063
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:58,615
and you can't even put food
on your fuckin' table.

1064
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:04,031
Come on, Santa Claus.
Open your mouth and suck this.

1065
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:06,748
Come on. I got a present for you.
Suck it!

1066
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,417
- Suck it, nigger!
- Kill me, motherfucker.

1067
01:22:10,511 --> 01:22:12,470
Shoot me right now.

1068
01:22:12,598 --> 01:22:14,427
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1069
01:22:21,072 --> 01:22:23,992
You lucky this is personal, nigger.

1070
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:26,279
I ain't gonna kill you
over no woman.

1071
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,495
Don't you ever...

1072
01:22:29,629 --> 01:22:31,623
in your fuckin' life...

1073
01:22:32,801 --> 01:22:35,377
bite the hand
that feeds you, nigger.

1074
01:22:42,485 --> 01:22:44,775
See ya, Santa Claus.

1075
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:53,584
- Hold still now.
- I'm all right.

1076
01:22:53,714 --> 01:22:56,088
- Hold still.
- No, I'm all right. Damn!

1077
01:23:12,914 --> 01:23:15,871
You givin' him that money back.

1078
01:23:15,962 --> 01:23:18,419
He won't take it back.

1079
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:22,716
What the fuck you talkin'...
You better get his shit back to him!

1080
01:23:22,849 --> 01:23:26,850
Even if I wanted to give it back to him,
Anthony, he wouldn't take it back.

1081
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:30,940
W-W-W-Wait. What the fuck you talkin'
about, "if you wanted to give it back"?

1082
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:33,861
No, no, no, no.
Fuck that shit.

1083
01:23:33,953 --> 01:23:37,538
Have you forgotten you just lost your
damn job? We need that fuckin' money.

1084
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:40,379
- We don't need his money.
- Yeah, well, Anthony,
I'll tell you what.

1085
01:23:40,464 --> 01:23:44,880
You start bringin' some real money
in here, like a real man, and then
I'll think about givin' it back to him.

1086
01:23:44,972 --> 01:23:48,510
Until then, I don't wanna hear shit.

1087
01:23:48,645 --> 01:23:53,442
You need to get your tight ass together,
that's what you need to do, and stop
feelin' sorry for your damn self.

1088
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:57,442
Sometimes it's like you ain't even
the same man I knew before the war.

1089
01:23:57,578 --> 01:24:00,617
That's who I was in love with.
That's who I thought showed
the fuck back up here.

1090
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:03,624
I don't know who the fuck you are.

1091
01:24:03,714 --> 01:24:06,551
So, what? You just, uh,
suck his dick so good...

1092
01:24:06,677 --> 01:24:09,765
he just start
throwin' money at you, right?

1093
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,512
What is with you?

1094
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:14,683
Why you so damn paranoid?
I ain't fuckin' him.

1095
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:16,858
Not at this moment, you ain't. No.

1096
01:24:16,987 --> 01:24:18,697
But the motherfucker
ain't sniffin' around here...

1097
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:21,614
tossin' money in your
motherfuckin' face for nothin'!

1098
01:24:21,705 --> 01:24:24,827
Yeah, well, I sleep with you
every night, don't I?

1099
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,297
You know, Juanita,
that's a damn good question.

1100
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:32,931
Come on. Go ahead.

1101
01:24:33,058 --> 01:24:35,765
Admit this shit, man. Be honest.
You fuckin' him, right?

1102
01:24:35,897 --> 01:24:38,390
- Is that what you wanna hear, Anthony?
That's what you wanna hear?
- Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.

1103
01:24:38,526 --> 01:24:41,233
Fine. I'm fuckin' him.

1104
01:24:44,787 --> 01:24:47,660
So, uh, whose baby is that?

1105
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:53,166
D-Don't even answer that shit.

1106
01:24:53,261 --> 01:24:55,385
No, you right. I ain't gonna answer it.
I mean, shit. You Anthony.

1107
01:24:55,473 --> 01:24:58,927
You the big marine man with no damn job.
You know every fuckin' thing.

1108
01:24:59,063 --> 01:25:05,070
Answer this for me: If you think
I'm jivin' you so much, Anthony,
why the hell you with me? Huh?

1109
01:25:05,157 --> 01:25:09,110
Why the fuck you with me?
What, you think I need you?
Do you think I need this shit?

1110
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:11,621
Fuck. You can't get a decent job,
you won't fuck me.

1111
01:25:11,752 --> 01:25:14,542
The only time I get to
hold you is when you're havin'
one of them silly-ass nightmares...

1112
01:25:14,632 --> 01:25:16,591
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1113
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:19,217
You don't know, girl.
You really don't know.

1114
01:25:22,313 --> 01:25:25,020
- Don't you fuckin' walk away from...
- You better get the fuck off of me!

1115
01:25:25,151 --> 01:25:28,071
- Don't walk away from me, Anthony.
- Let me go.

1116
01:25:28,157 --> 01:25:30,484
- Don't you... What about Sarah?
- I'll fuckin' kill you, girl!

1117
01:25:30,619 --> 01:25:34,122
Don't you ever run up on me! Ever!
Ever run up on me again!

1118
01:25:34,251 --> 01:25:37,955
I'll fuckin' kill you, Juanita!
Get the fuck off me!

1119
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,959
Bunch of shit!

1120
01:25:58,711 --> 01:26:01,204
- Yeah!
- That's right. You can't trust them!

1121
01:26:04,889 --> 01:26:08,760
- Now, they send our men
off to Vietnam...
- That's what they do.

1122
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,315
to fight for this
so-called democracy.

1123
01:26:12,403 --> 01:26:14,860
- That's right. Preach, sister.
- Yeah! Yeah!

1124
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:16,985
But when they get back down
to the South Bronx...

1125
01:26:17,077 --> 01:26:20,247
and to Bed-Stuy and Harlem
and Watts, etc., etc...

1126
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,082
shit is worse than ever.

1127
01:26:26,762 --> 01:26:30,465
- There is something
very sick about that.
- He's a devil.

1128
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,430
That's right,
he's the devil.

1129
01:26:34,609 --> 01:26:36,769
That's right!

1130
01:26:39,367 --> 01:26:42,822
Go, sister! Go on!

1131
01:26:42,957 --> 01:26:45,580
- Power to the people!
- Power to the people!

1132
01:26:47,632 --> 01:26:50,838
- In 'n' out.
- Never, never gonna give you up

1133
01:26:50,971 --> 01:26:53,595
I'm never, ever gonna stop

1134
01:26:53,684 --> 01:26:56,094
Not the way
I feel about you

1135
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:59,353
- Girl, I just can't live without you
- There you go.

1136
01:26:59,486 --> 01:27:01,813
- I'm never, ever gonna quit
- What can I get you, baby?

1137
01:27:01,949 --> 01:27:04,323
Anyway, so like I was sayin',
I ran into this brother...

1138
01:27:04,454 --> 01:27:06,412
and he, uh, gave me
this flyer.

1139
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,743
So I figured I'd go over
and check it out.

1140
01:27:08,837 --> 01:27:14,048
And there you were, up there
talkin' that ol' righteous shit.

1141
01:27:14,179 --> 01:27:18,346
I'm just a college student
tryin' to do her part to rally
the people together.

1142
01:27:18,478 --> 01:27:22,812
But, dig, we need more
than talk. It's... It's time to do.

1143
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:25,479
- Do what?
- Revolution.

1144
01:27:25,575 --> 01:27:28,662
Oh, wait a minute. See.
Y'all a little outta my league now.

1145
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:30,908
Is that what you're gonna say
when the revolution comes?

1146
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:33,999
W-When it's time
to pick up a gun?

1147
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:36,001
What you know
about weapons?

1148
01:27:37,972 --> 01:27:40,049
I'm qualified
to handle a.45...

1149
01:27:40,184 --> 01:27:43,354
an M-16 rifle,
a.38-calibre pistol...

1150
01:27:43,482 --> 01:27:45,523
and a Russian AK-47.

1151
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:48,864
An AK-47?

1152
01:27:52,957 --> 01:27:54,952
Why don't you join us?

1153
01:27:55,086 --> 01:27:57,875
A lot of brothers
from the war have.

1154
01:27:58,008 --> 01:28:01,095
Baby, I got enough
heavy shit to deal with.

1155
01:28:08,777 --> 01:28:10,855
- I got you, brother.
- Relax.

1156
01:28:13,744 --> 01:28:16,071
You're so uptight.

1157
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:19,330
Damn, I got to make
some fuckin' bread.

1158
01:28:19,463 --> 01:28:22,382
I'm through
with your sister, but...

1159
01:28:22,468 --> 01:28:26,089
I still got to take care
of my baby girl, Sarah.

1160
01:28:26,225 --> 01:28:29,182
Shit, and the one
that's on the way.

1161
01:28:29,314 --> 01:28:31,807
Damn!

1162
01:28:31,943 --> 01:28:36,276
Look, anyway, uh, I got
this plan to make some money.

1163
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,949
I want you to keep
this shit to yourself.

1164
01:28:41,252 --> 01:28:44,374
At 6:15 a.m., the truck
pulls outta the post office...

1165
01:28:44,507 --> 01:28:47,760
at 149th and Grand Concourse.

1166
01:28:47,847 --> 01:28:51,100
Now, it makes one stop
before it goes to D. C...

1167
01:28:51,187 --> 01:28:55,353
which is a mail drop-off
at First Federal Loan and Savings...

1168
01:28:55,486 --> 01:28:58,442
which is on Noble Street
and West.

1169
01:28:58,532 --> 01:29:00,443
Now, Kirby...

1170
01:29:00,536 --> 01:29:02,530
you're gonna position yourself
in a getaway car...

1171
01:29:02,665 --> 01:29:06,001
at the end of the corner,
where you can see everything.

1172
01:29:06,088 --> 01:29:10,338
Jose. Me and you gonna
position ourselves behind the bank...

1173
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:15,094
underneath the left
and the right side of the loadin' dock.

1174
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:19,396
Delilah, you're gonna position
yourself inside the Dumpster...

1175
01:29:19,529 --> 01:29:22,615
which is located directly across
from the loadin' dock.

1176
01:29:25,623 --> 01:29:28,246
Now, Skippy, I want you
to position yourself...

1177
01:29:28,378 --> 01:29:31,584
approximately ten feet
from the alleyway.

1178
01:29:31,717 --> 01:29:35,171
There, you post
a lookout.

1179
01:29:35,266 --> 01:29:37,175
We all know what to do
at the point of attack...

1180
01:29:37,268 --> 01:29:40,142
because we've gone
over that shit enough.

1181
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:44,939
If anybody gets caught, you shut
the fuck up, and we'll keep your money.

1182
01:29:45,074 --> 01:29:47,615
Shh! Fuck that shit, man.

1183
01:29:47,746 --> 01:29:50,203
I'm telling you right now,
if I get caught...

1184
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:55,002
- I'm shooting my fuckin' way out.
- Nigger, put that shit down.

1185
01:29:55,133 --> 01:29:57,971
I think we need another man
on the street with Skip.

1186
01:29:58,098 --> 01:29:59,926
Someone to cover
the other side.

1187
01:30:00,018 --> 01:30:02,974
- I agree.
- Oh, man! Hell, no!

1188
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,100
We don't need no 'nother man.
Shit, I can see.

1189
01:30:05,193 --> 01:30:08,612
- Besides, we got too many
motherfuckers anyway.
- Fuck that shit, Kirby, man.

1190
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,787
Everybody trusts
everybody here, right?

1191
01:30:15,211 --> 01:30:17,336
I can get somebody
from our organization.

1192
01:30:17,465 --> 01:30:21,597
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't want none of them
revolutionary niggers involved.

1193
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:24,139
You can cut your eye at me
all you want to.

1194
01:30:24,269 --> 01:30:26,477
I ain't too keen on havin'
that broad up in here neither.

1195
01:30:26,607 --> 01:30:30,061
Well, you the one talkin' about
we need another man.
Make up your goddam mind.

1196
01:30:30,197 --> 01:30:33,034
You have somebody in mind,
Anthony?

1197
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:36,828
We might as well put
a motherfuckin' ad in the paper.
Then we gonna get everybody.

1198
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:39,748
Shit, ain't gonna be
no money left for a nigger.

1199
01:30:43,637 --> 01:30:47,590
Oh, yes! Y'all didn't know
your reverend was a gamblin' man?

1200
01:30:47,728 --> 01:30:51,860
A sinnin' man?

1201
01:30:51,944 --> 01:30:54,781
I was a man who maimed!

1202
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:58,786
I was a man who killed!

1203
01:31:01,002 --> 01:31:05,501
We all know it was done
in the name of the wicked one.

1204
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:09,546
The one that was
cast down from heaven.

1205
01:31:09,683 --> 01:31:13,138
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

1206
01:31:13,273 --> 01:31:17,737
I said y'all know
who I'm talkin' about!

1207
01:31:17,866 --> 01:31:20,537
Can I get a "hallelujah"
in this house of God?

1208
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,780
Hallelujah!

1209
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:24,495
Hallelujah!

1210
01:31:24,627 --> 01:31:28,082
Well, look here, man.
Skip is in. Period. All right?

1211
01:31:28,176 --> 01:31:31,927
I stand a lot to lose
if this thing blows up in my face.

1212
01:31:32,058 --> 01:31:35,096
The last time I saw him, he was
shooting poison in his veins.

1213
01:31:35,188 --> 01:31:38,227
Yeah, I know. Well, you know,
he's tryin' to shake that shit, man.

1214
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:42,236
- He's still on drugs.
- And I still trust him
with my life, Cleon.

1215
01:31:43,996 --> 01:31:47,497
Remember that last battle?

1216
01:31:47,626 --> 01:31:49,537
He froze up.

1217
01:31:49,672 --> 01:31:53,257
For a minute.
Then h-he broke out of it.

1218
01:31:53,345 --> 01:31:57,975
And when he "broke out of it,"
Dugan was dead.

1219
01:31:58,062 --> 01:32:00,306
Come on, Cleon. You know that
could've happened to any of us.

1220
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,151
Now either you in
or you out. Which one?

1221
01:32:04,282 --> 01:32:06,822
How much money did you say
was in that truck?

1222
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:31,750
We still got
about 15 minutes.

1223
01:34:31,837 --> 01:34:34,246
I tell ya, I could've
used another cup of coffee.

1224
01:34:34,383 --> 01:34:36,258
Let's make this quick.

1225
01:34:43,483 --> 01:34:45,358
Bank security.

1226
01:34:51,372 --> 01:34:53,283
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

1227
01:34:53,376 --> 01:34:55,287
- Mornin'.
- Good mornin'.

1228
01:35:31,444 --> 01:35:33,652
Oh, f...

1229
01:35:47,932 --> 01:35:50,720
You waitin' on
the number 11 bus?

1230
01:35:50,853 --> 01:35:52,764
Yes.

1231
01:35:52,898 --> 01:35:55,902
I don't think
she runs this early.

1232
01:35:56,029 --> 01:36:00,576
I caught it the other morning,
uh, at this same time.

1233
01:36:00,704 --> 01:36:02,081
You sure about that?

1234
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,369
Uh-huh.

1235
01:36:05,463 --> 01:36:08,751
- Let me check for you.
- No need to go to any trouble, Officer.

1236
01:36:08,885 --> 01:36:10,761
No, no, no.
No trouble at all, brother.

1237
01:36:13,811 --> 01:36:16,933
I see by that patch
on your jacket you were in recon.

1238
01:36:17,066 --> 01:36:21,281
I was a 5th marine. Always willin'
to help out a fellow leatherneck.

1239
01:36:26,667 --> 01:36:28,578
Brown on patrol.
Brown on patrol.

1240
01:36:28,671 --> 01:36:32,125
Requesting off-hour route check
on number 11.

1241
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:34,794
Dispatch to Brown.
Hold for schedule.

1242
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:36,801
That's a copy.

1243
01:36:36,894 --> 01:36:39,102
Do somethin', Cleon.

1244
01:37:14,878 --> 01:37:17,882
- Ambush! Ambush!
- Drop it, motherfucker!

1245
01:37:53,405 --> 01:37:55,981
What the hell?

1246
01:37:58,331 --> 01:38:00,124
Shit!

1247
01:38:32,935 --> 01:38:36,021
Joe! Come on. Let's move.

1248
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:48,957
Oh, goddam it!

1249
01:39:29,744 --> 01:39:32,582
Fuck! Shit!

1250
01:39:39,053 --> 01:39:41,676
Oh, shit!

1251
01:39:43,185 --> 01:39:45,310
Anthony!

1252
01:40:18,958 --> 01:40:22,246
- Did you see that shit, man?
- Hey, what the fuck wrong with you?

1253
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,754
- See the way the fuckin' doors
blew off, man?
- No, motherfucker!

1254
01:40:24,843 --> 01:40:27,217
Motherfuckin' Joe, you blew
the whole motherfuckin'
truck up, motherfucker!

1255
01:40:27,306 --> 01:40:29,846
- It blew up like that, man!
- That's how you fucked
your hand up last time!

1256
01:40:29,977 --> 01:40:32,470
You... And the money... You fucked up.
I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass!

1257
01:40:32,607 --> 01:40:35,100
Grab what you can, motherfucker,
before the whole thing burns!

1258
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:37,273
Hey, Anthony and Delilah
gotta see this shit, man.

1259
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:39,615
I'm gonna go get 'em!
Hey, Anthony!

1260
01:40:41,498 --> 01:40:45,202
You gotta see the shit I did, man.
I blew that shit up, man!

1261
01:40:45,338 --> 01:40:48,792
You gotta see it, man!
You gotta see the shit I did!

1262
01:40:51,057 --> 01:40:53,632
Let's get outta here.
Put the gun down. Put the gun down.

1263
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:55,681
Come on, Delilah.
Let's get up. Up. Let's go.

1264
01:40:57,861 --> 01:41:00,697
Come on, bro.

1265
01:41:00,824 --> 01:41:03,744
We gotta go, man.

1266
01:41:03,871 --> 01:41:06,993
I can't...
I can't leave her.

1267
01:41:07,086 --> 01:41:10,005
You ain't gotta
leave her, bro...

1268
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:12,583
'cause she's already gone.

1269
01:41:16,811 --> 01:41:18,354
Get up here!
Go on!

1270
01:42:17,837 --> 01:42:20,756
Unit 1004, do you copy?

1271
01:42:20,842 --> 01:42:23,050
Please respond.

1272
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:27,132
Do you require assistance?
Do you copy?

1273
01:42:27,228 --> 01:42:29,556
Any available units
in the vicinity of Noble Street.

1274
01:42:29,692 --> 01:42:32,019
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three. Repeat.

1275
01:42:32,154 --> 01:42:34,195
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three.

1276
01:43:03,501 --> 01:43:06,375
God's not gonna
forgive me for this one.

1277
01:43:06,507 --> 01:43:10,674
I'll tell you what, Reverend.
With this kind of money, you can
buy your way into heaven.

1278
01:43:12,435 --> 01:43:15,188
That's where you're wrong, brother.

1279
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:19,903
We done bought our way into hell.

1280
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:24,073
The plain fact is that I promised
the Lord I would never sin like this.

1281
01:43:26,752 --> 01:43:30,124
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure
I even want any of this dirty money.

1282
01:43:31,635 --> 01:43:34,211
Well, I'll tell you what,
Reverend.

1283
01:43:34,307 --> 01:43:36,218
We'll find somethin'
to do with your share.

1284
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:40,181
- Amen to that shit.
- No. No, no, no, no.

1285
01:43:40,318 --> 01:43:42,989
- I'll take the money.
- You lyin' sack o' shit.

1286
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:48,329
I'm sure the Lord will find
another way for me to do my penance.

1287
01:43:50,169 --> 01:43:52,496
Just tell me
one thing, Cleon.

1288
01:43:52,631 --> 01:43:54,958
Why the fuck
you didn't grab the cop?

1289
01:43:55,052 --> 01:43:58,341
You killed him.
A young brother.

1290
01:43:58,475 --> 01:44:01,811
If you wouldn't have froze up like
a bitch, maybe I wouldn't have had
to do that shit, now wouldn't I?

1291
01:44:01,897 --> 01:44:04,057
Would y'all
shut the fuck up?

1292
01:44:05,571 --> 01:44:08,859
Man, Delilah. Shit.

1293
01:44:08,994 --> 01:44:12,164
Man, radio said they got
Joe's stupid ass.

1294
01:44:12,292 --> 01:44:15,994
Fucked it up.
The whole plan was fucked up.

1295
01:44:18,803 --> 01:44:21,841
We ain't do shit right
out there, man. Shit.

1296
01:44:24,731 --> 01:44:28,814
Y'all make sure that Jose's share
goes to Marisol and his kids.

1297
01:44:28,905 --> 01:44:30,946
- Walk on by
- Done.

1298
01:44:37,294 --> 01:44:40,417
Your junkie ass really
messed up out there.

1299
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:42,211
Don't blame me
for your fuck-ups.

1300
01:44:42,304 --> 01:44:47,764
I told Anthony I didn't want nothin' to
do with a crazy, devil-filled junkie!

1301
01:44:47,896 --> 01:44:50,651
- What?
- You listenin' to me? Look at him.

1302
01:44:52,029 --> 01:44:55,033
- Oh, shit!
- Now say some more shit!

1303
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:57,029
I'll knock your ass
right back down.

1304
01:44:57,122 --> 01:44:59,875
Fake-ass wanna-be preacher,
no-members-havin' motherfucker!

1305
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,961
Why don't y'all stop actin'
like some fuckin' clowns?

1306
01:45:04,092 --> 01:45:07,049
You know, you niggers
sure is silly.

1307
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:10,808
Now, you're standin' here fightin',
and we got over $300,000...

1308
01:45:10,938 --> 01:45:14,226
of cold, hard, unmarked U.S. cash
to split up five ways.

1309
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:17,773
Let me tell ya somethin'.
You make me lose count again,
I'm gonna shoot me a motherfucker...

1310
01:45:17,909 --> 01:45:19,950
and then we gonna be splittin'
this thing up four ways, hear?

1311
01:45:23,252 --> 01:45:27,383
Man, I can't believe this.
They was gonna burn all this shit.

1312
01:45:27,509 --> 01:45:30,465
All this shit, and a nigger
can't even find a job.

1313
01:45:32,059 --> 01:45:36,012
Well, that's Uncle Sam
for you, baby.

1314
01:45:36,149 --> 01:45:38,025
Money to burn.

1315
01:45:40,658 --> 01:45:43,661
Police have issued an all-points
bulletin for the remaining...

1316
01:45:43,747 --> 01:45:45,657
...Reserve Bank
on Noble Street.

1317
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:47,246
Faces painted skeleton white.

1318
01:45:47,378 --> 01:45:50,132
Cobra, request your status.
Over.

1319
01:45:50,216 --> 01:45:52,092
- Five federal security guards...
- Anthony!

1320
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,974
- She's already gone.
- Do it. Kill me.

1321
01:45:55,059 --> 01:45:56,720
The bloody shootout erupted...
an armoured truck... explosives...

1322
01:45:56,854 --> 01:46:00,556
No, motherfuckin' Joe.
You blew the whole
motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

1323
01:46:00,693 --> 01:46:02,023
...the deaths of nine people.

1324
01:46:02,113 --> 01:46:05,698
The heroin ain't never
did nothin' to me.

1325
01:46:05,786 --> 01:46:08,160
...just moments away from the scene
of the crime... Robbery turned bloody...

1326
01:46:08,248 --> 01:46:11,751
- Had some shit got
into me over there, man.
- Crushed to death by...

1327
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:14,967
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

1328
01:46:15,095 --> 01:46:18,216
Had a very shiny nose

1329
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:20,309
- And if you ever saw it
- What you slowin' down for?

1330
01:46:20,437 --> 01:46:21,636
- Be cool. Be cool.
- What you doin'?

1331
01:46:21,773 --> 01:46:25,311
- Come on. Come on.
- What the fuck, man? Aw, shit!

1332
01:46:25,446 --> 01:46:29,150
- All of the other reindeer
- What the fuck we doin' over here?

1333
01:46:29,287 --> 01:46:31,862
- Say, man, check out all these kids.
- Man!

1334
01:46:31,958 --> 01:46:33,833
Hey, let's go to the liquor store
and go to the club.

1335
01:46:33,961 --> 01:46:36,715
Look, man, I'm gonna take care of you.
We're gonna go down to the club.

1336
01:46:36,799 --> 01:46:38,877
- We don't know them motherfuckers!
- That's the whole point, baby.

1337
01:46:38,971 --> 01:46:41,345
Come on. Get in the spirit.
Hey, y'all come on over here!

1338
01:46:41,475 --> 01:46:44,597
- Nigger, we gonna get robbed.
- Hey, be cool, nigger.
Y'all come on over here.

1339
01:46:44,689 --> 01:46:49,569
- Be cool, man. Damn.
- Rudolph, with your nose so bright

1340
01:46:49,656 --> 01:46:51,781
All of y'all gonna get some.
All right. All right.

1341
01:46:51,868 --> 01:46:53,779
- Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
- What, motherfu...

1342
01:46:53,872 --> 01:46:56,032
Yeah, man. Merry Christmas,
motherfucker. Go on. Leave me alone.

1343
01:46:56,168 --> 01:46:59,955
Say, say, Skippy. Hey, man,
why don't you bring your ass
over here and quit that jivin'.

1344
01:47:00,091 --> 01:47:03,047
Come on. Yeah, yeah. Y'all take
all the toys. All right. Get one.

1345
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:05,756
- See what I'm sayin'?
I ain't kiddin'. We givin' it away.
- All right. All right. Yeah.

1346
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:08,808
That's why Santa Claus don't wanna
come 'round here 'cause he's scared
he's gonna get shot or robbed.

1347
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:13,903
All right. Just one. Hey, hey, hey.
Give me this, man. Get a... Get a...
Get a toy.

1348
01:47:14,033 --> 01:47:16,074
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Why you stealin'?
You ain't gotta steal.

1349
01:47:16,204 --> 01:47:18,494
- All right, all right, all right.
- Funky little brothers.
I talked to him.

1350
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:21,337
He says he ain't never gonna come down
here unless he's got police protection.

1351
01:47:21,422 --> 01:47:24,211
Last year, one of y'all niggers
stole one of his reindeer.

1352
01:47:31,732 --> 01:47:35,863
No, no. I say let's just go up there
and kill that motherfucker.

1353
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:41,119
Man, me and Anthony gave out
a couple of things, but that was it.

1354
01:47:41,248 --> 01:47:45,201
You gave toys and turkeys to people.
Then you got the hell outta Dodge.

1355
01:47:45,339 --> 01:47:49,720
Man. Y'all sayin' my man is
goin' around handin' out $100 bills...

1356
01:47:49,806 --> 01:47:52,215
and sayin' that
God Almighty gave it to him?

1357
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:56,061
My cousin lives up there
in Mount Vernon. He says that Cleon's
up there actin' a goddam fool.

1358
01:47:56,150 --> 01:47:58,310
That ol' high-profile ass
nigger.

1359
01:47:58,446 --> 01:48:00,321
Bought a brand-new Caddy.

1360
01:48:00,449 --> 01:48:02,159
Folk know he can't afford it.

1361
01:48:02,286 --> 01:48:05,907
- Look, man, I'm gonna go
over there and talk to him.
- No, no, no. Fuck the talk!

1362
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:08,920
I'm drivin' up there, and I'm gonna
take him out before he rats us out.

1363
01:48:09,006 --> 01:48:11,926
Look, Kirby.
I'm gonna handle everything, all right?

1364
01:48:12,054 --> 01:48:15,757
- I'm gonna straighten this shit out.
- All right.

1365
01:48:15,894 --> 01:48:19,431
But if you don't take care of this,
Anthony, I promise you, I will.

1366
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:21,734
I told you we didn't
need another man.

1367
01:48:21,821 --> 01:48:24,741
That's y'all's motherfuckin'
punk-ass friend!

1368
01:48:24,826 --> 01:48:28,280
People runnin' from their worries

1369
01:48:28,416 --> 01:48:30,706
While the judge and his juries

1370
01:48:32,173 --> 01:48:35,675
They take the law
that's part of the flaw

1371
01:48:35,805 --> 01:48:39,806
No. Oh, shit, Cleon!

1372
01:48:39,895 --> 01:48:41,973
Love, fallin', fussin' and a-cussin'

1373
01:48:42,066 --> 01:48:43,645
Damn!

1374
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:47,111
The feelin' now is killin'

1375
01:48:48,661 --> 01:48:50,987
For peace no one is willin'

1376
01:48:52,376 --> 01:48:54,453
Kinda make you get that feelin'

1377
01:48:57,092 --> 01:48:59,003
Everybody's startin'

1378
01:49:00,599 --> 01:49:02,926
Use the pill and the dope

1379
01:49:04,898 --> 01:49:07,058
Educated fools

1380
01:49:08,404 --> 01:49:10,778
From uneducated schools

1381
01:49:14,749 --> 01:49:18,584
Right now we'd like to bring on
a young man who believes in
doing things his own way.

1382
01:49:18,714 --> 01:49:22,003
And based on the way he kinda
get next to all of the folks
who've seen him work...

1383
01:49:22,096 --> 01:49:23,674
his way has gotta be
pretty hip.

1384
01:49:23,765 --> 01:49:27,682
So let's lay some noise
on the mighty Al Green.

1385
01:49:34,952 --> 01:49:36,827
Apartment 13!

1386
01:49:37,999 --> 01:49:40,077
I'm so tired of bein' alone

1387
01:49:40,211 --> 01:49:42,585
I'm so tied up on my own

1388
01:49:42,674 --> 01:49:45,048
Won't you help me, girl

1389
01:49:45,136 --> 01:49:49,600
Just as soon as you can

1390
01:49:55,113 --> 01:49:57,321
Don't move, mister!

1391
01:49:57,450 --> 01:50:00,988
I been wantin' to get
next to you, baby

1392
01:50:01,123 --> 01:50:03,034
You see, sometime
I fold my arms, I say

1393
01:50:03,169 --> 01:50:06,671
- Ooo-ooo
- Mmm-hmm-mmm

1394
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,293
Whoa-oh-oh

1395
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:12,005
Oh, baby, hey

1396
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,307
Needing you has proven to be

1397
01:50:17,402 --> 01:50:20,940
To be my greatest dream
Yeah

1398
01:50:21,034 --> 01:50:24,488
- I'm so tired of being alone
- Oh, tired, baby

1399
01:50:26,795 --> 01:50:29,121
- Here's the rest of the fifties.
- Put it in there.

1400
01:50:31,469 --> 01:50:35,304
You know, I still feel fucked-up
about this whole situation.

1401
01:50:35,393 --> 01:50:39,524
Look, feelin' fucked-up
don't help a goddam thing
and it ain't gonna bring nobody back.

1402
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:43,319
- Shit!
- So, just worry about yourself.
We just gotta get outta here.

1403
01:50:43,407 --> 01:50:47,788
- Come on.
- Say, man, you got everything?

1404
01:50:47,915 --> 01:50:49,874
Yeah, grab that bag.

1405
01:50:52,173 --> 01:50:54,631
This is a bitch.

1406
01:50:54,761 --> 01:50:58,132
This is it, man.
This is it.

1407
01:50:58,267 --> 01:51:00,226
All we got to do, boy,
is make it to Mexico.

1408
01:51:00,354 --> 01:51:02,895
We'll be fine.
We'll get us a villa, see?

1409
01:51:03,026 --> 01:51:05,697
And then, and buy a boat
and sail all around the gulf.

1410
01:51:05,781 --> 01:51:08,784
Everything will be fine.
We just gotta get the fuck outta here.

1411
01:51:08,912 --> 01:51:11,155
Yeah, maybe I can send
for Sarah once we get down there.

1412
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:14,246
Well, anything's possible.
Come on.

1413
01:51:14,379 --> 01:51:16,873
Wait a minute.
Run, Anthony! Hyah!

1414
01:51:16,968 --> 01:51:20,421
Y'all get back!
Get away right there! Get off me!

1415
01:51:22,101 --> 01:51:24,560
Shit!

1416
01:51:24,648 --> 01:51:28,268
- You pity fool, you pity fool
- Fuck!

1417
01:51:28,362 --> 01:51:31,319
You better have some sympathy

1418
01:51:31,452 --> 01:51:36,366
Yeah
'Cause there's educated people

1419
01:51:36,502 --> 01:51:40,205
Runnin' the lives of our society

1420
01:51:42,221 --> 01:51:43,847
Makin' up the rules

1421
01:51:44,308 --> 01:51:48,355
Mr Curtis, you have been
lawfully tried in this court...

1422
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:50,768
and found guilty on all charges.

1423
01:51:50,862 --> 01:51:54,648
Do you have anything to say on your own
behalf before I pronounce sentence?

1424
01:51:54,785 --> 01:51:56,446
Uh...

1425
01:51:56,538 --> 01:51:59,625
no, ain't nothin' I say
gonna get me out of this.

1426
01:52:01,172 --> 01:52:04,673
But things were gettin' bad
for me, and...

1427
01:52:04,803 --> 01:52:07,379
I had to do what I had to do
to s... to survive.

1428
01:52:10,688 --> 01:52:12,682
Maybe it was wrong, but l...

1429
01:52:12,818 --> 01:52:15,489
I certainly didn't mean
for anybody to be hurt.

1430
01:52:15,572 --> 01:52:18,112
Uh, Your Honour,
please consider before sentencing...

1431
01:52:18,243 --> 01:52:21,200
that my client served his country proud
in the Marine Corps.

1432
01:52:21,333 --> 01:52:23,660
As a matter of fact, he was
a member of an elite unit...

1433
01:52:23,753 --> 01:52:25,831
a sergeant,
decorated with many medals.

1434
01:52:25,924 --> 01:52:30,055
In fact, one of those medals
was the, uh, Silver Star, for valour.

1435
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:32,894
I realize that my client had
a difficult time adjusting when he...

1436
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:35,768
Excuse me, Counsel.
l, too, was a marine...

1437
01:52:35,858 --> 01:52:39,646
and I served my country proudly
in World War Il, a real war, I may add.

1438
01:52:39,782 --> 01:52:41,657
- Yes, Your Honor...
- I'm not finished yet, please.

1439
01:52:41,786 --> 01:52:45,158
I received the Purple Heart
at Guadalcanal.

1440
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:47,785
Now, this young man has obviously
forgotten some very...

1441
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:52,177
fundamental things like decency
and dedication and honor...

1442
01:52:52,304 --> 01:52:54,014
everything the corps taught us.

1443
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:56,716
He is a disgrace to everyone
that has ever put on that uniform...

1444
01:52:56,854 --> 01:53:02,149
and I will not permit you or him to use
the Vietnam War as a cop-out here.

1445
01:53:03,909 --> 01:53:07,197
Anthony Curtis, for your
participation in this crime...

1446
01:53:07,332 --> 01:53:10,999
a crime that took the lives of several
innocent people, I do hereby...

1447
01:53:11,089 --> 01:53:14,341
sentence you to the custody of the
Attorney General of the United States...

1448
01:53:14,427 --> 01:53:16,885
for a period of 15 years to life.

1449
01:53:17,015 --> 01:53:19,687
Oh, my God.

1450
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:23,854
These proceedings are concluded.
This court is adjourned.

1451
01:53:23,945 --> 01:53:27,281
"Life"? What the fuck
he mean "life"?

1452
01:53:27,368 --> 01:53:29,860
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

1453
01:53:29,955 --> 01:53:33,244
What the fuck he talkin' about, "life"?
Man, fuck you! Fuck you!

1454
01:53:33,378 --> 01:53:35,289
- Hey!
- Oh, Anthony!

1455
01:53:35,424 --> 01:53:37,548
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

1456
01:53:37,636 --> 01:53:39,464
You, remove the prisoner
from the court!

1457
01:53:39,556 --> 01:53:42,642
- You hear me?
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Restrain the prisoner!

1458
01:53:42,769 --> 01:53:46,106
Get him outta here! Let the record
show... Let the record show...

1459
01:53:46,234 --> 01:53:48,110
that a chair was thrown
at the judge.

1460
01:53:55,041 --> 01:53:56,917
Whoa, whoa

1461
01:54:03,390 --> 01:54:07,641
If you see me
walkin' down the street

1462
01:54:07,773 --> 01:54:10,645
And I start to cry

1463
01:54:10,736 --> 01:54:13,229
Each time we meet

1464
01:54:16,872 --> 01:54:18,831
Then walk on by

1465
01:54:22,507 --> 01:54:25,463
Walk on by

1466
01:54:27,725 --> 01:54:30,135
Make believe

1467
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:33,898
That you don't see the tears

1468
01:54:35,196 --> 01:54:37,986
You just let me grieve
in private

1469
01:54:38,077 --> 01:54:41,365
'Cause each time I see you

1470
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:46,254
I just can't help myself
I think about how tight we used to be

1471
01:54:46,384 --> 01:54:50,716
I break down and cry

1472
01:54:50,808 --> 01:54:52,849
Oh, baby

1473
01:54:52,937 --> 01:54:55,643
Walk on by

1474
01:55:05,375 --> 01:55:08,463
Hmm-mmm-mmm

1475
01:55:14,392 --> 01:55:18,974
I just can't get over
losing you

1476
01:55:19,108 --> 01:55:22,730
So if I seem

1477
01:55:22,824 --> 01:55:25,447
Broken in two

1478
01:55:27,958 --> 01:55:31,661
Please walk on by

1479
01:55:33,217 --> 01:55:35,840
Walk on by

1480
01:55:38,268 --> 01:55:40,808
Foolish pride

1481
01:55:40,939 --> 01:55:44,228
Is all that I have left

1482
01:55:44,362 --> 01:55:47,318
So let me hide

1483
01:55:47,409 --> 01:55:52,075
The tears and the sadness
you gave me

1484
01:55:52,210 --> 01:55:54,085
You put the hurt on me

1485
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:56,089
You socked it to me, mama

1486
01:55:56,217 --> 01:56:01,096
When you said goodbye

1487
01:56:02,687 --> 01:56:06,141
So, please, walk on by

1488
01:56:08,113 --> 01:56:11,531
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1489
01:56:14,291 --> 01:56:16,202
So do me a favour

1490
01:56:16,336 --> 01:56:19,838
And walk on by

1491
01:56:21,595 --> 01:56:23,506
So I'm beggin' you to

1492
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:26,223
Walk on by

1493
01:56:26,313 --> 01:56:28,056
Oh, yeah

1494
01:56:28,191 --> 01:56:31,110
And make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1495
01:56:33,116 --> 01:56:35,157
So I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you

1496
01:56:35,286 --> 01:56:37,577
To walk on by

1497
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:43,458
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

1498
01:56:46,432 --> 01:56:48,307
Oh

1499
01:56:48,435 --> 01:56:50,762
There's no dust in my eye

1500
01:56:50,898 --> 01:56:52,892
Oh, no

1501
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:56,655
Smoke ain't makin' me cry

1502
01:56:56,784 --> 01:56:59,455
No, no, no

1503
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:02,619
It's the hurt
you put on me, yeah

1504
01:57:04,631 --> 01:57:07,468
I don't want you
to see this man cry

1505
01:57:09,556 --> 01:57:11,800
Where is the love

1506
01:57:11,893 --> 01:57:14,386
Where is the love

1507
01:57:14,524 --> 01:57:16,933
Where is the love

1508
01:57:17,028 --> 01:57:19,485
Where is the love

1509
01:57:19,574 --> 01:57:22,114
Where is the love

1510
01:57:22,203 --> 01:57:24,495
Where is the love

1511
01:57:24,625 --> 01:57:26,869
Where is the love

1512
01:57:27,004 --> 01:57:29,331
Ooh, yeah, yeah

1513
01:57:29,467 --> 01:57:32,339
Where is the love

1514
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:35,054
You said you'd give to me

1515
01:57:35,185 --> 01:57:37,678
Soon as you were free

1516
01:57:37,773 --> 01:57:42,070
Will it ever be

1517
01:57:42,197 --> 01:57:47,197
Where is the love

1518
01:57:48,919 --> 01:57:53,714
You told me that you
didn't love him

1519
01:57:53,802 --> 01:57:58,717
And you were gonna say goodbye

1520
01:57:58,853 --> 01:58:03,898
But if you really
didn't mean it

1521
01:58:03,987 --> 01:58:09,745
Why did you have to lie

1522
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:12,751
Where is the love

1523
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:15,590
You said was mine
all mine

1524
01:58:15,716 --> 01:58:18,256
Till the end of time

1525
01:58:18,345 --> 01:58:22,393
Was it just a lie

1526
01:58:22,478 --> 01:58:27,275
Where is the love

1527
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:34,113
If you had had a sudden
change of heart

1528
01:58:34,207 --> 01:58:39,170
I wish that you
would tell me so

1529
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:44,179
Don't leave me hangin'
on these promises

1530
01:58:44,309 --> 01:58:50,102
You've gotta let me know

1531
01:58:50,194 --> 01:58:52,769
Oh-ohh

1532
01:58:52,865 --> 01:58:55,442
Do-do do-do

1533
01:58:55,537 --> 01:58:57,911
Do-do do-do

1534
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,749
Do-do do-do-do
