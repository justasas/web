You never know.

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,236
You know, my father and I
haven't spoken in three years.

312
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,273
When my brother called me and said
that my father had a heart attack...

313
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,915
and that he locked himself
in the bathroom,

314
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,838
all the way going over there,
I was thinking of...

315
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,758
how I was gonna tell him
what a bastard he was.

316
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,795
When I got there
and we put him up on the bed,

317
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,040
and I thought of all the other things
that I wanted to say to him...

318
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,077
Well, right now I'm more worried
about my mother than anything.

319
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,909
Go home. Take her home.
Get some rest.

320
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,589
- You're not gonna
find anything out now.
- That's what I told her.

321
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,269
If she could just see him for a second,
then I know she'd let me take her home.

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,311

468
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,354
A long time ago,
when I was your age, boy. Never again.

469

- Once. On a baby.
<i>- [Griss] Oh, babies.</i>

482
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,312
Yeah, that was my brother's problem.
That's why he's passed out inside.

00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,630
who keeps mumbling and poking himself
in the eye whenever he talks to me?

494
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,069
He's working a double shift.

495
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,870
Well, my father's in there.
He's in a coma.

496

My mother,
she's... she's going crazy.

497
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,396
It's like, uh,
she's in a trance.

498
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,432
She should go home.

499
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,836

502

It wasn't him. It wasn't my husband.

Mrs. Burke, they'll take care of him.
You should go home now.

That includes the shift where you

00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,599
Get the hell out of my way.

620
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,517
Okay, what happened?

621
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,916
- Please tell me he's gonna be all right.
- No, he dead.

622
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,679
- You buggin'. We just signed
our first record deal.
- Look, he dead, son.

623
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,677
Ain't nothing we can do about it.
Come on, Frank. That's it.

624
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,792
<i>- [Woman] What do you mean he's dead?</i>
- [Quietly] He's not dead.

625
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,354
It's a heroin overdose.
Let's break out the Narcan.

626
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,156
He's dead, unless you folks wanna stop
bullshitting me and tell it straight.

627
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,158
Then, the good Lord willing,
we'll try and bring him back.

628
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,237
<i>He broke up</i>
<i>with his old lady.</i>

629
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,954
- We didn't break up.
We were just seeing other people.
- Oh, she broke his heart.

630
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,152
<i>- Shut up, arsehole! Nobody asked you!</i>
- Was I talking to you?

631
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,396
Dick, shut up!

632
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,317
I'm still waiting
and this young man here is still dead.

633
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,989
<i>- You wanna leave here</i>
<i>in a body bag too?</i>
<i>- You'll end up like him, dick!</i>

634
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,159
<i>- Shut up!</i>
- He's been snorting
that Red Death stuff.

635
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,352
It's been going on
for, like, four days now.

636
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,315
I rebuke the spirit of drugs
in the name of Jesus. What's his name?

637
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,396
<i>- I.B. Bangin'.</i>
- What you mean I.B. Bangin'?

638
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,556
- I.B. Bangin'.
- What the hell kind of name
is I.B. Bangin'?

639
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,557
<i>- I don't know his real name.</i>
- It's Frederick Smith.

640
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,477
<i>- [Marcus] Okay, Freddy...</i>
- It's Frederick.

641
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,797
Okay, I.B. Bangin', we're gonna
bring you back from the dead.

642
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,878
<i>Now, I want everybody here to grab</i>
<i>the hand of the person next to you.</i>

643
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,797
Come on now.
We ain't got much time.

644
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,150
<i>And look up</i>
<i>towards the heavens.</i>

645
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,114
<i>Dear Lord,</i>
<i>here I am again...</i>

646
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,313
asking one more chance
for a sinner.

647
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,956
Please, Lord, bring back
I.B. Bangin', Lord.

648
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,675
You have the power, Jesus.
You have the might.

649
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,554
You have the super light
to spare this worthless man.

650
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,473
<i>- My God! Frederick!</i>
- Rise up, I.B. Bangin'...

651
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,114
and start your life anew!

652
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,037
Oh, thank You, Lord.

653
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,072
- What happened?
- You fucking died, you stupid bastard.

654
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,634
- I warned you.
- Damn, you guys are good.
<i>- [Marcus] Not us.</i>

655
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,151
The first step is Love.
The second is Mercy.

656
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,879
That guy I brought in yesterday,
post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

657
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,833
Burke? You're not gonna believe it.
He's showing cognitive signs.

658
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,316
It started with spontaneous respiration.
Now he's fighting to pull out the tube.

659
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,352
He had to be sedated. He's in CAT scan.
There's no room in I.C.U.

660
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,277
- What do you think?
<i>- Who knows?</i>

661
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,075
<i>It's all lower brain stem</i>
<i>activity at this point.</i>
<i>The heart refuses to stabilize.</i>

662
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,954
You know, he coded 11 times
since he got here.

663
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,877
<i>But the guy's a fighter.</i>

664
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,831
<i>Every time the Valium wears off,</i>
<i>he starts yanking on the restraints.</i>

665
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,712
The family know?

666
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,956
<i>I wanted to bring them in</i>
<i>to see if he'd respond to voices.</i>

667
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,877
But there was no one
in the waiting room.

668
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,797
This guy's daughter
was in my face all night.

669
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,717
Finally, I got something
positive to tell her, she's gone.

670
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,515
You put poison in your veins,
and now that you're breathing again,

671
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,519
you can't wait to say
"Thank you very much"
and get back out to poison shopping.

672
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,200
Well, since we saved your life,
could you do us a favor...

673
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,117
<i>and stop breathing</i>
<i>in another city next time?</i>

674
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,037
I ever tell you
about that time years ago...

675
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,470
I was on this ledge uptown
trying to pull this damn psycho inside?

676
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,388
You mean where the guy jumped
and you almost fell?
No, you never told me <i>that</i> story.

677
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,317
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
<i>No, you never listened.</i>

678
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,355
There I was.
I put everything I had into saving
this dumb-ass, low-life suicidal...

679
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,836
that when he went down,
it was like I wanted to go with him.

680
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,757
<i>That happened once in Ireland.</i>

681
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,793
This girl jumped off the cliffs
of Moher and the wind blew her back up.

682
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,595
- The wind blew her back up?
- Yeah, the wind.

683
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,154
- No, that was Jesus, son.
- It was also the wind.

684
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,475
<i>The wind, my black ass.</i>
<i>That was Jesus.</i>

685
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,352
<i>Don't tell me</i>
<i>about the Good Book.</i>

686
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,074
<i>I'll preach heaven and beat the hell</i>
<i>out of you. Don't tell me that now.</i>

687
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,077
I was going, son.

688
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,796
But if someone up on high... Thank You,
Jesus... hadn't have pulled me in...

689
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,876
<i>Would you turn left here?</i>
<i>I wanna make a stop.</i>

690
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,438
<i>The point is, everybody go through a</i>
<i>stretch where folks gonna die on you.</i>

691
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,710
Just don't meditate on it.

692
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,596
<i># I say open up the window #</i>

693
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,359
I'll be right back.

694
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,789
<i># And let me breathe #</i>

695
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,638
<i># I say open the window #</i>

696
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,838
<i>- # And let me breathe #</i>
- Hello. It's Frank Pierce
from the ambulance last night.

697
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,996
I brought your father
into the hospital.

698
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,032
<i>- I just learned some news.</i>
<i>- [Mary] I'll be right down.</i>

699
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,316
<i># I cried for ya #</i>

700
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,837
He's better, isn't he?

701
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,235
<i>Well, the doctor says</i>
<i>he's showing some movement.</i>

702
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,716
I mean, it's still early. It might mean
nothing, but I thought you'd wanna know.

703
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,311
<i>- # I cried for ya ##</i>
- Yeah, I knew.
I sensed it when I heard your voice.

704
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,674
You-You look so different.

705
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,109
Oh. [Laughing]
It's awful, isn't it?

706
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,674
It's like <i>Night</i>
<i>of the Living Cheerleaders.</i>

707
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,031
No, I think it looks good.

708
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,596
Ah, I was going nuts in that waiting
room. I came back to check on my mom.

709
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,792
<i>- How is she?</i>
- She's sleeping.

710
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,753
Sleeping.

711
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,279
I was just gonna get some food.
Pizza. I thought maybe we...

712
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,234
You can't kill my father that easy.
He's a real fighter, like with me.

713
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,079
He hasn't talked to me in three years.
But it's okay.

714
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,794
Sometimes you just have
to put things behind you.

715
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,753
I gotta be getting back.
Hey. Hey!

716
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,555
It'll be tough to get a taxi here.
We can give you a ride if you like.

717
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,511
Okay.

718
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,077
<i>Who that?</i>

719
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,555
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest
I brought in last night.

720
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,309
I told her we'd give her a ride
back to Misery. Her father's
showing signs of improving.

721
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,638
Oh, Frank, you got it bad, son.
So much worse than what I thought.

722
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,718
- I'm hungry too. We gotta get
something to eat after this.
- God, help us. He's hungry.

723
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,916
<i># These are the days #</i>

724
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,635
<i># You might fill with laughter #</i>

725
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,558
<i># Until you break #</i>

726
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,959
<i># These days you might</i>

727
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,278
<i># Make its way</i>

728
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,470
<i># And when you do #</i>

729
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,398
<i># You'll know how it was</i>
<i>meant to be #</i>

730
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,069
<i># See the signs</i>

731
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,997
<i># It's true #</i>

732
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,839
<i># You'll know how it was</i>

733
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,350
<i># Hear the signs</i>

734
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,311
<i># To you #</i>

735
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,317
<i># To you ##</i>

736
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,950
Dad?

737
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,833
Can you hear me?

738
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,791
It's Mary.

739
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,472
Squeeze my hand if
you can hear me, Dad.

740
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,273
<i>- [Woman Screams]</i>
- He squeezed my hand.

741
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,630
He's moving, Doctor.
He grabbed my hand.

742
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,399
Come on, Dad. Show 'em.
Come on. See? See?

743
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,592
<i>I'll be damned. It's movement.</i>
<i>Just not sure how voluntary it is.</i>

744
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,234
<i>[Mary]</i>
<i>No, he heard me.</i>

745
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,079
<i>Come on, Dad. Yeah.</i>

746
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,709
Oh! Nurse Crupp.

747
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,753
<i>Nurse Crupp!</i>
<i>Ten milligrams of Valium!</i>

748
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,838
<i>- Get over here.</i>
<i>- [Beeping]</i>

749
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,599
<i>- Where's that Valium?</i>
- Why don't we step out
for a little while,

750
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,517
- wait till this passes.
<i>- Make sure he's breathing.</i>

751
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,517
<i>[Beeping Continues]</i>

752
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,552
He wants
to pull that tube out.

753
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,672
It's pretty painful.
That's why they keep him sedated.

754
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,189
- But it's a good sign.
- Are you sure?

755
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,276
I know my father
would hate being tied down.

756
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,356
He wouldn't even go
to the dentist.

757
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,119
That's how it's done.

758
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,750
You have to keep the body going
until the brain and the heart...

759
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,677
recover enough
to go on their own.

760
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,234
He's better though, right?

761
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,397
He's better.

762
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,076
I'm sorry.
It's just...

763
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,509
It's important to me.
I mean, a week ago...

764
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,837
I was wishing he was dead.

765
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,872
And now, I wanna hear
his voice just once more.

766
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,956
- You know what I mean?
<i>- [Door Swings Open]</i>

767
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,150
<i>[Marcus]</i>
<i>Went over to Ray's and got this.</i>

768
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,431
Must be a place reserved in hell
for somebody who charges $1.50 a slice.

769
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,357
Anything comes up,
I'll call you.

770
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,040
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Marcus.

771
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,194
Oh, thank...
I'm not really hungry.

772
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,353
You know, my father's
a really wonderful man.

773
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,755
There was nobody
