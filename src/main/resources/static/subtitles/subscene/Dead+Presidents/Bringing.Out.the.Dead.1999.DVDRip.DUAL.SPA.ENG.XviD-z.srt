1
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,550
<i>The night started out with a bang.</i>

2
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,195
<i>A gunshot to the chest</i>
<i>on a drug deal gone bad.</i>

3
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,312
<i>All the elements were in place</i>
<i>for a long weekend...</i>

4
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,318
<i>heat, humidity, moonlight.</i>

5
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,271
<i>I was good at my job.</i>

6
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,552
<i>There were periods when my hands moved</i>
<i>with a speed and skill beyond me.</i>

7
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,558
<i>But in the last year,</i>
<i>I started to lose that control.</i>

8
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,910
<i>Things had turned bad.</i>

9
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,474
<i>I hadn't saved anyone in months.</i>

10
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,195
<i>I just needed a few slow nights,</i>
<i>followed by a couple of days off.</i>

11
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,197
<i>- Ladder Four.</i>
- We're there.

12
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,916
<i>Respond to a 10-22.</i>
<i>Four-flight residential. 417 West 32.</i>

13
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,077
<i>77-David at 177 West 24.</i>

14
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,919
<i>There's a woman who says a roach</i>
<i>crawled in her ear. Can't get it out.</i>

15
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,837
<i>Says she's going</i>
<i>into cardiac arrest.</i>

16
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,838
<i>63-Boy, men's room, Grand Central.</i>
<i>Man set his pants on fire.</i>

17
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,190
<i>- Bad burns.</i>
- Move back.
- Which apartment?

18
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,993
- 5-A.
- Oh, Jesus, it's Mr. Burke.

19
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,869
<i>Why is it always the top floor?</i>

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,797
<i>Goddam.</i>

21
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,912
<i>No! No!</i>

22
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,313
<i>No! No!</i>

23
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,831
<i>No! No!</i>

24
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,075
Oh, God, they're here.

25
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,316
Shh, shh. Over there.

26
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,874
Mary, it's two hands.
It's my dad.

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,594
We were just watching TV,
and he was sort of punching his chest...

28
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,632
- Step outside.
- Next thing,
he locks himself in the bathroom.

29
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,557
So I told him I was gonna
call you guys, and he said not to.

30
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,796
- How long ago did he stop breathing?
- I don't know. Ten minutes.

31
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,071
Twenty. A woman on the phone
tried to tell us how to do C.P.R.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,395
- Could you do something?
- We'll do what we can.

33
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,034
<i>He was cryin'.</i>
<i>I never heard him cryin' before.</i>

34
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,109
I need you to squeeze this
once every three seconds.

35
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,268
Clear! Clear!

36
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,109
- Ma'am, I need you to step back.
- Clear! Clear!

37
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,629
No more. Please don't.

38
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,479
- Clear! Clear!
- Ma'am, step back.

39
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,035
Daddy.

40
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,993
<i>In the last year,</i>
<i>I'd come to believe in such things...</i>

41
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,352
<i>as spirits leaving the body</i>
<i>and not wanting to be put back.</i>

42
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,598
<i>Spirits angry at the awkward places</i>
<i>death had left them.</i>

43
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,111
<i>I understood how crazy it was</i>
<i>to think this way.</i>

44
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,357
<i>But I was convinced</i>
<i>that if I turned around,</i>

45
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,755
<i>I'd see old man Burke...</i>

46
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,348
<i>standing at the window,</i>

47
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,311
<i>watching,</i>

48
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,670
<i>waiting for us to finish.</i>

49
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,116
I'll take over.
Call E.R. and ask for an 83.

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,831
Sorry.

51
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,715
Do you have any music?

52
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,752
- What?
<i>- Music.</i>

53
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,350
<i>I think it helps if you play</i>
<i>something he liked.</i>

54
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,117
John.

55
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,151
Play the Sinatra.

56
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,158
- What?
- Play the Sinatra.

57
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,316
What is it, Johnny?

58
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,472
Okay, Frank, you can call it. 83.

59
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,957
- No, we can't. He's got a pulse.
<i>- No shit?</i>

60
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,436
Is he gonna be all right?

61
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,394
His heart's beating.
Have 'em bring up a board.

62
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,714
No, no. No. No.

63
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,593
Help your family.
Ride with your mother and brother.

64
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,269
Help your family.
They need you more. Help yourself.

65
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,239
For the family.

66
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,273
<i>I had to concentrate</i>
<i>to keep my mind from wandering off...</i>

67
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,197
<i>on these short trips.</i>

68
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,595
<i>It was the neighborhood</i>
<i>I grew up in...</i>

69
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,632
<i>and where I'd worked most</i>
<i>as a paramedic.</i>

70
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,912
<i>And it held more ghosts</i>
<i>per square foot than any other.</i>

71
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,549
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

72
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,911
<i>Hey, partner.</i>
<i>Your man doesn't look well.</i>
<i>They not gonna appreciate you inside.</i>

73
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,952
- Nobody loves me, Griss.
- Hey, Griss just tellin' you
things are backing up.

74
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,036
Griss, let us in.

75
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,071
Whatever you say.

76
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,634
Oh, my foot!

77
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,957
Don't even slow down.
Just keep on moving.

78
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,039
<i>Sir, you say you've been snorting</i>
<i>cocaine for three days...</i>

79
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,993
and now you feel as if your heart
is beating too fast...

80
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,838
and you would like
for us to help you.

81
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,838
To tell you the truth,
I don't see why we should.

82
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,428
Correct me if I am wrong here,
if I'm mistaken.

83
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,994
Did we sell you the cocaine?
Did we push it up your nose?

84
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,396
- Oh, come on.
- For Christ sakes,
can I please get a cup of water?

85
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,796
- Shut up, goddam civilian!
- All I want is a cup of water!

86
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,036
<i>Oh, no. No, no,</i>
<i>no, no, no, guys.</i>

87
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,232
We're on diversion here.
We're not accepting any more patients.

88
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,432
<i>The dispatcher should've let you</i>
<i>know that, Frank. I cannot do it. No.</i>

89
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,278
We picked him up at 49th and 10th.
You're the closest.

90
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,197
Where do you want me to put him?
You tell me.

91
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,278
He wanted to come here. He said that
the nurses at Misery were the best.

92
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,678
- All I want is a cup of water!
- All right, fine.
I'll kick someone out of bed three.

93
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,439
Excuse me.
You're a kind man, I can see that.

94
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,518
A man like you's not gonna deny a poor,
sick, dying, helpless man...

95
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,359
- a small cup of water.
- I can't.
I have to stay with my patient.

96
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,596
Will you shut the fuck up?

97
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,952
Goddam it. What the hell are you doing
to me? We're all backed up in here.

98
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,277
Jesus Christ, look at this guy.
Looks like he needs the works.
What's wrong with him?

99
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,631
- You should know. You pronounced him.
- You told me he was dead.

100
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,557
- Flatline.
- He got better.

101
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,750
I hate pronouncing
people dead over the phone.

102
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,953
Yeah. Better, huh? They're fixed
and dilated. This guy's plant food.

103
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,516
Hey, we stole a stretcher from X ray, so
put him in three next to the overdose.

104
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,279
All right, look. He's our lowest
priority now. He shouldn't even be here.

105
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,550
<i>All this technology.</i>
<i>What a waste.</i>

106
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,274
<i>Leave that dope alone.</i>
<i>The doc'll be out in a minute.</i>

107
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,994
- Sir, is there some way we could
find out what's going on?
- Please, folks, step back.

108
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,954
Please, folks, step back.
I've already told you two to step back.

109
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,913
- Mister...
- Now, look, don't make me
take off my sunglasses.

110
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,999
First-time heart attack, age 45. He
should've gone to C.C.U. ten hours ago.

111
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,236
<i>We got three bodies up there</i>
<i>just like the one you brought in.</i>

112
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,591
Over there, two AIDS patients.
One is 12 and filling up with fluids.

113
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,597
<i>Mother won't sign</i>
<i>the "Do Not Resuscitate."</i>

114
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,314
<i>Mercy killing doesn't</i>
<i>translate well in Spanish.</i>

115
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,795
It's a sin
to have to tube that kid.

116
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,878
<i>We got three more O.D.s from this new</i>
<i>killerjunk they're calling Red Death.</i>

117
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,150
<i>What's in it?</i>

118
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,555
It's a mix of heroin and I don't know
what else. An amino acid, maybe.

119
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,591
<i>This stuff is so strong,</i>
<i>they're drinking it with grain alcohol.</i>

120
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,790
<i>You need ten times</i>
<i>the usual amount of Narcan.</i>

121
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,956
And when they wake up, watch out
'cause they're liable to go nuts on you.

122
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,073
- He one of 'em?
<i>- No, that's Noel.</i>
<i>He used to be a regular off and on.</i>

123
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,997
I haven't seen him for a while.
He seized and almost coded.

124
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,917
I gave him
a hypertonic solution.

125
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,837
He drank so much
his kidneys were taking out salt.

126
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,838
- That's one for the textbooks.
- Doc, you're the greatest.

127
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,077
- You gotta help me.
- Can you give this guy a drink of water?

128
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,634
Noel, I am helping you. You drink
any more water, you could die!

129
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,671
<i>Hazmat, three's coding.</i>
<i>We got a flatline here.</i>

130
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,032
<i>Start C.P.R. Milagros, get me an epi.</i>
<i>Odette, wake up Dr. Starks.</i>

131
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,913
<i>Tell him we're gonna need him stat.</i>
<i>400 joules. Clear!</i>

132
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,315
You want water?
I'll give you water.

133
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
- What a pain in the ass.
Just get out of here.
<i>- 600 joules.</i>

134
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,237
<i>- Clear!</i>
<i>- So you get drunk</i>
<i>every day and you fall down.</i>

135
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,830
<i>Well, why should we help you?</i>
<i>You’re just gonna get drunk</i>
<i>tomorrow, fall down again.</i>

136
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,757
<i>Griss, this man</i>
<i>wants to leave.</i>

137
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,109
- Thank you.
- I know him. That's Noel.

138
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,754
You better step outside.
Quickly.

139
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,755
- Get...
- Fuck!

140
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,350
Noel? Noel.

141
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,629
It's... It's me.
It's Mary Burke from 49th Street.

142
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,955
Oh, Mary.

143
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,437
Oh, Mary, I'm so thirsty. They won't
give me any water to drink in there.

144
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,676
- Please.
- I'll get you some.

145
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,558
I wouldn't do that.

146
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,954
The doctor seems to think he's suffering
from some rare disorder.

147
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,750
He's had a rough life.
He grew up on our street.

148
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,950
He's a little crazy from it,
but that's no excuse...

149
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,516
<i>for not giving somebody</i>
<i>a lousy cup of water.</i>

150
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,117
Here.

151
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,039
My father's dying, Noel.

152
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,317
Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary.

153
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,633
<i>Oh.</i>

154
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,191
<i>Chinese closes in five minutes.</i>

155
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,950
Beef lo mein. Been on my mind
since I awoke. What do you think?

156
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,197
I think the moment that food
hits your mouth, we'll get a run.

157
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,232
Turn here. You missed it.
Chink's on 11th.

158
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,516
Oh, finally. Where you been?

159
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,678
<i>Hey, ambulance man,</i>
<i>what you looking at?</i>

160
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,875
Yeah, pretty soon
you'll be coming for me.

161
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,230
Do you think he'll come for me?

162
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,909
Pretty soon
you'll be coming for me.

163
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,713
Boy, some partner you are, Frank.
I could've walked there faster.

164
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,719
I'm starving, and you stop to talk
to hookers. You're making me nuts.

165
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,593
Is that what you're trying to do?
Drag me down to Nutsville with you?

166
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,517
- Oh, no!
- What?

167
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,518
I just remembered. I'm so stupid.
I had beef lo mein last night.

168
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,200
I can't eat the same thing
two nights in a row.

169
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,437
It's almost 2:00. What the hell am
I gonna do? What are you getting?

170
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,279
- I'm not hungry.
- Yeah, you don't eat food.

171
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,470
I eat.

172
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,309
Larry, I eat.
Just haven't had coffee yet.

173
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,591
Only coffee and whisky.
Lucky you ain't dead with that diet.

174
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,676
I got it.

175
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,270
Half fried chicken
and fries. Let's go.

176
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,116
<i>Rose's ghost was getting closer.</i>

177
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,553
<i>It had been six months since I lost her.</i>
<i>A homeless girl,</i>

178
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,990
<i>asthmatic, 18 years old.</i>

179
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,156
<i>I used to block</i>
<i>the bad calls out.</i>

180
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,637
<i>I used to forget,</i>
<i>but she wouldn't let go.</i>

181
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,911
<i>And now she'd come</i>
<i>to bear witness for all of them,</i>

182
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,474
<i>all that had been lost.</i>

183
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,034
<i>These spirits</i>
<i>were part of the job.</i>

184
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,835
<i>It was impossible to pass a building</i>
<i>that didn't hold a ghost of something.</i>

185
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,555
<i>The eyes of a corpse.</i>
<i>The screams of a loved one.</i>

186
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,752
<i>All bodies leave their mark.</i>

187
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,589
<i>You cannot be near the newly dead</i>
<i>without feeling it.</i>

188
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,957
<i>I could handle that.</i>

189
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,674
<i>What haunted me now</i>
<i>was more savage.</i>

190
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,677
<i>Spirits born half-finished.</i>

191
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,872
<i>Homicides.</i>
<i>Suicides. Overdoses.</i>

192
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,310
<i>Accusing me of being there,</i>
<i>witnessing a humiliation,</i>

193
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,715
<i>which they</i>
<i>could never forgive.</i>

194
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,109
Turn it off.

195
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,550
- What?
- You know what. The radio.

196
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,831
That's not the police band. It's your
fire department scanner in your bag.

197
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,076
- Oh.
Ladder Four, respond to a 10-22.

198
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,634
<i>Six-flight residential.</i>
<i>534 West 32.</i>

199
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,435
- Let's do it.
It might be a good one.
- There are no good fires.

200
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,394
People die in fires. People get burned
up in fires. People can't breathe.

201
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,273
That's what we're here for.
Let's go.

202
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,198
- 63...
- Don't push it, Larry.

203
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,550
- Oh, you're burned out, man.
You're scorched.
- Not yet, Larry.

204
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,513
I'm still burning. If you get
any closer, I'm gonna put a burn on you.

205
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,589
<i>6-3 Zebra. 6-3 Zebra.</i>
<i>Zebra three, I need you.</i>

206
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,676
- You see? He's giving it to us anyway.
<i>- Zebra, are you there?</i>

207
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,952
<i>- I'm holding</i>
<i>an unconscious at 9th and 41st.</i>
<i>- No, no, no!</i>

208
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,072
<i>3:00 in the morning.</i>
<i>That can only mean one thing.</i>

209
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,156
- Mr. Oh.
- Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.

210
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,236
Answer the radio, Zebra.
You know it's that time.

211
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,591
Four times this week I've had him.
Aren't there any other units out there?

212
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,154
- Zebra, are you there?
<i>- Don't answer it.</i>
<i>They'll get somebody else.</i>

213
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,829
63-Zebra, answer me now, or I'm sending
a captain to your location.

214
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,953
Frank,
when I say don't answer it, that means
answer it. You could do me that favor.

215
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,911
<i>- 6-3 Zebra.</i>
<i>- Yes, Zebra, you'll be driving...</i>

216
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,156
<i>to the man who needs no introduction.</i>

217
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,158
<i>Chronic caller of the year, three</i>
<i>straight and shooting for number four,</i>

218
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,919
<i>the duke of drunk,</i>
<i>the king of stink,</i>

219
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,077
<i>- our most frequent flyer, Mr. Oh.</i>
- 10-4.

220
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,634
<i>Don't do it.</i>
<i>Not this time...</i>

221
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,877
<i>Relax. It's a street job.</i>
<i>It's easy except for the smell.</i>

222
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,798
We just throw him in the back,
zip over to Mercy.

223
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,708
No blood, no dying. That's how
I look at it. He's just a drunk.

224
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,637
It's not our job
to taxi drunks around.

225
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,228
Yeah, but they're just
gonna keep calling.

226
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,511
Someone's gonna have a cardiac,
and the only medics will
be taking care of Mr. Oh.

227
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,155
<i>He's bad, mister.</i>
<i>He ain't eaten nothing all day.</i>

228
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,077
<i>And he's seizing</i>
<i>and throwing up.</i>

229
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,395
- So, what's different about him today?
- He says his feet hurt.

230
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,196
- Oh, why didn't you say so?
<i>- I can't find a pulse,</i>
<i>but he's still breathing.</i>

231
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,629
Well, it looks like we're just in time.
Step aside, sir.

232
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,399
- He's drunk.
<i>- He's sick. You gotta help him.</i>

233
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,317
He's fine.
He can walk to the hospital.

234
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,715
Walk? Are you crazy?
He's in the wheelchair.

235
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,274
Oh, don't give me that.
He walks better than I do.

236
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,234
Oh! Oh! That's right, Mr. Oh.

237
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,352
Come on, buddy. Your limo's here.

238
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,233
- Get better.
- Good luck, old buddy.

239
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,435
Oh!

240
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,632
- Faster! Come on, Frank. Faster!
<i>- Faster?</i>

241
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,832
You want faster?

242
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,837
Oh, no.
Take that stinky-ass motherfucking
bug-ridden skell out of my face!

243
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,837
Johnny, welcome back.
Good to see ya.

244
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,076
And my conscience simply
will not allow that.

245
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,350
Griss, this gentleman
would like to leave.

246
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,040
Oh! He looks so pale.

247
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,311
Hey, you getting enough to eat?
You getting your fiber?

248
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,510
Wasted. That's my diagnosis.
He's shit-faced.

249
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,950
He just needs a bath and some food.
Let's take him in back.

250
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,719
<i>- Get a stretcher.</i>
- She's nuts. That's why he comes here.

251
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,990
- She encourages him.
- Don't you dare.
This is not a homeless shelter.

252
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,395
- He's gonna have to wait in the lobby.
- No way, man.

253
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,750
Not even in the corner.
Griss cannot abide the funk tonight.

254
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,440
Senor. Senor.

255
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,668
My first cigarette
in over a year.

256
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,234
First is always the best.

257
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,839
The doctor doesn't think
my father will make it.

258
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,793
Said he was dead for too long.

259
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,434
After six minutes,
the brain starts to die,

260
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,199
and after that,

261
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,073
just close the door.

262
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,760
You never know.

263
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,236
You know, my father and I
haven't spoken in three years.

264
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,273
When my brother called me and said
that my father had a heart attack...

265
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,915
and that he locked himself
in the bathroom,

266
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,838
all the way going over there,
I was thinking of...

267
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,758
how I was gonna tell him
what a bastard he was.

268
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,795
When I got there
and we put him up on the bed,

269
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,040
and I thought of all the other things
that I wanted to say to him...

270
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,077
Well, right now I'm more worried
about my mother than anything.

271
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,909
Go home. Take her home.
Get some rest.

272
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,589
- You're not gonna
find anything out now.
- That's what I told her.

273
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,269
If she could just see him for a second,
then I know she'd let me take her home.

274
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,311
Thanks for the light.

275
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,159
Here's your dinner.
I wheel, you heal.

276
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,318
<i>6-2 David, at 38th and 2,</i>
<i>you'll find a three-car accident.</i>

277
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,396
<i>Two taxis and a taxi.</i>

278
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,751
<i>6- 2 Henry, 6-2 Henry.</i>
<i>487 West 22.</i>

279
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,519
<i>Report of a very bad smell.</i>
<i>No further information.</i>

280
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,471
Larry, swing over to 10th. We're gonna
have to run one of these calls.

281
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,875
Relax, will ya?

282
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,476
<i>The biggest problem with not driving...</i>

283
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,036
<i>is that whenever there's a patient</i>
<i>in the back, you're also in the back.</i>

284
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,516
<i>The door's closed. You're trapped.</i>

285
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,316
<i>5:00 or 6:00 in the morning is always</i>
<i>the worst time for me. Just before dawn.</i>

286
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,237
<i>Just when you've been</i>
<i>lulled into thinking...</i>

287
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,591
<i>it might be safe to close</i>
<i>your eyes for one minute.</i>

288
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,109
<i>That's when</i>
<i>I first found Rose.</i>

289
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,392
<i>She was on the sidewalk,</i>
<i>not breathing.</i>

290
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,633
I'm not feeling very well, Larry.

291
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,638
Let's say we go back
to the hospital, call it a night.

292
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,958
You got no sick time, Frank. No time
of any kind. Everyone knows that.

293
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,674
Take me back.
Put me to bed. I surrender.

294
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,597
We've done
enough damage tonight.

295
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,075
You take things way
too seriously, Frank.

296
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,959
<i>You ever think</i>
<i>of doing anything else?</i>

297
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,991
<i>Sure.</i>

298
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,950
Taking my captain's
exam next year.

299
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,390
Once the kids are in school,
Louise can go back to the post office.

300
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,114
I thought, "What the hell?
I'll start my own medic service."

301
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,028
Out on the island, the volunteers
are becoming salaried municipal.

302
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,596
It's just a matter of time
and who you know.

303
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,157
Someday it's gonna be
Chief Larry calling the shots.

304
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,988
<i>I'd always had nightmares.</i>

305
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,795
<i>But now the ghosts</i>
<i>didn't wait for me to sleep.</i>

306
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,718
<i>I drank every day.</i>

307
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,115
<i>"Help others</i>
<i>and you help yourself."</i>

308
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,708
<i>That was my motto.</i>

309
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,673
<i>But I hadn't saved</i>
<i>anyone in months.</i>

310
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,553
<i>It seemed all my patients</i>
<i>were dying on me.</i>

311
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,353
<i>I'd waited,</i>
<i>sure the sickness would break.</i>

312
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,996
<i>Maybe the next call, maybe tomorrow,</i>
<i>the feeling would drop away.</i>

313
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,238
<i>More than anything else,</i>
<i>I wanted to sleep like that.</i>

314
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,511
<i>Close my eyes</i>
<i>and drift away.</i>

315
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,391
<i>Zebra. 6-3 Zebra.</i>

316
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,557
<i>Zebra.</i>

317
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,553
Zebra, answer the radio.
Come on. I got one for you.

318
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,992
<i>Pick up the radio and push the button</i>
<i>on the side and speak into the front.</i>

319
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,759
<i>Come on. Zebra?</i>

320
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,911
- Zebra.
<i>- Suicidal male bleeding,</i>

321
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,474
<i>corner of 44th and 8th.</i>

322
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,955
<i>No further information.</i>

323
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,514
10-4.

324
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,512
<i>We have a call, Chief.</i>
<i>Somebody's bleeding. 44th and 8th.</i>

325
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,428
<i>No, no. Brake! Brake!</i>
<i>It's the water. Turn around.</i>

326
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,079
<i>Come on. Kill me!</i>
<i>Push it in! Do it!</i>

327
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,557
Kill me! Huh? Come on.
Kill me. Just push it. Huh?

328
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,672
<i>I'm gonna cut</i>
<i>my throat, man.</i>

329
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,154
No, don't!
Drop the bottle.

330
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,430
- Put down the bottle.
<i>- He's crazy.</i>

331
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,394
Really? You look pretty thirsty,
Noel. You want some water?

332
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,030
See, I can't do it.
I came out of the desert.

333
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,230
Those people left me
in the sun to die.

334
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,157
You came out
of the hospital.

335
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,077
You were tied down
and hallucinating.

336
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,997
You got some bad
chemicals in your head.

337
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,873
- There's some medicine at
the hospital that'll fix that.
- No! No medicine.

338
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,912
- No medicine.
- He got ya.
<i>- Do it!</i>

339
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,158
<i>Man wants to die? I know how to kill</i>
<i>that mother. Pop, pop.</i>

340
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,193
- Oh, sh...
- Shit!

341
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,190
Noel! Noel!

342
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,710
<i>Noel!</i>
<i>Larry, call for backup.</i>

343
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,550
<i>6-3 Zebra,</i>
<i>10-85 forthwith, 44 and 8th.</i>

344
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,716
Get out of the road,
you crazy bastard!

345
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,637
Noel, you didn't
let me finish.

346
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,275
We have rules against killing people
on the street, okay? It looks bad.

347
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,153
There's a special room
at the hospital for terminating.

348
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,953
It's a nice quiet room
with a big bed.

349
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,948
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

350
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,437
Man, thank you, man.

351
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,950
Wait a minute. How?
How are you gonna kill me?

352
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,993
Well, you have a choice.
You can have pills, injection or gas.

353
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,670
- Pills. Definitely pills.
<i>- You fucking arsehole!</i>

354
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,149
Tom Wolls,
that crazy motherfucker.

355
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,840
- He used to be my partner.
- Frank.

356
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,355
This the guy you called about?
I know you.

357
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,314
- Nah, you don't know me.
You don't know me.
- Oh, yes, I do, Pedro. I do.

358
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,318
- I know you. I know him.
- I don't think so.

359
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,715
You give my friend here
any more trouble, I'll kill ya.

360
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,479
- Yeah, at the hospital.
- What?

361
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,397
At the hospital. He's gonna
kill me in the hospital.

362
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,317
Forget the hospital.
I'll kill you here.

363
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,079
This looks like a very bad man
I took in a couple of weeks ago...

364
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,794
who'd been holding two priests...
not one, two priests...

365
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,354
<i>hostage with a screwdriver,</i>
<i>and I told him...</i>

366
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,596
if he was ever caught
making trouble again,

367
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,154
- I'd kick the murdering life out of him.
- It's not worth it, Tom.

368
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,352
- He's surrendering.
- What?

369
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,914
- The war's over.
- Not mine.

370
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,112
Hey, Pedro, come here,
you little motherfucker.

371
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,037
I just want to talk to you,

372
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,390
give you a little
psychological first aid.

373
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,193
I'm gonna give you your first lesson
on how to be an American.

374
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,436
It's called
"Eatin' My Shit."

375
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,949
<i>- Come here.</i>

376
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,152
Tom, don't do it,
Tom. Tom!

377
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,077
I have to take him
to the hospital.

378
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,193
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- Get up here, motherfucker!

379
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,912
- That's enough!
<i>- Take that!</i>

380
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,271
<i>There's a double shooting three blocks</i>
<i>down. 41st and 8th, confirmed.</i>

381
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,153
We'll do that.
Larry. Larry. Larry!

382
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,750
- I'll take it. Motherfucker!
- That's enough.

383
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,350
I'll do that. I'll see you
over there, okay?

384
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,199
What happened?

385
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,112
Oh, man. Just walked up
and shot him. Not a word.

386
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,949
- Damn, that was cold.
- E.M.S. Move it.

387
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,150
Where are you hit?

388
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,431
You see this shit, man?
Niggas put a hole in me.

389
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,270
Yo, Tiger did this shit, yo.
And money right here work for Outlaw.

390
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,913
<i>- We got a gang war</i>
<i>about to start, yo.</i>
- Take a deep breath.

391
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,956
Major Tom! I'm going to Misery!
You take yours to Bellevue.

392
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,152
Okay, Frank, you take yours to heaven.
I'll take mine to hell. Let's go.

393
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,714
Get him on the board.
Let's go.

394
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,909
You're gonna feel a stick in your arm.
Don't move.

395
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,508
<i>Listen, I'm quitting, man.</i>

396
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,154
I'm going in the army
where it's safe.

397
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,475
I don't wanna die.

398
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,512
- No, I wanna die. I'm the one.
- You're not gonna die.

399
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,393
- What did you say?
- Shut up! You're going to die.
He's not. Got it?

400
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,069
<i>- Hold my hand, man.</i>
- I can't. I gotta do the other arm.

401
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,829
- Hold my hand, man.
- Hold this.

402
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,155
If you let go,
I swear I won't kill you.

403
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,073
It's all right. We're here.

404
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,475
Fuck.

405
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,034
He's not breathing.
Call a code.

406
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,390
Noel, let's go.

407
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,239
<i>Let's go!</i>

408
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,830
Fucking Christ.

409
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,396
<i>So here I am. And this junkie</i>
<i>got something jammed in his teeth.</i>

410
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,592
<i>Now, none of these junkies wanna give</i>
<i>mouth-to-mouth. It was a blow dryer.</i>

411
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,871
<i>So I pulls it out.</i>
<i>His body was cold except for his throat.</i>

412
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,310
It had been blow-dried for an hour.
Junkie had second-degree burns
of the tongue.

413
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,635
Did you ever give mouth-to-mouth?

414
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,354
A long time ago,
when I was your age, boy. Never again.

415
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,438
Chances are you end up
with a mouthful of puke. Junkie puke.

416
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,314
I'd do it if I had to.
It's part of the job.

417
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,510
<i>- What about you?</i>
- What?

418
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,631
You ever do
mouth-to-mouth before?

419
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,832
- Once. On a baby.
<i>- Oh, babies.</i>

420
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,032
Now, babies are a whole
different thing entirely.

421
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,435
<i>Did I ever tell you about the time</i>
<i>that white woman approached me?</i>

422
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,996
<i>I said, "Ma'am, I'm a true cocksman,</i>
<i>and I don't mix my seed. "</i>

423
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,032
<i>Only time you see me with a white woman</i>
<i>when I'm holdin' her for the police. "</i>

424
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,594
<i>That's the truth.</i>

425
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,071
You shouldn't smoke.

426
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,110
It's okay.
They're prescription.

427
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,754
Works better
with a little whisky.

428
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,312
Yeah, that was my brother's problem.
That's why he's passed out inside.

429
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,237
That's it!

430
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,989
I've had it!
Can't take it anymore.

431
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,310
- You got... blood on...
- I know.

432
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,388
That boy you brought in,
he's, uh, shot, wasn't he?

433
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,317
<i>Yeah.</i>

434
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,836
He's dead, huh?

435
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,791
Yes.

436
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,828
I think this place stinks.

437
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,350
- Our Lady of Misery.
<i>- It's crazy in there.</i>

438
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,277
What's the matter
with that doctor...

439
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,630
who keeps mumbling and poking himself
in the eye whenever he talks to me?

440
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,069
He's working a double shift.

441
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,870
Well, my father's in there.
He's in a coma.

442
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,673
My mother,
she's... she's going crazy.

443
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,396
It's like, uh,
she's in a trance.

444
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,432
She should go home.

445
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,836
<i>Yeah, well, I'd take her,</i>
<i>but somebody's got to stay here.</i>

446
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,195
- Did you see him?
<i>- It wasn't him.</i>

447
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,117
<i>You saw him?</i>

448
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,312
They showed me someone.
It wasn't him. It wasn't my husband.

449
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,273
Mrs. Burke, they'll take care of him.
You should go home now.

450
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,197
I should know my own husband.

451
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,117
They wouldn't let me see him.

452
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,834
Larry and I'll drop her home.
Help me get her to the ambulance.

453
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,191
Mom, they're gonna give you a ride home.
Come on. This way.

454
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,636
You want some coffee?

455
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,069
I have applesauce cake too.

456
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,272
- Right here. Right there.
- Oh.

457
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,311
Thanks.

458
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,908
I'll call you
if anything changes.

459
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,430
<i>Saving someone's</i>
<i>life is like falling in love.</i>

460
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,551
<i>The best drug in the world.</i>

461
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,673
<i>For days,</i>
<i>sometimes weeks afterwards,</i>

462
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,679
<i>you walk the street</i>
<i>making infinite whatever you see.</i>

463
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,473
<i>Once, for a few weeks,</i>
<i>I couldn't feel the earth.</i>

464
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,716
<i>Everything I touched</i>
<i>became lighter.</i>

465
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,152
<i>Horns played in my shoes.</i>
<i>Flowers fell from my pockets.</i>

466
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,748
<i>You wonder</i>
<i>if you've become immortal,</i>

467
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,872
<i>as if you've saved</i>
<i>your own life as well.</i>

468
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,468
<i>God has passed through you.</i>

469
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,637
<i>Why deny it</i>
<i>that for a moment there...</i>

470
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,197
<i>Why deny for a moment there</i>
<i>God was you?</i>

471
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,319
<i>Taking credit when things go right</i>
<i>doesn't work the other way.</i>

472
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,434
<i>When things go wrong,</i>
<i>spreading the blame is an</i>
<i>essential medic survival tool.</i>

473
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,996
<i>"The elevator broke down."</i>
<i>"The boyfriend was crazy."</i>

474
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,635
<i>"I should've called in sick."</i>
<i>"The tube wouldn't go in."</i>

475
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,436
<i>The god of hellfire is not a role</i>
<i>that anyone wants to play.</i>

476
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,872
- Good morning, Captain.
- What am I gonna do with this guy?

477
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,836
Pierce, I just got off the phone
with Borough Command.

478
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,873
Out of 12 shifts this month,
you've been late for nine, sick four.

479
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,434
That includes the shift where you
came in late, you went home early.

480
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,154
- I'm sick. That's what
I've been telling you.
<i>- You're sick?</i>

481
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,077
You're killing me,
do you know that?

482
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,670
You've got no sick time
left according to Command.
I mean, I was told to terminate.

483
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,588
It's okay. I'll just get
my things out of my locker.

484
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,599
Excuse me. It's not okay.
I-I never fired anybody in my life, man.

485
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,598
I'm sorry, Captain.
Don't take it too hard.

486
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,637
<i>Nobody tells me to fire anybody, ever.</i>

487
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,435
I told them, "Stick it right up
your big one." Pardon me.

488
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,597
<i>I said, "You wanna fire him?</i>
<i>Come on over and do it yourself."</i>

489
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,553
You know they won't do it.
It's up to you. You've gotta be strong.

490
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,389
- Be a man.
- I am a man.
You think they give these to sissies?

491
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,115
<i>Come on, kid. This is a weekend</i>
<i>of full moons. Nobody wants to work.</i>

492
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,151
<i>I mean, your partner</i>
<i>Larry's called in sick.</i>

493
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,192
Okay, Larry Veeber.
Stupid Stanley too.

494
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,869
<i>Come on. I need bodies out there.</i>
<i>I got buses that gotta run.</i>

495
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,797
I had to put Marcus on 62-Young.

496
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,912
Hey. Hey. You know he's not
supposed to work two nights in a row.

497
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,713
- You know what we're in for
with that one?
- You swore you'd fire me...

498
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,956
if I came in late again.

499
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,514
<i>- I'll fire you tomorrow.</i>

500
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,552
Even better than that,
what was I thinking about?

501
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,592
I could forward you some sick time.
How about a week?

502
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,792
A week's not gonna do it.
A week's not gonna do it.

503
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,354
- Kid, you're saying
no, it ain't gonna do it.

504
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,829
You're going out
with Marcus. Okay?

505
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,757
Duty calls you, kid.
The city needs you. Please.

506
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,633
<i>I'll front you sick time.</i>
<i>I'll make it up to you. Honest to God.</i>

507
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,639
Look at me. The next time
I see you, I'll fire you.

508
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,469
- I can bark too.
<i>- Pierce, you can do it all.</i>

509
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,716
I never said
I could bark better than you.

510
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,752
<i>Go and help... Go and help</i>
<i>the people of New York. Go ahead.</i>

511
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,440
<i>Get out there and mop them up for me.</i>
<i>Go ahead. Do your job.</i>

512
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,791
<i>- Do your job. You're the best.</i>
<i>- Put down that crack stem.</i>

513
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,952
Put down that crack stem
and drop your jug of sin,

514
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,271
your high-heeled skirts
and your stock dividends,

515
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,472
your patent leather underwear,
televised suicides,

516
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,115
<i>lap dancers in leotards</i>
<i>in delicatessens.</i>

517
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,631
<i>And the Lord said,</i>
<i>"If you can find one that</i>
<i>isn't a sinner... just one...</i>

518
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,991
<i>- then I will spare the city. "</i>
- My Lord, Mother of Man.

519
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,272
Boy, you look like hell.
What you drinking?

520
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,870
Captain almost fired me tonight.
I'm on my way out.

521
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,797
Anytime now.

522
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,878
<i>Nobody gets fired, son.</i>
<i>Look at me.</i>

523
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,072
The most they might do
is transfer you to the Bronx.

524
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,351
Boy, you look like you aged about
ten years since I rode with you last.

525
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,789
I ain't feeling so hot.

526
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,034
I've been seeing the ghosts.

527
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,671
- You mean the people we lost?
- Yeah.

528
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,189
If they got to go, got to go.
God bless 'em.

529
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,599
You ever notice people who see shit
are always crazy? Mm-hmm.

530
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,517
<i>Scientific fact.</i>

531
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,632
- I think the worst is over.
<i>- Oh, no, son.</i>

532
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,514
It can always get worse.
See, you can't change what's out there.

533
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,437
Only where
you're coming from.

534
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,994
So you got to let the good Lord...
Thank you, Jesus...

535
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,315
take over in here.

536
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,557
6-2 Young.
Let's go, 6-2 Young. Answer the radio.

537
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,433
Marcus, it's Love.
I haven't heard her in months.

538
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,950
Well, no,
she only works when I'm on.

539
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,674
I makes her wait.
Drives her crazy.

540
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,792
- It is true you and Love
went on a blind date?
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,117
- She hit you with a bottle?
- Why you gotta bring that up?

542
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,151
She loves me the way
no woman ever has.

543
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,350
6-2 Young, I don't have time
for your games.

544
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,948
<i>Now, answer me or do I have</i>
<i>to come out there myself?</i>

545
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,196
Oh, sookie, sookie.
now. Rough.

546
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,153
<i>Now, see, I usually don't do</i>
<i>calls before my coffee,</i>

547
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,272
but I think this'll
be good for you, son.

548
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,834
6-2 Young is here, baby.

549
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,235
And I'm gonna take care of you.

550
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,433
Come on, white boy.

551
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,031
'Cause Big Daddy Marcus
is alive and on arrival, baby.

552
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,833
<i>I'm not your baby, Young.</i>
<i>I'm not your mother either.</i>

553
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,158
<i>You're going to a cardiac arrest.</i>
<i>30th and 11th, north-east corner.</i>

554
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,714
<i>It's a club.</i>
<i>Take the back entrance.</i>

555
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,400
All right, 10-4, sweet mama.
You feeling better, Frank?

556
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,317
- I feel worse.
<i>- Oh, that's good, boy.</i>

557
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,637
This here is for you.

558
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,759
I hope we're not too late from you folks
holding us up here. Excuse me.

559
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,677
Right this way.

560
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,599
Get the hell out of my way.

561
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,517
Okay, what happened?

562
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,916
- Please tell me he's gonna be all right.
- No, he dead.

563
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,679
- You buggin'. We just signed
our first record deal.
- Look, he dead, son.

564
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,677
Ain't nothing we can do about it.
Come on, Frank. That's it.

565
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,792
<i>- What do you mean he's dead?</i>
- He's not dead.

566
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,354
It's a heroin overdose.
Let's break out the Narcan.

567
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,156
He's dead, unless you folks wanna stop
bullshitting me and tell it straight.

568
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,158
Then, the good Lord willing,
we'll try and bring him back.

569
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,237
<i>He broke up</i>
<i>with his old lady.</i>

570
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,954
- We didn't break up.
We were just seeing other people.
- Oh, she broke his heart.

571
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,152
<i>- Shut up, arsehole! Nobody asked you!</i>
- Was I talking to you?

572
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,396
Dick, shut up!

573
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,317
I'm still waiting
and this young man here is still dead.

574
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,989
<i>- You wanna leave here</i>
<i>in a body bag too?</i>
<i>- You'll end up like him, dick!</i>

575
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,159
<i>- Shut up!</i>
- He's been snorting
that Red Death stuff.

576
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,352
It's been going on
for, like, four days now.

577
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,315
I rebuke the spirit of drugs
in the name of Jesus. What's his name?

578
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,396
<i>- I.B. Bangin'.</i>
- What you mean I.B. Bangin'?

579
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,556
- I.B. Bangin'.
- What the hell kind of name
is I.B. Bangin'?

580
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,557
<i>- I don't know his real name.</i>
- It's Frederick Smith.

581
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,477
<i>- Okay, Freddy...</i>
- It's Frederick.

582
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,797
Okay, I.B. Bangin', we're gonna
bring you back from the dead.

583
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,878
<i>Now, I want everybody here to grab</i>
<i>the hand of the person next to you.</i>

584
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,797
Come on now.
We ain't got much time.

585
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,150
<i>And look up</i>
<i>towards the heavens.</i>

586
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,114
<i>Dear Lord,</i>
<i>here I am again...</i>

587
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,313
asking one more chance
for a sinner.

588
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,956
Please, Lord, bring back
I.B. Bangin', Lord.

589
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,675
You have the power, Jesus.
You have the might.

590
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,554
You have the super light
to spare this worthless man.

591
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,473
<i>- My God! Frederick!</i>
- Rise up, I.B. Bangin'...

592
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,114
and start your life anew!

593
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,037
Oh, thank You, Lord.

594
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,072
- What happened?
- You fucking died, you stupid bastard.

595
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,634
- I warned you.
- Damn, you guys are good.
<i>- Not us.</i>

596
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,151
The first step is Love.
The second is Mercy.

597
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,879
That guy I brought in yesterday,
post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

598
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,833
Burke? You're not gonna believe it.
He's showing cognitive signs.

599
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,316
It started with spontaneous respiration.
Now he's fighting to pull out the tube.

600
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,352
He had to be sedated. He's in CAT scan.
There's no room in I.C.U.

601
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,277
- What do you think?
<i>- Who knows?</i>

602
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,075
<i>It's all lower brain stem</i>
<i>activity at this point.</i>
<i>The heart refuses to stabilize.</i>

603
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,954
You know, he coded 11 times
since he got here.

604
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,877
<i>But the guy's a fighter.</i>

605
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,831
<i>Every time the Valium wears off,</i>
<i>he starts yanking on the restraints.</i>

606
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,712
The family know?

607
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,956
<i>I wanted to bring them in</i>
<i>to see if he'd respond to voices.</i>

608
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,877
But there was no one
in the waiting room.

609
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,797
This guy's daughter
was in my face all night.

610
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,717
Finally, I got something
positive to tell her, she's gone.

611
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,515
You put poison in your veins,
and now that you're breathing again,

612
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,519
you can't wait to say
"Thank you very much"
and get back out to poison shopping.

613
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,200
Well, since we saved your life,
could you do us a favor...

614
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,117
<i>and stop breathing</i>
<i>in another city next time?</i>

615
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,037
I ever tell you
about that time years ago...

616
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,470
I was on this ledge uptown
trying to pull this damn psycho inside?

617
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,388
You mean where the guy jumped
and you almost fell?
No, you never told me <i>that</i> story.

618
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,317
<i>No, you never listened.</i>

619
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,355
There I was.
I put everything I had into saving
this dumb-ass, low-life suicidal...

620
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,836
that when he went down,
it was like I wanted to go with him.

621
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,757
<i>That happened once in Ireland.</i>

622
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,793
This girl jumped off the cliffs
of Moher and the wind blew her back up.

623
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,595
- The wind blew her back up?
- Yeah, the wind.

624
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,154
- No, that was Jesus, son.
- It was also the wind.

625
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,475
<i>The wind, my black ass.</i>
<i>That was Jesus.</i>

626
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,352
<i>Don't tell me</i>
<i>about the Good Book.</i>

627
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,074
<i>I'll preach heaven and beat the hell</i>
<i>out of you. Don't tell me that now.</i>

628
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,077
I was going, son.

629
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,796
But if someone up on high... Thank You,
Jesus... hadn't have pulled me in...

630
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,876
<i>Would you turn left here?</i>
<i>I wanna make a stop.</i>

631
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,438
<i>The point is, everybody go through a</i>
<i>stretch where folks gonna die on you.</i>

632
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,710
Just don't meditate on it.

633
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,359
I'll be right back.

634
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,838
Hello. It's Frank Pierce
from the ambulance last night.

635
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,996
I brought your father
into the hospital.

636
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,032
<i>- I just learned some news.</i>
<i>- I'll be right down.</i>

637
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,837
He's better, isn't he?

638
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,235
<i>Well, the doctor says</i>
<i>he's showing some movement.</i>

639
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,716
I mean, it's still early. It might mean
nothing, but I thought you'd wanna know.

640
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,311
Yeah, I knew.
I sensed it when I heard your voice.

641
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,674
You-You look so different.

642
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,109
Oh.
It's awful, isn't it?

643
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,674
It's like <i>Night</i>
<i>of the Living Cheerleaders.</i>

644
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,031
No, I think it looks good.

645
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,596
Ah, I was going nuts in that waiting
room. I came back to check on my mom.

646
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,792
<i>- How is she?</i>
- She's sleeping.

647
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,753
Sleeping.

648
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,279
I was just gonna get some food.
Pizza. I thought maybe we...

649
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,234
You can't kill my father that easy.
He's a real fighter, like with me.

650
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,079
He hasn't talked to me in three years.
But it's okay.

651
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,794
Sometimes you just have
to put things behind you.

652
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,753
I gotta be getting back.
Hey. Hey!

653
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,555
It'll be tough to get a taxi here.
We can give you a ride if you like.

654
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,511
Okay.

655
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,077
<i>Who that?</i>

656
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,555
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest
I brought in last night.

657
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,309
I told her we'd give her a ride
back to Misery. Her father's
showing signs of improving.

658
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,638
Oh, Frank, you got it bad, son.
So much worse than what I thought.

659
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,718
- I'm hungry too. We gotta get
something to eat after this.
- God, help us. He's hungry.

660
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,950
Dad?

661
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,833
Can you hear me?

662
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,791
It's Mary.

663
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,472
Squeeze my hand if
you can hear me, Dad.

664
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,273
He squeezed my hand.

665
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,630
He's moving, Doctor.
He grabbed my hand.

666
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,399
Come on, Dad. Show 'em.
Come on. See? See?

667
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,592
<i>I'll be damned. It's movement.</i>
<i>Just not sure how voluntary it is.</i>

668
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,234
<i>No, he heard me.</i>

669
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,079
<i>Come on, Dad. Yeah.</i>

670
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,709
Oh! Nurse Crupp.

671
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,753
<i>Nurse Crupp!</i>
<i>Ten milligrams of Valium!</i>

672
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,838
<i>Get over here.</i>

673
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,599
<i>- Where's that Valium?</i>
- Why don't we step out
for a little while,

674
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,517
- wait till this passes.
<i>- Make sure he's breathing.</i>

675
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,552
He wants
to pull that tube out.

676
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,672
It's pretty painful.
That's why they keep him sedated.

677
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,189
- But it's a good sign.
- Are you sure?

678
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,276
I know my father
would hate being tied down.

679
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,356
He wouldn't even go
to the dentist.

680
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,119
That's how it's done.

681
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,750
You have to keep the body going
until the brain and the heart...

682
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,677
recover enough
to go on their own.

683
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,234
He's better though, right?

684
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,397
He's better.

685
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,076
I'm sorry.
It's just...

686
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,509
It's important to me.
I mean, a week ago...

687
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,837
I was wishing he was dead.

688
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,872
And now, I wanna hear
his voice just once more.

689
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,956
You know what I mean?

690
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,150
<i>Went over to Ray's and got this.</i>

691
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,431
Must be a place reserved in hell
for somebody who charges $1.50 a slice.

692
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,357
Anything comes up,
I'll call you.

693
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,040
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Marcus.

694
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,194
Oh, thank...
I'm not really hungry.

695
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,353
You know, my father's
a really wonderful man.

696
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,755
There was nobody
he wouldn't help.

697
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,519
You know that crazy guy, Noel,
who I gave water to last night?

698
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,474
<i>He lived at our house</i>
<i>for almost a year.</i>

699
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,637
Total stranger
he'd do anything for.

700
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,557
His own family, though...

701
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,717
It's best not to...
dwell.

702
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,717
Yeah.

703
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,035
It's good pizza, huh?

704
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,549
Mmm, it's not as good
as, uh, Nino's.

705
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,356
<i>You remember that pizza place,</i>
<i>Mimi's, on 10th, maybe 15 years ago?</i>

706
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,155
When you ordered a pie, it came with
a little plastic Madonna in the middle.

707
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,192
Saint Anthony, yeah.
You from the neighborhood?

708
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,959
- I grew up on 43rd.
I went to Holy Cross.
<i>- Really?</i>

709
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,833
I went to Sacred Heart.
Where'd you go to high school?

710
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,670
Well, you know, Mary,
we moved out after that. Upstate.

711
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,076
Yeah. Like everybody else,
except us.

712
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,757
<i>- So, your parents... Good.</i>
- They're fine.

713
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,077
My old man's a bus driver,
and Mom a nurse.

714
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,714
Sort of born to it,
I guess.

715
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,076
- You married?
<i>- Uh, no.</i>

716
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,840
I was.

717
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,757
Hard to explain.

718
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,793
She had a hard time
adjusting to, uh...

719
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,629
Well, maybe-maybe
it was my fault too.

720
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,149
<i>White cocksucker!</i>
<i>Don't be touchin' me!</i>

721
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,477
Is it always this bad in here?
How does anybody survive?

722
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,354
<i>- Gosh.</i>
- Well, it's been bad lately,
but it's-it's always bad.

723
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,040
How long have you been doing this?

724
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,116
Five years.

725
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,959
Wow. You must've
seen some things, huh?

726
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,878
Well, no. I mean, you sort of learn
to block it out, you know?

727
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,471
It's like, um... like cops
fencing off a crime scene.

728
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,479
But then,
something good'll happen.

729
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,319
Everything just glows.

730
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,309
You must get
a lot of overdoses.

731
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,715
Bet you picked me up
a couple times.

732
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,591
I think I'd remember that.

733
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,075
Maybe not.

734
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,236
I was a different person then.

735
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,630
Does everyone you meet
just...

736
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,355
- spill their guts on you like this?
- Uh, mostly.

737
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,311
Must be my face.

738
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,431
My mother always said
I look like a priest.

739
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,358
You do. Yeah.

740
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,358
Yeah, my mom thought
I was gonna be a nun...

741
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,429
because, uh, I ran away
to a convent when I was 13.

742
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,429
But I didn't want to be a nun.
I just... I wanted to run away.

743
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:39,509
Well, Sister Mary or Mary the Junkie,
it didn't really matter to me.

744
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,268
- You know, I better go
check on my father.
- Yeah, all right.

745
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,430
Thanks for the pizza.
I owe you one.

746
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,757
Maybe, um,
when he gets better.

747
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,429
- When we're through with all of this.
- Sure.

748
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,717
Look after her, Griss,
okay?

749
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,392
Rule number one: Don't
get involved with patients.

750
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,432
Rule number two: Don't get involved
with patients' daughters.

751
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,357
- You understand?
What about rule number three?

752
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,277
Don't get involved
with dispatchers named Love.

753
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,834
Now, boy, you don't know nothin'
about rule number three.

754
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,589
Cannot begin to understand
the complexities of that rule.

755
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,716
Come on. Let's go look
at some hookers, hmm?

756
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,515
Kit Kat Club
be lettin' out 'bout now.

757
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,437
<i>74-Will. 330, West 33rd.</i>

758
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,120
<i>Church of Jesus Son,</i>

<i>hearin' celebrity voices.</i>

<i>541 West 54th St,</i>

<i>abducted by her cat.</i>

763
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,715
<i>Look at these women.</i>
<i>Can't even tell who's a hooker no more.</i>

764
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,956
<i>Whatever happened to</i>
<i>go-go boots and hot pants?</i>

765
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,877
<i>They'll wear anything now.</i>

766
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,355
Walk out the house
with whatever they got on.

767
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,675
You got the wrong guy!
Hands off, baby!

768
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,950
<i>The street's not like the E.R.</i>

769
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,392
<i>There's no walls, no controls.</i>

770
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,432
<i>To make up for that, they try</i>
<i>to teach me how to act without thinking,</i>

771
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:19,839
<i>like a soldier who can take apart</i>
<i>and reassemble a gun blindfolded.</i>

772
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,872
Kick his ass!
Fuck him up! Fuck him up!

773
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,753
Kick his ass!
Beat the shit out of him, baby!

774
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,677
<i>Beat the shit out of him!</i>

775
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,597
<i>I realized</i>
<i>that my training was useful...</i>

776
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,995
<i>in less than ten percent</i>
<i>of the calls,</i>

777
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,908
<i>and saving someone's life</i>
<i>was rarer than that.</i>

778
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,429
<i>After a while,</i>
<i>I grew to understand...</i>

779
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,509
<i>that my role was less about saving</i>
<i>lives than about bearing witness.</i>

780
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,870
<i>I was a grief mop.</i>

781
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,230
<i>It was enough that</i>
<i>I simply showed up.</i>

782
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,193
<i>Except with Rose.</i>

783
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,837
<i>Shut up!</i>

784
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,589
- I'll get ya a glass of water.
Noel, I'm your friend.

785
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,280
Come on, calm down.
I'm gonna take you to a spa.

786
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,960
I'm gonna get you a facial. Shh, shh.

787
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,275
<i>Get him in there!</i>

788
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,514
<i>Look-Look-Look at that.</i>
<i>Hmm? Look at that.</i>

789
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,076
Leaves you with no idea what's
underneath. Not even a suggestion.

790
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,714
<i>Could be a skeleton</i>
<i>for all you know.</i>

791
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,119
<i>Yeah, that-that's nice, though.</i>
<i>Right there. Mm-hmm.</i>

792
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,516
<i>Pullin' back her hood</i>
<i>as we drive by.</i>

793
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,949
See, there's a mystery to it.

794
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,196
<i>- Then she shows ya.</i>
- She's not a whore, Marcus.

795
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,356
<i>We're all whores, Frank.</i>

796
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,074
You know what I'm talkin' about?
The way she looked at me.

797
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,272
She wasn't lookin' at you, man.
She was lookin' at me.

798
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,437
Why did you kill me, Frank?

799
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,869
- I didn't kill you.
- No, you didn't, Frank, and thank you.

800
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,797
But there's still a couple hours
left on our shift.

801
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,957
- No, it's not you. It's some...
- You hearin' them voices again?

802
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,594
- I just need a drink.
- What-What them voices sayin' to ya?

803
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,517
They say, "Kill Marcus!"
Okay?

804
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,313
That ain't funny, Frank.

805
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,556
Look, I don't need shock treatments.
I'm not sick, all right?

806
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,477
- I just need a drink.
- Okay.

807
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,875
<i>62-Young,</i>
<i>answer the radio. I have a call for you.</i>

808
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,751
<i>I can't wait all night, Young.</i>
<i>I'm holdin' a priority,</i>

809
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,677
<i>and if you don't answer</i>
<i>I'm gonna knock you outta service.</i>

810
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,315
62-Young is here, baby,
and I'm gonna help you out.

811
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,159
Just remember,
you owe me.

812
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,669
<i>You're going to 370 West 98th Street.</i>

813
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,110
<i>17-year-old female, cardiac arrest.</i>
<i>No further information.</i>

814
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,789
- 10-4, hon.
- Why is everything a cardiac arrest?

815
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,436
What happened to chest pain,
difficulty breathing, fractured hands?

816
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,949
Come on, people!

817
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,391
Lord Jesus,
help me get through the night.

818
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,719
I hate this block.
Nothin' but crackheads.

819
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,115
- I don't wanna go in there
without the police.
- I'm goin'.

820
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,037
It's easier than waitin'.

821
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,077
E.M.S!

822
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,237
- Ambulance!
- Oh, Jesus. My bad back.

823
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,636
<i>My feet hurt.</i>
<i>Damn crackheads.</i>

824
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,435
- E.M.S!
- Hello? E.M.S.

825
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,117
Hello?

826
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,792
Please, hurry.

827
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,268
Please hurry.
Come this way, please.

828
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,676
- She's over here.
This way. Hurry.

829
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,630
<i>My, oh, my, a fat crackhead!</i>
<i>Now, that's a first.</i>

830
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,595
- What's wrong?
- No English. She has
terrible pain in her belly.

831
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,996
- I mean, she's pregnant.
- No, no, that's impossible.
We're virgins.

832
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,953
Are you pregnant?
<i>¿Estas embarazada?</i>

833
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,992
Can you walk?
<i>¿Puedes caminar?</i>

834
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,951
- She say she in great pain.
- Thank-Thank you.

835
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,355
Thank you for the translation.
What's your name?

836
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,314
<i>- ¿Nombre?</i>
All right, let's have a look.
- Maria! Maria!

837
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,751
You two know each other
a long time?

838
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,871
Yeah, two years,
ever since we left the island.

839
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,468
This is a personal question,
but I gotta ask it.

840
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,592
- In all that time, you never had sex?
- No, never.

841
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,474
Maybe you had a couple of beers
one night last summer.
You know how it works, son.

842
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,194
- No cigarettes, no drugs, no beer.
- No underwear?

843
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,392
- We're virgins!
- Oh, Jesus, we'd better go.
Call for backup!

844
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,114
<i>- It's coming. Hold her down.</i>
- My God! What the hell is that?

845
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,118
- It's three legs.
- That's too many!

846
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,798
<i>- They're comin'!</i>
- Is she dying?

847
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,717
<i>- She's having a baby. Twins.</i>
- That's <i>imposible.</i>

848
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,071
It's possible! It's possible!
She's having a baby, okay?

849
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,430
It's a miracle.

850
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,229
Contractions stopped.
Help me get her out of here.

851
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,316
Ow!
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

852
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,750
My back. Hold it.

853
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,474
- All right, look,
let's just put her down.

854
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,114
Put her over here.
Let's just put her down.

855
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,198
You take the first one.

856
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,148
It's a boy, Frank.
He looks good.

857
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,396
How's yours?

858
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,316
Open the door!

859
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,510
She had a pulse!

860
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,392
<i>Code! Code blue!</i>

861
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,149
<i>- We're set up in Two.</i>
- Jesus Christ. Get her on the monitor.

862
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,748
<i>- Where's the pediatric cart?</i>
- It's right here.

863
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,235
- Give me the blade.
How many months, Frank?
- Can't tell.

864
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,794
- It was a breech. Twins.
The other seems okay.
- Step back, Frank.

865
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,911
Marcus is taking him
and the mother to Maternity.

866
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,554
<i>I'm a mother!</i>
<i>I got a daughter! I got rights!</i>

867
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,035
<i>- Start compression.</i>
- Give her some Valium!

868
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,118
- Ten mil, stat!
- Flatline. Let's start C.P.R.

869
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,232
- Starting.
- Status?

870
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,314
<i>I think I got a pulse. I think.</i>

871
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,797
- Fuck!
- Nothing!

872
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,391
<i>- Give me an I.V. line.</i>
<i>- Call X ray.</i>

873
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,511
<i>- I.V. 's in. Give me epinephrine.</i>
<i>- How long has she been down?</i>

874
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,471
<i>- About ten minutes.</i>
<i>- Call respiratory.</i>

875
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,115
<i>- Excuse me, sir. Can I please</i>
<i>bother you for a cup of water?</i>
<i>- Can we get an X ray here?</i>

876
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,276
Oh, my God.

877
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,550
- For days, I have eaten
nothing but sand, O Lord.
<i>- Stop compression.</i>

878
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,035
- I've waited so long.
<i>- All right, status?</i>

879
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,469
- Can I please get some fucking water?
<i>- Flatline!</i>

880
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,431
Jesus Christ!
Who woke that guy up?

881
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,357
- Come on.
- I've got nothing.

882
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,630
<i>Shit.</i>

883
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,832
<i>Are the parents here?</i>
<i>Someone's gonna have to tell 'em.</i>

884
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,151
Don't give me that look.

885
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,714
- What look?
- You know what look.
It's all over your face.

886
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,400
That I-Just-Saved-
A-Little-Baby-Boy look.

887
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,637
<i>We</i> just saved a little,
bouncin' baby boy.

888
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,796
- Think of it that way.
- I don't wanna hear about it, okay?

889
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,070
That's three jobs for the night.
It's over. Three jobs.

890
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,953
Time for a drink.
Six A.M.., the cocktail hour.

891
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,548
So, pass the bottle.
I know you're holding.

892
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,478
The bar is now open.

893
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,909
I hate gin.

894
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,395
You know, when I had that
little baby in my hands,

895
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,750
I felt like I was
21 again.

896
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,714
Call like that makes me wanna go back
to workin' three nights a week, not two.

897
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:20,992
- You know, start runnin' again,
cut down on my drinkin'.
- I'll drink to that.

898
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,351
Here's to the greatest job
in the world.

899
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,317
The greatest job in the world.

900
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,034
<i>62-Young, I have</i>
<i>priorities holdin'. Pick up the radio.</i>

901
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,957
Don't do it, Marcus.
Please.

902
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,911
Tell her the bus died.
Tell her the radio's not working.

903
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,837
Tell her
our backs are out.

904
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,952
Tell her... Tell her we're too drunk
to take any more calls.

905
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,957
Okay?

906
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,671
- Let's take it!
- No!

907
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,634
62-Young, this is Marcus.
Only for you, baby! Only for you!

908
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,557
<i>- Keep it to yourself, Young.</i>

909
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,240
<i>Male diff breather, approximately 30.</i>
<i>West End and 72nd.</i>

910
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,635
10-4, hon.
I'm comin', baby!

911
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,751
Big Daddy Marcus is comin'!

912
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,996
- We comin'! We comin'!
- No!

913
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,712
<i>Lord have mercy!</i>

914
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,437
<i>Thank You, Jesus.</i>

915
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,518
- Are you all right?
- Amen. Thank You, Jesus.

916
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,712
Oh, thank You, Lord.

917
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,796
Oh, thank You, Jesus.

918
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,639
That is the last time
you do this to me, Marcus.

919
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,469
- Where are you goin', Frank?
- I quit!

920
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,397
I'm through.

921
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,637
Oh, you think just 'cause you quit,
them ghosts gonna quit too?

922
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,228
It don't work
that way, Frank!

923
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,476
I've been there, son!

924
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,114
You need the Holy Ghost, Frank!

925
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,071
The Holy Ghost!

926
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,717
Noel.

927
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,838
- What's going on, Griss?
- Your friend there just
untied the water beggar.

928
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,748
Griss was comin' out to thank her.
Probably saved Griss a murder charge.

929
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,189
She's having a tough time, though.

930
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,193
Excuse me. You seemed
like you were in trouble.

931
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,231
<i>No, I'm all right.</i>
<i>I just...</i>

932
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,999
I can't stand seeing
people tied up.

933
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,318
I'm in that waitin' room for hours,
and I'm listenin' to Noel screamin'.

934
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,000
And the only reason that's
he's screamin' is 'cause he's tied up!

935
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,230
- Don't seem so bad to me.
<i>- Don't say that.</i>

936
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,476
<i>I almost cut</i>
<i>my father loose too.</i>

937
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,319
You know, one minute they
tell me that he's almost dead.

938
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,318
The next minute, they tell me
he's better and I can go in and...

939
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,228
It's killing me
seeing him fight like that.

940
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,879
Well, since you're here,
maybe, uh,

941
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,390
maybe you could
do me a favor and, uh...

942
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,956
wait for me outside
this building, 'cause I gotta
go visit a friend who's sick.

943
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,591
Okay.

944
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,394
I'm only asking you because
this is a dangerous building,

945
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,795
and there's been some robberies and
a woman was raped not long ago, and...

946
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,718
<i>This woman I'm seeing, she's gonna</i>
<i>wanna sit and talk with me all day,</i>

947
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,637
but if I can point to you out the window
and tell her that you're waitin',

948
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,557
then she'll
let me out quick.

949
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,477
If anything happens,
I'm in 16-M.

950
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,397
Maybe I should
come up with you.

951
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,909
<i>If I'm not back in 15 minutes</i>
<i>just hit the buzzer,</i>
<i>and that way she'll let me go.</i>

952
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,837
If that's what's gonna happen.
I'll come with you.

953
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,757
I'm okay. I'm just
visiting a friend who's sick.

954
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,314
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

955
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,317
You asked me not to come.

956
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,635
Promise you won't
go inside.

957
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,035
Fifteen minutes.

958
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,435
You know, everyone
at that hospital's crazy!

959
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,757
I'm going crazy too.
You understand?

960
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,269
I just have to...

961
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:34,190
I just have to relax a little
and not feel so guilty all the time.

962
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,709
We can still go back.

963
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,354
I'll walk you home.
You sleep for a couple hours.

964
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,277
Watch some TV.
Take a bath.

965
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,197
Don't be such a cop.

966
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,876
If you have any doubts
about this, it's my fault.

967
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,468
You go on home.
Really.

968
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,875
I'm fine.
Thanks.

969
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,316
I don't need you.

970
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,955
- Hi.
- Hey, Cy, guess who's here.

971
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,037
Can I help you?

972
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,674
Mary Burke.
She's a friend.

973
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,597
She's not here.

974
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,517
Wait a minute. You can't go in.

975
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,437
<i>- Kanita?</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

976
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,357
<i>- Hey, Cy!</i>
- Be cool. Be cool.

977
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,472
- It's all good.
<i>- He looks like a cop.</i>

978
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,718
No, he ain't no cop. You're a medic,
right? I'm Cy. Cy Coates.

979
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,671
Frank Pierce.

980
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,870
Mary said you might
be coming over.

981
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,118
- Where is she?
- Sleepin', brother, in the back.

982
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,037
She asked me
to pick her up,

983
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,310
go out for a movie and a malt
and bring her right home.

984
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,556
I know, I know.
I know.

985
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,719
But she told me to tell you she
wants to crash here a few hours.

986
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,355
See, it's terrible
about her father and everything.

987
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,995
I better just go in and see her.

988
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,271
Frank, see,
I call this the Oasis.

989
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,994
It's a refuge from
the world out there.

990
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,588
You wanna come in here,
relax, sit down.

991
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,870
It's all right.
Brother, she is sound asleep.

992
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,797
She ain't gonna know
any difference.

993
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,037
No, I'm gonna go see her.

994
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,517
Well, did you know two people got shot
in this buildin' last week?

995
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,677
A priest got robbed
by ten-year-olds across the street.

996
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,917
<i>Oh, brother, be careful.</i>
<i>That's the Tiger.</i>

997
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,793
Lady's down the hall.

998
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,751
Clean up that nose,
brother.

999
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,110
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>Dayrise Enterprises, Frank.</i>

1000
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,310
<i>Stress-free factory.</i>

1001
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,194
Mary. Mary.

1002
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,153
We have to get going.

1003
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,077
She asked for something
to help her sleep, brother.

1004
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,430
Mary, we really have to go.

1005
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:11,348
- Whoa, Frank, she suffered
enough, all right?

1006
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,836
Now, she's gonna be fine.
I promise.

1007
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,520
Come on, Frank.

1008
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,237
Now, I'm always
interested in people
with stressful occupations.

1009
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:31,036
Now, bein' a paramedic, that's about
as stressful as I can imagine.

1010
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,674
<i>Go ahead, take a seat.</i>
<i>Sit down.</i>

1011
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,837
<i>Tell me some war stories.</i>
<i>You know, what's it like?</i>

1012
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,237
Got a beer?

1013
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,590
Oh, that shit
is poison, Frank.

1014
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,517
We don't have
alcohol around here.

1015
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,189
What you need
is one of these.

1016
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,520
Did-Did you give Mary
something called Red Death?

1017
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,995
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1018
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,717
Red Death.

1019
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,751
Tell me something, Frank.

1020
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,115
Does killing your clients sound like
good business sense to you? Hmm?

1021
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,153
<i>See, the kids sellin' that Red Death</i>
<i>are just tryin' to make a quick buck.</i>

1022
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,272
<i>They don't got no respect for me</i>
<i>or the work I done in this community.</i>

1023
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,710
But don't worry.
They're gonna be taken care of.

1024
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,434
<i>I got Tiger workin' on it.</i>

1025
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,154
- I should be going. I just quit.
<i>- Oh, look.</i>

1026
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,840
Sleep is all
stress reduction.

1027
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,838
All right?
Here.

1028
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,839
Now, if you take one of these,
sleep for two hours...

1029
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,474
That's all you need.

1030
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,757
Why do you think
I'm tellin' you this, Frank?

1031
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,791
<i>For my health?</i>

1032
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,037
Now, brother, you gotta look at yourself
in the mirror, all right?

1033
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,276
Kanita.

1034
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,517
<i>Would you get our new friend</i>
<i>here a glass of water, please?</i>

1035
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,790
<i>Oh, you're so fine.</i>

1036
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,711
Is this what you gave Mary?

1037
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,718
Yep, that's the stuff.
I call it the Red Lion.

1038
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,229
It's very king-of-the-jungle,
"Makuna matata," all that.

1039
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,669
<i>There's no language.</i>
<i>Just brute power.</i>

1040
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,950
But, see,

1041
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:35,870
you just ain't gonna believe
how relaxin' that shit
really is, all right?

1042
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,755
- I guess I'll be going.
<i>- Just relax.</i>

1043
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,553
You at the Oasis now.

1044
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,511
All right?

1045
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,791
Take my pulse.

1046
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,031
It's good, isn't it?

1047
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,991
It's perfect.

1048
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,112
It's two beats per minute.

1049
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,674
I knew it.

1050
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,631
I was wrong about you.

1051
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,837
You're not so bad.

1052
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,069
- You're in the stomach.
- You sure?

1053
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,036
You're in the stomach again.

1054
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,594
<i>- You're in the stomach again.</i>
<i>Let me try.</i>
- One more time.

1055
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,711
- Rose.
- Huh?

1056
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,479
My name, Rose.

1057
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,511
- Stomach again.
- No way!

1058
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,915
No pulse.
Let me try.

1059
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,519
<i>No pulse!</i>
<i>No pulse, goddam it!</i>

1060
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,274
<i>Frank! Frank! Take it easy!</i>
<i>Okay, what happened?</i>

1061
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,870
<i>- He flipped out!</i>
- All right, now, Frank...
Frank, be cool, my brother.

1062
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,639
- You're havin' what you call
a paradoxical reaction.

1063
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:57,479
<i>- He's psycho!</i>
- Listen to me, Frank.

1064
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,239
<i>Frank, where are you goin'?</i>
<i>You're makin' a mistake.</i>

1065
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:03,909
<i>Yeah, you go. Okay, that's good.</i>
<i>You go in there.</i>

1066
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,919
<i>You go in there, lie down.</i>
<i>Get some sleep, whatever.</i>

1067
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,874
<i>Hey. Look.</i>

1068
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,195
- Cy, you want me to stop this?
<i>- No, Tiger, it's all right.</i>

1069
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,117
<i>- You sure?</i>
<i>- It's cool. Be cool. Let him go.</i>

1070
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,276
Let him go.

1071
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,675
Put me down!

1072
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,709
<i>Frank, you are makin'</i>
<i>a serious mistake, my man.</i>

1073
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,435
<i>She's just gonna come back.</i>
<i>Oh, and Frank, you owe me ten dollars.</i>

1074
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,359
Put me down.

1075
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,191
Get off!

1076
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,038
<i>- Did you and Cy have a nice talk?</i>
- Let go!

1077
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,596
Did he tell you about
Dayrise Enterprises helping people?

1078
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,514
Well, I've seen him
hurt people.

1079
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,435
Why are you following me?

1080
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,716
Because you
can barely walk.

1081
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:18,194
You remember Noel from the other night?
How Noel is now?

1082
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,311
He wasn't always like that.

1083
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,791
He was my brother's
best friend.

1084
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,390
Cy or Tiger or one of those goons
put a bullet in Noel's head.

1085
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,317
He was in a coma
for three months.

1086
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,910
He's been crazy
ever since.

1087
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,757
This is...

1088
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,030
my building.

1089
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,110
What is it with you?
You wanna help me?

1090
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,630
You feel sorry for me?
Well, keep it to yourself.

1091
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,320
I just need to sit down
for a minute.

1092
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:59,557
You wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.

1093
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,674
Hi! Hi.

1094
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,828
I've been clean for two years.
No drugs. I got a job.

1095
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,520
I paint when I'm at home.
I don't bother anybody.

1096
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,110
Then all this shit happens.
Oh, no, you don't.

1097
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,196
Hey, you can't stay here.
Come on.

1098
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,436
Get up.

1099
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,037
Hello. I'm Frank.

1100
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,071
Mary's friend.

1101
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,351
A very close friend
who loves animals.

1102
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,957
Hello?

1103
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,149
<i>I washed my face</i>
<i>with three kinds of soap,</i>

1104
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,953
<i>each smelling</i>
<i>like a different season.</i>

1105
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,197
<i>It felt good to be</i>
<i>in a woman's room again,</i>

1106
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:21,155
<i>especially a woman who wasn't comatose</i>
<i>or severely disabled.</i>

1107
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,238
<i>I felt like perhaps</i>
<i>I had turned a corner...</i>

1108
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,555
<i>like I saved someone...</i>

1109
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,636
<i>though I didn't know who.</i>

1110
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,356
Hey, Pierce.

1111
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,835
You're late, I know it,
but I can't fire you today.

1112
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,475
- I got nobody to ride
66-X ray with Wolls.
- No.

1113
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,398
I got a form for you to make out about
the accident when you get some time.

1114
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,159
Come here, kid.
Come here.

1115
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,635
Look, I'm gonna fire you tomorrow.
I promise you.

1116
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,149
What-What if there is
no tomorrow?

1117
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,396
Will you get out of here
before I give you a big hug!

1118
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,830
"No tomorrow."
I love that kid.

1119
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,552
Frank. Hey, man.
What do you know?

1120
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,069
You and me again, tonight.
The Rough Riders,

1121
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,556
tearin' up the streets
just like old times, huh?

1122
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,911
This old bus is a warrior, Frank.

1123
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,837
Just like us.

1124
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,838
I have tried to kill him...
many times,

1125
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,076
and he will not die.

1126
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,714
I have great respect for that.

1127
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,116
Okay.

1128
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,720
Get up, right now!
Get up! Cool it!

1129
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:37,832
I already told you you can't go
in there! Didn't you hear me?

1130
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,916
Don't make me take off
my sunglasses!

1131
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,793
- Good morning, Griss.
- We're full up here tonight, Frank.

1132
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,434
Get the hell out of here.
Step back! Step back!

1133
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,837
<i>Go to the bank,</i>
<i>boy. Take out everything you can.</i>

1134
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,077
Mr. Burke?

1135
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,918
<i>I'm going.</i>
<i>I've had enough.</i>

1136
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,353
- You do it.
- I can't reach. You're taller.

1137
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,199
<i>- Don't do it!</i>
- He's getting better.

1138
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,117
- Better than what? It doesn't matter!
- Better than what?

1139
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,310
- Why not?
- The family wants us to keep him alive.

1140
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,237
The wife wants to believe in miracles.
We keep him alive.

1141
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,476
Shock him, Frank. He'll come back.
He always comes back.

1142
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,637
Clear!

1143
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,637
<i>- You son of a bitch!</i>
- Nothing. Shock him again.

1144
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,557
<i>Don't do it!</i>

1145
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,955
<i>- Son of a bitch!</i>
<i>- Do it again.</i>

1146
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,913
<i>Don't do it!</i>

1147
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,076
Frank!

1148
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,237
<i>Jesus! Move! Move!</i>

1149
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,157
Clear!

1150
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,840
<i>Hey, boy. Where you goin', Frank?</i>

1151
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,552
<i>Hey, Frank!</i>

1152
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,791
Frank? Frank, what the hell
you doin' back there?

1153
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,195
I'm sick, Tom.
I need a cure.

1154
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,029
Vitamin B cocktail, followed
by an amp of glucose...

1155
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,038
and a drop of adrenaline.

1156
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,720
It's not as good as beer,
but it's all I got.

1157
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,276
Come on, Frank. There's blood spillin'
in the streets. Let's go have some fun.

1158
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,677
Watch out.

1159
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,674
You all right?

1160
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,075
These are hard times, Tom.

1161
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,077
Yeah, it's great,
isn't it?

1162
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,634
It's great to be drunk.
Sobriety's killing me.

1163
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,035
Look up in the sky, Frank.
It's a full moon.

1164
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,469
Blood's gonna run tonight.
I can <i>feel</i> it.

1165
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,194
Our mission:
to save lives.

1166
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,709
Our mission is coffee, Tom.

1167
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,798
A shot of the bull.
Puerto Rican espresso.

1168
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,956
10-4.
El Toro de Oro.

1169
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,911
Blast off!

1170
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,878
This cure's not working, Tom.
Maybe we should go back to the hospital.

1171
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,150
Oh, come on. Don't worry.
Tom will take care of ya.

1172
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,714
Put your head out the window.
Get some of that nice clean air.

1173
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,479
- Come on, stop it!
<i>- Okay, units, it's suicide hour.</i>

1174
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,831
<i>14th and 7th. A man with a noose around</i>
<i>his neck and nothin' to hang it on.</i>

1175
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,713
<i>66-X ray, don't even think about getting</i>
<i>coffee. I have a call for you too.</i>

1176
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,230
66-Exterminator here.
We like our coffee bloody.

1177
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,113
This better be good.
My partner's dying to help someone.

1178
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,949
<i>You're in luck, X.</i>
<i>Your patient awaits you</i>
<i>with bleeding wrists in the tunnel.</i>

1179
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,355
- 10-4.
- Tom, where are the Band-Aids?

1180
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,916
- This is an ambulance, isn't it?
- Be cool, man.

1181
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,110
Look out!

1182
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,909
He does this every time
he gets drunk.

1183
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,150
- You smell that?
<i>- But he hates when I call you guys.</i>

1184
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,196
What the hell's
goin' on here?

1185
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,117
You gotta take him
to the hospital.

1186
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,993
- He tried to kill himself.
- You guys got any coffee?

1187
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,634
- Show him your wrist.
Go ahead, show him.
- All right, come on.

1188
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,718
<i>Let me see.</i>
<i>It's not even bleeding.</i>

1189
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,308
<i>He does this all the time.</i>
<i>He ain't right.</i>

1190
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,715
It was bleedin' before. He kept spilling
his beer. I gave him mouth-to-mouth.

1191
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,831
You're lucky
you didn't kill him.

1192
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,475
I wanna hear it straight
from the Looney Tunes himself.

1193
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,556
Try to bump yourself off?

1194
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,671
Yes.

1195
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,995
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so?

1196
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,032
Come on.
I'm gonna fix you up.

1197
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,310
<i>Come on, Frank.</i>

1198
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,432
Sir, I am going to give you
some medicine that is still
very experimental.

1199
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,473
It's from NASA. And although our
astronauts have been using it for years,

1200
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,636
we are the very
first service to try it.

1201
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,389
Now, I am gonna put this patch
on your forehead, like this.

1202
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,557
And in about a minute,
you will have to relax.

1203
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,240
You will lose all
your suicidal feelings.

1204
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,148
It's very important that you wear
the patch for at least 24 hours.

1205
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,316
And keep checking the mirror.

1206
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,831
<i>If the patch turns green,</i>
<i>you have to see a doctor immediately.</i>

1207
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,713
The side effects could be fatal.
Okay?

1208
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,513
- Okay, now, what did I say?
What color?
- Uh, clean.

1209
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,596
- Clean.
- "Cream." You said "cream."

1210
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,551
- Cream. Green.
- Green.

1211
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,557
This, uh...
Excuse me.

1212
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,354
This is the worst suicide attempt
I've ever seen.

1213
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,029
Can you feel that pulse?
Here? That's where you cut.

1214
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,550
And it's not across.
It's down, like so.

1215
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,477
Here.
Take it.

1216
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,637
- I can't. I can't.
- What?

1217
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,751
Oh, I see.

1218
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,269
With all the poor people
of this city...

1219
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,709
who wanted only to live
and were viciously murdered,

1220
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,479
you have the nerve
to sit here...

1221
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,477
wanting to die
and not go through with it?

1222
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,397
You make me sick!

1223
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,398
Take it! Take it!

1224
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,470
<i>We cured him!</i>

1225
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,718
There's nothin' we can't do
if we just work together.

1226
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,356
I told you to stop
for coffee.

1227
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,310
Thanks a lot.

1228
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,352
It sounds like they're trying to
clean up the bus terminal tonight.

1229
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,030
Hello?
Major Tom to Frank.

1230
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,151
Time to just say "no."

1231
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,272
- Where you goin'?
- Come on, Tom, the city's burning.

1232
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,840
What are you doin'?

1233
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,110
I'm driving
out of myself.

1234
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,869
- Uh, these brakes are shot.
- I've taken that into consideration.

1235
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,560
- Frank? Frank?
- Yeah?

1236
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,830
Are you okay?

1237
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,349
Never felt better in my life.
How are you?

1238
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,357
- I'm good.
- Good.

1239
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,914
<i>66-X ray. X ray-66.</i>

1240
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:55,271
- X.
<i>- First of all, I want you to know</i>
<i>how sorry I am about this.</i>

1241
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:59,518
<i>I've always liked you two. A unit above</i>
<i>none. A legend in its own lunchtime.</i>

1242
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,598
<i>So it hurts me deeply to do this,</i>
<i>but I have no choice.</i>

1243
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,711
<i>You must go to</i>
<i>48th and Broadway.</i>

1244
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:09,072
<i>In front of a liquor store you'll find</i>
<i>a 50-year-old male, unconscious.</i>

1245
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,430
<i>It says here,</i>
<i>"Man smells real bad."</i>

1246
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:14,870
<i>- Do I have to say more?</i>
- But you've said too much already.

1247
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,355
- Mr. Oh!
- It's early for him.

1248
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,277
<i>It's all right. We're not meant</i>
<i>to do Oh tonight.</i>

1249
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,676
Something's gonna happen.
I can feel it!

1250
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,597
<i>Sergeant,</i>
<i>put me on the back of that jumper.</i>

1251
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,517
E.M.S. to Central.
What was that call?

1252
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,438
- E.M.S., a jumper.
A shooting. West Side Projects.
- 10-4.

1253
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,869
One minute out.
Let's go.

1254
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,560
Somebody's gonna kill themselves.
Let's go. I don't wanna miss it.

1255
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,319
<i>66.</i>
<i>66-X ray, level one emergency.</i>

1256
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,237
<i>Level one emergency.</i>
<i>I need units. I need units.</i>

1257
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,237
<i>We got fires in the hole.</i>
<i>8th and Broadway.</i>

1258
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,033
<i>Shots being fired outside</i>
<i>the Dynamite Club. 13th and 6th.</i>

1259
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,118
<i>Fired workers are shooting each other</i>
<i>at the post office. Where are my units?</i>

1260
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,549
<i>Where are my units?</i>
<i>6- 6? 6-6 X-ray?</i>

1261
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:53,195
<i>Level one emergency! Level one</i>
<i>emergency! Where are my units?</i>

1262
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,630
<i>The dead are rising, but you can't tell</i>
<i>their faces from the smoke!</i>

1263
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,228
<i>Somebody holdin' him</i>
<i>or somethin'? Is he trying to jump?</i>

1264
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,157
<i>Go on home, sinners!</i>

1265
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,316
<i>Go back to your opium pipes</i>
<i>and whisky bottles!</i>

1266
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,000
- What's with the rabbis?
- They love to hang around with us.

1267
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:09,112
<i>They offered us money for a new rig,</i>
<i>so I deputized them.</i>

1268
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,834
<i>Back to your slot machines,</i>

1269
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,951
ribbed condoms, Mexican divorces,

1270
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,911
your sex clubs and martinis.

1271
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,749
Back to your hot oil wrestling,
Washington lobbying, organ donation.

1272
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:23,350
- What do we bring?
- Better bring it all.

1273
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,277
You guys grab all the gear.
Let's go.

1274
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,949
- This guy a jumper?
- Got a call for shots fired
on the 16th floor.

1275
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,469
- The jumper called right after.
- He landed on 14.

1276
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,557
I'm goin' to 16.

1277
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,917
He must've left the tub on.

1278
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,036
That's it.
Nobody else home.

1279
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,477
Aye, that's gotta hurt.

1280
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,398
<i>- Tell him not to move.</i>
- I'm going down to 14.

1281
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,515
Forget that thing.
Go with the torch. Go.

1282
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,915
Hey, get this, Frank.
We got two patients.

1283
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,837
Number one:
the scarecrow outside.

1284
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,757
Number two:
the big fellah.

1285
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,314
Misses the railing but breaks
both legs on the balcony.

1286
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,000
<i>Then he throws himself</i>
<i>through the glass window.</i>

1287
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:32,159
Then he starts crawling
that way and, uh, he passed out.

1288
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:38,349
- Well, he's our shish kebab
for the night then.
- Gonna have to torch him.

1289
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,278
- How's he doing?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna work on Sleeping Beauty.

1290
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,757
Hey, big guy!

1291
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,758
Either you jump or you get shot.
What are ya gonna do?

1292
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,677
<i>I think I'd rather get shot.</i>

1293
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,631
<i>Drug dealers.</i>

1294
01:28:55,720 --> 01:29:00,157
- Does that hurt?
- No! No. No.

1295
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,514
I don't think you're cut
through any major arteries.

1296
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,712
We have to get you off this thing
without setting off bleeding.

1297
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,751
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1298
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:13,509
I'll take your blood pressure.

1299
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,757
- All right, I'm in. You in?
- I am now.

1300
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,358
If he happens to fall, I don't think
anybody'd be cryin' too much.

1301
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,198
They're gonna torch the fence. You're
gonna feel the metal getting warm.

1302
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,117
Maybe very warm.

1303
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,231
I can't hold my head up anymore.

1304
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,510
Hold this.

1305
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,070
<i>Jump! Let him fuckin' go!</i>

1306
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,395
- Let him die!
- Let him go!

1307
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,909
So, Frank.

1308
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:48,828
Am I gonna live?

1309
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,520
- You're gonna live.
- Frank.

1310
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,234
That ten dollars
you owe me?

1311
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,430
- Yeah?
- Keep it.

1312
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,028
I've been thinkin'
about things, you know?

1313
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,709
<i>Oh, you guys gave me lots of time</i>
<i>to meditate on the future.</i>

1314
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,637
What'd you do, huh?
Stop for Chinese on the way over here?

1315
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:07,957
I was tired.
I needed a coffee.

1316
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,637
What about Kanita?

1317
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,796
Dead.

1318
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:22,751
That's, uh...
That's too bad.

1319
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,077
Hmm.
See, Frank,

1320
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,556
make some money,
fine-lookin' lady on your arm,

1321
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,114
then everybody wants
to take a piece.

1322
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:35,198
Yeah,
there's some kid...

1323
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,675
who I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes,
comes to the Oasis,

1324
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,756
starts shootin' at me.

1325
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:43,998
The Red Death Gang.
Bunch of 12-year-olds.

1326
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,795
I thought I could make it
on the balcony, like Tiger.

1327
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,232
But he's fat. Falls faster.
That's why.

1328
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,749
I'm tryin' to watch my weight,
and look what happens.

1329
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:00,549
<i>Goddam, that's hot!</i>

1330
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:03,752
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1331
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,474
You can't kill me,
duck-ass kids!

1332
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,036
Oh, yeah.

1333
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:14,312
Ooh. Look at that.
Look at that.

1334
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:18,638
Look at that.
Hey, isn't that beautiful?

1335
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,274
Isn't that beautiful?

1336
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,918
Oh, when the fires
start to fall,

1337
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,998
them that's strongest
rule it all!

1338
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,917
Oh!

1339
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:37,158
I love this city!

1340
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,036
Good thing we clipped you in,
huh, Frank?

1341
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,991
What about me?
Who buckled me in?

1342
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,917
- I thought you did.
- Nah, I thought you did.

1343
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:07,837
- I'm sorry about that, sir.
- Yeah, right.

1344
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,793
<i>Aah!</i>
<i>Stop jerkin' my pole!</i>

1345
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,794
<i>I-I got a fence up my ass, all</i>
<i>right? I need something for the pain.</i>

1346
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,717
<i>We'll get you another sedative.</i>

1347
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,798
<i>And somebody'll be by to take you to the</i>
<i>O.R., hopefully sometime this morning.</i>

1348
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,911
<i>Hopefully?</i>
<i>Hopefully sometime this morning?</i>

1349
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,679
<i>Oh, Frank.</i>
<i>Frank. Psst.</i>

1350
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,557
You saved my life.

1351
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,431
Yeah, I know.

1352
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,154
<i>Nurse Crupp, we're gonna need</i>
<i>some Valium here. He's waking up again.</i>

1353
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,794
- Where's that Valium?
<i>- Coming.</i>

1354
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:45,277
Frank, give me a hand over here.
I gotta get something between his teeth.

1355
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,790
<i>- Don't! Don't do it!</i>
- Valium's in.

1356
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,517
How many times
have you shocked him tonight?

1357
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,871
Fourteen. Finally got him
a room up in I.C.U.

1358
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,275
He should be up there
in a couple hours.

1359
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,598
What are you gonna do,
just have somebody follow him
around with a defibrillator?

1360
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:06,393
That's a good one, Frank. No,
but we might surgically implant one...

1361
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,431
around the shoulder over here,
'bout the size of my thumb.

1362
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,949
Two electrodes
connected to the heart.

1363
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,877
Sends a shock
whenever he needs it.

1364
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,357
Or we could just send him home with a
defibrillator. He could do it himself.

1365
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,354
Look.

1366
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:49,349
Last night I was weak,
and it won't happen again.

1367
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:54,076
All that shit I was sayin'
was just 'cause I was stoned.

1368
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,951
- Just forget it.
- No problem.

1369
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,229
Thanks for letting me crash.

1370
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,033
It was the best sleep
I've had in months.

1371
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,277
I used some of your soap.

1372
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,630
<i>Did you see my father?</i>

1373
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,316
You know, the doctor said
that, uh,

1374
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,795
that his brain's
startin' to come around.

1375
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,957
They're just waitin' for
his heart to stabilize.

1376
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,436
<i>I don't know who to believe.</i>

1377
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,358
Can I bring you back
something to eat?

1378
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,789
A falafel
or some pizza?

1379
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,474
No, we just ate.

1380
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,229
<i>I keep thinking about</i>
<i>how tough my father was.</i>

1381
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:40,636
Now I know
he had to be like that...

1382
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,557
to make us tough.

1383
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,230
'Cause this city,

1384
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,349
it'll kill you
if you aren't strong enough.

1385
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,389
No, the city
doesn't discriminate.

1386
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,910
It gets everybody.

1387
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,352
I gotta go.
Another call.

1388
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,232
We're all dying,
Mary Burke.

1389
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,675
<i>Get ready, Frank.</i>

1390
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,598
Missed a drug shooting while you were
dicking around in there.

1391
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,517
Gonna be trauma tonight, baby.

1392
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,676
As long as we keep moving.
No standing still.

1393
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,675
Look at your screen!
Give us some blood!

1394
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,756
<i>66-Xray, a man</i>
<i>at the bus terminal...</i>

1395
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,519
<i>shot three years ago</i>
<i>says his arm hurts.</i>

1396
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,269
Come on, Tom.
Pick up a job.

1397
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:31,119
You want some bum in the bus terminal?
We'll wait for a real call.

1398
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,196
- Let's get in a fight then.
That's your job.
- Who with?

1399
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,790
Just keep driving. Keep moving.
No stopping. We're sharks.
We stop too long, we die.

1400
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:42,157
Let's break something, Tom. Let's
bust something! Let's bomb something!

1401
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:44,589
- What do you wanna break?
- I don't know.
Let's break some windows!

1402
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,075
- Why?
- Destruction! Distraction!
I feel the need!

1403
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,078
You need a reason, Frank. You just don't
go around breaking people's windows.

1404
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,078
- That's anarchy.
- What's the reason, Tom?
Give me a reason.

1405
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,953
All right, let me think.
Oh, look at this.

1406
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:59,197
Classic cabby move.
Hey, swami!

1407
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,232
It's called a crosswalk! You're
supposed to stop before it, not on it!

1408
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:05,636
<i>You Senegalian raghead!</i>
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

1409
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:20,154
I know who to work over.

1410
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,556
Him!

1411
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:28,559
<i>This guy's been terrorizin'</i>
<i>the neighborhood for weeks,</i>

1412
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:31,319
ever since he got out of jail,
wreaking general havoc,

1413
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,237
contributing to
the bad name of the place.

1414
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:37,273
<i>You know, the term "menace to society"</i>
<i>was made up for him!</i>

1415
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,549
- He's crazy. He can't help it.
- Oh, yeah?

1416
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,274
Well, why don't they
put him away?

1417
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,755
Prisons don't want him.

1418
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,156
I took him to the hospital yesterday.
I gave him a cup of water.

1419
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,350
I was very nice to him.
And here he is again.

1420
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,835
<i>Oh! Look at that!</i>

1421
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,951
Tell me
that's a crazy person.

1422
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,275
Huh? Every move
is calculated!

1423
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,119
He knows exactly
what he is doing.

1424
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:05,198
Frank,
this is the guy.

1425
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,880
I've been after him for weeks.
He's quick, though.

1426
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,719
He runs like a rat.
He'd be tough for one person.

1427
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,400
- But with the two of us, you know...
- Okay, what do I do?

1428
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,351
Okay, I'm gonna
get out here.

1429
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,948
If he sees me, he'll run.
He doesn't like me.

1430
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,878
You start talkin' to him
about baseball or something.

1431
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,434
I'll sneak around behind him
and get down,

1432
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,357
and then you push him.

1433
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,869
And when he falls,
we get him.

1434
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,073
- That's ridiculous.
- Believe me, it always works.
The simpler, the better.

1435
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:35,192
Okay?

1436
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,356
<i>Havin' fun now!</i>

1437
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:46,956
That's a hell of a swing
you got there, Noel.

1438
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,799
- I'm thinking Mattingly in his prime.
- Mattingly ain't shit.

1439
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,434
Me, I swing like Reggie.

1440
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,676
Huh? Mr. October,
number three.

1441
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,597
Game six
of the World Series.

1442
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,517
All right!

1443
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,313
You hit it.
Come on, take a crack at it.

1444
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,237
It's okay.

1445
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:07,630
Come on, hit it!

1446
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,558
I better not.

1447
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,875
Go ahead.
Give it a go.

1448
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,116
Try it.

1449
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,071
Yeah?

1450
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,114
Okay.
What the hell.

1451
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:26,233
The next year, tiebreaker
for the division in Boston.

1452
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:30,114
<i>The Yanks down two to nothing.</i>
<i>Bucky Dent steps to the plate.</i>

1453
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,390
- Lucky-Fucky-Bucky, man.
- The pitch: high heater.

1454
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:35,318
Bucky knows what's comin'.
He steps in.

1455
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:39,399
Smash! Over the Green Monster!
Yeah!

1456
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,956
Frank!
What the...

1457
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:46,277
<i>What the hell are you doin'?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

1458
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,473
Now get down those stairs
and go after him!

1459
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,830
You meet me back here in ten minutes
if you can't find him.

1460
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,554
<i>Call out if you see him!</i>
<i>Remember, he runs like a rat!</i>

1461
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:59,673
Come on, Frank!
Get with the programme, man!

1462
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:48,192
<i>Why did you kill me, Frank?</i>

1463
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:53,559
I didn't mean to.

1464
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,875
<i>You should've helped me.</i>

1465
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,754
I tried to help.
I wanted to.

1466
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:06,557
Rose?

1467
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:09,956
<i>- Don't you love me?</i>
- Rose.

1468
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,316
Rose?

1469
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:27,277
To the moon, Alice!
Little motherfucker!

1470
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:32,517
- Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
- What the fuck?

1471
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,631
- Get the kit!
- Frank!

1472
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,990
You're gonna be all right, Noel.
We're gonna save you. Do it, Tom!

1473
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:39,270
I'll call for fuckin' backup!
I swear!

1474
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,439
You'd call for fuckin' backup?
Fuck you!

1475
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,477
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.

1476
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,112
<i>Let him through!</i>

1477
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,715
Let him through.
Bring him through.

1478
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,229
Who got that funky
motherfucker this time?

1479
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,555
Last show of the night.

1480
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:35,717
<i>What do you got?</i>
<i>What... Oh, boy.</i>

1481
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,718
- Oh, boy. Nurse Crupp!
Anybody else hurt?
- No.

1482
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:40,637
Get him over by
the counter over there.

1483
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,593
- All right, we're gonna need
an X ray for a C-spine.
- Got it.

1484
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:46,154
I'm gonna need
respiratory down here.

1485
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:48,953
<i>Crazy bastard.</i>
<i>At least he's intubated.</i>

1486
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,196
<i>- Won't hear him screamin' tonight.</i>
<i>- People, hear me out.</i>

1487
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:55,313
<i>Now, the path to your well-being and</i>
<i>salvation will not be over Griss' body.</i>

1488
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:58,876
<i>You can forget about that,</i>
<i>'cause Griss gets off in 47 minutes.</i>

1489
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,594
Then he's goin' home to take a bath.
Nice warm bath...

1490
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,551
Nurse Crupp, I'm gonna need
another line here.

1491
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:06,558
<i>Fine. One second. Here you are.</i>

1492
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,672
Notify CAT scan. We're gonna need
a C.T. right away. Welcome home, buddy.

1493
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:13,315
<i>Oh, look who we have. You're</i>
<i>gonna have to start paying rent here.</i>

1494
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,237
<i>- Where are you puttin' him?</i>
<i>- Three.</i>

1495
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,669
<i>Give me some gloves, please.</i>
<i>Nurse, call CAT scan.</i>

1496
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:20,439
- Tell 'em we'll be there
in a couple minutes.
- I got it.

1497
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:42,394
Is Patrick Burke here?
I brought him in.

1498
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:17,593
<i>- Frank?</i>
- Yes?

1499
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:20,712
<i>Where have you been?</i>

1500
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,597
What is it?

1501
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,877
<i>Let me go.</i>

1502
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,597
Code!

1503
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,875
<i>- What's this?</i>
<i>- He just coded.</i>

1504
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,116
<i>- What a way to begin the day.</i>
<i>Are we doing C.P. R?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

1505
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:25,117
<i>One mil epi.</i>
<i>Let me see this.</i>

1506
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:28,312
<i>- Is this the man who was down</i>
<i>in the E.R. for so long?</i>
<i>- Yes, it is.</i>

1507
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:30,829
<i>Seventeen codes.</i>
<i>My God.</i>

1508
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,520
<i>- Who's this man?</i>
<i>- He says he's the one</i>
<i>who brought him in.</i>

1509
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:35,278
The family?

1510
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:38,119
<i>Seventeen codes.</i>

1511
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:40,356
<i>Well, they must be prepared.</i>

1512
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,391
You know how they can be.

1513
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,351
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1514
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,917
Okay, stop C.P.R.

1515
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,517
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>I'm calling it. 6:02.</i>

1516
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,996
<i>Are you gonna</i>
<i>tell the family?</i>

1517
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,633
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

1518
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:20,230
Son of a bitch!
Die! Die!

1519
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:23,113
<i>Die! Die!</i>
<i>Die! Die!</i>

1520
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:25,834
<i>Bastard!</i>

1521
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,718
Who is it?

1522
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:39,229
- Frank.
- Oh, come on up.

1523
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:51,517
Hi.

1524
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,516
He's dead, Mary.

1525
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:57,995
Your father passed.

1526
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,836
They just moved him
to the second floor, to I.C.U.

1527
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,110
He coded.

1528
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:09,869
They shocked him too many times.
I'm sorry.

1529
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:19,757
I don't know how he held on
as long as he did.

1530
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,038
I'm sorry.

1531
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:31,354
You have to keep
the body going...

1532
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:35,109
until the brain and heart
recover enough to go on their own.

1533
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:46,074
Forgive me, Rose.

1534
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:51,031
It's not your fault.

1535
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:54,232
No one asked you to suffer.

1536
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,794
That was your idea.

1537
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,275
Noel was almost killed.

1538
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,516
I took care of him.

1539
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:13,915
He's gonna pull through.

1540
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,997
Would you like to come in?

1541
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:22,315
Yes.
