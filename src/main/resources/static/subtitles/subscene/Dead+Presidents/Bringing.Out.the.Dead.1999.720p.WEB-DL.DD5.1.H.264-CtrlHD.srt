1
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,742
<i>The night started out with a bang.</i>

2
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:25,543
<i>A gunshot to the chest</i>
<i>on a drug deal gone bad.</i>

3
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:28,794
<i>All the elements were in place</i>
<i>for a long weekend...</i>

4
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:31,926
<i>heat, humidity, moonlight.</i>

5
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,963
<i>I was good at my job.</i>

6
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:38,426
<i>There were periods when my hands moved</i>
<i>with a speed and skill beyond me.</i>

7
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,561
<i>But in the last year,</i>
<i>I started to lose that control.</i>

8
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:44,013
<i>Things had turned bad.</i>

9
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:46,687
<i>I hadn't saved anyone in months.</i>

10
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,567
<i>I just needed a few slow nights,</i>
<i>followed by a couple of days off.</i>

11
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:52,654
<i>- Ladder Four.</i>
- We're there.

12
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:57,574
<i>Respond to a 10-22.</i>
<i>Four-flight residential. 417 West 32.</i>

13
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:00,871
<i>77-David at 177 West 24.</i>

14
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,834
<i>There's a woman who says a roach</i>
<i>crawled in her ear. Can't get it out.</i>

15
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,834
<i>Says she's going</i>
<i>into cardiac arrest.</i>

16
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:08,963
<i>63-Boy, men's room, Grand Central.</i>
<i>Man set his pants on fire.</i>

17
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,415
<i>- Bad burns.</i>
- Move back.
- Which apartment?

18
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,338
- 5-A.
- Oh, Jesus, it's Mr. Burke.

19
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:18,378
<i>Why is it always the top floor?</i>

20
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:20,389
<i>Goddam.</i>

21
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,722
<i>No! No!</i>

22
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,440
<i>No! No!</i>

23
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:38,151
<i>No! No!</i>

24
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,618
Oh, God, they're here.

25
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:45,954
Shh, shh. Over there.

26
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,621
Mary, it's two hands.
It's my dad.

27
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,458
We were just watching TV,
and he was sort of punching his chest...

28
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:54,626
- Step outside.
- Next thing,
he locks himself in the bathroom.

29
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,633
So I told him I was gonna
call you guys, and he said not to.

30
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,968
- How long ago did he stop breathing?
- I don't know. Ten minutes.

31
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:02,381
Twenty. A woman on the phone
tried to tell us how to do C.P.R.

32
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:04,805
- Could you do something?
- We'll do what we can.

33
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:07,557
<i>He was cryin'.</i>
<i>I never heard him cryin' before.</i>

34
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,788
I need you to squeeze this
once every three seconds.

35
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:40,124
Clear! Clear!

36
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:45,172
- Ma'am, I need you to step back.
- Clear! Clear!

37
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:47,799
No more. Please don't.

38
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,771
- Clear! Clear!
- Ma'am, step back.

39
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:54,478
Daddy.

40
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,160
<i>In the last year,</i>
<i>I'd come to believe in such things...</i>

41
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:16,706
<i>as spirits leaving the body</i>
<i>and not wanting to be put back.</i>

42
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,132
<i>Spirits angry at the awkward places</i>
<i>death had left them.</i>

43
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:25,838
<i>I understood how crazy it was</i>
<i>to think this way.</i>

44
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:29,223
<i>But I was convinced</i>
<i>that if I turned around,</i>

45
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,722
<i>I'd see old man Burke...</i>

46
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,426
<i>standing at the window,</i>

47
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:36,472
<i>watching,</i>

48
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,932
<i>waiting for us to finish.</i>

49
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:48,783
I'll take over.
Call E.R. and ask for an 83.

50
00:05:58,045 --> 00:05:59,953
Sorry.

51
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:16,515
Do you have any music?

52
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,682
- What?
<i>- Music.</i>

53
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:23,434
<i>I think it helps if you play</i>
<i>something he liked.</i>

54
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:27,363
John.

55
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,484
Play the Sinatra.

56
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:32,618
- What?
- Play the Sinatra.

57
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:34,868
What is it, Johnny?

58
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,970
Okay, Frank, you can call it. 83.

59
00:06:58,104 --> 00:07:02,646
- No, we can't. He's got a pulse.
<i>- No shit?</i>

60
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:06,274
Is he gonna be all right?

61
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:10,400
His heart's beating.
Have 'em bring up a board.

62
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:24,289
No, no. No. No.

63
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,291
Help your family.
Ride with your mother and brother.

64
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:31,124
Help your family.
They need you more. Help yourself.

65
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,202
For the family.

66
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:08,665
<i>I had to concentrate</i>
<i>to keep my mind from wandering off...</i>

67
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:10,670
<i>on these short trips.</i>

68
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,171
<i>It was the neighborhood</i>
<i>I grew up in...</i>

69
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:16,337
<i>and where I'd worked most</i>
<i>as a paramedic.</i>

70
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,800
<i>And it held more ghosts</i>
<i>per square foot than any other.</i>

71
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:48,574
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

72
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,079
<i>Hey, partner.</i>
<i>Your man doesn't look well.</i>
<i>They not gonna appreciate you inside.</i>

73
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:55,250
- Nobody loves me, Griss.
- Hey, Griss just tellin' you
things are backing up.

74
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,423
Griss, let us in.

75
00:08:57,552 --> 00:08:59,545
Whatever you say.

76
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,217
Oh, my foot!

77
00:09:02,348 --> 00:09:05,682
Don't even slow down.
Just keep on moving.

78
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,939
<i>Sir, you say you've been snorting</i>
<i>cocaine for three days...</i>

79
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:13,019
and now you feel as if your heart
is beating too fast...

80
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,943
and you would like
for us to help you.

81
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,071
To tell you the truth,
I don't see why we should.

82
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:20,770
Correct me if I am wrong here,
if I'm mistaken.

83
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:23,445
Did we sell you the cocaine?
Did we push it up your nose?

84
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:26,993
- Oh, come on.
- For Christ sakes,
can I please get a cup of water?

85
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:30,538
- Shut up, goddam civilian!
- All I want is a cup of water!

86
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,874
<i>Oh, no. No, no,</i>
<i>no, no, no, guys.</i>

87
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:36,207
We're on diversion here.
We're not accepting any more patients.

88
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:39,542
<i>The dispatcher should've let you</i>
<i>know that, Frank. I cannot do it. No.</i>

89
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:41,467
We picked him up at 49th and 10th.
You're the closest.

90
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,468
Where do you want me to put him?
You tell me.

91
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:46,681
He wanted to come here. He said that
the nurses at Misery were the best.

92
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:51,270
- All I want is a cup of water!
- All right, fine.
I'll kick someone out of bed three.

93
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:54,149
Excuse me.
You're a kind man, I can see that.

94
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:57,358
A man like you's not gonna deny a poor,
sick, dying, helpless man...

95
00:09:57,485 --> 00:10:00,320
- a small cup of water.
- I can't.
I have to stay with my patient.

96
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,652
Will you shut the fuck up?

97
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:07,195
Goddam it. What the hell are you doing
to me? We're all backed up in here.

98
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,662
Jesus Christ, look at this guy.
Looks like he needs the works.
What's wrong with him?

99
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,159
- You should know. You pronounced him.
- You told me he was dead.

100
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:16,167
- Flatline.
- He got better.

101
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:18,454
I hate pronouncing
people dead over the phone.

102
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,837
Yeah. Better, huh? They're fixed
and dilated. This guy's plant food.

103
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:26,551
Hey, we stole a stretcher from X ray, so
put him in three next to the overdose.

104
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:29,433
All right, look. He's our lowest
priority now. He shouldn't even be here.

105
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,800
<i>All this technology.</i>
<i>What a waste.</i>

106
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:34,639
<i>Leave that dope alone.</i>
<i>The doc'll be out in a minute.</i>

107
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,476
- Sir, is there some way we could
find out what's going on?
- Please, folks, step back.

108
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:41,605
Please, folks, step back.
I've already told you two to step back.

109
00:10:41,737 --> 00:10:44,691
- Mister...
- Now, look, don't make me
take off my sunglasses.

110
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:48,951
First-time heart attack, age 45. He
should've gone to C.C.U. ten hours ago.

111
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:51,284
<i>We got three bodies up there</i>
<i>just like the one you brought in.</i>

112
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:54,781
Over there, two AIDS patients.
One is 12 and filling up with fluids.

113
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,873
<i>Mother won't sign</i>
<i>the "Do Not Resuscitate."</i>

114
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,707
<i>Mercy killing doesn't</i>
<i>translate well in Spanish.</i>

115
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:02,294
It's a sin
to have to tube that kid.

116
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:05,508
<i>We got three more O.D.s from this new</i>
<i>killerjunk they're calling Red Death.</i>

117
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:07,877
<i>What's in it?</i>

118
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:10,384
It's a mix of heroin and I don't know
what else. An amino acid, maybe.

119
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:12,506
<i>This stuff is so strong,</i>
<i>they're drinking it with grain alcohol.</i>

120
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:14,799
<i>You need ten times</i>
<i>the usual amount of Narcan.</i>

121
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,058
And when they wake up, watch out
'cause they're liable to go nuts on you.

122
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:21,351
- He one of 'em?
<i>- No, that's Noel.</i>
<i>He used to be a regular off and on.</i>

123
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,358
I haven't seen him for a while.
He seized and almost coded.

124
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:25,360
I gave him
a hypertonic solution.

125
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:27,362
He drank so much
his kidneys were taking out salt.

126
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,490
- That's one for the textbooks.
- Doc, you're the greatest.

127
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:33,867
- You gotta help me.
- Can you give this guy a drink of water?

128
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,534
Noel, I am helping you. You drink
any more water, you could die!

129
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,657
<i>Hazmat, three's coding.</i>
<i>We got a flatline here.</i>

130
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:43,204
<i>Start C.P.R. Milagros, get me an epi.</i>
<i>Odette, wake up Dr. Starks.</i>

131
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:46,209
<i>Tell him we're gonna need him stat.</i>
<i>400 joules. Clear!</i>

132
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,755
You want water?
I'll give you water.

133
00:11:49,886 --> 00:11:52,555
- What a pain in the ass.
Just get out of here.
<i>- 600 joules.</i>

134
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:55,930
<i>- Clear!</i>
<i>- So you get drunk</i>
<i>every day and you fall down.</i>

135
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:59,677
<i>Well, why should we help you?</i>
<i>You’re just gonna get drunk</i>
<i>tomorrow, fall down again.</i>

136
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,686
<i>Griss, this man</i>
<i>wants to leave.</i>

137
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:12,479
- Thank you.
- I know him. That's Noel.

138
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:15,238
You better step outside.
Quickly.

139
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,623
- Get...
- Fuck!

140
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:28,371
Noel? Noel.

141
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:33,876
It's... It's me.
It's Mary Burke from 49th Street.

142
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:36,301
Oh, Mary.

143
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:40,974
Oh, Mary, I'm so thirsty. They won't
give me any water to drink in there.

144
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:43,309
- Please.
- I'll get you some.

145
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,313
I wouldn't do that.

146
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,025
The doctor seems to think he's suffering
from some rare disorder.

147
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:02,154
He's had a rough life.
He grew up on our street.

148
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,447
He's a little crazy from it,
but that's no excuse...

149
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,166
<i>for not giving somebody</i>
<i>a lousy cup of water.</i>

150
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:16,092
Here.

151
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:23,309
My father's dying, Noel.

152
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,897
Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary.

153
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,441
<i>Oh.</i>

154
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:57,876
<i>Chinese closes in five minutes.</i>

155
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,837
Beef lo mein. Been on my mind
since I awoke. What do you think?

156
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:06,223
I think the moment that food
hits your mouth, we'll get a run.

157
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:09,387
Turn here. You missed it.
Chink's on 11th.

158
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:23,239
Oh, finally. Where you been?

159
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:28,621
<i>Hey, ambulance man,</i>
<i>what you looking at?</i>

160
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:35,082
Yeah, pretty soon
you'll be coming for me.

161
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:37,537
Do you think he'll come for me?

162
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:48,673
Pretty soon
you'll be coming for me.

163
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,597
Boy, some partner you are, Frank.
I could've walked there faster.

164
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,774
I'm starving, and you stop to talk
to hookers. You're making me nuts.

165
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,770
Is that what you're trying to do?
Drag me down to Nutsville with you?

166
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:16,416
- Oh, no!
- What?

167
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:19,545
I just remembered. I'm so stupid.
I had beef lo mein last night.

168
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:22,342
I can't eat the same thing
two nights in a row.

169
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,717
It's almost 2:00. What the hell am
I gonna do? What are you getting?

170
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:28,681
- I'm not hungry.
- Yeah, you don't eat food.

171
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:30,966
I eat.

172
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:34,967
Larry, I eat.
Just haven't had coffee yet.

173
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:38,390
Only coffee and whisky.
Lucky you ain't dead with that diet.

174
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:40,563
I got it.

175
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:44,311
Half fried chicken
and fries. Let's go.

176
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,345
<i>Rose's ghost was getting closer.</i>

177
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:19,015
<i>It had been six months since I lost her.</i>
<i>A homeless girl,</i>

178
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:22,599
<i>asthmatic, 18 years old.</i>

179
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,856
<i>I used to block</i>
<i>the bad calls out.</i>

180
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:29,528
<i>I used to forget,</i>
<i>but she wouldn't let go.</i>

181
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:32,942
<i>And now she'd come</i>
<i>to bear witness for all of them,</i>

182
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,615
<i>all that had been lost.</i>

183
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:40,370
<i>These spirits</i>
<i>were part of the job.</i>

184
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:44,333
<i>It was impossible to pass a building</i>
<i>that didn't hold a ghost of something.</i>

185
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:48,210
<i>The eyes of a corpse.</i>
<i>The screams of a loved one.</i>

186
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,544
<i>All bodies leave their mark.</i>

187
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,545
<i>You cannot be near the newly dead</i>
<i>without feeling it.</i>

188
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,058
<i>I could handle that.</i>

189
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,891
<i>What haunted me now</i>
<i>was more savage.</i>

190
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,980
<i>Spirits born half-finished.</i>

191
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:07,311
<i>Homicides.</i>
<i>Suicides. Overdoses.</i>

192
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,895
<i>Accusing me of being there,</i>
<i>witnessing a humiliation,</i>

193
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,403
<i>which they</i>
<i>could never forgive.</i>

194
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,069
Turn it off.

195
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,658
- What?
- You know what. The radio.

196
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,078
That's not the police band. It's your
fire department scanner in your bag.

197
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,419
- Oh.
Ladder Four, respond to a 10-22.

198
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,087
<i>Six-flight residential.</i>
<i>534 West 32.</i>

199
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,049
- Let's do it.
It might be a good one.
- There are no good fires.

200
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,178
People die in fires. People get burned
up in fires. People can't breathe.

201
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,180
That's what we're here for.
Let's go.

202
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,229
- 63...
- Don't push it, Larry.

203
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,682
- Oh, you're burned out, man.
You're scorched.
- Not yet, Larry.

204
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,771
I'm still burning. If you get
any closer, I'm gonna put a burn on you.

205
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:57,063
<i>6-3 Zebra. 6-3 Zebra.</i>
<i>Zebra three, I need you.</i>

206
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,240
- You see? He's giving it to us anyway.
<i>- Zebra, are you there?</i>

207
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,698
<i>- I'm holding</i>
<i>an unconscious at 9th and 41st.</i>
<i>- No, no, no!</i>

208
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:06,951
<i>3:00 in the morning.</i>
<i>That can only mean one thing.</i>

209
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,124
- Mr. Oh.
- Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.

210
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,294
Answer the radio, Zebra.
You know it's that time.

211
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,792
Four times this week I've had him.
Aren't there any other units out there?

212
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,464
- Zebra, are you there?
<i>- Don't answer it.</i>
<i>They'll get somebody else.</i>

213
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:21,295
63-Zebra, answer me now, or I'm sending
a captain to your location.

214
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:25,595
Frank,
when I say don't answer it, that means
answer it. You could do me that favor.

215
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:27,637
<i>- 6-3 Zebra.</i>
<i>- Yes, Zebra, you'll be driving...</i>

216
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,978
<i>to the man who needs no introduction.</i>

217
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:33,108
<i>Chronic caller of the year, three</i>
<i>straight and shooting for number four,</i>

218
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:35,987
<i>the duke of drunk,</i>
<i>the king of stink,</i>

219
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:39,281
<i>- our most frequent flyer, Mr. Oh.</i>
- 10-4.

220
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,945
<i>Don't do it.</i>
<i>Not this time...</i>

221
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:45,327
<i>Relax. It's a street job.</i>
<i>It's easy except for the smell.</i>

222
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:48,373
We just throw him in the back,
zip over to Mercy.

223
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,450
No blood, no dying. That's how
I look at it. He's just a drunk.

224
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:54,462
It's not our job
to taxi drunks around.

225
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,163
Yeah, but they're just
gonna keep calling.

226
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,585
Someone's gonna have a cardiac,
and the only medics will
be taking care of Mr. Oh.

227
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,384
<i>He's bad, mister.</i>
<i>He ain't eaten nothing all day.</i>

228
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,389
<i>And he's seizing</i>
<i>and throwing up.</i>

229
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:08,806
- So, what's different about him today?
- He says his feet hurt.

230
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:13,812
- Oh, why didn't you say so?
<i>- I can't find a pulse,</i>
<i>but he's still breathing.</i>

231
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,350
Well, it looks like we're just in time.
Step aside, sir.

232
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:19,237
- He's drunk.
<i>- He's sick. You gotta help him.</i>

233
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:21,237
He's fine.
He can walk to the hospital.

234
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:23,738
Walk? Are you crazy?
He's in the wheelchair.

235
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:26,405
Oh, don't give me that.
He walks better than I do.

236
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:30,534
Oh! Oh! That's right, Mr. Oh.

237
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:33,785
Come on, buddy. Your limo's here.

238
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,789
- Get better.
- Good luck, old buddy.

239
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:46,385
Oh!

240
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:49,718
- Faster! Come on, Frank. Faster!
<i>- Faster?</i>

241
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:53,055
You want faster?

242
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:59,316
Oh, no.
Take that stinky-ass motherfucking
bug-ridden skell out of my face!

243
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,401
Johnny, welcome back.
Good to see ya.

244
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,736
And my conscience simply
will not allow that.

245
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:06,106
Griss, this gentleman
would like to leave.

246
00:20:06,242 --> 00:20:08,912
Oh! He looks so pale.

247
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:12,322
Hey, you getting enough to eat?
You getting your fiber?

248
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:14,614
Wasted. That's my diagnosis.
He's shit-faced.

249
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:18,201
He just needs a bath and some food.
Let's take him in back.

250
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:21,089
<i>- Get a stretcher.</i>
- She's nuts. That's why he comes here.

251
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:23,457
- She encourages him.
- Don't you dare.
This is not a homeless shelter.

252
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:25,965
- He's gonna have to wait in the lobby.
- No way, man.

253
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:28,421
Not even in the corner.
Griss cannot abide the funk tonight.

254
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:31,226
Senor. Senor.

255
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:54,401
My first cigarette
in over a year.

256
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:57,076
First is always the best.

257
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,964
The doctor doesn't think
my father will make it.

258
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,044
Said he was dead for too long.

259
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:09,797
After six minutes,
the brain starts to die,

260
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:12,680
and after that,

261
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:15,677
just close the door.

262
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,478
You never know.

263
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:22,103
You know, my father and I
haven't spoken in three years.

264
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:26,313
When my brother called me and said
that my father had a heart attack...

265
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:30,109
and that he locked himself
in the bathroom,

266
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,158
all the way going over there,
I was thinking of...

267
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:36,203
how I was gonna tell him
what a bastard he was.

268
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,454
When I got there
and we put him up on the bed,

269
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:46,922
and I thought of all the other things
that I wanted to say to him...

270
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:56,346
Well, right now I'm more worried
about my mother than anything.

271
00:21:56,474 --> 00:22:00,342
Go home. Take her home.
Get some rest.

272
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:04,178
- You're not gonna
find anything out now.
- That's what I told her.

273
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:08,015
If she could just see him for a second,
then I know she'd let me take her home.

274
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:10,144
Thanks for the light.

275
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,114
Here's your dinner.
I wheel, you heal.

276
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,536
<i>6-2 David, at 38th and 2,</i>
<i>you'll find a three-car accident.</i>

277
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:21,703
<i>Two taxis and a taxi.</i>

278
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:25,199
<i>6- 2 Henry, 6-2 Henry.</i>
<i>487 West 22.</i>

279
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:28,086
<i>Report of a very bad smell.</i>
<i>No further information.</i>

280
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:30,121
Larry, swing over to 10th. We're gonna
have to run one of these calls.

281
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:32,628
Relax, will ya?

282
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,384
<i>The biggest problem with not driving...</i>

283
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:40,096
<i>is that whenever there's a patient</i>
<i>in the back, you're also in the back.</i>

284
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,724
<i>The door's closed. You're trapped.</i>

285
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:48,728
<i>5:00 or 6:00 in the morning is always</i>
<i>the worst time for me. Just before dawn.</i>

286
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:50,732
<i>Just when you've been</i>
<i>lulled into thinking...</i>

287
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,228
<i>it might be safe to close</i>
<i>your eyes for one minute.</i>

288
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:56,854
<i>That's when</i>
<i>I first found Rose.</i>

289
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:01,320
<i>She was on the sidewalk,</i>
<i>not breathing.</i>

290
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:06,785
I'm not feeling very well, Larry.

291
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:09,918
Let's say we go back
to the hospital, call it a night.

292
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:14,422
You got no sick time, Frank. No time
of any kind. Everyone knows that.

293
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,255
Take me back.
Put me to bed. I surrender.

294
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,260
We've done
enough damage tonight.

295
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:21,843
You take things way
too seriously, Frank.

296
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,936
<i>You ever think</i>
<i>of doing anything else?</i>

297
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,054
<i>Sure.</i>

298
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,224
Taking my captain's
exam next year.

299
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,812
Once the kids are in school,
Louise can go back to the post office.

300
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:40,651
I thought, "What the hell?
I'll start my own medic service."

301
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:44,733
Out on the island, the volunteers
are becoming salaried municipal.

302
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,454
It's just a matter of time
and who you know.

303
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:53,210
Someday it's gonna be
Chief Larry calling the shots.

304
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,758
<i>I'd always had nightmares.</i>

305
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:14,728
<i>But now the ghosts</i>
<i>didn't wait for me to sleep.</i>

306
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,775
<i>I drank every day.</i>

307
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:20,274
<i>"Help others</i>
<i>and you help yourself."</i>

308
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:22,978
<i>That was my motto.</i>

309
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:26,070
<i>But I hadn't saved</i>
<i>anyone in months.</i>

310
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:29,073
<i>It seemed all my patients</i>
<i>were dying on me.</i>

311
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,993
<i>I'd waited,</i>
<i>sure the sickness would break.</i>

312
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:36,833
<i>Maybe the next call, maybe tomorrow,</i>
<i>the feeling would drop away.</i>

313
00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:41,256
<i>More than anything else,</i>
<i>I wanted to sleep like that.</i>

314
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:44,669
<i>Close my eyes</i>
<i>and drift away.</i>

315
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:51,843
<i>Zebra. 6-3 Zebra.</i>

316
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:56,187
<i>Zebra.</i>

317
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:00,354
Zebra, answer the radio.
Come on. I got one for you.

318
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:04,982
<i>Pick up the radio and push the button</i>
<i>on the side and speak into the front.</i>

319
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:09,952
<i>Come on. Zebra?</i>

320
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:20,537
- Zebra.
<i>- Suicidal male bleeding,</i>

321
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:23,210
<i>corner of 44th and 8th.</i>

322
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:25,796
<i>No further information.</i>

323
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:28,465
10-4.

324
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:34,719
<i>We have a call, Chief.</i>
<i>Somebody's bleeding. 44th and 8th.</i>

325
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:38,802
<i>No, no. Brake! Brake!</i>
<i>It's the water. Turn around.</i>

326
00:25:45,696 --> 00:25:49,906
<i>Come on. Kill me!</i>
<i>Push it in! Do it!</i>

327
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:54,576
Kill me! Huh? Come on.
Kill me. Just push it. Huh?

328
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:57,824
<i>I'm gonna cut</i>
<i>my throat, man.</i>

329
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,584
No, don't!
Drop the bottle.

330
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,957
- Put down the bottle.
<i>- He's crazy.</i>

331
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:11,089
Really? You look pretty thirsty,
Noel. You want some water?

332
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:16,965
See, I can't do it.
I came out of the desert.

333
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:19,259
Those people left me
in the sun to die.

334
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:21,269
You came out
of the hospital.

335
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:23,271
You were tied down
and hallucinating.

336
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:25,273
You got some bad
chemicals in your head.

337
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:28,271
- There's some medicine at
the hospital that'll fix that.
- No! No medicine.

338
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:31,440
- No medicine.
- He got ya.
<i>- Do it!</i>

339
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:35,867
<i>Man wants to die? I know how to kill</i>
<i>that mother. Pop, pop.</i>

340
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:41,118
- Oh, sh...
- Shit!

341
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:47,370
Noel! Noel!

342
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:51,040
<i>Noel!</i>
<i>Larry, call for backup.</i>

343
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:56,086
<i>6-3 Zebra,</i>
<i>10-85 forthwith, 44 and 8th.</i>

344
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:58,345
Get out of the road,
you crazy bastard!

345
00:26:58,474 --> 00:27:00,348
Noel, you didn't
let me finish.

346
00:27:00,477 --> 00:27:04,142
We have rules against killing people
on the street, okay? It looks bad.

347
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:07,142
There's a special room
at the hospital for terminating.

348
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:10,062
It's a nice quiet room
with a big bed.

349
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,271
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

350
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,908
Man, thank you, man.

351
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,572
Wait a minute. How?
How are you gonna kill me?

352
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:26,786
Well, you have a choice.
You can have pills, injection or gas.

353
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:30,620
- Pills. Definitely pills.
<i>- You fucking arsehole!</i>

354
00:27:46,438 --> 00:27:48,846
Tom Wolls,
that crazy motherfucker.

355
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,652
- He used to be my partner.
- Frank.

356
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,360
This the guy you called about?
I know you.

357
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,486
- Nah, you don't know me.
You don't know me.
- Oh, yes, I do, Pedro. I do.

358
00:28:00,618 --> 00:28:03,618
- I know you. I know him.
- I don't think so.

359
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:06,118
You give my friend here
any more trouble, I'll kill ya.

360
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:09,000
- Yeah, at the hospital.
- What?

361
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:11,000
At the hospital. He's gonna
kill me in the hospital.

362
00:28:11,128 --> 00:28:13,002
Forget the hospital.
I'll kill you here.

363
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:15,883
This looks like a very bad man
I took in a couple of weeks ago...

364
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:18,714
who'd been holding two priests...
not one, two priests...

365
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:21,382
<i>hostage with a screwdriver,</i>
<i>and I told him...</i>

366
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:23,720
if he was ever caught
making trouble again,

367
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,387
- I'd kick the murdering life out of him.
- It's not worth it, Tom.

368
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:29,722
- He's surrendering.
- What?

369
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:32,392
- The war's over.
- Not mine.

370
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:35,727
Hey, Pedro, come here,
you little motherfucker.

371
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:37,734
I just want to talk to you,

372
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:40,188
give you a little
psychological first aid.

373
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:43,111
I'm gonna give you your first lesson
on how to be an American.

374
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,450
It's called
"Eatin' My Shit."

375
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:48,070
<i>- Come here.</i>

376
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:51,409
Tom, don't do it,
Tom. Tom!

377
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:53,417
I have to take him
to the hospital.

378
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:57,708
- I have to get him to the hospital.
- Get up here, motherfucker!

379
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,500
- That's enough!
<i>- Take that!</i>

380
00:28:59,634 --> 00:29:03,003
<i>There's a double shooting three blocks</i>
<i>down. 41st and 8th, confirmed.</i>

381
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:06,008
We'll do that.
Larry. Larry. Larry!

382
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,759
- I'll take it. Motherfucker!
- That's enough.

383
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:13,512
I'll do that. I'll see you
over there, okay?

384
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:16,482
What happened?

385
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:24,733
Oh, man. Just walked up
and shot him. Not a word.

386
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:28,735
- Damn, that was cold.
- E.M.S. Move it.

387
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:31,030
Where are you hit?

388
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:34,449
You see this shit, man?
Niggas put a hole in me.

389
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:39,495
Yo, Tiger did this shit, yo.
And money right here work for Outlaw.

390
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:50,593
<i>- We got a gang war</i>
<i>about to start, yo.</i>
- Take a deep breath.

391
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:58,978
Major Tom! I'm going to Misery!
You take yours to Bellevue.

392
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:02,311
Okay, Frank, you take yours to heaven.
I'll take mine to hell. Let's go.

393
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:04,983
Get him on the board.
Let's go.

394
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:11,442
You're gonna feel a stick in your arm.
Don't move.

395
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,151
<i>Listen, I'm quitting, man.</i>

396
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:16,911
I'm going in the army
where it's safe.

397
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:19,330
I don't wanna die.

398
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,497
- No, I wanna die. I'm the one.
- You're not gonna die.

399
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:25,501
- What did you say?
- Shut up! You're going to die.
He's not. Got it?

400
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:29,335
<i>- Hold my hand, man.</i>
- I can't. I gotta do the other arm.

401
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:33,255
- Hold my hand, man.
- Hold this.

402
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:35,680
If you let go,
I swear I won't kill you.

403
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,107
It's all right. We're here.

404
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:56,867
Fuck.

405
00:30:56,998 --> 00:30:59,536
He's not breathing.
Call a code.

406
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,993
Noel, let's go.

407
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,963
<i>Let's go!</i>

408
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:08,706
Fucking Christ.

409
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,553
<i>So here I am. And this junkie</i>
<i>got something jammed in his teeth.</i>

410
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:18,886
<i>Now, none of these junkies wanna give</i>
<i>mouth-to-mouth. It was a blow dryer.</i>

411
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,305
<i>So I pulls it out.</i>
<i>His body was cold except for his throat.</i>

412
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:25,890
It had been blow-dried for an hour.
Junkie had second-degree burns
of the tongue.

413
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:28,313
Did you ever give mouth-to-mouth?

414
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:31,149
A long time ago,
when I was your age, boy. Never again.

415
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,365
Chances are you end up
with a mouthful of puke. Junkie puke.

416
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:38,407
I'd do it if I had to.
It's part of the job.

417
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:40,697
<i>- What about you?</i>
- What?

418
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,909
You ever do
mouth-to-mouth before?

419
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:46,246
- Once. On a baby.
<i>- Oh, babies.</i>

420
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:49,582
Now, babies are a whole
different thing entirely.

421
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:52,087
<i>Did I ever tell you about the time</i>
<i>that white woman approached me?</i>

422
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:55,800
<i>I said, "Ma'am, I'm a true cocksman,</i>
<i>and I don't mix my seed. "</i>

423
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:58,966
<i>Only time you see me with a white woman</i>
<i>when I'm holdin' her for the police. "</i>

424
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:01,638
<i>That's the truth.</i>

425
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:07,348
You shouldn't smoke.

426
00:32:09,151 --> 00:32:12,602
It's okay.
They're prescription.

427
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:15,359
Works better
with a little whisky.

428
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:20,112
Yeah, that was my brother's problem.
That's why he's passed out inside.

429
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:22,118
That's it!

430
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:26,031
I've had it!
Can't take it anymore.

431
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:34,706
- You got... blood on...
- I know.

432
00:32:37,094 --> 00:32:41,044
That boy you brought in,
he's, uh, shot, wasn't he?

433
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,055
<i>Yeah.</i>

434
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:46,725
He's dead, huh?

435
00:32:46,854 --> 00:32:48,763
Yes.

436
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,973
I think this place stinks.

437
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:56,645
- Our Lady of Misery.
<i>- It's crazy in there.</i>

438
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:58,655
What's the matter
with that doctor...

439
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:01,107
who keeps mumbling and poking himself
in the eye whenever he talks to me?

440
00:33:01,243 --> 00:33:03,650
He's working a double shift.

441
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:08,656
Well, my father's in there.
He's in a coma.

442
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:11,579
My mother,
she's... she's going crazy.

443
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:16,504
It's like, uh,
she's in a trance.

444
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:19,668
She should go home.

445
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:23,218
<i>Yeah, well, I'd take her,</i>
<i>but somebody's got to stay here.</i>

446
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:27,764
- Did you see him?
<i>- It wasn't him.</i>

447
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:29,768
<i>You saw him?</i>

448
00:33:29,896 --> 00:33:33,100
They showed me someone.
It wasn't him. It wasn't my husband.

449
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:36,187
Mrs. Burke, they'll take care of him.
You should go home now.

450
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,192
I should know my own husband.

451
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,194
They wouldn't let me see him.

452
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:43,026
Larry and I'll drop her home.
Help me get her to the ambulance.

453
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:46,527
Mom, they're gonna give you a ride home.
Come on. This way.

454
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:51,162
You want some coffee?

455
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:53,700
I have applesauce cake too.

456
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:57,039
- Right here. Right there.
- Oh.

457
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:59,165
Thanks.

458
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,873
I'll call you
if anything changes.

459
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:30,569
<i>Saving someone's</i>
<i>life is like falling in love.</i>

460
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,780
<i>The best drug in the world.</i>

461
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,079
<i>For days,</i>
<i>sometimes weeks afterwards,</i>

462
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:41,256
<i>you walk the street</i>
<i>making infinite whatever you see.</i>

463
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:47,297
<i>Once, for a few weeks,</i>
<i>I couldn't feel the earth.</i>

464
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,635
<i>Everything I touched</i>
<i>became lighter.</i>

465
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:54,260
<i>Horns played in my shoes.</i>
<i>Flowers fell from my pockets.</i>

466
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:56,967
<i>You wonder</i>
<i>if you've become immortal,</i>

467
00:34:57,105 --> 00:35:00,225
<i>as if you've saved</i>
<i>your own life as well.</i>

468
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:02,932
<i>God has passed through you.</i>

469
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,237
<i>Why deny it</i>
<i>that for a moment there...</i>

470
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:10,991
<i>Why deny for a moment there</i>
<i>God was you?</i>

471
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:19,459
<i>Taking credit when things go right</i>
<i>doesn't work the other way.</i>

472
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:24,793
<i>When things go wrong,</i>
<i>spreading the blame is an</i>
<i>essential medic survival tool.</i>

473
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:28,506
<i>"The elevator broke down."</i>
<i>"The boyfriend was crazy."</i>

474
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:32,301
<i>"I should've called in sick."</i>
<i>"The tube wouldn't go in."</i>

475
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:37,306
<i>The god of hellfire is not a role</i>
<i>that anyone wants to play.</i>

476
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,956
- Good morning, Captain.
- What am I gonna do with this guy?

477
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:12,132
Pierce, I just got off the phone
with Borough Command.

478
00:36:12,262 --> 00:36:16,342
Out of 12 shifts this month,
you've been late for nine, sick four.

479
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,012
That includes the shift where you
came in late, you went home early.

480
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,848
- I'm sick. That's what
I've been telling you.
<i>- You're sick?</i>

481
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,854
You're killing me,
do you know that?

482
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,598
You've got no sick time
left according to Command.
I mean, I was told to terminate.

483
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:31,684
It's okay. I'll just get
my things out of my locker.

484
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:35,867
Excuse me. It's not okay.
I-I never fired anybody in my life, man.

485
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,994
I'm sorry, Captain.
Don't take it too hard.

486
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:47,375
<i>Nobody tells me to fire anybody, ever.</i>

487
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:51,336
I told them, "Stick it right up
your big one." Pardon me.

488
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:54,633
<i>I said, "You wanna fire him?</i>
<i>Come on over and do it yourself."</i>

489
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:57,716
You know they won't do it.
It's up to you. You've gotta be strong.

490
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,715
- Be a man.
- I am a man.
You think they give these to sissies?

491
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:05,599
<i>Come on, kid. This is a weekend</i>
<i>of full moons. Nobody wants to work.</i>

492
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:07,722
<i>I mean, your partner</i>
<i>Larry's called in sick.</i>

493
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:10,893
Okay, Larry Veeber.
Stupid Stanley too.

494
00:37:11,026 --> 00:37:14,727
<i>Come on. I need bodies out there.</i>
<i>I got buses that gotta run.</i>

495
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:16,738
I had to put Marcus on 62-Young.

496
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:19,986
Hey. Hey. You know he's not
supposed to work two nights in a row.

497
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,906
- You know what we're in for
with that one?
- You swore you'd fire me...

498
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:25,245
if I came in late again.

499
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:27,912
<i>- I'll fire you tomorrow.</i>

500
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:31,080
Even better than that,
what was I thinking about?

501
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:34,249
I could forward you some sick time.
How about a week?

502
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:37,586
A week's not gonna do it.
A week's not gonna do it.

503
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:42,342
- Kid, you're saying
no, it ain't gonna do it.

504
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,052
You're going out
with Marcus. Okay?

505
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:50,061
Duty calls you, kid.
The city needs you. Please.

506
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:53,060
<i>I'll front you sick time.</i>
<i>I'll make it up to you. Honest to God.</i>

507
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:57,238
Look at me. The next time
I see you, I'll fire you.

508
00:37:57,364 --> 00:38:01,231
- I can bark too.
<i>- Pierce, you can do it all.</i>

509
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:03,574
I never said
I could bark better than you.

510
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:06,739
<i>Go and help... Go and help</i>
<i>the people of New York. Go ahead.</i>

511
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:09,542
<i>Get out there and mop them up for me.</i>
<i>Go ahead. Do your job.</i>

512
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:13,035
<i>- Do your job. You're the best.</i>
<i>- Put down that crack stem.</i>

513
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:16,332
Put down that crack stem
and drop your jug of sin,

514
00:38:16,423 --> 00:38:19,792
your high-heeled skirts
and your stock dividends,

515
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:23,130
your patent leather underwear,
televised suicides,

516
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:26,929
<i>lap dancers in leotards</i>
<i>in delicatessens.</i>

517
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,638
<i>And the Lord said,</i>
<i>"If you can find one that</i>
<i>isn't a sinner... just one...</i>

518
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:35,141
<i>- then I will spare the city. "</i>
- My Lord, Mother of Man.

519
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:39,604
Boy, you look like hell.
What you drinking?

520
00:38:39,737 --> 00:38:43,355
Captain almost fired me tonight.
I'm on my way out.

521
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:45,365
Anytime now.

522
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:48,578
<i>Nobody gets fired, son.</i>
<i>Look at me.</i>

523
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:51,908
The most they might do
is transfer you to the Bronx.

524
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:55,327
Boy, you look like you aged about
ten years since I rode with you last.

525
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:57,868
I ain't feeling so hot.

526
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:03,338
I've been seeing the ghosts.

527
00:39:04,804 --> 00:39:08,173
- You mean the people we lost?
- Yeah.

528
00:39:08,308 --> 00:39:10,799
If they got to go, got to go.
God bless 'em.

529
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:16,439
You ever notice people who see shit
are always crazy? Mm-hmm.

530
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:18,439
<i>Scientific fact.</i>

531
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:21,686
- I think the worst is over.
<i>- Oh, no, son.</i>

532
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,734
It can always get worse.
See, you can't change what's out there.

533
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:27,740
Only where
you're coming from.

534
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:30,406
So you got to let the good Lord...
Thank you, Jesus...

535
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,825
take over in here.

536
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,206
6-2 Young.
Let's go, 6-2 Young. Answer the radio.

537
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:39,205
Marcus, it's Love.
I haven't heard her in months.

538
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:42,872
Well, no,
she only works when I'm on.

539
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:45,712
I makes her wait.
Drives her crazy.

540
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:48,963
- It is true you and Love
went on a blind date?
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,429
- She hit you with a bottle?
- Why you gotta bring that up?

542
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:54,550
She loves me the way
no woman ever has.

543
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,843
6-2 Young, I don't have time
for your games.

544
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,553
<i>Now, answer me or do I have</i>
<i>to come out there myself?</i>

545
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,897
Oh, sookie, sookie.
now. Rough.

546
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:04,980
<i>Now, see, I usually don't do</i>
<i>calls before my coffee,</i>

547
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:08,232
but I think this'll
be good for you, son.

548
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,903
6-2 Young is here, baby.

549
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,407
And I'm gonna take care of you.

550
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:19,870
Come on, white boy.

551
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:24,664
'Cause Big Daddy Marcus
is alive and on arrival, baby.

552
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,584
<i>I'm not your baby, Young.</i>
<i>I'm not your mother either.</i>

553
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:32,094
<i>You're going to a cardiac arrest.</i>
<i>30th and 11th, north-east corner.</i>

554
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,759
<i>It's a club.</i>
<i>Take the back entrance.</i>

555
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,560
All right, 10-4, sweet mama.
You feeling better, Frank?

556
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,559
- I feel worse.
<i>- Oh, that's good, boy.</i>

557
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:43,021
This here is for you.

558
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,618
I hope we're not too late from you folks
holding us up here. Excuse me.

559
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,617
Right this way.

560
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:21,561
Get the hell out of my way.

561
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,560
Okay, what happened?

562
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:27,104
- Please tell me he's gonna be all right.
- No, he dead.

563
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,985
- You buggin'. We just signed
our first record deal.
- Look, he dead, son.

564
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:32,068
Ain't nothing we can do about it.
Come on, Frank. That's it.

565
00:41:32,196 --> 00:41:35,316
<i>- What do you mean he's dead?</i>
- He's not dead.

566
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,987
It's a heroin overdose.
Let's break out the Narcan.

567
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,994
He's dead, unless you folks wanna stop
bullshitting me and tell it straight.

568
00:41:43,123 --> 00:41:46,124
Then, the good Lord willing,
we'll try and bring him back.

569
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,335
<i>He broke up</i>
<i>with his old lady.</i>

570
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:52,168
- We didn't break up.
We were just seeing other people.
- Oh, she broke his heart.

571
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,503
<i>- Shut up, arsehole! Nobody asked you!</i>
- Was I talking to you?

572
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:57,842
Dick, shut up!

573
00:41:57,972 --> 00:41:59,846
I'm still waiting
and this young man here is still dead.

574
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:03,673
<i>- You wanna leave here</i>
<i>in a body bag too?</i>
<i>- You'll end up like him, dick!</i>

575
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:08,021
<i>- Shut up!</i>
- He's been snorting
that Red Death stuff.

576
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:11,351
It's been going on
for, like, four days now.

577
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:16,527
I rebuke the spirit of drugs
in the name of Jesus. What's his name?

578
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:18,697
<i>- I.B. Bangin'.</i>
- What you mean I.B. Bangin'?

579
00:42:18,826 --> 00:42:20,947
- I.B. Bangin'.
- What the hell kind of name
is I.B. Bangin'?

580
00:42:21,076 --> 00:42:23,034
<i>- I don't know his real name.</i>
- It's Frederick Smith.

581
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:25,036
<i>- Okay, Freddy...</i>
- It's Frederick.

582
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:28,498
Okay, I.B. Bangin', we're gonna
bring you back from the dead.

583
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:31,711
<i>Now, I want everybody here to grab</i>
<i>the hand of the person next to you.</i>

584
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:36,840
Come on now.
We ain't got much time.

585
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:39,292
<i>And look up</i>
<i>towards the heavens.</i>

586
00:42:39,428 --> 00:42:43,425
<i>Dear Lord,</i>
<i>here I am again...</i>

587
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:47,804
asking one more chance
for a sinner.

588
00:42:47,936 --> 00:42:52,646
Please, Lord, bring back
I.B. Bangin', Lord.

589
00:42:52,775 --> 00:42:56,524
You have the power, Jesus.
You have the might.

590
00:42:56,653 --> 00:43:00,568
You have the super light
to spare this worthless man.

591
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:04,654
<i>- My God! Frederick!</i>
- Rise up, I.B. Bangin'...

592
00:43:04,786 --> 00:43:07,408
and start your life anew!

593
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:09,413
Oh, thank You, Lord.

594
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:12,577
- What happened?
- You fucking died, you stupid bastard.

595
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,249
- I warned you.
- Damn, you guys are good.
<i>- Not us.</i>

596
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:19,958
The first step is Love.
The second is Mercy.

597
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:29,059
That guy I brought in yesterday,
post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

598
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:32,139
Burke? You're not gonna believe it.
He's showing cognitive signs.

599
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:35,770
It started with spontaneous respiration.
Now he's fighting to pull out the tube.

600
00:43:35,899 --> 00:43:38,936
He had to be sedated. He's in CAT scan.
There's no room in I.C.U.

601
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,944
- What do you think?
<i>- Who knows?</i>

602
00:43:41,072 --> 00:43:44,903
<i>It's all lower brain stem</i>
<i>activity at this point.</i>
<i>The heart refuses to stabilize.</i>

603
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:48,948
You know, he coded 11 times
since he got here.

604
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,952
<i>But the guy's a fighter.</i>

605
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:52,989
<i>Every time the Valium wears off,</i>
<i>he starts yanking on the restraints.</i>

606
00:43:53,124 --> 00:43:54,951
The family know?

607
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:57,291
<i>I wanted to bring them in</i>
<i>to see if he'd respond to voices.</i>

608
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,294
But there was no one
in the waiting room.

609
00:43:59,422 --> 00:44:01,296
This guy's daughter
was in my face all night.

610
00:44:01,424 --> 00:44:03,298
Finally, I got something
positive to tell her, she's gone.

611
00:44:03,427 --> 00:44:07,259
You put poison in your veins,
and now that you're breathing again,

612
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:11,433
you can't wait to say
"Thank you very much"
and get back out to poison shopping.

613
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,228
Well, since we saved your life,
could you do us a favor...

614
00:44:14,353 --> 00:44:16,227
<i>and stop breathing</i>
<i>in another city next time?</i>

615
00:44:16,355 --> 00:44:18,228
I ever tell you
about that time years ago...

616
00:44:18,357 --> 00:44:21,808
I was on this ledge uptown
trying to pull this damn psycho inside?

617
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:25,894
You mean where the guy jumped
and you almost fell?
No, you never told me <i>that</i> story.

618
00:44:26,032 --> 00:44:27,906
<i>No, you never listened.</i>

619
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:33,158
There I was.
I put everything I had into saving
this dumb-ass, low-life suicidal...

620
00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:36,787
that when he went down,
it was like I wanted to go with him.

621
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,791
<i>That happened once in Ireland.</i>

622
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:42,999
This girl jumped off the cliffs
of Moher and the wind blew her back up.

623
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:46,964
- The wind blew her back up?
- Yeah, the wind.

624
00:44:47,095 --> 00:44:49,632
- No, that was Jesus, son.
- It was also the wind.

625
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:52,051
<i>The wind, my black ass.</i>
<i>That was Jesus.</i>

626
00:44:52,181 --> 00:44:54,008
<i>Don't tell me</i>
<i>about the Good Book.</i>

627
00:44:54,142 --> 00:44:56,847
<i>I'll preach heaven and beat the hell</i>
<i>out of you. Don't tell me that now.</i>

628
00:44:56,978 --> 00:44:58,935
I was going, son.

629
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:03,856
But if someone up on high... Thank You,
Jesus... hadn't have pulled me in...

630
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:06,025
<i>Would you turn left here?</i>
<i>I wanna make a stop.</i>

631
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:11,824
<i>The point is, everybody go through a</i>
<i>stretch where folks gonna die on you.</i>

632
00:45:11,951 --> 00:45:14,193
Just don't meditate on it.

633
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:22,169
I'll be right back.

634
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:38,308
Hello. It's Frank Pierce
from the ambulance last night.

635
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,559
I brought your father
into the hospital.

636
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:43,724
<i>- I just learned some news.</i>
<i>- I'll be right down.</i>

637
00:45:49,988 --> 00:45:51,862
He's better, isn't he?

638
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,362
<i>Well, the doctor says</i>
<i>he's showing some movement.</i>

639
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:57,992
I mean, it's still early. It might mean
nothing, but I thought you'd wanna know.

640
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:02,783
Yeah, I knew.
I sensed it when I heard your voice.

641
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:07,331
You-You look so different.

642
00:46:07,462 --> 00:46:09,870
Oh.
It's awful, isn't it?

643
00:46:10,007 --> 00:46:12,545
It's like <i>Night</i>
<i>of the Living Cheerleaders.</i>

644
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:16,046
No, I think it looks good.

645
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,763
Ah, I was going nuts in that waiting
room. I came back to check on my mom.

646
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:23,095
<i>- How is she?</i>
- She's sleeping.

647
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:26,183
Sleeping.

648
00:46:29,902 --> 00:46:34,029
I was just gonna get some food.
Pizza. I thought maybe we...

649
00:46:34,155 --> 00:46:38,153
You can't kill my father that easy.
He's a real fighter, like with me.

650
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:41,119
He hasn't talked to me in three years.
But it's okay.

651
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:43,950
Sometimes you just have
to put things behind you.

652
00:46:44,082 --> 00:46:47,036
I gotta be getting back.
Hey. Hey!

653
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:51,000
It'll be tough to get a taxi here.
We can give you a ride if you like.

654
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,040
Okay.

655
00:46:55,927 --> 00:46:57,801
<i>Who that?</i>

656
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:00,384
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest
I brought in last night.

657
00:47:00,514 --> 00:47:04,299
I told her we'd give her a ride
back to Misery. Her father's
showing signs of improving.

658
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:08,812
Oh, Frank, you got it bad, son.
So much worse than what I thought.

659
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:12,024
- I'm hungry too. We gotta get
something to eat after this.
- God, help us. He's hungry.

660
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:03,357
Dad?

661
00:48:03,492 --> 00:48:06,363
Can you hear me?

662
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:08,405
It's Mary.

663
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:15,370
Squeeze my hand if
you can hear me, Dad.

664
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:18,291
He squeezed my hand.

665
00:48:18,423 --> 00:48:20,748
He's moving, Doctor.
He grabbed my hand.

666
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:23,635
Come on, Dad. Show 'em.
Come on. See? See?

667
00:48:23,761 --> 00:48:26,965
<i>I'll be damned. It's movement.</i>
<i>Just not sure how voluntary it is.</i>

668
00:48:27,098 --> 00:48:29,720
<i>No, he heard me.</i>

669
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:32,687
<i>Come on, Dad. Yeah.</i>

670
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:38,557
Oh! Nurse Crupp.

671
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:42,773
<i>Nurse Crupp!</i>
<i>Ten milligrams of Valium!</i>

672
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:45,990
<i>Get over here.</i>

673
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:48,868
<i>- Where's that Valium?</i>
- Why don't we step out
for a little while,

674
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:50,868
- wait till this passes.
<i>- Make sure he's breathing.</i>

675
00:48:54,374 --> 00:48:56,118
He wants
to pull that tube out.

676
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:59,371
It's pretty painful.
That's why they keep him sedated.

677
00:48:59,505 --> 00:49:01,996
- But it's a good sign.
- Are you sure?

678
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:04,173
I know my father
would hate being tied down.

679
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:06,341
He wouldn't even go
to the dentist.

680
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,222
That's how it's done.

681
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:15,093
You have to keep the body going
until the brain and the heart...

682
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:17,102
recover enough
to go on their own.

683
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:19,769
He's better though, right?

684
00:49:21,193 --> 00:49:23,066
He's better.

685
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:27,945
I'm sorry.
It's just...

686
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:30,481
It's important to me.
I mean, a week ago...

687
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:33,951
I was wishing he was dead.

688
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,116
And now, I wanna hear
his voice just once more.

689
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,289
You know what I mean?

690
00:49:39,419 --> 00:49:41,577
<i>Went over to Ray's and got this.</i>

691
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:44,999
Must be a place reserved in hell
for somebody who charges $1.50 a slice.

692
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:47,007
Anything comes up,
I'll call you.

693
00:49:47,136 --> 00:49:49,804
- Bon appetit.
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Marcus.

694
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:55,178
Oh, thank...
I'm not really hungry.

695
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:03,685
You know, my father's
a really wonderful man.

696
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:06,189
There was nobody
he wouldn't help.

697
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,071
You know that crazy guy, Noel,
who I gave water to last night?

698
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:13,195
<i>He lived at our house</i>
<i>for almost a year.</i>

699
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:16,493
Total stranger
he'd do anything for.

700
00:50:16,621 --> 00:50:18,495
His own family, though...

701
00:50:18,623 --> 00:50:21,790
It's best not to...
dwell.

702
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:23,876
Yeah.

703
00:50:24,004 --> 00:50:26,292
It's good pizza, huh?

704
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,914
Mmm, it's not as good
as, uh, Nino's.

705
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:33,926
<i>You remember that pizza place,</i>
<i>Mimi's, on 10th, maybe 15 years ago?</i>

706
00:50:34,055 --> 00:50:37,886
When you ordered a pie, it came with
a little plastic Madonna in the middle.

707
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:41,053
Saint Anthony, yeah.
You from the neighborhood?

708
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:43,938
- I grew up on 43rd.
I went to Holy Cross.
<i>- Really?</i>

709
00:50:44,064 --> 00:50:46,935
I went to Sacred Heart.
Where'd you go to high school?

710
00:50:47,067 --> 00:50:51,979
Well, you know, Mary,
we moved out after that. Upstate.

711
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:55,531
Yeah. Like everybody else,
except us.

712
00:50:57,245 --> 00:51:00,411
<i>- So, your parents... Good.</i>
- They're fine.

713
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:03,871
My old man's a bus driver,
and Mom a nurse.

714
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:06,621
Sort of born to it,
I guess.

715
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:10,127
- You married?
<i>- Uh, no.</i>

716
00:51:11,383 --> 00:51:14,052
I was.

717
00:51:14,177 --> 00:51:16,051
Hard to explain.

718
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:22,344
She had a hard time
adjusting to, uh...

719
00:51:22,476 --> 00:51:26,344
Well, maybe-maybe
it was my fault too.

720
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,972
<i>White cocksucker!</i>
<i>Don't be touchin' me!</i>

721
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:32,442
Is it always this bad in here?
How does anybody survive?

722
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,485
<i>- Gosh.</i>
- Well, it's been bad lately,
but it's-it's always bad.

723
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:39,285
How long have you been doing this?

724
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,449
Five years.

725
00:51:41,578 --> 00:51:44,413
Wow. You must've
seen some things, huh?

726
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:47,457
Well, no. I mean, you sort of learn
to block it out, you know?

727
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:52,246
It's like, um... like cops
fencing off a crime scene.

728
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:56,426
But then,
something good'll happen.

729
00:51:56,552 --> 00:51:59,386
Everything just glows.

730
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:03,547
You must get
a lot of overdoses.

731
00:52:03,684 --> 00:52:06,055
Bet you picked me up
a couple times.

732
00:52:07,145 --> 00:52:09,054
I think I'd remember that.

733
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:11,644
Maybe not.

734
00:52:11,774 --> 00:52:13,897
I was a different person then.

735
00:52:16,237 --> 00:52:18,478
Does everyone you meet
just...

736
00:52:18,614 --> 00:52:22,363
- spill their guts on you like this?
- Uh, mostly.

737
00:52:22,493 --> 00:52:24,403
Must be my face.

738
00:52:24,537 --> 00:52:26,613
My mother always said
I look like a priest.

739
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:29,665
You do. Yeah.

740
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,793
Yeah, my mom thought
I was gonna be a nun...

741
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,080
because, uh, I ran away
to a convent when I was 13.

742
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:43,294
But I didn't want to be a nun.
I just... I wanted to run away.

743
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:48,591
Well, Sister Mary or Mary the Junkie,
it didn't really matter to me.

744
00:52:50,979 --> 00:52:53,552
- You know, I better go
check on my father.
- Yeah, all right.

745
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,849
Thanks for the pizza.
I owe you one.

746
00:52:56,984 --> 00:53:00,318
Maybe, um,
when he gets better.

747
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:04,147
- When we're through with all of this.
- Sure.

748
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:12,790
Look after her, Griss,
okay?

749
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:19,748
Rule number one: Don't
get involved with patients.

750
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,918
Rule number two: Don't get involved
with patients' daughters.

751
00:53:23,052 --> 00:53:24,926
- You understand?
What about rule number three?

752
00:53:25,054 --> 00:53:26,928
Don't get involved
with dispatchers named Love.

753
00:53:27,056 --> 00:53:29,594
Now, boy, you don't know nothin'
about rule number three.

754
00:53:29,726 --> 00:53:33,509
Cannot begin to understand
the complexities of that rule.

755
00:53:35,772 --> 00:53:37,812
Come on. Let's go look
at some hookers, hmm?

756
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:41,773
Kit Kat Club
be lettin' out 'bout now.

757
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:43,778
<i>74-Will. 330, West 33rd.</i>

758
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:46,575
<i>Church of Jesus Son,</i>

759
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:49,239
<i>72-Victor,</i>
<i>you're goin' to 8th and 14th.</i>

<i>hearin' celebrity voices.</i>

<i>541 West 54th St,</i>

762
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,492

<i>abducted by her cat.</i>

763
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:04,921
<i>Look at these women.</i>
<i>Can't even tell who's a hooker no more.</i>

764
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:07,258
<i>Whatever happened to</i>
<i>go-go boots and hot pants?</i>

765
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:09,260
<i>They'll wear anything now.</i>

766
00:54:09,388 --> 00:54:11,844
Walk out the house
with whatever they got on.

767
00:54:14,936 --> 00:54:17,392
You got the wrong guy!
Hands off, baby!

768
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:19,764
<i>The street's not like the E.R.</i>

769
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,395
<i>There's no walls, no controls.</i>

770
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:27,564
<i>To make up for that, they try</i>
<i>to teach me how to act without thinking,</i>

771
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:33,202
<i>like a soldier who can take apart</i>
<i>and reassemble a gun blindfolded.</i>

772
00:54:33,328 --> 00:54:36,365
Kick his ass!
Fuck him up! Fuck him up!

773
00:54:36,498 --> 00:54:39,369
Kick his ass!
Beat the shit out of him, baby!

774
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:41,375
<i>Beat the shit out of him!</i>

775
00:54:41,504 --> 00:54:43,377
<i>I realized</i>
<i>that my training was useful...</i>

776
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:45,877
<i>in less than ten percent</i>
<i>of the calls,</i>

777
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:49,957
<i>and saving someone's life</i>
<i>was rarer than that.</i>

778
00:54:50,094 --> 00:54:52,586
<i>After a while,</i>
<i>I grew to understand...</i>

779
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:57,883
<i>that my role was less about saving</i>
<i>lives than about bearing witness.</i>

780
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,344
<i>I was a grief mop.</i>

781
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,805
<i>It was enough that</i>
<i>I simply showed up.</i>

782
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:05,893
<i>Except with Rose.</i>

783
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,864
<i>Shut up!</i>

784
00:55:13,993 --> 00:55:17,777
- I'll get ya a glass of water.
Noel, I'm your friend.

785
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,583
Come on, calm down.
I'm gonna take you to a spa.

786
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:23,378
I'm gonna get you a facial. Shh, shh.

787
00:55:23,503 --> 00:55:25,791
<i>Get him in there!</i>

788
00:55:28,632 --> 00:55:31,253
<i>Look-Look-Look at that.</i>
<i>Hmm? Look at that.</i>

789
00:55:31,385 --> 00:55:34,967
Leaves you with no idea what's
underneath. Not even a suggestion.

790
00:55:35,096 --> 00:55:37,718
<i>Could be a skeleton</i>
<i>for all you know.</i>

791
00:55:42,603 --> 00:55:45,439
<i>Yeah, that-that's nice, though.</i>
<i>Right there. Mm-hmm.</i>

792
00:55:45,565 --> 00:55:48,981
<i>Pullin' back her hood</i>
<i>as we drive by.</i>

793
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,517
See, there's a mystery to it.

794
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:53,860
<i>- Then she shows ya.</i>
- She's not a whore, Marcus.

795
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:56,113
<i>We're all whores, Frank.</i>

796
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:58,947
You know what I'm talkin' about?
The way she looked at me.

797
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:02,281
She wasn't lookin' at you, man.
She was lookin' at me.

798
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:05,582
Why did you kill me, Frank?

799
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,117
- I didn't kill you.
- No, you didn't, Frank, and thank you.

800
00:56:08,253 --> 00:56:10,127
But there's still a couple hours
left on our shift.

801
00:56:10,256 --> 00:56:13,422
- No, it's not you. It's some...
- You hearin' them voices again?

802
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:16,172
- I just need a drink.
- What-What them voices sayin' to ya?

803
00:56:16,303 --> 00:56:18,177
They say, "Kill Marcus!"
Okay?

804
00:56:18,305 --> 00:56:21,092
That ain't funny, Frank.

805
00:56:21,224 --> 00:56:23,431
Look, I don't need shock treatments.
I'm not sick, all right?

806
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,434
- I just need a drink.
- Okay.

807
00:56:25,562 --> 00:56:27,934
<i>62-Young,</i>
<i>answer the radio. I have a call for you.</i>

808
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:33,019
<i>I can't wait all night, Young.</i>
<i>I'm holdin' a priority,</i>

809
00:56:33,154 --> 00:56:35,028
<i>and if you don't answer</i>
<i>I'm gonna knock you outta service.</i>

810
00:56:35,156 --> 00:56:38,819
62-Young is here, baby,
and I'm gonna help you out.

811
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,784
Just remember,
you owe me.

812
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,402
<i>You're going to 370 West 98th Street.</i>

813
00:56:44,538 --> 00:56:47,990
<i>17-year-old female, cardiac arrest.</i>
<i>No further information.</i>

814
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:51,826
- 10-4, hon.
- Why is everything a cardiac arrest?

815
00:56:51,963 --> 00:56:56,672
What happened to chest pain,
difficulty breathing, fractured hands?

816
00:56:56,802 --> 00:56:59,291
Come on, people!

817
00:57:00,804 --> 00:57:02,880
Lord Jesus,
help me get through the night.

818
00:57:12,984 --> 00:57:15,734
I hate this block.
Nothin' but crackheads.

819
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,233
- I don't wanna go in there
without the police.
- I'm goin'.

820
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:20,237
It's easier than waitin'.

821
00:57:23,618 --> 00:57:25,492
E.M.S!

822
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,787
- Ambulance!
- Oh, Jesus. My bad back.

823
00:57:28,915 --> 00:57:32,331
<i>My feet hurt.</i>
<i>Damn crackheads.</i>

824
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:36,292
- E.M.S!
- Hello? E.M.S.

825
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:46,388
Hello?

826
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,346
Please, hurry.

827
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,014
Please hurry.
Come this way, please.

828
00:57:58,152 --> 00:58:01,568
- She's over here.
This way. Hurry.

829
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:10,904
<i>My, oh, my, a fat crackhead!</i>
<i>Now, that's a first.</i>

830
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,081
- What's wrong?
- No English. She has
terrible pain in her belly.

831
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:19,627
- I mean, she's pregnant.
- No, no, that's impossible.
We're virgins.

832
00:58:19,757 --> 00:58:22,711
Are you pregnant?
<i>¿Estas embarazada?</i>

833
00:58:22,842 --> 00:58:25,879
Can you walk?
<i>¿Puedes caminar?</i>

834
00:58:26,012 --> 00:58:27,922
- She say she in great pain.
- Thank-Thank you.

835
00:58:28,056 --> 00:58:30,427
Thank you for the translation.
What's your name?

836
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:34,555
<i>¿Nombre?</i>
All right, let's have a look.

837
00:58:37,189 --> 00:58:39,182
You two know each other
a long time?

838
00:58:39,317 --> 00:58:41,393
Yeah, two years,
ever since we left the island.

839
00:58:41,527 --> 00:58:44,101
This is a personal question,
but I gotta ask it.

840
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,359
- In all that time, you never had sex?
- No, never.

841
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:51,405
Maybe you had a couple of beers
one night last summer.
You know how it works, son.

842
00:58:51,536 --> 00:58:54,242
- No cigarettes, no drugs, no beer.
- No underwear?

843
00:58:54,373 --> 00:58:57,575
- We're virgins!
- Oh, Jesus, we'd better go.
Call for backup!

844
00:58:57,709 --> 00:59:00,414
<i>- It's coming. Hold her down.</i>
- My God! What the hell is that?

845
00:59:00,545 --> 00:59:03,547
- It's three legs.
- That's too many!

846
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:05,298
<i>- They're comin'!</i>
- Is she dying?

847
00:59:05,426 --> 00:59:07,300
<i>- She's having a baby. Twins.</i>
- That's <i>imposible.</i>

848
00:59:07,428 --> 00:59:10,796
It's possible! It's possible!
She's having a baby, okay?

849
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:13,256
It's a miracle.

850
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,260
Contractions stopped.
Help me get her out of here.

851
00:59:18,396 --> 00:59:20,436
Ow!
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

852
00:59:20,565 --> 00:59:24,017
My back. Hold it.

853
00:59:24,153 --> 00:59:26,857
- All right, look,
let's just put her down.

854
00:59:26,988 --> 00:59:29,610
Put her over here.
Let's just put her down.

855
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:32,825
You take the first one.

856
00:59:39,249 --> 00:59:43,200
It's a boy, Frank.
He looks good.

857
00:59:43,337 --> 00:59:45,543
How's yours?

858
00:59:48,634 --> 00:59:50,673
Open the door!

859
00:59:50,803 --> 00:59:52,961
She had a pulse!

860
00:59:53,097 --> 00:59:54,924
<i>Code! Code blue!</i>

861
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,884
<i>- We're set up in Two.</i>
- Jesus Christ. Get her on the monitor.

862
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,594
<i>- Where's the pediatric cart?</i>
- It's right here.

863
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:05,185
- Give me the blade.
How many months, Frank?
- Can't tell.

864
01:00:05,316 --> 01:00:07,854
- It was a breech. Twins.
The other seems okay.
- Step back, Frank.

865
01:00:07,985 --> 01:00:10,062
Marcus is taking him
and the mother to Maternity.

866
01:00:10,196 --> 01:00:12,818
<i>I'm a mother!</i>
<i>I got a daughter! I got rights!</i>

867
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:15,405
<i>- Start compression.</i>
- Give her some Valium!

868
01:00:15,535 --> 01:00:18,620
- Ten mil, stat!
- Flatline. Let's start C.P.R.

869
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:21,866
- Starting.
- Status?

870
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:26,122
<i>I think I got a pulse. I think.</i>

871
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:32,882
- Fuck!
- Nothing!

872
01:00:34,638 --> 01:00:36,630
<i>- Give me an I.V. line.</i>
<i>- Call X ray.</i>

873
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:38,840
<i>- I.V. 's in. Give me epinephrine.</i>
<i>- How long has she been down?</i>

874
01:00:38,975 --> 01:00:40,884
<i>- About ten minutes.</i>
<i>- Call respiratory.</i>

875
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:44,682
<i>- Excuse me, sir. Can I please</i>
<i>bother you for a cup of water?</i>
<i>- Can we get an X ray here?</i>

876
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:46,936
Oh, my God.

877
01:00:47,065 --> 01:00:49,307
- For days, I have eaten
nothing but sand, O Lord.
<i>- Stop compression.</i>

878
01:00:49,442 --> 01:00:51,898
- I've waited so long.
<i>- All right, status?</i>

879
01:00:52,029 --> 01:00:54,436
- Can I please get some fucking water?
<i>- Flatline!</i>

880
01:00:54,573 --> 01:00:56,482
Jesus Christ!
Who woke that guy up?

881
01:00:56,617 --> 01:00:58,491
- Come on.
- I've got nothing.

882
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:00,860
<i>Shit.</i>

883
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:04,199
<i>Are the parents here?</i>
<i>Someone's gonna have to tell 'em.</i>

884
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,915
Don't give me that look.

885
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:16,588
- What look?
- You know what look.
It's all over your face.

886
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:19,388
That I-Just-Saved-
A-Little-Baby-Boy look.

887
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:22,763
<i>We</i> just saved a little,
bouncin' baby boy.

888
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:25,015
- Think of it that way.
- I don't wanna hear about it, okay?

889
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:27,386
That's three jobs for the night.
It's over. Three jobs.

890
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:30,392
Time for a drink.
Six A.M.., the cocktail hour.

891
01:01:30,524 --> 01:01:33,098
So, pass the bottle.
I know you're holding.

892
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:36,153
The bar is now open.

893
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,687
I hate gin.

894
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:41,280
You know, when I had that
little baby in my hands,

895
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,736
I felt like I was
21 again.

896
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:47,868
Call like that makes me wanna go back
to workin' three nights a week, not two.

897
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,328
- You know, start runnin' again,
cut down on my drinkin'.
- I'll drink to that.

898
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:55,830
Here's to the greatest job
in the world.

899
01:01:58,092 --> 01:01:59,966
The greatest job in the world.

900
01:02:00,094 --> 01:02:02,799
<i>62-Young, I have</i>
<i>priorities holdin'. Pick up the radio.</i>

901
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,805
Don't do it, Marcus.
Please.

902
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,842
Tell her the bus died.
Tell her the radio's not working.

903
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,851
Tell her
our backs are out.

904
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:12,099
Tell her... Tell her we're too drunk
to take any more calls.

905
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:14,189
Okay?

906
01:02:15,985 --> 01:02:18,061
- Let's take it!
- No!

907
01:02:18,195 --> 01:02:22,193
62-Young, this is Marcus.
Only for you, baby! Only for you!

908
01:02:22,324 --> 01:02:24,198
<i>- Keep it to yourself, Young.</i>

909
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:26,996
<i>Male diff breather, approximately 30.</i>
<i>West End and 72nd.</i>

910
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:29,493
10-4, hon.
I'm comin', baby!

911
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:31,700
Big Daddy Marcus is comin'!

912
01:02:31,834 --> 01:02:34,040
- We comin'! We comin'!
- No!

913
01:02:34,169 --> 01:02:35,829
<i>Lord have mercy!</i>

914
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:48,055
<i>Thank You, Jesus.</i>

915
01:02:48,184 --> 01:02:51,268
- Are you all right?
- Amen. Thank You, Jesus.

916
01:02:51,395 --> 01:02:54,597
Oh, thank You, Lord.

917
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,770
Oh, thank You, Jesus.

918
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:02,862
That is the last time
you do this to me, Marcus.

919
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:08,942
- Where are you goin', Frank?
- I quit!

920
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:10,951
I'm through.

921
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,330
Oh, you think just 'cause you quit,
them ghosts gonna quit too?

922
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:17,032
It don't work
that way, Frank!

923
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:19,376
I've been there, son!

924
01:03:19,506 --> 01:03:22,126
You need the Holy Ghost, Frank!

925
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:24,167
The Holy Ghost!

926
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:35,267
Noel.

927
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,990
- What's going on, Griss?
- Your friend there just
untied the water beggar.

928
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:54,068
Griss was comin' out to thank her.
Probably saved Griss a murder charge.

929
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,613
She's having a tough time, though.

930
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,025
Excuse me. You seemed
like you were in trouble.

931
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,150
<i>No, I'm all right.</i>
<i>I just...</i>

932
01:04:33,285 --> 01:04:36,036
I can't stand seeing
people tied up.

933
01:04:36,162 --> 01:04:40,540
I'm in that waitin' room for hours,
and I'm listenin' to Noel screamin'.

934
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:43,337
And the only reason that's
he's screamin' is 'cause he's tied up!

935
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:48,789
- Don't seem so bad to me.
<i>- Don't say that.</i>

936
01:04:48,925 --> 01:04:51,132
<i>I almost cut</i>
<i>my father loose too.</i>

937
01:04:51,261 --> 01:04:54,095
You know, one minute they
tell me that he's almost dead.

938
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:57,223
The next minute, they tell me
he's better and I can go in and...

939
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:01,300
It's killing me
seeing him fight like that.

940
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:12,405
Well, since you're here,
maybe, uh,

941
01:05:12,531 --> 01:05:16,065
maybe you could
do me a favor and, uh...

942
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:19,784
wait for me outside
this building, 'cause I gotta
go visit a friend who's sick.

943
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,659
Okay.

944
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:30,668
I'm only asking you because
this is a dangerous building,

945
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,172
and there's been some robberies and
a woman was raped not long ago, and...

946
01:05:33,302 --> 01:05:36,220
<i>This woman I'm seeing, she's gonna</i>
<i>wanna sit and talk with me all day,</i>

947
01:05:36,347 --> 01:05:38,220
but if I can point to you out the window
and tell her that you're waitin',

948
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:40,221
then she'll
let me out quick.

949
01:05:40,349 --> 01:05:42,223
If anything happens,
I'm in 16-M.

950
01:05:42,351 --> 01:05:44,225
Maybe I should
come up with you.

951
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:46,844
<i>If I'm not back in 15 minutes</i>
<i>just hit the buzzer,</i>
<i>and that way she'll let me go.</i>

952
01:05:46,981 --> 01:05:48,855
If that's what's gonna happen.
I'll come with you.

953
01:05:48,983 --> 01:05:50,857
I'm okay. I'm just
visiting a friend who's sick.

954
01:05:53,071 --> 01:05:55,609
I shouldn't have asked you to come.

955
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,698
You asked me not to come.

956
01:05:57,826 --> 01:06:00,113
Promise you won't
go inside.

957
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:02,616
Fifteen minutes.

958
01:06:02,746 --> 01:06:05,118
You know, everyone
at that hospital's crazy!

959
01:06:05,249 --> 01:06:08,583
I'm going crazy too.
You understand?

960
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:11,202
I just have to...

961
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:16,333
I just have to relax a little
and not feel so guilty all the time.

962
01:06:16,468 --> 01:06:18,959
We can still go back.

963
01:06:19,095 --> 01:06:21,716
I'll walk you home.
You sleep for a couple hours.

964
01:06:21,847 --> 01:06:23,721
Watch some TV.
Take a bath.

965
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:25,723
Don't be such a cop.

966
01:06:28,229 --> 01:06:31,645
If you have any doubts
about this, it's my fault.

967
01:06:31,775 --> 01:06:34,348
You go on home.
Really.

968
01:06:34,486 --> 01:06:36,857
I'm fine.
Thanks.

969
01:06:38,323 --> 01:06:40,446
I don't need you.

970
01:06:40,575 --> 01:06:44,240
- Hi.
- Hey, Cy, guess who's here.

971
01:07:06,434 --> 01:07:08,307
Can I help you?

972
01:07:08,435 --> 01:07:11,057
Mary Burke.
She's a friend.

973
01:07:11,188 --> 01:07:13,062
She's not here.

974
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:15,063
Wait a minute. You can't go in.

975
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:17,065
<i>- Kanita?</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

976
01:07:17,194 --> 01:07:19,068
<i>- Hey, Cy!</i>
- Be cool. Be cool.

977
01:07:19,196 --> 01:07:22,316
- It's all good.
<i>- He looks like a cop.</i>

978
01:07:22,449 --> 01:07:26,743
No, he ain't no cop. You're a medic,
right? I'm Cy. Cy Coates.

979
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:28,779
Frank Pierce.

980
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:31,071
Mary said you might
be coming over.

981
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:35,500
- Where is she?
- Sleepin', brother, in the back.

982
01:07:35,627 --> 01:07:37,501
She asked me
to pick her up,

983
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,872
go out for a movie and a malt
and bring her right home.

984
01:07:40,007 --> 01:07:42,214
I know, I know.
I know.

985
01:07:42,343 --> 01:07:46,555
But she told me to tell you she
wants to crash here a few hours.

986
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:50,347
See, it's terrible
about her father and everything.

987
01:07:50,477 --> 01:07:54,141
I better just go in and see her.

988
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:57,556
Frank, see,
I call this the Oasis.

989
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,395
It's a refuge from
the world out there.

990
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:03,100
You wanna come in here,
relax, sit down.

991
01:08:03,238 --> 01:08:05,480
It's all right.
Brother, she is sound asleep.

992
01:08:05,616 --> 01:08:07,490
She ain't gonna know
any difference.

993
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:12,953
No, I'm gonna go see her.

994
01:08:13,081 --> 01:08:17,624
Well, did you know two people got shot
in this buildin' last week?

995
01:08:17,752 --> 01:08:20,919
A priest got robbed
by ten-year-olds across the street.

996
01:08:21,047 --> 01:08:24,298
<i>Oh, brother, be careful.</i>
<i>That's the Tiger.</i>

997
01:08:24,426 --> 01:08:27,297
Lady's down the hall.

998
01:08:27,429 --> 01:08:29,338
Clean up that nose,
brother.

999
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:34,925
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>Dayrise Enterprises, Frank.</i>

1000
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:37,218
<i>Stress-free factory.</i>

1001
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:48,567
Mary. Mary.

1002
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:51,653
We have to get going.

1003
01:08:51,785 --> 01:08:53,659
She asked for something
to help her sleep, brother.

1004
01:08:53,788 --> 01:08:56,113
Mary, we really have to go.

1005
01:08:56,249 --> 01:09:00,198
- Whoa, Frank, she suffered
enough, all right?

1006
01:09:00,335 --> 01:09:03,835
Now, she's gonna be fine.
I promise.

1007
01:09:03,964 --> 01:09:06,632
Come on, Frank.

1008
01:09:12,388 --> 01:09:15,722
Now, I'm always
interested in people
with stressful occupations.

1009
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:20,727
Now, bein' a paramedic, that's about
as stressful as I can imagine.

1010
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,476
<i>Go ahead, take a seat.</i>
<i>Sit down.</i>

1011
01:09:23,608 --> 01:09:26,774
<i>Tell me some war stories.</i>
<i>You know, what's it like?</i>

1012
01:09:28,446 --> 01:09:30,319
Got a beer?

1013
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:32,773
Oh, that shit
is poison, Frank.

1014
01:09:32,909 --> 01:09:34,783
We don't have
alcohol around here.

1015
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:38,612
What you need
is one of these.

1016
01:09:47,755 --> 01:09:50,425
Did-Did you give Mary
something called Red Death?

1017
01:09:52,469 --> 01:09:56,134
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1018
01:09:58,142 --> 01:10:00,016
Red Death.

1019
01:10:03,355 --> 01:10:05,264
Tell me something, Frank.

1020
01:10:08,151 --> 01:10:11,900
Does killing your clients sound like
good business sense to you? Hmm?

1021
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:16,109
<i>See, the kids sellin' that Red Death</i>
<i>are just tryin' to make a quick buck.</i>

1022
01:10:16,242 --> 01:10:19,362
<i>They don't got no respect for me</i>
<i>or the work I done in this community.</i>

1023
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:22,946
But don't worry.
They're gonna be taken care of.

1024
01:10:23,082 --> 01:10:25,787
<i>I got Tiger workin' on it.</i>

1025
01:10:25,918 --> 01:10:28,623
- I should be going. I just quit.
<i>- Oh, look.</i>

1026
01:10:28,755 --> 01:10:31,423
Sleep is all
stress reduction.

1027
01:10:31,548 --> 01:10:34,550
All right?
Here.

1028
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:38,721
Now, if you take one of these,
sleep for two hours...

1029
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,469
That's all you need.

1030
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:49,062
Why do you think
I'm tellin' you this, Frank?

1031
01:10:49,191 --> 01:10:51,184
<i>For my health?</i>

1032
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:54,567
Now, brother, you gotta look at yourself
in the mirror, all right?

1033
01:10:54,696 --> 01:10:56,902
Kanita.

1034
01:10:57,032 --> 01:11:00,281
<i>Would you get our new friend</i>
<i>here a glass of water, please?</i>

1035
01:11:01,369 --> 01:11:03,694
<i>Oh, you're so fine.</i>

1036
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:15,082
Is this what you gave Mary?

1037
01:11:15,216 --> 01:11:18,216
Yep, that's the stuff.
I call it the Red Lion.

1038
01:11:18,344 --> 01:11:20,834
It's very king-of-the-jungle,
"Makuna matata," all that.

1039
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:23,378
<i>There's no language.</i>
<i>Just brute power.</i>

1040
01:11:23,515 --> 01:11:25,757
But, see,

1041
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:30,888
you just ain't gonna believe
how relaxin' that shit
really is, all right?

1042
01:11:55,588 --> 01:11:57,877
- I guess I'll be going.
<i>- Just relax.</i>

1043
01:11:58,007 --> 01:12:00,794
You at the Oasis now.

1044
01:12:00,926 --> 01:12:02,835
All right?

1045
01:12:06,265 --> 01:12:08,341
Take my pulse.

1046
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:19,019
It's good, isn't it?

1047
01:12:19,153 --> 01:12:21,063
It's perfect.

1048
01:12:21,197 --> 01:12:24,316
It's two beats per minute.

1049
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,988
I knew it.

1050
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:29,028
I was wrong about you.

1051
01:12:31,456 --> 01:12:33,413
You're not so bad.

1052
01:15:06,356 --> 01:15:10,057
- You're in the stomach.
- You sure?

1053
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:19,406
You're in the stomach again.

1054
01:15:19,536 --> 01:15:22,074
<i>- You're in the stomach again.</i>
<i>Let me try.</i>
- One more time.

1055
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,409
- Rose.
- Huh?

1056
01:15:27,543 --> 01:15:30,295
My name, Rose.

1057
01:15:35,302 --> 01:15:38,670
- Stomach again.
- No way!

1058
01:15:38,805 --> 01:15:41,177
No pulse.
Let me try.

1059
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:47,020
<i>No pulse!</i>
<i>No pulse, goddam it!</i>

1060
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:54,063
<i>Frank! Frank! Take it easy!</i>
<i>Okay, what happened?</i>

1061
01:15:54,195 --> 01:15:57,812
<i>- He flipped out!</i>
- All right, now, Frank...
Frank, be cool, my brother.

1062
01:15:57,948 --> 01:16:00,700
- You're havin' what you call
a paradoxical reaction.

1063
01:16:00,826 --> 01:16:03,661
<i>- He's psycho!</i>
- Listen to me, Frank.

1064
01:16:03,787 --> 01:16:06,539
<i>Frank, where are you goin'?</i>
<i>You're makin' a mistake.</i>

1065
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:10,365
<i>Yeah, you go. Okay, that's good.</i>
<i>You go in there.</i>

1066
01:16:10,502 --> 01:16:14,547
<i>You go in there, lie down.</i>
<i>Get some sleep, whatever.</i>

1067
01:16:19,177 --> 01:16:21,799
<i>Hey. Look.</i>

1068
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:24,219
- Cy, you want me to stop this?
<i>- No, Tiger, it's all right.</i>

1069
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,222
<i>- You sure?</i>
<i>- It's cool. Be cool. Let him go.</i>

1070
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:28,474
Let him go.

1071
01:16:28,603 --> 01:16:30,975
Put me down!

1072
01:16:33,815 --> 01:16:36,223
<i>Frank, you are makin'</i>
<i>a serious mistake, my man.</i>

1073
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,109
<i>She's just gonna come back.</i>
<i>Oh, and Frank, you owe me ten dollars.</i>

1074
01:16:44,577 --> 01:16:47,329
Put me down.

1075
01:16:53,585 --> 01:16:55,494
Get off!

1076
01:16:57,548 --> 01:17:00,548
<i>- Did you and Cy have a nice talk?</i>
- Let go!

1077
01:17:00,675 --> 01:17:04,258
Did he tell you about
Dayrise Enterprises helping people?

1078
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:08,344
Well, I've seen him
hurt people.

1079
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:14,517
Why are you following me?

1080
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,938
Because you
can barely walk.

1081
01:17:22,614 --> 01:17:27,822
You remember Noel from the other night?
How Noel is now?

1082
01:17:27,953 --> 01:17:30,028
He wasn't always like that.

1083
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:34,699
He was my brother's
best friend.

1084
01:17:34,834 --> 01:17:38,451
Cy or Tiger or one of those goons
put a bullet in Noel's head.

1085
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,461
He was in a coma
for three months.

1086
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:44,207
He's been crazy
ever since.

1087
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:47,176
This is...

1088
01:17:47,305 --> 01:17:49,546
my building.

1089
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:01,099
What is it with you?
You wanna help me?

1090
01:18:01,234 --> 01:18:04,770
You feel sorry for me?
Well, keep it to yourself.

1091
01:18:04,905 --> 01:18:07,573
I just need to sit down
for a minute.

1092
01:18:07,698 --> 01:18:10,948
You wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.

1093
01:18:15,748 --> 01:18:18,370
Hi! Hi.

1094
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:22,702
I've been clean for two years.
No drugs. I got a job.

1095
01:18:22,838 --> 01:18:25,508
I paint when I'm at home.
I don't bother anybody.

1096
01:18:25,632 --> 01:18:29,251
Then all this shit happens.
Oh, no, you don't.

1097
01:18:31,472 --> 01:18:33,512
Hey, you can't stay here.
Come on.

1098
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:35,848
Get up.

1099
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:55,242
Hello. I'm Frank.

1100
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:57,363
Mary's friend.

1101
01:18:57,498 --> 01:19:00,783
A very close friend
who loves animals.

1102
01:19:08,925 --> 01:19:10,799
Hello?

1103
01:19:20,853 --> 01:19:24,553
<i>I washed my face</i>
<i>with three kinds of soap,</i>

1104
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:27,477
<i>each smelling</i>
<i>like a different season.</i>

1105
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:30,859
<i>It felt good to be</i>
<i>in a woman's room again,</i>

1106
01:19:30,988 --> 01:19:36,030
<i>especially a woman who wasn't comatose</i>
<i>or severely disabled.</i>

1107
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,245
<i>I felt like perhaps</i>
<i>I had turned a corner...</i>

1108
01:19:39,372 --> 01:19:41,660
<i>like I saved someone...</i>

1109
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:43,830
<i>though I didn't know who.</i>

1110
01:19:46,629 --> 01:19:48,751
Hey, Pierce.

1111
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,336
You're late, I know it,
but I can't fire you today.

1112
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:55,131
- I got nobody to ride
66-X ray with Wolls.
- No.

1113
01:19:55,261 --> 01:19:58,179
I got a form for you to make out about
the accident when you get some time.

1114
01:19:58,306 --> 01:20:01,057
Come here, kid.
Come here.

1115
01:20:01,183 --> 01:20:03,639
Look, I'm gonna fire you tomorrow.
I promise you.

1116
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:06,261
What-What if there is
no tomorrow?

1117
01:20:06,397 --> 01:20:08,604
Will you get out of here
before I give you a big hug!

1118
01:20:08,733 --> 01:20:12,185
"No tomorrow."
I love that kid.

1119
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:20,236
Frank. Hey, man.
What do you know?

1120
01:20:20,369 --> 01:20:22,859
You and me again, tonight.
The Rough Riders,

1121
01:20:22,996 --> 01:20:26,496
tearin' up the streets
just like old times, huh?

1122
01:20:27,918 --> 01:20:29,994
This old bus is a warrior, Frank.

1123
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:32,003
Just like us.

1124
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:35,132
I have tried to kill him...
many times,

1125
01:20:35,259 --> 01:20:37,465
and he will not die.

1126
01:20:37,594 --> 01:20:40,215
I have great respect for that.

1127
01:20:40,346 --> 01:20:43,763
Okay.

1128
01:20:50,065 --> 01:20:52,735
Get up, right now!
Get up! Cool it!

1129
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,978
I already told you you can't go
in there! Didn't you hear me?

1130
01:20:56,112 --> 01:20:58,151
Don't make me take off
my sunglasses!

1131
01:20:58,281 --> 01:21:01,150
- Good morning, Griss.
- We're full up here tonight, Frank.

1132
01:21:01,283 --> 01:21:03,905
Get the hell out of here.
Step back! Step back!

1133
01:21:27,226 --> 01:21:30,392
<i>Go to the bank,</i>
<i>boy. Take out everything you can.</i>

1134
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:34,813
Mr. Burke?

1135
01:21:34,941 --> 01:21:36,732
<i>I'm going.</i>
<i>I've had enough.</i>

1136
01:21:44,743 --> 01:21:47,613
- You do it.
- I can't reach. You're taller.

1137
01:21:47,746 --> 01:21:50,581
<i>- Don't do it!</i>
- He's getting better.

1138
01:21:50,707 --> 01:21:52,580
- Better than what? It doesn't matter!
- Better than what?

1139
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:54,867
- Why not?
- The family wants us to keep him alive.

1140
01:21:55,002 --> 01:21:56,876
The wife wants to believe in miracles.
We keep him alive.

1141
01:21:57,005 --> 01:21:59,211
Shock him, Frank. He'll come back.
He always comes back.

1142
01:22:04,804 --> 01:22:06,678
Clear!

1143
01:22:06,806 --> 01:22:08,762
<i>- You son of a bitch!</i>
- Nothing. Shock him again.

1144
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:10,764
<i>Don't do it!</i>

1145
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:17,436
<i>- Son of a bitch!</i>
<i>- Do it again.</i>

1146
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:20,520
<i>Don't do it!</i>

1147
01:22:20,653 --> 01:22:22,776
Frank!

1148
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:26,072
<i>Jesus! Move! Move!</i>

1149
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,074
Clear!

1150
01:22:28,203 --> 01:22:30,870
<i>Hey, boy. Where you goin', Frank?</i>

1151
01:22:30,995 --> 01:22:32,655
<i>Hey, Frank!</i>

1152
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,246
Frank? Frank, what the hell
you doin' back there?

1153
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:43,753
I'm sick, Tom.
I need a cure.

1154
01:22:43,883 --> 01:22:47,750
Vitamin B cocktail, followed
by an amp of glucose...

1155
01:22:47,887 --> 01:22:50,888
and a drop of adrenaline.

1156
01:22:51,015 --> 01:22:53,684
It's not as good as beer,
but it's all I got.

1157
01:22:53,809 --> 01:22:57,392
Come on, Frank. There's blood spillin'
in the streets. Let's go have some fun.

1158
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:03,024
Watch out.

1159
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:07,191
You all right?

1160
01:23:07,323 --> 01:23:09,695
These are hard times, Tom.

1161
01:23:09,826 --> 01:23:11,782
Yeah, it's great,
isn't it?

1162
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:14,448
It's great to be drunk.
Sobriety's killing me.

1163
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:16,951
Look up in the sky, Frank.
It's a full moon.

1164
01:23:17,081 --> 01:23:19,489
Blood's gonna run tonight.
I can <i>feel</i> it.

1165
01:23:19,626 --> 01:23:22,331
Our mission:
to save lives.

1166
01:23:22,462 --> 01:23:24,953
Our mission is coffee, Tom.

1167
01:23:25,089 --> 01:23:28,174
A shot of the bull.
Puerto Rican espresso.

1168
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:31,467
10-4.
El Toro de Oro.

1169
01:23:31,596 --> 01:23:33,506
Blast off!

1170
01:23:42,023 --> 01:23:44,939
This cure's not working, Tom.
Maybe we should go back to the hospital.

1171
01:23:45,066 --> 01:23:47,309
Oh, come on. Don't worry.
Tom will take care of ya.

1172
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:49,982
Put your head out the window.
Get some of that nice clean air.

1173
01:23:50,114 --> 01:23:52,866
- Come on, stop it!
<i>- Okay, units, it's suicide hour.</i>

1174
01:23:52,992 --> 01:23:56,361
<i>14th and 7th. A man with a noose around</i>
<i>his neck and nothin' to hang it on.</i>

1175
01:23:56,496 --> 01:23:59,367
<i>66-X ray, don't even think about getting</i>
<i>coffee. I have a call for you too.</i>

1176
01:23:59,499 --> 01:24:03,032
66-Exterminator here.
We like our coffee bloody.

1177
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:06,039
This better be good.
My partner's dying to help someone.

1178
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:10,039
<i>You're in luck, X.</i>
<i>Your patient awaits you</i>
<i>with bleeding wrists in the tunnel.</i>

1179
01:24:10,175 --> 01:24:12,548
- 10-4.
- Tom, where are the Band-Aids?

1180
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:16,261
- This is an ambulance, isn't it?
- Be cool, man.

1181
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:18,548
Look out!

1182
01:24:41,998 --> 01:24:44,406
He does this every time
he gets drunk.

1183
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:46,742
- You smell that?
<i>- But he hates when I call you guys.</i>

1184
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:48,875
What the hell's
goin' on here?

1185
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:50,879
You gotta take him
to the hospital.

1186
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:53,877
- He tried to kill himself.
- You guys got any coffee?

1187
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:56,631
- Show him your wrist.
Go ahead, show him.
- All right, come on.

1188
01:24:56,762 --> 01:24:59,846
<i>Let me see.</i>
<i>It's not even bleeding.</i>

1189
01:24:59,973 --> 01:25:02,547
<i>He does this all the time.</i>
<i>He ain't right.</i>

1190
01:25:02,684 --> 01:25:05,057
It was bleedin' before. He kept spilling
his beer. I gave him mouth-to-mouth.

1191
01:25:05,187 --> 01:25:07,263
You're lucky
you didn't kill him.

1192
01:25:07,398 --> 01:25:11,062
I wanna hear it straight
from the Looney Tunes himself.

1193
01:25:11,193 --> 01:25:13,232
Try to bump yourself off?

1194
01:25:13,362 --> 01:25:15,438
Yes.

1195
01:25:15,572 --> 01:25:17,860
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so?

1196
01:25:17,991 --> 01:25:21,027
Come on.
I'm gonna fix you up.

1197
01:25:21,161 --> 01:25:23,403
<i>Come on, Frank.</i>

1198
01:25:23,538 --> 01:25:26,658
Sir, I am going to give you
some medicine that is still
very experimental.

1199
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:30,872
It's from NASA. And although our
astronauts have been using it for years,

1200
01:25:31,003 --> 01:25:33,126
we are the very
first service to try it.

1201
01:25:33,255 --> 01:25:37,039
Now, I am gonna put this patch
on your forehead, like this.

1202
01:25:37,175 --> 01:25:40,342
And in about a minute,
you will have to relax.

1203
01:25:40,471 --> 01:25:43,140
You will lose all
your suicidal feelings.

1204
01:25:43,265 --> 01:25:47,216
It's very important that you wear
the patch for at least 24 hours.

1205
01:25:47,353 --> 01:25:49,476
And keep checking the mirror.

1206
01:25:49,606 --> 01:25:54,183
<i>If the patch turns green,</i>
<i>you have to see a doctor immediately.</i>

1207
01:25:54,317 --> 01:25:57,188
The side effects could be fatal.
Okay?

1208
01:25:57,321 --> 01:26:00,107
- Okay, now, what did I say?
What color?
- Uh, clean.

1209
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,279
- Clean.
- "Cream." You said "cream."

1210
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:04,318
- Cream. Green.
- Green.

1211
01:26:04,452 --> 01:26:06,410
This, uh...
Excuse me.

1212
01:26:08,457 --> 01:26:12,455
This is the worst suicide attempt
I've ever seen.

1213
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:16,285
Can you feel that pulse?
Here? That's where you cut.

1214
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:19,957
And it's not across.
It's down, like so.

1215
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:21,966
Here.
Take it.

1216
01:26:22,095 --> 01:26:25,262
- I can't. I can't.
- What?

1217
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:27,466
Oh, I see.

1218
01:26:27,601 --> 01:26:30,092
With all the poor people
of this city...

1219
01:26:30,229 --> 01:26:32,635
who wanted only to live
and were viciously murdered,

1220
01:26:32,772 --> 01:26:35,523
you have the nerve
to sit here...

1221
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,607
wanting to die
and not go through with it?

1222
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:39,608
You make me sick!

1223
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:42,737
Take it! Take it!

1224
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:51,154
<i>We cured him!</i>

1225
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:55,584
There's nothin' we can't do
if we just work together.

1226
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:59,377
I told you to stop
for coffee.

1227
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,628
Thanks a lot.

1228
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:09,798
It sounds like they're trying to
clean up the bus terminal tonight.

1229
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:19,891
Hello?
Major Tom to Frank.

1230
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:22,102
Time to just say "no."

1231
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,912
- Where you goin'?
- Come on, Tom, the city's burning.

1232
01:28:07,072 --> 01:28:09,740
What are you doin'?

1233
01:28:09,866 --> 01:28:12,108
I'm driving
out of myself.

1234
01:28:12,243 --> 01:28:16,026
- Uh, these brakes are shot.
- I've taken that into consideration.

1235
01:28:16,163 --> 01:28:18,833
- Frank? Frank?
- Yeah?

1236
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:21,200
Are you okay?

1237
01:28:21,335 --> 01:28:23,826
Never felt better in my life.
How are you?

1238
01:28:23,962 --> 01:28:25,920
- I'm good.
- Good.

1239
01:28:26,048 --> 01:28:28,586
<i>66-X ray. X ray-66.</i>

1240
01:28:28,718 --> 01:28:32,086
- X.
<i>- First of all, I want you to know</i>
<i>how sorry I am about this.</i>

1241
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:36,515
<i>I've always liked you two. A unit above</i>
<i>none. A legend in its own lunchtime.</i>

1242
01:28:36,642 --> 01:28:39,727
<i>So it hurts me deeply to do this,</i>
<i>but I have no choice.</i>

1243
01:28:39,854 --> 01:28:41,929
<i>You must go to</i>
<i>48th and Broadway.</i>

1244
01:28:42,063 --> 01:28:46,477
<i>In front of a liquor store you'll find</i>
<i>a 50-year-old male, unconscious.</i>

1245
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:48,935
<i>It says here,</i>
<i>"Man smells real bad."</i>

1246
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:52,522
<i>- Do I have to say more?</i>
- But you've said too much already.

1247
01:28:52,657 --> 01:28:55,112
- Mr. Oh!
- It's early for him.

1248
01:28:55,243 --> 01:28:57,117
<i>It's all right. We're not meant</i>
<i>to do Oh tonight.</i>

1249
01:28:57,245 --> 01:29:00,660
Something's gonna happen.
I can feel it!

1250
01:29:00,789 --> 01:29:02,663
<i>Sergeant,</i>
<i>put me on the back of that jumper.</i>

1251
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:04,665
E.M.S. to Central.
What was that call?

1252
01:29:04,794 --> 01:29:07,712
- E.M.S., a jumper.
A shooting. West Side Projects.
- 10-4.

1253
01:29:07,839 --> 01:29:10,247
One minute out.
Let's go.

1254
01:29:10,383 --> 01:29:13,053
Somebody's gonna kill themselves.
Let's go. I don't wanna miss it.

1255
01:29:13,178 --> 01:29:15,930
<i>66.</i>
<i>66-X ray, level one emergency.</i>

1256
01:29:16,056 --> 01:29:17,929
<i>Level one emergency.</i>
<i>I need units. I need units.</i>

1257
01:29:18,057 --> 01:29:20,014
<i>We got fires in the hole.</i>
<i>8th and Broadway.</i>

1258
01:29:20,142 --> 01:29:22,928
<i>Shots being fired outside</i>
<i>the Dynamite Club. 13th and 6th.</i>

1259
01:29:23,061 --> 01:29:26,145
<i>Fired workers are shooting each other</i>
<i>at the post office. Where are my units?</i>

1260
01:29:26,273 --> 01:29:28,680
<i>Where are my units?</i>
<i>6- 6? 6-6 X-ray?</i>

1261
01:29:28,817 --> 01:29:32,483
<i>Level one emergency! Level one</i>
<i>emergency! Where are my units?</i>

1262
01:29:32,613 --> 01:29:36,065
<i>The dead are rising, but you can't tell</i>
<i>their faces from the smoke!</i>

1263
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,773
<i>Somebody holdin' him</i>
<i>or somethin'? Is he trying to jump?</i>

1264
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:40,783
<i>Go on home, sinners!</i>

1265
01:29:40,912 --> 01:29:43,035
<i>Go back to your opium pipes</i>
<i>and whisky bottles!</i>

1266
01:29:43,164 --> 01:29:45,834
- What's with the rabbis?
- They love to hang around with us.

1267
01:29:45,959 --> 01:29:49,079
<i>They offered us money for a new rig,</i>
<i>so I deputized them.</i>

1268
01:29:49,212 --> 01:29:51,918
<i>Back to your slot machines,</i>

1269
01:29:52,049 --> 01:29:54,125
ribbed condoms, Mexican divorces,

1270
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,168
your sex clubs and martinis.

1271
01:29:56,303 --> 01:30:00,169
Back to your hot oil wrestling,
Washington lobbying, organ donation.

1272
01:30:00,306 --> 01:30:03,924
- What do we bring?
- Better bring it all.

1273
01:30:04,059 --> 01:30:05,933
You guys grab all the gear.
Let's go.

1274
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:09,762
- This guy a jumper?
- Got a call for shots fired
on the 16th floor.

1275
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:12,390
- The jumper called right after.
- He landed on 14.

1276
01:30:15,821 --> 01:30:17,695
I'm goin' to 16.

1277
01:30:39,844 --> 01:30:43,095
He must've left the tub on.

1278
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:19,712
That's it.
Nobody else home.

1279
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:45,197
Aye, that's gotta hurt.

1280
01:31:45,325 --> 01:31:48,243
<i>- Tell him not to move.</i>
- I'm going down to 14.

1281
01:31:59,463 --> 01:32:01,919
Forget that thing.
Go with the torch. Go.

1282
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:04,422
Hey, get this, Frank.
We got two patients.

1283
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:06,426
Number one:
the scarecrow outside.

1284
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:08,427
Number two:
the big fellah.

1285
01:32:08,556 --> 01:32:11,093
Misses the railing but breaks
both legs on the balcony.

1286
01:32:11,224 --> 01:32:13,894
<i>Then he throws himself</i>
<i>through the glass window.</i>

1287
01:32:14,019 --> 01:32:18,230
Then he starts crawling
that way and, uh, he passed out.

1288
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:24,685
- Well, he's our shish kebab
for the night then.
- Gonna have to torch him.

1289
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:27,738
- How's he doing?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna work on Sleeping Beauty.

1290
01:32:29,492 --> 01:32:31,366
Hey, big guy!

1291
01:32:31,494 --> 01:32:34,496
Either you jump or you get shot.
What are ya gonna do?

1292
01:32:34,623 --> 01:32:36,497
<i>I think I'd rather get shot.</i>

1293
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,534
<i>Drug dealers.</i>

1294
01:32:42,797 --> 01:32:47,422
- Does that hurt?
- No! No. No.

1295
01:32:49,261 --> 01:32:51,966
I don't think you're cut
through any major arteries.

1296
01:32:52,097 --> 01:32:55,301
We have to get you off this thing
without setting off bleeding.

1297
01:32:55,434 --> 01:32:57,427
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1298
01:32:57,562 --> 01:33:01,346
I'll take your blood pressure.

1299
01:33:01,483 --> 01:33:04,731
- All right, I'm in. You in?
- I am now.

1300
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:11,615
If he happens to fall, I don't think
anybody'd be cryin' too much.

1301
01:33:13,744 --> 01:33:16,662
They're gonna torch the fence. You're
gonna feel the metal getting warm.

1302
01:33:16,789 --> 01:33:18,662
Maybe very warm.

1303
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:20,867
I can't hold my head up anymore.

1304
01:33:21,001 --> 01:33:23,242
Hold this.

1305
01:33:26,797 --> 01:33:29,039
<i>Jump! Let him fuckin' go!</i>

1306
01:33:29,175 --> 01:33:31,464
- Let him die!
- Let him go!

1307
01:33:31,594 --> 01:33:34,085
So, Frank.

1308
01:33:34,222 --> 01:33:38,172
Am I gonna live?

1309
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,978
- You're gonna live.
- Frank.

1310
01:33:41,103 --> 01:33:43,808
That ten dollars
you owe me?

1311
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:46,098
- Yeah?
- Keep it.

1312
01:33:46,234 --> 01:33:48,807
I've been thinkin'
about things, you know?

1313
01:33:48,944 --> 01:33:52,644
<i>Oh, you guys gave me lots of time</i>
<i>to meditate on the future.</i>

1314
01:33:52,781 --> 01:33:54,655
What'd you do, huh?
Stop for Chinese on the way over here?

1315
01:33:54,783 --> 01:33:58,117
I was tired.
I needed a coffee.

1316
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,953
What about Kanita?

1317
01:34:02,082 --> 01:34:04,205
Dead.

1318
01:34:08,881 --> 01:34:13,542
That's, uh...
That's too bad.

1319
01:34:13,677 --> 01:34:17,011
Hmm.
See, Frank,

1320
01:34:17,139 --> 01:34:20,638
make some money,
fine-lookin' lady on your arm,

1321
01:34:20,767 --> 01:34:23,305
then everybody wants
to take a piece.

1322
01:34:23,436 --> 01:34:26,520
Yeah,
there's some kid...

1323
01:34:26,647 --> 01:34:29,103
who I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes,
comes to the Oasis,

1324
01:34:29,234 --> 01:34:31,273
starts shootin' at me.

1325
01:34:31,403 --> 01:34:35,696
The Red Death Gang.
Bunch of 12-year-olds.

1326
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,654
I thought I could make it
on the balcony, like Tiger.

1327
01:34:41,161 --> 01:34:44,281
But he's fat. Falls faster.
That's why.

1328
01:34:44,415 --> 01:34:46,906
I'm tryin' to watch my weight,
and look what happens.

1329
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:52,954
<i>Goddam, that's hot!</i>

1330
01:34:53,091 --> 01:34:56,293
Bring it on! Bring it on!

1331
01:34:56,426 --> 01:34:59,131
You can't kill me,
duck-ass kids!

1332
01:34:59,262 --> 01:35:02,845
Oh, yeah.

1333
01:35:02,974 --> 01:35:07,304
Ooh. Look at that.
Look at that.

1334
01:35:07,437 --> 01:35:11,815
Look at that.
Hey, isn't that beautiful?

1335
01:35:11,942 --> 01:35:14,563
Isn't that beautiful?

1336
01:35:18,405 --> 01:35:21,490
Oh, when the fires
start to fall,

1337
01:35:21,617 --> 01:35:24,702
them that's strongest
rule it all!

1338
01:35:24,829 --> 01:35:26,703
Oh!

1339
01:35:26,831 --> 01:35:31,126
I love this city!

1340
01:35:53,482 --> 01:35:57,065
Good thing we clipped you in,
huh, Frank?

1341
01:35:57,194 --> 01:35:59,103
What about me?
Who buckled me in?

1342
01:35:59,238 --> 01:36:01,112
- I thought you did.
- Nah, I thought you did.

1343
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,113
- I'm sorry about that, sir.
- Yeah, right.

1344
01:36:03,241 --> 01:36:06,196
<i>Aah!</i>
<i>Stop jerkin' my pole!</i>

1345
01:36:10,873 --> 01:36:13,494
<i>I-I got a fence up my ass, all</i>
<i>right? I need something for the pain.</i>

1346
01:36:13,626 --> 01:36:15,500
<i>We'll get you another sedative.</i>

1347
01:36:15,628 --> 01:36:18,712
<i>And somebody'll be by to take you to the</i>
<i>O.R., hopefully sometime this morning.</i>

1348
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,916
<i>Hopefully?</i>
<i>Hopefully sometime this morning?</i>

1349
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:23,802
<i>Oh, Frank.</i>
<i>Frank. Psst.</i>

1350
01:36:25,972 --> 01:36:27,845
You saved my life.

1351
01:36:29,808 --> 01:36:31,884
Yeah, I know.

1352
01:36:32,019 --> 01:36:34,724
<i>Nurse Crupp, we're gonna need</i>
<i>some Valium here. He's waking up again.</i>

1353
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:37,477
- Where's that Valium?
<i>- Coming.</i>

1354
01:36:37,608 --> 01:36:42,151
Frank, give me a hand over here.
I gotta get something between his teeth.

1355
01:36:42,279 --> 01:36:45,814
<i>- Don't! Don't do it!</i>
- Valium's in.

1356
01:36:48,784 --> 01:36:50,742
How many times
have you shocked him tonight?

1357
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:54,239
Fourteen. Finally got him
a room up in I.C.U.

1358
01:36:54,374 --> 01:36:56,746
He should be up there
in a couple hours.

1359
01:36:56,876 --> 01:37:01,254
What are you gonna do,
just have somebody follow him
around with a defibrillator?

1360
01:37:01,381 --> 01:37:04,169
That's a good one, Frank. No,
but we might surgically implant one...

1361
01:37:04,301 --> 01:37:06,293
around the shoulder over here,
'bout the size of my thumb.

1362
01:37:06,428 --> 01:37:08,919
Two electrodes
connected to the heart.

1363
01:37:09,055 --> 01:37:10,928
Sends a shock
whenever he needs it.

1364
01:37:11,057 --> 01:37:15,599
Or we could just send him home with a
defibrillator. He could do it himself.

1365
01:37:41,045 --> 01:37:43,749
Look.

1366
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:48,958
Last night I was weak,
and it won't happen again.

1367
01:37:49,093 --> 01:37:53,886
All that shit I was sayin'
was just 'cause I was stoned.

1368
01:37:54,974 --> 01:37:56,883
- Just forget it.
- No problem.

1369
01:37:58,936 --> 01:38:01,344
Thanks for letting me crash.

1370
01:38:01,481 --> 01:38:04,267
It was the best sleep
I've had in months.

1371
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,650
I used some of your soap.

1372
01:38:07,778 --> 01:38:10,104
<i>Did you see my father?</i>

1373
01:38:12,867 --> 01:38:14,991
You know, the doctor said
that, uh,

1374
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,575
that his brain's
startin' to come around.

1375
01:38:17,705 --> 01:38:20,871
They're just waitin' for
his heart to stabilize.

1376
01:38:20,999 --> 01:38:24,498
<i>I don't know who to believe.</i>

1377
01:38:24,627 --> 01:38:27,545
Can I bring you back
something to eat?

1378
01:38:27,672 --> 01:38:30,080
A falafel
or some pizza?

1379
01:38:32,428 --> 01:38:34,966
No, we just ate.

1380
01:38:35,097 --> 01:38:38,881
<i>I keep thinking about</i>
<i>how tough my father was.</i>

1381
01:38:39,018 --> 01:38:42,432
Now I know
he had to be like that...

1382
01:38:42,562 --> 01:38:44,436
to make us tough.

1383
01:38:46,107 --> 01:38:48,266
'Cause this city,

1384
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:53,604
it'll kill you
if you aren't strong enough.

1385
01:38:55,409 --> 01:38:57,816
No, the city
doesn't discriminate.

1386
01:38:57,953 --> 01:39:01,487
It gets everybody.

1387
01:39:04,124 --> 01:39:07,161
I gotta go.
Another call.

1388
01:39:13,384 --> 01:39:16,421
We're all dying,
Mary Burke.

1389
01:39:43,622 --> 01:39:46,077
<i>Get ready, Frank.</i>

1390
01:39:46,208 --> 01:39:49,125
Missed a drug shooting while you were
dicking around in there.

1391
01:39:49,252 --> 01:39:51,126
Gonna be trauma tonight, baby.

1392
01:39:51,254 --> 01:39:53,377
As long as we keep moving.
No standing still.

1393
01:39:57,176 --> 01:39:59,632
Look at your screen!
Give us some blood!

1394
01:39:59,762 --> 01:40:01,802
<i>66-Xray, a man</i>
<i>at the bus terminal...</i>

1395
01:40:01,931 --> 01:40:04,682
<i>shot three years ago</i>
<i>says his arm hurts.</i>

1396
01:40:32,169 --> 01:40:34,659
Come on, Tom.
Pick up a job.

1397
01:40:34,796 --> 01:40:37,631
You want some bum in the bus terminal?
We'll wait for a real call.

1398
01:40:37,757 --> 01:40:39,796
- Let's get in a fight then.
That's your job.
- Who with?

1399
01:40:39,925 --> 01:40:43,544
Just keep driving. Keep moving.
No stopping. We're sharks.
We stop too long, we die.

1400
01:40:45,974 --> 01:40:49,141
Let's break something, Tom. Let's
bust something! Let's bomb something!

1401
01:40:49,269 --> 01:40:51,676
- What do you wanna break?
- I don't know.
Let's break some windows!

1402
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:54,268
- Why?
- Destruction! Distraction!
I feel the need!

1403
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:57,399
You need a reason, Frank. You just don't
go around breaking people's windows.

1404
01:40:57,526 --> 01:41:00,527
- That's anarchy.
- What's the reason, Tom?
Give me a reason.

1405
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:03,525
All right, let me think.
Oh, look at this.

1406
01:41:03,658 --> 01:41:06,908
Classic cabby move.
Hey, swami!

1407
01:41:07,036 --> 01:41:10,072
It's called a crosswalk! You're
supposed to stop before it, not on it!

1408
01:41:10,206 --> 01:41:13,621
<i>You Senegalian raghead!</i>
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

1409
01:41:26,221 --> 01:41:28,758
I know who to work over.

1410
01:41:31,226 --> 01:41:33,349
Him!

1411
01:41:33,478 --> 01:41:37,523
<i>This guy's been terrorizin'</i>
<i>the neighborhood for weeks,</i>

1412
01:41:37,649 --> 01:41:40,400
ever since he got out of jail,
wreaking general havoc,

1413
01:41:40,526 --> 01:41:42,400
contributing to
the bad name of the place.

1414
01:41:42,529 --> 01:41:46,607
<i>You know, the term "menace to society"</i>
<i>was made up for him!</i>

1415
01:41:48,575 --> 01:41:51,066
- He's crazy. He can't help it.
- Oh, yeah?

1416
01:41:51,203 --> 01:41:53,908
Well, why don't they
put him away?

1417
01:41:54,039 --> 01:41:56,495
Prisons don't want him.

1418
01:41:56,625 --> 01:42:00,042
I took him to the hospital yesterday.
I gave him a cup of water.

1419
01:42:00,171 --> 01:42:02,330
I was very nice to him.
And here he is again.

1420
01:42:02,465 --> 01:42:04,919
<i>Oh! Look at that!</i>

1421
01:42:05,049 --> 01:42:07,126
Tell me
that's a crazy person.

1422
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,549
Huh? Every move
is calculated!

1423
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:12,515
He knows exactly
what he is doing.

1424
01:42:12,641 --> 01:42:15,726
Frank,
this is the guy.

1425
01:42:15,853 --> 01:42:18,522
I've been after him for weeks.
He's quick, though.

1426
01:42:18,648 --> 01:42:21,482
He runs like a rat.
He'd be tough for one person.

1427
01:42:21,608 --> 01:42:24,277
- But with the two of us, you know...
- Okay, what do I do?

1428
01:42:24,402 --> 01:42:26,310
Okay, I'm gonna
get out here.

1429
01:42:26,445 --> 01:42:29,018
If he sees me, he'll run.
He doesn't like me.

1430
01:42:29,156 --> 01:42:32,074
You start talkin' to him
about baseball or something.

1431
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:34,739
I'll sneak around behind him
and get down,

1432
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:36,745
and then you push him.

1433
01:42:36,873 --> 01:42:39,364
And when he falls,
we get him.

1434
01:42:39,501 --> 01:42:43,747
- That's ridiculous.
- Believe me, it always works.
The simpler, the better.

1435
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:47,000
Okay?

1436
01:42:47,133 --> 01:42:49,255
<i>Havin' fun now!</i>

1437
01:42:57,059 --> 01:42:59,265
That's a hell of a swing
you got there, Noel.

1438
01:42:59,395 --> 01:43:02,229
- I'm thinking Mattingly in his prime.
- Mattingly ain't shit.

1439
01:43:02,355 --> 01:43:04,977
Me, I swing like Reggie.

1440
01:43:05,108 --> 01:43:07,315
Huh? Mr. October,
number three.

1441
01:43:07,444 --> 01:43:09,318
Game six
of the World Series.

1442
01:43:09,446 --> 01:43:11,319
All right!

1443
01:43:11,447 --> 01:43:14,235
You hit it.
Come on, take a crack at it.

1444
01:43:14,367 --> 01:43:16,241
It's okay.

1445
01:43:18,664 --> 01:43:20,821
Come on, hit it!

1446
01:43:20,957 --> 01:43:23,875
I better not.

1447
01:43:24,002 --> 01:43:26,291
Go ahead.
Give it a go.

1448
01:43:26,421 --> 01:43:28,627
Try it.

1449
01:43:28,756 --> 01:43:30,665
Yeah?

1450
01:43:33,218 --> 01:43:35,923
Okay.
What the hell.

1451
01:43:36,055 --> 01:43:40,218
The next year, tiebreaker
for the division in Boston.

1452
01:43:40,350 --> 01:43:44,265
<i>The Yanks down two to nothing.</i>
<i>Bucky Dent steps to the plate.</i>

1453
01:43:44,396 --> 01:43:46,638
- Lucky-Fucky-Bucky, man.
- The pitch: high heater.

1454
01:43:46,774 --> 01:43:49,692
Bucky knows what's comin'.
He steps in.

1455
01:43:49,819 --> 01:43:53,947
Smash! Over the Green Monster!
Yeah!

1456
01:43:54,074 --> 01:43:57,655
Frank!
What the...

1457
01:43:57,784 --> 01:44:01,117
<i>What the hell are you doin'?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

1458
01:44:01,245 --> 01:44:05,492
Now get down those stairs
and go after him!

1459
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:07,950
You meet me back here in ten minutes
if you can't find him.

1460
01:44:08,086 --> 01:44:10,791
<i>Call out if you see him!</i>
<i>Remember, he runs like a rat!</i>

1461
01:44:10,922 --> 01:44:15,086
Come on, Frank!
Get with the programme, man!

1462
01:46:05,117 --> 01:46:08,236
<i>Why did you kill me, Frank?</i>

1463
01:46:10,996 --> 01:46:13,832
I didn't mean to.

1464
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:16,246
<i>You should've helped me.</i>

1465
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:20,291
I tried to help.
I wanted to.

1466
01:46:25,511 --> 01:46:27,384
Rose?

1467
01:46:27,512 --> 01:46:30,929
<i>- Don't you love me?</i>
- Rose.

1468
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:36,517
Rose?

1469
01:46:45,822 --> 01:46:48,989
To the moon, Alice!
Little motherfucker!

1470
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:54,453
- Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
- What the fuck?

1471
01:46:54,581 --> 01:46:56,656
- Get the kit!
- Frank!

1472
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:59,116
You're gonna be all right, Noel.
We're gonna save you. Do it, Tom!

1473
01:46:59,252 --> 01:47:01,494
I'll call for fuckin' backup!
I swear!

1474
01:47:01,629 --> 01:47:05,840
You'd call for fuckin' backup?
Fuck you!

1475
01:47:07,843 --> 01:47:11,094
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.

1476
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:46,164
<i>Let him through!</i>

1477
01:47:49,718 --> 01:47:52,007
Let him through.
Bring him through.

1478
01:47:52,137 --> 01:47:54,628
Who got that funky
motherfucker this time?

1479
01:47:54,765 --> 01:47:57,054
Last show of the night.

1480
01:47:57,184 --> 01:48:00,349
<i>What do you got?</i>
<i>What... Oh, boy.</i>

1481
01:48:00,477 --> 01:48:03,478
- Oh, boy. Nurse Crupp!
Anybody else hurt?
- No.

1482
01:48:03,605 --> 01:48:05,479
Get him over by
the counter over there.

1483
01:48:05,607 --> 01:48:08,561
- All right, we're gonna need
an X ray for a C-spine.
- Got it.

1484
01:48:08,694 --> 01:48:11,232
I'm gonna need
respiratory down here.

1485
01:48:11,363 --> 01:48:14,151
<i>Crazy bastard.</i>
<i>At least he's intubated.</i>

1486
01:48:14,283 --> 01:48:16,490
<i>- Won't hear him screamin' tonight.</i>
<i>- People, hear me out.</i>

1487
01:48:16,619 --> 01:48:20,782
<i>Now, the path to your well-being and</i>
<i>salvation will not be over Griss' body.</i>

1488
01:48:20,914 --> 01:48:24,498
<i>You can forget about that,</i>
<i>'cause Griss gets off in 47 minutes.</i>

1489
01:48:24,627 --> 01:48:27,331
Then he's goin' home to take a bath.
Nice warm bath...

1490
01:48:27,462 --> 01:48:29,372
Nurse Crupp, I'm gonna need
another line here.

1491
01:48:29,506 --> 01:48:32,506
<i>Fine. One second. Here you are.</i>

1492
01:48:32,634 --> 01:48:35,754
Notify CAT scan. We're gonna need
a C.T. right away. Welcome home, buddy.

1493
01:48:35,887 --> 01:48:39,552
<i>Oh, look who we have. You're</i>
<i>gonna have to start paying rent here.</i>

1494
01:48:39,682 --> 01:48:41,556
<i>- Where are you puttin' him?</i>
<i>- Three.</i>

1495
01:48:41,684 --> 01:48:44,092
<i>Give me some gloves, please.</i>
<i>Nurse, call CAT scan.</i>

1496
01:48:44,229 --> 01:48:46,981
- Tell 'em we'll be there
in a couple minutes.
- I got it.

1497
01:49:07,334 --> 01:49:09,873
Is Patrick Burke here?
I brought him in.

1498
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:46,573
<i>- Frank?</i>
- Yes?

1499
01:49:46,706 --> 01:49:49,826
<i>Where have you been?</i>

1500
01:49:52,002 --> 01:49:53,876
What is it?

1501
01:49:56,465 --> 01:49:58,339
<i>Let me go.</i>

1502
01:51:40,358 --> 01:51:42,316
Code!

1503
01:51:52,828 --> 01:51:55,116
<i>- What's this?</i>
<i>- He just coded.</i>

1504
01:51:55,246 --> 01:51:57,453
<i>- What a way to begin the day.</i>
<i>Are we doing C.P. R?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

1505
01:51:57,582 --> 01:51:59,540
<i>One mil epi.</i>
<i>Let me see this.</i>

1506
01:51:59,668 --> 01:52:02,871
<i>- Is this the man who was down</i>
<i>in the E.R. for so long?</i>
<i>- Yes, it is.</i>

1507
01:52:03,004 --> 01:52:05,495
<i>Seventeen codes.</i>
<i>My God.</i>

1508
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:08,301
<i>- Who's this man?</i>
<i>- He says he's the one</i>
<i>who brought him in.</i>

1509
01:52:08,427 --> 01:52:10,135
The family?

1510
01:52:10,262 --> 01:52:13,096
<i>Seventeen codes.</i>

1511
01:52:13,223 --> 01:52:15,429
<i>Well, they must be prepared.</i>

1512
01:52:15,558 --> 01:52:17,551
You know how they can be.

1513
01:52:17,686 --> 01:52:19,595
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1514
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:27,484
Okay, stop C.P.R.

1515
01:52:34,576 --> 01:52:36,450
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>I'm calling it. 6:02.</i>

1516
01:52:36,578 --> 01:52:40,077
<i>Are you gonna</i>
<i>tell the family?</i>

1517
01:52:50,384 --> 01:52:53,255
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

1518
01:52:53,388 --> 01:52:57,005
Son of a bitch!
Die! Die!

1519
01:52:57,141 --> 01:53:00,011
<i>Die! Die!</i>
<i>Die! Die!</i>

1520
01:53:00,143 --> 01:53:02,847
<i>Bastard!</i>

1521
01:53:11,112 --> 01:53:14,197
Who is it?

1522
01:53:14,324 --> 01:53:16,815
- Frank.
- Oh, come on up.

1523
01:53:27,754 --> 01:53:29,628
Hi.

1524
01:53:31,675 --> 01:53:33,798
He's dead, Mary.

1525
01:53:33,927 --> 01:53:36,381
Your father passed.

1526
01:53:39,056 --> 01:53:42,471
They just moved him
to the second floor, to I.C.U.

1527
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,842
He coded.

1528
01:53:44,978 --> 01:53:48,762
They shocked him too many times.
I'm sorry.

1529
01:53:55,905 --> 01:53:59,072
I don't know how he held on
as long as he did.

1530
01:54:01,912 --> 01:54:03,537
I'm sorry.

1531
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:11,164
You have to keep
the body going...

1532
01:54:11,295 --> 01:54:15,079
until the brain and heart
recover enough to go on their own.

1533
01:54:23,975 --> 01:54:26,512
Forgive me, Rose.

1534
01:54:29,689 --> 01:54:31,681
It's not your fault.

1535
01:54:31,816 --> 01:54:35,018
No one asked you to suffer.

1536
01:54:35,152 --> 01:54:37,690
That was your idea.

1537
01:54:48,249 --> 01:54:50,702
Noel was almost killed.

1538
01:54:50,833 --> 01:54:53,039
I took care of him.

1539
01:54:53,169 --> 01:54:55,541
He's gonna pull through.

1540
01:54:59,926 --> 01:55:01,883
Would you like to come in?
