1
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,436
Hey, uh, is Juanita in?

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,795
No, she's not,
but she'll be back in a...

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,711
in a while.

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,952
So you gonna stand out there,
or you comin' in?

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,871
I'm gonna come on in.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,550
Girl, check you out.

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,076
I thought you were goin' over
to the communists.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,550
Ah. Nah. Not me.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,069
Now, dig, if you were smart,
that's what you would've done.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,156
What?

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,874
Man, you don't know what the hell
you talkin' about, girl.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,913
No, it's cool. I mean it's not your
fault you been brainwashed by America.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,159
I mean, at least you made it back
alive, right?

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,511
You know, "Hello, how you doin'?"
That would've been real nice...

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,712
before you got off
onto all this political shit.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,518
Welcome home.

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,949
And welcome to the revolution.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,032
- So, this is Sarah's?
- Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,751
Oh, wow.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,432
- So, is she a smart baby?
- Ahh.

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,670
Why don't you find out for yourself?

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,718
Hey, y'all. Sorry I'm late.
Traffic on the Cross Bronx was a mess.

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,149
Oh. All righty.

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,350
There we go.

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,198
There you go.

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,709
Go play with your blocks.
Go play with your blocks.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,031
Hey.

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,833
Oh, no. Look, Juanita.
I'm in one piece.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,877
Hey, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,595
Come here, Sarah.
Come to Mommy.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,713
Good girl. Come here.
Look at that.

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,308
- That's Daddy. Say hi.
- Hi.

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,670
This is Sarah Marie Curtis.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,791
- Hi.
- Hello.

35
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,559
Hold her, silly. She's yours.

36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,437
Oh.

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,869
Hey. Mmm.

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,908
Hey, um...

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,316
Oh, yeah. Be advised.
What's goin' on, my brothers?

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,633
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah. This is home.

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,149
Dig it. Dig it.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,992
Check out Sleepin' Beauty
back there.

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,278
Boy, I still can't get over
how gorgeous she is.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,231
Oh, she got that from her mama.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,237
Oh. Okay.

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,028
You know, Juanita...

47
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,836
I wanna let you know l...
I did miss you. A lot.

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,315
Don't you think I know that, Anthony?

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,109
It's not important anyway. The important
thing is that you're here now.

50
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,515
Shh. Come here.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,472
Oh.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,751
Hey, baby girl.

53
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,110
Hey, Cutty.

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,749
Came by to see you a little earlier,
but you weren't home.

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,158
Oh, you know I had class tonight
after work...

56
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,316
and then I stopped over by my mother's.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,468
- Oh, yeah. I forgot. It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,949
I see my little girl's sleepin'
back there, huh?

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,838
Yeah. She's all played out.

60
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,350
- Cutty, I wanted you to meet, um...
- Look here.

61
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,829
- Got a little somethin' for Sarah.
- Smiling faces

62
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,590
- Buy her something real nice.
- Smiling faces sometimes

63
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,319
Hey, Cutty, I told you
to stop spoilin' her like this.

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,670
Smiling faces

65
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,196
Smiling faces tell lies

66
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,590
- Somebody's gotta do it.
- And I got proof

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,633
- Beware
- Cutty, I want you to meet Anthony.

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,353
Okay. All right.

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,358
Let me just put her to bed. You come on
in and make yourself at home.

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,277
Come on in.

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,273
Okay. Can I get you something
to drink, or...

72
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,830
Look, Juanita.
Uh, I think I better go.

73
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,030
But you just got here.

74
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,715
Who knows, you could be
expectin' company or something.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,030
Nobody's comin' here, Anthony.

76
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,957
I think I still should go.

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,069
Anthony.

78
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,515
I used to see Cutty.
Is that what you wanna hear?

79
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,273
Oh. Blood made that very clear to me.

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,391
So then, what's the problem?

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,715
Problem?

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,554
Why, man throwed two yards on your car.

83
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,677
You askin' me what's the problem?
Shit. Obviously nothin'.

84
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,677
Don't come up in here judgin' me.

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,360
What the fuck, man?
You got a pimp around my daughter?

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,158
Oh, he is not a pimp.

87
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,396
And besides, if you cared anything
about havin' a daughter...

88
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,988
you'd have wrote me back
after I sent you our picture.

89
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,076
But don't jump on me
for havin' a life.

90
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,395
You didn't want one with me.

91
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,317
So now what?

92
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,273
Are you gonna leave?

93
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,197
Some bullshit.

94
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,436
Come here.

95
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
Come on. Come here.

96
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,231
Ooh, hey

97
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,280
Ya gotta, gotta payback
Payback

98
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,516
- Damn!
- Revenge

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,594
A man
The big payback

100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,597
Got to get back

101
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,836
Cleanup time, Cowboy.

102
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,270
See, man, why the fuck
you always gotta talk some shit?

103
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,790
Payback
Right there

104
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,912
- See, that's why I kicked his fuckin'
ass when he was a little kid, man.
- Payback

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,675
- Always gettin' smart and shit.
- A man

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,189
Get down with my girlfriend

107
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,114
That ain't right

108
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,754
Now you gonna play this marine
war hero.

109
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,950
Out of touch

110
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,076
You know what I think?

111
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,794
- I think y'all was some goddam fools
goin' over there...
- Gonna fight

112
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,388
fightin' that white man's war.

113
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,398
- That's right.
- Payback everything you got to see

114
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,552
- What you got when you get
back here, huh?
- Yeah

115
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,029
- Never do any damn thing
- Not a goddam thing.

116
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,399
Course, you do got
that fine-ass Juanita.

117
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,631
- Throw me out
- Now, what the fuck you lookin' at me
like that for, man?

118
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,239
I'm just complimentin' you
on your taste.

119
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,717
Throw me away
You had all the rage

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,792
- You had me down
- Course you know...

121
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,911
- That's the facts
- Baddest motherfucker this side
of Nicky Barnes...

122
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,270
- Now, you punk
- My boss man Cutty...

123
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,834
Gettin' ready for the big payback

124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,712
I thought that might ring a bell.

125
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,990
The big payback
That's where I learned

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,430
He used to tap that ass
while you was over in Nam.

127
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,351
- The big payback
- Motherfucker!

128
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,592
- Goddam!
- You do some fuckin' talkin',
don't you, goddam it!

129
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,438
Try this on, motherfucker.

130
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,034
- No, no, no. He needs his ass whipped.
- What you mean "no"?

131
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,951
Get the fuck outta here!
Talk shit now, huh, motherfucker?

132
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,032
- Shut the fuck up. Come on. Come on.
Motherfucker. Now what?
- I'm ready to be respected

133
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,515
You wanna fuck with me or what?
I'm gonna fuckin' kill your ass!

134
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,154
- Say somethin' now, motherfucker.
- That's enough, youngblood.

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,358
- Pull out your goddam knife!
- No! That's enough. Come on!

136
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,232
- I gonna kill this motherfucker!
- That's enough!

137
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,117
That mother! I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker!

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,668
- Let me go, Kirby! Let me go!
- No. He's already beat up. Come on now.

139
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,356
- Oh, shit.
- Come on. Let's go get some air.

140
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,755
Don't need no fuckin' air!
Let me go!

141
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,035
- Let me hit him, hit him, hit him
- That's game.

142
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,511
Shit.

143
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,034
Gonna have the aeroplane corn bread.

144
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,475
Here we go.
Ooh!

145
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,028
- You gonna spoil that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,799
Gonna spoil that one in your belly too.

147
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,718
I don't need no spoiled kids.

148
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,711
Hey, why not?

149
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,558
Not enough black babies are spoiled.

150
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,995
Ain't that right, Sarah, hmm?

151
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,872
You got a point there.

152
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,956
Come on. Sit on down.

153
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,873
Big girl. Come here.

154
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,357
Come here.

155
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,280
Look at you.

156
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,476
Fat girl.

157
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,028
See what we got ourselves here.

158
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,078
Oh, you know what? I think we're gonna
have ourselves a little boy.

159
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,594
Yeah, come on, man.
You got to be a boy.

160
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,473
Boy, boy, boy. Mm.

161
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,037
Ant Junior.
See, it's the power of the mind.

162
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,549
We will ourselves a little boy.

163
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,670
Then can you will yourself
a better job?

164
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,628
Can you will yourself to stop
drinkin' so much?

165
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,513
Come on, honey.
Don't even start that shit, all right?

166
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,712
I thought we supposed to be havin'
a nice time here.

167
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,478
Look, Juanita.

168
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,518
l-I'm gonna get myself
a... a good job.

169
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,354
You know how long you been singin'
that same old song now, Anthony?

170
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,079
I mean, in case you haven't noticed,
this here's the real world.

171
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,475
Ain't no free meals here
like in the marines.

172
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,710
Say, let me tell you somethin'.
Wasn't nothin' free in the marines.

173
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,519
I earned every meal
and every fuckin' dollar, all right?

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,831
Look, everything's gonna be cool.

175
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,634
You know I'll be
five months next week.

176
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,877
You're five months pregnant,
you can't be no nurse's aide.

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,797
I said we'll be all right.

178
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,473
Hey, um... Anybody want some speed?

179
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,194
Get the fuck outta here
with that shit.

180
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,595
Say, why don't you
cut the bullshit, Joe?

181
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,518
Can't you clear your mind
for one sec, man?

182
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,670
Now, you sure that they
pick up cash money?

183
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,631
Hey, cash money, bro.

184
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,069
Like clockwork, once a month.
Then they stop by the post office...

185
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,311
before they make their final run
to Washington, man.

186
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,233
All the way to Washington, D.C.,
where they burn the money.

187
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,430
Can you believe that shit?

188
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,988
Old bills, man.
Sometimes a couple million.

189
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,038
- How many guards?
- Four.

190
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,634
Two in the front
and one in the back carry revolvers.

191
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,231
The other one, 12-gauge shotgun, man.

192
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,038
You think we can take 'em?

193
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,712
I can't say, man.
I mean...

194
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,792
four guards, and all of 'em
packin'?

195
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,589
I put up the guns. I get the money
together to get the plans goin'.

196
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,597
But you got to be the master planner.

197
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,148
You got medals for blowin'
motherfuckers up out there.

198
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,353
- Man, I heard you were like John Wayne.
- Well, then that's the deal.

199
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,550
Yeah, all that money.

200
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,477
Ah, man.

201
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,398
Anthony. You down?

202
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,277
- Ahh.
- The look

203
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,398
- Of love
- Let's drink on it anyway.

204
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,792
- Is in your eyes
- Mmm.

205
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,271
- Ahh.
- A look

206
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,311
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Your heart

207
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,399
- Say, man. Shhh.
- Can't disguise
- Hmm?

208
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,069
Put the goddam thing away.
Get your little pyromaniac ass...

209
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,833
- You gonna be walkin' in a minute.
- Aw, cool out, Kirby, man.

210
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,554
I'm not gonna burn your car.
Not yet, at least.

211
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,437
Don't go

212
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,835
Forget it, Juanita.

213
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,751
Come on. Watch out there.

214
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,516
The look of love

215
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,874
What's the problem, Anthony?

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,549
What is it? I mean,
is it because I'm pregnant?

217
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,352
Shh. Come on.
Now, don't be silly.

218
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,271
So, then what's the problem?

219
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,117
Come on. Talk to me.
What is it?

220
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,719
I told you. You need to
leave that alcohol alone.

221
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,273
- No! No!
- Anthony! Anthony, baby!

222
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,396
It's me.
It's me. It's all right.

223
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,311
It's all right.
Come here.

224
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,871
Shh. Shh. Shh.
It's just another dream.

225
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,797
It's just another dream.

226
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,390
This is my best cut,
Mrs Stein. Enjoy.

227
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,954
Thank you very much, Saul.

228
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,629
- He's such a nice man.
- What did he give you?

229
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,716
- We need to talk.
- Oh.

230
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,478
- So what's happenin'?
- You're a good man.

231
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,269
Aw, come on, Saul.
I ain't got time to kibitz with ya.
I got a whole lot of meat to cut.

232
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,231
I'm closing down the shop.

233
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,840
Should've told you sooner,
but I thought maybe...

234
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,388
business, you know,
pick up a little.

235
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,632
Sorry.

236
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,596
- Here.
- Oh, no, look, Saul... No. I can't.

237
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,553
What am I gonna do with it?
I have to get rid of it.

238
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,278
Come on.

239
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,591
Now I know

240
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,309
We have great respect

241
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,193
For the sister and mother

242
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,117
It's even better yet

243
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,948
But there's the joker in the street

244
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,914
Here you go, brother.
Don't let the bullshit get to you.

245
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,831
I'm tryin', man. I'm tryin'.

246
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,036
You wanna get the man's foot
off your neck?

247
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,873
Come check us out.

248
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,719
Take care of yourself, brother.
Live righteous.

249
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,115
Here you go, brother.
Here you go.

250
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,152
Take care of yourself, brother.
Come see us now.

251
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,350
Don't let us hang around this town

252
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,558
- Here you go, sister.
- And let what others say come true

253
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,193
Brothers and sisters, here you go.

254
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,272
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Hey, youngblood.

255
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,318
Bringin' in the groceries, huh?

256
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,189
Lord, have mercy.

257
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,880
Man, I remember
when I was married.

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,037
I used to love
to bring home the groceries.

259
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,509
Made me feel real good.

260
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,519
Like a man. Know what I mean?

261
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,518
Hey, listen, youngblood. Uh...

262
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,517
I just dropped by
to see Juanita and Sarah.

263
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,518
- You know, lay a little
somethin' on 'em.
- Stopped by to see my baby?

264
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,232
Is that right?

265
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,157
You know, youngblood...

266
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,158
I took care of your woman and your baby
when you were in the war.

267
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,550
Now, a man oughta get a little respect
for somethin' like that.

268
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,312
Now, I ain't gonna lie to you.

269
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,676
I care about Juanita.
I care about her a whole lot.

270
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,639
But you back now, and I'm gone.

271
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,235
So from this point on, you should
consider me like a friend of the family.

272
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,430
Find yourself in a jam and shit,
need a little cash...

273
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,279
you come see me,
I'll front you.

274
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,715
- Keep your shit.
- Listen, brother.

275
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,950
I know about pride.

276
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,036
But you got mouths to feed.

277
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,991
Now, I laid a little cash
on Juanita.

278
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,839
Say, man, stay the fuck
away from my family.

279
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,478
What did you say?

280
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,955
You heard me, goddam it.

281
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,996
I said, "Stay the fuck away
from my family."

282
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,792
See, I ain't the enemy, youngblood.

283
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,556
I don't want no trouble.

284
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,351
Shit.

285
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,036
See, I tried to be a friend,
motherfucker.

286
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,231
Surprise, nigger.

287
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,398
Big bad marines.

288
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,311
Look at you now.

289
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,874
Does she suck you?

290
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,479
Fuck you?

291
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,120
Make you feel like a man?

292
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,031
Make you feel real good?

293
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,679
Huh, boy?

294
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,553
Now, she wasn't doin' it like that
before you went to the war, now was she?

295
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,196
Now you gettin'
all that good lovin'...

296
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,160
and you can't even put food
on your fuckin' table.

297
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,350
Come on, Santa Claus.
Open your mouth and suck this.

298
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,954
Come on. I got a present for you.
Suck it!

299
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,470
- Suck it, nigger!
- Kill me, motherfucker.

300
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,437
Shoot me right now.

301
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,312
What you gonna do, shoot me?

302
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,478
You lucky this is personal, nigger.

303
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,670
I ain't gonna kill you
over no woman.

304
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,751
Don't you ever...

305
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,791
in your fuckin' life...

306
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,388
bite the hand
that feeds you, nigger.

307
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,395
See ya, Santa Claus.

308
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,835
- Hold still now.
- I'm all right.

309
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,235
- Hold still.
- No, I'm all right. Damn!

310
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,193
You givin' him that money back.

311
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,635
He won't take it back.

312
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,753
What the fuck you talkin'...
You better get his shit back to him!

313
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,714
Even if I wanted to give it back to him,
Anthony, he wouldn't take it back.

314
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,634
W-W-W-Wait. What the fuck you talkin'
about, "if you wanted to give it back"?

315
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,432
No, no, no, no.
Fuck that shit.

316
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,956
Have you forgotten you just lost your
damn job? We need that fuckin' money.

317
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,679
- We don't need his money.
- Yeah, well, Anthony,
I'll tell you what.

318
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,992
You start bringin' some real money
in here, like a real man, and then
I'll think about givin' it back to him.

319
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,470
Until then, I don't wanna hear shit.

320
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,196
You need to get your tight ass together,
that's what you need to do, and stop
feelin' sorry for your damn self.

321
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,029
Sometimes it's like you ain't even
the same man I knew before the war.

322
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,072
That's who I was in love with.
That's who I thought showed
the fuck back up here.

323
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,953
I don't know who the fuck you are.

324
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,759
So, what? You just, uh,
suck his dick so good...

325
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,838
he just start
throwin' money at you, right?

326
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,512
What is with you?

327
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,552
Why you so damn paranoid?
I ain't fuckin' him.

328
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,636
Not at this moment, you ain't. No.

329
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,398
But the motherfucker
ain't sniffin' around here...

330
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,193
tossin' money in your
motherfuckin' face for nothin'!

331
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,272
Yeah, well, I sleep with you
every night, don't I?

332
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,597
You know, Juanita,
that's a damn good question.

333
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,038
Come on. Go ahead.

334
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,754
Admit this shit, man. Be honest.
You fuckin' him, right?

335
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,269
- Is that what you wanna hear, Anthony?
That's what you wanna hear?
- Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.

336
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,994
Fine. I'm fuckin' him.

337
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,153
So, uh, whose baby is that?

338
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,429
D-Don't even answer that shit.

339
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,556
No, you right. I ain't gonna answer it.
I mean, shit. You Anthony.

340
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,950
You the big marine man with no damn job.
You know every fuckin' thing.

341
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,837
Answer this for me: If you think
I'm jivin' you so much, Anthony,
why the hell you with me? Huh?

342
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,708
Why the fuck you with me?
What, you think I need you?
Do you think I need this shit?

343
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,115
Fuck. You can't get a decent job,
you won't fuck me.

344
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,913
The only time I get to
hold you is when you're havin'
one of them silly-ass nightmares...

345
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,877
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

346
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,394
You don't know, girl.
You really don't know.

347
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,954
- Don't you fuckin' walk away from...
- You better get the fuck off of me!

348
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,878
- Don't walk away from me, Anthony.
- Let me go.

349
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,190
- Don't you... What about Sarah?
- I'll fuckin' kill you, girl!

350
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,676
Don't you ever run up on me! Ever!
Ever run up on me again!

351
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,349
I'll fuckin' kill you, Juanita!
Get the fuck off me!

352
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,271
Bunch of shit!

353
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,629
- Yeah!
- That's right. You can't trust them!

354
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,869
- Now, they send our men
off to Vietnam...
- That's what they do.

355
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,276
to fight for this
so-called democracy.

356
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,715
- That's right. Preach, sister.
- Yeah! Yeah!

357
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,751
But when they get back down
to the South Bronx...

358
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,877
and to Bed-Stuy and Harlem
and Watts, etc., etc...

359
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,594
shit is worse than ever.

360
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,669
- There is something
very sick about that.
- He's a devil.

361
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,552
That's right,
he's the devil.

362
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,710
That's right!

363
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,510
Go, sister! Go on!

364
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,154
- Power to the people!
- Power to the people!

365
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,192
- In 'n' out.
- Never, never gonna give you up

366
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,834
I'm never, ever gonna stop

367
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,229
Not the way
I feel about you

368
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,352
- Girl, I just can't live without you
- There you go.

369
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,710
- I'm never, ever gonna quit
- What can I get you, baby?

370
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,115
Anyway, so like I was sayin',
I ran into this brother...

371
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,117
and he, uh, gave me
this flyer.

372
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,350
So I figured I'd go over
and check it out.

373
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,434
And there you were, up there
talkin' that ol' righteous shit.

374
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,553
I'm just a college student
tryin' to do her part to rally
the people together.

375
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,832
But, dig, we need more
than talk. It's... It's time to do.

376
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,388
- Do what?
- Revolution.

377
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,438
Oh, wait a minute. See.
Y'all a little outta my league now.

378
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,590
Is that what you're gonna say
when the revolution comes?

379
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,553
W-When it's time
to pick up a gun?

380
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,471
What you know
about weapons?

381
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,351
I'm qualified
to handle a.45...

382
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,517
an M-16 rifle,
a.38-calibre pistol...

383
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,596
and a Russian AK-47.

384
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,797
An AK-47?

385
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,631
Why don't you join us?

386
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,433
A lot of brothers
from the war have.

387
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,518
Baby, I got enough
heavy shit to deal with.

388
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,871
- I got you, brother.
- Relax.

389
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,870
You're so uptight.

390
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,992
Damn, I got to make
some fuckin' bread.

391
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,918
I'm through
with your sister, but...

392
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,470
I still got to take care
of my baby girl, Sarah.

393
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,433
Shit, and the one
that's on the way.

394
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,949
Damn!

395
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,232
Look, anyway, uh, I got
this plan to make some money.

396
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,794
I want you to keep
this shit to yourself.

397
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,992
At 6:15 a.m., the truck
pulls outta the post office...

398
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,237
at 149th and Grand Concourse.

399
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,437
Now, it makes one stop
before it goes to D. C...

400
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,513
which is a mail drop-off
at First Federal Loan and Savings...

401
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,473
which is on Noble Street
and West.

402
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,391
Now, Kirby...

403
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,391
you're gonna position yourself
in a getaway car...

404
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,717
at the end of the corner,
where you can see everything.

405
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,873
Jose. Me and you gonna
position ourselves behind the bank...

406
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,431
underneath the left
and the right side of the loadin' dock.

407
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,553
Delilah, you're gonna position
yourself inside the Dumpster...

408
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,638
which is located directly across
from the loadin' dock.

409
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,034
Now, Skippy, I want you
to position yourself...

410
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,232
approximately ten feet
from the alleyway.

411
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,670
There, you post
a lookout.

412
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,591
We all know what to do
at the point of attack...

413
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,433
because we've gone
over that shit enough.

414
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,031
If anybody gets caught, you shut
the fuck up, and we'll keep your money.

415
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,594
Shh! Fuck that shit, man.

416
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,075
I'm telling you right now,
if I get caught...

417
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,674
- I'm shooting my fuckin' way out.
- Nigger, put that shit down.

418
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,519
I think we need another man
on the street with Skip.

419
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,392
Someone to cover
the other side.

420
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,313
- I agree.
- Oh, man! Hell, no!

421
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,351
We don't need no 'nother man.
Shit, I can see.

422
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,716
- Besides, we got too many
motherfuckers anyway.
- Fuck that shit, Kirby, man.

423
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,758
Everybody trusts
everybody here, right?

424
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,076
I can get somebody
from our organization.

425
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,159
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't want none of them
revolutionary niggers involved.

426
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,595
You can cut your eye at me
all you want to.

427
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,836
I ain't too keen on havin'
that broad up in here neither.

428
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,270
Well, you the one talkin' about
we need another man.
Make up your goddam mind.

429
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,119
You have somebody in mind,
Anthony?

430
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,755
We might as well put
a motherfuckin' ad in the paper.
Then we gonna get everybody.

431
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,553
Shit, ain't gonna be
no money left for a nigger.

432
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,068
Oh, yes! Y'all didn't know
your reverend was a gamblin' man?

433
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,159
A sinnin' man?

434
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,959
I was a man who maimed!

435
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,797
I was a man who killed!

436
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,232
We all know it was done
in the name of the wicked one.

437
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,108
The one that was
cast down from heaven.

438
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,550
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

439
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,958
I said y'all know
who I'm talkin' about!

440
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,640
Can I get a "hallelujah"
in this house of God?

441
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,790
Hallelujah!

442
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,433
Hallelujah!

443
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,870
Well, look here, man.
Skip is in. Period. All right?

444
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,555
I stand a lot to lose
if this thing blows up in my face.

445
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,592
The last time I saw him, he was
shooting poison in his veins.

446
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,592
Yeah, I know. Well, you know,
he's tryin' to shake that shit, man.

447
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,434
- He's still on drugs.
- And I still trust him
with my life, Cleon.

448
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,476
Remember that last battle?

449
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,431
He froze up.

450
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,996
For a minute.
Then h-he broke out of it.

451
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,517
And when he "broke out of it,"
Dugan was dead.

452
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,750
Come on, Cleon. You know that
could've happened to any of us.

453
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,435
Now either you in
or you out. Which one?

454
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,994
How much money did you say
was in that truck?

455
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,877
We still got
about 15 minutes.

456
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,269
I tell ya, I could've
used another cup of coffee.

457
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,197
Let's make this quick.

458
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,917
Bank security.

459
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,511
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

460
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,431
- Mornin'.
- Good mornin'.

461
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,196
Oh, f...

462
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,553
You waitin' on
the number 11 bus?

463
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,511
Yes.

464
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,518
I don't think
she runs this early.

465
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,997
I caught it the other morning,
uh, at this same time.

466
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,439
You sure about that?

467
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,591
Uh-huh.

468
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,831
- Let me check for you.
- No need to go to any trouble, Officer.

469
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,757
No, no, no.
No trouble at all, brother.

470
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,672
I see by that patch
on your jacket you were in recon.

471
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,839
I was a 5th marine. Always willin'
to help out a fellow leatherneck.

472
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,831
Brown on patrol.
Brown on patrol.

473
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,230
Requesting off-hour route check
on number 11.

474
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,788
Dispatch to Brown.
Hold for schedule.

475
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,711
That's a copy.

476
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,916
Do somethin', Cleon.

477
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,078
- Ambush! Ambush!
- Drop it, motherfucker!

478
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,588
What the hell?

479
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,558
Shit!

480
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,958
Joe! Come on. Let's move.

481
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,354
Oh, goddam it!

482
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,159
Fuck! Shit!

483
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,874
Oh, shit!

484
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,356
Anthony!

485
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,751
- Did you see that shit, man?
- Hey, what the fuck wrong with you?

486
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,155
- See the way the fuckin' doors
blew off, man?
- No, motherfucker!

487
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,515
Motherfuckin' Joe, you blew
the whole motherfuckin'
truck up, motherfucker!

488
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,034
- It blew up like that, man!
- That's how you fucked
your hand up last time!

489
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,549
You... And the money... You fucked up.
I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass!

490
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,069
Grab what you can, motherfucker,
before the whole thing burns!

491
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,151
Hey, Anthony and Delilah
gotta see this shit, man.

492
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,396
I'm gonna go get 'em!
Hey, Anthony!

493
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,749
You gotta see the shit I did, man.
I blew that shit up, man!

494
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,190
You gotta see it, man!
You gotta see the shit I did!

495
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,828
Let's get outta here.
Put the gun down. Put the gun down.

496
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,791
Come on, Delilah.
Let's get up. Up. Let's go.

497
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,599
Come on, bro.

498
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,518
We gotta go, man.

499
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,632
I can't...
I can't leave her.

500
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,518
You ain't gotta
leave her, bro...

501
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,989
'cause she's already gone.

502
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,519
Get up here!
Go on!

503
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,318
Unit 1004, do you copy?

504
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,516
Please respond.

505
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,428
Do you require assistance?
Do you copy?

506
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,750
Any available units
in the vicinity of Noble Street.

507
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,110
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three. Repeat.

508
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,196
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three.

509
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,033
God's not gonna
forgive me for this one.

510
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,153
I'll tell you what, Reverend.
With this kind of money, you can
buy your way into heaven.

511
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,479
That's where you're wrong, brother.

512
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,997
We done bought our way into hell.

513
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,993
The plain fact is that I promised
the Lord I would never sin like this.

514
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,791
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure
I even want any of this dirty money.

515
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,708
Well, I'll tell you what,
Reverend.

516
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,631
We'll find somethin'
to do with your share.

517
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,429
- Amen to that shit.
- No. No, no, no, no.

518
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,120
- I'll take the money.
- You lyin' sack o' shit.

519
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,237
I'm sure the Lord will find
another way for me to do my penance.

520
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,230
Just tell me
one thing, Cleon.

521
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,590
Why the fuck
you didn't grab the cop?

522
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,831
You killed him.
A young brother.

523
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,157
If you wouldn't have froze up like
a bitch, maybe I wouldn't have had
to do that shit, now wouldn't I?

524
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,310
Would y'all
shut the fuck up?

525
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,911
Man, Delilah. Shit.

526
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,077
Man, radio said they got
Joe's stupid ass.

527
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,749
Fucked it up.
The whole plan was fucked up.

528
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,352
We ain't do shit right
out there, man. Shit.

529
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,033
Y'all make sure that Jose's share
goes to Marisol and his kids.

530
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,076
- Walk on by
- Done.

531
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,152
Your junkie ass really
messed up out there.

532
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,872
Don't blame me
for your fuck-ups.

533
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,193
I told Anthony I didn't want nothin' to
do with a crazy, devil-filled junkie!

534
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,959
- What?
- You listenin' to me? Look at him.

535
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,158
- Oh, shit!
- Now say some more shit!

536
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,071
I'll knock your ass
right back down.

537
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,799
Fake-ass wanna-be preacher,
no-members-havin' motherfucker!

538
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,714
Why don't y'all stop actin'
like some fuckin' clowns?

539
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,673
You know, you niggers
sure is silly.

540
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,275
Now, you're standin' here fightin',
and we got over $300,000...

541
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,551
of cold, hard, unmarked U.S. cash
to split up five ways.

542
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,950
Let me tell ya somethin'.
You make me lose count again,
I'm gonna shoot me a motherfucker...

543
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,036
and then we gonna be splittin'
this thing up four ways, hear?

544
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,159
Man, I can't believe this.
They was gonna burn all this shit.

545
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,113
All this shit, and a nigger
can't even find a job.

546
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,428
Well, that's Uncle Sam
for you, baby.

547
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,357
Money to burn.

548
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,758
Police have issued an all-points
bulletin for the remaining...

549
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,671
...Reserve Bank
on Noble Street.

550
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,193
Faces painted skeleton white.

551
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,959
Cobra, request your status.
Over.

552
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,837
- Five federal security guards...
- Anthony!

553
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,599
- She's already gone.
- Do it. Kill me.

554
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,272
The bloody shootout erupted...
an armoured truck... explosives...

555
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,949
No, motherfuckin' Joe.
You blew the whole
motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

556
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,354
...the deaths of nine people.

557
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,876
The heroin ain't never
did nothin' to me.

558
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,235
...just moments away from the scene
of the crime... Robbery turned bloody...

559
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,676
- Had some shit got
into me over there, man.
- Crushed to death by...

560
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,758
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

561
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,872
Had a very shiny nose

562
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,877
- And if you ever saw it
- What you slowin' down for?

563
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,149
- Be cool. Be cool.
- What you doin'?

564
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,670
- Come on. Come on.
- What the fuck, man? Aw, shit!

565
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,349
- All of the other reindeer
- What the fuck we doin' over here?

566
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,948
- Say, man, check out all these kids.
- Man!

567
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,837
Hey, let's go to the liquor store
and go to the club.

568
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,599
Look, man, I'm gonna take care of you.
We're gonna go down to the club.

569
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,671
- We don't know them motherfuckers!
- That's the whole point, baby.

570
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,035
Come on. Get in the spirit.
Hey, y'all come on over here!

571
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,152
- Nigger, we gonna get robbed.
- Hey, be cool, nigger.
Y'all come on over here.

572
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,916
- Be cool, man. Damn.
- Rudolph, with your nose so bright

573
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,036
All of y'all gonna get some.
All right. All right.

574
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,951
- Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
- What, motherfu...

575
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,110
Yeah, man. Merry Christmas,
motherfucker. Go on. Leave me alone.

576
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,869
Say, say, Skippy. Hey, man,
why don't you bring your ass
over here and quit that jivin'.

577
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,833
Come on. Yeah, yeah. Y'all take
all the toys. All right. Get one.

578
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,428
- See what I'm sayin'?
I ain't kiddin'. We givin' it away.
- All right. All right. Yeah.

579
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,353
That's why Santa Claus don't wanna
come 'round here 'cause he's scared
he's gonna get shot or robbed.

580
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,235
All right. Just one. Hey, hey, hey.
Give me this, man. Get a... Get a...
Get a toy.

581
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,316
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Why you stealin'?
You ain't gotta steal.

582
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,635
- All right, all right, all right.
- Funky little brothers.
I talked to him.

583
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,359
He says he ain't never gonna come down
here unless he's got police protection.

584
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,113
Last year, one of y'all niggers
stole one of his reindeer.

585
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,279
No, no. I say let's just go up there
and kill that motherfucker.

586
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,316
Man, me and Anthony gave out
a couple of things, but that was it.

587
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,228
You gave toys and turkeys to people.
Then you got the hell outta Dodge.

588
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,558
Man. Y'all sayin' my man is
goin' around handin' out $100 bills...

589
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,949
and sayin' that
God Almighty gave it to him?

590
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,635
My cousin lives up there
in Mount Vernon. He says that Cleon's
up there actin' a goddam fool.

591
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,790
That ol' high-profile ass
nigger.

592
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,717
Bought a brand-new Caddy.

593
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,478
Folk know he can't afford it.

594
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,070
- Look, man, I'm gonna go
over there and talk to him.
- No, no, no. Fuck the talk!

595
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,958
I'm drivin' up there, and I'm gonna
take him out before he rats us out.

596
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,838
Look, Kirby.
I'm gonna handle everything, all right?

597
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,509
- I'm gonna straighten this shit out.
- All right.

598
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,030
But if you don't take care of this,
Anthony, I promise you, I will.

599
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,236
I told you we didn't
need another man.

600
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,118
That's y'all's motherfuckin'
punk-ass friend!

601
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,510
People runnin' from their worries

602
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,835
While the judge and his juries

603
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,596
They take the law
that's part of the flaw

604
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,554
No. Oh, shit, Cleon!

605
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,631
Love, fallin', fussin' and a-cussin'

606
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,233
Damn!

607
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,555
The feelin' now is killin'

608
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,270
For peace no one is willin'

609
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,591
Kinda make you get that feelin'

610
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,951
Everybody's startin'

611
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,710
Use the pill and the dope

612
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,670
Educated fools

613
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,235
From uneducated schools

614
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,715
Right now we'd like to bring on
a young man who believes in
doing things his own way.

615
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,991
And based on the way he kinda
get next to all of the folks
who've seen him work...

616
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,593
his way has gotta be
pretty hip.

617
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,434
So let's lay some noise
on the mighty Al Green.

618
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,197
Apartment 13!

619
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,311
I'm so tired of bein' alone

620
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,715
I'm so tied up on my own

621
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,075
Won't you help me, girl

622
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,438
Just as soon as you can

623
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,836
Don't move, mister!

624
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,350
I been wantin' to get
next to you, baby

625
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,311
You see, sometime
I fold my arms, I say

626
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,796
- Ooo-ooo
- Mmm-hmm-mmm

627
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,309
Whoa-oh-oh

628
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,908
Oh, baby, hey

629
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,989
Needing you has proven to be

630
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,470
To be my greatest dream
Yeah

631
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,870
- I'm so tired of being alone
- Oh, tired, baby

632
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,310
- Here's the rest of the fifties.
- Put it in there.

633
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,235
You know, I still feel fucked-up
about this whole situation.

634
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,279
Look, feelin' fucked-up
don't help a goddam thing
and it ain't gonna bring nobody back.

635
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,915
- Shit!
- So, just worry about yourself.
We just gotta get outta here.

636
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,198
- Come on.
- Say, man, you got everything?

637
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,197
Yeah, grab that bag.

638
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,755
This is a bitch.

639
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,111
This is it, man.
This is it.

640
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,117
All we got to do, boy,
is make it to Mexico.

641
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,674
We'll be fine.
We'll get us a villa, see?

642
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,360
And then, and buy a boat
and sail all around the gulf.

643
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,318
Everything will be fine.
We just gotta get the fuck outta here.

644
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,590
Yeah, maybe I can send
for Sarah once we get down there.

645
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,553
Well, anything's possible.
Come on.

646
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,069
Wait a minute.
Run, Anthony! Hyah!

647
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,470
Y'all get back!
Get away right there! Get off me!

648
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,435
Shit!

649
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,990
- You pity fool, you pity fool
- Fuck!

650
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,913
You better have some sympathy

651
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,750
Yeah
'Cause there's educated people

652
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,429
Runnin' the lives of our society

653
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,918
Makin' up the rules

654
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,239
Mr Curtis, you have been
lawfully tried in this court...

655
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,550
and found guilty on all charges.

656
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,269
Do you have anything to say on your own
behalf before I pronounce sentence?

657
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,992
Uh...

658
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,038
no, ain't nothin' I say
gonna get me out of this.

659
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,876
But things were gettin' bad
for me, and...

660
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,468
I had to do what I had to do
to s... to survive.

661
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,551
Maybe it was wrong, but l...

662
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,240
I certainly didn't mean
for anybody to be hurt.

663
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,754
Uh, Your Honour,
please consider before sentencing...

664
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,713
that my client served his country proud
in the Marine Corps.

665
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,070
As a matter of fact, he was
a member of an elite unit...

666
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,151
a sergeant,
decorated with many medals.

667
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,199
In fact, one of those medals
was the, uh, Silver Star, for valour.

668
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,919
I realize that my client had
a difficult time adjusting when he...

669
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,673
Excuse me, Counsel.
l, too, was a marine...

670
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,389
and I served my country proudly
in World War Il, a real war, I may add.

671
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,317
- Yes, Your Honor...
- I'm not finished yet, please.

672
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,671
I received the Purple Heart
at Guadalcanal.

673
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,189
Now, this young man has obviously
forgotten some very...

674
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,398
fundamental things like decency
and dedication and honor...

675
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,158
everything the corps taught us.

676
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,748
He is a disgrace to everyone
that has ever put on that uniform...

677
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,954
and I will not permit you or him to use
the Vietnam War as a cop-out here.

678
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,791
Anthony Curtis, for your
participation in this crime...

679
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,435
a crime that took the lives of several
innocent people, I do hereby...

680
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,637
sentence you to the custody of the
Attorney General of the United States...

681
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,075
for a period of 15 years to life.

682
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,760
Oh, my God.

683
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,753
These proceedings are concluded.
This court is adjourned.

684
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,037
"Life"? What the fuck
he mean "life"?

685
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,509
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

686
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,751
What the fuck he talkin' about, "life"?
Man, fuck you! Fuck you!

687
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,711
- Hey!
- Oh, Anthony!

688
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,876
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

689
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,712
You, remove the prisoner
from the court!

690
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,758
- You hear me?
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Restrain the prisoner!

691
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,077
Get him outta here! Let the record
show... Let the record show...

692
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,997
that a chair was thrown
at the judge.

693
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,437
Whoa, whoa

694
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,713
If you see me
walkin' down the street

695
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,593
And I start to cry

696
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,069
Each time we meet

697
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,437
Then walk on by

698
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,793
Walk on by

699
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,269
Make believe

700
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,875
That you don't see the tears

701
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,793
You just let me grieve
in private

702
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,031
'Cause each time I see you

703
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,716
I just can't help myself
I think about how tight we used to be

704
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,992
I break down and cry

705
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,036
Oh, baby

706
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,714
Walk on by

707
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,998
Hmm-mmm-mmm

708
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:59,071
I just can't get over
losing you

709
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,670
So if I seem

710
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,274
Broken in two

711
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,229
Please walk on by

712
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,234
Walk on by

713
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,994
Foolish pride

714
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,271
Is all that I have left

715
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,233
So let me hide

716
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,791
The tears and the sadness
you gave me

717
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,717
You put the hurt on me

718
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,637
You socked it to me, mama

719
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,436
When you said goodbye

720
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,270
So, please, walk on by

721
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,436
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

722
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,911
So do me a favour

723
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,396
And walk on by

724
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,911
So I'm beggin' you to

725
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,514
Walk on by

726
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,272
Oh, yeah

727
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,198
And make believe you never see
the tears I cry

728
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,076
So I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you

729
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,395
To walk on by

730
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,031
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

731
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,677
Oh

732
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,030
There's no dust in my eye

733
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,071
Oh, no

734
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,677
Smoke ain't makin' me cry

735
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,360
No, no, no

736
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,392
It's the hurt
you put on me, yeah

737
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,039
I don't want you
to see this man cry

738
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,190
Where is the love

739
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,669
Where is the love

740
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,109
Where is the love

741
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,555
Where is the love

742
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,074
Where is the love

743
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,355
Where is the love

744
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,630
Where is the love

745
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,990
Ooh, yeah, yeah

746
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,873
Where is the love

747
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,474
You said you'd give to me

748
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,989
Soon as you were free

749
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,198
Will it ever be

750
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:21,110
Where is the love

751
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,356
You told me that you
didn't love him

752
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,150
And you were gonna say goodbye

753
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,115
But if you really
didn't mean it

754
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,718
Why did you have to lie

755
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,598
Where is the love

756
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,319
You said was mine
all mine

757
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,874
Till the end of time

758
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,839
Was it just a lie

759
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:59,516
Where is the love

760
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,070
If you had had a sudden
change of heart

761
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,915
I wish that you
would tell me so

762
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,716
Don't leave me hangin'
on these promises

763
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,392
You've gotta let me know

764
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,948
Oh-ohh

765
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,508
Do-do do-do

766
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,875
Do-do do-do

767
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,511
Do-do do-do-do
