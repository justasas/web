Here comes Chestnut's
carrot cake!

3
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:12,463
I know we want this
to be special,

4
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:14,131
but Chestnut is a horse.

5
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:16,133
Any day he's not being made
into an Ikea meatball

6
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:19,470
is a birthday.

7
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:21,839
And remember, even though
it's his tenth birthday,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,342
we have to pretend he's six or
he'll be in a bad mood all week.

9
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:29,513
Surprise!

10
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:32,917

11
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:34,819
Max! He was supposed
to do that!

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,854
What?
I know what he wished for.

13
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:38,956
That one day,
he and I live in a world

14
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:40,424
where our love is recognized

15
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:42,993
and we have the same rights
as gay couples.

16
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:45,663
There you go, baby.

17
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:48,099
Hey, look,
his shoe just fell off.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,002
Or maybe he kicked it off 'cause
he's getting ready to par-tay.

19
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:54,038
What are we gonna do?

20
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,272
We don't have any money.

21
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:56,874
I wanted a massage last week,

22
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,375
so I just sat next
to someone on the bus

23
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:00,544
who looked like he'd touch me.

24

I may have an idea
how we can get 'em.

He now shares
an artisan barn

34

need four new shoes,

he got it from me

from the headlines,

the newspaper,

00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,677
And action!
Shooter comes in.

175
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:04,780
Bang! Bang!

176
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:06,615
Cut!

177
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:09,018
Excuse me,
how did you get through?

178
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,653
Oh, please.

179
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:12,054
I once got through
the Berlin Wall.

180
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:15,925
You think two kids
with walkie-talkies can stop me?

181
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:18,327
Damn, this room's got
a sweet spread.

182
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:20,863
Free Sushi? Uh-yes.

183
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,933
Free dessert? Uh-duh.

184
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,201
This is great.

185
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,936
We've gotta figure out a way
to get paid

186
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:29,739
to sit around, eat free food,
and do nothing more often.

187
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,609
Oh, I think you cracked
that code a long time ago.

188
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,144
Would it be tacky

189
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:37,046
if I packed some Sushi
in my purse for later?

190
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:39,582
Already packed mine,
already packed yours.

191
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,852
This is the VIP lounge.

192
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:46,889
See? The shrimp
have already been de-turded.

193
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,057
Oh, hi, girls.

194
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:52,128
You finally got new uniforms.
You look stupid.

195
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,730
These are actually
from the costume department

196
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,732
of a little show called
<i>Law & Order: SVU</i>

197
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,667
that Max and I
are costarring in.

198
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:03,038
Costars? Honey, please.
You two are just extras.

199
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,110
Um, extra paid
and full of purse Sushi.

200
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:10,412
- They're ready for you two.
- Oh! Be right there.

201
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,915
Just gonna put my purse
in the fridge.

202
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,384
Thomas. Tom. T-pain.
Can we chat?

203
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:16,685
What is it, dude?

204
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:19,188
Your crew got soy sauce
all over my computer.

205
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:22,024
And according to our agreement,
you must pay all the damages.

206
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,660
- How much do you want?
- $300.

207
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,462
It's a piece of crap.

208
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,964
But it was a gift
from my father.

209
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:31,100
And you know how important
family is in our culture.

210
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:34,436
Again, I don't.
I was raised by two white women.

211
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:36,071
Oh, hey, hey.

212
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:39,508
Yes, uh, who do I talk to
about becoming a star?

213
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:45,314
This is so exciting!

214
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,616
God! That woman keeps
pushing my head down.

215
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:50,686
I feel like I'm on a date
with her.

216
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,855
Okay, so you guys are here
behind the counter,

217
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,190
doing your waitress thing.

218
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:55,624
Shooter aims for the cook

219
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,027
but hits her,
our featured waitress.

220
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,329
Hey, didn't I already see you
on <i>SVU?</i>

221
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,864
Oh, yeah, I remember.

222
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:03,632
They found your head
in a mini fridge in the Hudson.

223
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,967
I knew I recognized you.

224
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,735
Wait, we've already
killed you?

225
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:08,604
Sorry, babe, you're out.

226
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,239
Aw.

227
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,241
Well, you gave great head.

228
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:14,710
Tom, we gotta bump someone up
to the featured waitress.

229
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:16,579
Pays 1,000 more bucks.

230
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,913
Max, that could be
the extra money

231
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:19,215
we need for Chestnut.

232
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:20,716
Could one of us do it?

233
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,084
Can either of you act like
you've been hit with a bullet?

234
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:23,953
Well, it just so happens

235
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:26,288
I have been hit
by a bullet twice--

236
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,557
once at a 7-Eleven
and once running away

237
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,992
in the parking lot
of a 7-Eleven.

238
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:32,027
So yeah, I think I got this.

239
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:33,996
I'm thinking maybe a blonde
would be better.

240
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:35,297
Caroline?

241
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:38,200
Well, I did have a pretty
convincing death scene

242
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:40,135
as Fantine,
and I died like--

243
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,872
well, should I just show you?

244
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:57,820
You are such a nerd.

245
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:00,689
That's great, Caroline.

246
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,891
Special effects,

247
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,259
put the blood device
on Caroline.

248
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,426
She's our special victim.

249
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:05,861
Really? I got it?

250
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,863
Yes, but a little less
"French Revolution,"

251
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:10,833
and a lot more
"Face down on the floor."

252
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:14,403
You can't take a shot.
You can't even do a shot.

253
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:17,039
Don't be mad, Max.
I'm doing this for Chestnut.

254
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,208
And it's not my fault
he liked my death scene.

255
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,278
He liked your death scene
with his penis.

256
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:25,714
Wow, Max, show business really
brings out the worst in you.

257
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,418
You haven't seen me
at a wedding.

258
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,320
Hello!
You just put your hand

259
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,922
down a woman's blouse
without asking?

260
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,990
Every day.

261
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:37,593
Well, here.
Can I help you?

262
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:41,163
No, it's a union thing.

263
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:42,965
Aren't you in there
a little long?

264
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,534
Yeah. Let me just--

265
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,371
Caroline, that special
effects rig you're wearing

266
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,539
is very sensitive,

267
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,707
so don't let anything
near your chest.

268
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,244
Except me.

269
00:10:56,645 --> 00:10:58,080
And don't be nervous.

270
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,082
The camera's gonna love you.
How could it not?

271
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,051
DJ, stop flirting with me.

272
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:05,622
I'm gonna die soon
and you'll never get over me.

273
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,458
Promise you'll die soon?

274
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,760
Max, I'm about to be shot,

275
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,729
and I can't die
with bad blood between us.

276
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,998
We're good.
You're living my dream, girl.

277
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:18,467
- Do me proud.
- I will.

278
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,703
No! Don't hug with it!

279
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,211
Caroline,
you set the thing off.

280
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:30,679
We weren't rolling.

281
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,283
Really? That's too bad,
because that was gold.

282
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:37,720
That's a wrap, everybody.
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

283
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,022
I'm so sorry.
It just went off.

284
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:42,524
Prettiest screw-up all day.

285
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:43,759
After you get cleaned up,

286
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,294
why don't we have dinner
at my hotel?

287
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:47,162
Dinner?
Yeah, I'd like that.

288
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:48,530
Let's say 8:00.

289
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,100
My assistant will give you
the address and my room number.

290
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,170
You know, this is exactly
how you look in all my dreams

291
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,839
where I shoot you.

292
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,241
The director just invited me
to dinner at his hotel,

293
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:00,776
but it's in his room.

294
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:01,977
- Do you think he--
- Yes.

295
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:03,078
- Is that why he--
- Yes.

296
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,246
- Will you come with?
- Yes.

297
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:05,414
Maybe you're wrong.

298
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:06,615
Maybe he thought my audition
was really--

299
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:07,783
No.

300
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:11,254
Caroline, next time,
maybe a little less.

301
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,619
Now, remember.

302
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,987
This director slips you anything
that looks like a sweet tart,

303
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:21,822
it's probably that date rape
drug that knocks you out

304
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:23,257
and distorts your memory.

305
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:25,325
Or at least that's what it does
to the guys I give it to.

306
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:29,029
It's never gonna get to that.
I have my own date rape drug.

307
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,847
I talk about myself
incessantly

308
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:33,350
till guys get bored
and pass out.

309
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:35,452
So if that doesn't work,
what are your limits?

310
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,053
A little over the sweater,
under sweater,

311
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:40,157
a little front door, back door,
a little secret staircase?

312
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:43,293
I don't know what that is,
but no one goes up my staircase,

313
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:44,828
not even for Chestnut.

314
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,930
At the most,
I'll do kissing.

315
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:49,466
You are thinking
like an extra.

316
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,334
You need to think
like a star

317
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,602
if you're gonna
buy Chestnut shoes,

318
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:55,172
then therapy, then a way
out of scientology.

319
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:59,342
Oh, hi.
You brought company.

320
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:02,179
Yes, she's my ride.
We share a subway card.

321
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,480
Well, she uses the card.

322
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,482
I jump the turnstile
and she pretends to chase me,

323
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:07,751
yelling "Don't worry,
I'll get her!"

324
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,219
Well, come on in.

325
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,687
Stay for a glass
of champagne, Max.

326
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:12,622
Oh, and don't worry about
taking the subway home alone.

327
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:14,057
My driver can take you.

328
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,392
Now I'm torn.

329
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:16,760
Because as much
as I don't want you

330
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,094
to have sex
against your will,

331
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:21,031
I do wanna roll up
to the McDonald's in a limo.

332
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:22,432
There's no rush.

333
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,733
Come on, let's sit down
and hang out.

334
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,769
It was really nice of you
to invite me up here

335
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,205
to have a casual,
work-related dinner.

336
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:32,876
Max there, Caroline there,
and me, well, here.

337
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,245
Can't turn it off,
still directing.

338
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:39,916
Oh! You know,
I love this hotel.

339
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,985
I came here once
to do a photo shoot

340
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,453
for a "20 under 20:

341
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,088
Teen millionaires
to watch" spread,

342
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,358
and I remember I had
just gotten my haircut,

343
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,626
which was a big decision,

344
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,461
'cause I was kinda known
for my long hair.

345
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,129
And he wanted
to take an inch off,

346
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,397
which doesn't sound
like a big deal,

347
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,468
but when you're known
for your long hair...

348
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:02,372
People are expecting
to see you with long hair.

349
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:04,307
So was that okay?

350
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:06,810
Oh!
Yeah, sure.

351
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,111
It--it's just Max is here,

352
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:09,312
and I don't want her
to feel left out.

353
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:12,015
Sorry.
Got it.

354
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:17,120
That was nice.

355
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,089
You're a good kisser.
[Clears throat]

356
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,058
Are you eating
a cinnamon altoid?

357
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,528
I'm eating
a cinnamon altoid.

358
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:31,268
Well,
then I just tasted you.

359
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,470
Look, DJ, I think
you have the wrong idea.

360
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,971
[Phone ringing]

361
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:36,706
Oh!
Hold that thought.

362
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:39,142
I would never interrupt this
for a work call,

363
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:42,579
but it's my wife and I wanna
say "good night" to the kids.

364
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,514
That guy's a player.

365
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,182
I'm not talking my way
out of this one.

366
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:47,717
We're screwed.

367
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:49,452
Yeah!
He's got a high tolerance.

368
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:52,822
Your long-hair speech
almost roofied me.

369
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:55,258
What do we do, Max?
I don't want to offend him.

370
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,527
We need that extra money
for Chestnut.

371
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:59,496
This is the oldest tale
in the book--

372
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:02,198
a woman forced to trade her body
to get her child shoes.

373
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:03,934
It's Shakespearian,
it's Dickensian,

374
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,769
it's Kardashian.

375
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,537
Look at the bright side.

376
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,306
You already thought
he was sexy,

377
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,074
so you were probably
gonna sleep with him eventually.

378
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,509
And now that he's married,

379
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,077
you know he won't cheat on you
with somebody else

380
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:15,879
because you're
that somebody else.

381
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,881
You a side bitch!

382
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:20,850
No, Max, I can
just tell him how I feel.

383
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,085
Besides, he probably
already got it.

384
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:24,220
You heard me tell him
he read the signs wrong.

385
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,591
[Sighs]

386
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:32,529
Apparently the sign he read
said "Three-way up ahead."

387
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,863
Pretty good, right?

388
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:35,398
Hit show, wife, kids.

389
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,500
Still find time
to get to the gym.

390
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,903
So you guys need to drink
a little more before we do this?

391
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,005
'Cause I don't.

392
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,373
All right,
I'm just gonna say this

393
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:44,941
before that towel
comes off.

394
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,277
I think you've misread
the signals here.

395
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,379
Really!
That sucks.

396
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,681
I'm sorry.
These things happen.

397
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,416
It reminds me of that time
I had tea

398
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,152
with that prince in Dubai
and he thought he bought me.

399
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,488
Turns out he bought
a different blonde.

400
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,757
[Laughs]
Oh, men!

401
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:09,766
- Good morning, DJ.
- Morning!

402
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,035
See, Max?
No hard feelings.

403
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:14,337
I told you
it was gonna work out.

404
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:17,741
Hi! I'm ready
for my fake blood pouch.

405
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,079
Um, I think you got
the wrong breasts.

406
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,348
But for a rough guy,
you got a soft touch.

407
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:26,549
Yup.

408
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,118
There's been a change.

409
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,520
Uh, Max is now getting featured,
and you're in the B.G.--

410
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,155
Background.

411
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:34,457
- These are real?
- Yep.

412
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,060
Nice job.

413
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,696
You hear that, Max?
Now I'm in the B.G.

414
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:42,198
I didn't do DJ,
so I'm in the B.G.

415
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,833
Max!

416
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:46,236
We have time for
one full take before lunch,

417
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:48,571
then we'll come back and do
the rest of your coverage after.

418
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,373
Hey, maybe you and I could
have a little lunch together

419
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:51,641
in my trailer.

420
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:53,743
Well,
I do love a trailer.

421
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:55,545
Okay, let's stay
on schedule, people.

422
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,380
My kid's reading a poem
at school.

423
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,682
By the way,
your rack looks fantastic.

424
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:03,353
You seem like
a great dad.

425
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:05,422
DJ, is this
about last night,

426
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:06,656
'cause I wouldn't
wear a towel?

427
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,691
No.
No, we're good.

428
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,460
I don't wanna see that.
Bury her deep.

429
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,795
"Bury her deep"?

430
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:13,530
Did he just say,
"Bury her deep"?

431
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,665
Caroline, you need
to work back there.

432
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,534
Is this how Hollywood
treats women?

433
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:19,436
This is how Hollywood
treats everyone.

434
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:20,837
Everybody ready.

435
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,274
Max, if you do this,
you'll be getting paid for sex.

436
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:26,876
Well, it's about time.

437
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,378
Places, everyone.

438
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:31,781
You don't have to do this.
Chestnut is my horse.

439
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:34,050
And action!
Max, you're wiping the counter.

440
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:36,319
The killer comes in.
You look up.

441
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,654
[Under breath]
Don't do it.

442
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,055
We can find money
somewhere else.

443
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,224
Cut!
Tom, I don't wanna see her.

444
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:43,059
- Caroline.
- Here they come.

445
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,428
Come on, everybody.
Back to one.

446
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:48,264
And action!
Max, you're wiping the counter.

447
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:50,867
The killer comes in.
You look up.

448
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:53,236
Pick up!

449
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,271
[Bell dings]

450
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,474
Max, seriously,
it's not worth it.

451
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,242
Cut!
Get her out of there.

452
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:01,544
Reset, reset.
Sorry about all that, people.

453
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:02,879
Now, let's give me
the bullet

454
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,582
I've been waiting for
my whole life.

455
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,618
I haven't felt
this unwanted

456
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,854
since I tried to teach
those inner-city school kids

457
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:11,988
how to knit.

458
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:13,490
Seriously Caroline,
you have to stay here,

459
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:14,724
away from the shot,

460
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:15,892
or neither of you
is gonna be paid.

461
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,461
Hey, Tom, you know
what this scene needs?

462
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:21,631
A little more cashier.

463
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:25,401
Oy, that crew is doing
a lot of damage to this diner.

464
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:29,305
Well, I'm doing some damage
to this fancy French water.

465
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:33,009
150 for the floor,
20 for the napkins they used,

466
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,248
and...

467
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:42,485
And 55 bucks for that
gorgeous picture of the city.

468
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:44,621
This is ridiculous.

469
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:47,390
How much longer do I have
to wait to be discovered?

470
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,425
Do what every other
American would do--

471
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:52,395
skip the hard work
and put out a sex tape.

472
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,632
No, I'm gonna go out there.
Where's my lipstick?

473
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,902
Here, hold my Shake Weight.

474
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:01,371
And my Fresca.

475
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,474
Oh, hi.

476
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:07,544
Who do I talk to about
getting a part in this thing?

477
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:10,013
I mean, I already let the guy
who puts out the cookies

478
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,182
touch my boobs.

479
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,716
We don't have a guy
who puts out cookies.

480
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,451
Yo.

481
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,321
Okay, everybody ready!
Camera up!

482
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,323
Oh, he looks important.

483
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:21,691
- Oh, no, no! Stop, stop!
- No! Let go!

484
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:23,159
- Ooh!
- Not the blood switch!

485
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,895
[Bang]

486
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:28,531
Ahhh!

487
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:32,068
Someone shot Max!

488
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:35,071
Cut!
Tom, get rid of Max too.

489
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:36,773
Get me another girl.

490
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,341
Typical!

491
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:41,911
Shoot on my chest
and you're done with me.

492
00:19:43,847 --> 00:19:48,318
Hi, you looking
for a new girl?

493
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,121
Last time I looked
like this,

494
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,389
I was coming out
of an acid trip

495
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,759
and my friend Daniel
was missing.

496
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,127
I gotta admit,

497
00:19:58,128 --> 00:20:00,797
getting shot felt
kinda gangsta waitress.

498
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:03,766
I'm like Notorious BLT.

499
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:05,735
So here's the deal.

500
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:06,936
We'll pay you
for the day yesterday,

501
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:09,572
but not for today
or for the featured extra.

502
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:12,275
- Say what?
- Not so fast, my brother.

503
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,144
Here is the latest tally
for my diner damage.

504
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,447
What's this last
$1,000 charge?

505
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:19,983
That is for the damage
done to Max and Caroline.

506
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,684
According
to crew scuttlebutt,

507
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:24,254
the director tried
some funny business last night.

508
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:25,521
This is not cool, dude.

509
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:28,224
It is most decidedly
not cool, pal.

510
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:31,060
So maybe there is someone
in a union I can talk to

511
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,929
about this particular
damage.

512
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,231
Not to mention the child
labor laws you violated

513
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,600
by working with Han.

514
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,136
Don't talk to anyone.
I'll get 'em paid.

515
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:41,838
This sucks.

516
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,573
I knew we should've
shot at a Denny's.

517
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,377
Han, that is the sweetest,

you just did for us.

00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:51,914
It is, and Caroline is totally
gonna put out for you tonight.

That's kind of her thing now.

521
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,886
Well, I don't want anyone
to take advantage of you two.

522
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:58,454
You're my girls.
