1
00:00:03,425 --> 00:00:04,894
Pick up... chicken breasts.

2
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:08,031
The way I know you want it,
with the bone in.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,950
We really should
hold a seminar

4
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:12,935
about sexual harassment
in the workplace.

5
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:15,155
Why? He's already
so good at it.

6
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:16,372
I'm serious.
How'd he like it

7
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:18,124
if we did that to him
every time we ordered?

8
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:19,775
Well,
let's find out.

9
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:21,044
Ordering.

10
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:22,945
One pastrami.

11
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:24,497
Can you do me a favor,
doll-face?

12
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:27,116
Make it so big and thick, you
can't get your mouth around it.

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:29,335
Can you do that
for me?

14
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:32,055
Yes,
and two matzo ball soups,

15
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,223
hold the balls.

16
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:34,974
Wait,
I'll hold the balls,

17
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:37,010
you just sit there
and look pretty.

18
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:40,480
And a cream of...

19
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:43,566
nope, can't.
Just grossed myself out.

20
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:46,336
When is it
going to get dirty?

21
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,017
Max, come out.

22
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,936
If I came out,
it would not be for you,

23
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,772
<i>it's be for that
hot dragon tattoo girl.</i>

24
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:09,324
Welcome, board members,
to the very first

25
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:12,194
financial assessment meeting
of Max's homemade cupcakes.

26
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:15,230
I was told
there would be a cheese plate.

27
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:16,748
After five months
in business,

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,501
we're showing a profit
of $725.

29
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:21,403
I have to say,
I'm a little disappointed.

30
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:23,956
Really? 'Cause, dude,
we have so far exceeded

31
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,757
where I thought we'd be
in five months.

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,909
Look, we have to find a way
to make more money on the side

33
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:29,211
to put into the business.

34
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,380
Or we could quit now,
while we're a success.

35
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,747
What are you
talking about?

36
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:34,216
It's only
gonna get worse.

37
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,186
Or it could get better.
Why would you even say that?

38
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:39,888
Because it's life, and life
gets worse, that's what it does.

39
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,474
On life's resume,
under special skills it says,

40
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:44,560
"good at
making things worse."

41
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,728
- Do you always go to
the worst-case scenario?

42
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:53,068
Do you think you could try
to be more optimistic,

43
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,736
and not expect the worst
all the time?

44
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:58,240
Who's that?
More optimistic, right?

45
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:01,710
On the other side of that door
is all the money you lost,

46
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:03,445
and then we move back
into your townhouse,

47
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:06,632
and I masturbate in your tub
for a change.

48
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:14,173
It was twice,
and you could have knocked.

49
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:17,409
Who is it?

50
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:19,294
Detective James, NYPD.

51
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:21,096
Wait, don't open it!
Don't open it!

52
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:23,765
Oh, smoked it tuesday.
Open.

53
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:27,186
Sorry to bother you, miss.
Do you live in this apartment?

54
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,687
I'm gonna tell you right now,
officer,

55
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,988
our names
aren't on the lease.

56
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,356
We're an illegal sublet
with no place else to go.

57
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,408
Please, mercy.

58
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,978
Sorry, officer,
it's her first raid.

59
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,997
Relax, the landlord
didn't send me.

60
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,415
What do you know about

61
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:42,150
the tenant who lives in the
apartment directly above you?

62
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:43,502
His name is Lou.

63
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:44,786
Leo?

64
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:45,954
Saul?

65
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,206
Am I even close?

66
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,007
His name's
Nirham Chaduri.

67
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,510
Oh, man, I wasn't even
on the right continent.

68
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,348
Is that Nirham Chaduri?

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,135
Been dead for two weeks.
Lived alone, nobody knew.

70
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:01,386
Cats eat his face?

71
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:04,056
Max, could you please
not be so dark?

72
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,474
Kittens eat his face?

73
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:10,779
What? I'm just trying to put
a more positive spin on things.

74
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:18,987
Where are you going
with that?

75
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,240
That's my good China
with huckleberry hound on it.

76
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,024
I'm making
a "hello" cupcake plate

77
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:24,293
for our neighbors
across the hall.

78
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,544
Oh, no, you're not.

79
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:27,579
It's weird
not to know your neighbors.

80
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,964
No, it's weird
not to know your father,

81
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:32,718
but by the time you're four,
you get over it and move on.

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,386
This is a mistake.

83
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:36,138
Who knows what's lurking
behind that door?

84
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,340
Yes, something awful,
like nice people,

85
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:40,208
who might look out for us,
or say, "hello," in the hallway

86
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,209
when they see you.

87
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,594
No matter what
comes out of there,

88
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:45,380
I will not be "hello-ing" it up
in the hallway.

89
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:52,187
You got lucky.
Get back in here.

90
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,772
Who is it, please?

91
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:57,159
- Caroline,
your next-door neighbor.

92
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:00,696
Hi.

93
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,064
Uh, is this a bad time?

94
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,365
Not at all.

95
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,900
One sec.
Hi.

96
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:08,503
I just wanted to introduce
myself and my roommate, Max.

97
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:11,039
There, and give you
these cupcakes.

98
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,008
That is so nice.

99
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,244
Well, it's the leash...
least... least I can do.

100
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,681
Well, I gotta go.

101
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,640
Well, if we ever get a dog,
we know who can walk it.

102
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:34,763
- Listen.
- I know.

103
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:35,930
It's only been
a few days,

104
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:37,566
and somebody's already moved in
upstairs.

105
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,818
And they are
playing music!

106
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,373
Music is coming
through the floor into my ears.

107
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,490
I blame you for this.

108
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:46,941
When you knocked on that door
across the hall,

109
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,960
you might have
opened a portal to hell.

110
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:51,279
There, you hear
the devil music?

111
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,748
I think
it's the bee gees.

112
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,282
Exactly.

113
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,002
And walking!

114
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,971
Walking and music,
we have to stop this right now.

115
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:03,725
It's 10:00, people are allowed
to walk and play music.

116
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,260
Your lack
of apartment knowledge

117
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,262
is really starting
to piss me off.

118
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,765
We have to show him right now
not to screw us.

119
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,016
I need paper.

120
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,468
- What are you doing?
I mean, besides over-reacting?

121
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,936
Writing
a threatening note.

122
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,738
If we don't shut this down now,
next thing you know,

123
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,473
someone's having
an academy awards party

124
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:19,491
in your living room.

125
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,826
Is that what you want?

126
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:23,745
Strangers passing out
mini Oscar statues

127
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:27,315
that say, "best nachos?"

128
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,787
"I have
an unregistered gun

129
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,756
and can shoot you
through the floor"?

130
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:36,208
You're coming in
really hot, Max.

131
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,492
We're not giving him this.

132
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:39,494
It'll start a bad dynamic
between us.

133
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:43,498
God, how I miss
the quiet, dead indian guy.

134
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,167
Okay, we're gonna
hit and run.

135
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:51,506
Oh, you mean
"run," literally.

136
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:59,364
Shh, listen.

137
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:02,517
Reading the note,

138
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,569
freaking out...

139
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,523
Music off,
problem solved.

140
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:12,878
Respect!
Never doubt, never doubt.

141
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:16,131
Crossing the floor
to the door,

142
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,334
Closing the door,

143
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:23,472
Coming down the stairs,

144
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:26,641
What do we do?

145
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:27,592
Move?

146
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:35,713
What's he look like?

147
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:37,181
He's got his finger
over the peephole.

148
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,817
Okay, game on. Back up!

149
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,803
This is my building,
I've got to take it back.

150
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:44,806
<i>- Max, this is life, not
call of duty: Modern warfare 3.</i>

151
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:46,975
Move.

152
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:55,617
What is meaning
of this horrible, horrible note?

153
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:59,520
Oh, you're not a man?

154
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,956
What kind of question
is this?

155
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,691
Do I look like a man?

156
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,910
No, but you clump around
up there like a man.

157
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:07,078
Max, please.

158
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,881
Did you write
this horrible, horrible note?

159
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:12,033
I did.

160
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:14,335
First day
in my new home

161
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:18,756
and I'm given this horrible,
horrible note, with threats.

162
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:21,092
Well, they're not
actually threats.

163
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:24,479
"I will gut you
like a hog."

164
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:26,931
To be clear,
I only skimmed the note.

165
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:29,216
Everything was happening
so fast.

166
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:31,686
Listen, we've obviously
gotten off to a bad start.

167
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:33,037
Please come in.

168
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,057
Why would I want to come in
with you horrible, horrible...

169
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,894
ooh, cupcake land.
Ooh.

170
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:41,913
Yes, we have
a cupcake business.

171
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:43,364
We're just starting,
but doing well.

172
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:45,366
Max is the baker.
Say hello, Max.

173
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,285
I know people
in the mob.

174
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:49,737
That's Max, and I'm Caroline.
You are?

175
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,756
Sophie Kuchenski.

176
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:54,208
Is that a polish accent
I'm detecting?

177
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,209
Yes.

178
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:57,095
I visited Warsaw once,
I love it.

179
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:00,548
Oh, 'cause I hate it.
Rats and pimps.

180
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,618
Why have you
not yet offered me cupcake?

181
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,971
It's the least thing you can do,
after horrible, horrible note.

182
00:08:06,973 --> 00:08:08,640
Oh, sure.
Chocolate or vanilla?

183
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:11,109
Yes.

184
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:16,948
Why such sourpuss?

185
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,983
Sorry about that.
It's just, we work long hours

186
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,869
at the neighborhood diner,
and Max has another job as well,

187
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:24,105
and then she comes home and
she has to make the cupcakes.

188
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:27,608
Mmm.
So good.

189
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,876
Mmm.

190
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,612
How could someone so angry
make something so sweet?

191
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:32,997
She's not always
like this.

192
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,584
I'm usually like this,
just ask the previous tenant.

193
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:40,621
Oh, wait.
You can't.

194
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:43,958
You know, you two girls
are like these cupcakes.

195
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,179
One is dark and heavy
and one is light and fluffy.

196
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,732
I prefer the fluffy one.

197
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,984
Well, I think we've
made our point.

198
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:55,153
No music, no clumping,
I'll shoot you

199
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:57,271
through the floor,
thanks for stopping by.

200
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,359
I'm so glad we can
joke with each other already.

201
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,995
Sorry about the note,
can we start ov...

202
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:05,980
you have
the chanel allure lip gloss?

203
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:07,281
Yeah.

204
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:10,368
Mm, you know the chanel?

205
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,838
Know? Love.
I can't afford it any more.

206
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,375
Oh, take one.
I got handfuls in my bag.

207
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:19,177
Really?

208
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:21,829
Oh, that's so nice.

209
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:25,433
Both: Ahh.

210
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:26,434
Hey.

211
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,603
Hey! Hey!

212
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:30,671
Do I have to put you
on a leash?

213
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,857
Hey, we start again.

214
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:37,511
You take a chanel,
and I take more cupcakes to go.

215
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:39,947
Oh, sure.

216
00:09:48,957 --> 00:09:50,792
Yes.

217
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:03,154
I knew it.
Bitch played us for cupcakes.

218
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:05,423
It's 3:00 A.M.
Why are you dressed?

219
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:08,226
Never took off my clothes,
'cause soldiers don't.

220
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,394
We have to be ready
when the enemy attacks.

221
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:13,380
Okay, you were right,
I was wrong.

222
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:14,882
Why do you have the broom?

223
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:16,651
'Cause I ran out
of finger bullets.

224
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:18,770
Wait, you're gonna fall.

225
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:20,071
I can't believe
we have a broom.

226
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,406
<i>All this time I've been sweeping
with an us weekly.</i>

227
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:25,359
I knew this would happen,
but I didn't say anything,

228
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,578
'cause you were all, "Max is
the worst-case scenario."

229
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,497
Well, we showed weakness
and now, look.

230
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:32,033
And by "we,"
I mean "you."

231
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:35,569
Deal with this,
cupcake thief!

232
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:38,339
Yeah, one more time,
and hard.

233
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:44,128
Okay, now she broke our house.
We're in a war.

234
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,380
She wants a piece of me,
she's gonna get it.

235
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:51,519
Where are my heels?

236
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:52,770
I mean,
who did she think I am?

237
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:55,556
Someone she can just buy off
with a tube of chanel?

238
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:56,891
Well, your legs
did kind of snap back

239
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:59,360
over your head pretty quick
when she offered it.

240
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:14,492
I thought you were
man with pizza.

241
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,919
You have a porch swing
in there.

242
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:28,339
You have
an electric cigarette.

243
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:30,958
What is it
you two girls want?

244
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,428
Uh, I forgot.

245
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,432
Just so thrown by the swing
and the everything.

246
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:40,685
Oh, you're taking advantage
of us

247
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,803
by still playing that music
after we talked.

248
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:47,692
You two are harshing
my marshmallow.

249
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:50,411
So I'm gonna have to call
my friend the landlord tomorrow

250
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:52,813
and tell him about
the horrible, horrible note.

251
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:54,481
Mmm.

252
00:11:57,537 --> 00:12:00,922
Oh, my God,
she's a hooker.

253
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:04,342
I've been using
a hooker's lip gloss.

254
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:05,492
She's not a hooker.

255
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:06,544
Oh, good.

256
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:09,347
She's too old,
she's a madame.

257
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:11,999
You've been using
an old hooker's lip gloss.

258
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:18,338
Max, look, my lip.

259
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,573
Is this something?
I feel like I'm getting one.

260
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:23,176
For the last time,
you cannot get a herpes breakout

261
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:24,744
in under ten hours.

262
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:27,681
- You're right, now I'm jumping
to the worst-case scenario.

263
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:30,017
Maybe her lip gloss
wasn't a herpes breeding ground.

264
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,419
Maybe she's not a prostitute.
Maybe those young girls

265
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,855
weren't being held there
against their will.

266
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:37,107
Yeah, maybe she just
has sleepovers

267
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,142
with women on swings
in the their nighties.

268
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:42,612
You know,
like people do.

269
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,316
Welcome
to Williamsburg diner.

270
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:47,951
How many in your party?

271
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:49,769
What kind of question
is this?

272
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:52,989
One,
I am my own party.

273
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,624
I take booth.

274
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:59,246
Now, now, who is that
over there?

275
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:00,881
Our new
upstairs neighbor.

276
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:02,999
Earl, does she look
like a prostitute to you?

277
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:06,086
Well, I don't like to
judge a book by its cover,

278
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:07,754
but if she was a book,

279
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:11,041
she'd be the kind
that other books pay for sex.

280
00:13:13,428 --> 00:13:16,063
Sophie just came in,
Earl thinks she's a hooker,

281
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:19,566
and now my lip is feeling
very courtney love.

282
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:21,435
I invited her here
for a free meal,

283
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:23,019
we have to make this work out
for us.

284
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:25,739
Last night, she threatened to
call her "friend," the landlord,

285
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:26,973
and that can
never happen.

286
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,325
We're illegal tenants,

287
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:30,810
and I'd rather have a noisy roof
over my head than no roof.

288
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:33,947
Let me do the talking.

289
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,665
You're too upset, and you might
say something insulting.

290
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,751
Like what?
"Hi, thanks for the lip gloss

291
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:39,503
"and the series of
uncomfortable conversations

292
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:41,838
with every lover I'll have
for the rest of my life."

293
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,923
You don't need
to tell them,

294
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:46,126
they'll figure it out
eventually.

295
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:48,328
Hi, thanks for coming in.

296
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,214
I like the uniforms.

297
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,333
You fill out
the front nicely,

298
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:56,436
and you with no boobs,
short-short skirts.

299
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:58,855
Smart girls.

300
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:01,224
Uh, we just wanted to
offer you a free dinner,

301
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,609
as our way of
apologizing.

302
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:04,027
So are you ready
to order?

303
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:06,480
What kind of question
is this?

304
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:10,984
Did you see
this horrible, horrible menu?

305
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:13,787
We can't have
nice conversation here.

306
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:17,190
Tomorrow I take you
to nice place, my treat.

307
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,909
Oh, you don't have
to do that.

308
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,795
No, no, I, too,
want to apologize.

309
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,880
You know, after you two left
the other night,

310
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:28,201
some of my girls said
that I was harsh on you.

311
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:31,171
Yes, all those girls
work for me.

312
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:32,923
Excuse me, I have to go
to the ladies' room right now

313
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:36,209
and look at my lips.

314
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,597
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

315
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,265
Are you enjoying
that beluga?

316
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:45,885
Mmm, so much. Thank you.

317
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:49,055
I haven't had caviar
in forever. Mmm.

318
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:52,559
Legs over your head much?

319
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:56,396
So, sourpuss,
you don't like caviar?

320
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,731
No, I'm more of
a cheeseburger kind of girl.

321
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,167
- Oh.
- This place is busy.

322
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:01,901
The waiters must
make a fortune.

323
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:04,704
Oh, yeah,
300, 350 a night.

324
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,506
What do you girls make?

325
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:08,925
60 to 80
on a good night.

326
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:11,344
And how do you expect you will
accomplish cupcake business

327
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:12,846
on money like this?

328
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,548
Well,
we're just starting out.

329
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,934
Yes, but at this rate,
it will take forever.

330
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:20,753
You know, I, too,
have big dream.

331
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:24,591
I am building summer house
by lake in Poland.

332
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:26,026
You want to see?

333
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,310
Oh, you have pictures?

334
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:30,480
No, I have house.

335
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:36,436
This is model
from the architect.

336
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:44,077
And I take it everywhere I am,
to remember where I'm going.

337
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,328
It's cool.

338
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,781
See, girls like you
should be making more money.

339
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:51,301
Maybe you could consider
coming to work for me.

340
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,921
- Sophie!
- Oh.

341
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:57,624
Thank you for sending girl
to my apartment yesterday.

342
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,893
Oh, did she do the job?

343
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:01,678
Oh, like no one
ever before.

344
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,465
Down on all fours,
under, over,

345
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:09,486
under again.
Oh!

346
00:16:09,488 --> 00:16:12,272
Well, my girls don't leave
until you're satisfied.

347
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:14,474
Maybe she can come
two times a week.

348
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:18,778
She can come
whenever you want her to come.

349
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,447
Are these
two of your girls?

350
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:23,500
Well, we were just
discussing that.

351
00:16:23,502 --> 00:16:27,504
Well, this one here looks like
she can take a lot.

352
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:30,173
Uh, thanks?

353
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:33,126
My friend Yanni
is at the bar.

354
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:35,662
Since his divorce, he's
in great need of your service.

355
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:37,764
<i>Prosze.
Oh, yes.</i>

356
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:42,636
Uh, excuse me, and, um,
don't touch my house.

357
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:46,473
I can't believe
she would actually consider

358
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:48,391
asking us
to be prostitutes.

359
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,643
I know.

360
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:51,444
I mean, me, I get,
but you, I don't see it.

361
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:55,231
You heard the guy, I look like
I could "take a lot."

362
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:58,017
Max, it's not funny.

363
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,203
Isn't it bad enough I may have herpes

364
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:01,521
from her chanel gloss?

365
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,573
Of course we're not
gonna do it, but come on,

366
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:04,991
you'd be
a terrible hooker.

367
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:08,328
Thank you,
I would be a terrible hooker.

368
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,863
I have a heart, and soul,
and dreams,

369
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,549
and want to fall in love
and have a family.

370
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:15,235
Oh, just say it,
you're bad in bed.

371
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:17,170
Let's get out of here.

372
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:19,222
I mean, really,
who does she think I am?

373
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:22,976
Someone who would just
sell myself to have nice things?

374
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:26,179
Let me just suck down a little
more of this, and we're off.

375
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,681
If we
walk out of here now,

376
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,733
we can just keep walking
to the homeless shelter.

377
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:33,236
Well, I'd rather be homeless
than a hooker.

378
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:34,771
Here she comes.
Sit down!

379
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:37,107
Let's thank her
and politely decline.

380
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:40,577
Okay, back to
what we were discussing.

381
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,245
Uh, thanks.

382
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:45,198
We appreciate the offer,
but we are going to pass.

383
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,400
So you don't want to
accomplish your dream?

384
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:50,587
Well, uh, I'm not exactly sure
those two things line up,

385
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,071
but thanks.

386
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:54,374
I thought you were smart girls.

387
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,092
We are smart girls,

388
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:57,844
and smart girls
don't have to sell their bodies

389
00:17:57,846 --> 00:17:59,245
to accomplish their goals.

390
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,631
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

391
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:03,850
It works for you, but us?

392
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:08,388
Well, she's bad in bed
and I have a sour puss.

393
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,877
What guy wants to pay for that?

394
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:18,548
You think
I am prostitute?

395
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,036
No, everyone has swings
with girls in pajamas.

396
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,791
My business card.

397
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,613
Home cleaning service.

398
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,749
She runs
a cleaning company.

399
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:39,469
"Sophie's choice."

400
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,421
You realize
what this means?

401
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:43,256
- We insulted
a hard-working woman

402
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:45,625
who was trying to help us
attain our goal?

403
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:46,676
Yes.

404
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:49,028
And I don't have herpes!

405
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,232
I should have
listened to you.

406
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:54,184
Meeting neighbors
is a big mistake.

407
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:56,269
And meeting neighbors
and calling them a prostitute?

408
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,637
Bigger mistake.

409
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,773
Plus, we have to kick in
60 for the check.

410
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,991
What can we
possibly say to her?

411
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:04,911
That we're sorry, and please
keep playing the bee gees

412
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,979
day or night
as loud as she wants.

413
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,817
Not a good idea
to be smiling right now.

414
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:14,254
I'm just so happy
I don't have herpes.

415
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,843
Hi, is this
a bad time?

416
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:23,463
Yes. Yes, I'm in the middle of
having sex for money

417
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:26,900
with every man
in Brooklyn.

418
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:30,503
What do you horrible,
horrible girls want?

419
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:33,056
Here, you left
part of your dream on the table.

420
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:34,441
And we want
to apologize.

421
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:37,393
I'm new at this whole
being neighborly thing.

422
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:40,146
What does the fluffy one
have to say?

423
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,898
Thank you for being
so generous,

424
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,616
and for offering to help us
make more money

425
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:45,151
to accomplish our dream.

426
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:47,987
And this is supposed
to make me feel better?

427
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:50,907
You called me prostitute.

428
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,542
Actually,
it's kind of a compliment

429
00:19:52,544 --> 00:19:53,827
that we thought
you were stunning enough

430
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,380
that men would pay
to have sex with you.

431
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:59,031
This is true.

432
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,950
