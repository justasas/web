Oh, come on, stop it,

Oh. Oh.

185
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:49,405
It happened.

186
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:51,841
I split my spanx.

Martha Stewart, please.

It's Michelle Obama.

00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:12,100
My sheets shrunk

Hello?

with a busted muffin tin,

194
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:21,709
or Alicia keys
with a wonky shower curtain.

195
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,611
And it really didn't work
when you were

This morning you used toilet
paper as a coffee filter...

And then used it
as toilet paper.

sounds silly to you,

234

is something about

every day

she liked them,

on her show.

won't help me,

I'ma bust her kneecaps
with a rolling pin

and then say,
"Now <i>that's</i> a good thing."

Okay, what if we just
send Martha an email,

00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,378
so we're not just
standing in her office,

305
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,579
begging some receptionist?

306
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,481

- Yes, it will.

trade show

you might be
interested in.

313
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:53,027
The only restaurant trade
I'm interested in

314
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,364
is if we can exchange you
for anybody else.

315
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,699
You won't be laughing
in a minute.

316
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,201

Soon, everyone will be able
to just push a button,

00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:10,078
day or night,
and get the cupcake.

321
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,447
So, I guess
what I'm saying is,

322
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,382
you might be screwed.

I thought
you were kidding,

00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,562
but the machines
are taking over.

328
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:28,796
We can't compete with that.

329
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,631
The business is done.
Game over.

gonna make it in the future.

This is where
the humans fight.

332
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,121
This is where we march down
to Martha Stewart

333
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,456
and demand a damn blurb,

334
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,191
so we can compete
with the machines...

335
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:44,128
Just like in "Terminator 2:
Rise of the desserts."

336

We can no longer
just wait for magic to happen.

Uh, thank you,
by the way,

341
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,171
for never telling me
that our former plan was magic.

342
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,944
We'll just reintroduce
ourselves and our cupcakes

343
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,846
to Martha and impress her
all over again,

344
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,514
even though I'm wearing
a necklace that I hate.

345
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,516

and lackluster.

Hi, excuse me.
Two questions.

351
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,528
Which floor
is Martha Stewart on?

352
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,531
And should I lose
this necklace?

353
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,100

speaks volumes.

359
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,810
Just got a little damp.

360
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,180
Thanks for your help.
Feels better.

361
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,615
Smart,
getting necklace advice

362
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,949
from a guy with no neck.

363
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,018
Wait. Is that--

364
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,821
That's the cupcake machine
that Han was talking about.

365
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,523
Ugh, no!

366
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,991
I was hoping
it'd be ugly,

367
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,327
but it's pink
and really cute.

368
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,596
It's like a gay R2-D2.

369
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,766
Well, a gayer R2-D2.

370
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,569
Who wouldn't want
a cupcake from this?

371
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,072
No one.

372
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,506
- We have to mess her up.
- What?

373
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,875
Why are you carrying
spray-paint in your purse?

374
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,744
For the same reason
I carry a tampon.

375
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,279
'Cause you never know.

We are not gonna destroy
someone else's property.

377
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,583
Well,
we have to do something,

378
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,352
'cause it's that machine
or us.

[Laughs]
Oh, I know.

380
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:19,023
We can open the little door
and put a poop in it.

381
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,858
Not one of mine.
Jeez!

382
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,626
What am I, a pig?

383
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,129
Well, I'm not doing it.

384
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,466
No, we just get some
puppy poop from the street.

385
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,567
No!

386
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,602
We are not
that desperate.

387
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,704
And I'm out of wetnaps.

388
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,907
No, see, we already
met Martha.

389
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,642
We're just stopping by
to say hi.

390
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,044
You've already
met Martha.

Yes.

393
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,482
Martha Stewart
asked us for our card.

394
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,184
Martha Stewart
asked you for your card.

395
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,619
And where should
I tell Martha

396
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,887
she asked for your card?

397
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,322
In the ladies' room.

398
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,090
Martha Stewart
asked you for your card

399
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,959
- in the ladies' room.
- Okay.

400
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,061
Don't make it sound like that.
It happened.

401
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,295
We cornered her
in the ladies' room and--

402
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,431
Okay, don't make it
sound like that either.

403
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,633
We went to a gala
on the off chance

404
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,868
that she would be
gracious enough

405
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,202
to try one of our cupcakes
and she did.

406
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,370
She was very gracious.

407
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,139
Yeah, maybe cornered
was the wrong word.

408
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,007
It's not like we went there
to hunt her down.

409
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,077
It's not like you went there
to hunt her down.

410
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,745
It's not.

411
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,147
Okay, I hear your tone.

412
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,848
I see what's
going down here.

413
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,517
You think I'm some
kind of a problem.

414
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,253
Well, for the record,
Martha came on to me.

415
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,988
All right. Okay.

416
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,323
This is not going as well
as we had hoped.

417
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,692
Don't know how it could
without my magic pearls.

418
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,994
Okay, look.

419
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,462
I get that you're not
gonna let us up there.

420
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,097
And I don't blame you,
what, with this one

talking about magic.

422
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,534
But just so you know,
we are not lying.

423
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,635
It happened.

424
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,803
And after
we hunted her down--

425
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,838
because, yeah,
you got us on that, we did--

426
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,273
Martha told us

427
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,042
she liked our
entrepreneurial drive.

428
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,711
Well, that does
sound like Martha.

429
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,847
Okay, I'll send these up.
Have a seat.

430
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,116
Ahh, thank you so much.

431

And here, uh,
please take one,

432
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,186
just so you can
see for yourself

433
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,821
why Martha
asked for our card.

434
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,589
Well, I was gonna
get a cupcake

435
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,257
from that cute machine
downstairs later.

436
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,525
Oh, don't.

437
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,093
I heard someone found
something nasty in that...

438

What is that?
Is it--

448
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,145
is that glass?

449
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,013
No, it's a pearl.

450
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,715

our big break.

because of Martha either.

is no such thing as good luck.

00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,039
I will leave.

537
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,941
But only because
you have eyes of a python,

538
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,043
and I have possible U.T.I.

539
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,714
Sophie...

540
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,550
Why don't you just admit it,
you and Oleg?

541
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:47,785
What?

542
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,520
It's not like I want him.

543
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,522
It's just that
where I come from,

544
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,824
you never
throw anything away.

545
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,261
Here you go, ladies.

546
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,964
Enjoy the extra tips
from your credit cards,

547
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,299
because when Han
flips that switch,

548
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,101
the only tip
I can give you is,

549
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,270
don't wash your hair
every day.

550
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,639
It dries it out.

551
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,575
Okay.
Here comes the future.

552
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,311
One, two--

553
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,947
[electricity crackles]

554
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,115
[Sighs]

555
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,185
This old building
sucks me so hard.

556
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,954
Congratulations, ladies.

557
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,223
This is your lucky night.

558
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,325
Speaking of luck,

559
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,060
here are your pearls.

560
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,062
I found most of them,
but I think

561
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,163
Chestnut ate a few.

562
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,698
You can dig for those
later yourself.

563
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,066
Max.

564
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,534
And it won't
look the same,

565
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,570
because you have to string them
on this cheap-ass wire

566
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,639
I got at the hipster
bead store...

567
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,575
Beading Off.

568
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,310
We can add this
Earl bonus money

569
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,578
to our cupcake business total.

570
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,613
Yeah, that 150
will really put a dent

571
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,548
in the 250,000 we need.

572
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,650
We'll get there, Max.

573
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,118
Because you and
I have something

574
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,020
Martha Stewart
and machines don't.

575
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,154
Unpaid bills?

576
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:59,256
Mushrooms growing
on our bathroom rug?

577
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,191
No, each other.

578
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,193
Aww, a year later
you're still

579
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,096
trying to get me
to feel things.

580
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,364
Do you wanna know
the real reason

581
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,500
I thought this necklace
was so lucky?

582
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,936
I was wearing it
the day I met you.

583
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,471
So, I'm gonna
have some extras

584
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,040
do you wanna
make one for yourself?

585
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,875
Nah, I've had
plenty of pearl necklaces,

586
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,878
and I find them
more sticky than lucky.

587
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,047
[Cell phone chimes]

588
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,483
Max,
ms@marthastewartinc.com.

589
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,786
"Haven't forgotten
about you, girls.

590
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,287
Martha Stewart."

591
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,056
Just when
I thought I was out,

592
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,992
she pulls me
back in again.
