00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:04,074
Earl, time to play
"Marry, Sleep with, or Kill:

3
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:07,911
Ladies, booth one?

4
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:10,632
Sleep with, sleep with,
<i>slept</i> with.

5
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:12,583
Nice.

6
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,269
Okay, Max,
the dude at table ten.

7
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:18,505
Is there a "Throw food
in the cage and run" category?

8
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:19,940
Hey, jump in.

9
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:21,525
We'playing "Marry,
Sleep with, or Kill:"

00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:22,976
Diner edition."

11
00:00:23,478 --> 00:00:25,529
No, if I slept with
anyone in this diner,

12
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,315
I'd kill myself.

13
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:29,650
Even in a fictional scenario,

14
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:32,036
I cannot permit myself
to go there.

15
00:00:32,038 --> 00:00:34,371
Girl, you'd take the fun
out of the punch bowl

16
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:36,290
full of cocaine.

17
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,292
Okay, fine.

18
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:40,828
Sleep with Earl, marry you.

19
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,496
Not us!
Jeez.

20
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,197
What are you, a freak?

21
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:47,751
I feel uncomfortable,
Caroline.

22
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:51,055
Like, I don't know
how to look at you anymore.

23
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:54,541
Now, I can only see you
in a creepy lady tux.

24
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:56,393
You said it was just a game!

25
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:59,348
I'm not in love with you.
Back off!

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,733
It was just a joke, Earl.

27
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:04,685
The things we say
in jest, darling.

28
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:07,521

Max's Homemade Cupcakes
is at capacity.

Hey, we might
even be overbooked,

36
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:31,597
because in my experience,
even when guys

37
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,866
say they're not going
to come, they do.

38
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,504
Caroline, booth two
has been waiting

39
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:40,073
for service for ten minutes!

40
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,941
And Han knows
how frustrating that is,

41
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:44,995
'cause he's been waiting
to be serviced for years.

42
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:47,997
Not that it's any
of your business, Max,

43
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:50,618
but I have a very active
sex life.

44
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,922
So then, Han, will you be
bringing a date tomorrow night?

45
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:58,292
Ah, no.

46
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:03,763
You do understand that sex
involves two people, right?

47
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:08,017
And that one of those people
has to be you?

48
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:09,352
What is all this dirty talk?

49
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:12,522
This is a diner,
not a dirty talking place.

50
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:14,640
Sorry, Han, I know
we still work here at night.

51
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:16,225
I'll go right over
to the booth.

52
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:18,394
We were just talking
about our big opening party.

53
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:21,764
All you ever talk
about is your big opening.

54
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,901
Now who has the potty mouth?

55
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:31,407
Max, I need
your guest list names.

56
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,459
Oh, okay, I'm still waiting
for them to confirm,

57
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:34,794
so just put me down for ten.

58
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:36,829
Okay, but I need
their names asap.

59
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:38,080
I'm running a tight door.

60
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:39,165
I got a bouncer
from a local club

61
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,583
to donate his time.

62
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:44,036
I told him it
was a charity event for eczema.

63
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,806
What? We'll make a big donation
when we're successful,

64
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:48,224
but, for tomorrow,
every now and then,

65
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:50,843
scratch a little?

66
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:54,013
Hi, everybody!
I got great news.

67
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:58,484
What? You finally found
the thing we lost in there?

68
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:03,222
No. I knew we should've
tied a string on it.

69
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,442
No, look.
I got a fax from Poland.

70
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:09,061
My dream house is done!
Isn't it amazing?

71
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,496
It is amazing.

72
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:13,749
I haven't seen a fax
in, like, five years.

73
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,668
Sophie, it's so pretty!

74
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,169
Look at all this sweet
gingerbread woodwork

75
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,170
on the porch.

76
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:19,455
Oh, I'm so excited.

77
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,406
I'm going to be
on Air Poland flight

78
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,209
right after big party.

79
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:26,262
You are going to Poland?
That's news.

80
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:27,713
And when were you
going to tell me?

81
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:29,715
Um, now, yeah.

82
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,600
Um, I'm going to be gone
for a month.

83
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,135
Oh, okay.

84
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,687
It will be good
to have some time away

85
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,139
from the old ball and chain.

86
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,725
Yeah, he's not talking
about me.

87
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:42,479
We use a ball and chain
in our lovemaking.

88
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,733
That's the thing I can't find.

89
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:49,935
All right.

90
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:51,620
Okay, yeah.

91
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,405
Well, buh-bye.

92
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:57,076
I'll see you tomorrow night
at my big going away party!

93
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:59,628
Sophie, the party's
for our cupcake business.

94
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,916
Oh, see, this is why
I don't like you so much.

95
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,972
Guys, thanks again
for donating your time.

96
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:11,757
It's fundraisers like this
that will help

97
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,094
put an end
to undescended testicles.

98
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:17,229
Hi!

99
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,964
I'd like to meet the owner
of this awesome

100
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,599
and totally cool cupcake shop?

101
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,902
Oh, nevermind!
That's me.

102
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,054
Max, you got a blow-out!

103
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,589
Yeah, I'd figured
I finally see

104
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,110
what all the fuss
about getting blown is.

105
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:33,829
Oh, hi, we're not
quite ready for guests yet.

106
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:37,166
Girl, I'm your doorman, Nevel.

107
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,951
Oh, I'm confused.
I thought my doorman was--

108
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:41,453
Straight, white, and boring?
He was.

109
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,255
Then, boring came down
with the flu.

110
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:47,126
Now, you've got gay, black,
and definitely not boring.

111
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:48,460
So what's the charity tonight?

112
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,880
- Eczema.
- Undescended testicles.

113
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:54,383
People with eczema
<i>and</i> undescended testicles.

114
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:57,221
Lord, child.
That is a cross to bear.

115
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:00,523
Get me the door list,
and let's make

116
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:03,642
those poor, itchy boys
some money.

117
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:06,779
Another fake charity?

118
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:10,182
You've got some balls,
even if they aren't descended.

119
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,850
Max, we so lucked out.

120
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,485
Nothing says
"successful party"

121
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:16,205
like a bitchy, gay doorman!

122
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:18,157
Give me your guest names.
I'll write them down.

123
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,959
Okay, fine.

124
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,862
Put down Tommy, Dylan,
Robbie, Johnny--

125
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,965
Robbie and Johnny?

126
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,834
Wait, Max, are these
all your ex-boyfriends?

127
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:31,203
Perhaps.

128
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,988
Max, the invited guests

129
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,174
were all supposed
to be business contacts.

130
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,176
See, this is why I didn't
tell you sooner.

131
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:38,677
You're a control freak.

132
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,713
And for the record,
these guys have all had contact

133
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:44,049
with my business.

134
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,985
You're using our launch party

135
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:47,719
to get back
at ex-boyfriends?

136
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:49,554
Uh, yeah!

137
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:51,106
That's what success is for,

138
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,725
to say "suck it"
to people who dumped you.

139
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,778
"See my blown-out hair?
Suck it!

140
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,830
"See my cool cupcake shop?
Suck it!

141
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:02,201
See these in this blouse?
You <i>wish</i> you could suck it."

142
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:06,872
And here, it is not just
boyfriends on my list.

143
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:09,074
I also invited
the lady from Staples

144
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,509
who gives me attitude.

145
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,329
She can suck it too.

146
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,247
Fine, but how
is inviting Johnny

147
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,049
and his new wife a victory?

148
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:18,350
Oh, like this.

149
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,386
"Hi, Mrs. Johnny.
Nice to meet you."

150
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:21,887
You got him, but I got these

151
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,424
"And all this,
so suck it."

152
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,026
I'm not so sure
this is healthy.

153
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:28,644
Are you kidding me?

154
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:32,147
This is the healthiest thing
I've done in my life.

155
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,699
I even thought
about inviting my mother

156
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:35,367
to come and suck it,
but then she'd realize

157
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:37,286
maybe I didn't commit suicide
two years ago

158
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,989
like my note said.

159
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:41,624
I'm about ready to open.

160
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:43,826
Shouldn't we be putting up
some testicle banners,

161
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:46,879
or scrotum posters,
or something?

162
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:49,415
Also, there's a cute blonde boy
out here asking for you

163
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:50,749
that I'm about to eat alive.

164
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,051
[Groans]

165
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:54,053
That's Andy
with the free bar stuff.

166
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,337
Go, I'm gonna stay here

167
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,289
and practice my "suck it" face
for a while.

168
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,591
How's this?

169
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,844
That look
is so much more "suck it"

170
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:02,845
with the straight hair.

171
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,515
[Laughs] I know, right?

172
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:08,417
- There's my cute boyfriend.
- Hey.

173
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,935
How did everything go
at Spike's Liquor?

174
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:11,520
Well, I got
a little bit confused

175
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,105
about what charity
we're pretending to help,

176
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:14,940
so I told them
my sister's homeless

177
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:17,642
and my balls are up inside me.

178
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,745
Now, we just gotta hope
Spike's not the chatty type.

179
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:21,813
[Laughs]

180
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:22,998
Oh! They just dropped.

181
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,583
[Laughs]

182
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,669
Hey, Andy, question.

183
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:29,421
What does this face
say to you?

184
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:31,623
I don't know,
like, "I'm cool."

185
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,709
So close!
Guess again.

186
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,511
Okay, like,
"I'm better than you."

187
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:38,213
No, like, "I'm it,
and you can suck it."

188
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,852
Yes! Yes!
They can suck it!

189
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:44,269
Is that
what you're wearing tonight?

190
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:46,355
Yeah.
No?

191
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:47,556
A sweater?

192
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:49,274
I always saw you
in a suit tonight.

193
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:50,793
Run home real quick
and put on a suit.

194
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:53,479
Hurry, people
are starting to come.

195
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,864
Uh, Max is still
making the face.

196
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,449
I know.
I can't stop.

197
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:59,203
I've waited my whole life
to make this face.

198
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,489
[Giggles]

199
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:05,040
Max, look.

200
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,658
Our business is open.

201
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,294
Wait, wait, wait.
Not quite.

202
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:13,465
In five, four, three, two.

203
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,667
Both: Whoo!

204
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,538
- Name, please?
- Sophie Kuchenski.

205
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,841
Guest of honor.
[Cheering]

206
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:26,211
- How many in your party?
- See, I <i>knew</i> it was my party!

207
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:27,930
[Cheering and clapping]

208
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,787
[Lounge music]

209
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:38,256
Max, there's a line
all the way down the hall

210
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,157
and I've given out,
like, a hundred business cards!

211
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,395
You know what that means?
Being poor can suck it!

212
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,730
Girl, the Fire Marshal
just dropped by,

213
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,749
and told me
we can't let anymore people in

214
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,467
till some of these folks
go out.

215
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:53,320
Nevel, none of my guests
are even here yet.

216
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:55,188
It is very important
to let in any guy

217
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,274
who looks hot, but you know
would screw you over.

218
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:59,160
Is there any other type?

219
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:02,330
I'll go get
some more cupcakes.

220
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:04,831
Hey!
How's it going so far, babe?

221
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,033
Andy, what are you doing?

222
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:07,567
I told you to come back
in a suit.

223
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,253
Yeah, I know,
but I like what I'm wearing.

224
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,538
So you're telling me
you'll just go

225
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,173
and do what you want,
no matter how much

226
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,407
I try to control you?

227
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:16,593
Yeah.

228
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:18,379
That is so freaking hot.

229
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,932
Caroline!

230
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:24,085
Caroline, I can't get in!

231
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:28,474
Caroline! Less kissing,
more noticing me!

232
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:33,143
See, I know her,
and my name's on the list.

233
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:34,144
Han Lee.

234
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,196
Honey, if I was a fat girl,

235
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:37,481
and your name was Sara Lee,

236
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,900
you still
wouldn't be getting in.

237
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:42,619
We are at capacity!

238
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:44,905
Hey, Robbie.
On the list.

239
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:47,076
Go right on in, child.

240
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:51,714
Uh, hello?

241
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:56,833
Do you need a dictionary
to define the word "capacity?"

242
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:58,669
I have clear orders:

243
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:00,787
Only very hot men
who look like trouble.

244
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:02,956
Mm-hmm.

245
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,479
Excuse me, you know
where I can find Max?

246
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:11,798
- Yes, she's in the back.
- Cool.

247
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,151
Robbie, it's me, Caroline.

248
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:16,136
Oh, sorry.

249
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,938
Did we have sex?

250
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,189
What? No!

251
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:20,607
I'm Max's roommate.

252
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,276
Oh, Max had a roommate?

253
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:24,945
I was pretty much wasted
the whole time.

254
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:27,197
I remember, like, nothing,

255
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,701
but I'm in the program now,
so it's one day at a time.

256
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:33,503
- Well, Max is through there.
- [Chuckles] Cool.

257
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:35,455
But we did have sex, right?

258
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:37,323
No!
We did not have sex.

259
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:39,459
You offered,
but I wasn't into you.

260
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:40,677
[Chuckles]

261
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,864
Yeah, right.

262
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:48,303
- Hey, Max.
- Robbie!

263
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,688
Why are you making that face?

264
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,890
You have a toothache
or something?

265
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:57,144
No, it's--
I'm successful now

266
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,562
and this is my shop.

267
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:00,680
Wow. Cool.

268
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:03,283
So listen,
I'm an alcoholic now,

269
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:05,518
and I did a lot of stuff
that wasn't cool,

270
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,320
and I came here
because the program

271
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:09,523
says that I have
to make almonds.

272
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,211
"Almonds"?

273
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:17,130
You mean "amends"?

274
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:20,801
Cool. So, look,
I cheated on you

275
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:23,587
behind your back,
like, every day.

276
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:26,640
Well, um, we don't have
to go into all this now.

277
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:28,091
It's kind of a big night
for me.

278
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:30,594
And I stole money
from you too,

279
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:32,730
like, every time we had sex.

280
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,766
But we had a <i>lot</i> of sex.

281
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:36,933
[Chuckles] I know.

282
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:39,053
Well, I stole a lot of money.

283
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:43,323
Well, this just went
from "suck it" to "it sucks,"

284
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:45,158
so lift up your shirt.

285
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,812
I gotta get something
out of tonight.

286
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:49,198
[Inhales sharply]

287
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:50,998
Money well spent.

288
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,036
Just found out
I paid for more sex

289
00:11:56,038 --> 00:11:58,739
than an Arab businessman.

290
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,241
Maybe this wasn't
the healthiest thing

291
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:02,408
I could've done tonight.

292
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,760
So what do you wanna do?

293
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:05,963
Should I tell Nevel
to keep Johnny out?

294
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:09,349
Too late.
Way too late.

295
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:10,634
Max.

296
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:12,969
[Weakly] Hi.

297
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:15,088
You look even better
than I remember.

298
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,724
Well, I should.
I just got blown.

299
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,309
[Chuckles]

300
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:22,312
Suck it, suck it,
suck it, suck it.

301
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:23,780
Max, this place is so awesome.

302
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:25,248
It's like
you're telling everybody

303
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,234
who ever doubted you
to suck it.

304
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:30,821
No, we're not petty like that.

305
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:32,438
Hey, it's a little loud
in here.

306
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,757
You wanna talk in the hall?

307
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,327
Uh, wait, let me take a look
around my big, successful shop.

308
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:38,645
Yeah, I can go.

309
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:40,630
Keep your eye on Max.

310
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:41,965
That guy
in the Brad Pitt glasses

311
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,618
broke her heart,
and I don't trust him.

312
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,753
Max, you look insanely good.

313
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:48,171
Thanks.

314
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:50,223
Now, maybe you could repeat that
to your wife,

315
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:52,342
and where is she?

316
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:53,626
We never got married.

317
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:56,813
Max! Max!
I can't get in!

318
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:59,766
Wait, what do you mean
you didn't get married?

319
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:03,987
Johnny!
Hey, Johnny, I'm back here!

320
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,105
I didn't know
if I was gonna tell you,

321
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:06,306
but then I got your invite--

322
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:09,610
Max! Johnny!
I'm back here!

323
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:11,978
Should we just go say "hi"?

324
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,697
Uh, no, not right now.

325
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:17,167
Max! Max!
I can't get in!

326
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:20,170
Max! Johnny!

327
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,539
Max, I've been thinking
about you a lot.

328
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,008
Stop. Before you
say anything else,

329
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,594
I just have to say

330
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:28,964
I need candy.

331
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,683
[Mumbling] All right,
what were you saying?

332
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:36,521
I called off the wedding
because she wasn't the one,

333
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:39,723
and you wanna know
how I know that?

334
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:40,724
[Banging on glass]

335
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:43,727
Max! Johnny!

336
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:46,196
I can't get into the party!

337
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:47,547
Come here.

338
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:48,982
Help me out!

339
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,400
Seriously!

340
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:51,787
That doorman is a biatch!

341
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,792
Okay, so, uh--

342
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,961
[gasps]

343
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:03,213
Wait, what are we doing?

344
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:04,581
Making out
in a room full of candy.

345
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,667
Right.

346
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:08,919
No, no, this can't happen.

347
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,554
I was gonna give you
my "suck it" face.

348
00:14:10,556 --> 00:14:12,725
Okay, give it to me.
I deserve it.

349
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:18,345
Your "suck it" face is hot.

350
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,313
It's the hair.

No way.
No way!

363
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,638
Do I smell chocolate chips?

364
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,591
And is Uncle Andy
making pancakes?

You do, and I am.

but chocolate chip pancakes

How did you two sleep?

369
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,736

00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:30,955
Great! So what's
gonna happen now?

371

372
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:33,625
our big first day in business!

about you two?

374

Plbbt! I don't care
about you two.

Plbbt! Nobody cares
about you two.

Well, first, we have
to clean the party mess up.

Andy and I did it last night

378
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,387
when you didn't come back.

379
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,589
Um, can someone here
mellow out

380
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:50,725
and put some pancakes
in her pancake hole?

381
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:52,143
No, Caroline, I get it.

382
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:54,396
It's been a rocky ride
for Max and me.

383
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:56,097
See, when we met,
I had a girlfriend.

384
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,515
Which he never told her
about, and--

385
00:15:57,517 --> 00:15:59,384
And keep eating.

386
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:00,885
And because of that, Max and I

387
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:02,237
never really got together,

388
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,688
and then that girl and I
broke up,

389
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,723
and by the time
I saw Max again, I was--

390
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,742
Engaged to be married?

391
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:09,828
Yeah, yeah,
I was gonna get married.

392
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,562
Wait, to that same girlfriend?

393
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,083
Different one.
Different one.

394
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:16,567
Yeah, but that
didn't work out either,

395
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:17,752
and I've had a couple
girlfriends since--

396
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:20,955
[mumbling]
Oh! Only a couple!

397
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:23,375
Yeah, none of them
seemed to work out.

398
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:25,576
None of them are Max.

399
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,264
Hey, save me a pancake.

400
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:32,085
It looks like Caroline
has plans to eat them all.

401
00:16:34,087 --> 00:16:36,137
Well, Max, as far
as the "suck it" plan goes,

402
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:38,425
it looks like somebody
sucked something.

403
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:46,314
Pancakes, pancake hole.

404
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:47,315
He's a good guy.

405
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:48,817
Yeah, he seems cool.

406
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,453
Kinda falls in love a lot,
but hey...

407
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,038
And I did not tell him
to say that.

408
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,407
He never does what I say.
It's hot.

409
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:58,076
"But hey" what?

410
00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,461
Oh, we're continuing?

00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:00,579
Um, I don't know.

412
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:02,581
Maybe I'm partial, but Max,

413
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,832
you're an "A."

414
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:05,000
He kind of seems
like a "B."

415
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,802
Minus.

416
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:08,420
First of all, look at me.

417
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:12,207
I am clearly a "D,"

418
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,010
and I don't think
he falls in love a lot.

419
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:18,213
Man, I love, love,
love pancakes.

420
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:21,817
If I could,
I would marry a pancake.

421
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:31,494

Well, it's the first day open.

424
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,067
All those people are probably
tired from the party.

425
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,401
Yeah.

426
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:42,070
Oh, and look!
We forgot to light it up.

427

- Go to work.

- First day!
- Yep.

No one's here.

434
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:08,480
Remember: All we have to sell
is 70 cupcakes a day

435
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:09,798
to keep on track.

436
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,067
70 cupcakes?
That's not so hard.

437
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:16,039
Maybe we should
do the light again.

438
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:22,060

What time is it now?

441
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:35,840
Tomorrow, we only need
to sell 140 cupcakes.

442
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:38,977
140 cupcakes!
That's not so hard.

443
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:40,896
How many did we sell today?

444
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:42,931
Four.

445

And all were to Johnny.

a terrible mistake.

447

It's only been three days.

448
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:49,738

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,273
No, with Johnny.

450
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:53,692
It's different now
that he's available.

451
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:56,027
Maybe I'm the kind of person
who only wants something

452
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:57,412
they can't have,
and then when they get it,

453
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,197
they don't want it anymore.

454
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,617
Okay, but do you feel that way
about the cupcake shop too?

455
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,869
No, I love our cupcake shop.

I've ever said

what I have to do.

your mind about him now.

in the kitchen?

Yeah.

Yeah, I don't know what it is.

478
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:59,257

of a lot of candy...
