Earl, I told you to mop the entrance.

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,899
That floor is dirtier than Bob Saget

00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,149

A Midol and a Dove bar.

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,899
You watch it, too, Oleg.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,290
Like Earl's hip, you can be replaced.

Have you noticed since Max
and Caroline have been away,

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,109
Han is getting a little
big for his bitches?

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,149
Did I say bitches?

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,189
'Cause I meant to.

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,359
I will not be bossed around by someone

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,163
40 years younger than me.

15
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:46,184
He is not my second wife.

16
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:53,502

I mean, besides your blood pressure.

00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:01,292
When are you coming back?

21
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,162
We're coming back tomorrow night.

22
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,003
Caroline's about to sign
the movie contract,

23
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,104
which means I don't have to
come home UPS Ground.

24
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:11,836
Are you on the phone with the diner?

25
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:13,702

no one would see coming,

35
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:56,336
I used the F-word with Randy.

Who wouldn't see that coming?

37
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,966
You use the F-word all the time...

38

usually around children or clergy.

39
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,506
No, the F-word as in "future."

00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:10,296
Max, you made plans for the future?

41
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,426
You won't even make
dinner plans with me.

42
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:15,756
You always say, "Who knows if
we'll still be friends by then?"

43
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:19,756
Well, you always ask me,
like, five hours ahead of time.

44
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:23,046
Max, I'm gonna go ahead
and use the C-word.

I'm calling you and Randy a couple.

00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:32,636
You're right, bitch.

00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:34,457
See, Max, it all worked out,

right up until what I'm
about to say right now.

We have to take the shuttle
to the airport tomorrow,

'cause we're still poor for
another 27 business days.

and get a party bus.

After all these years, we still have

00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:51,826
such different concepts of style.

00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:54,456
With a stripper pole

58
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:57,696
and a Crock-Pot of cocktail weenies.

59
00:02:57,697 --> 00:03:00,116
I danced on a party bus for a year,

60
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:03,456

61
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:05,696
We are not taking a party bus.

This isn't your super sweet 16.

63
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,576
I didn't have a sweet 16.

64
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:13,156
I was in plumbing school.

65
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:15,196
Hey, everybody.

66
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:16,786
I don't know what's going on,

67
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:20,576
but people on the elevator
were looking at me funny.

68
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:21,616

69
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,036

70
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,656
Do I have spinach in my teeth?

71
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:29,246
Uh, no spinach, but about
25 needles stuck in your face.

72
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:32,536
Yeah, they're helping me get pregnant.

73
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:35,616
My healer Audra sent me to Mao,

74
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,826
the acupuncturist to the stars.

75
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:41,677
Yep, he's poked more famous
people than John Mayer.

76
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:46,906
Sophie, you're not supposed
to leave with those needles,

77
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:50,656
just like we're not supposed
to leave with these vases.

78
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:53,156
Tell you what, I'm gonna
do what I used to do

79
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,326
for my Aunt Becky at the Elks Lodge.

80
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:57,427
I'm gonna get some
pricks out of your face.

81
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:03,246
Max, do you think Randy
invited me to dinner

82
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:06,286
to witness him asking
you to be bi-coastal?

83
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,286
'Cause I don't think
this mascara's waterproof,

84
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,536
and I'm definitely gonna cry

85
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:14,036
happy and a few jealous tears.

86
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:16,196
I'm never been bi-coastal.

87
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:17,906
I was bisexual for a week,

88
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,757
but that's mostly because
I was hitchhiking.

89
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:24,536
There they are.

90
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:26,906
Oh, this is the table
where we first met,

91
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:29,036
and you thought I was a cheap hooker.

92
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:32,786
And you were only half right.

93
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:37,076
Here they come,
more jealous than I expected.

94
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,616
Let's celebrate.

95
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:40,246
It's a big night for both of you.

96
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,996
Caroline, your movie deal closed,

97
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:44,406
and Max, I found your sock.

98
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:46,036
It was under my refrigerator.

99
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,656
Oh, that makes sense.

100
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,786
I was trying to fish an
M&M out from under there

101
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:52,906
with a fishing hook I made
with a fork and my sock.

102
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:54,576
I was so excited about getting the M&M

103
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,826
that I abandoned the sock.

104
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:58,616
Max, you know you don't
have to eat candy

105
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:00,536
that fell on the floor anymore.

106
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:04,116
I still will, but it's nice
to know I don't have to.

107
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:06,677
Oh, my God, your whole
life is changing.

108
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:10,196
We're just waiting for someone else.

109
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,746
Oh, no, did you invite a guy for me?

110
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,456
I wish I'd known,

111
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,847
'cause I only shaved up to
the bottom of my dress.

112
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:19,696
It's not a date for you.

113
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:21,496
It's someone here for me and Max.

114
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,576
Wow, I don't usually
bring up threesomes

115
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,967
till the one-month mark
when things start to go stale.

116
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:32,326
Oh, definitely wasn't
picturing this guy.

117
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:34,496
Hello, I'm Elliot Charles.

118
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:38,866
Okay, two first names,
slightly more interesting.

119
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:42,406
So doing the orgy math here,
there's four of us,

120
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:45,637
and out of the four,
Max and I can't touch naked.

121
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:50,496
Her rule, not mine.

122
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:52,956
Oh, I'm not here in a sexual capacity.

123
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:54,746
I'm Randy's therapist.

124
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,496
And I guess we should get started.

125
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:58,286
I do have a 9:00 in the valley.

126
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,656
A 13-year-old girl is coming
out to her vegan parents

127
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:03,717
as meat-curious.

128
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,746
Um, what's happening?

129
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,616
Look, Max... Elliot?

130
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:17,656
Look, Max, my patient, Randy,

131
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:20,656
is breaking up with you.

132
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:22,406
(both) What?

133
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:25,786
Max, I know this sounds abrupt.

134
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,656
Elliot?

135
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:29,536
Max, in my practice, I developed

136
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:31,656
the ripping-the-Band-Aid-off technique.

137
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,616
You'll read about it
in my book someday,

138
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:34,996
if I ever finish it,

139
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:37,956
but that's between me and my therapist.

140
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:39,616
He's not speaking to me right now

141
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,656
because of a couch spill.

142
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:43,456
And I'd be mad as hell about it

143
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:46,177
if I didn't completely understand it!

144
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:51,866
And now, again, what's happening?

145
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,536
Because it seems like
you're breaking up with me

146
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:56,406
using a therapist.

147
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,746
It does seem that way.

148
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,786
Elliot?

149
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,757
He is breaking up with
you using a therapist.

150
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:08,366
Look, Randy?

151
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:09,757
Caroline.

152
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:17,456
Look, Elliot, you tell
Randy to be a grown-up

153
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:21,366
and break up with her over text.

154
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,557
At least send her
a "Bye, Felicia" bitmoji.

155
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,826
- Let's go.
- Max, don't go like this.

156
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,956
Elliot, don't let Max go like this.

157
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:32,696
Max, you're hurt.

158
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:34,456
You're feeling abandoned.

159
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:37,496
What would be really
helpful to you right now

160
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:41,576
is my book, if I can just
get one chapter on paper.

161
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:44,906
I think people would benefit
a lot from the book.

162
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,246
Well, we're leaving.

163
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:47,576
This is shocking,

164
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:48,857
and it's really hard to shock me

165
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:50,157
since that time I saw a mouse

166
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:52,597
dry-humping a potato on my couch.

167
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:55,956
You know what?

168
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:58,366
You can keep my sock.

169
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,456
On second thought, I need it.

170
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:01,746
Max, wait.

171
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,826
I am just gonna go,
because the last time

172
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:07,246
I was this mad,
someone lost an eyebrow.

173
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:10,656
And it took me a long time

174
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,637
to grow it back.

175
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:28,326
Thank you.

176
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:29,826
Max, hurry!

177
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:32,036
We have to leave now to
take Sophie to the healer

178
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:34,286
and still be at the airport by noon.

179
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:37,826
I brushed your hair
when you were passed out.

180
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:40,496
I can't move any faster.

181
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:42,727
I think this escalator's broken.

182
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:47,826
I tried to stop you from
drinking bottle number 32,

183
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,916
which was sriracha.

184
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:54,416
But you tied me to that chair so well.

185
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,746
Well, since drinking that hot sauce,

186
00:08:56,747 --> 00:09:00,126
I've been tied to a different chair.

187
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:02,826
I have something to
make you feel better.

188
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:04,246
I doubt it.

189
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,267
Unless it's a diaper full of ice.

190
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,307
It's not that. I'll meet you outside.

191
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:18,746
Okay, okay, remember that party bus

192
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:22,746
I never wanted and you
probably don't want now?

193
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:25,496
- Surprise!
- Good timing.

194
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,326
I'm feeling suicidal,
and I've always wanted

195
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:29,427
to be buried in something like this.

196
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,626
Aw, come on, Max, cheer up.

197
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:37,036
You're getting two poles
for the price of one.

198
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,706
This is the first time a party bus

199
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:41,706
hasn't fixed every problem I have.

200
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,206
Well, you haven't seen

201
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,166
my "Stars and Stripes Forever" routine.

202
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:49,267
[hums John Sousa's
"Stars and Stripes Forever"]

203
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:05,956
Um, Bert, is this rum

204
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:09,246
supposed to have
a cigarette butt in it?

205
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:11,246
If you gonna puke,
please aim for the floor.

206
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,036
I can hose it down.

207
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:16,286
Otherwise, I'm finding corn
in the pleather for months.

208
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:20,366
Well, if I throw up today,
it's not 'cause I'm having fun.

209
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:22,326
I'm just happy because, finally,

210
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:25,706
there's ladies in the bus
not wearing penis helmets.

211
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:28,826
Nope, they were all out of penises,

212
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:30,166
so I had to settle for balls.

213
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,786
Here, girls.

214
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,996
Nope, I will day drink on a bus,

215
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:36,916
but I will not put balls on my head.

216
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:40,706
And you wonder why you're single.

217
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,746
Ugh, there's that crazy
expensive sushi place

218
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:45,496
where Randy and I ate.

219
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:47,640
And there's the taco place
we had to eat at afterwards

220
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,366
'cause we were still hungry.

221
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:52,626
Max, please, you have to
put Randy behind you.

222
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:56,536
And there's the parking spot
where I put Randy behind me.

223
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:58,326
Bert, did we sign up for the Hollywood

224
00:10:58,327 --> 00:10:59,956
relationship death tour?

225
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:04,137
If so, I'd like to hit
the Affleck-Garner house.

226
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:07,576
And right up there is where he lives.

227
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:10,036
We'd make a right at that
super ripped homeless guy,

228
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,996
and in two or three blocks,
we'd be at Randy's house.

229
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:15,996
Oh, no, "we do this," and "we do that."

230
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:17,166
She's "we"-ing.

231
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,366
As long as nobody wees on the seats,

232
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,246
we'll be fine.

233
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,286
Bert, turn off there, up that street.

234
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:24,996
No, wait, what are you doing?

235
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:26,576
You're getting closure.

236
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:29,036
I want him to face you
without that lame therapist.

237
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:32,706
Just you and him face-to-testicle.

238
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:36,246
Ladies, just how stalker-y
are we getting here?

239
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:38,826
Like a drive around the cul-de-sac?

240
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:42,786
Or a full-on Demi Moore outside
of Mila Kunis' yoga class?

241
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,076
Ooh, there it is.

242
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,576
Up there on the left.

243
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:47,036
Yep, there it is.

244
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:48,500
And there he is letting the dog out.

245
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:52,286
Oh, and he's only wearing a towel.

246
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,826
Ah, yeah.

247
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,076
Now I get it, Max.

248
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:58,786
Bert, go. This was a bad idea.

249
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:00,496
No, this is a great idea.

250
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:02,366
I am not letting you
take this bad feeling

251
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,746
back to New York.

252
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,887
Bert, open the door. I'm going out.

253
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:12,456
Bert, close the door. Let's roll.

254
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:13,847
[knock at door]

255
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:20,206
I, uh, wanted to put some clothes on,

256
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,956
but Caroline wouldn't let me.

257
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:24,706
Oh, that's the smartest
thing Caroline's done

258
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:26,956
since I've met her.

259
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:28,666
Max.

260
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,126
(Max) I'm not here.

261
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:34,286
Max, I can see your balls
behind that pillow.

262
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,496
I can see your balls behind that...

263
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:38,576
Sophie! Come on.

264
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:40,126
This is sad.

265
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,427
Oh, well not from where I'm sitting.

266
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:46,366
Max, I'm sorry about the
way I handled things.

267
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,166
I just don't know how
to break things off.

268
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,366
It's why I was the lawyer

269
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,786
on the last three Adam Sandler movies.

270
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:54,126
Why?

271
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:55,956
I just need to know why.

272
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:58,286
Because I'm too young? I'm too old?

273
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,746
Is there someone else?
You're married? You're gay?

274
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,727
With a body like that,
gay is definitely on the table.

275
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,666
You want the truth?

276
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,666
I like you too much.

277
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,250
That's why I didn't
break it off sooner.

278
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,036
I didn't want it to end.

279
00:13:14,037 --> 00:13:16,076
That's why you're breaking up with me?

280
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:19,166
Because you like me too much?

281
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,626
At least have another family in Mexico.

282
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,826
Max, I've done the long-distance thing.

283
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:26,206
It's just putting off the inevitable.

284
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:28,826
You have a life there.
I have a life here.

285
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:30,996
It doesn't work.

286
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:33,996
Please don't hate me.

287
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,887
Be easier if I could.

288
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:39,427
Yep, here they come.

289
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,786
Pardon me?

290
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:46,456
Are we still firing
your housekeeper today?

291
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:49,036
Oh, nice hat.

292
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,206
Confirms that theory that women in LA

293
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:52,767
are the ones with balls.

294
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,319
This is it, girls.

295
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,899
This is where my healer
does all her magic.

296
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,979
Yeah, you know, she must
sweat a lot doing it,

297
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,399
'cause it smells like it
looks in here, right?

298
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,529
What do you think's in those jars?

299
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,029
Every fart that's ever
been held in at yoga?

300
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,399
Are you okay, Max?

301
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,729
I guess.

302
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,229
I just wish you told me closure

303
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,813
feels like someone just slammed my nuts

304
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:31,029
in the trunk of a Pontiac.

305
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,399
Sophie, we have to be
at the airport in an hour.

306
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,769
Yes, but Audra is my last
chance at getting pregnant.

307
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,819
She'll be ready when she's ready.

308
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,439
I mean, look around.

309
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,210
She's a professional.

310
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,080
[humming]

311
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,609
Have you seen an orange cat?

312
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,399
A little depressed, Sagittarius?

313
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,359
Wait, Garfield lives here?

314
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,319
Audra, this is Max and Caroline.

315
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,149
You know, I rarely say this to a lady,

316
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,609
but... oh, put a baby in me.

317
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,269
Absolutely.

318
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,689
Hmm?

319
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,269
You think... you don't... okay.

320
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,229
Go ahead.

321
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,319
I'm sorry, I'm just conferring
with my spirit guides.

322
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,750
Well, if you all talk at once,
I can't understand you.

323
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,109
Got it.

324
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,609
They're telling me that someone here

325
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,769
just had their heart broken.

326
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,819
It's you.

327
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,569
Oh, my God, Max.

328
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,269
Come closer to me. Come over here.

329
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,319
Oh, gosh, thanks a lot.

330
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,330
You're bogarting my witch.

331
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,439
These spirits don't lie.

332
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,689
Mm-mm.

333
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,609
A little too honest sometimes.

334
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,609
I mean, I didn't ask them
if they like my bangs,

335
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,029
but they sure told me.

336
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,439
It was a whole thing.

337
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,503
You don't need to help me.

338
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:03,229
I'll get over the Randy thing.

339
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,569
I've been through worse things,

340
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,899
like this right now.

341
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,359
No.

342
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,399
They're insisting that I help you.

343
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,649
Grab me a jar.

344
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,979
That's where we store the pain...

345
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,960
and lentils, once you're healed.

346
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,319
Great.

347
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,170
No guy, but now I have a
middle-aged lesbian lover.

348
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,500
[chanting, humming]

349
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,420
[chanting, humming]

350
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,500
All right, it's out.

351
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,729
I thought I was gonna have
to move to a bigger jar.

352
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,269
You must've really liked this guy.

353
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,859
He was okay.

354
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,269
Well, he's crushed.

355
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,859
He really liked you too.

356
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,643
Never thought a jar
could make me feel better

357
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:09,029
that wasn't filled with peanut brittle.

358
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,290
Oh, please, spirits, put a baby in me!

359
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,939
All right, here we go.

360
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,149
Quiet, everybody.

361
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,439
Let me just close the door.

362
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,939
Okay.

363
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,319
Oh, wait.

364
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,439
There's still some other unrest here.

365
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,439
[chanting, humming]

366
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,540
Oh, no, that's way too big.

367
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,540
It's something else.

368
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,229
Oh, really?

369
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,649
Oh, you're telling...

370
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,649
Sure, sure.

371
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,859
Okay. Hold on.

372
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,649
I can't put a baby in you.

373
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,479
(both) Sorry, Sophie.

374
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,729
You can't?

375
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,939
You made me put needles in my eyes.

376
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,479
Put me on with them.

377
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,729
Hey, I'm on your side.

378
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,420
Her bangs are ridiculous.

379
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,830
Hey, Earl, we're back.

380
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,439
Hi, girls.

381
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,649
Let me be the first
to say welcome back,

382
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,729
and also, my deepest sympathies.

383
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,109
How are you, Max?

384
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,319
I just flew in from LA,

385
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,819
and boy, are my arms tired

386
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,479
from hitting the person next to me.

387
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,319
They would not stop fidgeting.

388
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,229
I had to pee, and you
wouldn't let me out.

389
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,439
Max, Caroline, you're back!

390
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,370
I mean... hello, how are you?

391
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,269
Han, did you miss us?

392
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,979
Oh, please, I miss you like
America misses Radio Shack.

393
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,479
Surprisingly, it left a hole.

394
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,189
I saw you leave a hole once...

395
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,580
on Groundhog Day.

396
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,189
Max, Caroline, where's Sophie?

397
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,269
I missed her so much.

398
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,029
You know what they say:

399
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,319
absence makes me have to
masturbate almost constantly.

400
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,979
So what did the healer say?

401
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,269
We'll let her tell you.

402
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,529
Hey, everybody!

403
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,319
I'm back from California.

404
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,269
[with Californian accent]
I hope I didn't, like,

405
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,189
totally pick up an accent, dude.

406
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,149
Oh, I was worried Jeremy Renner

407
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,460
would make you the last
thing he'd ever be in.

408
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,029
And I was worried you'd say
something exactly like that.

409
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,899
Well, I'll be in my booth.

410
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,399
So what did the healer say?

411
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,439
How soon can we get a baby in you?

412
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,979
Oh, well, the truth is, Oleg,

413
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,189
the healer said that
she wouldn't be able

414
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,939
to help me get pregnant.

415
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,319
Oh, Sophie. Why not?

416
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,399
Well, the reason

417
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,040
that I can't get pregnant is...

418
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,870
I'm already pregnant!

419
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,529
Yeah!

420
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,029
I'm gonna be a father?

421
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,359
Yes, I'm three months along.

422
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,319
Yeah, no, that's the last time

423
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,479
I'll buy a pregnancy test off a boat.

424
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,529
Well, let's bust out the very cheap,

425
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,479
non-alcoholic champagne.

426
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,319
Non-alcoholic?

427
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,479
Yeah, Sophie can't drink
when she's pregnant.

428
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,769
Oh, all right.

429
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,769
Well, then, the five martinis

430
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,870
that I had on the plane were my last.

431
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,210
