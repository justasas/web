15
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:43,666

Yo, B, one more thing.

Yes, the one

What is she saying
she has on you?

Well, she's claiming
she was fired

insider information

to hear it from me first,

White men without golf clubs?

174
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:39,020
So that's my plan,
and hopefully,

175
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:40,489
going on that show
will put an end

176
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,091
to all these ridiculous rumors
about my father.

177
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:45,929
Hey, Caroline.

178
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,265
Yeah.

179
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:53,969
The word on the street
is your dad's got a weenis.

180
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,571
Sophie, how did you hear
about that?

181
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:58,140
Oleg told me.

182
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:01,109
It came up
on my Google penis alerts.

183
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,745
I like to keep current,
see what the trends are.

184
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:05,514
You don't want to be
that middle-aged guy

185
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:08,617
wearing the same penis
you had in high school.

186
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:11,319
Great, now,
it's all over the Internet

187
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,555
and my shoulders
are all up around my ears.

188
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:16,258
Look, I'm too tense
to even shake my head "no"

189
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,261
at that liar woman,
which was gonna be my key move.

190
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:22,631
I need a massage,
but I'm broke.

191
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:24,966
Caroline,
I'll give you a massage.

192
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,370
Get ready for a sad ending.

193
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:32,274
And beginning, and middle.

194
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,842
There.

195
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:36,178
Oh, yeah.

196
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,913
How does that feel?

197
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:42,350
Like baby spiders
are dancing on my shoulders.

198
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:44,619
You're the first Asian
I've seen

199
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,322
that can't give a massage.

200
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,028
Hey, Caroline,
I'll treat you and Max

201
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,163
to a massage
at my fancy spa.

202
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:57,432
[Gasps] Cool!
I've never been to a spa.

203
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:59,167
The closest I've been
is sticking my arm

204
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:02,804
in the free blood pressure
machine at Walgreens.

205
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:07,042
Wait, that's for your arm?

206
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,914
Thanks for the massage, Han.
It was very nice--

207
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:15,650
Oh, you're still doing it.
I had no idea.

208
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:24,292
That was a-mazing!

209
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,878
I mean, a guy rubbed me
for an hour

210
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,048
and didn't expect
anything back?

211
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,151
This massage stuff
could catch on.

212
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:36,721
I could not let go
during my massage.

213
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:39,657
Oh, was letting go
an option?

214
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,993
I was close, but I didn't want
to get halfway there

215
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,662
and have the management
throw me out or something.

216
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:46,064
I'm just so tense.

217
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,966
Piers Morgan asks
some difficult questions.

218
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,502
Last week, he asked
the <i>Spring Breakers</i> cast

219
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:53,738
their thoughts
on the North Korea situation.

220
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:55,006
Shh!

221
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:56,474
Sorry.

222
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:59,277
Max, this is a quiet room.
We have to be quiet.

223
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,746
Hi, girls!

224
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:05,083
Oh, I'm getting myself
some fancy water.

225
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:08,820
Look, they got lemon,
orange, and cucumber.

226
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,790
Ha! It's like a slot machine
over here.

227
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,326
Shh!

228
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:23,535
Oh, I just had
the best bamboo massage.

229
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:25,570
Oh, they kept whacking me
with it

230
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:30,542
until I confessed to stealing
that bread when I was seven.

231
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,311
Oh, what a load off.

232
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:36,781
Caroline, you still look
a little tense,

233
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:39,417
but I guess having to talk
about your father's junk

234
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:43,821
on national television
will do that to a girl.

235
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:46,424
I will not be speaking
about my father's "junk"

236
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:47,825
on television.

237
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:50,728
No, I can't have lunch
tomorrow.

238
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:54,032
I'm doing
<i>Piers Morgan Live.</i>

239
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:58,336
You won't believe
what just happened.

240
00:10:58,337 --> 00:11:01,239
You joined
a demonic cult?

241
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,575
Sandra, the liar writing
the tell-all book,

242
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:05,443
just walked in.
[Gasps]

243
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:07,979
She's getting
a day of beauty too?

244
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,516
This is like the gayest training
for a fight ever.

245
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,718
Sandra?

246
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,220
Right this way.

247
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:16,888
Lay face down.

248
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,224
I'll give you a few minutes
and I'll be right back in.

249
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,159
Perfect.
I really need this massage.

250
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,161
Promoting my new book
is exhausting.

251
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:24,729
I'm sorry
if that sounded braggy,

252
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,097
but I guess
that's how you sound

253
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:28,399
when things are going
so great for you.

254
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,336
Ugh! That poor masseuse
is gonna be forced

255
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:33,838
to listen to her yammer on
about her dumb book.

256
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,374
But then again, mine
had to hear me constantly say,

257
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,878
"don't be afraid
of the boobs."

258
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,014
We should be hearing
about that dumb book

259
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:44,549
so I know
what I'm up against.

260
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,151
If there was only a way
to get in that room.

261
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:52,757
Oh, anyone can get into
any room if they really want to.

262
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:54,926
I mean, do you think
that I was invited

263
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:58,196
to the audition
for the 2004 boat show?

264
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:00,431
Yeah.
Go.

265
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:02,700
I'll take care
of that masseuse.

266
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,869
Sophie, you're not gonna
hurt her, right?

267
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,706
No. I'm gonna try
tipping her first.

268
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:19,417
I'm back.

269
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:21,786
Yes, I was just
out in the hall with you,

270
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,389
now, here I am
in the room with you,

271
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,891
the same person.

272
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:32,230
Just keep your head down,
don't look up, and relax.

273
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,132
You're not gonna talk a lot,
are you?

274
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:37,035
No, but you should
feel free to.

275
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,871
Whatever's on your mind
or in in that book.

276
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:41,306
[Chimes jingling]
What?

277
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,907
What was that?

278
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:44,242
That?

279
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:46,344
That's just me, alone,

280
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:49,213
creating a healing space
with energy and sound.

281
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:50,581
[Chimes jingling]

282
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:53,351
Lots of sound.

283
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:56,254
So you're writing
a big book.

284
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:58,923
Do you want to tell me
all about that?

285
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:01,025
Well, it's about this guy,
Martin Channing.

286
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:06,431
Oh, he is very nice
and very respectable.

287
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,399
You won't think that
after you read my book.

288
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,835
I am really gonna
stick it to him.

289
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:12,570
Okay, now,
you're just pushing me.

290
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:14,772
Ugh!

291
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:18,476
Uh, how did you--

292
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:26,084
uh... How--
how did you do that?

293
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:29,354
It feels like
you have three hands.

294
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,260
That's how good I am.

295
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:38,730
This is supposed to be
a hot stone massage.

296
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:40,665
Comin' right up.

297
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,533
[Chimes jingling]

298
00:13:42,534 --> 00:13:44,702
The hot stones.

299
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:50,341
[Chimes jingling]
Oh!

300
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:56,748
All right, here come
the ho-o-ot stones.

301
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:00,151
Oh!

302
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,287
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's nice.

303
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:04,856
I'm really loosening up.

304
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,824
Oh, well, then let's
loosen you up some more.

305
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,059
More stones.

306
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,327
[Mouthing words]

307
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,796
More stones!

308
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:18,403
Yeah, I'm got paid a lot
of money for my tell-all book,

309
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:20,671
and I am really gonna
tell all.

310
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:25,243
Oh! Not there!
Not there.

311
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:27,578
What?
What is going on in here?

312
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,981
Well, what is
happening here, Sandra,

313
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:31,849
is you're about to go
on national TV

314
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,684
and tell America lies
about my father.

315
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,052
He never slept with you.

316
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:38,189
Oh. Did he never sleep with me
in your bedroom,

317
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,792
on your pink canopy bed?

318
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:43,227
You know what?
That never happened.

319
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:45,163
That's insane.
You're crazy.

320
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,764
Well, it's my word
against yours.

321
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,167
You're gonna be
very embarrassed on TV.

322
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:51,636
But not as embarrassed as you're
going to be in the spa lobby,

323
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:54,605
when I tell everyone that
I was touched inappropriately

324
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:56,441
by Caroline Channing.

325
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,743
You are not gonna
tell anybody that.

326
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,344
Who's gonna stop me?

327
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:01,979
Hey, girls.

328
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,248
I was listening
outside the door.

329
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:08,052
[Low voice]
Everything okay?

330
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,386
Max, I don't know
if I can do this.

331
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:18,371
What if Sandra's
telling the truth?

332
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:20,206
She did know
about my pink canopy bed.

333
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:21,774
How would she know that?

334
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,444
Because everyone knows
Barbie comes with a dream car,

335
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:27,647
a pony, and a pink canopy bed
included.

336
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:31,017
There he is.
There's Piers Morgan, live.

337
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:32,452
[Gasps]

338
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,853
Do you think
it's too soon to ask him

339
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:36,656
to give me a discount
at Piers 1?

340
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:40,493
He looks dignified, like he's
not gonna ask about a penis.

341
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:43,329
But what if he does?
Max, I can't do this.

342
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,098
Give me your phone.

343
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:46,632
You need
to remind yourself

344
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,601
of the person your father
used to be.

345
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:50,870
Look, here he is
working with UNICEF.

346
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:54,474
And here he is water-skiing
on "Lake Rich Person."

347
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:58,211
Look at that smile.
Is that the smile of--hold up.

348
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:00,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

349
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:05,451
What's coming out of
the left leg of his swim shorts?

350
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:07,487
I think your father's junk
is trying to tell me

351
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,523
there's gonna be
six more weeks of winter.

352
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:12,692
What are you saying?

353
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:15,661
I'm saying,
someone had a tip slip,

354
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:19,298
and that is not
a small tip.

355
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:21,501
And as a waitress
and a loose woman,

356
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:25,004
I know a small tip
when I see one.

357
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:28,107
- Here.
- Oh!

358
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,077
Sorry, sorry.

359
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,914
She just showed me a picture
of Anne Hathaway's new haircut.

360
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:40,820
Well, this is good, because
it proves that woman is lying.

361
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:43,055
Yep, you just have to
show this to Piers.

362
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:47,460
I told you, I'm not
going near my father's penis.

363
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,128
All I have to do
is point out

364
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,130
that that woman
has no finance skills.

365
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:53,299
Unlike her,
we are taking the high road.

366
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,668
Max, are you sending that
to yourself?

367
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,407
I'm here
with Sandra Rosenthal,

368
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:03,009
who's just signed
a huge book deal

369
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,210
to do a kiss-and-tell

370
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:06,445
on disgraced financier
Martin Channing.

371
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:07,547
Welcome to you, Sandra.

372
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:08,648
Hello, Piers.

373
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:10,917
Thank you for allowing me
to tell my story.

374
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:12,752
It's a story, all right.

375
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:15,188
Wow, so we're right into it.
Okay, well, let me catch up.

376
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,023
My other guest
is Caroline Channing,

377
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:19,625
daughter of Martin Channing,
who, to put it mildly,

378
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:21,894
is claiming that your book,
Ms. Rosenthal,

379
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,763
is a bunch of bull.

380
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:25,064
That's right, Piers.

381
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:26,199
[English accent]
It's pure rubbish,

382
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,034
[normal voice]
As your people say.

383
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:32,371
That was perfectly American.

384
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:33,940
Right, then,
let me start with you.

385
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:35,441
Well, to catch everybody up,
Ms. Rosenthal's

386
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,376
large book advance really
has to do with something

387
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:40,813
that turned out to be,
by your words, very small.

388
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,081
Comments, Ms. Channing?

389
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:45,718
Psst! Psst!

390
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,954
I'd rather not comment
about that, Piers,

391
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:49,989
because I have class,
but I do have a question

392
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,491
for Ms. Rosenthal,
who was hired by my father

393
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:54,660
because she claimed
she had a degree in finance.

394
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:57,997
Ms. Rosenthal, if a train
carrying 27 passengers

395
00:17:57,998 --> 00:18:00,399
leaves Grand Central Station
at 9:00 a.m.,

396
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,103
travels 800 miles to Chicago,
arriving at 5:00 p.m.,

397
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:06,272
how fast was it traveling?

398
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:07,573
Well, I--

399
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:09,208
Simple math, Piers.

400
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:12,011
- 100 miles an hour.
- I'm sorry?

401
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:15,147
That's your answer.
Sorry, I'm a bit of a mathlete.

402
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:16,582
Impressive.

403
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,718
I've got a math equation
for you.

404
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:21,654
If a 3-inch train
is entering a tunnel,

405
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:24,657
do I even know it's there?

406
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:26,659
Ladies, this isn't
<i>Maury Povich.</i>

407
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,794
Psst! Psst!

408
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:30,663
Piers, I am simply
trying to illustrate

409
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:32,231
that she should have
been able to answer it,

410
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,736
had she been qualified
for her job in finance.

411
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:39,372
Everything that I am writing
in the book is true, Piers.

412
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,140
There is nothing
that I have said

413
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:43,409
that she can prove
is untrue.

414
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:51,117
Wait a minute, why is there
a woman under my desk?

415
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:53,252
Oh, is there, Piers?

416
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:55,888
Yes, my father
defrauded a lot of people,

417
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:57,590
and he's paying a price
for that,

418
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:59,692
but I'm not gonna sit by
silently while she exploits him

419
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:01,427
with lies for her own gain.

420
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:03,329
Piers, there's so much
about my father

421
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,598
I want you to know,
like he--

422
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:12,605
What is this?

423
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:15,074
Well... I know what this is.

424
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:16,842
I've got one.

425
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:19,278
But whose is it,
and why am I looking at it?

426
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,614
It's my father's.

427
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:25,184
He had a bit of a tip slip.

428
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:27,687
Madam, I don't know what
you're looking for in a man,

429
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:30,256
but this...

430
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:32,360
Is far from inadequate.

431
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:36,929
In fact, it's so far
from inadequate,

432
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,065
that I'm bringing this interview
to an immediate close.

433
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,301
Your book and you lack
any credibility.

434
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:44,571
That's it.

435
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:52,478
"Can you hook me up with
a discount at Piers 1 Imports?"

436
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:58,284
Hey, you know,
they'll probably come to you

437
00:19:58,285 --> 00:19:59,952
one day and want
a tell-all book.

438
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:03,556
Remember, we already have
chapter one, "sleep farts."

439
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:07,293
Chapter two:
"My new Stepmom Max."

440
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:12,231
Max, am I gonna have to defend
my father forever?

441
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:15,067
Probably, but don't worry,
I'll be there to help.

442
00:20:15,068 --> 00:20:16,402
Thank you.

443
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:17,236
'Cause it's a wife's job

444
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,739
to defend her husband.

445
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,742
It makes me sad to think
he's gonna be in prison

446
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,643
for the rest of his life.

447
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:27,213
Don't think of it like that.
He's not just in prison.

448
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:29,682
He's in Africa
working with UNICEF,

449
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:33,185
he's in Haiti, he's water-skiing
on "Lake Rich Person,"

450
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:36,024
and he's on the desktop
of my computer.

451
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:40,059
I should delete that.

452
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,031
Where'd I leave my phone?

453
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:47,433
Oh, God, are you guys looking
at the picture of my dad?

454
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:49,503
We are. Respect.

455
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:53,106
So very much respect.

456
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:56,210
Eh, I've seen better.

457
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,380
Every day.

458
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:03,916
Give me that.

459
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,152
Oh!

460
