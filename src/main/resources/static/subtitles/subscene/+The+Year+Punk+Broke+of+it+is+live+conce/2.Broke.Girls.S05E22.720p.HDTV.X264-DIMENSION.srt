1
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:04,608
Here's your grilled cheese.

2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:05,858
No crust.

3
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:07,358
Cool.

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,438
And can you just move

5
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,778
your coloring materials, sir?

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,028
Look.

7
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:16,108
Pretty.

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,688
I was born during the Great Depression,

9
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:21,148
and I never saw anything as depressing

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,478
as that grown-ass white boy coloring

11
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:29,028
in the damn coloring book.

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,129
I was born during a
Def Leppard concert...

13
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:37,978
And that is the most
depressing thing I've ever seen.

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,318
I'm gonna go school him.

15
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,608
Or, in his case, pre-school him.

16
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,148
Max, be gentle.

17
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,938
I think he's in the
middle of his terrible 32s.

18
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:50,358
Excuse me, OshKosh B'gosh.

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,108
I have a question about
your coloring book.

20
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,778
Why?

21
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:56,188
Oh, they're for adults.

22
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,358
Super Zen.

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,778
Super meditative.

24
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:00,108
Helps with stress.

25
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:01,858
You know what else helps with stress?

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,858
Sex.

27
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:06,478
And even if someone could get past

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,188
those boner-killing overalls...

29
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:11,292
you ain't gonna have any
of that if you keep this up.

30
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:13,108
Not to mention, how
stressful can your life

31
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,318
really be if you are carefully
shading a unicorn's ass

32
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,128
at 3:00 p.m. on a Tuesday?

33
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:29,852
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com</b>.

34
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:39,102
Pickup. Veggie wrap.

35
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:45,041
Oh, my God, he's having sex.

36
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:49,331
Oh, Caroline, don't be such a prude.

37
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:51,121
Oh, good, it's Sophie.

38
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:56,041
I was worried he was
at that bagel again.

39
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:59,001
Who says that a pregnant
woman can't have sex

40
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:02,621
on the kitchen floor of a diner?

41
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,081
The Health Department, Sophie.

42
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:09,182
Oh boy, sex makes me thirsty.

43
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:15,052
She just blew right past those cups.

44
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:19,621
Sophie, having sex with you pregnant

45
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:23,871
is even hotter than having
sex when you had the bird flu.

46
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,661
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm just as sweaty,

47
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:30,211
but I sneeze less.

48
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:31,911
Sophie, you're really not letting

49
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:33,711
this pregnancy slow you down.

50
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:35,711
You've already had more sex just today

51
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:40,081
than Caroline's had all year.

52
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:41,871
You're not even in maternity clothes.

53
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:43,871
Yeah.

54
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:48,541
Well, I don't need to wear one
of those frumpy potato sacks.

55
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,642
Yeah, because I'm a hot potato!

56
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,642
Oh.

57
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,371
Earl, what are you looking at?

58
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:04,472
I have no idea.

59
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:08,161
All right, Max...

60
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:09,451
It's time to have that

61
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:11,451
uncomfortable conversation again.

62
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,621
Okay, but I thought you
said it was a hard no

63
00:03:13,622 --> 00:03:16,711
on having sex in front
of the Today Show window?

64
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:18,211
Oh, come on.

65
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:19,831
My month here is almost up.

66
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,871
I have to get back to
L.A., and we need a plan.

67
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:24,831
We have a plan.

68
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:29,291
I use the NuvaRing I found at
the Burlington Coat Factory.

69
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:33,161
They really are more than great coats.

70
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:34,751
Max, let's get real.

71
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:36,501
Max doesn't like to talk about reality

72
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:38,161
unless it's reality TV.

73
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:41,661
Like the Cops New Orleans
episode she was on.

74
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,972
It's the only time Fox
has ever aired a nipple.

75
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:51,812
Uh, who ordered the Korean boy band?

76
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:56,661
Uh, can I help you?

77
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:58,001
Yeah, hi.

78
00:03:58,002 --> 00:03:59,451
I'm looking for Han Lee.

79
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:01,371
'Bout yay big.

80
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:05,541
'Bout yay stupid.

81
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,121
You're looking for Han?

82
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,711
Just Han, or are you trying
to collect the whole set?

83
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:14,211
You kind of look like this
Korean pop star named Bong.

84
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,661
Well, my bong is from Korea.

85
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:19,371
Uh, Han is not here.

86
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,871
Well, if you see him, just
tell him Hwang came to say,

87
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:26,001
if he doesn't call me
back, he's got three strikes

88
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:28,711
and no balls.

89
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:30,812
Oh, he knows that.

90
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:34,541
Oh, my God, do you think Han

91
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,001
may be in some sort of trouble?

92
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:37,391
I'm really worried.

93
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,891
Oh, J. Crew sale!

94
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:48,541
So, after we pay the painters,
the electrician, the plumber,

95
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:51,211
and, of course, the
bribes to the inspectors,

96
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:53,501
we have just enough money
left for what I like to call

97
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,541
a little "cash cush."

98
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:59,711
If that's cash we use for
kush, I'm excited about it.

99
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:01,815
We can't spend that money,
so pretend it's not there,

100
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:04,351
like you do with recycling bins.

101
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:06,711
Oh, no!

102
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:10,041
The rats are using our tarp
as their Superdome again!

103
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,711
I'll get the rat mallet!

104
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,911
No, don't get the rat mallet!

105
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:19,142
It's a talking one, get the gun.

106
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:24,142
Well, if it isn't Crouching
Loser, Hidden Virgin.

107
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:30,411
Girls, I'm in a bit of hot water.

108
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:34,041
What happened, you fell
into a tea cup again?

109
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,371
No, I'm in deep trouble!

110
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:40,621
You've never been in deep anything.

111
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:42,711
Well, wait, is that why
those scary-looking guys

112
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:44,371
came into the diner looking for you

113
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:45,951
and made some threats?

114
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:49,451
I remember something about
a strike and no balls.

115
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:51,911
Something about no balls?

116
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:54,041
You monsters didn't
get the precise wording

117
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,791
on a threat to my life?

118
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:59,621
I was a little distracted, Han.

119
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:02,831
J. Crew claimed to have a 50% off sale,

120
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:06,871
but then I clicked on the link,
and it was an "up to" 50% sale.

121
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:09,331
Mostly on men's suiting.

122
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:12,001
Oh, do send me the link
so I can select the suit

123
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:15,831
I'll be buried in!

124
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:19,331
Because you two can't
take a damn message!

125
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:21,371
All right, Han, what is going on?

126
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:22,761
Are you really in trouble?

127
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:26,331
Hey!

128
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:28,541
What was that?

129
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:31,791
Help me, strong, big man!

130
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,501
That wasn't gunshots, Han,

131
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:35,501
it was just a car backfiring.

132
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,291
What's going on?

133
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:40,661
Well, there's no easy way to say it.

134
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:45,871
I have a pretty substantial
gambling problem.

135
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:50,161
But Han, that's almost interesting.

136
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:54,291
Yeah, and I'm almost history!

137
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:55,871
In case you weren't following,

138
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,971
I'm in a lot of debt!

139
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:09,422
Han, my man, I'm here for you.

140
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:10,712
Tell us what it is.

141
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:13,922
Poker, ponies, football?

142
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:15,922
It's...

143
00:07:15,923 --> 00:07:20,382
ladies tennis.

144
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,962
Ladies tennis?

145
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:25,792
I didn't even know you played tennis.

146
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,882
Yeah, well, it's a vicious sport.

147
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:31,462
And I lost most of my money
on those Williams sisters.

148
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:34,563
Never trust a big butt and a smile.

149
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:38,132
You're telling me!

150
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:41,422
I thought the bad one was the good one.

151
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:42,962
How much do you owe these people?

152
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,382
Well, with the initial
debt and the interest,

153
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:47,052
I'm told it's in the neighborhood

154
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:50,092
of a black market kidney.

155
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,922
Those are pretty pricey.

156
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:55,592
I know, I have two of them.

157
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:59,462
Han, that's fascinating, yet disturbing.

158
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:03,462
Like when you use a black
light at a Red Roof Inn.

159
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,172
You're like an enigma.

160
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:08,942
Enigma, please.

161
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:14,962
Han, how dangerous can Hwang be?

162
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,002
His office is in a karaoke bar.

163
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:18,292
The only thing he's gonna murder

164
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:21,052
is the Hall and Oates catalogue.

165
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:23,552
Han, you have to face this bully.

166
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,842
And this is coming
from your biggest bully.

167
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:30,792
Now come on, do what I
say, or I'll beat you up.

168
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,292
Here we go.

169
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,752
Oh, I just remembered...
I need to get my sweater.

170
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:37,132
From my home.

171
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:40,233

00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,252
He looks busy.

182
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,422
Let's revisit this in September.

183
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:10,092
Oh, I see we have company.

184
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:13,552
Come in, sit down, give me my money.

185
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,092
Look, Mr. Hwang.

186
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:18,382
We understand Han has a
weakness for pleated white skirts

187
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,842
and over-developed thighs.

188
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,592
Slow down, let me handle this.

189
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:24,212
I have experience with
hardened criminals.

190
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:28,672
First off, killer Carly Rae Jeps.

191
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:32,552
Um, do you mind if a sister
does, like, five shots?

192
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,092
Look, Mr. Hwang.

193
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:37,252
Call me by my first name: Hwang.

194
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:40,922
Your names is Hwang Hwang?

195
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:43,592
Oh, you think that's funny?

196
00:09:43,593 --> 00:09:45,002
So did Kim.

197
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:49,552
Kim, show them your mangled genitals.

198
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:53,342
We're all set, mangled genitals-wise.

199
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:57,752
Speak for yourself, I'd take
a peek at them mangled gennies.

200
00:09:57,753 --> 00:10:00,712
Uh, perhaps we could put
an installment plan in place

201
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:02,002
for the money Han owes you?

202
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,382
How much is it, exactly?

203
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:05,212
$30,000.

204
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:09,092
On ladies tennis?

205
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:11,342
I'm sure we can figure this out.

206
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:15,353
Yeah, I have a free
pass to any AMC Theatre.

207
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:23,502
I should warn you, though,
it does exclude the IMAX.

208
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,252
Keep it, Han.

209
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:27,672
I've decided to give you a
little time to pay me back.

210
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:29,712
That is so cool of you.

211
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:30,752
How much time?

212
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,842
Uh, one song.

213
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,502
Right now.

214
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:35,592
And Han?

215
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,422
You better make it a toe-tapper.

216
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,592
'Cause when you're done,

217
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:43,252
you'll have one less toe to tap.

218
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:46,342
You're not really
gonna take off his toes.

219
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:50,592
Kim, show him your missing toes.

220
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,502
Come on, Han, it's show time.

221
00:10:52,503 --> 00:10:54,603
I mean, "toe time."

222
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:00,252
Oh, my God, this is like
when they make people sing

223
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:03,842
on American Idol after
they've been voted off.

224
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:08,002
Hwang, what are you
gonna do with another toe?

225
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:09,752
I mean, you think you need another one,

226
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,842
and then they just sit on the shelf.

227
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:14,792
If I don't take his toes,
then I'm known as the guy

228
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:19,252
who says he's gonna take toes
and then doesn't take toes.

229
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,962
Uh, can I peruse a song book?

230
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:26,092
It might take a while, I'm very picky.

231
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:29,092
ABBA...

232
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:32,592
AC/DC...

233
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,962
Adele...

234
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:39,252
I already picked you a song.

235
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:42,252
"Last Dance" by Donna Summer.

236
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,592
'Cause when that toe is gone,

237
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:46,462
it'll be the last time you dance.

238
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:48,192
Sing.

You heard Han.

252
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:48,752
He needs us by him,
beside him, to guide him!

253
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,172
Should we go and get the cops?

254
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:51,712
No, by the time they get back,

255
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:55,292
Han will have one less toe,
if Hwang even stops there.

256
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:56,752
What if he takes his whole foot?

257
00:12:56,753 --> 00:13:00,712
Han needs all the height he can get.

258
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,382
Didn't you say something about
us having a money cushion?

259
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,212
We can't use the cushion.

260
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:08,092
We need it for the dessert bar
in case we have a slow start.

261
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:11,592
Like we have had with every
business we've started before.

262
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:14,712

Han is annoying, nerdy, bad at sports,

269
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:41,592
but he gave us a cushion
when we didn't have anything.

270
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:44,592
Max, I want to help Han,
but I also don't want us

271
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:45,922
to wind up with nothing.

272
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:47,882
Again.

273
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:50,422

279
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:04,102
I had a bubble in my throat.

280
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:08,212
Chestnut, we have big news.

281
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:10,672
And something called mochi.

282
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:11,922
In here.

283
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:13,922
I let myself in.

284
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:16,002
Chestnut can talk?

285
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:18,103
Thank you, God!

286
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,962
What's up, good looking?

287
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,342
I still can't believe

288
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:26,172
you're dating someone
who looks like that,

289
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:28,502
and can read.

290
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:32,092
Randy, you will not believe what we did.

291
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,962
We saved Han's life.

292
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:36,752
Well, not his life, so much as his toe,

293
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:40,422
but still an amazing
gesture on our part.

294
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:41,462
Well...

295
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,752
long story about a short guy,

296
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:49,172
we bought the diner.

297
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,592
I had to get something out of it.

298
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,882
I mean, I'm not Mother Teresa.

299
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:55,002
You bought the diner?

300
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,252
The diner that doesn't
show up on Google Maps

301
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:58,632
for legal reasons?

302
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:00,502
That diner?

303
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:02,092
Why would you do that?

304
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:04,092
Well, not bought, exactly.

305
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,922
We got Han out of debt in
exchange for part ownership.

306
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:09,922
It's like, we spend five years
trying to get out of hell,

307
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:13,092
and then... we bought hell!

308
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:14,252
Crazy, right?

309
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:16,752
Yeah, no, real crazy.

310
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:19,002
When I think of impulse
buys, I think of Altoids

311
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,172
or a flashlight keychain.

312
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:24,422
Well, I guess congratulations.

313
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,926
Wait, what is that look on your face?

314
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,712
I've never seen it before.

315
00:15:27,713 --> 00:15:29,922
Are you mad?

316
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:31,252
Just surprised you didn't think

317
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,342
to talk to me about it first.

318
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:38,092
What, every time I buy a
diner, I have to tell you?

319
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,922
I go back to L.A. in three days.

320
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,382
You couldn't make a plan for that,

321
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:44,712
but you bought the diner?

322
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:46,752
That's a commitment.

323
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,853
Now it's done.

324
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:54,842
I should go tell Chestnut what we did.

325
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:57,943
'Cause he is gonna laugh.

326
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,752
I know what'll make this all okay.

327
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:06,092
Some jug snugs?

328
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:09,092
Yours, not mine.

329
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,962
Nothing?

330
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:12,226
Well, if we're not gonna do it,

331
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:13,252
at least put on a shirt.

332
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,752
I am human.

333
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:17,616
You really think you're
gonna have time for us?

334
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:20,592
Starting a new business
and owning the diner?

335
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:21,922
Yes!

336
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:23,672
I had four jobs in sixth grade,

337
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:27,292
and I still had time to follow
Smash Mouth around the country.

338
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:31,592
Not the band, a meth
head my mom really liked.

339
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:35,172
Chestnut had a big reaction
to the news, as well.

340
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:37,232
Where's the poop shovel?

341
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:47,986
Hey, boss ladies, congratulations!

342
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:50,486
I heard that you own the diner now.

343
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,587
Which is why I am doing double doobies.

344
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,446
Part! Part owners!

345
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:58,692
I'm still the boss.

346
00:16:58,693 --> 00:16:59,692
Put that away!

347
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:02,771
Doobie continued.

348
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,481
Who's the boss, Tiny Danza?

349
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:09,191
Well, I will be again,
as soon as I scrape up

350
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:11,061
the money to pay you back.

351
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,352
But don't worry, from now on,

352
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:15,453
I'm not gambling on anything
but lunch at Chipotle.

353
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:21,231
Hey, everybody!

354
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,852
Sophie's back and better than ever!

355
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:27,601
Like racism in America.

356
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:30,151
I heard that.

357
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:32,441
Wow, Sophie, that is some dress.

358
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:36,101
And there must be one very
cold leopard out there.

359
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:39,521
Oh, I like your style, baby.

360
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:41,351
I realized

361
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:45,811
I don't need to wear those
basic bitch maternity clothes.

362
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:50,021
I can be maternal without
losing that little whisper

363
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:53,122
that says, "I'm doable."

364
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,851
Yes, you are.

365
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:59,981
She also made a maternity
item for the bedroom.

366
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:03,521
It's called "The Pregligé."

367
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:04,731
Hey, Oleg.

368
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:07,832
Meet me in the bathroom.

369
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,192
Hey, Earl, I'm heading out.

370
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,376
I guess we'll never get to
do that Lethal Weapon reboot

371
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:18,391
we talked about.

372
00:18:18,392 --> 00:18:23,151
That's all right, I'm doing
a Rush Hour reboot with Han.

373
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,811
What're you doing with that luggage?

374
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,021
Did I get you kicked
out of another hotel?

375
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,151
No, I changed my ticket.

376
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:31,521
Going back to L.A. today.

377
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:33,231
But that's today.

378
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:36,391
And that is a ticket to Los Angeles.

379
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:40,481
Use it whenever you
want and I'll be there.

380
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:41,851
This is empty.

381
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:45,391
Yeah, everything's done online now.

382
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,021
I just did that for effect.

383
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,151
You'll get an email.

384
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:53,311
Good luck with your
dessert bar and the diner.

385
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,021
I'm gonna see you.

386
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:57,122
Yeah.

387
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,101
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

388
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,391
Why are you being so good-bye-y?

389
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:12,061
I'm gonna visit as soon
as things get settled here.

390
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:13,691
And we'll talk every day.

391
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,481
I'm even better at phone
sex than I am at real sex.

392
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:18,151
I find that hard to believe.

393
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:21,521
It's the only thing on my
resumé that's not a lie.

394
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:25,311
I'll figure it out. We'll make a plan.

395
00:19:25,312 --> 00:19:27,021
I know you think that.

396
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:29,231
But I think I was right the first time.

397
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:32,101
Long-distance relationships don't work.

398
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:34,691
And I think the real distance between us

399
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,731
is where we are in our lives.

400
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:37,941
What distance?

401
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:41,042
I'm three inches away from you.

402
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:45,351
You better get back to your diner.

403
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,452
I love you, Max.

404
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:51,492
I love you, too.

405
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:59,542
Okay, that felt really good-bye-y.

406
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:08,691
I'm okay, Earl.

407
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:11,792
This is for me.

408
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:16,811
I know this is really hard,
but you don't know where

409
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,271
this all is gonna end up.

410
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:21,372
Like you, when you ride
the subway on ecstasy.

411
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,191
Are you okay?

412
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,702
I am the opposite of okay.

413
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:33,731
You know, as the boss, I
could let you take a break.

414
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,391
I mean, ten minutes, tops.

415
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,021
If I give you more than ten minutes,

416
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:38,771
then I'll be known as the girl who says

417
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,101
she's gonna give ten minutes,

418
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:43,271
then doesn't give ten minutes.

419
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:44,891
I need to talk to the owner.

420
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:46,101
That's me!

421
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:50,351
Oh, that was really painful.

422
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:53,701
And probably worse than losing a toe.

423
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:07,124
