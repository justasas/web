1
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:06,273
Sandwich, burger.

2
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:09,441
Why the big smile, Han?

3
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,393
You going commando
under those corduroys?

4
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:14,896
No, Max, I am happy today
because diner clientele

5
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:17,075
has finally changed for the better.

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,200
Look, two parties of cool hipsters

7
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:22,122
are sitting at tables near wall.

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,917
You think those are six hipsters?

9
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,125
Okay, let's go over
this one more time.

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,421
Hipster or homeless pop quiz, ready?

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,045
- Ready.
- Hipsters wear?

12
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:32,048
Skinny jeans.

13
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:34,632
- Homeless wear?
- Dirty jeans.

14
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,470
- Hipsters listen to?
- Radiohead.

15
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,890
- Homeless listen to?
- The voices in their head.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,643
- Hipsters have?
- Beard and a blog.

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,187
- Homeless have?
- Beard and so much sadness.

18
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:48,649
I see sadness, there and there.

19
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,318
I'll handle this.

20
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,718
I told you before,
I don't want you kind in here.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,489
Take a trendy hike.

22
00:00:55,655 --> 00:01:00,786
Better step it up.
The apple store closes at ten.

23
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:02,788
Max, why did you
kick out the hipsters?

24
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:04,662
'Cause I could not
be in the background

25
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,865
of another Instagram photo.

26
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:20,906
Here's the last check, Earl.

27
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:22,884
And, Max, they stiffed us on the tip

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,359
but they forgot their camera.

29
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,777
Oh, I'll give it to Oleg.

30
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:28,881
He can take one of
his special pictures.

31
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:30,666
That way, when they
come back to get it,

32
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:32,852
everyone will have been stiffed.

33
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,120
Well, good night, ladies.

34
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,339
I gotta get home
before the snow starts.

35
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,824
It's not gonna snow, Earl,
it's 50 degrees.

36
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,743
Oh, it's gonna snow, trust me.

37
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:44,012
I couldn't tell
when my first wife was coming,

38
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:47,033
but I can sure tell
when a storm is coming.

39
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,304
All right, so what's the plan?

40
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:53,805
What are we gonna do if it does snow?

41
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:01,029
Opening my balcony doors
and watching it fall

42
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:03,815
like fresh white linen and
then running across the street

43
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:05,850
to the park to make snow angels.

44
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:08,687
Yeah, that's snow when you're rich.

45
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,522
The only snow angels
you'll see this year

46
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:14,326
are the six crack addicts
frozen to our stoop.

47
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:16,795
Oh, not to mention
the adorable frozen horse

48
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:18,747
we have illegally
living in the backyard.

49
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:20,082
Max, don't overreact.

50
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:21,049
Chestnut's fine.

51
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:22,167
It's not gonna snow for weeks.

52
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:23,335
All right, have it your way.

53
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:24,869
But I wouldn't want
to be the next tenants

54
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:26,538
who have to figure out
why a pissed off horse

55
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,541
is haunting a Brooklyn apartment.

56
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:33,712
I was cold and she thought
she knew weather patterns.

57
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:37,849
Oleg, take a picture of your
junk on this customer's camera.

58
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,211
Done.

59
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,504
Aren't you gonna ask why?

60
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,605
No need.

61
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:50,162
I just saw Oleg's...

62
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:53,031
Yeah, that might have been my fault.

63
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:57,002
Kind of a shock seeing it
for the first time.

64
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,954
Max, I don't like you implying

65
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:01,072
that I would ever
be cruel to Chestnut.

66
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,207
I'm not implying it.

67
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,876
I'm saying it outright.

68
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:06,028
It's winter.

69
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:07,929
And it's not like
I've not been thinking about it.

70
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,631
But Chestnut belongs
in a special home.

71
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,301
You belong in a special home.

72
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:13,969
I've done some research,

73
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:15,771
and I found a retreat
in the Grand Tetons

74
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:17,806
where newly-divorced women
come to hug horses

75
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:20,091
to help them gain back
their ability to trust.

76
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:25,197
The only Grand Tetons
Chestnut trusts are mine.

77
00:03:25,714 --> 00:03:27,783
Lady, you gotta get
a reality check real quick

78
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:29,201
'cause Earl thinks it's gonna snow.

79
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:31,703
<i>Earl also thinks the theme from shaft</i>

80
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:35,407
was stolen from a cassette tape
he sent out in 1975.

81
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:38,160
Shut your mouth.
That happened.

82
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:40,629
Max, it's not gonna snow.

83
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,830
I know snow.

84
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:43,915
We owned a ski chalet
in Saas-Fee Switzerland

85
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,801
and I think I know more than
anyone in this restaurant

86
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,003
about living in cold climes.

87
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:54,959
Snow is coming.

88
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,063
Yo, Swiss miss, you wanna have
a conversation about cold climes

89
00:03:58,065 --> 00:03:59,481
with Snowleg over there?

90
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,184
Oh, Max, I almost forgot.

91
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:04,152
The camera.

92
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:06,971
I think you'll be very pleased.

93
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:09,991
I made a little video as well.

94
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,310
Why are you wearing two coats?

95
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:14,112
Same reason I wear two condoms.

96
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:16,314
In case one breaks.

97
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:24,039
What the?

98
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,761
Well, good morning,
world's worst weather girl.

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,499
I have never seen so much sunshine.

100
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:35,767
You know what that means?

101
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,686
<i>Earl wrote shaft.</i>

102
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,748
Max, I know it snowed,
you don't have to tell me.

103
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,191
I'm surrounded by so much white
stuff I'm like Al Pacino

104
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:46,278
<i>in the last scene of Scarface.</i>

105
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,612
What are you wearing?

106
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,732
You look like a bag of
crazy garbage grew arms.

107
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:53,819
It's the hefty 2011
winter collection.

108
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:54,870
I gave Chestnut my coat.

109
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:57,989
This is the only way
to keep the snow off me.

110
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,158
Look at poor Chestnut.

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,626
What is he wearing on his hooves?

112
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,578
I cut up my Fendi cashmere leggings.

113
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,029
I grabbed them when we
raided the town house.

114
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:07,031
I thought ahead for me,
but not for him.

115
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,085
He is humiliated in
those ladies clothes.

116
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,170
He looks like j. Edgar hoover.

117
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:14,256
I've been out here
sweeping since 4:00 A.M.

118
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:16,508
But it just keeps coming down.

119
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,009
What is your problem, snow?

120
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,846
I used to love you!

121
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,931
Maybe we should ask your old doorman

122
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:26,217
"insert generic
Irish name here" to come help.

123
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:27,519
I know their names.

124
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:30,238
Day James, night James
and black James.

125
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:33,275
So your plan is you're gonna
sweep the snow away till spring

126
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:34,943
while the horse
is trapped under this tarp?

127
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:37,112
Which I'm pretty sure was
covering the out of business

128
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:38,730
Cuban restaurant down the street.

129
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:41,116
They were out of business
and I left a note.

130
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:43,702
What did it say?
"I'm loco, gracias."

131
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:47,005
No, it said, "sorry I took
your roof, hang in there.:

132
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,625
Max, don't be so negative.

133
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:53,178
Doesn't matter where
it came from, it's working.

134
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,631
I just need to secure
this tarp a little.

135
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:57,883
Stop, you were gonna climb on

136
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:00,519
an icy chair in six inch heels
and break your neck

137
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:02,103
and then I'm gonna be stuck
with a horse in leggings

138
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,222
and you in a wheelchair
with a chopstick in your mouth

139
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,418
tapping out, "I'm sorry,
I thought that would work."

140
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:09,260
I learned to build when I volunteered

141
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:11,146
with habitat for humanity.

142
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:15,200
Looking back, they had
so much more than I have now.

143
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:17,486
Okay.

144
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:19,454
I gotta go to my babysitting job

145
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:22,040
and when I get back,
you and I are gonna sit down

146
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,825
and come up with
a more realistic home

147
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:24,910
for j. Edgar hoofer.

148
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,578
Max, he lives here.

149
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,246
And I'm telling you, this is working.

150
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:32,283
What I'm doing is
actually kind of brilliant.

151
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,007
Now I'm worried about
those houses you built.

152
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:45,998
Hey, Peach.

153
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:48,767
Max, I have the most incredible news.

154
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:51,962
Lawyer finally found
a loophole in your prenup?

155
00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:54,556
I wish, no.

156
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:55,574
I just got an email

157
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:57,409
and I have made it to the final round

158
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:01,145
<i>of casting for
Real Housewives of Tribeca.</i>

159
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,281
<i>Real Housewives of Tribeca?</i>

160
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:04,816
They're doing neighborhoods now?

161
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:08,145
<i>What's next, Real Housewives
of from here to there?</i>

162
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,338
The producers are on their
way over and I want everything

163
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,508
to be perfect when they see
Brad and Angelina.

164
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,827
Uh, Peach, are you aware
that your children

165
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:19,881
are being eaten by clothing?

166
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,517
The snowsuits are Burberry.

167
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,686
And the padding hides
Angelina's weight problem.

168
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,688
Okay, you have to stop saying that.

169
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,273
She doesn't have a weight problem.

170
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,226
She's gained 25 pounds in one year.

171
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:37,699
Yeah, 'cause she started at zero.

172
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,518
Max, we all have
to look our best, 'cause ready?

173
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,489
The last spot in the show is
between me and Misty Mastbaum.

174
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,074
I thought she was your bestie.

175
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,328
She is, but my bestie's a bitchy.

176
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,963
She's crazy competitive.

177
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,583
As soon as we were
approached about the show,

178
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:58,053
she adopted a three-legged corgi
and named it Mr. Pickle.

179
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,872
That's crazy bitchy.

180
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,758
So now, I'm looking up
handicapped animals

181
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,661
to impress the producers.

182
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:08,396
Oh, you want a handicapped animal?

183
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,515
I got your handicapped animal.

184
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:15,520
I know a homeless horse
with gender identity issues.

185
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:19,107
I was thinking
something cute, but damaged.

186
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:21,177
Like a one-eyed French bulldog.

187
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:25,563
What if I told you that this
horse was a celebrity horse?

188
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:27,332
Tell me more.

189
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,950
My friend, Caroline Channing...

190
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:31,836
How do you know Caroline Channing?

191
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,289
She's my AA sponsor.

192
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:37,525
Makes sense.

193
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:38,360
Go on.

194
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:42,764
Anyway, she has this cute,
but crazy damaged horse

195
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,382
and since her life
flipped upside down,

196
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:45,800
he needs a good home.

197
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,303
Well, I'd have
to meet Caroline first.

198
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,606
Bring her by on Saturday.

199
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:54,976
Max, what an amazing idea.

200
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:59,230
Misty is literally going to die.

201
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,817
I am so thrilled
you have a drinking problem.

202
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,467
Did you have to
put him in my bedroom?

203
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,901
It was the easiest room
to horse proof.

204
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,388
You have so little of worth.

205
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,756
You can stop googling.
I already found

206
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,291
a perfectly good place to put him.

207
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:23,658
You're not still suggesting
I give Chestnut to Peach Landis?

208
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,465
Max, look at me.
Look at me in the eyes.

209
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,317
Are you high?

210
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:31,486
No, I couldn't find my bedroom stash

211
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,154
since you moved everything around.

212
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,972
Chestnut needs a home with affection

213
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,741
and Peach won't even
hug her children.

214
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,880
She pays you to do that.

215
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:39,577
That's why it's perfect.

216
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,029
She'll pay for the fancy stable

217
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,448
and we'll go and hug Chestnut
for her whenever we want.

218
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,221
You just need to
go meet her and it's done.

219
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:46,951
I have the DNA of a rich girl,

220
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,087
even though I'm lying in bed
with you in a tenement

221
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,422
and I bought
my dinner tonight with dimes.

222
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,291
Chestnut and I are old money.

223
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,792
And old money doesn't
parade itself around

224
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,961
in front of cameras
and beg for attention.

225
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,596
Hey, you're not
the only one with old money.

226
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,797
I've had a dollar in my jeans

227
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,050
I've been carrying around
for three weeks.

228
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,384
You're meeting Peach Saturday,

229
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,949
and we're saying good-bye
to the horse.

230
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:07,605
Why is getting rid
of Chestnut so easy for you?

231
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,974
Didn't you ever
have a pet as a child?

232
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:11,642
Yes, I had a puppy.

233
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,177
And after a week
of living with my mom,

234
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,680
he pulled the car over and put
us out on the side of the road.

235
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:18,087
She got rid of it?

236
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,201
Look, pets are not my thing, okay?

237
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,852
I already have
something needy and Fluffy

238
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,738
that'll die if I don't
take care of it... you.

239
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,126
Go, it's your turn
to go check on him.

240
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,795
No, I went the last time
and caught him eating my bra.

241
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,197
Don't exaggerate.
He only ate half of it.

242
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,583
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right,
I should be more positive.

243
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:40,471
One of my cups is half full.

244
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,058
What's going on in there?

245
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,343
I don't suppose there's any way

246
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:49,580
you took a giant dump
on your dresser?

247
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,549
You can't blame Chestnut.
He's probably nervous.

248
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,767
After wearing your leggings,

249
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:55,987
<i>he's getting ready
for his fame audition.</i>

250
00:10:56,374 --> 00:11:01,025
He's a maniac, maniac on all fours.

251
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,527
Oh, Max, here's something.

252
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,695
The Ivy bridge
riding stables in Brooklyn.

253
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,497
Only five Miles away.

254
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,082
It says on their website
that their horses

255
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,784
are featured in
commercials and films!

256
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:14,905
<i>Can you say Chestnut,
star of the war horse sequel?</i>

257
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,375
Did you take the weed
from my bedside table?

258
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,459
Look at me.

259
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,461
Look at me in the eyes.

260
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:21,984
Are you high?

261
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:25,800
Honestly... a little.

262
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:27,585
Close that and go to sleep.

263
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,604
No, I'm still reading.

264
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,523
Oh look at that, I just pulled
down your browser history.

265
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,757
Interesting list.

266
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,925
Kitten plays a keyboard,

267
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,595
kitten sneezes and
farts at the same time?

268
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:38,834
Give me that, that's private.

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,865
Kitten folds a t-shirt!

270
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,533
Oh, kitten rings a doorbell.

271
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:44,902
I thought you said
you weren't into pets.

272
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,037
I'm not!

273
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,373
It's a kitten ringing a doorbell!

274
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,994
He's trying to get in like people.

275
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,613
You have a secret
soft spot for animals.

276
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:58,466
No, I'm just into freaky kittens.

277
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,168
There's one who puts on
a snakeskin suit

278
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,587
and goes on a business trip.

279
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,806
That's not soft.
That is freaky.

280
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:08,125
Fine, you're telling me to get
a reality check about Chestnut.

281
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,677
But you need one too.

282
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,630
You're gonna miss him when he's gone.

283
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:13,931
Max, are you listening?

284
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:19,103
Max, don't worry.

285
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,638
I know it's all
gonna work out perfectly

286
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,806
at the stables tomorrow.

287
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,757
I'm not worried.

288
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,337
The man's not here yet.

289
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,456
Damn it, turn us around Max,
we have to enter again.

290
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:40,291
This is the third time.

291
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,426
Max, come on, we borrowed
these coats from Oleg

292
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,178
to make a dramatic star entrance.

293
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,379
If you want me to fake it again,

294
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,798
you have to buy me dinner
and call me pretty.

295
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:49,833
Fine, then help me down quickly.

296
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:54,105
I don't wanna be mid-dismount
when the stable guy walks in.

297
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,893
God, ugh.

298
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:01,279
You just sat on my face.

299
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:05,149
Like I haven't done enough for you.

300
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,534
Oh, hello, are you Tony?

301
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,851
Last time I checked.

302
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:09,537
Oh, jeez.

303
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,522
I'm Caroline Channing.
We spoke on the phone.

304
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:13,708
And this is Chestnut.

305
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,792
Max, step back.

306
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,377
Oh, great.
I'll just be over here

307
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,079
like the awkward father
in the background

308
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:19,881
<i>on Toddlers and Tiaras.</i>

309
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:21,799
Well, here he is.

310
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,034
And as we discussed,
Chestnut is a champion jumper

311
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,869
his dressage is impeccable,

312
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,860
he's ribboned three times
at the Hampton Classic,

313
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:30,174
and he comes from
a historically elite line

314
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,697
of distinguished show horses.

315
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:34,211
And he pees like
a civil rights fire hose.

316
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:36,180
Max, step further back.

317
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,548
Come on, let's cut to the chase.

318
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,319
He's nice, brown,
he looks sick in leggings,

319
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,738
and he's free,
so take him or leave him.

320
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,573
When'd you say he was a jumper?

321
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,891
From 2005 to 2010.

322
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,560
He was in a class by himself.

323
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:51,495
Well, maybe he was a jumper,

324
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,247
but he isn't anymore.

325
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:54,220
What?

326
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:55,638
Well, he's a little out of shape.

327
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:57,835
Well, you have a gut.

328
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:00,454
Whoa! I'm just saying
he's seen better days.

329
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:02,623
I'm just saying your hair
is falling out in fistfuls.

330
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,575
- Whoa!
- Okay, okay.

331
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,677
Let's not get personal,
we all want this to work.

332
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,733
He's the one who's getting personal

333
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,360
going after Chestnut like that.

334
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:10,965
Okay, you tell me,

335
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,613
when's the last time he's exercised?

336
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,435
When's the last time you exercised?

337
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:17,388
Wow, show business is rough.

338
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:19,056
All right, it's Tony, right?

339
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:20,524
Last time I checked.

340
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,443
All right, Tony,
you'll have to forgive her.

341
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,029
She really loves him
and wants this to work out.

342
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,898
Bottom line is,
even a free horse isn't free.

343
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,100
I still have to feed him
and take care of him

344
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,270
and truth be told, this horse
isn't gonna make me a penny.

345
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,273
If my film guy comes in here,
he's gonna pick that beauty

346
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,242
over this one.

347
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:40,057
Oh.

348
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:42,830
So it's not gonna work out, girls.

349
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:46,000
All right, well, we got
other offers, fatty.

350
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,219
Come on, let's go.

351
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:52,473
You know, maybe next time
before you let someone

352
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,843
ride five Miles across
Brooklyn in a toxic, Russian,

353
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:57,241
cologne-soaked rent-a-fur,

354
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,347
you should be clear
that the film business,

355
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:02,767
even for horses,
is ageist and elitist.

356
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,819
And, yes, we may have
seen better days,

357
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,438
but with hard work,
determination and a little luck,

358
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,139
one day we'll be back on top.

359
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:13,077
Yeah, and I'm not impressed by
your big star pony over there.

360
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,478
He's just standing still.

361
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,496
You wanna impress me?

362
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:20,001
Have him meow and ring the doorbell.

363
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,869
Don't take it personally, Chestnut.

364
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,138
Those horses have had work done.

365
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:33,197
maybe you wanna take the cinch
sack off before you meet Peach.

366
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,272
No it's snowing again
and I'm a penniless beggar.

367
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,917
I should look like one.

368
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,935
Besides, she'll probably
think it's a look.

369
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,320
All right, I know this one on one

370
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:41,772
with Peach isn't your ideal scenario,

371
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,106
but it's what's best for Chestnut

372
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,865
so man up and face reality.

373
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:47,576
You're right.

374
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:52,540
And my friend, Caroline Channing...

375
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:53,624
What is it?

376
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,335
You might be ready to face reality,

377
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:57,921
but are you ready to face reality TV?

378
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,389
The place is crawling
with Peach clones

379
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,924
and TV cameras ready to meet you.

380
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,007
She totally set us up.

381
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:03,677
Are you kidding me?

382
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,296
Fabulous, this is awesome,
just awesome.

383
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,964
She's using the Caroline
Channing freak show

384
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,557
to get herself on another freak show.

385
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:11,475
All right, you're right, let's
go, you don't have to do this.

386
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:14,238
No, if I made Chestnut parade around

387
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,823
and be humiliated in public,

388
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:18,141
then I have to be
willing to do the same.

389
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,145
Here, hold my coat.

390
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,779
You always have those with you?

391
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:27,992
Yes, I'm from Manhattan.

392
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:30,286
- Okay, thank me for coming.
- What?

393
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,339
Thank me for coming, that's
what people did all the time

394
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:34,424
when I was a billionaire.

395
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,926
Thank you for coming.

396
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,587
No, thank you for inviting me.

397
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:42,131
Wow, that's so cool.

398
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:45,552
Don't freak out.

399
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:48,672
I'm about to get my rich on.

400
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,264
So when we go in there
I'll introduce you?

401
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,358
Oh, you don't have to.

402
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,359
Rich people always pretend

403
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,477
to know each other.

404
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,812
Now open that door,

405
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,897
and let's get my baby a home.

406
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:01,819
Peach.

407
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,955
I wanna thank you for inviting
me into your beautiful home

408
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,874
and showing me such kindness

409
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:10,451
during this very difficult,
difficult time.

410
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:13,914
Ladies, I would like you all to meet

411
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,050
my dear friend, Caroline Channing.

412
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:21,204
Who, in light of her recent
very difficult, difficult

413
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:27,060
financial troubles, has asked me
to adopt her damaged pet horse

414
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:31,815
who was brought to my attention
by my alcoholic servant, Max.

415
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:36,143
Right over there.

416
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:39,773
Caroline,

417
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,190
thank you for coming.

418
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:44,568
No, thank you for inviting me.

419
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,446
I'm proud of you.

420
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:48,532
No, I'm proud of you.

421
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,785
I just got the chills again.

422
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:57,007
Oh, Max, look at him.

423
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,207
He's smiling.

424
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,334
He likes this place.

425
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,545
Yeah, it's almost worth you
being humiliated on reality TV.

426
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:05,081
Oh, I'll never be on that show.

427
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,590
I didn't sign the release.

428
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:07,718
What?

429
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,888
Old money don't sign.

430
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,806
You're gonna love it here, huh?

431
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,474
Aren't you gonna love it here?

432
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,643
A nice big stable.

433
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:20,063
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

434
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:24,151
Maybe I should come home and
live with my best friend, Max.

435
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,769
What about Caroline?

436
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,529
She can sleep under the tarp.

437
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,907
So I guess you found your weed.

438
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,778
No, this is just something we
do when we're alone together.

439
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,997
It's kind of our thing.

440
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,206
You really love Chestnut, don't you?

441
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:40,717
He's all right.

442
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,420
He's no kitten.

443
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:48,308
Okay, I'll see you soon, Chestnut.

444
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,342
You want a minute alone?

445
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:53,630
I'll be out front.

446
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,486
Hey.

447
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:01,605
This is probably gonna
seem ridiculous to you

448
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,774
because you're a horse
and I'm just some lady

449
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:07,860
that's been slipping you carrots
for the last few months, but...

450
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:11,031
I really got attached to you.

451
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:14,950
This is way more than most
horses get out of me.

452
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:19,206
I wasn't even this upset when
they discontinued tan m&ms.

453
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:24,011
I, um...

454
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:26,346
I really haven't had much
go right for me in my life,

455
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:29,433
and I'm pretty sure things are
gonna keep getting worse but,

456
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,302
you were a good thing.

457
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,720
And when everything sucked,

458
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:36,890
you were the best thing we had going.

459
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:39,475
And you're fuzzy too.

460
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,895
You're so fuzzy, and no one can argue

461
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:45,482
that touching a warm, fuzzy
thing isn't straight up lovely.

462
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:50,186
So, thank you for everything
you did for us, but...

463
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,372
Especially for being fuzzy.

464
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:58,660
Max, are you okay?

465
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:01,163
Yeah, I'm fine, I'll always be fine.

466
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:02,164
Are you crying?

467
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,884
Yeah, I'm crying,

468
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:07,203
'cause I wish I could live here.

469
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,343
Don't worry, we'll come visit,

470
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,313
and we'll find a way
to bring him home in the spring.

471
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,732
Come on.
I have a pocket full of dimes.

472
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:21,351
Let's go get
some convenience store taquitos

473
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,737
and wash 'em down with
blue raspberry wine coolers.

474
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:25,238
They're on sale at the bodega.

475
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,606
Two four packs for five dollars.

476
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:33,497
You know exactly what to say
to cheer a broke sista up.

477
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,915
And when we get home, I found a video

478
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,567
of a kitten singing Bruno Mars.
