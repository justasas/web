1
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:05,118
Max, can you watch my tables
while I run to the restroom?

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,354
I already am.

3
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:07,805
I've been watching model girl

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,491
pretend she's eating for 30 minutes.

5
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:11,693
Oh, she's nice.

6
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:14,596
She always tips
on what she would've eaten.

7
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:17,866
Guess what, everyone?

8
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:19,334
I have a secret.

9
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:20,835
You're a woman trapped in a man's body?

10
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:22,086
No.

11
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,872
You're a man trapped in a woman's body?

12
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:25,423
You're a little boy

13
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,875
trapped in a little girl's body?

14
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:29,260
I am a man in a man's body.

15
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,630
We're not talking about your night life.

16
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,216
I have discovered something when going over

17
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:36,834
the employee applications.

18
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:40,138
Okay, perhaps I never worked
at the Waldorf Astoria,

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,008
but I did work with this guy,
Waldorf, in Astoria.

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,028
It's not you. Tomorrow is Caroline's birthday.

21
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,063
Why wouldn't I know that?

22
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,232
She tells me everything about her life.

23
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:52,650
I know so much about her cycle,

24
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,570
I'm feeling pressure to impregnate her.

25
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:58,323
I can do that for you.

26
00:00:58,325 --> 00:00:59,574
It's weird.

27
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,693
Why wouldn't she want
to celebrate her birthday?

28
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,027
She celebrates everything.

29
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,913
Heads up, everybody.

30
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:06,831
I just refilled the paper towels.

31
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,769
Who's a team player? What, what?

32
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:27,831
Max.

33
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,466
You know what we have to do.

34
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:31,902
Aw, man. I knew this day would come.

35
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,890
All right, what's the least
amount I can do to keep my job?

36
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:39,509
Just tell me when it's over.

37
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:45,849
You have to throw her a party.

38
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:47,350
I'd rather you just

39
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:50,654
have your tiny way with me.

40
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:53,273
I don't like birthdays.
I don't even know when mine is.

41
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:57,527
My mom narrowed it down
to a two-week window in June.

42
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:01,415
But you are Caroline's BFF.

43
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,367
And it is BFF's job
to throw friend a party.

44
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:05,452
Han, I don't have enough money

45
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:06,753
to throw a party.

46
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,989
I don't even have enough money
to throw a baseball.

47
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:11,875
You have money. You be her BFF.

48
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:15,178
I already have a BFF-- Jamarcus.

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,797
And my last birthday,

50
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,216
he threw me a sick surprise party.

51
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:22,135
You must think BFF stands
for "barely freaking friends",

52
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,770
because there's no way you're down

53
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,305
with someone named Jamarcus.

54
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:26,389
Oh, really?

55
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:30,677
Then why did we exchange
ATM pin numbers?

56
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:33,513
Oh...

57
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:36,283
I'll just crop that, and we'll be good to go.

58
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:39,519
Max, Edwin's ready to show us
the design for our new website.

59
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,071
Come see it.

60
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:43,406
Dude, you and the webmaster
have been talking "business"

61
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,024
every day for a week.

62
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:46,243
Is something going on there?

63
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:49,045
Shouldn't the web be mastered by now?

64
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,081
It's strictly business.

65
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,250
All right, but it's costing us $200.

66
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:55,719
Might as well get something out of it.

67
00:02:55,721 --> 00:03:00,373
Maybe let him browse your Yahoo?

68
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,642
Looks like he might have
a big ol' hard drive

69
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:05,529
with a lot of ram.

70
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,515
Yeah, he's cute, but I don't
want a relationship right now.

71
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,150
And I don't do one-night stands.

72
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:12,552
All right, so don't stand. Lay down.

73
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:13,854
That's not me--

74
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:16,055
the next morning,
doing the walk of shame.

75
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:18,942
I always see those girls
with their messed-up sex hair,

76
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,894
carrying their heels,
clutching their coats

77
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,228
to hide last night's outfit.

78
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,564
Going into Kinko's to use Google maps

79
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:27,250
so you can figure out where you are.

80
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:32,622
You really put the "ho" in "Kinko."

81
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,758
Oh. Sorry, Sophie.

82
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,709
We're closed.

83
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:37,177
Oh, no. I'll be quick.

84
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,095
I just want a cupcake to go.

85
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:42,933
I'm on my way to 24 hour fitness.

86
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:48,188
Ja, and I put it on the cupcake
holder on the treadmill.

87
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,860
Uh, Max,
my town car is parked out front

88
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:56,196
and I was wondering
if you wanted me to wait

89
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:58,865
for you and Caroline to give you
a ride back to our building.

90
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,200
Oh, no. It's okay.

91
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:01,484
We still have to clean up
and take the garbage out.

92
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:02,869
Oh.

93
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:12,111
Oh, looks like the garbage
is taking itself out.

94
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:15,248
The game continues.

95
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,550
Here is my number.

96
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:18,084
I invite you to call me

97
00:04:18,086 --> 00:04:20,220
when you realize what a catch I am.

98
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:23,106
Or any time you are drunk and willing.

99
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:26,426
Max, I'm going to need the doggy bag as well.

100
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:28,178
Not for the cupcake.

101
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,431
To puke in.

102
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:36,302
So I'll get this finalized,

103
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,971
and then I'll stop
by the diner tomorrow

104
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:40,657
so you can sign off on
the layout before we go live.

105
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,325
This is so exciting.

106
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:44,477
Oh, wait, Edwin. Shoot.

107
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,363
I forgot to show you
the new pricing chart.

108
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:48,031
It's cool, I can draft it up right now

109
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,315
and upload it when I get home.

110
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,618
Yeah, webmaster. You work pretty fast.

111
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,120
But I bet you can work slow, too.

112
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,373
And really fast again.

113
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,008
I can be done in a minute.

114
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,843
Ooh, not what you want to hear.

115
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,428
Max.

116
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,346
It's fine. We can wait.

117
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,848
You know what? You stay here.

118
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,350
I have to go to the store
and pick up stuff for your--

119
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:08,802
my what?

120
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:13,523
Your cupcake business that
you're making me do with you.

121
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,674
Get home safe.

122
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:16,693
Um, hey, where do you live, Edwin?

123
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:17,811
Hell's kitchen.

124
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:18,979
Oh, cool.

125
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:20,313
You're going to want
to take the "c" down,

126
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:21,982
transfer to the "l,"
and if you get lost,

127
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:24,150
there's a Kinko's on 6th and 14th.

128
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:27,604
That's embarrassing. Max was just trying to--

129
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,689
yeah, I work on complicated web programs.

130
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:32,075
I think I cracked that code.

131
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:33,543
She wants us to hook up.

132
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:35,862
Yeah. I'm sorry.

133
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:37,030
Why are you sorry?

134
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:40,700
That's all I've been thinking about.

135
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:54,731
Yum, yum.

136
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:57,550
Oh, my God.

137
00:05:57,552 --> 00:06:00,103
They are so hot.

138
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:14,017
Don't give me that look.

139
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,863
Oleg.

140
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:28,148
Caroline.

141
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,699
What are you doing here?

142
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:31,401
What are you doing here?

143
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,237
I live here, and I'm just coming out

144
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,855
from going to get coffee.

145
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:38,541
It was delicious.
I drank every bit of it.

146
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,960
Outside. That's why I don't have a cup.

147
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:44,030
But you're wearing
the same outfit from last night.

148
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:46,916
You're wearing the same outfit
from last night.

149
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:49,302
And you have messed-up sex hair.

150
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:51,971
You have messed-up sex hair.

151
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:54,224
Webmaster?

152
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:56,242
Sophie?

153
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:59,345
She called me up and we made hand love.

154
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:01,214
But I thought Sophie hated you.

155
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:05,051
Well, she doesn't hate my hand.

156
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:06,736
But you cannot tell anyone.

157
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:08,271
That was her one condition.

158
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:10,356
That and a copy
of my recent blood tests

159
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,442
signed by a medical professional.

160
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:13,559
Deal.

161
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,245
And you can't tell
anyone about me, either.

162
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:16,162
Especially Max.

163
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:17,614
I'd never hear the end of it.

164
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:18,581
Deal.

165
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,582
Pinky swear?

166
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:20,733
Actually, never mind.

167
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:21,868
I don't know where
your fingers have been.

168
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,538
I just told you where they've been.

169
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,457
Max

170
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:33,279
I'm so excited for this party.

171
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:37,616
I wore my loose clothing
so I can dance all night.

172
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:40,086
God, I cannot take this party pressure.

173
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,120
I'm just going to go in the back

174
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:43,706
and run a can opener across my wrist.

175
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,208
Oh, Max. I'm sure you did a great job.

176
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,711
You know, as long as you have a DJ,

177
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:51,681
some champagne, and a psychic.

178
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:54,500
No, no, and no.

179
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:56,435
I got some balloons, a hummus tray,

180
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:57,770
and possibly Earl.

181
00:07:57,772 --> 00:07:59,922
He still hasn't confirmed.

182
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,006
Oh.

183
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:02,441
You don't need psychic to know

184
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:05,945
that this is going to be
a horrible, horrible party.

185
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:08,230
Well, thank God
Caroline has new boy toy.

186
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:10,182
She might not mind as much.

187
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:11,734
What are you talking about?

188
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:15,071
Yeah, I saw them kissing in
front of the diner last night.

189
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:19,075
Yeah, I sat there
and watched for an hour.

190
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:23,796
They were really going at it,
hot and heavy.

191
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:28,084
You know, like the Showtime
network in the good old days.

192
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:29,201
Oh, great.

193
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:31,003
Now I have to invite him
to the party, too?

194
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:33,222
I only got a six-pack of Capri Suns,

195
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,591
so people are going to have to share.

196
00:08:35,593 --> 00:08:37,643
Congratulations, it's official.

197
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,095
Our website is now live.

198
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:40,980
Congratulations, it's official.

199
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:44,016
You're a whore.

200
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:47,570
I hear you got
your Kinko's card punched.

201
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:48,854
What?

202
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:49,989
Don't "what" me.

203
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:52,742
I know you hooked up
with the webmaster.

204
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,026
Pick up.

205
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:56,228
Oleg, you told Max?

206
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,247
What's happening?

207
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:59,281
Our deal's off.

208
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:01,784
Oleg had sex with Sophie last night.

209
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:03,085
No...

210
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:06,672
It wasn't sex. Just hand stuff.

211
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:08,457
Yeah, and nothing above the waist.

212
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,844
I'm a lady.

213
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:16,465
I got all hot and bothered
watching Caroline and big Han.

214
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:19,969
Okay...

215
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:22,838
You know, I really think
this is between Caroline and me.

216
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,775
You mean between Caroline,
you, and your strippers.

217
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,193
Strippers?

218
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:29,528
I have seen this man in a strip club.

219
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,114
Han, you were in a strip club?

220
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:35,284
Earl took me.

221
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,824
Damn it, Han.

222
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:42,992
You're going to sell me out

223
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:46,962
after I spotted you $100 in ones.

224
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:50,583
You went to Spreaders without me?

225
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:53,502
Why would you take Han to a strip club?

226
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:56,955
Yeah, is his lap even big enough for a dance?

227
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:59,175
Earl, I'm so disappointed in you.

228
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:01,677
That's it. I'm not going to your party.

229
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,728
What party?

230
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,979
Damn it, Earl!

231
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:06,565
It's supposed to be
a surprise for her birthday.

232
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,634
Who told you it was my birthday?

233
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:09,819
Han.

234
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,353
Damn it, Han!

235
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,072
I didn't want a party

236
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:14,907
and I don't want to celebrate
my birthday this year.

237
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,242
Well, too bad,

238
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:19,195
because your BFF is throwing you
a big blow-out.

239
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:21,697
Oh, Max. Now I feel bad.

240
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,534
You feel bad now, wait till you see the party.

241
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:32,291
Caroline's birthday. Woot, woot.

242
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:35,594
Thanks, but you don't have
to say that after everything.

243
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:38,631
Max...

244
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,916
I know you had limited budget,

245
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:43,102
but music is free.

246
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:47,556
Yeah, well, I'm a douche.

247
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:51,110
Speech!

248
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:54,146
Speech!

249
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:57,849
I can't carry this party much longer.

250
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,019
Okay, I'd like to say something.

251
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:02,071
Wait, wait.

252
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,523
Can't we wait till we cut the cake?

253
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:05,857
Cake?

254
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:08,127
People are still doing that?

255
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:12,631
Yes. Our livelihood depends on it.

256
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:15,217
There's only one party as bad as this one.

257
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:20,389
That's the Donner Party.

258
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:26,996
And even they had better food.

259
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:30,516
I'd like to say happy birthday
to a very pretty lady

260
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:32,434
who I just had the pleasure of meeting,

261
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:35,120
and I think I'm going
to be seeing a lot more of her.

262
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:36,488
Aw.

263
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,557
I'll go get us some more drinks.

264
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,891
Okay.

265
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:42,578
Get rid of him.

266
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,029
What?

267
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,197
It was a one-time thing.

268
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:47,249
I thought you weren't that kind of girl.

269
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,900
I realized it had almost been a year

270
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:50,502
since I had sex, and I decided

271
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:52,788
I rather not be that kind of girl.

272
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,039
But I don't want a relationship.

273
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,925
Hey, I get it. Hit it and quit it.

274
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,509
♪ hit it, don't babysit it ♪

275
00:11:57,511 --> 00:12:00,012
Max, please.

276
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:00,963
Fine.

277
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:02,014
How am I going to make him go away?

278
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:03,132
It's not going to take a lot

279
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:05,417
to convince someone
to leave this party.

280
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:09,188
I'd like to ask everyone
to raise their cocktail,

281
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,139
but I can't.

282
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:14,476
So raise your Capri to the sun...

283
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:20,472
For a very special lady who I'm
sure I will be seeing more of.

284
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,293
Get rid of him. It was a one-time thing.

285
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,714
So was that the worst party
you've ever been to?

286
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:39,117
That was the worst party
anyone's ever been to.

287
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,954
So with the webmaster, how was the sex?

288
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:44,723
Pretty good.

289
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:45,891
But then he did that thing

290
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:47,760
where he pretended
he was going to choke me.

291
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:49,645
When did guys start doing that?

292
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:50,596
I don't know,

293
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:51,897
but if I knew that was his thing,

294
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,799
I would've asked him
to choke me at the party.

295
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,234
How did you get rid of him?

296
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:57,269
What did you say?
Did you let him down gently?

297
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:59,355
No, I told him to hit the pike.

298
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:01,440
It's a one-night stand. Guys get that.

299
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:04,109
So that's it? He wasn't upset?

300
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,195
Guys don't care.

301
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,914
One-night stands-- they come, they go.

302
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,981
Literally.

303
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:12,251
But what if he wants to see me again?

304
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:13,285
Relax.

305
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:14,753
It is not going
to come back to haunt you.

306
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,705
Unless you start feeling an itch...

307
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:18,590
Or a kick.

308
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,092
Well, thanks for dumping him.

309
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:21,293
And for the...

310
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:24,213
I'm going to go ahead
and call it a party.

311
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:26,015
I knew you wouldn't want me

312
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:27,683
to use any of the cupcake money,

313
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:28,851
and I was broke.

314
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:30,853
So I guess I am your BFF--

315
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:33,355
your broke friend forever.

316
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:35,641
Max, it really doesn't matter
what you would've done.

317
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:37,393
The only thing
I really wanted for my birthday

318
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,777
was to see my father.

319
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:41,847
And he's in prison,
so that didn't happen.

320
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:45,117
I may not be a good BFF,

321
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,402
I may not throw a great party,

322
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:50,372
but I do know where
to find a free bus to prison.

323
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:53,358
Hey, everybody.
We got a birthday girl onboard.

324
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,462
Sit yo ass back down!

325
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:59,882
See? Now we got a party.

326
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,364
This is nice getting out of the city.

327
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:08,650
Kind of reminds me
of the ride to the Hamptons.

328
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:09,801
Yo.

329
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:12,787
This your first time on the bangbus?

330
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:17,576
We call it the bangbus because
everybody here gonna get banged.

331
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:19,611
And in addition 'cause we're on a bus.

332
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:20,996
Hmm, makes sense.

333
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:21,930
Hey, I'm Shonda.

334
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:24,115
I'm Max. This is Caroline.

335
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:27,285
So you're all going for,
like, conjugal visits?

336
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:28,670
Pretty fancy term for getting

337
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:31,122
shawshanked on a three-legged cot.

338
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:33,508
Shawshanked. I like her.

339
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,476
I like your hair.

340
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:37,128
Did you just get back from Cancun?

341
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,130
No, no.

342
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:41,016
I saved up,
and I got these done for my man.

343
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,017
He says they make me

344
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,652
look like Alicia Keys meets Ed Norton

345
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:45,570
<i>in American History X.</i>

346
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,272
How sweet.

347
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:49,074
Ah, yo. What's your man in for?

348
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:52,444
My man's in for possession
of a sweet, sweet ass.

349
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:55,113
He makes that joke every time.

350
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:57,866
He's not my man, actually. He's my dad.

351
00:14:57,868 --> 00:14:59,117
Oh, so you're a freak.

352
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,136
That's all right. I don't judge.

353
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:04,589
You see a name tag
on me that says "Judy"?

354
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,708
Oh, look. We just passed a Carvel.

355
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,510
What's a Carvel?

356
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:10,495
Carvel ice cream.

357
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:12,180
You know,
Fudgie the Whale, Cookie Puss.

358
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:14,099
Come on, how could you not know Carvel?

359
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:15,350
They have them everywhere.

360
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:16,334
Oh, wait.

361
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:17,769
Is that that white trash ice cream?

362
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:19,104
How dare you!

363
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:21,690
It is not white trash.

364
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:23,141
And I wouldn't be so high and mighty.

365
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,859
You're on a free bangbus to a prison.

366
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:25,944
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:27,195
I didn't realize you had such

368
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:29,364
a strong emotional connection
to ice cream.

369
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:33,818
Not to the ice cream. The ice cream cake.

370
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,121
When I was ten, I asked my mom
for a birthday party.

371
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:37,989
She said yes but then flaked out

372
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,124
and forgot to call anyone.

373
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:40,742
I'm starting to understand why

374
00:15:40,744 --> 00:15:42,544
you don't like birthday parties.

375
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:44,496
So after I waited on the porch for an hour,

376
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,381
I'll stole 20 bucks from her purse,

377
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,532
thumbed it out to Carvel,

378
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,334
and bought myself
a Fudgie the Whale cake.

379
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:52,220
Ate the whole thing
with a pink plastic spoon,

380
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:55,257
and it was way better than
any party ever could have been.

381
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,491
I heard that.

382
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,093
There ain't nothing better
than Fudgie the Whale.

383
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:00,044
I love the chocolate crunchies.

384
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:04,766
Bitch, everybody love
the damn chocolate crunchies!

385
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,738
Hey, Shonda. Who are you here to see?

386
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,906
Who's available?

387
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:16,528
I'm just cracking wise.
You know I'm here to see Squirm.

388
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,029
Search her.

389
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:21,499
Damn. Is it my turn again?

390
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,784
Next.

391
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:25,236
We're not on that list. We didn't call ahead.

392
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:26,738
Leave it to me.

393
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,957
I've gotten into every club
I've ever wanted to get into.

394
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,509
Hi. Caroline Channing plus one.

395
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:33,461
I don't see you on the list.

396
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:35,013
Really? That's weird.

397
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,515
We should be on the list.
We're always on the list.

398
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:38,883
Max, we're not on the list.

399
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:42,887
We're not? I'm going to kill my assistant.

400
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,606
Oh, I know.

401
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:47,726
It might be under Deangelo Jefferson.

402
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,861
Come on, girls. Don't waste my time.

403
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:52,814
I'd like to see a manager.

404
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:56,735
There's no manager.

405
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:58,570
It's a prison.

406
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:01,122
Well, then who runs this place?

407
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:06,578
Well, the Aryan brotherhood
is getting pretty strong.

408
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,797
This is such amateur hour.

409
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,749
Give me 50 bucks for the door guy.

410
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:12,801
Are you seriously trying to bribe

411
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:16,554
an officer of the law
while inside a prison?

412
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:18,640
That's a federal offense.

413
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:19,791
Is it?

414
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:23,428
Probably.

415
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,764
Look, I should have you thrown
out for even suggesting it.

416
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:27,399
We do not accept bribes.

417
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:28,650
Okay, fine.

418
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,902
I'll let you take
your sweet time searching me

419
00:17:30,904 --> 00:17:33,355
on the way in.

420
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:35,573
These two are clear to go through.

421
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:38,193
Max, you can't do that for me.

422
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:40,445
It's really for me. It's been a while.

423
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,615
Woot, woot.

424
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,835
I'm so excited to see my father

425
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:48,203
after all this time.

426
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:49,671
How do I look?

427
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:50,789
You look good. How do I look?

428
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,825
Do I still have
that freshly felt-up glow?

429
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:56,828
Well, that ginger over there
thinks you look good.

430
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,663
He's full-on staring at you.

431
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,598
Well, I should hope so.

432
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,384
If you can't get a dude
in prison to check you out,

433
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,269
it's time for a makeover.

434
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:08,907
No, he's looking
and nodding like he knows you.

435
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:14,195
Never seen him before in my life.

436
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:15,313
Max?

437
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:17,348
Max Black?

438
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,367
It's me, Irish.

439
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,536
I don't know, dude.
I think you got the wrong girl.

440
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:23,788
Max, I could never forget that face.

441
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,876
Trust me, you've never seen me before.

442
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:29,661
Oh, damn!

443
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:31,246
Oh, my God!

444
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:32,914
That's you.

445
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,549
So you do remember.

446
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:36,050
Of course.

447
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:39,053
Get rid of him.
It was a one-night stand.

448
00:18:39,055 --> 00:18:41,038
See, they do come back to haunt you.

449
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,090
Shirt on.

450
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:44,092
Max, can you believe it?

451
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,844
Of all the prisons in all the world,

452
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:47,095
you walked into mine.

453
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,212
It's kismet.

454
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:51,266
I got rid of yours. You get rid of mine.

455
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:54,218
Listen, Irish. It was a one-time thing.

456
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,937
You're a guy. You get that.

457
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,939
How could you say it's a one-time thing?

458
00:18:57,941 --> 00:18:59,107
I love you.

459
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:02,727
I blew up that chipotle for you.

460
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:04,746
Listen, I appreciate the ink,

461
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:06,531
but I don't really believe in love,

462
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:07,565
and truth be told,

463
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,001
I'm not even a fan of Mexican food.

464
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:12,203
Caroline Channing. This table.

465
00:19:12,205 --> 00:19:14,071
Max, we have to go. My dad's coming.

466
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,740
Okay. Nice to see you, Irish.

467
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:17,459
Your body looks sick.

468
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:18,676
Max, hold on.

469
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:19,844
I'm not going to tell you again to back up.

470
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:21,429
Max, I'm not going to lose you twice.

471
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:22,680
I said, back up!

472
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:23,798
Don't tell me to back up.

473
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,266
That's the love of my life.

474
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:27,418
Come on, dude. Hit the pike.

475
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,803
Calm down.

476
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:29,921
Don't tell me to calm down!

477
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:36,528
Visiting hours are over! Everybody out!

478
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,779
No, no, no, wait! I can't leave.

479
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:40,398
Damn!

480
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,933
Oh, wait. There's my father.

481
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:43,368
I can see him, he's just coming in.

482
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,453
Oh, daddy. Daddy...
Hi!

483
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:49,324
Well, thank you very much, ladies.

484
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:52,610
My man was barely in
when I got pulled out.

485
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:56,297
I would like to apologize to everyone

486
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,950
for taking the bang out of the bus,

487
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:00,835
but in my own defense,

488
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:04,121
everyone here knows a little
something about crazy guys.

489
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:06,641
Sit yo ass back down!

490
00:20:06,643 --> 00:20:09,177
Max, sit down before you start another riot.

491
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,795
I'm sorry. I blew it.

492
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:12,597
I screwed up your chance
to see your father.

493
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,848
I screwed up your party.

494
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,467
I even screwed up the
easiest birthday thing to do,

495
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:17,819
like get a cake.

496
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,637
I'm a terrible BFF.

497
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:20,855
It's okay.

498
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,607
Really, it's fine.

499
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:23,975
With the year I'm having,

500
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:25,276
it's not like you could've
made everything better

501
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,028
just by getting me a cake.

502
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,882
Well, no. Not just any cake.

503
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,320
Just as good as I remember it.

504
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,007
Best 40 bucks we ever spent.

505
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,209
And this birthday turned out
to be all right.

506
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:42,544
I did get what I wanted.

507
00:20:42,546 --> 00:20:43,628
I got see my father.

508
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,497
It was only for a second,
but I saw him.

509
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:48,883
And he saw me. So thank you.

510
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:52,103
Yeah, and I got to see Irish.

511
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:54,672
Think he might be
the one that got away.

512
00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:56,774
Well, the one that got put away.

513
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:59,027
You know, you and I are better than BFFs.

514
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,728
We're BBFs.

515
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,532
Bangbus friends.
