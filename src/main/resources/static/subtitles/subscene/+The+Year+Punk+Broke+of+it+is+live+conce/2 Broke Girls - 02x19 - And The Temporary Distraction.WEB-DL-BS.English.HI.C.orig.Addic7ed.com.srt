1
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:07,168
What's up, peanut?

2
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,404
Max, I'm not paying you
to just stand there.

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:11,172
Well, you're not paying me
to eat as many French fries

4
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:12,741
as I can before the plate
leaves the kitchen,

5
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:15,043
but I do that too.

6
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:17,745
Go wait on that pretty girl.

7
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:20,848
Oh, wait.
Is she a boy?

8
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:23,951
She looks a little
like a pretty boy.

9
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:27,922
She's probably looking at you
and thinking the same thing.

10
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:32,560
But are you attracted
to the girl she is

11
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:34,195
or the boy she appears to be?

12
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:36,264
You're confused,
aren't you, Han?

13
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:38,867
Yes, my mind
tells me one thing,

14
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:42,304
but my body tells me
[Deep voice] something else.

15
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:46,141
Max, go on break.
I've got the booth.

16
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:47,909
Oh, no.
You can't wait on her.

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,245
That's Tina, a lesbian
who turns straight girls.

18
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:53,448
I call her
"Tina the Turner."

19
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:55,717
Practically
every heterosexual woman

20
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:57,319
in Williamsburg
has hooked up with her.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,587
Max, everyone?

22
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:03,925
Not me.
Who do you think turned her?

23
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:06,928
But you won't be able
to resist her charm. Trust me.

24
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:10,231
That's nonsense. I'm very
comfortable with my sexuality.

25
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:13,001
I once texted "yes"
to Mr. Chaz Bono

26
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:15,570
on <i>Dancing With The Stars.</i>

27
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:17,072
Okay, good luck.

28
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:19,040
Just don't let me catch you guys
making out on the table.

29
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,141
[Scoffs]

30
00:01:20,142 --> 00:01:23,978
Or do.
It's a free country.

31
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,347
Hi, are you ready to order?

32
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:28,249
Sure. I love your hair,
by the way.

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,120
Earl, Caroline's about
to fall in love with a lesbian.

34
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:36,624
Well, color me
"I saw that one coming."

35
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:38,193
How'd it go?

36
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:39,861
Fine,
she complimented my hair,

37
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:42,197
she ordered a soup,
I gave her my number.

38
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:44,466
I gave her my number?

39
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:46,434
Okay, hit the showers.

40
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:48,269
That's what I get
for sending a straight woman

41
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,839
to do an emotionally dead
woman's job.

46
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,212
It was so nice
to wake up this morning

47
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,564
without the stress
of owning our cupcake business.

48
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,549
The only decision
I have to make today is:

49
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,786
Do I change my underwear
or just turn these inside out?

50
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,789
Four years ago, I was hit
with a similar conundrum:

51
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,225
"Do I buy underwear
or do I buy beer?"

52
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:25,729
I've been free-balling it
ever since.

53
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,798
Max, what are you doing?
What's happening over there?

54
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,366
Oh, you mean the arrow
from the shop?

55
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:33,303
I put it on so you'd know where
the insults were coming from.

56
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:36,306
I'm talking about the cupcakes.
Our cupcake shop is gone.

57
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:38,041
Why are you still
making those things?

58
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,876
It's the only constant
in my life,

59
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:42,412
and the routine distracts me
from the relentless darkness

60
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,248
that lurks in every corner
of my thoughts.

61
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:48,885
Besides, we still need to sell these
at the diner to make extra money.

62
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,921
Well, you can do it.
I'm not speaking to them.

63
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,622
They totally led me on.

64
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,324
Those cupcakes were a tease.

65
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:56,760
Well, I want to pay rent
this month.

66
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,129
And then again next month,
and so on and so on

67
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,798
until the exquisite release
of death.

68
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,402
Oh, rent. Here we go again.
Does that bitch ever stop?

69
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:07,737
[Sighs]
[Phone ringing]

70
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,172
If that's death, it's for me.

71
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:12,943
Tell him to honk
and I'll be right out.

72
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:16,513
Morning, Chestnut.

73
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:19,916
Oh, what is it
about those big, beautiful eyes

74
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:22,285
that makes everything
feel better.

75
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,589
I guess I just have a warmth.

76
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,158
Oh, you mean the horse.

77
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,128
Is this still good?

78
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:33,530
It is not.

79
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:35,665
Eh, like I have a choice.

80
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,268
Wow, that was
a blast from the past--

81
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,203
my old temp agency.

82
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:42,939
Flu's got their staff laid up.
They need bodies.

83
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,175
Wanna do it? I bet
they'll let us temp together.

84
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:48,378
You think? You think
they'd let us temp together?

85
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,280
[Sighs] Oh, God.
Last week,

86
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:52,315
I owned a cupcake business,
now I'm temping.

87
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,652
Why don't I just ask Chestnut
to kick me in the head?

88
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:59,456
He won't do it.
I've asked him like seven times.

89
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:02,459
Look, we've both casually
fantasized about our deaths

90
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,194
within ten minutes
of waking up,

91
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:07,164
so maybe we should do something
to distract us.

92
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,466
And Xeroxing
will make us feel whole?

93
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:13,036
Let me tell you something.

94
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:17,007
When you're photocopying
your ass on a Xerox machine,

95
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:20,143
you are never more alive.

96
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:22,646
Hello, old friend.

97
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,382
Here it is, my temping blazer.

98
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:28,885
Ahh, you can still smell
the "No way out."

99
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,654
Why is that in a bucket?

100
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:33,523
'Cause I don't want
to accidentally wear it.

101
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,060
Well, is there a pantsuit
in the oven I could wear?

102
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,696
It doesn't matter
what you wear--you're a temp.

103
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,666
They'll be impressed
if you don't poop your pants.

104
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:47,003
And even if you do,
not a deal breaker.

105
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,572
[Knock at door]

106
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:50,040
All right, I'll go,

107
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,374
but if we're temping
to make our rent,

108
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,276
that's the last batch
of those.

109
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:56,880
I don't want to see, hear, or
think any more about cupcakes.

110
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,782
[Laughs]

111
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:02,352
Ding dong,
the cupcake's calling.

112
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:04,521
[Laughs]

113
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,623
We found the cupcake costumes
from your store

114
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:09,526
out near the dumpster.
[Laughs]

115
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:10,894
Are you guys drunk?

116
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,696
Yes!
[Laughs]

117
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:16,266
Yeah, we've been out clubbing
all night. [Laughs]

118
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:19,736
[Coughs] Oh, I just swallowed
one of my balls.

119
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,972
Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,475
Well, now, you know
how I feel. [Laughs]

121
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:28,445
I threw those costumes away
on purpose.

122
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:30,580
Max and I are no longer
making cupcakes.

123
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,050
What'd you say?

124
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,820
Cupcakes are a waste
of time and money.

125
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,090
You take that back right now!

126
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,725
No, you don't--

127
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,627
You're lucky

128
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:46,796
that I have a giant cake
holding me back right now.

129
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:49,499
[Laughs]

130
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:56,072
Fifth floor, end of dreams.

131
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:58,174
Oh, yeah,
I worked here before.

132
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,076
You know the toaster oven
in our kitchen?

133
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:03,079
It came from here.

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,650
Hi. Caroline Channing,
reporting for my first day.

135
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,418
I went ahead
and printed out my address,

136
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,688
Social Security number, and other important
information to make your life easier.

137
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:14,291
Hey, I'm temp number two.
Where your bathroom at?

138
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,660
I'll get Eli.
He's my boss.

139
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,695
Sign these stating that
if you're injured on the job,

140
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:20,163
it's not our fault.

141
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:22,632
How would we injure ourselves
in an office?

142
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,169
Let me just give you
a "for instance."

143
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,305
Some girl, let's say
her name is Sarah,

144
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,673
is walking through the office

145
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:31,941
with her number 2 pencil
facing up-ways.

146
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:33,843
Well, she trips
over her shoes and falls,

147
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,812
and that number 2 pencil
goes right through her eyeball

148
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,714
and into her brain.

149
00:06:37,715 --> 00:06:41,518
And now she's gotta eat applesauce
through a straw the rest of her life.

150
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,622
See, that's not our fault, that's her
fault, as per the judge's decision

151
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,357
in Sarah Drake vs.
Westship insurance.

152
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,659
Sign those.
I'll get Eli.

153
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,329
Thank you. I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

154
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,899
That's 'cause
I didn't give it to you.

155
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,035
What are you doing? You never
give anybody your real name.

156
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:01,304
That way, when you make
your little data entry mistake,

157
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,406
they can't
track the real you down.

158
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:06,676
You didn't see me
at the Enron trial, did you?

159
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,746
And that light in your eyes?
Dim it down, way down.

160
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:10,980
Show me.

161
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:15,652
Wow. That's actually
really good. How'd you do that?

162
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:18,488
- I thought about our future.
- Great!

163
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:20,090
Eli's in a meeting,

164
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,525
but you gotta watch
this sexual harassment video.

165
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,494
Watching a video
seems like a waste of time

166
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,529
when we could be doing
something more productive.

167
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,834
A waste of time? Let me
just give you a "for instance."

168
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,369
There's this Dominican guy,

169
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,371
he's installing a new water jug
in the office,

170
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:37,006
and he looks at one of
the female employees and says,

171
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:40,510
"Speaking of jugs,"
and then he reaches up

172
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,846
and cups
the employee's breastesses

173
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,449
then starts twisting
on the nips and what have you.

174
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,918
Now, how do you handle
a situation like that?

175
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,921
That's actually how
my longest relationship started.

176
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:53,423
[Chuckles]

177
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,093
[On TV] I'd love to give you
that promotion, Beverly,

178
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:59,596
but first, you'll have
to do something... for me.

179
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,931
Don't do it, Beverly!
Don't do it!

180
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:04,734
Spoiler alert. I've watched this
in here before,

181
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,970
and it does not end well
for Beverly.

182
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:08,638
Well, not to blame the victim,

183
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,207
but who wears a black bra
to work?

184
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,776
These shelves
would be so much better

185
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:14,944
if they were alphabetized
and color-coordinated.

186
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:17,814
Forget that cabinet and look
at the top shelf on Beverly.

187
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:19,816
I'm a little jelly.

188
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,418
[On TV] That's right, Beverly.

189
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,720
Now, bend down
and pick up that file.

190
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,822
Oh, Doug,
you're up to your old tricks,

191
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:28,491
and she falls for it
every time.

192
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:30,460
Let's pause here
and write down these rules

193
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,295
we've learned
from Beverly and Doug.

194
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:34,964
Oh, I love the smell in here.

195
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:37,000
Reminds me of interning
on Wall Street,

196
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,936
you know, minus the dignity
and the future.

197
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,772
But why would the paper products
be near the toner cartridges?

198
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,073
Whoever organized this place

199
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:46,075
must have been stupid
or lazy or both.

200
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:48,144
Aboth.

201
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,813
Forget all that shelf stuff.

202
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:51,781
You are not here
to improve office layout,

203
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,783
you're here to keep quiet,
pretend like you're working,

204
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,351
and steal
five to ten vitamin waters

205
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:58,254
from the break room
at the end of each day.

206
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:01,257
Hey.

207
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:05,195
Are you watching dirty videos
in here and didn't invite me?

208
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:08,431
They're making
harassment videos in 3-D now?

209
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:10,099
I was looking
for the new temps,

210
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,035
but I think I wandered
into a beauty pageant.

211
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:14,704
Uh, the votes are in.
It's a tie.

212
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:16,639
I'm Eli Green,
the office manager.

213
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,707
You must be our new temps.

214
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,975
I'm Caroline Channing.

215
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,811
And I'm Carmen... Sandiego.

216
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,713
No relation.

217
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:28,605
[Cat meows]
[Laughs]

218
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:30,340
Oh, my God, this is great!

219
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,742
The cat's
eating the dog's food.

220
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:35,678
The dog's just like,
"Wha-a-at?"

221
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,849
Yo, psst. "Cat eats dog food."
YouTube it now.

222
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,784
Kinda busy with my work.

223
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,619
It's called "Minimum Wage"

224
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,856
'cause you're supposed to do
the minimum.

225
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:49,058
Mmm. Coffee tastes
so much better

226
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,194
when it's from today
and you haven't paid for it.

227
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:52,628
[Cat meows]

228
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,464
[Laughs]
The dog's just like, "Wha-a-at""

229
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,066
classic.

230
00:09:57,067 --> 00:10:00,036
You like that video?
Look up "Cat vs. Toddler."

231
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:03,406
You're welcome.

232
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this a modeling agency?

233
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:08,644
Did I get off
on the wrong floor?

234
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:13,816
I don't care where you get off
as long as it's not here.

235
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:17,119
Hi, Eli. So any idea
when they'll decide

236
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,322
who's getting the junior
executive promotion, or--

237
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,324
Not yet, but I did
just mention your name

238
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,092
- to the big guys, Ryan.
- I'm Leon.

239
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:25,595
Hey, Caroline.

240
00:10:25,596 --> 00:10:26,963
Hi. Question:
I already finished

241
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:28,497
the first quarter
claim reports...

242
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:31,801
Are you doping?
We need to stretch this out.

243
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,569
And since I had time,
I took the liberty

244
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,404
of reformatting
the expense template,

245
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:37,240
so what would you like me
to do now, Eli?

246
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:40,476
Say my name, say my name.

247
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:42,578
Hey, Caroline,
you're not just hot,

248
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,414
you're on fire over there.
You should be throwing your hat

249
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:46,749
in the ring
for that executive job.

250
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,251
Really?

251
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:52,388
And this girl's just like,
"Wha-a-at?"

252
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,194
That temp place
is soul-sucking,

253
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:01,097
and I didn't even know
I had a soul to suck.

254
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:04,767
If that's a suicide note,
just add my name to the end.

255
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,435
Come on, it's not that bad,

256
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:09,138
and I got four free
fresh coffee drinks,

257
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,474
and one had a caramel drizzle.

258
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,109
Caramel drizzle?

259
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,778
That's definitely my name
at my next temp job.

260
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,813
I don't know
if this is such a temp job.

261
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:19,315
I'm filling out
this application

262
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,183
to apply for that
junior executive position.

263
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,019
Oh, no, you're not.

264
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,553
We're only going back
one more time

265
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:25,821
to get enough Wite-Out

266
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:28,891
to do the Kim Kardashian
white manicure.

267
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:32,028
Max, you saw me there today.
I'm good at this,

268
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,063
and it felt amazing
to be working somewhere

269
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:36,499
where my skills are valued
and supported.

270
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,001
Oh! Are you not feeling
supported here?

271
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:43,406
I'm sorry,
I'm a boss, not a bra.

272
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,541
Should I praise you more?
Really killing it

273
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:48,811
with the leaning on the counter
doing nothing.

274
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:52,915
Kudos, Caroline.
Huzzah.

275
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,583
Hey, where's my "huzzah"?

276
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:56,485
I was standing around
doing nothing too.

277
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:57,887
And don't forget about me.

278
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:01,090
I was sitting around
doing nothing.

279
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:03,693
In Korea, you all would be
left on the curb

280
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:05,695
and taken away
with the garbage.

281
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:09,665
Is that how
you got to America, Han?

282
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:12,702
Earl, Caroline's
being an idiot.

283
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:17,106
Oh, are we doing this
in front of her now?

284
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:18,908
Hey, would you still
apply for that job

285
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:21,711
if I told you we sold out of
the cupcakes tonight?

286
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:23,112
Last one.

287
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,914
Oh, so what,
they're good one day

288
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:26,349
and you want me
to take them back?

289
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,018
Who am I, Robert Pattinson?

290
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:32,088
So you just cut lil' coconut
here out of your life?

291
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:33,723
That's cold.

292
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:36,459
Max, this job
offers medical benefits.

293
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,195
There are doctors
who don't have medical benefits.

294
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:41,697
And financial security.
Maybe I want to wake up

295
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:43,866
every morning
not wanting to kill myself.

296
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:46,869
Well, that's weird,
but whatever.

297
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:52,808
I went to Wharton.

298
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,310
Pay attention, everyone.

299
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,945
I know you're all
very busy working hard--

300
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:57,813
[Cat meows]
[On computer] <i>Congratulations,</i>

301
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:59,949
- <i>you've just won a free iPad.</i>
- What the-I don't know--

302
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,949
[Clears throat]

303
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,485
Attention, everyone!

304
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:05,121
While doing work
and nothing but work,

305
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:07,490
I may have downloaded
a virus that meows,

306
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:10,426
so be on the lookout.

307
00:13:10,427 --> 00:13:12,161
Carry on, Eli.

308
00:13:12,162 --> 00:13:14,897
Thank you, Carmen.

309
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:16,899
Happy to say, tenth floor

310
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,401
has finally picked
our new junior exec,

311
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:20,002
and that person
is sitting right here.

312
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:21,804
- Yes!
- No, Caroline.

313
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,406
- Yes!
- No!

314
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:24,407
Champagne on me!

315
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:26,509
Yes!

316
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:33,120
Here, I got us a fresh bottle,
'cause I'm the boss.

317
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,105
Miss Black,
would you pop that cork for me?

318
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,374
I'd be happy to,
Miss Channing, you bitch.

319
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,910
Ooh!
[Laughs]

320
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:43,080
Okay.

321
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,816
Okay, okay, now
I'm gonna make a proper toast.

322
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,418
I don't know how.

323
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,386
Their toaster oven's
in our kitchen.

324
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:52,122
To Max--I promise
not to sexually harass you

325
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,725
no matter how much I'm
required to as your superior.

326
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:57,394
To Caroline--
I cannot promise the same thing,

327
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:00,898
'cause sister, you fine.
[Laughs]

328
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,401
Oh, crap! I spilled champagne
on my good bucket blazer.

329
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:08,572
[Low voice] Yes, right there
on your breasts, Beverly.

330
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:10,908
I'm doing Doug from
the sexual harassment video.

331
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,577
<i>The</i> Doug?
Love your harassment work!

332
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,147
Especially that sad H.R. scene
where you get fired and cry

333
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,251
but still manage
to touch yourself a little.

334
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:22,453
[Low voice] Wow, Beverly,

335
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:24,822
your breasts are so big,
I might need the whole box.

336
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,824
[Laughs]

337
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,860
That's enough. You're making
this rag feel even dirtier.

338
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,462
- Hey, hand me that.
- What?

339
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,597
- My new Westship Company poncho?
- Yep.

340
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:36,200
Now it's my booze bib.

341
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,102
Oh, I love this.

342
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:40,871
Somehow it's small enough
to fit in your purse,

343
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,439
but large enough
to sleep under

344
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,141
during an
"Occupy Wall Street" -type situation.

345
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:46,043
[Laughs]

346
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:48,379
Max, I'm pouring you
more champagne

347
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,647
because I have something

348
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:51,615
really exciting
I want to tell you.

349
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,818
I talked to Eli
about hiring you full-time.

350
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:57,821
You are now a junior executive's
executive assistant!

351
00:14:58,322 --> 00:15:02,359
I will knock you
to the ground!

352
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,963
Max, think about it.
It comes with health care.

353
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:08,332
You wouldn't have to decide
between birth control pills

354
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,701
and morning-after pills.

355
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:14,705
Are you trying to take away
a woman's right to choose?

356
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,075
Come on, it could be so fun.

357
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:20,177
Coming to work together,
getting free coffee--

358
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:22,479
the good kind,
the blended kind--

359
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,149
not to mention
Xeroxing our asses

360
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,817
and feeling more alive
than ever.

361
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:28,686
Watch, I'll show you
what a fun boss I can be.

362
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,689
Let's Xerox our asses.

363
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,558
Well, how could I say no
to copying my butt?

364
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,659
The only thing better
than one of my butts

365
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,728
is two of my butts.

366
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,998
- I'll go first.
- Too late!

367
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,867
Do you want legal size paper
or three-hole punch?

368
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:47,905
Three-hole punch? That's how
my longest relationship ended.

369
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,609
Ready, you corporate sell-out.
Fry me.

370
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,081
Hey, why is it still flashing?

371
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:00,217
Whoops! I put in 100 copies
instead of one.

372
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:03,554
Don't worry about it, we'll
use them as Christmas cards.

373
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,690
See? That's why
I need an assistant.

374
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:09,760
Thanks, but I'm not gonna take
this stupid corporate job.

375
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,896
I'm gonna stick with cupcakes,
even though you just quit.

376
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,532
I didn't quit
the cupcake business.

377
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,401
If you remember, it quit us.

378
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:18,769
At least this job makes sense.

379
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,105
You get a regular paycheck,
benefits.

380
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,906
You don't spend
two whole years of your life

381
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:24,308
giving it everything,

382
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:25,909
and then walk away
feeling like a failure.

383
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,645
Get off that now.
I'm worried

384
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:28,979
you're giving yourself
butt cancer.

385
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,150
Wait,
you think you're a failure?

386
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:34,918
'Cause I think we did amazing.

387
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,222
The shop closed, Max.
Our dream blew up in our face.

388
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:40,491
Lots of things
blow up in your face.

389
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:44,161
It's part of being a woman.

390
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:50,601
You just...
Towel off and keep going.

391
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:52,169
You're really
going to do this?

392
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,171
This was just supposed to be
a temporary distraction

393
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:55,806
till we got back
to the cupcake thing.

394
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,275
No, Max.
Cupcakes were the temp job.

395
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:00,244
No, cupcakes were our dream.

396
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:01,745
Well, I was wrong.

397
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:05,416
Maybe it's better
not to have a dream.

398
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,485
Good morning, everyone.

399
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,287
Eli, they said
you wanted to see me in here?

400
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:12,956
Ms. Channing, my name
is Michelle Yi, I'm with H.R.

401
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,859
Aw! Is this
my official welcome?

402
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,961
[British accent]
Oh, hello. [Laughs]

403
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,430
Well, here, I brought

404
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:21,165
some first-day bagels
and plain cream cheese.

405
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,134
Sometimes chives can be
a little breathy, am I right?

406
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:26,904
Is this the woman
who sexually harassed you?

407
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,808
Yup, that's her.

408
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,978
[Laughs] Oh, good one!
Really funny.

409
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,346
Me harassing you?

410
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,515
Come on,
you're not even my type.

411
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,651
Caroline, this isn't a joke.

412
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:43,153
Trust me, I've been through
four of these.

413
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:44,888
Wait, what's going on?

414
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,458
Ms. Channing, please
don't address Carmen directly.

415
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:49,326
- Max.
- "Max"?

416
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:51,795
Is that a pet name
she has for you, Carmen?

417
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:57,568
Yes. She also calls me
"Caramel Drizzle."

418
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,670
Can you tell me
what exactly happened

419
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,305
with Ms. Channing
last night?

420
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,907
She fondled my breasts.

421
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:06,143
Ms. Yi,
it's not how it sounds.

422
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:08,879
We were drinking, and I was
pretending to be a man.

423
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,748
"Drinking."
"Pretending to be a man."

424
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:13,016
Don't write that down.
Don't write that down.

425
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:14,752
And Carmen,
when Ms. Channing touched you,

426
00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:16,153
how did that make you feel?

427
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:18,055
Dirty.

428
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,324
Dirty and underpaid.

429
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:22,092
She felt dirty?

430
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:23,894
Come on, Ms. Yi,
you don't know her.

431
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:27,765
She's the dirty girl.
She is a dirty, dirty girl.

432
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:29,867
And does that turn you on?

433
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:33,504
No! It's almost impossible
to turn me on.

434
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:36,707
Oh, good.
Now I don't feel so bad.

435
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,009
Trust me,
she's making this stuff up.

436
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,544
I'm sorry, Ms. Channing.

437
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,913
We're gonna have to terminate
your employment.

438
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:47,017
This is outrageous!
Nothing she said ever happened.

439
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:50,721
Then how do you explain this?

440
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:52,956
That is a copy
from a Xerox machine

441
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,892
badly in need of toner,
which is just one

442
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:57,094
of the many oversights
that would not have continued

443
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,798
had I been made
an executive here. Good day.

444
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,736
I don't know
what she's talking about.

445
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:07,271
That butt
couldn't be any toner.

446
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,540
Write that down,
write that down.

447
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,476
Can I get a peek at that?

448
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:20,584
How are you tonight, Caroline?

449
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:22,820
Angry, frustrated, humiliated.

450
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:26,190
Just another Tuesday
at the diner.

451
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:29,059
Hello, Carmen.
Or is it "Caramel Drizzle?"

452
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,094
Just so you know,

453
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:33,931
that stunt will go
on my professional work record.

454
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:35,332
Oh, please.
This diner's

455
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,734
on your professional
work record.

456
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:40,771
And your record's clean.
Eli expunged it

457
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:44,174
because I gave him
a couple of my ass Xeroxes.

458
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:46,176
He's laminating them
and using them as place mats.

459
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:47,878
My idea.

460
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:50,747
For what, Max?
Why'd you get me fired?

461
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,749
Why'd I get you fired?

462
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,954
Well, let me give you
a "for instance."

463
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:59,890
I once knew this girl
who was so used to not failing

464
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:01,425
that the first time she did,

465
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,594
she got so scared,
she forgot who she was

466
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:05,062
and tried to be somebody else,

467
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:07,865
and then she touched
my breastesses.

468
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,800
Look, it's cool if you don't

469
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,368
want to join in
on the cupcake dream,

470
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,403
but at least wait
till you find another.

471
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:15,472
Don't hop on the first one
that comes along.

472
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:18,041
It's a dream, not a man.

473
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,310
See?
You are a dirty girl.

474
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:23,480
I'm a dirty, dirty girl.
[Both laugh]

475
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:27,484
Hey, cupcake quitters.

476
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,420
Look, do you see
what you've driven me to?

477
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,823
Supermarket cakes.

478
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:35,959
Sophie, you don't need
to eat those.

479
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,461
You can have one of ours.

480
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:41,131
Max's Homemade Cupcakes
is back in business.

481
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:46,970
It would be cruel to kid me.

482
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:50,107
Nope. We're doing it
differently this time.

483
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:51,909
We are? How?

484
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,443
I have no idea.

485
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:55,312
But for starters,

486
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:57,948
you're my new junior executive
executive's assistant.

487
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:02,586
I will knock you
to the ground.

488
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:06,657
Mmm. Ohh. Yeah.

489
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:09,426
Well, Mama happy now.

490
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:13,534
