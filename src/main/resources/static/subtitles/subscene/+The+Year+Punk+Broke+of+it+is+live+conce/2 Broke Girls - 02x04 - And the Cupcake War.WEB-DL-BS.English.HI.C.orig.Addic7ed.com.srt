1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,036
Look at all these customers
from the Brooklyn midnight ride.

2
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:07,931
I smell diner success!

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:12,719
Really? 'Cause I smell baked crotch.

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,854
Can balls fart?

5
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:17,658
Because I feel like I'm smelling that too.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,092
Where is Oleg with my orders?

7
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:20,811
If my tables don't get
food soon, they're gonna...

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,896
Oh, my God, they're raising their arms.

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,865
Ugh! Well, we know it wasn't a charity ride

10
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:26,366
to raise money for deodorant.

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,969
[Bell dinging] Oleg, where are my burgers?

12
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:32,205
I'm a little in the weeds right now.

13
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:34,608
You mean you smoked a
little weed right now?

14
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,243
It's medicinal.

15
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,179
Helps with my chronic erection.

16
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:41,498
Can someone who's not in the grateful dead

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,217
tell me how we're gonna get food?

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,336
Follow me.

19
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,005
You do plates, buns, coleslaw.

20
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,122
I'll do burgers, fries,

21
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:52,225
and any guy who has no future.

22
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:54,728
Can you imagine if we
were born inside shells,

23
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,799
and then even bigger animals
cracked us open to eat?

24
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,984
Fries on the plates!

25
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,637
Is anybody writing this gold down?

[Slap]

27
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:08,025
All right, Oleg. I want in.

28
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,910
Where's the...

29
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:11,578

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,516

Oh, my God, am I deaf?

32
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,157
Wait, where is it?

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,010
I put it somewhere.

34
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:37,771

Hey. I don't know where you guys are

40
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,081
in your bike training.
Are we doping or deserting?

41
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,833
I can help you either way.

42
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,051
We're thinking about dessert.

43
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,720
Cool, how about a Max's Homemade Cupcake?

44
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,138
Eh, I don't think so.

Nice. The family of mice that lives in it

47
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,845
just renewed their lease.

48
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,981
So, a Max's Homemade Cupcake?

49
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:15,049
You keep saying "Max's Homemade Cupcakes"

50
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,234
like it's a thing.

51
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,302
I've never heard of it.

52
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,720
I haven't either. And we know a lot.

53
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:25,660
And yet you put that
headband on this morning.

54
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:27,495
- So who's Max?
- Yeah, who's Max?

55
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,063
Who's Max?

56
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:34,335
She's Lance Armstrong's left nut.

57
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:40,842
- What?
- Nothing.

58
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:43,995
Caroline,

59
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,764
you know I'm not one to gossip,

60
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,249
but just about 30 seconds ago,

61
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,251
I saw Max drop some major attitude

62
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,753
and blow a chance with a
possible cupcake customer.

63
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,389
That's your gossip?

64
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,557
That Max has an attitude?

65
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,427
What are you gonna tell me
next, that Elton John is gay?

66
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,030
Anyways, I'm just saying about Max,

67
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:06,651
bitch needs to take it down a notch.

68
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:11,873
Bitch needs to mind his own business.

69
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:16,160
Max, did you blow a possible
cupcake customer tonight?

70
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:21,833
You know I don't mix
business with pleasure.

71
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,784
We have to keep pushing our cupcakes.

72
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,721
Every table, every time,
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes."

73
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:27,805
I did.

74
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,457
I said my name to that table more times

75
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,859
than my mother said it my entire life.

76
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,511
But you can't just say the name.

77
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,962
You have to really sell it. [Scoffs]

78
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,397
You should see me out there.

They're moist, delicious, creamy..."

82
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:42,770
Stop.

83
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:46,691
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but I am not a whore.

84
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,443
Oh, you're a cupcake whore,

85
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:51,979
and right now I'm your pimp, so...

86
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,164
How many did you sell tonight?

87
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,867
Two. Don't hit me, daddy!

88
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,335
[Laughter]

89
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,637
Okay, how many did you sell tonight?

90
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,656
I sold... two.

91
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:03,791
[Sighs]

92
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,443
Okay, we're bad whores.

93
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,762
No, we are tired whores.

94
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:09,047
It's not the end of the world.

95
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,466
We're just letting a
few El Caminos drive by

96
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:15,303
because our wrists are sore.

97
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,437
I love you for that.

98
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,557
You just put everything into perspective.

99
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,593
So I says to Caroline,
"it's so bad for business."

100
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,929
And right now they're in the
kitchen having huge fight.

101
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:30,101
I really worried that...

102
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,788
Lady Chatterbox says your
business is in big trouble.

103
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,876
Please, everything seems big to Han.

104
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,245
Ready to go, Sophie?

105
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,414
And girls, sorry to hear
your business broke up

106
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,085
and you aren't speaking.

107
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:49,887
We scared him.

108
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,091
Now he's gonna run under the stove.

109
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,393
I'm gonna make some calls to help you.

110
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,145
Get you some big party jobs.

111
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:59,180
That's so nice of you, Sophie.

112
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,515
We really appreciate it.

113
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,817
You girls can make some big money.

114
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,854
As you know, Duza Day is coming up.

115
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:11,058
Um, no, I do not know.

116
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,777
What the hell is Duza Day?

117
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,532
Oh, Duza Day is huge
holiday in Polish community.

118
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,234
When a Polish girl reaches six feet,

119
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,287
you give her big party.

120
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,508
I had mine when I was seven.

121
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:32,180
[Laughs]

122
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:33,364
Is this private giggling

123
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,183
or can anyone join?

124
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,185
[Laughs]

125
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:39,887

00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,725
Already watched it.

129
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,145
They fought about a necklace. [Laughs]

133
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,768
to finally open up our own storefront.

134
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,321
Wait, $10,000? What kind of show is this?

135
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,040
I thought Google eliminated the need

136
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,626
to ask questions out loud, but fine.

137
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,827
It's a show on food network

138
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,729
where teams make cupcakes
and compete for money.

139
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,714
And why are we not on it?

140
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:07,882
[Chuckles]

141
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,217
Look at that dumb-dumb!

142
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,118
She just dropped the pastry bag.

143
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,170
Hey, they're called hands,

144
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,222
learn how to use them, dumb-dumb!

145
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:15,623
[Snickers]

146
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,458
And that is why we're not on it.

147
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,677
Not everyone's as judgmental as you.

148
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,762
Oh, everyone's as judgmental as me.

149
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,397
And I don't need some snarky bitch

150
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,132
pointing at us on her TV going,

151
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,300
"oh, look at that blonde dumb-dumb

152
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,736
and her hot friend trying to do something."

153
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:31,606
Max, why don't you ever let yourself dream?

154
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:32,990
Because in my dreams,

155
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,359
spiders are always eating my eyes.

156
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,228
This might be the big push we need.

157
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,830
<i>We can go on Cupcake Wars,</i>

158
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,032
or we can keep being cupcake whores.

159
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,200
Think about it.

160
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,651
We wouldn't have to
go car-to-car anymore,

161
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,620
we could actually open a brothel.

162
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,205
Wait, if brothel's on the table,

163
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,207
why don't we just forget
about this cupcake thing?

164
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,425
'Cause that's a job I can do without pants.

165
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:53,160
Seriously. Let's at least go to

166
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,278
the food network and apply.

167
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,763
That's not how it works.

168
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:57,098
You fill out an application online,

169
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,332
submit a two-minute home video,

170
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,451
and then wait eight to
ten days for a response.

171
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,753
Huh, caught you dreaming.

172
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,507
All right, so maybe I thought
about it for, like, a second,

173
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,708
when we first became a team.

174
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,727
But then I remembered
the world's a dead-end

175
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,312
and nothing good happens ever to anyone.

176
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,446
There's a gun in that drawer.

177
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:14,699
Do you want to just kill ourselves?

178
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,734
Oh, Max.

179
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,403
You finally called us a team.

180
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,072
We are so going on that show.

181
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,824
Seriously, I don't know
how Abby and Brittany do it,

182
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:24,992
because I'm uncomfortable with you

183
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:27,861
even sitting this close to me.

184
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:35,938
Well, if we're making an audition tape

185
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,140
to be on a reality show called,

186
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:38,925
"the world's most uncomfortable T-shirt,"

187
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:40,843
we have already won.

188
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:43,963
Yes, I could have gotten
us a more expensive shirt

189
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,882
at American Apparel, but then we would

190
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:48,017
just look like people
pretending to be poor.

191
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,055
And 13, and probably in the sex trade.

192
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:53,523
I cannot believe you used your flat iron

193
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:54,941
to put these letters on.

194
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,610
Well, I can't believe you
once used it to make a panini,

195
00:07:57,612 --> 00:08:00,697
but... [scoffs] that's what happens now.

196
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,815
Where's the scissors?
I gotta give this thing

197
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:05,518
- some flave.
- Max, what are you doing?

198
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,405
Crew necks are for squares and mormons.

199
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:13,092
Oh, cute! Should we do mine?

200
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:14,544
I don't know.

201
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:18,948
If you have no car, why open the garage?

202
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,417
[Laughter]

203
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,586
So, I thought we'd shoot it over here

204
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:26,839
in our adorable, scrappy,
low-income kitchen.

205
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,541
Why are you talking like that?

206
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,343
Because that's our brand.

207
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:31,928
<i>I've watched a ton of Cupcake Wars,</i>

208
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,096
and it's a lot about branding.

209
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:34,313
And what are we?

210
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:35,682
The girl who knows how to make cupcakes

211
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,767
and the girl who doesn't?

212
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,552
Max, I'm not worried about that.

213
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:41,387
You'll just tell me what
to do, like you always do,

214
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:44,223
and we'll be the two
scrappy girls with so little

215
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,608
you can't help but love them.

216
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,860
I hate them already.

217
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,011
[Knock at door]

218
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:50,446
Okay, that's Oleg.

219
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,365
You did tell him he's
filming us for an audition

220
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,850
and not making a porno, right?

221
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:57,870
Yeah, I made it very clear.

222
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,906
Why are your tops still on?

223
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:02,458
And why isn't the plastic down?

224
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,827
You're gonna get oil everywhere.

225
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:07,680
Oleg, Max told you we're not
gonna make that kind of movie.

226
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:10,082
I know, but so did every
girl that I worked with

227
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,901
on "Backdoor Brides."

228
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:14,520
And then again on "Backdoor Brides Two."

229
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:18,641
But five minutes later, it
was "Here comes the bride."

230
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:20,393
Oh, good.

231
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,196
You still have your tops on.

232
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:24,781
Yeah, they don't have to make

233
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:26,599
girl-on-girl porn film for money.

234
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,284
I got you big Duza Day party.

235
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:30,119
300 cupcakes!

236
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:32,455
Oh, my God! That's $1,200.

237
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:35,541
No, it's for free.

238
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,126
You do it for connections,

239
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:39,962
and for the hot and cold pierogi buffet.

240
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:41,497
Oh, Sophie, I don't know
if we should be taking

241
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,749
free work right now.

242
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,133
We're doing this TV
thing, and if we get it,

243
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:45,918
we don't know what our schedule will be.

244
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,207
Oh, I didn't know I was
talking to Cagney and Lacey.

245
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,010
Yeah, well, suit yourself.

246
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,511
We're sorry, Sophie.

247
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,047
You have every right to be mad.

248
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:00,266
Would a cupcake help?

249
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:02,485
Always.

250
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:06,272
Well, I just texted the
third girl not to come,

251
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:09,592
so let's get this over with.

252
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:11,661
This is so exciting. We're gonna be great.

253
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:13,796
- We got this, girl.
- Okay, stop.

254
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:16,365
On every reality show,
people say lame things

255
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,583
that we can never say.

256
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:19,585
No fist bumping. No high fives.

257
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:21,987
You can't tell me to
"bring it," "shut it down,"

258
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,956
or "put our cupcake business on the map."

259
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,659
You can't tell me to "go,
girl"" or "bring my 'a' game,"

260
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:28,427
and we don't "got this." Cool?

261
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,545
Cool.

262
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:33,800
- But we do got this, right?
- Yeah, we got this.

263
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,535
Okay, here we go, girls.

264
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:40,139
Arch your backs. Sorry, force of habit.

265
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,224
Action.

266
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,892
Hey, what's up? I'm Max,

267
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:44,610
and this is my partner, Caroline.

268
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:46,646
And we're Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

269
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:51,184
And by homemade, I mean, "Ho!-Made."

270
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:53,820
[Laughs] You go, girl!

271
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,959
- We are an online bakery...
- Well, we have a website.

272
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,495
And we're based right here
in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

273
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:04,580
And this is where the magic happens.

274
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:07,333
This is our kitchen-slash-
living room-slash-my bedroom...

275
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:09,535
Slash my wrists, 'cause
I'm trying to bake all night

276
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:11,988
while she's sleeping over there.

277
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,173
And here is our purple stove.

278
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,374
Just because you're poor,

279
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,343
that doesn't mean you can't have style.

280
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:19,812
Or a horse that just came in unannounced.

281
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,597
Oh, this is Chestnut.

282
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,099
He's our test audience.

283
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:24,400
But we don't feed him chocolate.

284
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:26,068
'Cause that would kill him.

285
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,906
[Mouth full] They have a horse!

286
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:34,443
So pick us because we're hard
workers, we love the show,

287
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:38,030
and we're females getting
their own, on their own.

288
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,082
And cut! That was so great.

289
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,067
Chestnut walking in out of nowhere,

290
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,703
we could not have planned that.

291
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:44,921
Oh, but I did.

292
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:46,622
That's our gimmick. Try to beat that.

293
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,007
Two girls with a horse.

294
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:52,261
And how is this not a porn film?

295
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:56,582
♪ I knew it, we got it ♪

296
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:58,684
♪ I knew it, I saw it! ♪

297
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:00,753
Is this how you imagined
it when you were laughing

298
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,638
<i>at all the dumb-dumbs on cupcake wars?</i>

299
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,941
I cannot believe I am auditioning

300
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:06,091
<i>to be on Cupcake Wars.</i>

301
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,894
I am on the show I watch!

302
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,278
Life is totally awesome.

303
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,864
<i>Good morning. I'm the Cupcake Wars</i>

304
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,766
talent coordinating producer, Janis.

305
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:16,602
You are awesome. Your show's awesome.

306
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:19,038
Who would I talk to about
getting a mug to take home?

307
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,607
Not a gift shop.

308
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:24,243
Janis, hi, I'm Caroline,
and this is my partner, Max.

309
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,178
Loved your tape. Great characters.

310
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,580
- We are?
- We are.

311
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:29,382
Look, we're about to
start with the team intros.

312
00:12:29,384 --> 00:12:31,283
The other team is up first and then you.

313
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:32,902
And remember to B.Y.O.B.

314
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:34,887
Oh, if I had known I was
allowed to bring a bottle in,

315
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,138
I wouldn't have chugged it in the bathroom.

316
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,257
Max, that's not what she meant.

317
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,226
The food network is very pg.

318
00:12:40,228 --> 00:12:41,394
Janis, B.Y.O.B.?

319
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:42,678
"Bring your own brand."

320
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,063
Just like you did on your home tape.

321
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,766
You're edgy with big boobs.
You're the "try hard."

322
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:48,134
I'm sorry, I'm the what?

323
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:49,685
That's your brand.

324
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:50,903
The muscle and the hustle.

325
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:55,191
The double-D's and the ditz.

326
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:57,493
I went to Wharton. I'm not a ditz.

327
00:12:57,495 --> 00:13:00,312
Well you ain't the double-D's.

328
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:04,417
Can you believe she openly
commented on m'goods?

329
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,002
All right, we're ready for team one.

330
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:08,504
Step up.

331
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,673
You have 30 seconds.

332
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:13,492
Okay, cute aprons. But what's their brand?

333
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,962
In five, four, three, two...

334
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,163
- Hi, I'm Felicia.
- And I'm Blanche,

335
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,499
and we're representing the Crescent City.

336
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,436
Both: We're talking
about New Orleans, y'all!

337
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,472
Cute accents, but no one has
a scrappier story than us.

338
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:29,675
Back in 2005, when hurricane Katrina hit...

339
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,444
Say what?

340
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:34,113
And the levee broke and
flooded our whole neighborhood.

341
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:35,231
Say what?

342
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,850
Our community was
devastated, and we thought,

343
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:39,902
"hell yes, Katrina hit us hard."

344
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,204
"But hell no! We're not giving up."

345
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,408
We needed to find a way
to keep on keepin' on.

346
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,128
Katrina? Their brand is Katrina?

347
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,864
Even m'goods can't upstage that.

348
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:54,016
<i>We want to win Cupcake Wars</i>

349
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:56,252
so we can finally open a storefront

350
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,536
in our little neighborhood.

351
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,038
Make our business official.

352
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,974
Yeah, and find a way to put
money back into our community.

353
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:03,559
That's what we're all about at...

354
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,494
Both: Neighbor Cakes!

355
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,913
Both: Boom! [Laughter]

356
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,015
Great, great.

357
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,733
Max's Homemade Cupcakes, you're up.

358
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:12,935
Why did we name the company after me?

359
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:13,969
"Neighbor Cakes" versus

360
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:16,889
"Max's narcissistic cupcakes"?

361
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:18,941
We're fine. Don't freak out.

362
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,559
Just do our thing, like we did at home.

363
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:21,761
No need to panic.

364
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:26,298

365
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,416
Yo, what's up?

366
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:29,168
I'm Max, of Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,323
'Cause she's a ho!

371
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,012
Uh, kind of.

372
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,131
We bake at home in our
apartment, which is...

373
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,051
Is a disaster area. Really, it's a mess.

374
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,435
And we don't have our rent.

I don't even know what's happening.

380
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,584
We bake because I lost all my money

381
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:04,487
and her mom drinks.

382
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:09,992

Okay. Well, okay.

Did I just freestyle rap?

385
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:18,717
Yes.

386
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,886
And you also called
our apartment a disaster

387
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:24,473
in front of two ladies
whose apartments washed away.

388
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:27,760
Hi. Everything okay over here?

389
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,678
Yep. Ditz and double-D's, on track.

B.Y.O.B.

391
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,314
Great. Can we all gather

392
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:34,733
to reveal the secret ingredients?

393
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,519
- What's it gonna be?
- It could be anything.

394
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:39,271
I once saw a St. Patrick's
day theme where a team made

395
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,656
a beer and lucky charms cupcake.

396
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:42,491
That's right up your
alley. I hope it's that.

397
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:43,692
Today's theme is...

398
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,679
- Soul food.
- Both: Whoo!

399
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:47,746
Ooh, we got this, sister!

400
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:51,117
- Sister, this is gotten.
- Whoo-hoo!

401
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,368
Some of the ingredients include

402
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,821
okra, molasses, collard
Greens, sweet potato,

403
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:58,240
buttermilk, chicken, and ham hock.

404
00:15:58,242 --> 00:15:59,375

Sister, we are screwed.

Ooh, with peanut molasses drizzle.

All we have to do is
pick three ingredients.

And we're ready to pop them in the oven!

424
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:51,312
How can they already be going in the oven?

425
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,480
- Oh, that gives me an idea!
- What?

426
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:55,449
Put me in the oven!

427
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:56,834
Okay, okay. We just have to start.

00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:57,918
It'll come to us.

00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,503

And now I'm using some flour.

Now we just have to pick something else.

There, ham.

What do you tell me to do?

484
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:43,057
Well, first, I tell you to leave

485
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,593
so I can get stoned with Oleg.

486
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:48,178
Okay, if I was stoned,

487
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,814
what would I know about soul food?

walk around with a purse full of confetti?

True. Hard to believe,

533
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:37,037
and you end up with a
mouth full of confetti.

534
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,123
Sophie's right.

535
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,492
We went on television with
the ridiculous expectation

536
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,177
that we'd make it overnight.

537
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:44,311
But that's not who we are.

538
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:45,929
We're gonna have to do it the hard way.

539
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:50,184
Slow and steady. The
tortoise and the whore.

540
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,553
Well, what can I say, "caramel?"

541
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:57,241
By the way, that's your whore name.

542
00:20:57,243 --> 00:21:01,395
Looks like it's back to
selling cakes one car at a time.

543
00:21:01,397 --> 00:21:04,498
I'll just put these "Ludacris
Specials" in the display case.

544
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
You do that, "Cinnamon."

545
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:08,836
Oh, no, I actually have a whore name,

546
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:12,172
and that's not it.

547
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:13,290
What is it?

548
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:17,911
Max. Duh.

549
