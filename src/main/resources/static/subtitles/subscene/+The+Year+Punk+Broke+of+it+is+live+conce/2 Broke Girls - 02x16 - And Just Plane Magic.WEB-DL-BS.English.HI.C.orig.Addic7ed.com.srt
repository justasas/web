Chainz.

348
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,710
Stop.
No way.

349
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:46,096
I can't believe
it's you flying this plane.

350
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,098
Caroline, it's been so long
since I've seen you.

351
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,017
- Bring it in.
- Oh, Max, this is Bill.

352
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,935
- The pilot.
- The pilot?

353
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:53,737
Why is he walking around?

354
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:56,406
Brace for crash!
Brace for crash!

355
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,525
It's okay, it's on autopilot.

356
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:01,561
Autopilot.
That's how I live my life.

357
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:03,113
Pilot Bill is an old pal.

358
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:05,198
He used to fly my friends
and I around in college.

359
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,167
Yeah, good times.

360
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:08,735
This is my friend, Max,

361
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,737
and it's her very first time
on an airplane.

362
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,089
Hey, mine too.

363
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,790
J.K.

364
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,342
Listen, Max, why don't you
take a stroll down there

365
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:16,460
and check out the cockpit?

366
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,627
The cockpit?

367
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:18,962
If it's anything
like the gay bar

368
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:20,547
on 14th street,
I'm not dressed right.

369
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:23,350
[Laughs]
It is so good to see you.

370
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:25,752
And, God, I'd forgotten
how beautiful you are.

371
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:27,604
Oh, thank you, Pilot Bill.

372
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:30,140
You know, I never thought
I had a chance with you before

373
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:33,143
because you had so much money
and I was 20 years older,

374
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:36,146
but now you're broke
and I had a facelift,

375
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,115
so we're kinda
on the same level.

376
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:40,367
Oh, a facelift?

377
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,069
That's why your face
is so tight and pink?

378
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,487
I thought maybe
you were in a fire.

379
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,322
But you look good.

380
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,407
- Sure, let's go out.
- Great.

381
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:48,492
I'm gonna grab a coffee.

382
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:51,661
I'll be right back.

383
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,498
What you doing going out
with a guy like that?

384
00:15:57,753 --> 00:15:59,970
Well, here's the thing, 2.

385
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,888
You don't tell the pilot
flying the plane you're on

386
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,507
that you don't wanna
go out with him.

387
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,125
Got you.

388
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:07,144
You just keep flirting
with him until we land.

389
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:10,479
I gotta make it
to the Grammys.

390
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:13,483
So, Max, you've really
never been on a plane before?

391
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,152
Well, technically
it's my second time

392
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,854
if you count Rock-O-Plane ride
at the carnival.

393
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:19,856
Guess I was rockin'
that plane too hard,

394
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:21,025
'cause halfway
through the ride,

395
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:24,144
my mini-747 fell off its gears,
and I crashed to the ground.

396
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:25,979
There would have been
a lawsuit,

397
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:27,531
but the carnie paid me off
with a snow cone,

398
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,500
and also no one cared
about me as a child.

399
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:32,536
Well, go ahead,
put your hands on the wheel.

400
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:34,838
- Give it a spin.
- No, I'm good.

401
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,374
Wow, we are really up there.

402
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:38,875
I have never been this high.

403
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:41,178
And trust me,
I have been high.

404
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,495
Yeah, I hear that.

405
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:45,830
No one liked to get high
more than me.

406
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,435
I did everything--
pills, weed, coke,

407
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:51,770
and what's that called when you
crumble the coke on your weed?

408
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:55,440
Anyway, I loved to get high.

409
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:57,394
But that's all
way behind me now.

410
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:58,862
I've been clean and sober

411
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:01,481
ever since that Denzel
<i>Flight</i> movie came out.

412
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:03,483
It's still in the theaters.

413
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:05,685
Yep, saw it last week.

414
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:08,121
Maybe I will
put my hands on the wheel.

415
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:09,489
You know, just in case.

417

all over again!

418
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,081
I broke the plane!
I broke the plane!

419
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,699
Okay, everything's
under control.

420
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:21,701
Just sit down, sit down.
Put your seat belt on.

421
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:25,036
And, uh, Caroline,
here's my cellular.

422
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,674
Of course, you can always still
get me at my mom's, so--

423
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:29,559
[Thud]
- Go save the plane!

424
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,761
Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:33,063
We'll be fine.

426
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:34,881
I was not meant to die
as the second banana

427
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:37,150
in a cross-country
booty call.

What did she say?

431
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,745
I have no idea.

432
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:52,065
I heard "love" and "why now?"
So just in case.

433
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,784
I should tell you I took
$10 out of the cupcake fund

434
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,453
for a Big Mac
and never told you.

435
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:59,239
I should tell you I took $100
out of the cupcake fund

436
00:17:59,241 --> 00:18:01,074
to keep my hair
this naturally blonde.

437
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,409
Okay, everybody.
We got a bit of a situation.

438
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:08,081
Looks like my new girlfriend's
friend broke the plane.

439
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,967
No, I'm just kidding.
We had some engine trouble.

440
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,803
We're going to have to make
an emergency landing in Kansas.

441
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:16,473
Go, Chiefs!

442

Hey, blondie.

443
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,476
Why don't you
keep us in the air?

444
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:22,646
How about you go give
the pilot a little love?

445
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:27,708
[Hair dryer hums]
Okay.

446
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,926
Okay, thank you.

447
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:30,094
Well, good news.

448
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:31,178
We're not stranded here.

449
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,747
I just got off the phone,

450
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:35,549
and according to my new
boyfriend, Captain facelift,

451
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:38,436
your new boyfriend, the brit,
is flying us home tomorrow

452
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:40,771
on a commercial flight.
Coach.

453
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:43,991
What?

454
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:47,244
I don't do coach.

455
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:50,064
And I am pretty positive
2 Chainz would have taken us

456
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,833
on that other plane they sent if
you hadn't rapped for 30 minutes

457

in that corn field
after we landed.

458

I don't care what you say.

459
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:59,239

Here, let's eat something.

461
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:01,792
They delivered the food.

462
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:03,911
Slim Jims, Cheez-its,
Pizza Pringles,

463
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:05,963
and two ham
and cheese sandwiches.

464
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:08,799
Ham?
Where's the prosciutto?

465
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:10,134
There is none.

<i>Mais pourquoi?</i>

467
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:15,638
Because we're
at a motel in Kansas.

468
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:17,641
And the lady at the front desk
called me a snob

469
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:20,027
for ordering
the Pizza Pringles.

470
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,697
I can't believe
I'm not at the Grammys,

471
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:26,032
and I'm stuck here eating a
lousy vending machine sandwich.

472
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:29,485
Well, it's better than doing
those ketchups in the diner.

473
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:32,540
And crash-landing
in a corn field with a rap star

474
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:35,493
with our heads still attached--
that's pretty magical, right?

475
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:38,129
Yeah, and 2 Chainz did say

476
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:41,464
he enjoyed meeting us and that
we're two fine, big booty hos.

That's pretty magical.

when he finds out

to fix your own mistakes,

you've gotta make
your own magic.
