1
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:05,245
Max, look out,
you're so tired

2
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:06,691
you're spilling batter
all over yourself.

3
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:07,914
Ugh.

4
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:09,249
I knew it was only
a matter of time

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,531
before I became
a battered woman.

6
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:14,658
This is
a huge disappointment.

7
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:16,618
I heard that.

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,787
You don't even know
what I'm referring to.

9
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:21,998
Oh, I just assumed we were
talking about everything.

10
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:23,680
I'm referring
to our expensive

11
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,098
new cupcake website.

12
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:26,503
Not one job offer.

13
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:28,819
You want a website that will make you
feel better about yourself?

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,600
Go to
models-falling-down.com

15
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,763
Klum goes boom.

16
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:40,851
It's 3:00 A.M.
Who would be coming over now?

17
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:43,149
I don't know,
my dealer, my other dealer?

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,203
That guy who always asks
if I know where my dealer is?

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,790
- Who is it?
- You can't handle

20
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,570
what's on the other
side of that door.

21
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:53,527
Yesterday,
I saw a guy on a stoop

22
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:54,711
frenching his cat.

23
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:57,097
I can handle anything.

24
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:04,437
Oleg, what are you
doing here?

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,461
And you put the, "oh, no,"
in kimono.

26
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,493
Your upstairs neighbor
Sophie

27
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:11,339
is allowing me
to have sex with her.

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,864
And I came down to borrow
some sensual oils.

29
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,449
Preferably,
ones that you can eat.

30
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,515
How did you
get out of apartment?

31
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:22,405
You know the rules.

32
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:25,525
I came down
to borrow sensual oils.

33
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:27,410
Yeah, but no peppermint.

34
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:29,379
It makes his tongue swell.

35
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,797
And let's face it,

36
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:34,696
his tongue is the best part
about him.

37
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:38,271
You're right,
I can't handle that.

38
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,447
those nice smelling men
in booth two

39
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:55,061
just asked me
if I was on the down-low.

40
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:56,534
What does this mean?

41
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:02,602
They said,
"are you on the down-low,

42
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,835
because we have a friend
who is a big-time rice queen."

43
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:08,630
Again, coming up dry.

44
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:10,799
Rice queen, is it, like,
a Korean dairy queen?

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,779
Kind of.

46
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:15,470
Here's table seven's check,
Earl.

47
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:17,138
Max,
the guys at booth two

48
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,099
just asked Han
if was on the down-low.

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,101
They think he's gay.

50
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,405
That's a step up.

51
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:25,792
Usually people think
he's a lesbian.

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,693
Here you go, Sophie.

53
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:32,715
Uh, Max, Caroline.

54
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,656
Yeah, about last night,

55
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:38,660
I hope we can keep that
just between us girls.

56
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,690
I'm sure we have all
done things in the dark

57
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:44,374
late at night with men
that we'd like to forget.

58
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,446
Why stop at late at night
in the dark?

59
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:47,864
How about early morning?

60
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,713
Or a nooner at
the port authority bus terminal?

61
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:52,215
Oh, good.

62
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,300
And you too understand,
Caroline?

63
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,855
Actually, no, sorry.

64
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,240
I haven't ever done
anything with a man

65
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,125
- that I'm ashamed of.
- Oh, yeah.

66
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,793
But your father did
steal millions

67
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:04,102
and millions of dollars.

68
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:06,529
So... don't forget that.

69
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:12,037
Han just sat
your favorite gays.

70
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:14,474
Max, their names
are Steven and Michael.

71
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:16,906
And it's not very P.C. To reduce
people to a stereotype.

72
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:21,064
- Hey, girl.
- What's up, care bear?

73
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:22,648
Yeah, they're not
stereotypes.

74
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:24,517
What would you say
if they called you

75
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:26,332
"the big-boob waitress from
the wrong side of the tracks

76
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,126
who had sex
with everyone in high school"?

77
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,906
I'd say,
"that's why I love the gays.

78
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:31,796
They get me."

79
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:33,276
Come over and say hello.

80
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:34,744
They're the first
and practically the only

81
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:37,010
people that ever hired us
to do a cupcake job.

82
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,498
Do I have to?

83
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:40,513
Can't I just stand here
and judge from afar?

84
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,016
Come on, and let's not
mention how bad we're doing.

85
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,754
We want them to think
we're a big success,

86
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:46,471
so they'll recommend us
for their friends' events.

87
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:49,063
Yeah, because you know the gays,
they party about everything.

88
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:52,428
And there's
another stereotype.

89
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:55,111
- Hi, guys.
- Happy leap year!

90
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:57,016
F.Y.I., people
are still talking about

91
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,990
those cupcakes you made
for our wedding shower.

92
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,887
- Everyone.
- How's business?

93
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,772
Fabulous, amazing,
killing it.

94
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:05,455
Or it's killing us.
We're not quite sure.

95
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:07,593
I'll go grab some menus
for you girls.

96
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,061
- Max.
- Sorry.

97
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:12,295
I'll go grab some menus
for you ladies.

98
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:14,839
<i>Love her... so Madeleine Stowe
in revenge.</i>

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,174
Oh, she is.

100
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:17,870
- I don't watch that.
- We love it.

101
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,288
It's all about
a young blonde woman

102
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,790
who's out to seek revenge
on everyone

103
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,305
for destroying her family.

104
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:24,911
Yeah, too close to home.

105
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:27,914
- Max, guess what.
- Caroline, you're not

106
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:29,582
<i>supposed to tell me
I'm on intervention</i>

107
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,814
until the actual
intervention.

108
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:33,983
I just got offered $600

109
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,621
to stay at Steven
and Michael's apartment

110
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:37,056
and watch their dogs
while they're out of town

111
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,458
- for two days.
- Why would anyone pay $600

112
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,532
to watch dogs
for two days?

113
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,962
Well, because, you know,
they want a certain

114
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,296
amount of attention
to be paid to the...

115
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:48,039
Just say it, they're gay and they think
their dogs are their children.

116
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,166
Max, you have to stop
doing this.

117
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,043
I'll stop
when they stop.

118
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:53,689
This is so exciting.

119
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,808
It'll be like a paid vacation
at an amazing hotel.

120
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,216
And I need to get as far away
from here as possible.

121
00:04:58,217 --> 00:05:00,843
- Oh, where do they live?
- Four blocks away.

122
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:02,748
Well, have a good time.

123
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:04,534
And while you're
four blocks away

124
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:06,285
having your vacation,
I'll be home

125
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,671
maybe taking a little
masturbacation.

126
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:12,208
What are you
talking about?

127
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,993
I wouldn't go on vacation
without you.

128
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:15,545
We'll split the dog money
to cover the shifts

129
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,068
we take off
from the diner.

130
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:18,681
Well, thanks,
but I don't do that thing

131
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,113
where you take off work.

132
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:22,334
"Hi, I'm Max, I can't go

133
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:24,492
"to a fancy apartment
and have fun.

134
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:25,855
"I'd rather work
in a steel mill

135
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:28,421
and sing
Bruce Springsteen songs."

136
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,777
Max, when was the last time
you had a vacation?

137
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,001
Never.

138
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,580
Unless you count
the summer I hid

139
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:37,672
under the front porch
from my mom's new boyfriend.

140
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:38,951
We really need
to get out of here.

141
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:40,486
This is more than just
spring break.

142
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:41,821
It's a break
from the diner,

143
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:44,207
from the cupcake business,
from being poor,

144
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,097
from everything
depressing right now.

145
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:48,578
Things aren't
that depressing.

146
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:10,747
Oh.

147
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:13,853
Yeah, well,
I'm sure we have

148
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:17,773
all done things with men
in kitchens that...

149
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:19,525
We are not proud of.

150
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,759
Spring break
is the greatest time ever.

151
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,711
You just go crazy
and do shots

152
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:37,811
and throw all the rules
out the window.

153
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:39,515
Oh, I've done that.

154
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:42,301
But when you're poor,
you just call it Tuesday.

155
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,690
Why are you
walking like that?

156
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,442
This is my
spring break walk.

157
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,160
These shoulders
have shimmied like this

158
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,895
all the way
from Majorca to Ibiza.

159
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:54,530
Try it, Max.
Shake a little.

160
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,148
- Shake.
- That's cool.

161
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,784
I'll just wait till
I get the DTS later.

162
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,406
Maybe I don't
have the right key.

163
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,796
Oh, hi.

164
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:07,090
Sorry, I think we might
be at the wrong door.

165
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,925
That's a bummer
for the door.

166
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,546
It's over there, 12d.

167
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,262
We're house-sitting
for a few days.

168
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:13,638
Cool, I'm Brendon.

169
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,885
Hey, Brendon.
I'm Ashley.

170
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:19,088
- And...
- I'm surprised.

171
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,057
- And also Max.
- I'd shake your hands,

172
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:22,558
but I kind of stink.

173
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,310
I've been at my microbrewery
most of the day,

174
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,776
so I am sorry
if I smell like yeast.

175
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,154
Hey, that's my apology.

176
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:32,234
Whoa, all right, cool.

177
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:34,826
Well, I will see
you guys around, yeah?

178
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:37,273
Yeah, totes.

179
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:42,244
You have something
you want to tell me, Ashley?

180
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:44,330
I never use Caroline channing
on vacation

181
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,731
for security reasons.

182
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,283
I was almost abducted
at gunpoint

183
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:49,007
for a ransom
in Mexico city.

184
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:50,419
Wow, gunpoint.

185
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,469
Were you using the word,
"totes" at the time?

186
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,847
Can you take out the paper
that has the alarm code on it?

187
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,186
Wow, this place
is amazing.

188
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:04,100
<i>It's, like, the cover
of gay gay gay magazine.</i>

189
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:07,686
Max, you have to stop
reducing them

190
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,254
to that gay stereotype.

191
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,891
Now, read me
the security code.

192
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,909
It's..."Liza."

193
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,780
A lot of different
types of people

194
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,288
like Liza Minnelli.

195
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:27,212
Oh, look,
it's a poodle in a tutu.

196
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:30,292
That's not gay, right?

197
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,294
Lots of...
Lots of different

198
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:36,715
types of people
have a poodle in a tutu...

199
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,766
Named Barbra Streisand.

200
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:44,240
Oh, there's the book
of instructions.

201
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,856
"Hey, girl.
Hey, care bear.

202
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:49,562
"Have fun with Barbra Streisand
and Wynonna Judd.

203
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,313
"Wynonna is a little
temperamental

204
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,182
"and tends to stay
in the bedroom.

205
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:56,318
"We didn't have time to purge
her anal gland before left.

206
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,576
Instructions on page two."

207
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:01,579
I'm starting
to understand the $600.

208
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,026
"Don't worry, it's easy.
We do it all the time."

209
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:06,311
No wonder Wynonna's
so temperamental.

210
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,197
"Help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

211
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,797
There are portable saunas
in the closet."

212
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:12,151
Portable saunas?

213
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,768
Love it, what is it?

214
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,609
This is so cool.

215
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,475
I'm hot
like I'm at the beach,

216
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:25,562
but I'm not stepping
in any used condoms.

217
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:26,799
Yeah, these are great.

218
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,167
My friend
Candice travelstead

219
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,316
used one to make weight
for prom.

220
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:31,887
Are you done with that?

221
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,856
Yeah, switch?

222
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,057
On spring break,
I always loved

223
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,364
spending the day
at the beach.

224
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,908
Just the chilling
and the girl talk.

225
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,679
Yeah.
Tell me again,

226
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,329
about the sound the anal gland
made when you squeezed it.

227
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,700
Please, stop.

228
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,351
I already told you twice.

229
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,418
And now, wynonna Judd
won't even look at me.

230
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,240
Well, not without
her lawyer in the room.

231
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm hungry.
What do you eat on vacation?

232
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,544
Anything we want.

233
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,329
Let's see.

234
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,867
I bet their refrigerator is
stocked with all kinds of pates

235
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,753
and cheeses
and those parm crisp things.

236
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,388
By the way, nice suit.

237
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,224
You look like someone should
be pouring a 40 on you

238
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:09,942
in a rap video.

239
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,878
Thanks.

240
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,230
There's nothing.

241
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,905
I mean, come on,
what kind of gays are they?

242
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:19,449
All anal gland
and no cheese.

243
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,687
I just expected
everything to be better.

244
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,411
You know,
champagne on ice,

245
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:25,107
thousand
thread-count sheets.

246
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,624
I mean, the towels...
They're not even bath sheets.

247
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,078
Wait, the towels
aren't good?

248
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,503
Because I already stole two.

249
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:32,781
They're fine,
they're just not

250
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:34,088
what I was expecting.

251
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:35,668
What's happening
over there?

252
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,134
You could use
a little shoulders.

253
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,072
You're right,
enough, we're on vacay.

254
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,874
Come on, let's go get dressed
and find someplace to eat.

255
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,876
Are you crazy?
I am not leaving this thing.

256
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,559
This is the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

257
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,631
Okay, we'll order in,
pretend it's room service.

258
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:51,022
They must have a menu drawer
here somewhere.

259
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:52,268
Plus, we'll never
find a restaurant

260
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:54,150
with a portable sauna
section.

261
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:56,355
"Food network party tonight

262
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,440
"to celebrate
the release of a cookbook.

263
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,864
Food and drink provided."

264
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:02,478
Free foodie food,
free foodie drinks?

265
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,813
- Yay, let's go.
- No, I like it in here.

266
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:06,579
It's amazing.

267
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,267
Ashley wants to go.

268
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,286
Ashley wants to go.

269
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,377
Fine,
but can I bring the dog?

270
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:13,789
I've always wanted
to be one of those girls

271
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,491
who brings a tiny dog
to a public place

272
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,209
and just
looks at everyone, like,

273
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,717
"yeah, I have a tiny dog,
so what?"

274
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:21,580
You can be whoever
you want to be.

275
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,865
You're on vacation.

276
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,466
I'm gonna go invite
Brendon to come.

277
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,474
You gotta have a crush
on spring break.

278
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:28,887
Well,
I'm sitting in my crush.

279
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,687
Hey, shouldn't you
put something on?

280
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,572
Uh, it's spring break.

281
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,064
Aah!

282
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:43,819
Barbra, get help.

283
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,605
Go, Barbra Streisand, go.

284
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:52,644
Hey,
look at the book title,

285
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,212
<i>Bacon.</i>

286
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,835
Heaven bacon.
That's good wordplay.

287
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,503
It's okay.
Not much of a crowd.

288
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,136
Party's a little
disappointing.

289
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:05,591
Bacon truffle,
Barbra Streisand?

290
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,849
Mm?

291
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,997
Yeah, I'm feeding my tiny dog
a truffle, so what?

292
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,832
Miss, miss.

293
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,565
Excuse me,
what are these things for?

294
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,025
Oh, it holds your drink
while you get food.

295
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:19,688
- No!
- Yeah.

296
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:22,196
Yeah, these are great when
you see them for the first time.

297
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:23,942
For me,
it was on a yacht

298
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,158
in the Mediterranean.

299
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,179
You know what else
these are good for?

300
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,621
Frees up your shoulders
to shimmy.

301
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,040
You shimmy.
I'm gonna walk over here

302
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,419
and find us a bigger, shinier
something to do later.

303
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,856
Later?
We're going home

304
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,708
- to our amazing apartment.
- Or not.

305
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,160
Come on, Max,
it's spring break.

306
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,745
Let's not get tied down.

307
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:44,163
I'll be over there.

308
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,864
Yeah, we'll be over there.

309
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,549
Oh.

310
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:51,768
Hi. You're not allowed
to have dog in here.

311
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:53,686
Unless he wants
to buy the book.

312
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:56,356
What are you,
some kind of foodie bouncer?

313
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:58,441
Worse.
I wrote the book.

314
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,234
Yeah, nice sleeves.

315
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:03,816
You get those in
the tattoo gold rush of '09?

316
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,156
I'm Zeke.
What's your name?

317
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:07,436
I'm Max.
This is my tiny dog.

318
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:09,869
I take her everywhere,
so what?

319
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,664
Hey, Max, you wanna try
my thick-cut bacon?

320
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:15,611
Maybe. Let's just
take things slow.

321
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:18,397
I'm telling you,
it serves

322
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,115
the best
vegan stew anywhere.

323
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,881
You really should put it
in your blog.

324
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:24,253
Oh, if I write one more
article about something vegan,

325
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:27,539
all of my devoted
10,000 readers will hold hands

326
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,306
and jump collectively
out a window.

327
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:33,578
And I know you like to find
what's new and what's next.

328
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,811
Chocolate bacon?

329
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:38,050
I just need
a minute over there.

330
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,483
Hi, couldn't help
but overhear.

331
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,020
If you're looking
for what's new,

332
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,755
I found these
two adorable girls

333
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,154
who run a cupcake business

334
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,608
out of their home
in Williamsburg.

335
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:48,394
I know how that sounds,
but trust me,

336
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,910
totally fresh
and not at all overexposed.

337
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:53,121
And you're someone
I should listen to because...?

338
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:55,284
Sorry,
didn't introduce myself.

339
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:58,084
<i>Ashley Emerson,
style editor for Elle.</i>

340
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,294
Oh.

341
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:01,773
If you're interested,
I think I might have

342
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,941
a card in here somewhere.

343
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,924
Was holding on to it
for Martha.

344
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:08,213
Mr. Bacon action figure.

345
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,346
A world of bacon sampler.

346
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,501
And I want to apologize for
the food network trucker hat,

347
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,952
which has nothing
to do with bacon

348
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,787
and everything to do
with me being a sellout.

349
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,889
Guess what.

350
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,354
Ashley just gave our card

351
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:21,593
to a woman who's such a bitch
she must be important.

352
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,845
She's a food blogger.

353
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:23,979
It's a long shot,

354
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,564
but we need to get
some exposure.

355
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,149
Whoa, we are on vacation.

356
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,152
No business talk.
That was the deal, right?

357
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:34,239
This is Zeke, chef-slash-
author-slash-corporate sellout.

358
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,414
We were, uh...

359
00:14:36,415 --> 00:14:38,160
We were thinking about
going back to the apartment

360
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,579
- to hang out.
- Oh, sounds fun.

361
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,170
Can I see you alone
for a second?

362
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,615
Well, not alone.

363
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,299
I bring my tiny dog
everywhere, so what?

364
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,154
Come on, I heard
of an after-party in Soho

365
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,089
and an after-after-party
in dumbo.

366
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,341
So, let's go-ho.

367
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:54,766
Have fun and get
this vacation started.

368
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,463
I'm holding a tiny dog
at a bacon-book party

369
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,932
and laughing with a guy
who wrote a book about bacon.

370
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,940
I think my vacation's
already started.

371
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:04,553
All right,
well, have fun.

372
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,151
I'm gonna go par-tay.

373
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:09,391
Eh, did your thing, Ash.

374
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,506
I don't want
to say that I'm hot.

375
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:20,093
But the bacon
in my pocket is done.

376
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:22,895
We said turns were
five minutes, you bastards.

377
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:26,331
Oh, hi.
More sauna fun.

378
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:28,351
Max, can I see you
in the hall for a second?

379
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:32,304
But it's my turn
to sweat my balls off.

380
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:35,590
Don't think the clock's
not running while I'm out there.

381
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,309
We're going
on a real vacation.

382
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,010
How quickly
can you pack a bag?

383
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:40,562
And don't worry about
appropriate evening wear.

384
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:41,897
Every four seasons
has a Gucci

385
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,825
near the Bulgari store
in the lobby.

386
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,518
None of those words
made any sense.

387
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,454
I think you've had
a spring break stroke.

388
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:50,739
No, seriously, there's a car
waiting downstairs

389
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,491
to take us
to a private plane.

390
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:53,992
We can be at Teterboro
in 20 minutes

391
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:55,243
and Tahiti in 8 hours.

392
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:57,896
The Greek
is paying for everything.

393
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:59,865
What did they give you?

394
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,009
What's the last thing
you can remember?

395
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,668
Nothing.

396
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,221
I just had some cristal.

397
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:07,682
Some cristal meth?

398
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:09,424
No, I'm just
really excited.

399
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:12,093
I went to the after-party
and this shipping magnate.

400
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:13,678
Don't worry,
it's not gonna be sexual.

401
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,413
More like a father thing.

402
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:18,109
Anyway, let's go... finally
got us a good vacation.

403
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,194
But we're having
a good vacation.

404
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:21,920
Max, don't take this
personally,

405
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:23,588
but you don't know what
a good vacation is

406
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,158
because you've
never been anywhere.

407
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,243
I mean, you walked
into that apartment

408
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:30,362
and your face lit up, like...
Like it was amazing.

409
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:32,447
And that's because
you don't know that it's not.

410
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:34,983
Trust me.
I've been everywhere.

411
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:38,713
And I'm telling you,
this is the worst vacation ever.

412
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:41,940
So let's ditch the bacon freak
and the beer bro,

413
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:44,442
get on that plane, spend
one great day at the beach,

414
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:46,804
and then come back
and make $8 an hour.

415
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,496
That sounds fun.

416
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:50,131
You kind of skipped over
the part where we get abducted

417
00:16:50,132 --> 00:16:52,133
and Nancy grace
covers the year-long search

418
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,644
for our bodies.

419
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:56,939
It must be Constantine.
He's gonna be upset.

420
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,624
You never
keep a Greek waiting.

421
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,259
Oh, my God, Max,
we just got an email

422
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,762
on our website from that
food blogger at the book party.

423
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:06,014
She said if we drop off four
cupcakes by tomorrow morning,

424
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:08,984
she'll consider writing about
them for her column that day.

425
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:10,745
Well, what's it gonna be,
Caroline or Ashley?

426
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:13,939
Cupcakes or Tahiti?
Your call.

427
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,834
Is the Greek
still waiting?

428
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,743
He just pulled away.

429
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:20,880
I'm sure he'll come back here
for Ashley sometime.

430
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:23,591
And when that happens,
I wouldn't want to be her.

431
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:26,219
Well, after tomorrow,
you won't be.

432
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,345
What can I do?

433
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,087
You mean after
your two personalities

434
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,057
meet and kill each other?

435
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:32,958
Max, I told you
I needed a break.

436
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,561
I just didn't know it was
gonna be a psychotic one.

437
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:37,045
You really need
to chill.

438
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:38,463
You can't
keep freaking out

439
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:39,798
because you're not where
you want to be...

440
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,800
On vacation
or in our business.

441
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:44,904
I mean, it's life.
Lower your expectations.

442
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:46,989
This microbrew
is actually really good.

443
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,007
Tastes better
in the batter.

444
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:51,410
Hey, crumble up some of that
maple bacon for me.

445
00:17:51,411 --> 00:17:53,194
Sorry about
that stuff I said

446
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:55,081
about you never having
gone anywhere.

447
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:56,681
Why?
I never have gone anywhere

448
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:58,533
or done anything.

449
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,285
And now I'm thinking
that's kind of a good thing,

450
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:02,404
because I can still
get excited and make a face

451
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:04,205
when something's new to me.

452
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:05,508
'Cause, basically,
everything is.

453
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,134
That must be nice.

454
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:10,596
All right, here,
taste it.

455
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:14,049
My beer-batter, maple bacon,
spring break cupcake.

456
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:20,731
Oh, my God, you made
the "something new" face.

457
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,391
I did, because
you made something new.

458
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:26,761
- It's delicious.
- Do the face again.

459
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,123
Oh, there they are,
the world travelers.

460
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:39,333
Shouldn't people be throwing
confetti or something?

461
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,059
I'm all out.

462
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,779
I snorted mine
in the power outage of '65.

463
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,215
How was your vacation?

464
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,533
Well, it turned out
to be more of a daycation,

465
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:50,401
but we had a great time,
didn't we, Max?

466
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:51,920
Yes, we did.

467
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,223
Max, things sure are dull
around here without you.

468
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:55,907
Everyone walking around
all P.C.,

469
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,402
nobody called me black.
Hell.

470
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,180
I haven't left once
since you've been gone.

471
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:05,234
When it comes to this job,
you are my vacation.

472
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,918
Aw.

473
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,087
And that, Earl,
is why I got

474
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,773
all five
of these gift bags for you.

475
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,427
Welcome, again,
to the Williamsburg diner.

476
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:18,289
This way, please.

477
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,233
I have looked up "down-low"
and "rice queen" on Wikipedia.

478
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,435
And, no, I'm not
a secret homosexual

479
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:26,964
or a man who chases
only Asian men.

480
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,059
I'm great, I'm straight.
Get used to it.

481
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,878
Hi, guys.
How was your vacation?

482
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:35,932
Great. Did you have fun
at our place?

483
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,975
Totes.
Your saunas are sick.

484
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,062
I know.
Could they be any gayer?

485
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:43,454
No.

486
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:46,007
Just one thing.
Wynonna's still a little upset

487
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:47,735
about the anal gland event.

488
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:49,344
What?

489
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:52,347
I told you she wouldn't
know it was a joke.

490
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:58,636
How could she not know
it was a joke?

491
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:02,083
I mean, who would ask someone
to squeeze their dog's pooper?

492
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:04,168
We're paying you
another 50.

493
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,661
Dude, she went
second knuckle deep

494
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:10,800
in your beagle's back door
for only another 50?

495
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,259
150.

496
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,152
Thank you.

497
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:15,670
And just one other thing.

498
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:17,989
Our business is actually
not that great right now,

499
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,707
so if you could recommend us
to any of your friends,

500
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,519
- that would really help.
- Good for you.

501
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,271
I'm sure business will
pick up after that blog blurb.

502
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,631
- Wait, blog blurb?
- About your beer-battered

503
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:28,099
maple bacon
spring break cupcake.

504
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,360
We just read about it.

505
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,779
Yeah, in that
foodie bitch's blog.

506
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,239
Max, it worked.

507
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,116
Let's go look at the blog
on Han's computer.

508
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,909
Excuse us.
We'll be right back.

509
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,861
We got a little break
and a big break.

510
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:50,688
Yeah,
I did it again.

511
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:53,124
Yeah.

512
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,531
Welcome back.

513
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:03,360
You missed the best
two days of my life.
