No, when I was 75, last year.

a nice bump of this.

00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:09,290
Max, I need you
to explain something to me

93

'cause I can't figure it out.

94
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:14,009

Max.

coming out.

- Hi, can I take your order?

104
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,759
All I knows is.
If I was doing my job

105
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:48,512
as bad as you two tonight,
I'd take my own life.

106
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:51,847
That's not off the table.

107
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,701

108
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,986

we got two hours of sleep.

109
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,188
We just want to get home
and climb into bed.

110
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,523
You're sleeping together?

111
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:05,110
I mean, it's been a "will they
or won't they" since they met.

112

Hi, everybody.
Sophie's here!

113
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:13,919

It's double-breasted.

114
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:18,392
Pretty nice, huh?
It was a gift from me.

115
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:20,077
It's the only thing
he ever gave me

116
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,412
that didn't threaten
my reproductive health.

117
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,683

took its own life

118

it was gonna be on.

119
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,187
What is the occasion?

120
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:33,522
What is the occasion?
I'm hot and it's cold.

121
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:37,644
And it's also the anniversary
of the first time

122
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:39,980
Oleg and I 70ed.

123
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:43,315
The way I do it,
it's one more than 69.

124
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,959
Max, I just hung up
from a very panicked phone call,

125
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:53,794
and you'll never believe
what happened.

126
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:55,412
The guy from the record store
called to say

127
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:57,998
I have super gonorrhea?

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,333

that you don't even remember

but it is super-bad news.

super gonorrhea!

137
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:28,245
Are you insane? We can't do

We<i>have</i>to do it.

139
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:31,448
It'll ruin our reputation
if we don't.

140
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,867
I know we're tired,
but if we stay up all night,

141
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:36,820
we'll have $4,000
by tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

142
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:38,822
They have to be done
by 10:00 a.m.?

143
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:42,157
I'm so tired, remind me--
Is a.m. the morning one?

144
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,711
We can't do it.
It's impossible.

145
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:46,680
My brain's too foggy
to crunch the numbers,

146
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:48,766
but I'm sure it's doable
if we leave right now.

147
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:50,434
We're in the middle
of waiting tables.

148
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:52,519
Well, we'll just have to
come up with an excuse.

149
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,522
Give me your hand, bend over,
and pretend to be sick.

150
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:58,008
It'll work. I've used this
to get out of eight jobs,

151
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,343
six final exams,
and one wedding.

152
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:03,831
Han, we have an emergency.
Caroline's sick.

153
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,016
She's so sick,
she can't even stand up.

154
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:07,651
We won't be able to stay
and finish our shift.

155
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:09,153
We have to go right
to the emergency room.

156
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:10,854
[Groans]

157
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:12,456
We don't know
what's wrong with her,

158
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,523
but it's coming out
of both ends.

159
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,375
It might be super gonorrhea.
Bye.

160
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:22,365
That's so unfortunate.

161
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,700
And on the night they were
finally gonna do it.

162
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,482
Whoa, those are some
big-ass coffees!

163
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:39,701
Yep, 64-ouncers.

164
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:42,003
They told me they're bigger
than the human stomach.

165
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,455
And the coffee's
already working,

166
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:44,956
'cause I figured out
if it's midnight now,

167
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,341
we have to be done
at 10:00 a.m.

168
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:48,360
So if it's 40 minutes per batch
from beginning to end,

169
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,579
baking 4 dozen at a time,
that's 48 cupcakes

170
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,247
times 20 trips to the oven,
which equals nine hours,

171
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:54,366
which equals $4,000.

172
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:57,701
Give me that.
Let's see if I can do math too.

173
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,255
Ask me something.

174
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:02,007
16 times 12.

175
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,542
I'm just going to enjoy
my coffee.

176
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,061
You enjoy,
I'll preheat the oven.

177
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,313
- What's the temp?
- 325.

178
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,881
There, that's the coffee
talking.

179
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:12,150
[Cell phone chimes]

180
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,019
[Laughs]

181
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:16,772
Andy just sent me a picture
of a deer nursing a turtle.

182
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:18,857
This is why they tell
teen turtles

183
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:20,742
never to post up on Facebook.

184
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:24,077
Oh, I didn't realize
you two were still texting.

185
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:25,781
Well, we're mostly
just sending pictures

186
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:27,565
of unlikely
animal friendships.

187
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,785
See, there's a bear napping
with a bunny.

188
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:31,203
And what's this?

189
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,088
It's a labradoodle
high-fiving a koi fish.

190
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,673
It's pretty self-explanatory.

191
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:37,876
No, underneath that.
This-- "How's Caroline?"

192
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:40,379
I thought this was just
an unlikely animal friendship.

193
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:42,747
It is, mostly,
but every other text,

194
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,883
I get the idea that
maybe he's not over you.

195
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,519
He's the one
who broke up with <i>me.</i>

196
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:49,554
Well, maybe he regrets it.

197
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:52,057
Maybe you two are like
Chris Brown and Rihanna,

198
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,643
minus the punching
and the duet.

199
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:56,528
I'm kind of surprised.

200
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,563
I thought you guys were
good together.

201
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:01,149
Andy is great.
And on the surface,

202
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:02,934
he was there for me
and very supportive.

203
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:05,404
But then he kind of got fed up
when it was so much about

204
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,488
me and my career.

205
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,273
And when push came to shove,
he felt like

206
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:10,992
he had to pull away
for his own well-being.

207
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:14,327
Oh, my God, we are
Rihanna and Chris Brown!

208
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:16,748
But I'm Chris Brown.

209
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,583
Speaking of Chris Brown,
I'm gonna start to batter.

210
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:23,138
How's that stove?

211
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,924
Warm, but it's really wobbly.

212
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:28,126
Yeah, it wobbles, it smokes,
and one time it burned me.

213
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:30,512
That's why I nicknamed it
"Mom."

214
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:32,464
What is this wood thing
under the leg?

215
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:34,182
It's the shim.

216
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:35,984
I think it's making it worse.

217
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:37,486
Don't!
That's holding the leg up!

218
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:40,638
Oh! Aah!

219
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,973
But I guess
you figured that out now.

220
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:46,862
You heard me say
it was the <i>shim!</i>

221
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:48,763
I don't know what a shim is.

222
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:51,249
I thought it was just
one of those things you say.

223
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:52,650
What did you think
it could be?

224
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:54,319
I thought it was
a cool word blend.

225
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:57,654
You know, like she/him
for a transsexual--a shim.

226
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,624
You thought a tiny transsexual
was holding up our stove?

227
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,879
Yes, Max, I'm that tired.

228
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:07,165
I thought a tiny transsexual
was holding up our stove.

229
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,051
This is a disaster, and our oven
at home's too small.

230
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:12,270
What are we gonna do now?

231
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,105
Oh, good, you're still here.

232
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:16,224
Don't anybody leave.
Our night just got worse.

233
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:19,559
Don't come any closer,
super gonorrhea!

234
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:23,346
I'm sorry to say we lied
to get off our shift.

235
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,484
But we have to bake
1,000 cupcakes by tomorrow,

236
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:27,986
and our oven broke at the shop,
and we need to use yours.

237
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:30,288
You lied to me,
and now you want a favor?

238
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,657
Yes. Han, we know
it's a big favor,

239
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:34,359
and it probably looks
even bigger to you,

240
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:37,629
but I'm sure you can
see past our lie.

241
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:39,364
And if you can't,
you can get up on that chair,

242
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:42,417
I could put you
on our shoulders...

243
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:45,637
Long story abnormally short,
will you help us?

244
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,972
Well, those 12 short jokes
really primed me.

245
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:50,392
Fine, you can use the oven

246
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,043
and any of the supplies
you need.

247
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:54,346
Thank you. We really need
to fill this order.

248
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:57,148
I'll stay and help.
I also had something to fill,

249
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,483
but I'll just text Sophie
and tell her I'm working.

250
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,487
I'll help too.

251
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:05,056
I can't bake, but I can sit
and lift the spirits.

252
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:08,391
As long as there are spirits.
It's open bar, right, Han?

253
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:11,828
Okay, I'm in too.
Earl, make me a sea breeze,

254
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,915
easy on the breezy.

255
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,067
You know,
because of my childhood,

256
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:17,619
I won't be able
to process the fact

257
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:19,204
that you've all just
done something nice for me,

258
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:22,040
so if I run into you
in ten years and start crying,

259
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:25,293
this is what it's about.

260
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:33,119
900 and counting.
Comin' through.

261
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,855
- Where do you want them?
- Put 'em over here,

262
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:37,824
next to the world's
slowest helper.

263
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,559
It took you longer
to make that one cupcake

264
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:42,629
than it took James Cameron
to make <i>Avatar.</i>

265
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:45,964
Well, I been doing this
for two minutes,

266
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:49,300
and I have to say...
Not for me.

267
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,240
But you know what is for me?

268
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:56,026
Another free cognac.

269
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:57,977
Ready for another
sea breeze, Han?

270
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,080
Not before I get this right.

271
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:03,116
And you don't want to see me
on two sea breezes.

272
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:06,451
What happens,
you become Lindsay <i>Llo-Han?</i>

273
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:10,321
Okay, let me show you
how it's done.

274
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:12,992
There, you feel
how that is, Han?

275
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:16,012
Uh, yes.

276
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,131
Now just squeeze that bag.

277
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:21,351
Good. Little harder.
Good. Little harder.

278
00:12:21,353 --> 00:12:24,686
Whoa! Oh...

279
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,273
I'm humiliated.

280
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:32,779
It's okay, Han, it happens
to a lot of guys

281
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:34,514
their first time.

282
00:12:35,316 --> 00:12:37,400
Get yourself a tissue
and clean yourself off,

283
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:39,869
like everyone else.

284
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:42,355
Han, you're off the bag.
I'm moving you to batter.

285
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:44,240
It's not a demotion, it's just
that you stink at this.

286
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,492
I wanna give you
something easier.

287
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:48,662
Max, you just got that
all over your apron.

288
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:50,863
I'll wipe it down.
Mine's a mess too.

289
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:52,365
Ooh, pretty slick move.

290
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,867
You wanna try for my bra next?

291
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:55,920
[Dumb brute voice]

292
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:57,220
Yeah, baby,

293
00:12:57,222 --> 00:13:00,555
I'll take off your bra.

294
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,311
What the hell was that?

295
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:06,429
What?
It's my guy voice.

296
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:09,065
That's your go-to
guy voice?

297
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:12,319
Is his identity being
protected on <i>Dateline?</i>

298
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,938
Well, what's your
guy voice like?

299
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,273
I'm doing it right now.

300
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:20,608
[Laughter]

301
00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:22,912
I'm gonna take
a quick pee break.

302
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:26,247
I don't know, I think you might
be making the drinks too strong.

303
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:28,585
We're not drunk, Oleg,
just punchy.

304
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:31,621
I'm just drunk.

305
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:38,492
It was so nice of everyone
to stay that long.

306
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:40,930
Everything's baked
except for those.

307
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,882
We're gonna make it, Max.

308
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:44,651
[Laughs]

309
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:47,120
Andy sent me
a cat and a dolphin kissing.

310
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:49,289
I hope they go all the way.
I'm dying to see their baby.

311
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,459
A cat-dolphin? Yes!

312
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:54,311
I don't think that's healthy.

313
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:55,879
Well, if they're in love,

314
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:57,597
it's really
none of your business.

315
00:13:57,599 --> 00:14:00,433
Why are you texting him
in the middle of the night?

316
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:03,470
In fact, why is he still up?
Is he talking about me?

317
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:04,387
You look upset.

318
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:05,689
Do you want me
to stop texting him?

319
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:08,441
No. It's fine.
It's just I'm tired

320
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,310
and we're almost finished,
and I just wanna go home.

321
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:12,612
Got it.
I'm so hot.

322
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,948
Let me just get
this hair off my neck.

323
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,684
Max, why are you wearing
only one earring?

324
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:20,036
What are you talking about?
I'm wearing two.

325
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:23,356
That's weird. Where is it?
Is it in my hair?

326
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:25,858
- No, no.
- Did it fall down?

327
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,910
Yeah, check your boobs.

328
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,713
That's where you found
the remote.

329
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,248
It's not--
it's not anywhere on me.

330
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,700
Well, when's the last time
you saw it?

331
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:35,468
I don't know,
but it couldn't have gone far.

332
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,837
I was in this area
pretty much the whole night.

333
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,172
You mean over the batter?

334
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,043
Both: No, no, no.
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

335
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,395
No, no, no, no, nothing,
nothing, nothing!

336
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,347
No, no, no, no, no!
Nothing, nothing, no!

337
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,399
It's not here, which means

338
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,685
it's in one of those
already-baked cupcakes.

339
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:55,020
Let's go. We have to start
pulling these apart.

340
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,273
Really? Come on,
don't be ridiculous.

341
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,993
Look, worst-case scenario,
one of the 1,000 cupcakes

342
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,161
has an earring in it.

343
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:03,279
We'll tell them
it's a surprise.

344
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:06,333
No, the worst-case scenario
is someone bites into it,

345
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:08,702
rips their lip open,
and sues us.

346
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:11,070
Let them sue us.
We don't have any money.

347
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:12,756
And that's why
we'll go to jail.

348
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,240
Yep, I'll be locked up raw

349
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:15,759
and forced to be
someone's girlfriend.

350
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,344
I mean, I'm a bad girlfriend
out of prison.

351
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:19,579
It's not gonna be any easier
with big Joan.

352
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:22,914
Calm down. If we go to prison,
I'll be your girlfriend.

353
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:24,517
Until someone hotter
comes along,

354
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,419
'cause that's the way it goes
in prison.

355
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:27,771
Start looking.

356
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,724
I am not going to smash
900 cupcakes.

357
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,525
Then we'll just have
to start over.

358
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:35,612
Oh, no, I would rather
hitch a ride West

359
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:37,930
and become a sister-wife.

360
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:42,118
This is crazy.
Can't I just text them

361
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,703
and tell them
we can't do the job?

362
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:46,439
No, you can't text them.
We need the money.

363
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:48,107
And stop with all the texting.

364
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:49,876
Maybe if you were thinking less
about texting

365
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:51,244
with my ex-boyfriend,

366
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:53,663
you wouldn't have lost
your earring in the first place.

367
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:55,081
You should have just said it.

368
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,584
You have a problem
with me texting Andy.

369
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,919
I do not have a problem
with it!

370
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:02,121
Oh, good,
'cause he's my friend too.

371
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:04,474
You'd think your loyalty
to your best friend

372
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:06,292
and business partner
would be more important

373
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:08,428
than some stupid
animal friendship!

374
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,230
- [Gasps]
- I mean...

375
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:11,931
I'm surprised I even have
to tell you that, Max.

376
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,099
It's kind of girl code.

377
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:16,434
Oh, I am way to tired
to hear "girl code."

378
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:19,789
Shut it down.

379
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,124
Girl code, Max.
Girl code.

380
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:28,329
Shut up, Caroline.
Shut up!

381
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,836
I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a response.

382
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,205
Yeah, that was
the goal, bitch.

383
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:37,290
I don't have time for this.

384
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,125
I have to find an earring
that you lost

385
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:41,327
in one of these
thousand cupcakes, bitch!

386
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,862
The thousand cupcakes that
you forgot to tell me about!

387
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,436
And the girl code
means that when a girl

388
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:50,753
breaks up with someone,

389
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:52,322
you don't interfere
with their boyfriend,

390
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:54,824
because she needs
some distance!

391
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:56,676
Well, why didn't you
tell me that

392
00:16:56,678 --> 00:17:00,011
when I asked you 14 hours ago?

393
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:03,865
Hey, Max.
I got your text.

394
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,952
I'm here to help.

395
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:09,287
Um, that was
a pre-girl-code text.

396
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:12,992
I thought we maybe
needed a backup

397
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:16,028
after Earl passed up
and I made Han cry.

398
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:24,268
Andy, on the list of things
I feel guilty about in life,

399
00:17:24,706 --> 00:17:26,389
calling you to help
in the middle of the night

400
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:27,507
is number two.

401
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:28,641
It would be number one
if I hadn't

402
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:29,809
pushed that girl
down the stairs

403
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:32,378
to get into the 98 Degrees
concert before her.

404
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,713
Well, it was 98 Degrees.
People had to die.

405
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:37,817
[Timer bell rings]

406
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:39,486
Okay, let's stop
all this joking and get down

407
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:40,687
to why I really came here.

408
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:42,489
Come on, Caroline, love me.

409
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:45,391
Did you just say,
"Caroline, love me"?

410
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:47,494
No, I said,
"Caroline, glove me."

411
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:48,661
[Scoffs]
What kind of loser would say,

412
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:51,996
"love me"?
Unless you do.

413
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,003
So how you doing?

414
00:17:57,005 --> 00:18:00,338
I'm okay.
A little tired.

415
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,959
You know, I've been
thinking about you a lot.

416
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:05,428
Pretty much all the time
since we broke up.

417
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,014
Um, maybe I overreacted
to your whole

418
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:10,249
obsession with work thing,
you know?

419
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,519
- Well, you are here
at 4:00 a.m.

420
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:15,388
'Cause I needed help making
1,000 cupcakes in four hours.

421
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,357
One might call that obsessive.

422
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,692
One might.
Or pretty much everyone might.

423
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:24,946
And, Andy, just know that
even though it didn't work out,

424
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,819
I do <i>glove</i> you.

425
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:31,988
I glove you too.

426
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,541
Now, get the cupcakes out
before they burn.

427
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:36,275
I don't have the energy
to do this all again.

428
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:39,610
Ah, there's the girl
I broke up with.

429
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,664
Everything's ready to go
out there.

430
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,166
I've had my hands
in more boxes tonight

431
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:46,336
than a gynecologist
at a free clinic.

432
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:49,671
[Laughter]

433
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:52,291
It's not <i>that</i> funny.

434
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:54,227
Stay up another 27 hours,

435
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:56,479
it'll be the funniest damn thing
you ever heard.

436
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:59,148
[Both chuckle]

437
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,767
Well, that's the end of it.

438
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:02,301
Yeah, I think it is.

439
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:04,771
Max, I'm talking about more
than the cupcakes.

440
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:08,106
Yeah, I could tell
by your Bradley Cooper tone.

441
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:09,976
So what, it's not gonna work out
between you two?

442
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:12,662
No. And I think
we have to break up.

443
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:14,113
I thought you already
broke up.

444
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:15,982
No, I'm talking about
you and me.

445
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,784
You're dumping <i>me?</i>

446
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:19,252
Wow, last guy who dumped me,

447
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:21,704
I burned down his house
and moved.

448
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:23,823
Still wanna continue
this conversation?

449
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:25,124
Max, it wouldn't work.

450
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:26,993
I would always be asking you
about Caroline.

451
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:28,678
Look, I get it, it's weird.

452
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,130
People don't usually stay
friends with their friend's ex,

453
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:34,465
but then, cats don't usually
become friends with dolphins.

454
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:38,504
But sometimes, for no
apparent reason, it happens.

455
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,440
Yeah, I just wish
I was as grown up

456
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,308
as a cat or a dolphin.

457
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,193
I hear ya.

458
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:45,862
So what's next, breakup text?

459
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:48,064
Nah, that's just gonna lead
to makeup text,

460
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:50,617
and then we're back
in a vicious cycle.

461
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,518
All right, I'll just
stop by your place,

462
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,903
pick up my CDs,
my T-shirts,

463
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:55,321
and the 3 grand I left there.

464
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:56,990
Max, you've never been
to my place.

465
00:19:56,992 --> 00:19:59,075
See, this is why
I'm breaking up with you--

466
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:01,044
you're a liar.

467
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,529
See you
in small claims court, bub.

468
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:09,699
Well, we did it, Max.
We made $4,000.

469
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:12,839
And as far as Andy and I go,

470
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:14,190
I think we're
in the right place,

471
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:15,975
because when he said
he'd been thinking about me

472
00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:17,376
since the breakup,

473
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:19,595
I realized I'd only been
thinking about the cupcakes.

474
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:22,565
Oh, please, God, shut up.

475
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,734
Thank you.
I was dying to shut up.

476
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:27,854
[Cell phone chimes]
Ooh.

477
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:30,239
Look, it's a text
from the place.

478
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:32,859
They loved the cupcakes.

479
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,861
Wait, why do I have your phone
in my apron?

480
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:37,613
No, my phone was in my apron.

481
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:39,916
Unless I handed you
the wrong apron

482
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:42,418
after I wiped them down.

483
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,438
What? <i>What?</i>

484
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,675
Oh... Your earring.

485
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:50,593
I had it in there
the whole time.

486
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:52,545
Oh, we're idiots!

487
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:55,880
We're two very different kinds
of idiots, but we're idiots.

488
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:58,551
And yet, somehow we work.

489
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:00,553
We're the most unlikely
animal friends.

490
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:03,056
I don't know about that,
but a picture of me nursing you

491
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,391
would definitely go viral.

492
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:08,344
- Good night.
- Good night.

493
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,445
Where you going?

494
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:10,697
I'm too tired
to pull my bed down.

495
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:12,615
- I'm sleeping with you.
- No, you're not.

496
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:14,867
You have super gonorrhea.

497
