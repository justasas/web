1
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:10,407
Wow! Bummer, dude.

2
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:12,042
You have a time machine?

3
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:15,012
And somehow, it got programmed
to this crap diner?

4
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:18,082
I must admit, I am
quite taken with steampunk.

5
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,050
Oh, steampunk, right.
I remember that trend.

6
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:22,618
It happened for,
like, ten seconds

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,588
back in 2000
and-are-you-kidding-me?

8
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,290
Dude, seriously,
you're sitting

9
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,092
in a public place
tap-tap-tapping

10
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:30,460
on an oldie typewriter?

11
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:32,095
What are you?

12
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:34,464
In the league of extraordinarily
pretentious gentlemen?

13
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:36,599
Aren't you being
a little aggressive?

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,200
Yup.

15
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:39,201
That's how people are
here in the present

16
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:40,702
where we live.

17
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:42,104
But don't get me wrong.

18
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:43,705
I'd like to go
back in time, too.

19
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:46,475
Maybe stop 9/11 or that creep
who had sex on my shoe,

20
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:47,942
but I can't.

21
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:51,079
Present?
Where's that uniform from?

22
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,647
Like, 1998?

23
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,448
Oh, stop,
or I'm going to have

24
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,117
to shoot you
with a Smith & Wesson

25
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:59,120
I'm currently packing
in my bloomers.

26
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:03,491
I'll go get thee a menu,
my good man.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

28
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,211
attention, everyone.

29
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,547
Max and I have a little
late-night treat for you.

30
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,382
Don't say it
all excited like that.

31
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,185
Now when it's not drugs,
Earl's going to be pissed.

32
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,554
You are invited
to a very important taste-test

33
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:30,721
of Max's homemade cupcakes.

34
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:32,590
Okay,
but I will have only one.

35
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,759
When I get a tummy,
single ladies call me Buddha

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,895
and rub me for luck.

37
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:40,565
I gotta watch out, too.

38
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,833
Last time I had Max's
chocolate espresso cupcake

39
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:43,933
before going home,

40
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:45,669
I was awake
till 5:00 A.M.,

41
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,872
hand washing all my thongs.

42
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:51,208
Thongs?
Earl, you devil.

43
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,377
That's right, just because
there's snow on the roof

44
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:55,945
doesn't mean there's
not swing in the sling.

45
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:59,015
Oh, Caroline, darling.
Can you go back over there?

46
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:00,783
I forgot my racing form.

47
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:04,420
Oh, horse racing?
It reminds me of Chestnut.

48
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:07,456
Max... Chestnut.

49
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:09,058
What's with the sad face?

50
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,760
Your horse is living it up
at a fancy stable nearby.

51
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:14,797
Not gone to the great stud farm
in the sky.

52
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:17,899
Did someone say
"stud farm"?

53
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,605
My fee is $10 a quart or $15
if you want a boy.

54
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,108
Wow.

55
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:29,777
You bounced back from your
Sophie breakup pretty quick.

56
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:31,245
It was not
a real breakup.

57
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:33,380
I will have her
very soon again.

58
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:35,583
Right now, I lay low
and wait in bushes

59
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:38,619
like determined jungle cat.

60
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:42,556
Or a rapist.

61
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:45,158
Racing forms,
here you go.

62
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,627
Earl,
maybe some time

63
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:48,127
you will take me out
to the track with you.

64
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,396
I used to ride horses
all the time in Korea.

65
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:51,964
The mechanical ones
for a quarter

66
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,833
in front of
supermarkets?

67
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:56,269
Actually, Max,
I'm a very good rider.

68
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,471
In fact, I was training
to be a jockey

69
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:00,906
but was too short.

70
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:04,243
Too short
to be a jockey?

71
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:06,945
That's a hard hit,
my man.

72
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:09,548
Han, I had no idea
you loved horses, too.

73
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,316
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

74
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,585
Well, why didn't you ever ask
about any of my interests?

75
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:15,254
I'll tell you why.

76
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,155
Because all you ever talk about
is "our cupcake business,"

77
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,523
our cupcake business."

78
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:20,858
Doesn't your cd
have other tracks?

79
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,426
Anyway,
our cupcake business

80
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:24,328
has a very important
meeting tomorrow

81
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,530
with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

82
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,998
I know
a party planner, too.

83
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,334
He sells J .Lo.
and Salma Hayek Pinatas

84
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,670
off back of truck
for Cinco de Mayo.

85
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,472
Awesome.
Put me down for a Hayek.

86
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:38,007
More storage space
for candy.

87
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,877
Well, our party planner
is <i>the</i> it guy in Manhattan.

88
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:42,178
And tomorrow,
Max and I are doing

89
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:43,680
a tasting for him
at his office.

90
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:48,851
How can someone be too short
to be a jockey?

91
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:50,820
Isn't that
the whole point?

92
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:54,290
Are you all right, Max?

93
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,957
I got here
as fast as I could.

94
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,693
Caroline texted me
to hurry over

95
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:59,495
because you didn't know
you were pregnant,

96
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:00,796
and you were giving
birth over toilet.

97
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:04,633
So I grabbed
my plunger and ran!

98
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:07,902
That is insane.
I never texted that.

99
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:11,406
No, I did,
when I stole your phone.

100
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,641
I needed a reason
to get Sophie over here.

101
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:15,643
I can't believe
she believed it.

102
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:18,179
Oh, come on, Max.
Giving birth over toilet?

103
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,649
That is very you.

104
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,917
Now that you are here,
Sophie, sit.

105
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,019
I want to tell you
something important.

106
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,887
Well, you can forget that.

107
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:29,656
There's no way
I'm going to stay.

108
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:33,092
A cupcake party?

109
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:36,830
Oh, look, and this one
even has a pretzel in it.

110
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:38,865
Yup, that's
our "salty n' spice"

111
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,433
for our more
adventurous customers.

112
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:42,735
Also for
the uptight white people,

113
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:44,537
we have
the very, very vanilla

114
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:48,073
which is... big surprise...
My favorite.

115
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,209
And this is our beer-batter
maple bacon

116
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,010
spring break cupcake.

117
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:56,614
That's for stoners,
and big surprise, my favorite.

118
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:59,262
Well, I have
some big news

119
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,464
I want to share with you
all as well.

120
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:04,467
Sophie, that classy lady
right over there...

121
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:08,872
Mm, I like this one.

122
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,207
She recently
broke it off with me

123
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,641
because she wanted
to be with a man

124
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:14,810
who had a dream
and a drive.

125
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:17,246
So I have bought
a drive...

126
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,114
A Lincoln town car.

127
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:22,217
Yes, I have a new car service
and slogan:

128
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:26,854
"Lie back and I will ride you
till you tell me to stop."

129
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:32,960
So, oleg, you now have
a town car business?

130
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:35,796
And Sophie,
you rent town cars all the time.

131
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:37,731
Oh, oh, please.

132
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:40,301
I mean, I love pizza, too,
but that doesn't mean

133
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:43,870
I have to marry papa John.

134
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:48,641
I was just thinking,
you might want to come out back

135
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:52,478
and take a look at the light-up
makeup mirror on visors.

136
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,082
Light-up makeup mirror?

137
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,784
Oh, I might be interested.

138
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:00,986
But not just you and I.

139
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,188
Han will come as well.

140
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:06,258
Finally! Han is getting
invited to something.

141
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,193
Other than LinkedIn.

142
00:06:08,194 --> 00:06:10,930
- So much for the taste test.
- It's fine.

143
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:12,798
I know what's best
for our cupcake business.

144
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,565
I do say that a lot,

145
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:16,200
but I think
it's kind of charming.

146
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,268
I'll go get our coats.

147
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:20,438
Mm, mm, mm.
Look at you.

148
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,607
I must say, I'm impressed
with how far you've come.

149
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:25,276
Well, you burn
a few thousand cupcakes,

150
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:26,544
you're bound
to get better.

151
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,679
Not just the cupcakes, Max.

152
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,280
Look how far <i>you've</i> come.

153
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:31,982
When I think of that girl
who came in here

154
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:33,283
just looking to get by...

155
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:35,385
Hey, and check you out now.

156
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:38,989
Big, fancy meeting in Manhattan.
Lordy lord!

157
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,058
- It's only a meeting, Earl.
- Maybe.

158
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:43,560
But if you were
one of these horses,

159
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:48,164
I'd put all
of my money on you, Max.

160
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:49,832
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

161
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,300
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

162
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:53,202
Paul Platt parties.
Please hold.

163
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,770
Poor kid.

164
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,972
If I had that job,
I'd be asking someone

165
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:58,074
to please hold a gun
to my head.

166
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,476
He's probably excited
to be working for Paul Platt.

167
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:01,843
Look at
all these magazines

168
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:04,045
calling him
the next Martha Stewart.

169
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:06,247
Someday, we'll have
articles about us.

170
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,748
You know,
pictures of you and me

171
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:08,749
standing outside
our country home.

172
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,318
Hold on.

173
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,055
We're rich and still
living together?

174
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:16,224
Okay, she's leaving.
This is us.

175
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,891
About time.

176
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:19,793
Been sitting here so long
my ass is asleep,

177
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:23,197
which kind of goes against
my theory that it won't quit.

178
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:25,599
Hi, Paul's going to be
a little longer.

179
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,766
It's fine.
It's just...

180
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,268
Paul Platt parties,
please hold.

181
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:29,436
- Paul Platt parties...
- How much longer...

182
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:32,439
- Please hold.
- Me or them?

183
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,474
I got the ass
pins and needles.

184
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,876
- Max.
- What? We're on hold.

185
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:39,912
Have a seat.
Five more minutes.

186
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:42,482
Paul Platt parties.

187
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:43,716
The word "party"
at a party planner's?

188
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:45,251
Little obvious.

189
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:49,954
Like me having art that says
"will die alone."

190
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:51,589
Wait.

191
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,625
I think this is Johnny's art.
No way.

192
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:56,194
"No way" is right.
Johnny's a nobody.

193
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:58,430
Paul Platt wouldn't have
a framed "Johnny" in his office.

194
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:01,033
Look, signed "j. Peg."
That's his tag.

195
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:03,001
Yo, what's the deal
with this art?

196
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:04,536
It's a street artist.

197
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:05,602
Everyone's getting
really into him now.

198
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:07,138
Oh, yeah?

199
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,642
He was trying to get into me
a few months ago.

200
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:13,277
It was more emotional
than that.

201
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:15,212
He cheated on
his girlfriend with her

202
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:16,480
and then blew her off.

203
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,482
It was really hard
for us.

204
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,284
And you thought
me slapping my ass

205
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:23,153
in front of him
was inappropriate?

206
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:26,722
- Wow, Johnny made it.
- Well, good for him.

207
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,358
He's making it,
we're making it...

208
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,659
We're making it?

209
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,062
I magic-markered
over the scuffs on my boot,

210
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:33,563
and we can't
even get past

211
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:36,799
the poor man's John Cusack
over there.

212
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,034
Max, we <i>are</i> making it.

213
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,635
We've come a long way.

214
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:41,836
We haven't used
Starbucks napkins

215
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,106
for toilet paper
in months.

216
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,674
And now,
look where we are.

217
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:48,177
We've got a meeting
with Paul Platt.

218
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,512
Say it:
"We're making it."

219
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,314
I'm serious.
Say it, Max.

220
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:53,414
We are making it.

221
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,015
Okay, we're making it.

222
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:58,519
- Caroline channing.
- This is us!

223
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,090
- Ahh.
- What, five more minutes?

224
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,192
Monday at 4:00.
Something came up.

225
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:06,327
Oh, okay.
Well, Monday at 4:00.

226
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,028
There's no Monday at 4:00.

227
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,163
He said Monday at 4:00.
Monday at 4:00, right?

228
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:12,031
Absolutely.
Monday at 4:00.

229
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:14,601
There is no Monday at 4:00.

230
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:17,104
I'm confused.
Is there a Monday at 4:00?

231
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:19,473
In the books, Monday at 4:00.
Paul can't wait.

232
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:22,075
There is
no Monday at 4:00.

233
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:25,044
I don't understand.
Are we coming in Monday at 4:00?

234
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,045
Absolutely.
Paul's a big fan.

235
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:30,149
Don't come in on Monday.

236
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,618
Can you please tell me
what's going on?

237
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:35,721
See, it's this news
about your father being moved

238
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:38,491
to a cushy white collar
prison this week.

239
00:09:38,492 --> 00:09:40,259
Paul can't have anything to do
with someone named channing,

240
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,060
'cause everyone
in New York is pissed.

241
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:46,498
Look at all that.
It never stops.

242
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,299
How much more of this
do I have to take?

243
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,700
So we'll see you
on Monday!

244
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:52,203
Don't come.

245
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:54,539
I woke my ass up
for this?

246
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:02,056
Mmm.
This was delicious, Max.

247
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:04,425
Here's a $20.
Keep the change.

248
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:05,894
What are you doing,
Sophie?

249
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:07,495
You don't pay
for the cupcakes.

250
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:09,097
No, take it
for your business.

251
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:12,432
Ever since your big
party planner meeting went bust,

252
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,934
I was worried
that you two girls

253
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,636
might form
a joint suicide pact.

254
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:22,109
Nah, we're
not that organized.

255
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,611
So how's Caroline today?

256
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,712
She's handling it all
better than I thought.

257
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,214
She's with her father's
lawyer right now,

258
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:29,982
trying to figure out
the best time for her

259
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:31,784
to go out to the prison
to see him before he's moved.

260
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:36,222
Oh, that is my new phone.

261
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:40,960
You know there's a phone
stuck to that gay furby, right?

262
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:44,529
Yes, this is from my
favorite store on 14th street,

263
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,697
rhinestoned.

264
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,866
Oh, it's just a text
from my driver.

265
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,268
He's waiting out front.

266
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:52,503
Why don't you
just invite oleg inside?

267
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm not sure yet
he deserves to come inside.

268
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:58,642
Well, from what I heard,
he's already come inside.

269
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:04,181
Oh, Max, I love it
when you're dirty!

270
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:06,183
Hey, how'd it go?

271
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:07,884
Well, according
to my father's lawyer,

272
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,020
the prison is surrounded
by so much press

273
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:11,288
that daddy doesn't want me
to come out there

274
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:12,756
and be exploited
all over again.

275
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,458
Why is he still
the only news story out there?

276
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,927
Well, the good news is,

277
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,997
your hair
is especially shiny today.

278
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:23,099
It is?
Thanks, Sophie.

279
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,901
So try not
to kill yourself.

280
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:29,339
Well, if I didn't kill myself
reading these in the car,

281
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,440
I won't.
Hate mail.

282
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,641
It was being held
at my old P.O. box.

283
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,078
My father's lawyer
picked it up for me.

284
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,880
Why didn't he just punch you
in the face and call it a day?

285
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,083
I know, it's like the end of
<i>miracle on 34th street,</i>

286
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:43,618
only everyone's
calling me a bitch.

287
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,021
Oh, come on, not everyone
is calling you a bitch.

288
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:50,591
"Dear bitch,
I hate you."

289
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:54,094
"If I ever see you
on the street, I will..."

290
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,329
Shake your hand
and wish you well,

291
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,632
as you have been through
so very much.

292
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,333
That is not
what that says.

293
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:01,835
It might be.

294
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:02,970
It's hard to read
his actual words,

295
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,671
as they are
written in blood.

296
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:08,775
Oh, look how fancy.
This is not hate mail.

297
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:13,880
No, this is invitation to
metropolitan museum annual gala.

298
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:15,481
It is?

299
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:18,050
This is my favorite social event
in all of New York.

300
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:20,553
I've gone every year
since I was 18.

301
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:21,821
It's a fashion ball
at the museum of art...

302
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:23,489
Yeah, I know
what it is.

303
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,491
- I catered it last year.
- Max, how weird.

304
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:27,559
We were probably
right in the very same room.

305
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,629
Then there's a good chance
I spit in your drink.

306
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,532
Not really, unless you were
acting all prissy and demanding.

307
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,867
There's a good chance
you spit in my drink.

308
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:39,571
Well, see?
This is happy news.

309
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,205
No, as much as I want to,
I can't go.

310
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,574
Everybody hates me.

311
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:46,209
And much worse,
I have nothing to wear,

312
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,346
and if you're gonna be hated,
you better look damn good.

313
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:53,216
I give up. That invitation
finally broke me.

314
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:55,118
Why are you
pulling down your bed?

315
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:57,320
Because I don't have
a door to slam.

316
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,155
Hell, I don't even
have a door!

317
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,190
Everything's
been taken away, Max...

318
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:03,225
My fortune,
my business career,

319
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:05,595
my social life,
my sweet, sweet horse.

320
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,997
Okay, take a nap.
You're upset.

321
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:09,198
You have
a good reason to be.

322
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,067
<i>A</i> good reason?

323
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:14,836
I say she has
200, 300 good reasons.

324
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,171
I mean, read these.

325
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:19,174
These are like
letters to the devil.

326
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:23,244
I'm just going to get in there
and never get out.

327
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,346
Close it up, Max.
Put me in the wall.

328
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,749
No, it's really hard to
close it when you're in there.

329
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,350
I've tried.

330
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,719
Look, I know
it's not even remotely close

331
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,054
to what you had before,

332
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,622
but we do have
our cupcake business

333
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:38,893
and our purple stove,
and we do have $922.

334
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:40,260
And we're gonna make it.

335
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:44,264
Wall me.

336
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:49,703
Come on, all you need
is a big, glamorous party.

337
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,638
I mean, look at
all the celebrities

338
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,708
that are on the list:
Martha Stewart,

339
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,576
Justin Timberlake...

340
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:59,445
Ooh, Hugh Jackman!

341
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:01,581
Oh, I like to call him
"huge" Jackman,

342
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:04,316
because I bet
he has a big penis.

343
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:08,053
Wall me.

344
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:17,795
Thank you, sir.

345
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:20,030
Welcome home, buddy.

346
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:22,165
As you can see,
we haven't put the pool in yet.

347
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,667
We'll get to it.

348
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:26,637
Tree, grill, shovel...
Usual cast of characters.

349
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:29,106
Now, I am going
to take you in to her,

350
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:30,507
but I should warn you.

351
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:32,743
She hasn't been
out of bed for two days,

352
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:35,811
and that means no tooth brushing
and it's bad up in there.

353
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:37,647
I'm pretty sure horses
have a keen sense of smell,

354
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:39,148
so just be prepared.

355
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:43,819
I missed you, too.

356
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:50,792
Max, I'm trying to sleep.
Take your boots off.

357
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:53,161
Caroline,
I have something for you.

358
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:56,330
Go away.
I'm dead.

359
00:14:56,331 --> 00:15:00,434
Jeez, and you said
my breath was bad.

360
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:02,937
You have a visitor,
someone you love.

361
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:09,543
Chestnut!
Chestnut, hi, baby, hi.

362
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:11,278
How did he get here?

363
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,813
I went to peach
and told her

364
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:14,014
it was a matter
of life and death

365
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,515
and we had
to have him back.

366
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,551
And what,
she just gave him back to you?

367
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:20,320
Well, I did have to agree
to come back and babysit

368
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:22,322
one day a week
for the rest of my life,

369
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:24,523
but hell, Chestnut's home.

370
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:27,226
Max, thank you so much.
You brought me back to life.

371
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,861
Oh, my God,
don't exhale on me.

372
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,463
Your breath is like you
went down on a brussels sprout.

373
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,700
Tip your head that way.

374
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:36,135
Chestnut, Chestnut.

375
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,037
Don't breathe
on him either!

376
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:41,073
His whole head is a nose.
He can't handle that.

377
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:44,810
Chestnut's home.

378
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,494
Hey, Earl.
Long time, no see.

379
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:53,064
Well, well, well,
Johnny.

380
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,999
If it isn't
the famous street artist.

381
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,434
Well, I'm hardly famous.

382
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:57,735
You got that right.

383
00:15:57,736 --> 00:16:01,238
My remark was
laced with sarcasm.

384
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,774
Can you tell Max
I'm here?

385
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:06,777
That depends.
Are you still a two-timing bum?

386
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:10,047
That's his name,
don't wear it out.

387
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,448
Hiya, slugger.

388
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:14,517
Can you do me a favor
and call Earl off?

389
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,987
I may be on day six
of my p90x,

390
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:19,922
but I'm in no shape to take on
a heavyweight like him.

391
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:22,658
It's okay, Earl, we're cool.

392
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:25,094
Well, I am.
He's just riding my fumes.

393
00:16:25,095 --> 00:16:27,262
So, uh,
where's your section?

394
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:31,896
- Counter.
- Hm, same ol', same ol'.

395
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:36,270
Johnny's in the diner.

396
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,607
Why is he here?
It can't be to eat.

397
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:41,476
He's "made it."
He eats "made it food" now.

398
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:44,045
Well, obviously,
he's here to see you.

399
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,581
Or else he won the award for
biggest lying jerk in New York,

400
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,984
and this is the first stop
on his press tour.

401
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:49,985
Well, I don't know
why he's here,

402
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:51,685
but you better
come with me.

403
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:53,721
He looks really good,
so I'm not listening

404
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,356
to a thing coming out of
his pretty mouth.

405
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,727
Well, I was gonna
ask what the specials were,

406
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,394
but you know what?
Can I actually just get

407
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,763
one of Max's
homemade cupcakes?

408
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:05,766
- Okay, which flavor?
- Surprise me.

409
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:08,534
Kind of like how you surprised
her with your girlfriend?

410
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:11,671
Okay, I'm starting
to get a vibe here,

411
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:13,640
and that's why I came in,
because I feel bad,

412
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,175
the way things
went down between us,

413
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:18,577
and I came to say good-bye
because I'm moving.

414
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,579
Oh, moving.
To where?

415
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,248
- Manhattan.
- Manhattan?

416
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,383
That hardly calls
for a good-bye speech.

417
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,385
It's over there.

418
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,521
Yeah, I know,
but it's a big change for me,

419
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:30,588
and we're not going
to be rolling

420
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,257
in the same circles
anymore,

421
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:36,594
and I'm getting married...
Over there.

422
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:39,263
Well, at least you and
your girlfriend worked it out.

423
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:40,631
Actually, we broke up.

424
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:43,868
This is someone
I met a couple months ago.

425
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,170
I was only
watching his lips,

426
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:51,975
but did they just say
what I think they said?

427
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:54,577
Well, there's your cupcake.
That'll be $5.

428
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:58,048
The price has gone up.
Yeah, we're successful now.

429
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,051
In fact, we may be working
with Martha Stewart.

430
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:03,318
Caroline knows her
from, you know, before.

431
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,453
We're gonna talk it over
with her

432
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:08,123
at the met gala ball
that Caroline got invited to.

433
00:18:08,124 --> 00:18:10,225
Martha's on the committee.
Caroline goes every year.

434
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,027
Not a big deal.

435
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,929
My first time.
Not a big deal either.

436
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,330
In fact, none of it's
a big deal,

437
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,632
just two girls
who are making it

438
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:21,235
but who choose to stay
in Brooklyn 'cause we're cool.

439
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:23,604
That's awesome, Max.
That's awesome.

440
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:25,173
It's just funny,
because whenever I think of you,

441
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:29,476
I think of you in this diner
in that uniform.

442
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:31,212
In a good way.

443
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,316
You want money now?

444
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,251
Yeah.
It's business.

445
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:41,054
It's not like we had
a relationship or anything.

446
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:42,455
In fact,
you can pay Caroline.

447
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,490
She's the money.
I'm the artist.

448
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,763
You know, I'm doing pretty
well as an artist myself.

449
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:51,663
I've been selling
a lot of my stuff.

450
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,766
Really?
We hadn't heard.

451
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,667
And there's your cupcake.

452
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,070
In case you didn't notice,
that container's to go.

453
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,805
Got it.

454
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,175
He's gone.
I got rid of him.

455
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,444
Max?

456
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,911
What are you doing?

457
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,948
Punching cheesecakes.

458
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,350
It's my version
of going to bed for two days.

459
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,584
Are you more upset
about the marriage thing

460
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,754
or the uniform thing?

461
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,022
Oh, this isn't about Johnny.
I'm mad at the cheesecakes.

462
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,457
They were supposed
to have cherries on top,

463
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,526
and I wanted cherries!

464
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:26,529
Why not me?

465
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,767
Okay, maybe it's half
no cherries, half Johnny.

466
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,902
Nothing ever
does work out for us.

467
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,904
And then I hear myself saying
all that ridiculous stuff

468
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:36,173
about us talking
to Martha Stewart at the gala.

469
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,808
I mean, what was that?
It's insane.

470
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,976
Is it?

471
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,111
Wait, seriously, is it?

472
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:44,613
Or is it just insane enough
to be genius?

473
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:47,283
Max, we have the invitation.
She'll be there.

474
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:48,818
Why are we wasting our time
with Paul Platt

475
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,253
when we can
meet the real thing?

476
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,988
We can take Martha
our best cupcake,

477
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:53,455
explain our situation,

478
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:55,456
and maybe...
Maybe she'll talk to us.

479
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:57,292
I mean, she was a girl
with a dream once, too,

480
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:00,962
and she certainly
understands hard times.

481
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:03,899
You are talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart.

482
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,735
I am talking about us
stalking Martha Stewart!

483
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:10,805
I even have my gorgeous Judith
leiber jeweled cupcake purse

484
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,739
to smuggle the cupcake in.
It's perfect.

485
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,209
I knew there was a reason
I took that from the townhouse.

486
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,578
Great, you have a cupcake
and a cupcake purse.

487
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,848
What else are we gonna
wear to the ball, cinderella?

488
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,018
Are the rats in the alley gonna
whip us up some ball gowns?

489
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:26,486
I mean, it's not exactly
like we have a fairy godmother.

490
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,922
Hey, look, girls!

491
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:34,928
I got myself a crown
and a wand at rhinestoned.

492
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,564
I'll have the soup
in my booth.

493
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:44,704
Well, this is as close
to a fairytale

494
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:47,272
as you and I are ever gonna get,
so what the hell?

495
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:48,774
Max, does that mean
we're gonna find

496
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,075
a way to go to the ball?

497
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:52,878
Oh, yeah.
Get your cupcake on,

498
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:56,682
'cause we're gonna
get balled.

499
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,620
Sophie, this is
so generous of you

500
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,521
to offer to buy us dresses
for the gala,

501
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:37,457
but as much as my shoes
love being back

502
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,593
- in their place of birth...
- Oh, your shoes were born here?

503
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:43,395
Mine were born in China,
but I adopted them at payless.

504
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:45,030
Maybe we should
find something cheaper,

505
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:46,732
at one of
those consignment stores.

506
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:49,401
"Consignment stores"?

507
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:51,637
Come on,
what are we, gypsies?

508
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:55,440
This is big fancy ball.
We need ball gowns.

509
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:57,442
Never really been
a fan of balls.

510
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:59,043
In fact, always thought
they got in the way,

511
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,812
but here we are.

512
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:02,614
Well, we do have
to look amazing

513
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:04,649
if we're approaching
Martha Stewart with a cupcake,

514
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,417
so we'll find
a way to pay you back

515
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,920
and start by doing some
cleaning jobs for you for free.

516
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:12,924
No! Every year
I give money to charity,

517
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,391
and I like
you two girls

518
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:17,828
way more than the babies
with the broken smiles.

519
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:21,164
So don't worry.
I got plenty of cash.

520
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:23,734
Aww, a roll of hundreds.

521
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:26,970
Reminds me of my Christmas
stocking stuffers.

522
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,906
Yeah, this is fun day.

523
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:33,609
I'm like Richard Gere
and you're my two hookers.

524
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,144
Well, when you put it
like that,

525
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm a little
more comfortable.

526
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:40,049
Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

527
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,985
Hi, how are you?
We don't have a lot of time.

528
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,586
We have to be
at work by 6:00.

529
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:46,821
Can you show us your best
formal spring couture?

530
00:22:46,822 --> 00:22:50,091
Perhaps you ladies
might be more comfortable

531
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:51,592
down in ready-to-wear.

532
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:53,695
As I said,
we're in a bit of a rush.

533
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,764
We might move a little quicker
if you dropped the attitude

534
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:58,199
and picked up
some dresses.
