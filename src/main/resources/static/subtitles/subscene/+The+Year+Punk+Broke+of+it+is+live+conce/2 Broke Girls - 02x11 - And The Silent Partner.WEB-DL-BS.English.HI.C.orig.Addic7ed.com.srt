she might come in.

Yeah, keep walking, ugly!

00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:16,157
Ugly?
She's like a supermodel.

7
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:17,942
Did she come in
and buy something?

8
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:20,278
- No.
- Then, she ugly.

00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,163
Okay, yes, business is slow,

10
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:24,365
but we don't
have to drop to that level.

11
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:27,169
Ooh, this guy
is definitely coming in.

to Max's homemade cupcakes!

Hello.
How much are your cupcakes?

17
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,049
$4.

18
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:42,319
No.

from Max's Homemade Cupcakes

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,154
to acquaint you with our new
"Mornings with Max's" special.

The money Sophie gave us
to open the shop

Wait, we already have
next month's rent?

43
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:52,928
Why are we worried?
We're doing better

44

Well, well, well,

a personalized hello from Earl.

just forgot your name.

Why? You haven't even
eaten here yet.

No, I'm nervous.

something kind of big.

What? You have
a secret family on Long Island?

- You have Hep-C? "D"?

- One of the new heps?
- No.

I'm in love with her

you tell someone "I love you."

why shouldn't I say it?

she'd be all over that.

she's very, very depressed.

in that hair net?

her new house,
there was no house.

I know what it feels like
to be ripped off.

I once bought a Fendi purse,
but when I looked inside,

111

it said "Rendi."

with that.

We should stop by after work,
see how she is,

115

and bring her
some of her favorite cupcakes.

that money as a gift.

Sophie gave us was a gift?

123
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,140
Yes. She gave it to us
to support our dream.

124
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:27,125
I know when I had money,
I gave it out freely,

125
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,261
and never expected
anything in return.

126
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,013
Like when I gave my maid
that gorgeous Rendi.

127
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:35,233
Well, I don't know about
people not expecting stuff back.

128
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,801
One time,
a guy bought me a slushy,

129
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,437
and for the next three weeks,
he owned me.

130
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,307
No, he really owned me.

131
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:46,077
Eight days in, I almost
got traded to a trucker.

132
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,947
And I wouldn't
even mention her gift.

133
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,982
It will only insult her,
and I promise,

134
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,503
nobody is expecting us
to give the money back.

135
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:57,822
Come in, girls.
Did you bring the check?

136
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,492
No, because it was a gift--
a big-ass gift,

137
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,213
but we brought our love
and we brought cupcakes.

138

traditionally served

141

wronged by their contractors.

But that's not
the worst thing.

144
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:24,065
She is so depressed, no sex,

145
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,700
which is big problem for me,

146
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:29,905

paid for a drink in six years?

are here to see you.

but still a gift.

Are we sure about that?
'Cause I was slushy boy's bitch

and I did things.

Look,
Max brought you cupcakes,

159
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:10,946
your favorite: Vanilla
with a bacon fat drizzle.

160
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:15,166
No, I can't eat
when I've been betrayed.

161
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,953
What kind again?

162
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:21,706
Sophie, I am patient man,
but I am also horny man.

163
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,209
Any idea when you will
snap out of this?

164
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:28,079
Oh, why don't you just unzip
and climb on top of me now

165
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,764
and get it over with?

166
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:31,766
- Oh, no.
- Well, we should be going.

167
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:33,635
No, girls, stay.

168
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:37,355
If she's not even going to
put up a fight, what's the fun?

169
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,274
Are you sure?

170
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:42,027
Bacon drizzle,
little bit of heaven.

171
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,112
No, I don't want them.

172
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:46,097
Okay,
let's put the cupcakes here,

173
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,899
in case you change your mind.

174
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,619
- Is this a gun?
- Ooh!

175
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:54,456
Yes. I'm not going to
stab myself to death.

176
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,626
Do you know how much
this outfit costs?

177
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:59,610
Sophie, you're going to
get through this.

178
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,297
And by the way,
you look amazing in black.

179
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:05,834
Oh, well, no more
bright colors for me now.

180
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:07,886
I'm in mourning.

181
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:11,890
See?
Black bra, black garters,

182
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,192
and look, black panties.

183
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,979
Um, you're not wearing
any panties.

184
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:20,631
I'm not?

185
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,017
Oh.

186
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,403
I'm sorry about
that wild mess down there.

187
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,491
Sophie, I feel bad
you got ripped off.

188
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:33,144
Here are all my tips
from tonight: $27.

189
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,863
For eight hours?

190
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:38,950
Oh, now,
I'm depressed for you.

191
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,569
You want to borrow my gun?

192
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,238
You know what? I think
you just need to eat something,

193
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,907
and pretty soon,
you'll be back to your old self:

194
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,910
A woman who gives gifts
and expects nothing in return,

195
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,597
'cause that's what a gift is.

196
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:57,018
Sophie, is that
doing anything for you?

197
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,138
Yeah, well, I'm not hating it.

198
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,358
Here, this soup
smells amazing.

199
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,643
Oh, no. I don't have
the energy to eat.

200
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,047
Sophie, open your mouth
and put this in.

201
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:13,234
Oh, come on.
Now you're as bad as Oleg.

202
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,469
There. Better?

203
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,455
That's cold.

204
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,409
Sophie, just say the word,
and I will rob a bank for you.

205
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:23,294
Sophie, I understand
you're hurting,

206
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,580
but we've already spent
most of the money on the shop,

207
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:28,132
and business just isn't good.

208
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,386
It's not the money.
Everybody thinks it's the money.

209
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:32,920
It's more than that.

210
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:36,140
My lake house was my dream,
and I lost my dream.

211
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,475
Oh, thank God!

212
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,644
Well, I'm glad
that's cleared up.

213
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,312
Not about the money.

214
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,898
Max, come on, she's had a shock,
we should let her sleep.

215
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,268
You girls are so lucky.
You still have your dream.

216
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,904
Well, Sophie, what if you
were part of our dream?

217
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:51,406
I'm sorry?
Whose dream?

218
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:52,774
Our dream.

219
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:56,477
Your dream?
Where's that cupcake?

220
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,146
Look, Sophie's the only reason
we have a shop.

221
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:00,498
We should make her,
like, a partner.

222
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,834
Mmm! Partner!

223
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,952
But you and I
are already partners.

224
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,921
I feel like we're kind of
partnered out.

225
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,623
What about a silent partner?

226
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:12,159
Mmm! Silent partner!
Yeah, I like that.

227
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:15,463
Mmm! I'm getting
my appetite back,

228
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:18,466
and also, my sex drive.

229
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,687
Go or stay, girls.
Either way, I'm going in.

230
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:34,469
Look I'm sorry I said Sophie
could be part of the store.

231
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:36,605
I just felt bad for her,
lying there,

232
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:41,242
all in black, too sad
to even make her junk pretty.

233
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:44,763
It's fine. "Silent partner" is
just a figurehead role anyway,

234
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:47,299
and it's nice to know
you have such a big heart.

235
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,533
It's not my heart.

236
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:50,753
What I saw down there
changed me.

237
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,255
It looks like something
an animal built

238
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:56,658
to live in for the winter.

239
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:06,384
Wait, what is
Sophie's chandelier doing here?

240
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,903
Is this the Polish version
of a home invasion?

241
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:11,873
They break in
and leave something tacky?

242
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,059
Good morning, partners.

243
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:19,197
I didn't know the dress code,
so I went business casual.

244
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:24,452
Look, the chandelier that
I bought for my lake house.

245
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:26,654
Oh, now our dreams
are together.

246
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:30,208
Sophie, it's not
the look we were going for.

247
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,046
Oh, I know.
Much better, right?

248
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:36,614
That is definitely
not our style.

249
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:40,568
It looks like a Tim Burton movie
just spit up in here.

250
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,320
I think it's kind of pretty.

251
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:43,822
But what do I know?

252
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:47,158
I once spent my last 50 bucks
on a frog pinata.

253
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,360
Had to have it.

254
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,162
[Phone ringing]

255
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:52,914
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

256
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,550
Yes, we're
an upscale bakery, and--

257
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:57,919
Now, we sell hoagies.

258
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,889
Oh, no, no, no, sir,
we do not sell hoagies.

259
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:02,557
Yes, we do.

260
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,477
How many would you like?
Let me get a pen.

261
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,096
[Knocking at the door]

262
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:12,267
What's happening?

263
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:15,052
Are we finally
gonna trash Caroline?

264
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:16,404
No, I need your help.

265
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:17,939
I watched four chick flicks
back-to-back,

266
00:12:17,941 --> 00:12:19,324
then I made a list
of possible ways

267
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,742
to tell Caroline I love her.

268
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:24,696
I was gonna make more,
but I got my period.

269
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,001
Okay, run the choices past me.

270
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:32,036
Whichever one makes me
want to hurl the most,

271
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:33,838
that's your winner.

272
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,957
I could play a song for her
outside of her apartment,

273
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,294
but keep in mind how hard it is
to find a boom box in 2012.

274
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:41,579
Yeah, plus, if you do that
outside our apartment,

275
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,248
you'll be shot.

276
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,366
By me.

277
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:48,553
Okay, what about
sharing cocoa and a hot dog

278
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:50,254
on the ice rink
in Central Park?

279
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:51,556
Yup, that's it.

280
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:52,974
Makes me
want to take my head off

281
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:54,225
and throw it into the street.

282
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:56,561
Cool.
Oh, and, Max,

283
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:58,179
I think I'm the only
straight guy on earth

284
00:12:58,181 --> 00:12:59,881
who knows the difference
between Dylan McDermott

285
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:03,401
and Dermott Mulroney,
and that, my friend, is love.

286
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,722
Oh, what's
that funky-ass smell?

287
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:11,292
Do they finally sell
pepperoni febreze?

288
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:13,861
Max, this already
isn't working.

289
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:16,447
The stinky salami,
the gaudy chandelier?

290
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:19,417
It's like a haunted Quiznos
in here.

291
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,553
Hey, I'm sending Oleg
to Queens

292
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:25,423
to pick up
a flat of Fresca. Yeah.

293
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,025
There's nothing better
with a hoagie

294
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:29,093
than an ice-cold Fresca.

295
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:31,629
That's what I wanted!

296
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:33,514
Look...

297
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:37,134
They'll go great
with the pickled eggs!

298
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,273
This just went from my dream
to a nightmare.

299
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:44,993
Oh, my God, Caroline!
It is you!

300
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:47,946
Stacy, no way! I haven't
seen you since graduation.

301
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:49,631
We went to Wharton together.

302
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,666
This girl is a genius.

303
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,534
- [Chuckles]
- Always top of the class.

304
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,119
So what are you doing here?

305
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,989
Buying a cupcake on your way
to running the world?

306
00:13:57,991 --> 00:13:59,841
No, I own this shop.

307
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:03,544
Oh. You own
this little cupcake shop?

308
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:06,681
And many other bigger shops.

309
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:08,933
This is our
new Williamsburg location.

310
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:11,052
And yes, I know,
the chandelier is all wrong.

311
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:12,770
I told the designer,
none of our

312
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:15,673
Pacific Northwest locations
will have the chandeliers.

313
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:19,310
Of course, you'd own
a cupcake empire at 25.

314
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:22,146
- Oh, and this is Max.
- Hi.

315
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:25,984
I just transferred
from our Boise location.

316
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:29,537
What's that horrible smell?

317
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,323
It's something called
a "hoagie."

318
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:35,076
The workers like them.
Right, Max?

319
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:40,031
<i>Si, gracias por la</i> hoagie.

320
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,299
Well, I have to go.

321
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:43,367
I'm consulting upstairs
at BBD&L.

322
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,253
- Oh, upstairs. [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

323
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:47,055
Always knew
you'd land on your feet.

324
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:51,059
Let's go for drinks,
and you're paying, mogul.

325
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:55,763
I hope she likes water.

326
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:58,850
Now what am I going to do?
Stacy's in the building.

327
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:01,652
Well, you could move to Narnia
and run that branch,

328
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:04,689
you pathological liar.

329
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:07,492
Max, this is not
how I want people to see me,

330
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:09,861
or smell me, quite frankly.

331
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:12,229
We have to get rid
of the salami, the chandelier,

332
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:14,532
and the Sophie.
This is our dream, not hers.

333
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:16,417
Okay, fine, I'll tell her.

334
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,837
Hey, Sophie,
can we talk to you?

335
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,539
Good news, girls.

336
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,625
Now we sell scratchers.

337
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:27,578
But I have even a better idea.

338
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,382
You two should dress up
as big cupcakes

339
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:33,885
and pass out free samples.

340
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:39,390
Sophie, Max has something
she wants to say to you.

341
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:40,892
Wait.

342
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:44,112
Girls, I have something
to say first.

343
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:46,430
[Sighs]

344
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:51,435
Two days ago, I was
on the verge of suicide.

345
00:15:51,437 --> 00:15:55,106
Yeah, seriously,
I hadn't eaten all afternoon.

346
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:58,776
But your generosity
with your dream

347
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:03,214
has given me a reason
to get up and get a wax.

348
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:04,966
Yeah.

349
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:09,754
Oh. Max, there was something
you wanted to say?

350
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,925
I was going to say--

351
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:18,315
[laughs]

352
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,815
You look delicious.

353
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:24,468
I look like
Honey Boo Boo's mom at the prom.

354
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,540
This is so humiliating.

355
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:35,992
[Scoffs]
Now I know how Tyra felt

356
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,578
when she went undercover
as that fat person.

357
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,747
Please tell me
this is our bottom.

358
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,216
Well, it's your bottom.
I went to happy hour once

359
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,218
and woke up naked
in the penguin habitat

360
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,453
at the Bronx zoo.

361
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:48,957
And I did things.

362
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,342
Hey, girls.

363
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:56,179
What are you two doing
just standing there?

364
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,565
God gave cupcakes legs
for a reason.

365
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,684
You need to hit the streets,

366
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:06,072
shake your cake maker,
and show people your goods.

367
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,357
Hey, don't look at me,
it's vanilla.

368
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,159
I was looking forward
to going up

369
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:11,611
to complete strangers
on the street

370
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,947
and saying "eat me,"
but she won't leave.

371
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,284
Well, if you're not going to
go out and get the customers,

372
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:20,369
then I'll have to bring
the customers to you.

373
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:23,656
I gotta do everything
around here.

374
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,593
Seriously, I can't believe
we're just standing here

375
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:29,512
when we could be chasing
fat people down the street,

376
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:33,165
yelling, "you ate my brother!"

377
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,717
Look at you two.

378
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,886
What I wouldn't give
for a giant glass of milk.

379
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,271
- [Laughs]
- Look at you, though.

380
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:39,522
You look so cute.

381
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:40,840
No, don't look at me.

382
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,775
I'm totally embarrassed
in this thing.

383
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:45,444
Yes, she's cute
and embarrassed,

384
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:48,982
in a larger-than-life,
colorful, public setting.

385
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:51,467
Ah, right.

386
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,786
So, Caroline, listen,
I wanted to--

387
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:57,273
Look, girls,
some young professionals.

388
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:59,242
Oh, my God!
She's bringing Stacy.

389
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,294
She can't see me in this.
I was her valedictorian.

390
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,846
Take this.

391
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:10,553
Oh! Ugh!
Oh! Wait.

392
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,672
Help me up, Max!
Help me up!

393
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,176
Oh, great.
Now you're like my mom.

394
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:19,145
Here, give me your left hand.

395
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,148
[Groans] Okay,
give me your right hand.

396
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,935
Get up! Get up!
Five second rule.

397
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:31,274
[Grunts]

398
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:36,362
Ugh! [Sighs]

399
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:39,231
What are you two
crazy cakes doing?

400
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,868
You lost your customers.
They ran away.

401
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,669
Oh, thank God.

402
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:45,204
Oh, I don't get it.

403
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:47,924
You won't push the hoagies
or the pickled eggs.

404
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,627
You must really
have a fear of success.

405
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,348
Well, at least
we missed Stacy.

406
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,967
Well, you know
what else you missed? Andy.

407
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,085
He was about to tell you
he loves you.

408
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:01,420
What?

409
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:03,756
Just now, in the hall,
and at the ice rink.

410
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:05,725
He's been trying
to tell you all week.

411
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,810
But I've been
too preoccupied with work,

412
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:11,948
like Sandra Bullock
in <i>The Proposal.</i>

413
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,650
So he was gonna tell me
at the ice rink?

414
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:16,152
The one in Central Park?

415
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:19,789
Yes, while having cocoa
and splitting a hot dog.

416
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,273
Oh, my God!

417
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:23,876
That's, like,
my dream "I love you" scenario.

418
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:26,329
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

419
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,381
Because when it comes
to other people's

420
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,717
creepy love stuff, that's
when I'm a silent partner,

421
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:35,087
and you need to stop
with this creepy rom-com stuff.

422
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,589
Life isn't like a movie.

423
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:39,258
Sometimes you're not
a success right away

424
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,811
sometimes you have to just
eat it and be a cupcake,

425
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,296
and sometimes you have to
take your "I love you"

426
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:46,232
whichever way it comes.

427
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,184
You are so right.

428
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,102
I don't have to wait
for the moment to be perfect,

429
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:51,404
like it was
for Reese Witherspoon

430
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:54,573
in <i>Sweet Home Alabama.</i>

431
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,809
My life's
not a romantic comedy.

432
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:58,411
I can do it my own way.

433
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:01,281
Like Julia Roberts in
<i>My Best Friend's Wedding.</i>

434
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:11,290
Andy, it's me!

435
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,575
I'll be right out.

436
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,110
No, this can't wait
any longer.

437
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,245
I don't need
a big romantic comedy moment.

438
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:17,513
- No--
- [Grunts]

439
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:18,931
Oh!
Oh.

440
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,599
Oh, sorry.
I thought it was the office!

441
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,351
Not the office.

442
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:24,637
[Struggling]
I'm stuck.

443
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,223
Oh, I want to go, but I can't.

444
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,859
And I'll never
be able to go again.

445
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,362
Well, I'm on the toilet
and you're in a cupcake.

446
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:36,699
Can't get creepier than this,
so, Caroline,

447
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,701
I love you.

448
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:42,338
I love you too.

449
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:46,042
Oh, please, push me out.

450
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:52,031
How'd it go?
Was it romantic?

451
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,917
He told me he loved me
on the toilet.

452
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,670
Oh, man!
That's my dream scenario!

453
00:20:58,672 --> 00:20:59,922
Hey.

454
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:02,224
I'm only gonna do this
for an hour,

455
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:04,226
to show you how it's done,

456
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,228
and then I'm out.

457
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,514
This is your dream, not mine.

458
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:11,500
Cupcakes!
Free cupcakes!

459
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:13,869
Come on, get 'em!

460
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:16,057
Get 'em while they're hot!

461
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:20,963
