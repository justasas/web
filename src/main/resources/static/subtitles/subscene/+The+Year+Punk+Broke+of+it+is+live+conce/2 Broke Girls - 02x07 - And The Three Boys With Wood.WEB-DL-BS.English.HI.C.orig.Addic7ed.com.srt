What are you doing
back so early?

Did Chestnut
forget his wallet?

4
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:11,950
No, we saw that cat
we don't like.

00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,918
I tried to spray it
with a water bottle,

so we ran.

this winter,

00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,031
I once got a ten-year-old
I was babysitting

176

to buy me a box of Pop-Tarts
with his allowance.

Not much, but--
