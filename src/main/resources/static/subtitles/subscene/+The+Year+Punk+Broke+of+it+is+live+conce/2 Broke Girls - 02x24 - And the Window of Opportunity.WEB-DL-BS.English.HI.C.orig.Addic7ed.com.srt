1
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:06,675
I can't believe Han is making
us tidy up this damn diner.

2
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:10,311
It's like putting
a pretty church hat on a whore.

3
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:15,950
Come on, harder, faster!
Do it faster and harder.

4
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:21,356
Ding! What is, "Things Han
says to a male hustler," Alex.

5
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:22,623
No time for jokes, Max.

6
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:24,325
The health inspector
will be here soon,

7
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,194
and I need to get
that "A" rating.

8
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:28,629
This diner getting an "A"
for cleanliness

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,266
would be like me getting an "A"
for a bra size.

10
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:35,269
Oh, it will happen.
I did a thorough job.

11
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:45,913
Is he making omelets
or crystal meth?

12
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:50,385
Oleg, you let Han put you
in two hair nets?

13
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:53,789
Three.
I don't want to talk about it.

18
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,293
Sorry I'm late.
I was having my nails done.

19
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:13,295
It's the first time
I stopped moving in two years,

20
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:16,031
and I fell asleep.

21
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,233
You had money to get
your nails done?

22
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:20,335
Question: Was prostitution
as disgusting

23
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:23,205
as you thought it would be?

24
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:24,506
Han paid for it.

25
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,975
Oh, so it was worse.

26
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:29,611
There she is.

27
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,780
There's my show pony.

28
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:34,883
Let me see them digits.

29
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:37,285
I want you to be the first thing
the health inspector sees

30
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:38,286
when he enters.

31
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:41,156
You're just so blonde
and clean.

32
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:46,161
Hey! Where's my manicure?
How come I don't get anything?

33
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,930
Oh, I haven't forgotten you.
Here's 50 bucks.

34
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,199
Beat it until
the inspector leaves.

35
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:57,539
Some would be insulted.
I'm gonna ask for $75.

36
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,808
And, you are going to get it.

37
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,680
I have exciting news.
At the nail salon,

38
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:08,283
I heard about this amazing
seminar we should go to.

39
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:10,619
[Laughs] Oh, no, no, no.

40
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,487
I went to a seminar once.

41
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:15,590
I was almost married
to 300 Koreans.

42
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:18,360
It's a branding seminar
for business owners

43
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,562
to define who they are
and get them primed and ready

44
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:22,564
for their window
of opportunity.

45
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:26,001
I think I'd rather be married
to 300 Koreans.

46
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:28,870
Then I could get my nails done
whenever I wanted.

47
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:30,439
Max, this is the real deal.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,541
The woman who runs it
is a branding genius.

49
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:34,676
She created the Nike
"Just Do It."

50
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,711
Oh, that woman
didn't make up "just do it."

51
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:39,748
high school boyfriends have been
using that for centuries.

52
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,017
You're still here!

53
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,920
What's it gonna take,
another $10?

54
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,155
Hey, I don't need a seminar.

55
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:51,526
I found a brand that's gonna
get me rich--obnoxious!

56
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:54,096
Okay, Earl, how is cleaning
your area coming along?

57
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:56,731
I've got decades
of napkins over here

58
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:58,834
with all my old ideas on them.

59
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:02,104
Apparently,
napkins were the old Twitter.

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,874
Hello.

61
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,808
Could you tell the owner

62
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:08,710
the health inspector
has arrived?

63
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:10,545
Oh, you are a woman.

64
00:03:10,546 --> 00:03:12,747
Thank you for noticing.

65
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,051
Are you Han Lee?

66
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:18,253
Hey, Han, is this the--

67
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:22,791
So where would you like
to start?

68
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,227
Sadly, the men's room.

69
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:27,796
Ground zero.

70
00:03:27,797 --> 00:03:29,764
I will join you
in a second.

71
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:31,800
Is it Miss or Mrs. Rotello?

72
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:35,003
It's Miss.
Thank you for asking.

73
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:39,040
I'll see you at the toilets.

74
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,043
Ground zero just got
a lot nicer.

75
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:50,352
Han, I think that health
inspector wants to inspect you.

76
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:53,088
Stop! If she hears you,
she'll give me an "F."

77
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:55,824
I think she wants you
to give her an "F."

78
00:03:57,226 --> 00:04:00,095
Max, I paid you $90.
Now, go!

79
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:03,298
- Here, Max.
- What's this?

80
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,401
That's how we'll make
the $600 we need for the seminar.

81
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:07,702
I made flyers for
a yard sale at Kinko's.

82
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:11,306
Wow, Kinko's" and "yard sale"
in the same breath.

83
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:14,442
Where do I keep finding
this inner strength?

84
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:18,147
[Knock at door]

85
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:21,217
That must be Sophie
with her yard sale stuff.

86
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:24,303
Hi, girls!

87
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:26,372
Hey, Sophie!
Where's all your junk?

88
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:30,393
Oh, where it always is--
In my trunk! [Laughs]

89
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,796
Well, look here.

90
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:35,598
I got a bunch of stuff
that Oleg wanted

91
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,733
to donate to your yard sale.

92
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,435
Aw, that's so nice of him.

93
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,838
Oh, yeah,
he doesn't know about it.

94
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,939
Yeah, it's all the stuff

95
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,174
he's been leaving around
my apartment.

96
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,643
He's getting way
too comfortable, so...

97
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:51,414
Sell it all!
Yeah. [Laughs]

98
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:54,684
You probably can get a couple
of bucks for his passport.

99
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,086
Yeah, he paid $80 for it.

100
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,754
Maybe he's leaving
things around

101
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:01,090
because he wants to take things
to another level,

102
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,625
maybe even move in.

103
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:06,796
Oh, girl talk.
Ooh!

104
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:10,967
Shouldn't you serve me a cosmo
like they do on television?

105
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:13,469
Don't have any cosmos,
as we're broke

106
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,572
and it's not 1998, but...

107
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:17,907
How about a pink cupcake?

108
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,842
Oh, even better.

109
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:22,145
Maybe now that Oleg
has told you he loves you,

110
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:25,448
you're starting to have intimacy
issues about getting close.

111
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,450
Oh, come on.

112
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:30,720
Save that garbage
for your yard sale.

113
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:33,956
Yeah, the man is just
up there too much.

114
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:38,094
I mean, he's down there when
he's up there, but, yeah...

115
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:40,463
It's way too much, yeah.

116
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,398
He's got to change,
or he's out.

117
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,468
Hey, thanks
for the cupcake, Max.

118
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,436
And, Caroline...

119
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:49,739
I don't know what you add,
but, yeah.

120
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,677
Our yard sale is not quite
all set up yet.

121
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:56,646
You're early.
Our flyer said 1:00 to 5:00.

122
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,315
Oh, I don't do flyers.

123
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,450
Miss Trudy, my card.

124
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:06,088
This is my wife, Miss Trudy,
and the bird's name is Scott.

125
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,757
Dennis Endicott The Third,

126
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:11,160
thrift shop scout and Brooklyn's
crazy kitsch genius.

127
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,530
"Lord of The Things."

128
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,569
So, I have lots
of classic couture pieces.

129
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,937
You won't be disappointed.

130
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:24,607
Well, I have been before.
Miss Trudy?

131
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:27,176
[Scoffs] We went all the way
to Pennsylvania for

132
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,111
a <i>Facts of Life</i> bean bag
toss game.

133
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:31,247
- No Blair!
- [Whispering] No Blair.

134
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:33,449
Just two tooties.

135
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:36,819
Life just sucks
it hard sometimes.

136
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,754
Am I right, Scott?

137
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:40,156
So, on that chair
are my things,

138
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:41,324
and you'll notice
that there's a lot--

139
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:44,026
Oh, I already did.
14 for all of it.

140
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:45,595
$1,400, perfect!

141
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:48,998
Hundred?
Darling, $14.

142
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,734
But this is all vintage.

143
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:54,370
Vintage, or just
out of season?

144
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,373
Wait, is that a Nugget Buddy?

145
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,075
Miss Trudy,
they have the cowboy.

146
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:00,409
He loves the cowboy.

147
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,546
I bet he does.

148
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:05,214
Oh, I am so relieved.

149
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,984
When we don't find anything
good, he gets really mad...

150
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:10,019
[Whispers] At me.

151
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,921
I'm sorry, that's not supposed
to be out.

152
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:13,222
I can't break up the set.

153
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:15,324
You have all ten
Nugget Buddies?

154
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:18,661
Yep, and every other
Happy Meal toy since 1993.

155
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:20,296
My mom used to take me there
a lot.

156
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:24,100
[Laughs] Well, she used to leave
me there a lot, but same diff.

157
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,835
$600 for the whole collection.

158
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,870
- Sold!
- Whoa, whoa, not sold.

159
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:29,705
Max, come on,
this is our future.

160
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:31,907
Well, those are my past.
No sale.

161
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,142
Let's go, Scott.

162
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:36,012
This is "tootie-gate"
all over again.

163
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:37,346
And you--

164
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:40,516
when we get home, you better put
on the punishment pillow.

165
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,555
Don't worry.
I kind of like it.

166
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,526
Well, so much for a horse
in a hat

167
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,928
being the weirdest thing
in this yard.

168
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:03,060
Explain to me again how
an item I paid $3,000 for

169
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:05,579
just two years ago
is worth less than something

170
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,848
that came
with a dipping sauce!

171
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:12,653
A Happy Meal toy reminds
people of a sweeter time,

172
00:08:12,654 --> 00:08:15,923
a simpler time,
a pre-Kardashian time.

173
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:18,392
Attention, attention!

174
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,327
I have something
very important here.

175
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:23,063
The results of your DNA test
proving your mother was Asian

176
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:25,265
and your father
was a pine nut?

177
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:28,469
No, we got our letter grade

178
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,205
from the city
health inspector's office.

179
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,443
[Gasps] Whoo!
We got a "B"!

180
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:37,978
That's the first "B"
I ever got

181
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,048
I didn't have
to French kiss for.

182
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,816
A "B"?
No, no, no, no!

183
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,618
This boy don't play
with no Bs.

184
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:47,821
I'm calling that little tease,
Miss Jean Rotello, right now.

185
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:52,192
This isn't good.
Asians don't do well with Bs.

186
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:54,561
At Wharton, I got a "B,"
and the Japanese kid

187
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:57,297
who sat next to me
killed himself.

188
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:04,238
Oleg, I'm kind of getting used
to this look now.

189
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:07,274
You kind of look like
Bin Laden's ghost.

190
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,246
Good night, girls.

191
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:14,715
I'm going to go over and spend
the night at Sophie's.

192
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:16,050
No, maybe not.

193
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:17,117
Why would you say that?

194
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:20,421
Because she can't
stop herself.

195
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:22,956
It's just, she might like
a little space sometimes.

196
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:24,792
She needs space?
Did she say that?

197
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:29,163
- Not in so many words.
- No, those were the words.

198
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:31,331
Look, Sophie
loves having you around.

199
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:32,599
It's just, she told us that
you're getting

200
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,268
a little too comfortable there
when she came over

201
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:36,170
to sell all your stuff
at our yard sale.

202
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:40,340
- I know how that sounds--
- And yet, you keep going.

203
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,945
Oleg, Sophie is just feeling
a little smothered.

204
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:46,346
She feels smothered?

205
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:49,583
Have you ever tried
motorboating those cans of hers?

206
00:09:52,954 --> 00:09:56,390
Once, but I was very drunk
at the time.

207
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:02,496
Just make a few changes,

208
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:04,064
and everything will
be right back on track.

209
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:05,833
And stop talking now.

210
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:08,669
Make some changes?
That's all I've done for her.

211
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,371
I changed my furniture,
I changed my ways.

212
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:14,441
I changed my underwear
more than once a week.

213
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:21,215
That's it.
No more changing for Han...

214
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:23,684
And no more changing
for Sophie.

215
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:31,892
I'm done changing.
I'm back, baby.

216
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:34,061
Spread the word!

217
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:46,373
I think he's gonna be
spreading more than the word.

218
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:48,175
I want to kill someone!

219
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:51,478
Why, did they cancel
<i>Suite Life of Zack and Cody?</i>

220
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:57,484
No, I just got off the phone
with the restaurant inspector--

221
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,553
She answered her phone
at this time of night?

222
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:02,756
Come on, it's not like
she was out on the town.

223
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:04,124
Han!

224
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,361
I think that "B" you're holding
might stand for "Bitch."

225
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:09,796
And she told me I got a "B"
because of the conditions

226
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,166
of the back room
off the dishwasher area.

227
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:15,035
I didn't even know we had
a back room, did you?

228
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,404
No, but of course there's
a mysterious back room

229
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:18,805
in this new upside down world,

230
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:22,376
where a piece of cheese is mayor
and Donna Karan is a no one!

231
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:28,815
Oh, there it is.

232
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,250
I always thought
that was the property

233
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:31,752
of the bar next door.

234
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:33,754
If we share a door with a bar,

235
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:38,258
my breaks are about
to get longer and drunker.

236
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,994
Wait here, girls,
while I push this rack away.

237
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,432
[Grunting]

238
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:49,136
[Grunting]

239
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:52,339
P90X, don't fail me now!

240
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:05,118
I'm pretty sure this is what
my soul looks like.

241
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,990
Now I'm going to have to hire
an emergency crew to come

242
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:12,359
clean this by Friday
to get my "A."

243
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,694
Oh, damn it.

244
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,462
I guess Caroline
and I can do it.

245
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:18,165
Are you insane?
Max, I can't.

246
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,134
I haven't worked on
the railroads like you.

247
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:22,502
Come on.

248
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:25,072
Han needs his "A," and we need
the money for that seminar.

249
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:27,474
Isn't this one of those
"windows of opportunity"?

250
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,777
- $600.
- Forget it, girls.

251
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:31,845
Look at these walls.

252
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,981
I need professional
steam cleaners.

253
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:35,382
I have steam cleaned before.

254
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:37,384
I mean, how else do you get
malt liquor and blood stains

255
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:39,519
out of a rented prom dress?

256
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,992
Ugh, it's so humid
and damp in here.

257
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:47,194
Now I know how balls feel.

258
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,403
Let me just move
this cord out of--

259
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:58,338
[electricity sparking]
Oh! I just got a shock!

260
00:12:58,339 --> 00:12:59,406
[Laughs] No.

261
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,341
A shock is coming home
to find your mom

262
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:03,610
in the tub with
your tenth-grade crush.

263
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:08,081
I should push these
light cords back up over--

264
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:12,486
[screaming]

265
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,788
Uh, it's a roach nest.

266
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:18,825
[Screaming]

267
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:20,460
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay, it's okay!

268
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,029
It's okay!
[Whimpering]

269
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,032
Good news,
they're already dead.

270
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:27,000
Bad news, as I pull them

271
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,770
out of your hair,
they're decomposing.

272
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:32,072
- [Whimpering]
- Are you crying?

273
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:33,240
I can't do this.

274
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:35,309
Not even for the seminar.

275
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,678
I'll sell my Happy Meals.

276
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,179
Max, you don't have
to do that.

277
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,415
- But we need the money.
- Okay, great.

278
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:48,694
Hey, Nugget Buddies.

279
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,729
As soon as the man
with the bird gets here,

280
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,164
you'll be leaving
my loving care

281
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,333
and going out
into the big, bad world.

282
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,101
Shoes will step on you,

283
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,602
kids will tie you
to firecrackers,

284
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,072
and some real sickos may stick you
in a trunk and drive you across state lines.

285
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,374
[Knock at door]

286
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,742
Hi, Sophie.

287
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:10,180
Oleg cheated on me,
and I'm so [Screaming] maaad!

288
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:13,250
[Screaming]

289
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,669
Oh, I have to break things!

290
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,005
But everything upstairs
in my apartment is too nice!

291
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:21,775
So... Run a tab, girls!

292
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:24,878
[Screams]

293
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,548
Aah!
[Screams]

294
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:33,520
[Screaming]

295
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:38,125
I gotta break more things!
[Screams]

296
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:40,060
Wait, don't break that box!
That's my Happy--

297
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:43,764
[screaming]

298
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:45,232
Ohh.

299
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,367
I feel better.

300
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:49,236
I really do.

301
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:53,073
Okay.
All right.

302
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,941
I think we just saw what
it would look like

303
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:57,544
if someone cheated
on The Incredible Hulk.

304
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,149
Hey, girls.
[Breathing heavily]

305
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,285
Sophie's back.
Spread the word!

306
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:12,826
Max, look,
your Happy Meal toys.

307
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,401
Look, I know you're upset
about your toys, Max,

308
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:24,271
but come on,
it's kind of fun.

309
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:26,339
There is only one kind of wet
that I have been at 3:00

310
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,842
in the morning
that I would call "fun."

311
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:31,011
This is not it!

312
00:15:33,147 --> 00:15:35,515
Oh, look!
Under the newspaper,

313
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:37,784
there's some sort of
stained glass window there.

314
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:39,920
Aw, pretty!

315
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,456
Oh, you're finally getting
the money you wanted

316
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,524
and you're so chipper.

317
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:47,060
I'm "chipper,"
to use your word, because

318
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:49,863
we're working to earn money to
move our business brand forward.

319
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:51,398
Stop saying "brand."

320
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,801
And this "seminar"
better be worth it.

321
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,369
Why are you saying
it like that?

322
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,104
"Seminar," with quotes
around it,

323
00:15:58,105 --> 00:15:59,906
like it's a silly idea
or something.

324
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,675
I didn't say "seminar"
with quotes around it.

325
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:03,443
You did.
You said--

326
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:04,644
Ooh! Ooh, sorry!

327
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:06,513
Sorry!

328
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,982
I was trying to illustrate that
you put quotes around it.

329
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,885
I am too tired to put quotes
around things,

330
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,720
but if I were gonna put quotes
on a word,

331
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:16,556
that word would be,
"seminar"!

332
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:18,225
Oh, and "branding"!

333
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,428
And I would put big, giant,
dumbass quotes around

334
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:23,763
"branding seminar"!

335
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,966
Max, you did that
on purpose!

336
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,668
Oh, maybe it was just
an accident!

337
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:34,007
Stop! Stop!
You're spraying the light cord!

338
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:36,476
Hello!
Water and electricity,

339
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:39,045
not the best combo!

340
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:42,716
Like some other not-great combos
I can think of.

341
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:45,318
Us?
You mean us?

342
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:47,587
What, now we are not
