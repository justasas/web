1
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,537
<i>It was our secret place</i>
<i>when we were five and six.

2
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,657
<i>Willy Hill, she used to call it.

3
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,576
<i>You could crouch down, shelter</i>
<i>under the overhanging rock if it rained.

4
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,700
<i>We kept a blanket there

5
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,020
<i>and sometimes had feasts</i>
<i>of chocolates and lollies.

6
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,340
<i>But she'd still go there,</i>
<i>even when she was 16.

7
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,171
<i>It was still her special place.

8
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,580
<i>When night was falling,

9
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,580
<i>it was like... you were on a ship

10
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,700
<i>and the hill sailed on through the night,

11
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,260
<i>with the land and the sky lapping past.

12
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,780
<i>Every tree and rock,

13
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,819
<i>to her, was almost like</i>
<i>they were living things.

14
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,900
<i>We'd always been close.

15
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,980
<i>Always been really sweet and gentle</i>
<i>with each other.

16
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,420
What are you doing shooting again?
I thought I told you no shooting!

17
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,420
If that gun had been loaded,
it could've gone off.

18
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,900
We'd have both been killed!

19
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,740
You shouldn't have had it
in the first place!

20
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,860
Stop pressing against me!
I'm not!

21
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,780
I know what you're doing.
I can feel you!

22
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,780
Arrgh!

23
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,500
Agh, that's not fair!
Right, no more shooting.

24
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,060
I wasn't gonna shoot anything anyway.

25
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,460
I was just getting some rabbits
for the old man's dog!

26
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,939
Promise!
Ow! Alright! Promise!

27
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,220
That hurt.
Serves you right.

28
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,780
What were you doing,
jumping on me like that?

29
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,540
'Cause I felt like it.

30
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,540
God, you're juvenile.

31
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh, sorry,
you're so mature for your age.

32
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,133
I bags red!

33
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,373
It's slippery!

34
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,493
1-0.

35
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,660
Your gran been fed yet?

36
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,140
It's Gail's turn.

37
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,971
I took it in half an hour ago.

38
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,780
Haven't you got any homework?

39
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,980
Yes, Nils.

40
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,413
Don't be cheeky.

41
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,980
I'm just going down the road.

42
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,413
Gee, that's unusual.

43
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,812
If I see you playing that thing once more,
I'll throw it out!

44
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,900
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

45
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,180
I won then. 3-2.

46
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,700
3-3.

47
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,340
Fair go!

48
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,810
Alright, 3-2. You can win.
You always have to win, don't you?

49
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,620
What's wrong with Nils?
 I don't know.

50
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,134
It's 'cause hardly anyone's
come in all day.

51
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,140
I don't blame them either.

52
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,700
Who'd wanna come to
a dump like this?

53
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,660
It's the highway, isn't it, Mrs Olson?

54
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,740
Everyone takes the shortcut.

55
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,180
They weren't thinking about us
when they built it, that's for sure.

56
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,060
We're gonna go broke, aren't we?

57
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,620
- We'll all starve like the Africans.
- You shouldn't say that!

58
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,220
Has Gran had dinner?
I told you!

59
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,020
I took it in half an hour ago.

60
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,820
Did you help her eat it?
No, I had to do the washing up!

61
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,460
You've gotta help her with it now.
She'll get it all over herself!

62
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,700
I put a towel around her neck!
You two, shut up!

63
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,055
One of you see if your gran's alright.

64
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,420
OK. See you later.

65
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,978
11:30?
Yeah.

66
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,060
Come on, you haven't had
much of your dinner yet.

67
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,249
You like egg custard, don't you?
It's your favourite.

68
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,573
Did I tell you what we were doing
at school today?

69
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,740
We were learning about Europe,
so I spoke about Norway.

70
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,696
You remember when you told me
about Norway?

71
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,940
Hey, Martin!

72
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Any chance of getting
'The Forbidden Planet' again?

73
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,860
You've seen it three times.

74
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,500
Yeah, it's got a lot to it.

75
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,780
Last time you were
the only one in the audience!

76
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,660
I don't run this place
just for your benefit, you know.

77
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,380
Any other space stuff coming up?

78
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,813
Not on the list.

79
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,700
Any, uh... Brigitte Bardot?

80
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,656
Not that you'd be allowed into.

81
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,380
This your gun, is it, Bandy?

82
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,940
What's he been shooting?

83
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,420
Is it loaded?

84
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,020
Give us it, Pierdon.
Make me.

85
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,220
I'll shoot you.

86
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,500
Yeah, bandicoots are vermin,
aren't they?

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,140
Pierdon...

88
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,020
He'll start bawling in a minute.

89
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,340
Aw. You gonna bawl are you, Bandy?

90
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,820
Aw, Bandy.

91
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,300
Come on.

92
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,700
Wanna be careful, but,
wandering around at night, Danny.

93
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,658
Someone could mistake you
for a bandicoot.

94
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,020
Please, God,

95
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,012
let something terrible happen
to Pierdon and Malseed.

96
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,340
I don't know what.

97
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,460
Maybe a disease, like leprosy.

98
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,620
Maybe they could be taken away

99
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,460
by flying saucers

100
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,973
for experimentation.

101
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,610
<i>The Lord Palmerston</i>
<i>was the best hotel in town.

102
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,820
<i>Sell, it was the only hotel in town.

103
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,180
<i>My parents ran it and we lived upstairs.

104
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,140
<i>The cockatoo lived out the back</i>
<i>near the gents toilets,

105
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,540
<i>which gave him a pretty...</i>
<i>interesting repertoire.

106
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,100
You hung-over too, are you?

107
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,533
Blurgggh!

108
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,100
Hello, Danny.
G'day, Keith.

109
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,613
Hello, Danny.

110
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,100
No, what we need's
another Rising Fast.

111
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,900
No - Major Tulloch.
- Mr Consistency.

112
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,740
Hey, er, my brother-in-law's got
a promising horse at the moment.

113
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Made it's first start
a couple of months ago

114
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,700
and then it got sink-shore...
er... er, shin-sore.

115
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,940
But it was showing us
a lot at the track.

116
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,020
He gives you the inside information,
does he, Nils?

117
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,340
Oh, yeah.

118
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,740
L-let us know when it's gonna win -
that's for sure.

119
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,900
He's had a couple of other horses,
hasn't he,

120
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,420
this brother-in-law of yours.

121
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's a, you know...
he's got a real eye for the...

122
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,780
They broke down too, didn't they?

123
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,460
Yeah, wasn't there one
running at Randwick?

124
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,180
We all backed it
and it got scratched?

125
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,660
Er, yeah. Er...

126
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,580
A bit of a problem with the float.

127
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,300
Jesus, mate, he can pick 'em,
your brother-in-law.

128
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,540
If they don't get shin-sore,
they'll brain themselves in the horse float.

129
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,980
<i>I first heard about mental telepathy

130
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,420
<i>from this bloke Jonah</i>
<i>who worked on the railways.

131
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,060
<i>And the best thing about it</i>
<i>was Freya being interested too,

132
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,140
<i>'cause whatever she was interested in,</i>
<i>I was.

133
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,020
Look at that!
What?

134
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,300
Well, I've drawn a star,
and the sun's pretty close to a star.

135
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,140
Actually, it <i>is</i> a star.

136
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,180
I s'pose.

137
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,220
I can't tell what I'm picking up
telepathically

138
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,300
and what's just my own mind.

139
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,340
Or your mind.

140
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,900
What else were you getting?

141
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,500
I don't know. Stuff.

142
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,980
What?

143
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,460
Nothing clear.

144
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,620
Why? Thinking dirty thoughts, were you?

145
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,259
I was concentrating on the diagram.
Sure.

146
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,460
<i>Funny thing about Jonah...

147
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,453
<i>... he won the pub raffle every year.

148
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,820
<i>So he had this endless supply of whisky,</i>
<i>which Freya loved,

149
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,580
<i>and I was trying to like it</i>
<i>at least a little bit myself.

150
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,140
Finished.

151
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,620
Completely?

152
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,780
Chapter 12.

153
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,213
Time to celebrate.

154
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,780
You've been on chapter 12
since last year.

155
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,700
A lot of distractions.

156
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,739
Trains, mainly.

157
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,780
Never get a job with clocks.

158
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,213
You can hear your life ticking away.

159
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,413
You ever been in there?

160
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,220
The ghost house? No way.

161
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,100
Are you chicken?
Would you go in there at night?

162
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,533
How much for?

163
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,180
10 quid.

164
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,060
Pathetic. You wouldn't
pay up anyway.

165
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,140
I take Gidget for a walk
down there sometimes.

166
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,096
She won't go near the place.

167
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,260
Dogs can tell when people die,
can't they?

168
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,740
Yeah,

169
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,173
so they reckon.

170
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,940
Corinna, Corinna

171
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,660
Da, da, da, da

172
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,700
Corinna, Corinna

173
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,420
Da-da, da-da, da-da, da

174
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,620
Corinna, Corinna

175
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,099
Da-da, da-da, da...

176
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,780
I've, er, got a book
on hypnotism now.

177
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,460
Oh, yeah?

178
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,020
Need someone to try it out on.

179
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,500
You want me to be your victim?

180
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,728
Yeah.

181
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,013
See you later.

182
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,860
Where have you been?

183
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,293
Out.

184
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,060
Please, God.

185
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,620
I'm sorry for this.

186
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,060
I promise I'll give it up by my next birthday

187
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,060
if you help her not to telepathically
pick up that I'm out here.

188
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,020
Please, God,

189
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,773
help her not to draw the curtains.

190
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,770
I meant the blinds as well.

191
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,451
<i>I was so stuck on Frey.

192
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,093
<i>I couldn't think of anything else.

193
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,380
<i>I used to try sending her</i>
<i>thought messages

194
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,611
<i>about what a fascinating</i>
<i>and desirable person I was.

195
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,620
<i>I'd send them so hard</i>
<i>that I'd have to stop

196
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,169
<i>in case I short-circuited my brain</i>
<i>and became a moron.

197
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,660
<i>Every year we used to earn pocket money

198
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,860
<i>helping with the hay baling</i>
<i>at some of the nearby properties.

199
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,140
<i>That's when Freya got to know</i>
<i>Trevor Leishman for the first time.

200
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,500
<i>He was a full-back</i>
<i>in the school football team.

201
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,660
<i>Pretty big deal.

202
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,810
<i>Everyone around town knew him</i>
<i>because he was wild.

203
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,340
How are you going, Frey?

204
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,980
Alright.

205
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,020
<i>Always getting into trouble at school</i>
<i>or with the police.

206
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,013
People said he was hyperactive -
whatever that meant.

207
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,213
Thanks, Tommo.

208
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,458
She's a bit bloody warm, mate.

209
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,380
Hey, does your father
allow you to drink?

210
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,740
He's my stepfather.

211
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,220
Freya!

212
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,500
Fair go, Tommo.
Couple of mouthfuls won't hurt her.

213
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,620
Yeah? Well, we all know where you
get your drinking experience from.

214
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,940
Yeah.

215
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,420
Hey, hey! Easy!

216
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,853
Hey!

217
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,693
Stop showing off.

218
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,420
I can always get my first name.

219
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,140
The way you know when
you're really drunk

220
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,420
is when you can get
your second one as well.

221
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,300
That's what my old man taught me.

222
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,740
Longest I ever got was my whole name
plus three letters.

223
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,940
But I was busting.

224
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,612
I'd been saving it up all day.

225
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,533
Shh!

226
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,300
She's changed
in the past couple of years.

227
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,180
Yeah.

228
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,300
Not a bad sort now.

229
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,255
Yeah.

230
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,740
You know her pretty well, don't you?

231
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,173
Since we were kids.

232
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,650
Is she your girlfriend?

233
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,089
Oh... sort of. Not really.

234
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,300
Piss off!

235
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,860
<i>A couple of miles out of town</i>
<i>was the swimming hole

236
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,740
<i>where a lot of the mating rituals</i>
<i>took place.

237
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,334
<i>That's what people who study tribes</i>
<i>would call them, I think.

238
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,300
<i>Pretty juvenile sort of stuff.

239
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,220
He's a pisspot
through and through

240
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,020
He's a drunkard, so they say

241
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,460
He tried to get to heaven
but he went the other way

242
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,660
Drink it down, down, down, down
down, down, down, down, down.

243
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,740
Come on! Go, Chris!

244
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,260
Come on! Yep, you're going in!

245
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,740
I've got her!

246
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,173
Time to go in!

247
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,220
Let's get Olson!

248
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,580
Run!

249
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,620
Get her!
Come on, tackle her!

250
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,020
Get her!

251
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,980
Quick! Go!
Get her!

252
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,460
Whoops!

253
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,260
- You'll get it in a minute!
- - Get her top off!

254
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,780
Get off, you bastard.

255
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,820
Get out of the way!
Under the water!

256
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,100
Go in the water!

257
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,580
Get her in the water!

258
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,180
Come on! Bring her in.

259
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,660
Whoo!

260
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,140
You're twisting my arm!

261
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,620
Get her in!

262
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
OK! One...

263
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,420
One! Two!

264
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,900
Three!

265
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,298
Yay!

266
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,660
Bastard.

267
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,900
Hold her under!

268
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,333
Whoo-hoo!

269
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,337
Dunk her! Dunk her!

270
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,580
Bastard.

271
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,337
Hey, don't drown her, Trev!

272
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,860
He's off his head.

273
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,820
Leishman!
Trev!

274
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,580
Let her up, you mad...

275
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,900
She's alright, aren't you, Frey?

276
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,856
Yeah..
Yeah, I'm alright.

277
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,900
They're juvenile, aren't they?

278
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,940
Who?

279
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,460
Oh, Leishman and those kids.

280
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,980
I don't think so.

281
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,380
Look at your knees.
They're all scraped.

282
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,860
So?

283
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,860
It's so sexy.

284
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,660
God, you're a pain.

285
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,700
Hi, Mary.

286
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,220
Oh, hello, Freya.
How nice to see you.

287
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,820
That's Danny, isn't it?
Hello, Danny.

288
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,540
Hi, Mrs O'Neil.

289
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,580
How are you going
for milk and eggs and everything?

290
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,140
Well, I'm getting a bit low.

291
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,380
I put the money in the jar
so I wouldn't forget.

292
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,860
There's the money.

293
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,180
Now, would you like a cup of tea?

294
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,414
That's my young man.

295
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,140
He was great-Iooking,
- wasn't he?

296
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,740
I liked him better out of uniform than in.

297
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,820
"The wind on the hill is in your hair

298
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,020
"The smell of the rain perfumes the air..."

299
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,740
Oh, here he is.

300
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,860
The poet.
What?

301
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,977
Malseed's found all that stuff
you've been writing in your desk.

302
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,420
"We once were friends and still are now

303
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,980
"But you think I'm too young to love
But I know..."

304
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,980
Give us it back, Malseed,
or I'll belt you.

305
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,820
You're so sensitive, Danny.

306
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,380
"If only I could prove it to you
You would see

307
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,300
"We could become two
and be forever free."

308
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,020
OK, into the dunny!

309
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,220
No!
Into the girls dunny!

310
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,780
Poofter, Embling!

311
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,260
Gail!

312
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,980
From now on, you're gonna
use these toilets.

313
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,413
You're dead! I swear.

314
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,340
Are you a girl, Bandy?

315
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,820
Fuck off!

316
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,300
Wash your hair in it, Bandy.

317
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,180
You want a bit of soap down there,
Embling?

318
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,420
One, two...
Three.

319
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,860
No!
Down!

320
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,740
Come on, back down there!

321
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,378
How's it feeling, Embling?

322
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,060
Bloody good odds, isn't it?

323
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,780
Nah, he's thirsty, Trev. Come on.
Arggh!

324
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,213
Put him down.

325
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,220
It was just a joke, Trev.

326
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,176
Yeah, he's alright. He was laughing.

327
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,660
Arggh!

328
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,220
Come on, Trev, it was a joke.

329
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,778
Get out of the way.

330
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,660
Stop, Trev!

331
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,180
You're out of your mind! Arrgh!

332
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,660
I was only joking!

333
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,300
Should've seen what he done to us!

334
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,820
We were only mucking around anyway.

335
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,580
Heads or tails, fellas?
Alright. Heads it is.

336
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,380
Oh, no.

337
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,893
Arrgh!

338
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,298
Sounded hollow, I reckon.

339
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,259
Danny?

340
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,973
You alright?

341
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,900
Have you done
your composition yet?

342
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,379
No, I'm doing it tonight.

343
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,780
You can't go in.

344
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,260
Why the hell not?

345
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,740
You just can't.
Olson...

346
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
Ow!

347
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,780
What are you doing, you mad bitch?
You're crazy, Olson.

348
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,340
Stupid bloody slut!

349
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,540
Oh, you're disgusting.

350
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,500
Ugh, that's what she learns from
her alkie stepfather, probably.

351
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,420
As you all know,
the first match of the season

352
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,420
is against last year's premiers,
Jagarilda,

353
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,260
And we gave them a run
for their money

354
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,020
both times we played them
last season.

355
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,980
But this time we're gonna go
one better and beat them.

356
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,733
But we're not gonna win
with individual brilliance.

357
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,300
We can only win if we play
together as a team.

358
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,900
And that's why we're here tonight.

359
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,380
To enjoy ourselves,
have a good time? No way.

360
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,660
Because each one of you
has got to be confident

361
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,940
you can rely on each and every
other player in the team.

362
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,860
OK. Now you can start
stuffing yourselves.

363
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,540
G'day.
Hi.

364
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,700
Want a smoke?

365
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,133
Yeah.

366
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,500
Hey, what are you doing later on?
Going home, I suppose.

367
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,860
You wanna... you wanna
come for a drive?

368
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,140
You're not pinching
Mrs Osmond's car again?

369
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,780
Yeah. (Chuckles) The old dear
went away for the weekend.

370
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,860
Went up on the train somewhere.

371
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,657
We'll go to the racecourse.

372
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,939
What'll we do there?

373
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,060
Beat the record.
I done 96 around there last time.

374
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,020
Yeah, and Sergeant Pierce
caught you.

375
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,100
Yeah, well... oh, it was
on the way back.

376
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,136
I mean, it was just,
you know... bad luck.

377
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,453
What else will we do?

378
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,289
That's for you to find out, isn't it,
if you're, er... if you're game.

379
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,700
<i>It was hard to feel really down</i>
<i>on Trevor Leishman,

380
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,569
<i>seeing how he'd saved me</i>
<i>in the girls toilets just that day.

381
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,697
Please, God, don't let him kiss her,
for God's sake.

382
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,220
If she's going to be interested in me,

383
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,053
I have to be more outgoing...

384
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,418
...more of a personality.

385
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,414
Maybe I could be funny, entertaining.

386
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,500
I need to learn jokes.

387
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,100
Talking to yourself?

388
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,700
I was, er... going through
some answers for a history test.

389
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,375
People who talk to themselves grow
hairs on the palms of their hands.

390
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,135
How's Trevor?
Alright.

391
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,620
Do you love him?

392
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,611
You do, don't you?
Why?

393
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,220
'Cause you're always
hanging round with him.

394
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,460
So?

395
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,140
We're going to the movies
on Saturday.

396
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,620
Why don't you ask my sister?
Then you could come as well.

397
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,100
She's in third form.

398
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,489
Same difference between you and her
as between me and Trev.

399
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,100
How's the music?

400
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,260
Can play 'Get a Little
Dirt on Your Hands' now.

401
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,660
Sing it for me.
No.

402
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,260
If you can't sing in front of me,

403
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,251
you'd be hopeless in front
of your millions of fans.

404
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,893
Don't talk as much as we used to
now, do we?

405
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,100
That's 'cause we move
in different circles.

406
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,380
When I was a little boy

407
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,700
My daddy used to say to me, "Son,"

408
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,380
Dah, dah

409
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,420
"We've got a lot of big plans

410
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,980
"And a lot of hard work
to be done."

411
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,620
Neh, neh, neh

412
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,700
"So go get your marbles
and put 'em in..."

413
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,180
You're laughing.

414
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,977
It's good.

415
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,852
Can't sing without a guitar.

416
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,540
Why do you like it up here
so much, anyway?

417
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,300
Do you follow me sometimes?

418
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,733
No.

419
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,780
Y-You've always liked it up here,

420
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,213
even when we were kids.

421
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,460
It's Willy Hill.

422
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,700
My special place.

423
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,980
<i>Dogs can tell when people pass away.

424
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,340
<i>Maybe they pick up</i>
<i>the soul leaving the body

425
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,700
<i>and flying off into space</i>
<i>or wherever they go.

426
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,140
<i>This time, it was old Mrs O'Neil.

427
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,420
<i>It was really nice.</i>
<i>Dropped off in her sleep.

428
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,260
There's a little parcel
for you, Freya.

429
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,860
It has your name on it.

430
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,140
She must have been going to give it
to you on your birthday or whatever.

431
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,180
How old are you now?

432
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,860
Um...

433
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,818
You must be 16, mustn't you?
Yep.

434
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,735
Here we are.

435
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,940
Oh, isn't it lovely?

436
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,020
She bought that at a church fete.

437
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,700
You could put a little picture
of your boyfriend in that.

438
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,740
Do you have a boyfriend?

439
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,500
Danny.

440
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,491
Oh.

441
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,780
Come on! Now! Now!

442
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,740
Get him!
Don't let him through!

443
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,780
Good tackle, Tanner. Good one, son.

444
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,580
Hit the bastards hard!

445
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,060
- Four tries in...
- - Most of that half, I was happy.

446
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,260
But that last try,
they should never have got.

447
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,820
That attempt to tackle was pathetic,
Johnno. Weak as piss.

448
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,620
He just brushed you aside
like you were a girl.

449
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,460
Now, some of the ladies here
could have made a better fist of it.

450
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,340
You don't just wave your arms around
like a bloody windmill.

451
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,100
You go in and you hang on to him,

452
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,580
and you don't let go,
and you pull him to the ground.

453
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,060
You know what?

454
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,460
It looked like you'd already decided
he was too strong for you

455
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,260
and you just went in and fell over
just to make it look good.

456
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,220
And that's another thing.

457
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,700
When he got through Fulson,

458
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,620
the rest of you just stood around
like stunned mullets.

459
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,340
You don't just hand the opposition
a try on a golden platter.

460
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,900
You go in and you chase,

461
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,020
even if you've got no chance
of catching them, keep 'em on it.

462
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,820
But overall, I was not disappointed.

463
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,500
Now, Trevor Leishman, he put in.

464
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,020
He showed a lot of the old G and D.

465
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,860
And that's what I want to see more of.

466
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,940
Cobber, you've been
daydreaming again...

467
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,100
Wanna come to the film tonight?
What?

468
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,220
Do you want to come
to the film tonight?

469
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,140
What's on?

470
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,460
Oh, I think it's called 'Summer Fire'.

471
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Hey, Sal. What's on at
the Flea Palace tonight?

472
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,860
Romance, set in Hawaii.

473
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,620
Why? Who are you going with?
Him.

474
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,100
You just want to take her

475
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,820
'cause you reckon it's got
lots of intimate love scenes, do you?

476
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,460
There's a group of us going, that's all.

477
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,940
I might come too, then.

478
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,020
<i>Stupid, stuck-up little third formers.

479
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,540
- Hey, what time will you pick me up?
- You gotta pick me up too.

480
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,380
Oh, I'll meet you there.

481
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,940
<i>The only reason I wanted to go

482
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,980
<i>was so I could check up on</i>
<i>what happened between Freya and Trev.

483
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,740
<i>Surf's up.

484
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,060
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Those waves sure sound big.

485
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,140
<i>Must have been that storm.

486
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,340
<i>Maybe they'll call it off</i>
<i>if it's too dangerous.

487
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,980
Sit down!

488
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,972
<i>Big waves make for a better showdown.

489
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,420
<i>Are you scared, Johnny?

490
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,853
<i>I don't know.

491
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,134
<i>- I guess...</i>
- - You can tell me.

492
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,140
<i>Sell, ever since</i>
<i>my brother disappeared

493
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,900
<i>after that wipe-out in Saimea Bay...

494
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,180
<i>Yeah.

495
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,500
<i>... well, I wonder if</i>
<i>that could happen to me.

496
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,900
<i>Johnny, I don't want you</i>
<i>to go out there tomorrow.

497
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,780
<i>I don't want you to be world champion.

498
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,540
<i>I just want us to be together.

499
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,978
<i>I want that too,</i>
<i>more than anything else in the world.

500
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,500
<i>But I also have something to prove,

501
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,220
<i>to prove to myself.

502
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,893
<i>I owe it to Jesse to be there tomorrow.

503
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,580
<i>I'm proud of you, Johnny.

504
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,740
<i>Just so long as</i>
<i>you'll be there watching me.

505
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,100
<i>That makes it a whole lot better.

506
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,180
<i>I will be, Johnny.</i>
<i>Yeah?

507
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,613
<i>I will be.

508
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,540
Gail.

509
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,580
It wasn't me. It was Bandicoot.

510
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,060
Bloody Bandy.

511
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,940
Well, thanks.

512
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,700
Did you like it, the film?

513
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,133
It was dumb.

514
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,260
Well, I might as well go, I suppose.

515
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,060
See ya.

516
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,780
Hey.

517
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,700
Hey! What are you doing, you little...

518
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,780
Carrying on in front of
the whole bloody town!

519
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,860
God. 'Bye, Trev.

520
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,060
Nah, don't worry about it.

521
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,020
I don't want you to see her again.

522
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,580
And you... And you just stay away
from this bodgie, alright?

523
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,180
Shut up, for God's sake.

524
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,260
Well, someone's got to
lay down the bloody law.

525
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,780
If you're too blind to see
what's really going on out here.

526
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,660
Will you come inside? You're drunk.

527
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,140
Couldn't you see what was going on?

528
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,580
Yeah, real nice talking
to you too, Mr Olson.

529
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,492
Don't want to keep me voice down.
You've woken the whole town.

530
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,978
You ever been in love?

531
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,820
When I lived in Cootamundra.

532
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,540
She worked in
the 'Spirit of Progress' catering car.

533
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,460
Trains would change crews in Coota.

534
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,660
Girls would stay there overnight.

535
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,020
Lord Byron Hotel.

536
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,380
Past your bedtime.

537
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,020
He can't sleep. He's in love.
Yeah?

538
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,260
Well, you're his mate,
so you can't be the lucky lady.

539
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
It's Gail.

540
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,500
Should've seen them carrying on
after the flicks the other night.

541
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,933
YOU can talk.

542
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,380
I might sleep at the ghost house tonight.
Win your ten quid.

543
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,420
If you're staying there,
I'm staying there with you.

544
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,978
Oh, isn't he a gentleman?

545
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,860
Who used to live in it?

546
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,620
People called the Amerys, apparently.

547
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,420
Is that who haunts it? One of them?

548
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,020
I don't believe in ghosts,
not as such.

549
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,375
You said your dog wouldn't
go near the place.

550
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,020
The way I see it,

551
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,620
when you're scared,
your brain gives off all this fear

552
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,540
and it hangs in the air
and sticks to the walls.

553
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,340
Like this. ARRRRGH!

554
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,420
Did you feel it?
Did you feel it shooting out?

555
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,180
That moment's hanging
in the air now,

556
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,535
like... like a force-field.

557
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,860
That's what's in that place.

558
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,500
That's what the dogs pick up.

559
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,460
So that means...

560
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,220
...something terrible's happened there.

561
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,660
Probably. I tell you where there'd be
another force-field, though.

562
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,100
In a little hotel room in Coota.

563
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100
The one I used to share
with my lady friend

564
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,658
from the 'Spirit of Progress'.

565
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,460
Be a happy one, though.

566
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,940
Room 306, Lord Byron Hotel.

567
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,420
Green bedspread, little gas fire,

568
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,300
picture of the Blue Mountains on the wall

569
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,700
and one of those soft mattresses.

570
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,260
You both sink in together in the middle.

571
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,490
Now, that'd be the place
to take your girlfriend.

572
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,260
What do you reckon
about what he was saying?

573
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,100
I agree. I reckon there's
good and bad places.

574
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,980
Where's a good place?
Willy Hill.

575
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,100
Bet you you can't walk
in a straight line.

576
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,500
Can too.

577
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,580
Should learn to kiss properly,
by the way.

578
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,700
Gail said you were
slobbering all over her.

579
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,180
I was not.

580
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,780
Do it gently next time.

581
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,374
Don't stick your tongue down
someone's throat on the first night.

582
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,340
Just think. Everyone's asleep.

583
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,660
What?
The whole town's out dreaming.

584
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,260
Yeah. Dad would be dreaming
he's pulling beers.

585
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,660
Nils would be dreaming
he's locked in a brewery for the night.

586
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,100
Old Mrs Osmond would be dancing
around with the Duke of Edinburgh.

587
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,731
I wonder if Mrs O'Neil's around.

588
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,060
Her ghost?
Yeah.

589
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,210
Or her force-field.

590
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,971
They're all here, the whole town.

591
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,255
I can feel them too, you know.

592
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,651
Here you go.

593
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,540
How's that horse going, Nils?

594
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,540
Oh, coming along.

595
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,060
Don't say he's gone shin-sore on us.

596
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,860
No, no. He's doing fine.

597
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,700
Setting him up for a first-up killing,
are you, Nils?

598
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,220
Yeah. Yeah, hopefully.

599
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,980
Could be another Phar Lap,
you reckon?

600
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,620
Trainer's doing about as good a job

601
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,420
as Nils is doing with his
eldest bloody daughter.

602
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,660
Well, she's not my daughter, is she?

603
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,096
Seems to have taken a fancy
to young Trevor, I've heard.

604
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,416
Shut up, Tom.

605
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,340
Bob.

606
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,700
Your bloody son's gone and pinched
Mrs Osmond's Mercedes again.

607
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,100
Trying to set up a lap record
round the racetrack.

608
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,060
Jesus, not again.

609
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,376
Come on. Trev, mate!

610
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,300
Chicken!

611
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,420
Well, I'm not gonna chase him.

612
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,940
Just as likely to stack the thing
and kill himself.

613
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,340
Last time he went round
till it ran dry.

614
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,980
Yeah, well, there's not
going to be a next time, Bob.

615
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,732
You know that, don't you?

616
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,260
Trev's gone for a burn
in Mrs Osmond's Mercedes again.

617
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,773
I know where he'll go. Come on.

618
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,540
Trev.

619
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,973
Trev.

620
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,060
He's not here.
They probably caught him.

621
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,493
He'll come.

622
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,340
Trevor!

623
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,940
Trevor!

624
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,579
He's running out
of juice. Get after him!

625
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,573
See ya.

626
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,660
You've got a hernia.

627
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,218
Argh!

628
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,980
What do you want me to do?

629
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,858
Chase after the bastard. Go on!

630
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,260
Fit little bugger, isn't he?

631
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,740
Argh!

632
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,660
Embling wet himself.

633
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,820
How long have you been here?

634
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,340
I just got in round the back.

635
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,490
Why? Did I catch youse cuddling?
Sure.

636
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,620
He said you pinched that car again.

637
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,540
Yeah. Jeez,
that bloody thing can move.

638
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,816
Sergeant Pierce wouldn't
chase me, the bloody chicken.

639
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,380
Welcome to my mansion.
Nice decor.

640
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,690
Yeah, well, I knew you were coming,
so I went to a bit of trouble.

641
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,051
Wonder what lives in here.

642
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,580
Hey, Frey. Have a seat.

643
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,740
Come here. Here.

644
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,180
You gonna stay?
I might.

645
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,820
How do we get rid of Bandy?

646
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,572
Don't call him that. He's alright.

647
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,460
This magazine's from 1946.
When I was born.

648
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,820
Hey, uh... Hey, Bandy,
you going home?

649
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,500
Nah. I'm interested to see
if anything materialises.

650
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,220
What?!

651
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,020
This place.
It's known to be haunted.

652
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,300
By what, mate??
By the ghost of that dead rat?

653
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,499
I'll get some wood for the fire.

654
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,100
How come... How come
you want him to stay?

655
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,060
Why not?

656
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,540
Oh, you know. We could have
this place to ourselves.

657
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,060
How are we gonna...

658
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,660
...you know, if he's around.

659
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,491
We can still do things.

660
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,380
Yeah, well, alright.
Alright, well, we'll sleep in there.

661
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,420
He can sleep in here on the couch.

662
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,820
Let's sleep in front of the fire.

663
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,576
It's gonna be a bloody ripper fire,
mate.

664
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,940
You be warm enough, Danny?

665
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,693
Yeah.

666
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,460
If you keep touching me there,
I'm going to start making a noise.

667
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,260
So?

668
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,889
Be awful for Danny.
How would you feel if you were him?

669
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,620
Oh, you know, if I were him,

670
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,259
I reckon I'd leave us alone
and give us a fair go.

671
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:21,697
I'm not going to do it, anyway.
Not yet.

672
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,180
How come? I mean,
we do everything else.

673
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,660
I mean...

674
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,500
You know,
it's not going to hurt now.

675
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,138
I know it's not going to hurt.

676
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,180
Yeah, well, it's easy
for you, isn't it?

677
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,220
I mean, you can come
just from my fingers, huh?

678
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,180
So can you with mine.

679
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,420
Yeah, but I mean,
it's not the same thing.

680
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,060
You know, it...

681
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,180
...it feels heaps better
when it's inside.

682
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,500
How do you know?
Who else have you done it with?

683
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,650
Er... You can just tell, that's all.

684
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,220
Don't stop.

685
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,900
I thought you were worried about...
Shh.

686
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,940
I thought you were
worried about making a noise.

687
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,090
I'll grit my teeth.

688
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,533
Danny.
Yeah.

689
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,253
It's here, isn't it?

690
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,052
Something is.

691
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,380
Let's go.

692
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,980
Trev.
What? What's on here?

693
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,460
Trev!
Come on. Frey!

694
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,940
What? What's happening?
What did you hear?

695
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,540
It's gonna have
a grip on our brains.

696
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,020
Hurry.

697
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,940
Argh! Bloody caught myself
in the zip.

698
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,620
I don't think it's coming.
Where are they?

699
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,100
Oh, thank God.
What did you hear?

700
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,580
It was there.
What?

701
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,300
Inside the house. We felt it.
What was?

702
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,780
It was there. Something cold.

703
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,700
Course it was cold.

704
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,540
It was freezing 'cause you let
the fire go out, you idiot.

705
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,896
Frey, did you see anything?
Yeah.

706
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,453
Mr Leishman.

707
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,780
Oh, shit.

708
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,260
Well, I hope you're pleased
with yourself.

709
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,100
That Trevor Leishman's a ratbag.

710
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,700
The Olson girl's even worse.
What's wrong with her?

711
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,380
I know you used to be friendly
with her when you were young,

712
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,660
but she's... well, she...

713
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,820
She's older than you now.

714
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,660
I don't see what you can have
in common.

715
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,620
She helps me do my work.

716
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,620
If you're looking for a girlfriend,
look for one your own age.

717
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,420
She's already got a boyfriend.

718
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,456
From what I hear,
she's got too many boyfriends.

719
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,620
<i>Trevor Leishman got sent

720
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,220
<i>to some 'youth training centre'</i>
<i>they called it,

721
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,380
<i>which gave me a chance with Frey.

722
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,060
<i>Not much of a chance, though.

723
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,900
<i>She was set on him now.

724
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,620
Corinna, Corinna...

725
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,420
<i>Maybe hypnotism was my only hope.

726
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,060
<i>Maybe I could get her under my power,

727
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,500
<i>tell her Trevor Leishman</i>
<i>was really a hoon,

728
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,980
<i>a meathead.

729
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,220
<i>The trouble was he'd been OK to me.

730
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,340
I love you so

731
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,060
Whoa, whoa...

732
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:41,540
<i>Then there was that force-field</i>
<i>at the ghost house.

733
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,420
<i>I'd felt it alright,</i>
<i>that night we'd stayed there.

734
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,740
<i>I felt something.

735
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,620
And I could have a word with him

736
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,380
and see if he could get you
something wholesale.

737
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,860
Another good mate
of yours, Nils?

738
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,620
Oh, best of mates. No...

739
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,660
Hey, Tom.
Yeah.

740
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,300
You know that old derelict house
the other side of the railway lines?

741
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,420
Do you remember
who used to live there?

742
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,980
Ha. Do I ever.
Amery, was that their name?

743
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,969
Hey, Bob.

744
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,140
Does anyone remember who used to
live in the old place on the hill?

745
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,580
Well, I don't remember the face.

746
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,780
Never look at the mantelpiece
when you're stoking the fire.

747
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,620
Danny.

748
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,620
Bring up another
half dozen crates, will you?

749
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,214
Good on you, Danny.
We'll be needing them for later, son.

750
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,939
If you want some carrot,
get a whole one out of the fridge.

751
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,020
Who was Sarah Amery?

752
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,580
Who?
Sarah Amery.

753
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,620
She used to live in that spooky place
near the railway line.

754
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,300
She would've died
before you were born.

755
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,540
Did you know her?
No.

756
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,500
But you know about her.

757
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,180
What do you mean, I know about her?

758
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,820
You knew who I was talking about.
Well, I heard when she died.

759
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,500
I mean, you always hear about it
when someone in the area dies.

760
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,730
What did she die of?
I've no idea.

761
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,860
She was only 17.

762
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,740
Was she?

763
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,140
Would Dad know?

764
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,540
You were asking about this
in the pub, weren't you?

765
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,620
Why are you so interested?
I don't know.

766
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,380
I've told you.
I don't know anything about her.

767
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,460
Well, maybe Dad does.

768
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,460
For goodness sake, who put this idea
into your head all of a sudden?

769
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,540
No-one.

770
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,340
Any mail?
No.

771
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,540
I told you Trevor Leishman
wouldn't write.

772
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,260
He probably <i>can't</i> write.
He will.

773
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,100
He's mad. He's also unstable.

774
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,216
That's 'cause he's hyperactive.

775
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,660
Did she sleep with him?
Sally!

776
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,140
I bet she did. Everyone knows.
Oh, how do they know?

777
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,620
All the older kids know.
She's terrible, your sister.

778
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,460
They reckon there's a list
in the boys' toilets

779
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,100
of all the guys who've gone through her.

780
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,100
She's a nymphoniac.

781
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,700
Hello?
Oh, God, I'm gonna hide.

782
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,133
It won't be you he's after.

783
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,090
Hi, Smoochy.
Hi, Sally.

784
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,134
What do you want?
Is, uh, Frey around?

785
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,292
Yeah, I'll get her.

786
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,140
What sort of place
have they got Trevor in?

787
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,540
Miss McColl reckons
it'll be different to a prison.

788
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,820
They'd have classes
and play sport and that.

789
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,820
She doesn't have the address,
though.

790
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,300
What about his old man?

791
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,540
I told him I wanted to write to him
and he told me to piss off.

792
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,820
Said Trev could do without
my influence.

793
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,420
Gee, you must be in such a bad way
hanging around with me.

794
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,420
Don't your parents give you
a hard time about it?

795
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,420
Nah.
Liar.

796
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,340
Given up.
Yeah?

797
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,980
Self-hypnosis.

798
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,700
I could get you to give up, if you want.

799
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,220
Terrible habit.

800
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,700
Terrible for whoever's kissing you.

801
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,577
Yeah, we all know you're the expert.

802
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,900
Did you find out who used to live
at the old ghost house?

803
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,980
It was a woman called Sarah.

804
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,538
Died 16 years ago.

805
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,460
I reckon she might've been
a sort of a prostitute.

806
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,060
In this place?

807
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,500
Well, I asked
some of the blokes in the bar

808
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,650
and they're all carrying on
like it's a big joke.

809
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,100
Alright, see if you can
hypnotise me, then.

810
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,100
I bet you can't.

811
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,660
Alright.

812
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,810
Give us your locket.

813
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,780
Are you relaxed?
Mm-hm.

814
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,214
OK. Now, watch the locket.

815
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,740
Backwards and forwards.

816
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,180
Listen to the sound of my voice.

817
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,820
Gee, you sound professional.

818
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,660
Are you going to
do it properly or not?

819
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,332
OK, I'll do it properly.

820
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:50,779
Watch the locket swinging
backwards and forwards.

821
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,700
Backwards and forwards.

822
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,620
And relax.

823
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,620
Your eyes are getting very heavy.

824
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,900
You are feeling very tired.

825
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:09,220
My voice is very smooth and sleepy.

826
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:13,372
You are so relaxed
that nothing matters at all.

827
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,176
Can you hear me?

828
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,452
Lift your left hand.

829
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,140
And drop it.

830
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,732
Oh, God.

831
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,100
And when you come to,

832
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,020
you'll find that...

833
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,738
...that you're extremely keen on me.

834
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,700
In fact, you'll like me
considerably more

835
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,339
than you like that thug meathead,
Trevor Leishman.

836
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,100
And also,

837
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,818
you'll be wanting to make love to me.

838
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,016
Desperately.

839
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:16,300
And I'm not going to do anything bad,

840
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,292
so just continue to relax.

841
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,620
I wasn't
going to do anything.

842
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,100
I was just...

843
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,900
I wasn't going to try and take
anything off. It was just...

844
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,660
You're hopeless.

845
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:44,020
<i>If it had been anyone else, the whole</i>
<i>school would've been laughing at me.

846
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,060
<i>That was one thing about Freya.

847
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,140
<i>You could really trust her.

848
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,460
<i>You could tell her anything</i>
<i>and she'd always keep it to herself.

849
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,380
<i>But that buggered any chance I had</i>
<i>of taking her to the mid-year dance.

850
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,100
It'll be starting soon.

851
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,580
I know!

852
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,300
Are you going to come and show us?
No.

853
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,380
Dad said you have to come and show us
or you can't go.

854
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,054
Hang on! Give us a look.

855
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,940
You look very nice.

856
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,700
You do look nice, Freya.

857
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,940
Especially the make-up.

858
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,980
When will you be back?

859
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,460
Dawn, maybe.

860
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,940
You'll be home by 11:00.

861
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,534
Yeah, I'll come over the the pub.
You can give me a lift.

862
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,933
Night, Gran.

863
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,180
Hey, Freya. We've got a couple
of beers outside for later.

864
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,580
Gee.
We'll walk you home after.

865
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,260
Oh, yeah?

866
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,420
The sun a bit bright for you,
Embling?

867
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,420
He reckons he's Marlon Brando.
How are you goin', Marlon?

868
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,420
Where's your white stick, Bandy?

869
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,940
Probably been wanking all day.

870
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,660
Oh, God, you two are off.

871
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,900
Hi, sexy.
Hi.

872
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,140
Given up.
Must've been you hypnotising me.

873
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,060
Gee, you're clever.

874
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,780
Are you with anyone?
Myself.

875
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,580
Me too.

876
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,180
I'm pretty pleased with my partner.

877
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,220
Wanna dance?

878
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,336
In a while. Try one of them.

879
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,700
Plenty of time.

880
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,372
Good luck.

881
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,580
Want to dance?
No, thanks.

882
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,260
Arggh!

883
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,216
<i>He'd be doing it to her for sure.

884
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,380
<i>I thought about what Jonah said,

885
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:05,300
<i>that when you have</i>
<i>intense experiences,

886
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,780
<i>your brain gives off energy,

887
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,620
<i>like electricity.

888
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,780
<i>And I tried to pick up hers.

889
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,532
<i>But it didn't work.

890
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,737
What happened to your woman
from Cootamundra?

891
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,053
She went.

892
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,938
Fell in love with another bloke.

893
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,580
Were you sad?

894
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,140
I drank myself into a coma
every night.

895
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,693
Ever think about suicide?

896
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,013
You get over it.

897
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,532
Maybe never completely.
Memory's always there.

898
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,780
But it doesn't eat away at you
like it does at the time.

899
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,850
Is that what your book's about?

900
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,300
Yeah.

901
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,540
Probably be banned, though.

902
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,054
First truly erotic Australian novel.

903
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,020
If we had a special machine,

904
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,260
we could record that force-field,

905
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,900
prove it exists.

906
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,340
They'll have them one day,
machines like that.

907
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:25,340
Do you reckon it's just buildings
that have force-fields?

908
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,092
No, no.

909
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,491
The Abos know all about it.

910
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,290
The whole world's a... a museum.

911
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,899
Everything that's ever happened
in a place, it's all there.

912
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,540
<i>If the whole world's a museum,

913
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,691
<i>an imprint of everything</i>
<i>everyone's done or thought...

914
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,734
<i>... then I knew what kind of force-field</i>
<i>would be in my bedroom.

915
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,776
<i>A museum of desire.

916
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,534
Do you want to come out for a walk?
Oh, yeah, OK.

917
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,618
I came up the fire escape.
I only just got here.

918
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,780
Don't fall.

919
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,860
If I do, I'd take off,

920
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,060
like I do when I dream.

921
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,060
Yeah, I fly a fair bit.

922
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,820
Where do you go?

923
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,020
All over town.

924
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,620
Your place, sometimes.

925
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,620
Do you see me?

926
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,180
Do you?
No.

927
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,774
I don't really see people.
You do, don't you?

928
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:52,140
You know, I reckon
if you believe hard enough,

929
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,340
you could fly when you're awake.

930
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,571
Alright. I'll meet you one night
on Willy Hill and we'll try it.

931
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:02,780
If anyone heard us talking,
they'd think we're mad.

932
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,213
Maybe we are.

933
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,011
Or else everyone else is.

934
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,020
Is Trevor mad like us?

935
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,453
No.

936
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,413
He's sweet, though.

937
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,580
I wanted to tell you something.

938
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,220
What?

939
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:27,260
It'll come out soon for sure
in this dump.

940
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,296
Seeing as you're my friend...

941
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,618
I'm having a kid.

942
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,933
Danny?

943
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,090
Hell.

944
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:51,580
Here.

945
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,340
Danny?

946
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,771
Hey, I'm the one
who should be crying.

947
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,772
I'm hopeless.

948
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,100
That's the first time
you've kissed me since I was six.

949
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,531
Playing doctors and nurses.

950
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,340
You watched me piss.

951
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,898
Then you wouldn't let me watch you.

952
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,020
Yeah.

953
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,976
I was cruel, wasn't I?

954
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,418
This time
I was playing properly.

955
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,620
You don't have to have it, do you?

956
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:51,460
There's places in the cities,
I reckon.

957
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,132
I could come with you.

958
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,900
But I think I want to have it.

959
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,780
'Cause I'm really keen on him.

960
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:16,320
Here.

961
01:05:17,488 --> 01:05:19,843
I thought I lost it.

962
01:05:20,968 --> 01:05:22,688
Look.

963
01:05:22,688 --> 01:05:24,599
"S.E.A".

964
01:05:27,408 --> 01:05:30,928
Sarah Elizabeth Amery.
It must be.

965
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:32,998
Remember?

966
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:36,008
Mrs O'Neil bought it
at the church fete.

967
01:05:36,008 --> 01:05:37,848
From this town.

968
01:05:42,728 --> 01:05:44,688
<i>No holiday</i>
<i>for Halliday...

969
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:50,328
I thought you said Trevor Leishman
never got into Freya Olson's pants.

970
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:51,808
'Cause I don't reckon he did.

971
01:05:51,808 --> 01:05:54,168
How come she's pregnant, then?

972
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:56,368
Where'd you get that from?
Liz Elliot.

973
01:05:56,368 --> 01:05:57,848
Her sister's a nurse.

974
01:05:57,848 --> 01:05:59,328
Could be half of fifth form,
probably.

975
01:06:02,248 --> 01:06:04,408
Here she comes.
Who's the lucky man?

976
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:06,488
Could be Piking, I reckon.

977
01:06:06,488 --> 01:06:08,168
- Is he a squealer?
- - Is he?!

978
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:17,768
<i>It's part of him,</i>
<i>as strong as he.

979
01:06:17,768 --> 01:06:20,408
<i>The power of black magic</i>
<i>is all in the mind of the victim.

980
01:06:20,408 --> 01:06:22,768
<i>That is the civilised theory.

981
01:06:22,768 --> 01:06:26,648
<i>The civilised excuse for the mind</i>
<i>to shy away from the unacceptable.

982
01:06:26,648 --> 01:06:29,288
<i>Alright, what's</i>
<i>your uncivilised theory?

983
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:30,768
It is the spirit...

984
01:06:30,768 --> 01:06:32,608
Are you sure
you want to walk with me?

985
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:34,888
Course I am. Why?
Everyone knows now.

986
01:06:34,888 --> 01:06:36,808
I don't care.

987
01:06:36,808 --> 01:06:38,928
Maybe they'll think I'm the father.

988
01:06:40,648 --> 01:06:43,248
I could marry you.

989
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:45,808
We could get engaged,
pretend it's mine. I don't care.

990
01:06:46,848 --> 01:06:48,804
I don't want to marry anybody.

991
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:54,648
I do... love you.

992
01:06:54,648 --> 01:06:56,408
Danny...

993
01:06:56,408 --> 01:06:58,128
It's still you.

994
01:06:58,128 --> 01:07:00,488
You're no different.

995
01:07:00,488 --> 01:07:02,240
And I'm no different.

996
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:06,038
Thanks for still being my friend.

997
01:07:33,728 --> 01:07:36,368
So your father and I are
going to look after it, are we,

998
01:07:36,368 --> 01:07:38,008
while you finish school?

999
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:39,441
He's not my father.

1000
01:07:41,288 --> 01:07:43,288
Why have you always got it in for us?

1001
01:07:43,288 --> 01:07:44,768
I'll get a job!

1002
01:07:44,768 --> 01:07:46,368
Where are you going to get a job

1003
01:07:46,368 --> 01:07:48,368
where you can have a baby
with you all day?

1004
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:50,168
I'll find one.
Of course.

1005
01:07:50,168 --> 01:07:53,528
It's a marvellous example to Gail.
Stuff Gail.

1006
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,568
What did you say?

1007
01:07:55,568 --> 01:07:57,368
What did you say?!

1008
01:07:57,368 --> 01:07:58,848
Do you know what you've done?

1009
01:07:58,848 --> 01:08:01,088
Do you know what you've done to me,
to this family?

1010
01:08:01,088 --> 01:08:02,608
Leave me alone!

1011
01:08:02,608 --> 01:08:04,564
Leave me alone!

1012
01:08:10,368 --> 01:08:12,688
Did you hear
about Freya Olson?

1013
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,808
- She's exactly like her mother.
- Yeah.

1014
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:19,128
Well, it's... it's in her blood.

1015
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,808
You never told me, did you?

1016
01:08:21,808 --> 01:08:23,808
What?

1017
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,008
If you did it with her.

1018
01:08:26,008 --> 01:08:28,728
What do you mean?

1019
01:08:28,728 --> 01:08:31,048
Well, you know what I mean.

1020
01:08:31,048 --> 01:08:32,888
Every boy in town
started out with her.

1021
01:08:32,888 --> 01:08:34,528
We all knew about it.

1022
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:36,808
And the place on the hill
was like a free brothel.

1023
01:08:36,808 --> 01:08:39,408
I never went near her.

1024
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:40,888
That's not what I heard.

1025
01:08:40,888 --> 01:08:43,888
Oh, she was the town bike.

1026
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:46,128
You wouldn't know
what you might catch.

1027
01:08:46,128 --> 01:08:47,928
It didn't stop anyone else.

1028
01:08:47,928 --> 01:08:51,928
Her father could've been
half the men in town.

1029
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:54,048
Well?!

1030
01:08:54,048 --> 01:08:55,561
Well what?

1031
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,964
Did you?

1032
01:09:00,448 --> 01:09:02,404
I told you I didn't!

1033
01:09:07,248 --> 01:09:08,728
Guess what?

1034
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:11,481
I got Aquanita in the cup sweep.
It's one of the favourites.

1035
01:09:13,368 --> 01:09:16,048
You know Freya Olson's mother?
Yeah, stepmother.

1036
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:17,888
Her real mother.

1037
01:09:17,888 --> 01:09:20,128
I don't think anybody knows
who that was.

1038
01:09:20,128 --> 01:09:21,561
It's Sarah Amery.

1039
01:09:24,688 --> 01:09:26,963
How did you know that?
Found out.

1040
01:09:28,728 --> 01:09:30,528
What happened to her?

1041
01:09:30,528 --> 01:09:32,246
I've no idea.

1042
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:35,088
She died in that house, didn't she?

1043
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,248
I don't know.

1044
01:09:37,248 --> 01:09:39,637
And I think Freya would be
better off not knowing too.

1045
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:44,448
Or does she already know?

1046
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:46,808
That her mother was the town bike?

1047
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:49,288
That's a disgusting expression!

1048
01:09:49,288 --> 01:09:50,848
That's what Dad called her.

1049
01:09:50,848 --> 01:09:52,488
You've been talking
to him about this?

1050
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,968
No.

1051
01:09:53,968 --> 01:09:55,608
Ask him, then!

1052
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,724
God, he'd know better than I would.

1053
01:10:05,928 --> 01:10:08,158
That's it.

1054
01:10:09,568 --> 01:10:11,081
Hello, Danny.

1055
01:10:16,648 --> 01:10:19,808
Mum said you knew
Freya Olson's mother.

1056
01:10:19,808 --> 01:10:21,928
Yeah.

1057
01:10:21,928 --> 01:10:23,361
She used to drink here.

1058
01:10:24,968 --> 01:10:26,401
What was she like?

1059
01:10:27,688 --> 01:10:30,248
Turned up with a bloke
from the railways.

1060
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:33,408
He disappeared. She stayed on.

1061
01:10:33,408 --> 01:10:34,841
Until she died.

1062
01:10:36,568 --> 01:10:38,240
Yeah.

1063
01:10:39,808 --> 01:10:41,878
Had a baby there on her own.

1064
01:10:43,288 --> 01:10:45,728
There were problems.

1065
01:10:45,728 --> 01:10:47,639
They didn't find her until it was too late.

1066
01:10:49,928 --> 01:10:52,368
She was only young.

1067
01:10:52,368 --> 01:10:54,324
Still under-age.

1068
01:10:55,368 --> 01:10:57,808
I didn't know that till afterwards.

1069
01:10:57,808 --> 01:11:00,606
Shouldn't have even been
allowed in the bar.

1070
01:11:06,048 --> 01:11:07,968
Was she wild?

1071
01:11:07,968 --> 01:11:09,799
People used to talk a lot about her.

1072
01:11:11,128 --> 01:11:13,888
You know how it is about this place.

1073
01:11:13,888 --> 01:11:17,328
You take most of it
with a grain of salt.

1074
01:11:17,328 --> 01:11:19,284
All the guys used to
get off with her.

1075
01:11:22,448 --> 01:11:24,245
There was a lot of talk.

1076
01:11:25,568 --> 01:11:28,401
Underneath, she was a really nice kid.

1077
01:11:31,128 --> 01:11:33,164
She was still a kid.

1078
01:11:34,968 --> 01:11:37,328
How come the Olsons adopted Freya?

1079
01:11:37,328 --> 01:11:40,400
Well, somebody had to.
Nils was dobbed in.

1080
01:11:41,728 --> 01:11:43,798
They didn't have any kids
of their own, then.

1081
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:48,201
Dad.

1082
01:11:50,128 --> 01:11:51,880
Did you ever go over there?

1083
01:11:54,408 --> 01:11:55,408
No.

1084
01:11:55,408 --> 01:11:56,841
No, I didn't.

1085
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:07,488
"Blast with cold sleep

1086
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:09,488
"And dazzled by the moon

1087
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:12,368
"Out of the confused,
hammering dark of the train

1088
01:12:12,368 --> 01:12:16,848
"I looked and saw
under the moon's cold sheet

1089
01:12:16,848 --> 01:12:20,328
"The delicate, dry breasts

1090
01:12:20,328 --> 01:12:23,568
"Country that built my heart

1091
01:12:23,568 --> 01:12:26,368
"And the small trees
on their uncoloured slope

1092
01:12:26,368 --> 01:12:29,048
"Like poetry moved

1093
01:12:29,048 --> 01:12:32,528
"Articulate and sharp and purposeful

1094
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:35,408
"Under the great, dry flight of air

1095
01:12:35,408 --> 01:12:39,808
"Under the crosswise currents
of wind and star..."

1096
01:12:39,808 --> 01:12:43,688
Freya. We want to know if Trev's
been in touch with you at all.

1097
01:12:43,688 --> 01:12:45,448
No, he doesn't write letters.

1098
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:48,168
Yeah, but you did see him
on the night of the school dance.

1099
01:12:48,168 --> 01:12:50,088
The two teachers who were
supervising didn't see him.

1100
01:12:50,088 --> 01:12:52,408
Otherwise, of course,
he would've been reported.

1101
01:12:52,408 --> 01:12:55,368
On that night, did he give you any
indication where he might be heading?

1102
01:12:55,368 --> 01:12:56,528
No.

1103
01:12:56,528 --> 01:13:00,088
You mustn't think at any time you're
being asked to dob Trevor in, Freya.

1104
01:13:00,088 --> 01:13:02,408
We want to find him
for his own good.

1105
01:13:02,408 --> 01:13:05,608
You see, he robbed a cafe
at Bibbengullen last night.

1106
01:13:05,608 --> 01:13:09,088
When the proprietor confronted him,
Trevor bashed him.

1107
01:13:09,088 --> 01:13:12,928
Another man's in a serious condition
in hospital.

1108
01:13:12,928 --> 01:13:14,568
How do they know it was Trev?

1109
01:13:14,568 --> 01:13:16,968
Well, he was identified
from a photograph.

1110
01:13:16,968 --> 01:13:20,088
And that means that the whole State
will be looking for him.

1111
01:13:20,088 --> 01:13:25,248
Listen, Freya, I want you to think back
very carefully to that night.

1112
01:13:25,248 --> 01:13:26,728
Did he say anything?

1113
01:13:26,728 --> 01:13:28,248
Did he say anything at all

1114
01:13:28,248 --> 01:13:30,888
that might give you an indication
where he's hiding out?

1115
01:13:30,888 --> 01:13:33,208
Remember, if we can find him,

1116
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,248
we can make sure he's apprehended
without getting hurt.

1117
01:13:36,248 --> 01:13:39,248
If the police out of the district
find him...

1118
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,204
...anything could happen.

1119
01:13:43,328 --> 01:13:45,728
I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough
to come into town.

1120
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:50,528
Those cops, eh?
I still reckon they're after you.

1121
01:13:50,528 --> 01:13:51,961
No way, Bob.

1122
01:13:53,488 --> 01:13:54,921
Pretty dodgy.

1123
01:13:57,288 --> 01:13:59,928
What's going on?

1124
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:03,608
Apparently Trevor was spotted
on the road not far from here.

1125
01:14:03,608 --> 01:14:05,883
It's only a matter of time
before they get him, mate.

1126
01:14:10,088 --> 01:14:12,848
- What's the latest?
- No news.

1127
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,486
I hope he's alright, the poor bugger.

1128
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,488
Arggh!

1129
01:14:42,488 --> 01:14:44,048
Arggh!

1130
01:14:44,048 --> 01:14:45,728
Help! Help!

1131
01:14:45,728 --> 01:14:47,208
Arggh!

1132
01:14:54,368 --> 01:14:56,368
You thought I was a ghost, did you?!

1133
01:15:01,728 --> 01:15:03,208
They're lookin' for you, Trev.

1134
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:05,808
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

1135
01:15:05,808 --> 01:15:08,568
But old Piercey... he wouldn't think
I'd be stupid enough

1136
01:15:08,568 --> 01:15:11,128
to come back to this place,
would he?

1137
01:15:11,128 --> 01:15:13,368
There are a lot of cop cars
in the main street.

1138
01:15:13,368 --> 01:15:15,168
What, are you gonna dob me in,
Embling?

1139
01:15:15,168 --> 01:15:16,648
Of course not.

1140
01:15:19,368 --> 01:15:21,768
I had a feeling you might turn up.

1141
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:23,528
How's Frey?

1142
01:15:23,528 --> 01:15:25,166
She's good.

1143
01:15:27,288 --> 01:15:30,168
You fancy her too, don't you?
No.

1144
01:15:30,168 --> 01:15:32,928
Hey, it's, uh... it's alright.

1145
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:34,839
I don't... I don't blame you,
you know.

1146
01:15:36,088 --> 01:15:39,208
I didn't realise
till that night you stayed here.

1147
01:15:39,208 --> 01:15:40,926
Must've been hard for you.

1148
01:15:43,688 --> 01:15:45,121
She's pregnant.

1149
01:15:46,728 --> 01:15:49,368
What?

1150
01:15:49,368 --> 01:15:51,008
Are you sure?

1151
01:15:51,008 --> 01:15:52,441
Yeah.

1152
01:15:53,808 --> 01:15:56,008
Christ.

1153
01:16:03,528 --> 01:16:07,128
It'd be really dangerous
to take her with you.

1154
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:09,562
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

1155
01:16:12,248 --> 01:16:14,248
I just wanted to see her again.

1156
01:16:14,248 --> 01:16:15,920
That's all.

1157
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:20,088
Would you do that for us?

1158
01:16:20,088 --> 01:16:22,283
Would you go and get her for me?

1159
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:27,323
You think
I'm gonna piss off with her?

1160
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,760
I'd like to, but...

1161
01:16:32,488 --> 01:16:34,080
...no, I won't.

1162
01:16:35,528 --> 01:16:37,644
Especially if she's got a kid coming.

1163
01:16:38,848 --> 01:16:40,804
Yeah, alright.

1164
01:16:42,968 --> 01:16:44,560
Thanks, mate.

1165
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,724
Hey, uh, Danny.

1166
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:51,400
Is it my kid or yours?

1167
01:16:53,048 --> 01:16:55,039
Yours.

1168
01:17:06,528 --> 01:17:08,883
Here's the new boyfriend.

1169
01:17:50,288 --> 01:17:53,803
So, you're, um...
you're having a kid?

1170
01:17:55,848 --> 01:17:58,088
Are you glad?

1171
01:17:58,088 --> 01:17:59,521
Yeah.

1172
01:18:01,368 --> 01:18:02,848
Even...

1173
01:18:02,848 --> 01:18:05,568
Even though the father's a no-hoper?

1174
01:18:05,568 --> 01:18:07,524
So is the mother.

1175
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:11,320
Best of both worlds.

1176
01:18:12,368 --> 01:18:14,279
What are you gonna do?

1177
01:18:15,328 --> 01:18:17,608
I don't know. Um...

1178
01:18:17,608 --> 01:18:19,328
I'll go up north, I s'pose.

1179
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:22,568
Some place called Dampier.

1180
01:18:22,568 --> 01:18:25,528
They reckon you can get work there,
no questions.

1181
01:18:25,528 --> 01:18:28,768
I talked to a couple of guys where
they used to put us in the lockup.

1182
01:18:28,768 --> 01:18:31,487
They said that was
the place to go.

1183
01:18:33,888 --> 01:18:36,561
Hey, I didn't mean to
hurt that guy in the cafe.

1184
01:18:37,928 --> 01:18:39,486
I know you didn't.

1185
01:18:43,528 --> 01:18:44,961
Did you miss me?

1186
01:18:49,288 --> 01:18:51,006
A bit.

1187
01:18:58,768 --> 01:19:00,645
Danny! Over here, son.

1188
01:19:01,688 --> 01:19:03,288
Trev! Cops!

1189
01:19:03,288 --> 01:19:04,768
Shit!

1190
01:19:04,768 --> 01:19:07,248
Stay here, alright?
There's a whole lot of them.

1191
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:09,168
That's OK, I've got a ute
in the garage.

1192
01:19:09,168 --> 01:19:12,568
Trevor! You're putting other people
at risk now, son.

1193
01:19:12,568 --> 01:19:14,048
People you care about.

1194
01:19:14,048 --> 01:19:16,048
- I'm coming with you.
- - Nah, no way.

1195
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:18,248
I'm coming with you!
No, no!

1196
01:19:18,248 --> 01:19:21,088
Nah, nah, look...
Look, you stay with Danny, OK?

1197
01:19:21,088 --> 01:19:23,208
He's alright, huh?
Trev!

1198
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:26,328
Hey, I'll be alright.

1199
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:27,761
I'm lucky, remember?

1200
01:19:30,128 --> 01:19:31,561
I got you.

1201
01:19:34,808 --> 01:19:36,764
We're coming in, Trevor.

1202
01:19:50,848 --> 01:19:52,964
Get out of the way!

1203
01:19:55,648 --> 01:19:57,728
You'll get squashed against
the fence, you bloody idiot.

1204
01:19:57,728 --> 01:19:59,448
Arggh! Fuck off!

1205
01:19:59,448 --> 01:20:01,688
Arggh! Bastard!

1206
01:20:01,688 --> 01:20:04,043
Get in the car!
Get after him!

1207
01:20:06,088 --> 01:20:08,044
Get into your bloody cars!

1208
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:16,641
Whoo!

1209
01:20:17,848 --> 01:20:20,848
Yeah, yeah,
I understand that, Nils.

1210
01:20:20,848 --> 01:20:23,999
Sure. Yeah.
Just calm down, will you?

1211
01:20:25,048 --> 01:20:27,488
Listen, Nils, I don't wanna hear that.

1212
01:20:27,488 --> 01:20:30,808
From out of the east
a stranger came...

1213
01:20:30,808 --> 01:20:32,808
Look, it's no use
carrying on to me about it.

1214
01:20:32,808 --> 01:20:35,488
Law book in his hand...
There's not a lot I can do!

1215
01:20:35,488 --> 01:20:38,208
A man
The kind of man...

1216
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,688
Settle down, will you?!

1217
01:20:39,688 --> 01:20:43,008
The West would need
to tame a troubled land

1218
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,648
'Cause the point of the gun

1219
01:20:44,648 --> 01:20:50,248
Was the only law
that Liberty understood

1220
01:20:50,248 --> 01:20:54,488
'Cause when it came to
shootin' straight and fast

1221
01:20:54,488 --> 01:20:56,956
He was mighty

1222
01:20:58,608 --> 01:21:00,808
Good.

1223
01:21:00,808 --> 01:21:03,208
G'day, Bruce. He's all yours, mate.

1224
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,641
Thanks, Dave.

1225
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:27,768
We're gonna have to
drop her off ourselves.

1226
01:21:27,768 --> 01:21:29,408
The Olsons won't pick her up.

1227
01:21:29,408 --> 01:21:31,558
They don't wanna have
anything to do with her.

1228
01:22:12,888 --> 01:22:14,560
You never stop, do you?

1229
01:22:16,928 --> 01:22:19,528
It's 'cause you can't.

1230
01:22:19,528 --> 01:22:21,519
You just can't help it, can you?

1231
01:23:29,288 --> 01:23:32,168
Um... I've...

1232
01:23:32,168 --> 01:23:33,726
...got some rather sad news.

1233
01:23:36,728 --> 01:23:40,288
Trevor Leishman, who you all know
was badly injured

1234
01:23:40,288 --> 01:23:44,048
when his car ran off the road last night,

1235
01:23:44,048 --> 01:23:46,198
died a short time ago.

1236
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:53,688
Excuse me, miss,
I gotta go somewhere.

1237
01:23:53,688 --> 01:23:55,440
Certainly, Danny.

1238
01:24:03,808 --> 01:24:05,648
Hi, Mrs Olson.

1239
01:24:05,648 --> 01:24:08,082
Danny.
Is Freya home?

1240
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:10,959
Haven't seen her
since this morning.

1241
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:15,208
Have you heard about
Trevor Leishman?

1242
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:16,641
Yeah.

1243
01:24:18,008 --> 01:24:19,521
What a waste.

1244
01:24:24,168 --> 01:24:25,760
See you later.

1245
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:12,207
What number?
295, please.

1246
01:25:18,408 --> 01:25:21,688
Yeah?
Mr Olson, is Freya back yet?

1247
01:25:21,688 --> 01:25:23,208
No.

1248
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:25,208
Do you know where she is?

1249
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:26,766
No.

1250
01:25:43,168 --> 01:25:45,636
Ow.

1251
01:25:53,768 --> 01:25:55,568
God.

1252
01:26:59,768 --> 01:27:02,368
Freya!

1253
01:27:02,368 --> 01:27:04,120
Frey!

1254
01:27:08,088 --> 01:27:09,601
Frey!

1255
01:27:49,368 --> 01:27:51,488
What are you doing
over there?

1256
01:27:51,488 --> 01:27:54,168
- Just going to the loo.
- - You shouldn't be out of bed.

1257
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,601
You haven't even got
your slippers on.

1258
01:27:59,088 --> 01:28:00,088
Hi.

1259
01:28:00,088 --> 01:28:01,521
Hi.

1260
01:28:08,928 --> 01:28:10,361
Thanks.

1261
01:28:13,928 --> 01:28:15,441
You can kiss me.

1262
01:28:19,408 --> 01:28:22,288
It's nice to get a proper visitor.

1263
01:28:22,288 --> 01:28:24,927
How are you?
Good.

1264
01:28:26,088 --> 01:28:28,568
What's everyone saying at school?

1265
01:28:28,568 --> 01:28:29,568
Not much.

1266
01:28:29,568 --> 01:28:31,001
Yeah, for sure.

1267
01:28:34,368 --> 01:28:37,968
They said I could've died
'cause I got so cold.

1268
01:28:37,968 --> 01:28:39,401
How come you knew?

1269
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:45,476
It works. Doesn't it?

1270
01:28:50,888 --> 01:28:52,368
What did your folks say?

1271
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:54,088
Nothing, hardly.

1272
01:28:54,088 --> 01:28:56,008
They're not MY folks, anyway.

1273
01:28:56,008 --> 01:28:57,964
Never were.

1274
01:28:59,288 --> 01:29:01,040
Do you want me to go?

1275
01:29:04,368 --> 01:29:06,165
Not if you don't want to.

1276
01:29:14,168 --> 01:29:18,047
It's just the baby was
the only part of Trev I had left.

1277
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:44,760
He took 100 pounds of clay

1278
01:29:45,808 --> 01:29:48,208
And then he said

1279
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:50,888
"Hey, listen,

1280
01:29:50,888 --> 01:29:56,008
"I'm gonna fix this a-world today

1281
01:29:56,008 --> 01:29:58,648
"Because I know

1282
01:29:58,648 --> 01:30:01,048
"What's missin"'

1283
01:30:01,048 --> 01:30:05,280
So he rolled his big sleeves up

1284
01:30:06,368 --> 01:30:10,928
And a brand-new world began

1285
01:30:10,928 --> 01:30:12,998
He create...

1286
01:30:29,848 --> 01:30:32,316
When did you get out?
This arvo.

1287
01:30:34,728 --> 01:30:36,808
Shouldn't you be taking it easy?

1288
01:30:36,808 --> 01:30:39,408
Can't take it easy at home.

1289
01:30:39,408 --> 01:30:41,717
Is it bad there?
It's finished.

1290
01:30:42,768 --> 01:30:45,488
You can stay here. I'll talk to Dad.

1291
01:30:45,488 --> 01:30:47,888
I couldn't stay anywhere
in this place now.

1292
01:30:47,888 --> 01:30:50,248
Hello, Freya.

1293
01:30:50,248 --> 01:30:52,168
You OK again?
Yeah.

1294
01:30:52,168 --> 01:30:53,648
I'm just going, Mr Embling.

1295
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:55,808
Oh, I could give you a lift.
It's alright.

1296
01:30:55,808 --> 01:30:57,768
I'll walk her home, Dad.

1297
01:30:57,768 --> 01:30:59,565
Sure.

1298
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:15,368
What's the matter?

1299
01:31:15,368 --> 01:31:18,519
Did they ever tell you
anything about your mother?

1300
01:31:20,728 --> 01:31:23,648
Only that she died
not long after I was born.

1301
01:31:23,648 --> 01:31:25,648
I don't know anything about her.

1302
01:31:25,648 --> 01:31:27,928
Why?

1303
01:31:27,928 --> 01:31:29,964
That's where she lived.

1304
01:31:31,888 --> 01:31:33,844
She was Sarah.

1305
01:31:39,088 --> 01:31:41,408
How do you know?

1306
01:31:41,408 --> 01:31:44,047
I heard people talking about it
at the pub.

1307
01:31:47,528 --> 01:31:49,325
What happened?

1308
01:31:51,008 --> 01:31:53,008
She was living out there alone.

1309
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:54,600
No-one was around...

1310
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:57,839
...when she had you.

1311
01:32:13,248 --> 01:32:15,364
Thanks, I'll be OK now.

1312
01:33:45,888 --> 01:33:47,568
Where will you stay?

1313
01:33:47,568 --> 01:33:49,088
Some hotel.

1314
01:33:49,088 --> 01:33:52,928
Got a fair bit of money from
the hay baling - saved it all.

1315
01:33:52,928 --> 01:33:54,488
Here.

1316
01:33:54,488 --> 01:33:56,288
Come off it.
Where'd you get that?

1317
01:33:56,288 --> 01:33:58,279
Tips and stuff.
It's yours.

1318
01:33:59,448 --> 01:34:01,768
Take it.

1319
01:34:01,768 --> 01:34:04,888
That way you'll have to
write to me at least once.

1320
01:34:04,888 --> 01:34:06,888
I'll write to you.

1321
01:34:06,888 --> 01:34:10,048
Maybe we can send messages again,
like we used to.

1322
01:34:10,048 --> 01:34:12,768
By telepathy?
Yeah.

1323
01:34:12,768 --> 01:34:15,328
I don't know if it could work
over a long distance.

1324
01:34:15,328 --> 01:34:17,683
We'll make it work, be pioneers.

1325
01:34:18,728 --> 01:34:21,448
Monday nights?
Midnight on Monday nights.

1326
01:34:21,448 --> 01:34:22,928
It's a deal.

1327
01:34:22,928 --> 01:34:25,208
Are you really going?

1328
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:27,088
Yeah.

1329
01:34:27,088 --> 01:34:29,648
Well, what am I gonna tell
Mum and Dad?

1330
01:34:29,648 --> 01:34:32,488
They won't care.
Not for long, anyway.

1331
01:34:32,488 --> 01:34:34,488
How long will you go for?

1332
01:34:34,488 --> 01:34:36,168
Dunno.

1333
01:34:36,168 --> 01:34:38,168
Frey...

1334
01:34:38,168 --> 01:34:40,284
...I don't want you to go.

1335
01:34:42,488 --> 01:34:44,080
I have to.

1336
01:34:55,608 --> 01:34:57,041
Danny.

1337
01:35:02,768 --> 01:35:06,397
I'll let you hypnotise me again...
one day.

1338
01:36:52,328 --> 01:36:56,288
<i>I hung around a lot</i>
<i>at our place on Willy Hill.

1339
01:36:56,288 --> 01:36:58,768
<i>Maybe there's</i>
<i>a positive force-field up there

1340
01:36:58,768 --> 01:37:01,680
<i>'cause we'd had</i>
<i>a lot of good times together.

1341
01:37:02,728 --> 01:37:05,401
<i>Maybe there's a part of her</i>
<i>still there too.

1342
01:37:12,768 --> 01:37:15,123
<i>But I knew she'd never come back.
