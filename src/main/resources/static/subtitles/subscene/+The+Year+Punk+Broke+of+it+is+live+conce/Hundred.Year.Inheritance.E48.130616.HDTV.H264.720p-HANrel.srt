<i>Episode 48</i>

2
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:13,761
Because you've cheered me on,

3
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:16,438
I truly

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,972
will be brave.

5
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,876
Stop it now.

00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:45,829
<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Inheritance Team@Viki.</i>

7
00:00:57,868 --> 00:01:00,451
Did you guys have a fight?

8
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,711
Since you're here, you should pay your respect to Grandfather, and

9
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,997
have some noodle before you go.

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,717
The mood between the two seems very cold.

11
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:19,460
Father, Se Yoon is here.

12
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,983
Aigoo.

13
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:24,184
He always said there is no one else except Se Yoon for grandson-in-law.

14
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,005
That's how much he liked you.

15
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:37,361
I am sorry for coming so late.

16
00:01:39,694 --> 00:01:43,772
Thank you for coming when you're very busy.

17
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:44,978
Grandfather

18
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:49,210
went to a good place, a peaceful place.

19
00:02:03,628 --> 00:02:06,224
Aigoo, Grandfather.

20
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:09,057
Why are you over there?

21
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:12,046
Husband Kim is here.

22
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:16,498
The one who only gave you worries,

23
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:20,495
Cheol Gyoo, the miscreant who can't even behave properly as a person.

24
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:23,419
Husband Kim is here, Grandfather.

25
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,036
Aigoo.

26
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:26,147
This brat!

27
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,537
Why is he like this?

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,546
Ki Choon, Ki Choon.

29
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:36,317
Let him be. Let him be.

30
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:49,347
I didn't know you were this ill, not even in my dream.

31
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:54,322
If I knew you were, before you passed away,

32
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:56,744
I would have brought you

33
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:00,939
sweet red bean jelly that you liked so much.

34
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,600
Aigoo, Grandfather.

35
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:11,572
Please forgive your undutiful child... Grandpa.

36
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:15,700
This brat, he's making me cry.

37
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,000
I know.

38
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:20,467
He still has sentimental attachments.

39
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:27,683
You...

40
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:30,298
Let's have a chat.

41
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,619
Yes.

42
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:42,136
Grandfather...

43
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:55,576
How is your mother?

44
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:58,078
She have recovered a lot.

45
00:03:58,078 --> 00:04:01,368
You should stay by her and give her strength.

46
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,604
I've told you before,

47
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:06,396
the one who gave birth to you is your mother,

48
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:09,503
and the one who raised you is also your mother.

49
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:11,164
Yes.

50
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:13,790
By the way,

51
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,114
mother has yet...

52
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:17,809
Yes,

53
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:20,384
I haven't heard from her.

54
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:25,348
I sent a letter telling her that Chae Won's grandfather has passed away.

55
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,692
Will she come now,

56
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:27,703
or will she come later,

57
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:29,904
I've been waiting like that...

58
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:32,082
By the look of it,

59
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:34,987
I guess she isn't coming.

60
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:37,181
I...

61
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,871
Father.

62
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,578
Truthfully, I am

63
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:46,997
leaving this Friday for United States.

64
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:51,073
I've been assigned to a branch in the U.S.

65
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:56,962
Does Chae Won know about this?

66
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,480
Yes.

67
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:02,804
I was hoping that she would tell me not to go.

68
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:06,750
But she didn't even move a muscle.

69
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,657
Thank you for coming.

70
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:22,346
Please eat and let me know, if there is anything lacking.

71
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,482
I'll be going.

72
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,082
Yes.

73
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:42,655
Go safely.

74
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:48,432
Before I leave for the American branch,

75
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:52,208
we might not see each other again,

76
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,647
so I'll say my good bye in advance.

77
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,631
Take care of your health

78
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:02,429
and be well.

79
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:09,525
You too,

80
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:13,727
be healthy and be well.

81
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,202
Of course.

82
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:19,335
I must do that.

83
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,178
Take care.

84
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:31,522
<i>♫ I don't know why I started loving you.</i>

85
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:35,416
<i>♫ My longing for you becomes unbearable.</i>

86
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,963
<i>♫ I can't forget you.</i>

87
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:41,861
<i>♫ I still</i>

88
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:47,993
<i>♫ only love you.</i>

89
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:52,871
I ate well. I'll be going.

90
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,528
Goodbye.

91
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,437
Lee Se Yoon, that jerk,

92
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:59,166
is going to America.

93
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:03,485
You must have been distressed during this period.

94
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:05,399
Don't be concerned with other people's business.

95
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,907
Just take care of yourself.

96
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:10,426
I am not the old Kim Cheol Gyoo.

97
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:13,837
Wait and see, with my name, I'll make an awesome comeback,

98
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,744
and I will definitely appear and stand before you.

99
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,729
These are not empty words.

100
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,100
Soon I will definitely show you the changed me.

101
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:52,397
<i>They say if old people's eyes are not clear,</i>

102
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:57,539
<i>you're at heaven's doorstep.</i>

103
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,730
<i>Do you think you'll live long?</i>

104
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,865
<i>Of course, I will.<br>I'll live 20 years longer than you.</i>

105
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,785
<i>Are you senile?</i>

106
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:10,268
<i>To this rude bastard and thief, you call him "Son-in-law Kang.</i>

107
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:12,082
<i>Are you demented?</i>

108
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:14,758
Please stop mom.

109
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,869
Without a clue,

110
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,295
he, who's ill...

111
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:22,878
I tormented him.

112
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,606
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:28,173
Aigoo, I was wrong, husband.

114
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:31,406
If you have any disappointments, please let it all out before leaving.

115
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:35,451
I'll be following you shortly.

116
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:49,122
Please calm down, Grandmother.

117
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,032
Your grandfather,

118
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:55,072
when the thought of how much he must've been lonely and sad,

119
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:59,467
my insides are burning.

120
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,312
Even if no one else, at least,

121
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:05,655
I should have known, since we slept under the same blanket and ate together.

122
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,800
I was too unconcerned.

123
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:11,531
I did wrong... Honey...

124
00:09:12,323 --> 00:09:15,597
Father-in-law left with full understanding.

125
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,971
You shouldn't torment your heart.

126
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:20,549
That's right.

127
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:21,929
Father...

128
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,345
probably thought all those things were charming.

129
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,114
I am sorry.

130
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:32,192
I'll accept all the punishment for my sins, later when I get to heaven.

131
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:49,791
Is it because you are of lesser quality?

132
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,221
Your class is totally low,

133
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:53,223
way down low.

134
00:09:53,223 --> 00:09:56,512
How can such an elegant and precious person...

135
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,784
What's in this neighborhood

136
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:00,641
for a person like you to come?

137
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,197
Look at this fishwife, who are you sassing with dripping sarcasm?

138
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,118
Forget it.

139
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:07,869
Call for a person tomorrow

140
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,431
and ask for maintenance. Got it?

141
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:11,797
They said the one who's thirsty should dig the well

142
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:14,348
you buy the material and paste it!

143
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,367
Is this woman crazy?

144
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,820
Why should I ask for maintenance because of you?

145
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,104
Why on earth should I pay out of my pocket when the problem comes from the old house?

146
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:26,494
Then, the water falling from our living room ceiling

147
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:28,409
has nothing to do with you?

148
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,814
I have nothing to do with it, of course!

149
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:34,049
You... This iron masked (thick face) wench!

150
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:34,877
Oh my!

151
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:35,974
Let go!

152
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:37,695
Hey!

153
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,541
Hey!

154
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,085
Aigoo, why are you like this?

155
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:44,536
Calm down Mom!

156
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:50,137
What in the world...?<br>I'm speechless.

157
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:58,412
Aigoo...aigoo. These low class people...

158
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:01,184
Wait a minute. If water leaked from their bathroom

159
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:02,883
which dripped downstairs

160
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:03,785
and it caused damage

161
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,695
then naturally, with certainty,

162
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:08,775
they should repair. How dare she put out a duck pad (pretend innocence)?

163
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,497
Stop Mom,

164
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:14,195
You're going to be registered as the fighter within days of moving to this neighborhood, my mom!

165
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,023
Aigoo, aigoo! Hey!

166
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:19,373
What does it matter, as soon as we catch that con man,

167
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:22,316
we will be leaving this place without looking back!

168
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:26,226
Wait a minute, that household!

169
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,403
Aigoo. Aigoo. Mom.

170
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:29,340
Hold back. Hold back.

171
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,101
Aigoo, so not in the same class!

172
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:33,373
Aigoo, aigoo.

173
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:51,992
<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Inheritance Team@Viki</i>

174
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:54,775
You've been in your room this entire time, what have you been doing?

175
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:57,674
Come out and talk with mom.

176
00:11:57,674 --> 00:11:59,826
I don't want to be bothered.

177
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,573
Lee Se Yoon is leaving for the American branch.

178
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:05,844
American branch?

179
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:06,661
Yeah.

180
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:08,617
He's leaving this week.

181
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:09,838
With "Zero"?

182
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,228
Why would my Chae Won go with him?

183
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:13,159
He's going by himself.

184
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,846
If I knew it was going to be like this,

185
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:18,281
I should have stayed by Sunbae's side quietly.

186
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,915
About now, since the situation changed,

187
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:23,480
we could have talked about marriage.

188
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,566
What's the point in talking about the past?

189
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,311
If you and "Zero" didn't get divorced,

190
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:31,825
there wouldn't have been a chance for "Zero" and Sunbae to meet.

191
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:34,834
Then I wouldn't have ruined the noodle project.

192
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,194
Then,

193
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,943
the company wouldn't get ruined.

194
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:52,472
Did you meet with your mom?

195
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,839
No.

196
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,381
Does she not know...

197
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:57,178
that Grandfather passed away?

198
00:12:57,178 --> 00:13:00,837
Father said that he left a voice message for her.

199
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:06,228
Just where is she? Why doesn't she call?

200
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:08,761
How is your body doing?

201
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,448
It's doing better.

202
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,650
What about Chae Won?

203
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,463
Did you see her?

204
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:20,849
I'm

205
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:22,701
going to go up and rest.

206
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,442
Oh... Ok.

207
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:44,050
<i> Did you not hear that Father-in-law passed away? </i>

208
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,877
<i>He worried about you and missed you</i>

209
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:49,501
<i>to the last moment he passed away.</i>

210
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:51,405
<i>The burial is tomorrow.</i>

211
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:52,616
<i> Come quickly.</i>

212
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:55,428
<i> Bid your final farewell. </i>

213
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,617
<i> I'll wait. </i>

214
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,471
I'm sorry, Father.

215
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,872
I can't see you while you're leaving far away.

216
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:15,151
I've failed in my filial duty.

217
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:21,207
Oh my word, Father!

218
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,737
Father, forgive me.

219
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,707
Father.

220
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,479
This factory is the place

221
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:20,726
where you, Father, dedicated your entire life.

222
00:15:20,726 --> 00:15:24,552
Please look around for the last time.

223
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:34,610
Aigoo.

224
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,417
<i> If there wasn't this factory that was passed down for a 100 years,</i>

225
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:42,819
<i> there wouldn't be a chance for all of you to be here. </i>

226
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:45,590
<i> Please buy some noodles. </i>

227
00:15:57,061 --> 00:16:00,024
<i> Subtitles brought to you by <br>The Inheritance Team @Viki </i>

228
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:11,494
<i> I...</i>

229
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:13,235
<i> think that you</i>

230
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:16,677
<i> should inherit this factory. </i>

231
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,309
Thank you.

232
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,070
You've accomplished a big feat.

233
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,284
We've won at the contest,

234
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:24,530
because of our noodle's superior taste.

235
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,885
In reality, it's your cooking skill that saved our family business.

236
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:48,154
Father,

237
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,770
we'll take good care of you.

238
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,455
Don't worry about a thing.

239
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,143
Father-in-law.

240
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:58,966
The weather today is also very good.

241
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,993
Then.

242
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:03,787
Let's start leaving.

243
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:27,175
Take me with you, too! <br><i>"Uh-hah, uh-hah (chant in funeral process)</i>

244
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:42,296
(colorful flags usually contained guarding the deceased)<i>Uh-ha~ (mourning song &amp; chant)</i>

245
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:51,985
Aigoo! Aigoo! Let me go, too!

246
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,782
<br>

247
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,706
Aiyoo. This place is cold.

248
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:25,739
How could I leave you in there by yourself?

249
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:28,010
Let me go with you.

250
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,484
Stay with me.

251
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,412
I'll stay by your side.

252
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,695
Mom, if you're like this...

253
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:41,391
Father won't be able to...

254
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:42,982
He won't be able to leave!

255
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,900
Mother.

256
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:48,698
Please let Father leave comfortably.

257
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:51,131
I can't let him go like this.

258
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,932
I can't let your father go like this.

259
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,829
Mother.

260
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:56,416
Grandmother.

261
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,311
Mom!

262
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:00,286
Ok.

263
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,324
Ok, calm down.

264
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:03,496
Shovel up some dirt,

265
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:05,952
and put it over your father.

266
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:06,837
Yes.

267
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:08,847
Wait a minute.

268
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,124
This is,

269
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,644
Grandfather's favorite kind of noodles.

270
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,526
I want to send this before he leaves.

271
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:36,030
Aigoo.

272
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,260
This noodle...I'm sick to death to this.

273
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,104
Isn't it enough that you've seen it all your life that

274
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:46,961
now you would take it even to your death!

275
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,973
My thought is

276
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:52,175
father-in-law will

277
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:53,650
even in after-life

278
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,520
make noodles

279
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,144
to feed the hungry.

280
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,735
What I'm thinking is right, Father-in-Law?

281
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,307
Of course!

282
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:06,338
I could see my father doing just that.

283
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:08,860
Father,

284
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:11,794
we'll work hard at the factory,

285
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,086
and Mom will eat well.

286
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:17,149
Don't worry about anything here.

287
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,615
Please leave well, Father.

288
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,600
Yes, dad.

289
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,947
I, too,

290
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:27,224
will get my act together and

291
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:30,168
live well.

292
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
It would have been good if you left after you saw the baby in my stomach.

293
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,800
I'm thankful...

294
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:48,803
The promise I made with you to meet in 50 years

295
00:20:48,803 --> 00:20:52,630
I'll absolutely keep it.

296
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,297
Grandfather, I love you.

297
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:01,187
Grandfather, I miss you.

298
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,271
Grandfather,

299
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:08,133
you were my life's best teacher.

300
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,900
Thank you, Grandfather.

301
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:39,401
Bro...Brother in law! Brother in law!

302
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,865
What's wrong?

303
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:46,326
That... That...

304
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:06,758
I came, Unni.

305
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:09,266
You came early.

306
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:11,410
Were there a lot of customers?

307
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,637
Was it because of the hot weather? It seemed like only flies came in.

308
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,526
Did the funeral go well?

309
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,005
Yeah..

310
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,723
I guess.

311
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:23,157
Welcome.

312
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:29,537
Hyo Dong.

313
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:47,162
Drink this.

314
00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:50,683
How can a person do that?

315
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,945
You knew my feelings very well...

316
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:57,629
How could you be so harsh, cruel, and

317
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,534
end it like that?

318
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,883
Weren't you worried about me at all?

319
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:08,718
Why wouldn't I worry?

320
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:11,037
I worried a lot.

321
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,459
A worried person

322
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:17,845
would just give a call that the divorce paper is ready and needs to be stamped?

323
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,577
And don't keep in touch at all?

324
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:21,714
I had no other choice.

325
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,946
Please understand me.

326
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:26,399
If I happened to seen you at the funeral,

327
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:28,362
for a lifetime,

328
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:30,958
were you planning on not contacting me ever again?

329
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,458
Then what was I supposed to do?

330
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:40,962
If I could only sacrifice myself,<br> then my children would be happy.

331
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,042
Since I became a mother,

332
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:45,178
should I take care of my greediness

333
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:47,543
and ignore my children?

334
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:50,495
Who said to ignore them?

335
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:54,962
I just said to give it time and think about it.

336
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:59,175
My kids are crying blood, how can I look the other way?

337
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:03,403
Anyways,

338
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:08,334
since we met like this, I won't go back alone.

339
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:16,222
Just so you know, no matter what happens, you will be returning home with me.

340
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:22,878
What are you doing right now?

341
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,461
Come back home with me.

342
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:33,339
Choon Hee.

343
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:38,711
When I left home, leaving you and my family behind,

344
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:41,591
I made up all of my mind.

345
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:43,458
I'm being sincere.

346
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:46,666
So, just go back.

347
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,247
In order to let the children marry,

348
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:02,927
Choon Hee said she signed the divorce papers and left.

349
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:05,491
She signed divorce papers?

350
00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:08,090
If she wasn't Chae Won's mom,

351
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,757
then the wedding between Se Yoon and Chae Won has no problem.

352
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,535
She said she would sacrifice herself.

353
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:18,253
If I killed Choon Hee 30 years ago, then

354
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:21,549
this time, you're the one doing it.

355
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:26,725
The kids are not even related by blood.<br> There are no legal problems.

356
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,406
You just have to give your consent.

357
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,127
Don't lecture me.

358
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:35,183
It's against my values and ways of life.

359
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:39,066
Because of your principle oriented personality,

360
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:42,293
Choon Hee is forcing herself to part from Chae Won's father.

361
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:44,667
And, you're making the children

362
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:47,265
break up in the end?

363
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:50,295
You're saying it's all my fault?

364
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:53,811
Because of who, do you think this happened?

365
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:57,277
Again, you're talking about the problem's origin.

366
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,465
I understand.

<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Inheritance Team @ Viki</i>

368
00:26:18,322 --> 00:26:19,713
Yes?

369
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:32,481
Why are you...?

370
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:43,043
I heard that you were going to America.

371
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:47,825
I wanted to see you once before you left, so that I could apologize.

372
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:53,180
I know you probably won't be able to forgive me with this one word.

373
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:58,430
I took the researchers from your company, and

374
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,923
using bad intentions and cheating with my factory.

375
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:03,604
I'm really sorry.

376
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:05,712
I was wrong.

377
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,674
Because I was betrayed by you,

378
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:13,159
I resorted to anything, and only thought to get revenge on you.

379
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:17,646
In the end, I received this punishment.

380
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,796
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:21,796 --> 00:27:25,050
I hurt you also.

382
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,960
Let's forget everything that happened and just start anew.

383
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,447
We should do that.

384
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,574
What about work?

385
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:36,144
I'm looking into it but it's not too easy.

386
00:27:36,943 --> 00:27:38,532
But...

387
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,798
I heard you're transferring to the American branch.

388
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,003
It turned out that way.

389
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:44,339
If you leave this time, when will you be returning?

390
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,860
Who knows!

391
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,542
Whenever my heart becomes clear,

392
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:51,395
I'll be there until then.

393
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:01,506
The name is Hong Jong Goo.

394
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:04,343
He previously worked as a lawyer.

395
00:28:04,343 --> 00:28:10,396
That person stole all of my property!

396
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:16,860
If you can only find that rotten person, I will pay you well for the service.

397
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,507
Huh?

398
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:21,587
The undertaking fee is 5,000,000 Won?

399
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:28,027
Aigoo... No... The undertaking fee is 5 million won...

400
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:32,780
Then, instead of doing that, when you find that person,

401
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,734
I'll give you 1/100th of all of the things that he stole from me.

402
00:28:36,911 --> 00:28:40,667
Aigoo, if you change the worth of it to money,

403
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,259
its value is very big!

404
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:48,251
Then, I'll generously give you 1/50th of my stolen assets.

405
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:49,947
Hello?

406
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,835
H-Hello?!

407
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,731
Oh no.

408
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:59,782
He is a genuine thief, just without a knife.

409
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:04,240
To just find one person, he's demanding so much money.

410
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,026
We already gave so much money to the detective agency. Stop here, Mom.

411
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:11,583
Aigoo.

412
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,587
What have you been doing since before?

413
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:18,612
I was writing my resume.

414
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:22,296
If I pass this out and beg every sunbae or hoobae I'm acquainted with,

415
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:25,076
I'm sure we'll hear some good news.

416
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:26,420
Aigoo.

417
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,367
You boasting that you'll get your old house back was such a lie.

418
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:33,367
If you go work under someone, when would you get our house back?

419
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:37,230
You can't get satisfied with just one try. Please wait a little more, President Bang.

420
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,018
Aigoo aigoo.

421
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:43,366
Seems like someone came.

422
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,115
Is it Joo Ri?

423
00:29:47,074 --> 00:29:48,970
Joo Ri?

424
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:59,911
This lady, what brings you here again?

425
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:02,710
This... This trash is yours, right?

426
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:10,718
It's not like it has a name on it. How do you know if it's ours?

427
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:12,075
Ahjumma,

428
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:14,948
Your name is Bang Young Ja, right?

429
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:17,466
How do you know my name?

430
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,686
Inside the trash bag,

431
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,338
the moving company's contract was discovered.

432
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,591
So, don't think about denying.

433
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:29,615
Why is that in there?

434
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:33,722
You came?

435
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:36,084
Oh. You were here too.

436
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,708
Since this is your first time I'll let it slide, but

437
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:42,580
if there's more food trash or any regular trash,

438
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,047
I'll report to the organization and get 10 dollars from you each time.

439
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:47,912
Be careful from now on.

440
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,851
Yes! Yes, we'll be careful.

441
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:55,084
Aigoo, seriously. Hey, hey!

442
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:58,548
Here, 10 dollars! Use it to eat and leave.

443
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:01,802
What a rude and ill-mannered wench you are!

444
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:04,035
What? Rude and ill-mannered wench?

445
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:06,484
-Right!<br>-You... You don't see...!

446
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:07,759
Aigoo! Aigoo!

447
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,846
Aiyoo!

448
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:12,342
-Let go of me! <br>- Please stop!

449
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:13,476
Hey! Seriously!

450
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,890
Don't fight.

451
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,006
Don't interrupt! Hey!

452
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:21,088
Hey! I'm...

453
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:24,000
Why is this person like this?! Aiyoo!

454
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:27,439
You've worked hard.

455
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:33,501
Here...a sweet Popsicle.

456
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:34,600
Here...

457
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,900
Eat this, it's refreshing.

458
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:41,204
Relax my President Bang Young Ja.

459
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:48,784
Why?

460
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,886
Is it too cold to your teeth?

461
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:53,214
What should I do?

462
00:31:53,214 --> 00:31:56,432
Should I heat it up a little to melt and feed you?

463
00:31:56,432 --> 00:31:58,245
No.

464
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,527
Since we already moved,

465
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:10,087
you should try to get along with the neighbors

466
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:13,322
You fight all the time like a fighting rooster.

467
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,920
What will we do, Mom?

468
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,463
I just...

469
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:19,439
get angry.

470
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:23,662
Moving to this kind of neighborhood makes me angry.

471
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:28,843
Talking to those women makes me angry also.

472
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:32,600
Joo Ri who acted rashly to make noodles

473
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:37,047
which put us in this position...that makes me angry.

474
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:40,652
I'm burning up inside with anger.

475
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:47,559
I understand your feelings very well Mom.

476
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:50,063
But what can we do?

477
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:53,072
We have to accept this.

478
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,343
In my head I understand but

479
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,090
not in my heart

480
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:06,119
How did Geum Ryong Food's Ban Young Ja Chairman

481
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,494
become this inconsequential person?

482
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,322
I still feel as if I'm dreaming.

483
00:33:14,322 --> 00:33:18,409
It doesn't feel like reality.

484
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:27,295
I'm sorry, Mom.

485
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:29,706
It's because I'm useless.

486
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:34,214
I want to go to our house.

487
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,483
I don't like mixing with low quality people like that in this kind of neighborhood.

488
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,511
I want to go home.

489
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:44,015
Mom, just a little more,

490
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:46,369
Lets endure it a little more.

491
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,791
Mom, don't cry.

492
00:34:01,112 --> 00:34:02,647
Why the raw egg?

493
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:05,177
He has an event tomorrow so we're caring for his voice.

494
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,205
Hyung-nim do you want one ?

495
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:09,340
I'm fine.

496
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:13,160
But Oppa,

497
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,279
Umh. (Yea)

498
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:15,525
Pay more attention. Pay more attention to Unnie.

499
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,533
It's because I can't just stand by and watch.

500
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,041
What do you mean by that?

501
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,187
No more how i look at it,

502
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:28,781
it seems like Unni is cheating with the President.

503
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:31,862
They are each other's first loves.

504
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,945
Then,

505
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,468
You mean that guy who looks sleek like an In Jeol Mi (a kind of rice cake) brushed with sesame oil,

506
00:34:36,468 --> 00:34:38,125
that's your agency's president?

507
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,447
It seems like you've met our President.

508
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,009
I did see him from far away once,

509
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:44,687
and he looked like a total gangster.

510
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:46,965
What do you mean a gangster?

511
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:49,113
He's totally pure!

512
00:34:49,113 --> 00:34:52,810
He's got a humanity you can't find in this industry.

513
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:56,435
He looked like he loves to brag about his wealth...

514
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:59,792
he's just posturing, right? It's always the empty cart that's the loudest.

515
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,802
What empty cart...

516
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:03,798
Every song he releases hits it big

517
00:35:03,798 --> 00:35:06,242
so he's famed to have the hand of music industry's Midas.

518
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:08,409
His private mansion is also

519
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:11,337
on highest point in Gang Nam (equivalent to Beverly Hills or Park Ave).

520

<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Inheritance Team@Viki</i>

521
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:35,611
What are thinking about so hard?

522
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,180
Just this and that,

523
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,433
and Father.

524
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:42,701
You really

525
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:45,238
are a good woman

526
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,780
Honestly,

527
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,439
When her ex-husband's father passes away

528
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,065
how many women would actually work so hard to help out

529
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,182
and share the heartache?

530
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:57,609
You're sounding mature for once.

531
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:00,135
During this time

532
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:03,076
you have done all you could so

533
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:05,728
I'll comfortably let you go.

534
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:08,180
You can go when you please.

535
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,319
Wh-

536
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:12,199
What do you mean by that?

537
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,395
If it were up to me, I would like to re-register our marriage

538
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,488
and live with you

539
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:18,196
But unlike someone

540
00:36:18,196 --> 00:36:19,944
I don't have a lot of money.

541
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,906
nor do I have the capacity to succeed.

542
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,672
It's just my greed.

543
00:36:23,672 --> 00:36:24,958
Lik-

544
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,942
Like who?

545
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,912
Is there something you know about me?

546
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:35,705
You-

547
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:38,216
Is there something your hiding from me?

548
00:36:38,216 --> 00:36:40,246
No way!

549
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:43,436
Hiding? What could I be hiding?

550
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:45,275
If not, then never mind.

551
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:53,408
By the way, what was THAT?

552
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:55,094
What about?

553
00:36:55,094 --> 00:36:56,907
I mean, if you are being broadcasted,

554
00:36:56,907 --> 00:36:58,079
you should do some self promotion and

555
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,551
sing the song wonderfully...from the beginning to the end all you did was cry like a baby the whole time.

556
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,057
It was because I was so moved.

557
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:12,490
It was my first broadcasting in 10 years. When I think about all the hardship I faced,

558
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,724
how could I not be filled with emotion?

559
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:16,082
Like I'm saying,

560
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:18,866
what good is filling your heart with emotion?

561
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:21,469
when you bombed the broadcasting.

562
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:23,079
Despite that uncle-in-law's video is

563
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,147
a main topic on-line.

564
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:26,602
His video is getting a lot of hit on YouTube too.

565
00:37:27,772 --> 00:37:30,301
What do you mean by that Seul Hong?

566
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:38,665
Yes, it's Ddul Uh's Gang Jin.

567
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:41,791
Yes, President.

568
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:43,954
Huh?

569
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,111
You scheduled me for another radio broadcast?

570
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:48,505
Another radio broadcast?

571
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:49,959
Uh, uh. Yes.

572
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:52,857
Yes, which date?

573
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:06,305
All of my uncles will help me.

574
00:38:06,305 --> 00:38:08,700
We'll all do our best so

575
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:12,881
Don't worry.

576
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:16,504
Rest peacefully Grandfather.

577
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:29,493
I have a request.

578
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:33,648
The fact that I'm here,

579
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:36,525
keep it a secret for the time being.

580
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,443
Because you insisted til the end,

581
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:40,190
I might be going back alone today,

582
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,333
but that doesn't mean I've given up on you, Choon Hee.

583
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,629
Hyo Dong.

584
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:46,774
I'll be coming tomorrow and the day after and everyday after that to look for you.

585
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:49,458
Where do you think Paju is that you can come looking for me everyday.

586
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:52,324
It's my choice so don't worry about it.

587
00:38:52,324 --> 00:38:54,385
Hyo Dong.

588
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:59,396
Be careful on your way.

589
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:01,208
Also,

590
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,885
Don't come again.

591
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:05,665
It's my choice!

592
00:39:57,289 --> 00:39:58,502
So what you're saying is

593
00:39:58,502 --> 00:40:01,841
you're selling all of this to me?

594
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:03,718
I don't want to

595
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:06,812
ask you for this favor but

596
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:11,142
If I were to catch the bastard who skipped town with my money, I have to pay

597
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,086
retainer to the detective agency.

598
00:40:13,086 --> 00:40:14,248
Are you saying

599
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:16,808
that you don't have enough money to pay the detective agency

600
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:19,349
so you would like to sell the purses and jewels

601
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:21,420
is that what you are saying?

602
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:28,165
Oh my world, Oh my world.

603
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:32,284
Geum Ryong Food Bang Young Ja Chairman is selling purses and jewels

604
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:35,525
because she has no money?

605
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:41,313
I guess you just can't tell what tomorrow brings.

606
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,725
Ahhhh! Nevermind that!

607
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:46,717
Will you buy it or not?

608
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:54,068
What is this?

609
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:57,945
It's not a big amount but use it as a spending money.

610
00:40:57,945 --> 00:40:58,794
What?

611
00:40:58,794 --> 00:41:01,186
No matter how much I think about it, there's no one around me

612
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:05,187
who would buy a used luxury goods...

613
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:13,146
Is your pride hurt?

614
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:24,899
What's there to hurt my pride?

615
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,121
Aiyoo, cham.

616
00:41:27,956 --> 00:41:31,149
Not knowing that I've been had with a fraudulent marriage

617
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:35,312
If I had sued you I would have gotten a big settlement.

618
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:38,321
Aigoo this person

619
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:39,729
has a conscience.

620
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:41,053
I'll use it well.

621
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:43,196
Conscience? Chairman

622
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:44,633
I agree.

623
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:47,460
But,

624
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,766
have you stayed in contact with your old Daughter-in-law, President?

625
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:54,390
old Daughter-in-law? Who?

626
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,097
What do you mean who,

627
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,757
Tae San Group's youngest daughter...

628
00:41:57,757 --> 00:41:59,747
That's enough.

629
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:02,988
Ai...tasteless...why bring out the story of that thing?

630
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:06,070
A while ago I went to Paris.

631
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:10,014
By chance I saw someone that looks like your former daughter in law.

632
00:42:10,014 --> 00:42:11,587
Her stomach was...

633
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:13,719
Since we're done talking leave now.

634
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:14,946
Just listen to what I'm telling you.

635
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:18,676
You're so annoying!<br> -Her stomach...

636
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:19,356
Aren't you leaving?!

637
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:20,823
Go!<br>No, I mean, Chairman.<br>Go!

638
00:42:20,823 --> 00:42:21,712
Go!<br>No what I mean is...

639
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:23,427
If you're done with your business so it's all good. <br>No, I mean her belly was...

640
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:25,219
Listen to what I'm saying President.

641
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:28,000
Aigoo! Get out now!<br> President just listen to what I have to say.

642
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,779
So, I can start working from today on right?

643
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:42,217
Yes, of course.

644
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:44,622
Download the substitute driver app on your mobile phone

645
00:42:44,622 --> 00:42:47,280
and don't forget to deposit gas-refill money into the virtual account.

646
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,838
Ah yes, Of course.

647
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:51,799
But, President

648
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,623
When one takes the substitute driver's job,

649
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:59,249
what's the approximate income?

650
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:01,962
If you have many calls then about 100,000 Won a day.

651
00:43:01,962 --> 00:43:04,036
A beginner may even make about 5,000 Won.

652
00:43:04,905 --> 00:43:06,691
100,000 Won...

653
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:08,218
5,000 Won you say?

654
00:43:16,545 --> 00:43:19,683
Gim Cheol Gyu style is cramped quite a lot.

655
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,546
I have to do this kind of work just to earn 100,000 Won or 5,000 Won.

656
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,474
<i> Cheol Gyoo </i>

657
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,659
You have a strong side.

658
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:33,125
You can surmount this.

659
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:34,817
That's right,

660
00:43:34,817 --> 00:43:37,980
since my Chae Won Cheered me on, I should do my best.

661
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,457
It's just temporary until I get a regular employment anyway.

662
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,151
Yes, is that the call center?

663
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,764
This is Gim Cheol Gyu substitute driver who started today.

664
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:04,061
<i>The telephone of this client is turned off. The message will go to the voice mail after this announcement.</i>

665
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:07,443
<i>There will be a call charge after the voice mail starts.</i>

666
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:13,335
Mom, It's me.

667
00:44:15,459 --> 00:44:18,553
I'm departing on the evening flight, tonight.

668
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,466
I wanted to see you once more before I left.

669
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:29,420
Please contact me.

670
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:32,593
This time when I leave for America,

671
00:44:32,593 --> 00:44:35,280
I don't have any thoughts of coming back soon.

672
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:40,564
So, make sure to contact me.

673
00:44:45,506 --> 00:44:47,765
He is going on a plane today?

674
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,422
A guest came.

675
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,464
Guest?

676
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:15,591
The light has been flickering for a while and though I meant to change it I kept forgetting to do it.

677
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:18,547
But your husband is taking care of it all.

678
00:45:19,908 --> 00:45:22,061
Why did you come here again?

679
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:23,603
I already told you,

680
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:25,691
That I'll be coming everyday.

681
00:45:25,907 --> 00:45:28,031
I'm off to make a delivery.

682
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,175
Work hard.

683
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:31,732
Yes. Go on and back.

684
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,170
I...

685
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,516
have a question.

686
00:45:41,735 --> 00:45:44,869
I heard that Se Yoon is being transferred to the American branch,

687
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:48,603
does that mean that Chae Won is leaving too?

688
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:51,449
No.

689
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,154
No?

690
00:45:53,154 --> 00:45:56,190
I was afraid that you'd feel dissapointed, so I didn't say anything.

691
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,287
Se Yoon is asking to leave together

692
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:02,283
but I guess Chae Won isn't budging.

693
00:46:02,837 --> 00:46:06,032
Se Yoon's father's objection is strong too.

694
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:28,711
Choon Hee, It's me.

695
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:31,303
I don't think you should be acting like this.

696
00:46:31,608 --> 00:46:33,124
Se Yoon,

697
00:46:33,141 --> 00:46:35,132
is being transferred to the American branch.

698
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,014
I try to stop him but

699
00:46:38,014 --> 00:46:40,169
your brother-in-law is holding fast.

700
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:41,480
Also Se Yoon...

701
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,709
Then you should also let Chae Won go with him. Why are you letting him leave alone?

702
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:47,771
That...

703
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:51,444
Se Yoon and Chae Won broke up...

704
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,805
it's on that condition that he's going to the States,

705
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:55,644
Then what am I?

706
00:46:55,644 --> 00:46:58,647
I divorced my husband so that Chae Won and Se Yoon could get together,

707
00:46:58,647 --> 00:46:59,987
Just what is this?

708
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:01,564
Where are you?

709
00:47:01,564 --> 00:47:03,439
First lets meet and talk.

710
00:47:03,439 --> 00:47:05,291
There's no need to meet.

711
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:07,248
Se Yoon is leaving today,

712
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:09,414
Chae Won has to go with him.

713
00:47:09,414 --> 00:47:10,543
Choon Hee..

714
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:12,803
Call Brother-in-law.

715
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,033
Tell him, that if he doesn't do as I say...

716
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:19,474
I'll be reclaiming Se Yoon as my son.

717
00:47:19,482 --> 00:47:22,082
That is what brother-in-law fears the most.

718
00:47:22,082 --> 00:47:23,272
Choon Hee.

719
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:25,169
<i> Don't make me say it again. </i>

720
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:28,250
Chae Won and Se Yoon must leave for the States together today.

721
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,260
If not, I may turn really crazy!

722
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,901
Was that Choon Hee?

723
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:53,983
Choon Hee said that,

724
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:58,336
if Chae Won and Se Yoon don't go to the States together,

725
00:47:58,903 --> 00:48:00,968
She will...

726
00:48:01,263 --> 00:48:03,216
Reclaim Se Yoon.

727
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:05,587
Is she threatening us right now?

728
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:07,939
Choon Hee got a divorce for the sake of the kids,

729
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:11,261
However, Se Yoon and Chae Won is

730
00:48:11,273 --> 00:48:13,190
about to be ripped apart from each other

731
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,381
do you think she'll stay mum, knowing that?

732
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:20,896
I,

733
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:24,522
agree with Choon Hee.

734
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,392
you,

735
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:36,576
If you oppose until the end,

736
00:48:38,557 --> 00:48:41,577
I will go to the police office,

737
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:45,316
and set straight,

738
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:48,330
what I did 30 years ago.

739
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:52,371
Then I'm sure it will become a sensational special story on mass media and

740
00:48:52,822 --> 00:48:56,732
to a person like you who puts honor and pride before all else

741
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,417
and that will be fatal to you.

742
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,929
This person!

743
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:03,070
So please,

744
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:07,700
Honey, let's both end it right here.

745
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:23,600
<i> Subtitles brought by The Inheritance Team @ Viki</i>

746
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,645
Mom, please drink this.

747
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:36,526
Please get up Miss Kim KKeut Soon.

748
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:40,547
What is that?

749
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,806
Gang seo bang picked up a herbal medicine prescription.

750
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:46,947
Kang son-in-law?

751
00:49:46,947 --> 00:49:50,203
Yes. I had it made from a renown medicine center so it should be quite effective.

752
00:49:50,227 --> 00:49:52,863
Drink it all up then shake it off and recover, mother-in-law.

753
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,725
Are you guys in the right state of mind or not?

754
00:49:55,768 --> 00:50:01,357
How can I bury your father in a cold ground and audaciously take the herbal medicine?

755
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,454
Gosh, Mother-in-law

756
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:06,707
how is father-in-law in a cold ground?

757
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:09,598
He's probably settled in the best seat in heaven

758
00:50:09,598 --> 00:50:12,215
and in the midst of cranking out noodles.

759
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:17,934
Wow, since the noodle is being produced by our company's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation presidents

760
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,784
I bet the taste must be unbelievable.

761
00:50:22,065 --> 00:50:24,071
Just for the sake of Gang seo bang's effort

762
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:26,257
drink up, mom.

763
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:29,160
Aye, common mother-in-law.

764
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,658
Here you go, mom.

765
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,052
Aigoo.

766
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,612
Way to drink it, my mom.

767
00:50:42,071 --> 00:50:43,870
Here's a candy Mother-in-law.

768
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,438
Aigoo.

769
00:50:58,378 --> 00:51:00,705
Yes, Oppa.

770
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:02,877
Do you have time today?

771
00:51:02,877 --> 00:51:03,954
Why, Oppa?

772
00:51:03,954 --> 00:51:06,817
Today is a very important day for me,

773
00:51:07,508 --> 00:51:09,657
I would really like it if you could be with me.

774
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:10,740
Are you busy?

775
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,171
No, I'm not that busy.

776
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:15,061
Then meet in a hour at,

777
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,440
The Cafe we were at last time.

778
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,370
Ok,

779
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:21,178
I'll be at the Cafe we met at last time in a hour.

780
00:51:24,734 --> 00:51:27,915
If it's the best event of his life then

781
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:31,653
I guess he's about to formally propose to me?

782
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,830
<i>Also, since you've done as much as you should,</i>

783
00:51:43,377 --> 00:51:45,667
<i>I'll let you go without a fuss.</i>

784
00:51:46,057 --> 00:51:48,015
<i>Do what your heart dictates.</i>

785
00:51:49,629 --> 00:51:52,477
It feels like Bo Reum's daddy is also

786
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:55,006
becoming enlightened as of late.

787
00:51:58,703 --> 00:52:00,440
You scared me.

788
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,989
Why are you so jumpy?

789
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,186
Are you hiding something?

790
00:52:08,224 --> 00:52:10,454
Hiding? Hiding what?

791
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:15,198
I'm going to go out for a bit.

792
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,672
Where?

793
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,180
I'm going to go see some friends.

794
00:52:22,134 --> 00:52:24,689
Ok, I understand.

795
00:52:25,303 --> 00:52:27,019
Honey,

796
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,132
Uh, that

797
00:52:30,132 --> 00:52:33,358
orange color dress, you know?

798
00:52:33,379 --> 00:52:35,700
That seems to suit you the best.

799
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,451
Wear that when you go out.

800
00:52:46,605 --> 00:52:51,213
Does he know something or not?

801
00:53:05,646 --> 00:53:08,922
That Oppa is singing again.

802
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:29,894
<i>It really looks like he is going to propose to me.</i>

803
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,174
<i>What should I do?</i>

804
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:34,071
<i>I'll ask him to give me some time for now.</i>

805
00:53:34,095 --> 00:53:36,791
<i>I need to listen to Bo Reum's opinion.</i>

806
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:40,819
<i>Now that I am thinking of parting, I'm feeling sentimental.</i>

807
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:43,454
<i>He has a good personality and is well mannered.</i>

808
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:47,781
<i>Actually, there are not that many men around like Bo Reum's dad.</i>

809
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,517
How did you like my song?

810
00:53:58,545 --> 00:54:00,010
It's always nice.

811
00:54:00,258 --> 00:54:01,885
Really?

812
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,195
<i>Oppa!</i>

813
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:22,664
<i>Over here.</i>

814
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:30,602
Who is she?

815
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,690
I told you on the phone earlier.

816
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,151
I said the biggest event of my life will happen today.

817
00:54:36,938 --> 00:54:39,197
She's my girlfriend. I'll propose to her today.

818
00:54:40,348 --> 00:54:43,743
With the ring you picked out earlier, I'll propose to her.

819
00:54:49,259 --> 00:54:51,040
<i>Ah, why don't you say hello?</i>

820
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,031
She's my first love from high school, MS. Gong Kang Sook.

821
00:54:55,031 --> 00:54:56,990
I've heard a lot about you, Unni.

822
00:54:57,647 --> 00:54:59,474
Yes...

823
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:03,519
Over here, she is my first love when I was in my 30's, Kim Ma Ri.

824
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:07,925
I happened to meet her again recently.

825
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:12,245
Seriously, how many first loves do you have?

826
00:55:12,404 --> 00:55:13,700
I didn't tell you?

827
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,955
That all love is first love.

828
00:55:16,982 --> 00:55:19,301
So...

829
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:23,032
You were going to propose to your first love from your 30's...

830
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:25,788
That's why you took me to look at the rings.

831
00:55:25,813 --> 00:55:31,301
You sang in front of me to practice. Is that what happened?

832
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:33,066
Thanks, Kang Sook.

833
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:35,424
You helped a lot.

834
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:40,276
What kind of jerk are you?!

835
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:44,729
Did you just play around with my wife?!

836
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:53,032
Bo Reum's dad!

837
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:04,211
Are you leaving already?

838
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:07,585
Yes. I'm supposed to meet Hyung Seuk Joo at the airport.

839
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:10,023
You have a lot of time.

840
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:12,040
You should have dinner before you go.

841
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,314
I can eat something at the airport.

842
00:56:18,423 --> 00:56:21,455
I... will just get going.

843
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:23,429
Ah... wait a minute, Se Yoon.

844
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:26,245
I'll be right back after I get changed.<br>Let's go together.

845
00:56:26,245 --> 00:56:28,406
I called for a taxi.

846
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:31,404
When I get to the airport,

847
00:56:31,423 --> 00:56:32,867
I'll give you a call.

848
00:56:33,626 --> 00:56:37,140
Are you really going to send away Se Yoon like this?

849
00:56:37,158 --> 00:56:40,947
Be healthy and come back safely.

850
00:56:48,053 --> 00:56:49,913
I...

851
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:51,947
will get going.

852
00:57:03,972 --> 00:57:06,426
Don't worry about me.

853
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:08,438
Spend time well with Father.

854
00:57:09,419 --> 00:57:11,680
And take care of your health.

855
00:57:39,315 --> 00:57:40,468
Please take me to Incheon International Airport.

856
00:57:40,468 --> 00:57:42,035
Ok, Customer.

857
00:57:51,621 --> 00:57:52,819
Hello.

858
00:57:52,864 --> 00:57:55,436
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

859
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,247
I'm heading to the airport.

860
00:57:58,285 --> 00:57:59,975
<i>Before you leave,</i>

861
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:03,506
<i>shouldn't you visit your mom?</i>

862
00:58:04,027 --> 00:58:06,535
Where is Mom?!

863
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,352
Ok, ok.

864
00:58:11,787 --> 00:58:13,544
I understand.

865
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:17,730
Driver, I'm sorry, but

866
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:19,529
please take me to Chun Ahn.

867
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:22,054
Didn't you tell me you had a flight to catch?

868
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:24,309
It's a 940 PM flight.

869
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:26,634
If we can go there quickly, I think it will be alright.

870
00:58:26,855 --> 00:58:30,399
All the way to Chun Ahn, we are tight on time.

871
00:58:31,168 --> 00:58:34,481
I'll pay you well for the service, so please try.

872
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:38,217
Then, let's take a shortcut.

873
00:58:48,189 --> 00:58:49,865
You don't have much time.

874
00:58:49,865 --> 00:58:53,525
Pack up immediately and go to the airport.

875
00:58:53,525 --> 00:58:54,437
Mother!

876
00:58:54,437 --> 00:58:56,917
Chae Won, this is your last chance.

877
00:58:57,373 --> 00:58:58,267
Still...

878
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:00,435
Leave everything else to me.

879
00:59:00,435 --> 00:59:02,342
I'll take care of everything.

880
00:59:02,366 --> 00:59:06,344
So, you just close your eyes and leave quickly.

881
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,203
Hurry!

882
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:24,969
Driver, could you speed up a little bit?

883
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:27,927
I'm already driving fast.

884
00:59:27,948 --> 00:59:31,539
I think we're going to be a bit tight with time for my flight.

885
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:42,259
<i>This is your last chance, Chae Won.</i>

886
00:59:55,157 --> 00:59:57,649
We are almost there.

887
00:59:57,986 --> 00:59:59,815
Okay, Driver.

888
01:00:39,522 --> 01:00:40,866
The pt was involved in a motor vehicle accident.

889
01:00:40,866 --> 01:00:44,248
He's unconscious, and sustained severe trauma to his head and chest.

890
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:45,991
Call and tell the neurology service to come quickly.

891
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:47,225
And notify the patient's guardian.

892
01:00:47,225 --> 01:00:48,427
Okay.

893
01:01:02,997 --> 01:01:04,678
Defibrillate, hurry!

894
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:19,639
-Defibrillator!<br>-Ok, Doctor.

895
01:01:24,871 --> 01:01:26,356
Shock!

896
01:01:29,346 --> 01:01:30,771
Shock!

897
01:01:36,937 --> 01:01:38,915
It's me, Se Yoon.

898
01:01:39,214 --> 01:01:41,766
I can't get in touch with you.

899
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:45,303
I... am at the airport right now.

900
01:01:45,808 --> 01:01:48,208
Give me a call as soon as you get this message.

901
01:01:48,387 --> 01:01:49,976
<i>Shock.</i>

902
01:01:53,266 --> 01:01:54,841
Shock.
