1
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:04,346
Max, Caroline, I have announcement.

2
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:07,141
You're actually much shorter
and are walking on stilts?

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,623
I have made a special menu

4
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:11,728
for tomorrow's
Valentine's night dinner.

5
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:13,939
Han, that's so romantic.

6
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:15,813
Yeah, romantic and wrong.

7
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:17,398
<i>This place isn't
When Harry met Sally.</i>

8
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:20,301
It's "When Harry met Salmonella."

9
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:22,803
Max, Club Sandwich.

10
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:25,159
And heads up... I lost a band-aid.

11
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:29,496
Theme menu means
I can charge one bigger price,

12
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,497
like in top restaurants.

13
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,875
See?
"Prick fix."

14
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,585
Oh, Han, it's pronounced "prix fixe."

15
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:35,983
Have you seen our chef?

16
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:38,547
It's definitely "prick fix."

17
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:39,921
Tomorrow night,

18
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:42,843
Cupid will come
to Williamsburg diner.

19
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,849
Didn't have the heart
to tell him Cupid is dead.

20
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,382
Yep, hit by a mack truck

21
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:53,968
crossing
the Brooklyn-Queens expressway...

22
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:56,020
His fat, diapered baby ass

23
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:58,395
splattered all over the windshield.

24
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,776
I love Valentine's Day.

25
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:03,822
That's your reaction?
I killed Cupid.

26
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:05,574
You're either romantic or not.

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,431
I'm not even going to try
to convince you.

28
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:09,244
Oh, he's dead.
And the proof...

29
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,685
When's the last time you knew
anyone who fell in love?

30
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,166
<i>Real love, like Ice Loves Coco.</i>

31
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:15,751
How about them?

32
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,961
They've been holding hands and
romantic whispering all night.

33
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:20,745
Their romantic whispering
goes like this.

34
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,470
"I own nipple clamps."

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,168
Plink!
Cupid's not dead.

36
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:28,972
Plink!
There goes his little arrow.

37
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:30,538
Plink, plink!

38
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:33,224
Clamp, ouch!
Clamp, ouch!

39
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:35,395
Clamp, clamp!
Ouch, ouch!

40
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:52,670
{pub}Max, since it's just after midnight,

41
00:01:57,257 --> 00:01:59,837
Well, judging from
that smile on your face,

42
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:02,304
I'd say it's a finger-sized hole
in your apron.

43
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,595
Candy hearts!
Here, hold out your hand.

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,353
Let's get our heart on.

45
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:12,231
I'm way ahead of you.

46
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,195
"Be mine"... classic.
What's yours say?

47
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:21,091
"Caroline Channing is lame.

48
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:23,727
"I hate you for giving me this.

49
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,197
Valentine's Day is the worst."

50
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:27,822
Ooh, cinnamon.
Mmm.

51
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,920
Good evening, Earl.

52
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:36,907
My, my, my, Sophie,

53
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,493
seeing you in that dress
makes my heart race.

54
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,761
Two scoops of ice cream
in a one scoop cone.

55
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:46,550
Oh, Earl, you make me smile.

56
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:50,853
I wish we had black people in
Poland when I was growing up.

57
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,956
Too bad.

58
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:57,484
We really would have enjoyed
segregation and Hitler.

59
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,608
Oh, hi, building neighbors.

60
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:04,325
Well, I was just driving by,
and since it was raining,

61
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:06,136
I thought I could offer you two girls

62
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:08,120
a ride home in my town car.

63
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:10,191
The last time
someone offered me a ride,

64
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:13,444
I ended up in
a drainage pipe in Jersey.

65
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,085
Sophia, you rent a town car?

66
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,698
Yes, but only when it's raining,

67
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,368
because, you know, I got hair
extensions and nail extensions,

68
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,054
and, you know, I...
I'm too extended to walk.

69
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:31,285
Hello.
I saw you from kitchen.

70
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,605
You turned pick-up window
into painting.

71
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,315
Plink!

72
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:39,155
Velvet painting of nude at counter.

73
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:42,821
Clamp, ouch!

74
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:47,952
The girls tell me
you own cleaning service.

75
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:50,371
I would like to hire you
to clean my house.

76
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:52,700
Oh, yeah, this is possible.

77
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:55,167
I will send girl.
What is your address?

78
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,820
I don't want some girl.

79
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,695
I want you to come clean.

80
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,661
Oh, you cannot get me to come.

81
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:10,623
Oh, I can get you to come.

82
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:17,064
No, I can no longer come anymore.

83
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:21,026
No, Max and Caroline can come.

84
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:23,292
No, no, we're not coming.

85
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:29,243
So no one can get you to come?

86
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:33,230
Well, some people
can get me to come...

87
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,500
Just not you.

88
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:40,281
Hard to get... I like it.

89
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,468
Go get the coats.
I'll get this check.

90
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,381
Here's the last check, Earl.

91
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:47,511
Oh, Max, can you take care
of that for me, please?

92
00:04:47,677 --> 00:04:48,637
Sure. Why?

93
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:50,958
Uh, nothing pressing...
Just having a heart attack.

94
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:51,849
I'll see you tomorrow.

95
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,976
Wait, you're having a heart attack?

96
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:55,596
Most definitely.

97
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,187
I've had three in my life.
We're old friends.

98
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:59,064
Earl, you're having a heart attack.

99
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,185
I'll be fine.
Have you seen my tangerine?

100
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,694
I had a tangerine set aside
for my walk home.

101
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,237
Forget the tangerine.

102
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:06,780
Earl's having a heart attack!

103
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:09,533
Sophie, we're taking
the town car to the hospital.

104
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,201
Earl, when did the pain start?

105
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:15,021
When I saw Sophie in that dress.

106
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,571
Oh, hell, no!

107
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,213
Why is this line so long?
Did the new iPhone come out?

108
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,775
Let's just get him over there.

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,967
Max, anything you can do
to move this along?

110
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,780
Move!
Celebrity coming through.

111
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:32,556
Morgan Freeman having a heart attack.

112
00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:35,017
He is having a heart attack.

113
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:37,561
On a scale of one to ten,
what's your pain?

114
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,590
Uh, two, we were
just in the neighborhood,

115
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,857
looking for a place to have jell-o.

116
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:44,693
I was talking to Morgan Freeman.

117
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,513
Take him now!

118
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,405
Sir, he has a history
of heart trouble.

119
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:50,032
All right, we'll get him in.

120
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:51,950
Earl, go with the nurse.

121
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,676
Damn, it's a man.

122
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,290
We'll be right out here, Earl.
Everything is gonna be okay.

123
00:05:58,456 --> 00:05:59,958
Have a seat and wait.

124
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:03,414
Look at me, Gingerbread.
If anything happens to him,

125
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,714
I will staple your nut sack
to that chair.

126
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,358
{pub}That's right... it's me again.

127
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:23,800
For the tenth time, he's fine.

128
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,586
He had a minor attack,
but he's in good hands.

129
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:29,589
I would know... I had both
of my heart attacks here.

130
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,785
I want to go back there
and see for myself.

131
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:33,329
Family members only.

132
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,039
Well, I'm his daughter.

133
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:39,168
Oh, really? It says here
he's 75 years old...

134
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:40,961
Well, he started late.

135
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,297
And African-American.

136
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:46,759
He started late with a honky.
I'm one of those combo babies.

137
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,510
Here...

138
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:50,243
You need proof?

139
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,380
My last name is Black, see?
Max Black.

140
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:55,632
He's black.
I'm Black.

141
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,519
It'd be dumb if we weren't related.

142
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,814
<i>Can I just get back
to playing Angry Birds?</i>

143
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,889
You are yammering on here
about nothing

144
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:05,444
while the love of my life
is back there alone and scared.

145
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,976
You said he was your father.

146
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,989
Now he's the love of your life?

147
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:12,493
He's both.
We're from the South.

148
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:13,994
Have a seat.

149
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,124
I got us two lattes.
It took forever.

150
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,524
The guy in front of me
missed his kidney transplant

151
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,476
waiting for a mocha frappuccino.

152
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:24,797
- Any news?
- The same.

153
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:27,800
But they won't let me back there.
I even told him Earl was my father.

154
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,501
Now's my chance.
Nurse Chewbacca's on the move.

155
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm going back there.

156
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:34,420
If you see anyone about
to notice me sneak by,

157
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:35,766
draw all the attention to yourself.

158
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:37,977
Max, I don't know if I can do that.

159
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:39,629
You're right.
That's kind of my thing.

160
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:41,872
- Okay, let me think.
- You don't have time to think.

161
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:43,273
Just throw the coffees
against the wall.

162
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,514
That's ridiculous.

163
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,132
I graduated top of my class
at Wharton.

164
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,194
I can do better than that.

165
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:51,907
<i>Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.</i>

166
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,159
Oh, my God!

167
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,624
Those were not nonfat.

168
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:08,716
Earl!

169
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:11,552
- You in here?
- Max, is that you?

170
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,078
Ain't you sweet?

171
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,989
But you didn't have
to wait around for me.

172
00:08:17,114 --> 00:08:18,998
This is Narcissus.

173
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,602
She's from the Fiji Islands

174
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,731
and gives one hell of a sponge bath.

175
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:26,455
Hi.
Can we have a minute alone?

176
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:28,925
Earl, do you think
this is a good time

177
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,071
to have a sponge bath...
I mean, in your condition?

178
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,929
Max, when they look like that,

179
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,743
there's never a bad time
for a sponge bath.

180
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,746
- So are you doing okay now?
- Pretty good.

181
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:40,687
The doctor said it was a mild one,

182
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,072
but I'm going to have
to stay here a couple nights.

183
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:45,919
Could you find out how much
extra for me to get my own room?

184
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,463
A private room?

185
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,162
The last time I was
in one of these places,

186
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,731
the guy in the bed next to me
thought he was a parrot

187
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:55,304
and asked me for crackers
the whole damn night.

188
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,069
Done. I'll get you your own room.

189
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:58,705
And don't worry about the expenses.

190
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,907
I got a little money
stashed away for a rainy day.

191
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:02,842
I am not using your money.

192
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:05,147
But let me guess,
"rainy day" is a strain of weed?

193
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,648
Now you're getting it.

194
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,612
I'll see you later.

195
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:13,655
Don't die, or I'll kill you.

196
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,957
So what, now you want a private room?

197
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:19,620
How's he going to pay for that?

198
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,528
Oh, so that old man has
to be the only man in America

199
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:24,333
who has to pay his medical bills?

200
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:28,378
Mr. Freeman's done
a lot of successful movies.

201
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:31,423
I don't think your sarcastic
attitude is very professional.

202
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:32,906
"Professional"?

203
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,942
Um, an hour ago,
your little thug friend here

204
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:39,473
threatened to cut me so deep,
I'd have a vagina.

205
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,144
That offer still stands.

206
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,565
She's upset.
And vagina's her go-to.

207
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:50,890
Well, the only reason
I haven't called security

208
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:53,112
is they were laid off two weeks ago.

209
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,488
What is your name?

210
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:55,962
Tig.

211
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:58,283
And it's fake,
so good luck with that.

212
00:09:58,449 --> 00:09:59,799
Sir, you're representing

213
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:01,995
the Shecter family wing
of this hospital.

214
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,020
My family knows the Schecters.

215
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,072
In fact, their son David
interns here,

216
00:10:06,197 --> 00:10:08,574
and if I made a call,
he would not be pleased.

217
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:09,809
If you know them,

218
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:12,779
why are we talking
to this lump behind a desk?

219
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,248
Suck it, red face!
We're going over your head!

220
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,844
How do you like me now, bitch?

221
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:20,389
Hey, get your phone.

222
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,372
See if he can swing Earl
a private room.

223
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,725
I think I still have his cell number.

224
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,092
We went out a few times
until I realized he was serious

225
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,896
about going down that pro Bono route.

226
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,929
- Did you two have sex?
- No.

227
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,706
Sweet, that's what you
can offer him for the room.

228
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:37,520
That's amazing.

229
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:40,242
Someone found a florist
that delivers after midnight.

230
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:41,474
That's not so amazing.

231
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,309
I know a guy
named "Sticky Icky" Ricky

232
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,373
who delivers
exclusively after midnight.

233
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:49,365
You know, I just realized
this is the first Valentine's Day

234
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,003
I won't get flowers from my father.

235
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:54,882
Aw, that's cute,
with a big old side of creepy.

236
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:56,456
No, it's sweet.

237
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,241
Every year
from the time I was a baby,

238
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,959
and even when I had boyfriends,

239
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,578
I'd get flowers from my father
with a card that says,

240
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,349
"You'll always be my Valentine."

241
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:07,417
I got a sweet Valentine from
a guy I liked in high school.

242
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,856
It said, "I'll give you
five bucks to lift your shirt."

243
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,402
Caroline...
Hey, I'll be right with you.

244
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:18,030
There he is.
Cuter than I remember.

245
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:21,848
Hey. Wow.

246
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,994
When I heard your voice mail,
I couldn't believe it.

247
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,152
Yes, well, I wasn't sure
you'd want to come down,

248
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:28,165
because...
you know...

249
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:30,167
You dumped me two years ago?

250
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,502
Well, "dumped" is a strong word.

251
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:35,321
Tore my heart out,
shook it in front of my face.

252
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:37,007
That any softer?

253
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,117
Hate to interrupt
the "perfect white teeth" convention,

254
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,401
but we're in a hurry.

255
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:43,805
David, this is my friend Max.

256
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,237
A friend of ours was admitted,

257
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:47,226
and we were hoping
to get him a private room.

258
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:48,841
Oh, so you're not here to return

259
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,479
my Dartmouth t-shirt
you stole from me.

260
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:51,844
You gave that to me.

261
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,482
No, I didn't!
I love that shirt.

262
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:56,349
I feel like I lost custody
of it in a divorce,

263
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:58,445
and now I'm like a deadbeat dad.

264
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,103
How about the room?
Any chance?

265
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:01,406
Please.
Pretty please.

266
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:03,056
Oh, well, since
you said "pretty please,"

267
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,159
I'll see what I can do.

268
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,943
We should be clear.
We can't pay.

269
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,112
We're broke...
both of us.

270
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:10,791
But I'm sure
you heard that somewhere.

271
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:11,814
Yeah...

272
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,876
Everywhere.

273
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:16,235
David, I hope your family
didn't lose any money

274
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,297
with my father.
Did they?

275
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:19,174
Nope, still filthy rich.

276
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,825
And I can do my best to burn
some filthy off that rich,

277
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,179
by getting your friend a V.I.P. room.

278
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,431
I'll just drop some names.

279
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:28,414
By that, I mean my own.

280
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,685
Shouldn't be a problem.

281
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,993
I love Jews.

282
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,873
Yeah, we're generous.
Spread the word.

283
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:45,575
Uh, if you wouldn't mind
giving Narcissus my whereabouts?

284
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:48,601
Did you see the look on
that desk lump's big, red face

285
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,830
when I pushed you by him?

286
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:51,971
I did, but I think
throwing him the finger

287
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,710
was a tad out of line.

288
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,945
Wow, Dr. David really hooked us up.

289
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,982
<i>Yeah, this is like an episode
I.C.U. Edition.</i>

290
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:04,650
So, Earl, what do you think?

291
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,221
Good lord, is that a Matisse?

292
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:09,016
- I believe so.
- Then, mama, I'm home.

293
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:15,826
{pub}Here, ladies, put
these suckers in your station.

294
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:18,329
I think I might get
a late Valentine dinner crowd.

295
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,815
You also think you might
get a late growth spurt,

296
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,417
but that's not happening either.

297
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,170
At best,
you'll get three single girls

298
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,714
waddling over at midnight
to cry into some tapioca.

299
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,343
True.
I need to cut the crap.

300
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:32,961
Valentine's dinner is bust.

301
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:37,598
And look, I have sacrificed
my manhood for no cash value.

302
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:40,059
But your wings are adorable.

303
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:44,521
Yes, but matching panties
are suffocating the boys.

304
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:47,191
Come on, close early.

305
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:49,234
We've only got
one table of twi-hards.

306
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,569
I want to go see Earl.

307
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:53,231
Oh, what the hell?
I love my man Earl, too.

308
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,240
So screw it.
Let's fly over there.

309
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:02,657
Ooh, this isn't like
the hospitals in Poland.

310
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:05,126
The lights are working.

311
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:07,753
Okay, sit down.
I'll take you in one at a time.

312
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:11,205
All right, Cupid, you're first.

313
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,760
Oh, don't wake him.
Go back out.

314
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:18,722
Angels.
Oh, lord, no.

315
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,177
Thank God it's you, Han.

316
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:24,479
I saw the wings,
and I thought heaven was filled

317
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:29,149
with chunky Chinese cherubs
and no jazz.

318
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:32,569
Oh, okay, great.
I'll see you in five.

319
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:34,272
I'm gonna go meet Dr. David.

320
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,657
Oh, wait a second.

321
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,742
If you're going to go meet man,
you need lip gloss.

322
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:39,201
Oh, thanks, Sophie.

323
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,578
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Okay.

324
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:49,920
I have Valentine gift
I want to give you.

325
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:52,631
Oh, hepatitis "C"?

326
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:55,642
Happy Valentine's Day.

327
00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:01,233
Look at me.
Now look at you.

328
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:03,618
Now look at me again.

329
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:06,645
Does this look right to you?

330
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:10,727
Hard to get... I like it.

331
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,822
Oh, hey.
So how's your friend doing?

332
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:18,283
Good.
And thanks for that V.I.P. room.

333
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:20,985
He feels like a million bucks,
which I'm sure is what it costs,

334
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,870
so I brought you
a little thank-you gift.

335
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:25,540
That is not my Dartmouth shirt.

336
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,332
No, that's held hostage
at the townhouse.

337
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:29,460
This says Williamsburg.
That's where I live now.

338
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:31,546
No way.
That's where I live.

339
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,164
Yeah, I moved there
just to piss my father off,

340
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,631
but I wound up loving it.

341
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:36,634
I wound up loving it, too.

342
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,003
Hey, maybe we could see
each other there sometime...

343
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:40,387
You know, go out?

344
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,222
Yeah, I don't think so.

345
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,134
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

346
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:48,429
Look, Caroline,
it's been really great

347
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:50,239
getting to reconnect with you, but...

348
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:52,316
I don't see this happening again.

349
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:53,942
Oh.

350
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,687
I mean, it's my parents.

351
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:58,090
With your father in prison,
the whole scandal,

352
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,073
I could never bring you home.

353
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,035
Not even just
to piss off your father?

354
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:05,971
I mean, me dating Caroline Channing...
What would people think?

355
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,811
I hope you understand.
Oh, hey, thanks for the tee.

356
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,621
Nice of everyone to stop by.

357
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:16,215
Didn't see Caroline.
She busy tonight?

358
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,842
Oh, no, she's here.

359
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,595
She's out there running around,
trying to swing a boyfriend situation

360
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,096
with her doctor friend
who got us the V.I.P. hook-up.

361
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,099
What about you, Max?

362
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:27,958
No sweetheart on Valentine's Day.

363
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,004
I worry about you.

364
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,231
Be nice if you had someone special.

365
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:34,274
I already do.

366
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,780
Ah, Max, I'm only going to be
around another 30 or 40 years.

367
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:40,489
You better widen the net a bit.

368
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:43,992
Visiting hours are up.
Friends have to leave.

369
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:45,619
She can stay, nurse.
She's family.

370
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,831
Earl, I'm family?

371
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:51,917
Yes, and the best kind of family.
You don't want my money.

372
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,797
Hey, Earl.
You look really good.

373
00:16:56,963 --> 00:17:01,035
So did you and Dr. Dave
do it in a hospital closet?

374
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,553
All very "Grey's Monotony"?

375
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,205
No, that won't be happening.

376
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,207
I asked him out and
he said he could never date me,

377
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:09,601
because of my father
and "what would people think?"

378
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,545
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

379
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,981
I feel like I was just hit

380
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,023
by the same mack truck
that killed Cupid.

381
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,602
Well, somebody's about
to get hit by a truck...

382
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:19,653
A Max truck.

383
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:25,893
Hey, you, Dr. I-Forget-Your-Name.

384
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:28,245
How?
It's written on every wall.

385
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:30,719
Okay, Dr. Exit.

386
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,787
What is wrong with you?
Doctors are supposed to be sensitive.

387
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:38,289
I mean, it's Valentine's Day,
and she has nothing.

388
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:40,174
Couldn't you be like
every other guy on the planet

389
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,176
and just lead her on
and not call her the next day?

390
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:45,095
That is the decent thing to do.

391
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:48,683
And for the record, she is
so hopped up on candy hearts,

392
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:51,425
you would have gotten some
tonight, fo' sho!

393
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:55,188
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

394
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:58,192
Well, I guess nobody knows me
better than you,

395
00:17:58,317 --> 00:17:59,776
girl I've never met before.

396
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,764
And now I would like to speak
to the pro Bono part of you,

397
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:05,283
who understands
that nothing I just said

398
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:07,235
should affect that man
in the V.I.P. room.

399
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,119
That was actually
a very cool thing to do.

400
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:10,771
Earl is fine.
Don't worry.

401
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:13,085
And as far as Caroline goes,
I'm sorry, but...

402
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,330
Her father hurt a lot of people.

403
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:17,586
Whatever you put out there
comes back to you.

404
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:23,545
Ugh.

405
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,765
What now... you gonna threaten
to feed me my nipples again?

406
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:32,094
No.

407
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:34,178
Actually, someone just said something

408
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,147
about the things
you do coming back to you,

409
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:39,107
and I decided the smart move
was to apologize.

410
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:42,001
Thanks, but it's not necessary.

411
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:45,906
Actually, you're the nicest
person I've dealt with tonight.

412
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:49,494
Ugh.
Rough job, dude.

413
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,913
Here, Happy Valentine's Day.

414
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:55,540
You want to go out sometime?

415
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:58,586
Why would...

416
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:01,296
Yeah, give me your number.
I'll call you tomorrow.

417
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:09,964
Sleeping in
that hospital chair all night

418
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,432
wasn't that uncomfortable.

419
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:12,633
No, the chairs weren't.

420
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:16,304
Your sad Valentine whimpering was.

421
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:19,022
- So how you feeling this morning?
- Pretty good,

422
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,559
considering I survived
the very first Valentine's Day

423
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,318
I didn't get flowers from my father.

424
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:25,313
Ugh.

425
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:27,231
So you got one year under your belt.

426
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:28,490
Don't get so cocky.

427
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:31,451
You still have
to make 23 more to tie me.

428
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:35,289
You know, all this time,
I've been feeling sorry for you

429
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:36,741
'cause you didn't know your father,

430
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:39,993
but after seeing
how you took care of Earl...

431
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,214
I feel sorry for your father
that he didn't know you.

432
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:45,590
You would have been
a wonderful daughter.

433
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:48,927
Don't hold that thought.

434
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:53,264
I don't want to cry till after
we break open the tapioca.

435
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:01,733
No, I didn't just win
a beauty contest.

436
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,385
No, these were left
on the front doorstep.

437
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,020
They're both addressed to Caroline.

438
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:08,222
- Sorry, Max.
- Oh, no, that's cool.

439
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:10,866
Wouldn't want to break
my winning streak.

440
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:13,561
Oh, well, just look at it this way.

441
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:16,747
She got the flowers.
You got the knockers.

442
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,292
All right, girls,

443
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,003
well, I'm off to buy scratchers

444
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,422
before all
the Puerto Ricans get them.

445
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,994
"You'll always be my Valentine.

446
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:32,046
Love, Daddy."

447
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:33,080
Aw.

448
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:34,799
The other one from Dr. Dave?

449
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:37,350
Change his mind
after I tore him a new one?

450
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:40,145
It's from my father as well,
but it's written to you.

451
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:45,359
"Thank you for taking such
good care of my sweetheart.

452
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:46,562
M. Channing."

453
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:48,820
That is so sweet.

454
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,752
Roses from a man.

455
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,019
Now I'm starting to get it.

456
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:56,870
Is it weird that I kind of want
to have sex with your dad?

457
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:01,917
Plink!
