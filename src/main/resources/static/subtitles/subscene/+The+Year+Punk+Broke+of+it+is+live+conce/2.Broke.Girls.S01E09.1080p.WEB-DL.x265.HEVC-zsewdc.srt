1
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:03,881
Max.

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:07,260
It's the woman at table 2's 50th birthday
and her husband wants us to sing to her.

3
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:10,232
If I had a dollar every time a man
asked me to do something to his wife,

4
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:11,392
I'd be a millionaire.

5
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,459
I remember when
Happy Birthday first came up.

6
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:18,967
I never thought it would catch on.

7
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,011
Go!

8
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:22,441
And smile.

9
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:23,907
When you fake smile,

10
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:25,852
everybody else fakes smile back.

11
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:30,494
Nobody wants to hear that lame song.

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,554
If we want to humiliate her in public, why
don't we go over there and pull her top down?

13
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,730
Come on, let's just go sing
and make the best of it.

14
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,469
Ready?

15
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:42,117
One, two, three...

16
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:48,185
♪ Happy birthday to you...♪

17
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:50,016
Whoa!

18
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,173
I apologize.

19
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:57,108
It's hard enough your husband took you
to a diner on your birthday

20
00:00:57,228 --> 00:00:58,901
and now you have to listen to white Mariah?

21
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:00,312
No!

22
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,462
Happy ***.

23
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:11,097
♪ To yoooooooou ♪

24
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:29,182
I have announcement to make.

25
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:32,069
I agree with what Max said before.

26
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,770
What? That we should tie
a little bell around you,

27
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:40,410
so we know when you're near?

28
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:42,129
The diner needs a fresh, new way

29
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:44,114
to celebrate the customer birthday.

30
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:47,384
So I just went
and wrote a special song.

31
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:49,786
Han, I'd be happy to look
at what you've written so far.

32
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:51,254
I took music theory in college.

33
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:53,340
I once wrote
an entire original musical

34
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:54,975
based on the French revolution.

35
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,460
Um, sorry to step on your nerd turf,

36
00:01:57,462 --> 00:02:00,564
<i>but Les Mis is already a musical
about the French revolution.</i>

37
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:03,900
Yes, but mine was from
the point of view of the rich.

38
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:06,019
What are you going
to rewrite next--

39
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:09,773
<i>the musical rent from the point
of view of the landlord?</i>

40
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:13,410
Han, this is
a lovely start, but--

41
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:17,364
But not good enough.

42
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:18,665
I know what you are saying.

43
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,650
"You need to practice more, Han.

44
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,753
"You never will be
as good as your sister, Han.

45
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:24,487
"Whole family going on vacation

46
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,506
without you
while you practice, Han."

47
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:28,625
Back off, tiger mom!

48
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:33,046
Hey, Caroline, is Max around?

49
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:36,199
Um, she might be.
I'll go check.

50
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:39,553
You'll never guess who
just came into the restaurant.

51
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:40,854
You'll be very happy.

52
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:43,607
<i>Gary, the fat guy from teen mom?</i>

53
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:45,859
Someone you like,
someone you want to kiss,

54
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,144
someone you're hot for.

55
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,896
<i>Tyler, the skinny guy from teen mom?</i>

56
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,232
What's Johnny doing here?

57
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,567
I told him not
to show his face unless--

58
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,235
Unless he broke up
with his girlfriend.

59
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,020
And now he's here, showing his face,

60
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:59,072
- which means--
- You can't know that for sure.

61
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:01,458
Fine. Tell me one other reason
he could possibly be in here.

62
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,827
He needs Han to solve
a complex math problem?

63
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,662
Max!

64
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:07,964
Max, it's pretty obvious
that he's in here

65
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,666
because he broke up
with his girlfriend "Cassandra"

66
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:11,201
I mean, what else could it be?

67
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:12,469
When I had millions of dollars,

68
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:14,387
I had no idea
why guys were coming to see me.

69
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:16,206
"Do they want me,
or do they want my money?"

70
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,707
But you have nothing!

71
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,143
So basically that just leaves you.

72
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:22,712
Way to puff me up
before I go through that door.

73
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:24,264
This is so exciting.

74
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,383
Will you stop?
Don't be such a girl.

75
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:29,686
Hair? Teeth? Anything?

76
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:31,021
You're good.

77
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:32,439
Wait.

78
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:37,560
More.

79
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:42,199
- Really?
- Trust me.

80
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,091
Oh, uh, hey, Johnny.
When did you get here?

81
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:52,292
Uh, just now.

82
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:53,543
I, uh--I came here

83
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,411
because I want to tell you something.

84
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:57,914
Yes?

85
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,268
Max, I think you and I
have something special.

86
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,553
And I don't want to lose that.

87
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:06,306
So I came down here to ask...

88
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:08,358
Even though it didn't work out,

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,643
can we still be friends?

90
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,528
- Oh.
- What?

91
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,114
You have got to be kidding!

92
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:15,315
Oh.

93
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:16,766
What's going on over there, Caroline?

94
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,785
My friend Johnny and I have no idea

95
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:20,153
what you're upset about.

96
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:22,939
I was just reacting to the
news that we're out of pie.

97
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,791
<i>I really cannot believe it.</i>

98
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:27,160
I totally thought it would go
a different way.

99
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:29,162
Caroline...

100
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:31,882
Why don't you go over there
to the pie carrousel

101
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:34,334
and mourn the loss of our pie?

102
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,121
So, we're cool?

103
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,923
Yeah, we're cool.
Why wouldn't we be?

104
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:41,975
We never dated or anything like that.

105
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,343
Of course we're friends.

106
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:44,511
I am so relieved.

107
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:46,563
So, uh, you gonna go back

108
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:48,565
to busting my balls, like always?

109
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,183
Yes.

110
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:52,269
We're such good friends,
I might just...

111
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,688
Bust them with my feet!

112
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,160
Good morning.

113
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:02,662
I'm trying to send out
a get-to-know-us email blast

114
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:03,830
for the cupcake business.

115
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:05,282
But your wi-fi is so slow.

116
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:08,318
Don't tell me--
tell cathyhome17,

117
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,003
whoever and wherever she is.

118
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,121
Okay, well, I'm just going

119
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:12,839
to run down to the coffee place
and send it.

120
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,823
Do you approve?

121
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:15,425
Nice job.
The font's pretty.

122
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:17,510
You just gave me a compliment?

123
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:18,878
I knew it--
you're depressed.

124
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,430
You're so depressed

125
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,715
about you and Johnny
just being friends,

126
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:23,683
you don't even have the energy
to be you.

127
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:25,185
What?
The font is pretty.

128
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:27,604
Oh, honey, do you want a hug?

129
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:30,440
- I'm fine.
- How could you be fine?

130
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:31,808
The man was so into you,

131
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,810
he painted a billboard
of the two of you kissing.

132
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:35,345
And now he just wants to be friends?

133
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:37,814
Please call in sick
to your babysitting job

134
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,115
and take to the bed.

135
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:40,483
Whenever I used to get depressed,

136
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:41,534
I'd take to the bed.

137
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:43,703
One time, I took to the bed
for a week.

138
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:45,905
Listen, unlike you, Jane Austen,

139
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:47,490
I will never take to the bed.

140
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:50,026
Giving into feelings
is for rich people.

141
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:51,578
Regular people just have to get up,

142
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,498
get drunk, and go fulfill
their babysitting duties.

143
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,700
Max, take to the bed.

144
00:05:57,702 --> 00:06:00,420
Look, this is my pattern, okay?

145
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:01,805
I fall for the wrong guy,

146
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,807
I find out they're with a girl,
a bottle, or a needle,

147
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:05,008
and I move on.

148
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,427
And sometimes I use a bottle
to help me do it...

149
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:10,430
Or a needle or a girl.

150
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,566
But when I'm done, I'm done.

151
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:14,768
That's it?

152
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,819
You're just over it?

153
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,270
Wow.

154
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:19,906
I'm still sad because
Kyle Enright didn't invite me

155
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:23,076
on his private jet to Mykonos
for his 12th birthday.

156
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:25,078
Well, not me.

157
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,831
Just flip a switch
and those feelings are gone.

158
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,699
I only have two switches
in my life--

159
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:31,501
one turns off my emotions,

160
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:34,204
the other makes a car bounce.

161
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:36,289
Okay, I better go.

162
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:39,175
If you get there after 10:30,
you can't hear yourself think

163
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:43,713
over the sounds of people
skyping to the Philippines.

164
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,750
Max, are you sure you're all right?

165
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:48,968
Max.

166
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,055
Are you about to come
over here and soft-touch me?

167
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:54,474
- I want to so bad.
- Leave!

168
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:57,527
Go to the coffee place.
Soft-touch the barista.

169
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:06,953
Excuse me, miss.

170
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:08,204
You keep your door open like that,

171
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:10,573
this rat's probably
going to get inside.

172
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:14,110
Don't worry. You should see
the size of my cat.

173
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,328
What are you doing here?

174
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,080
I knew you'd be home for another hour,

175
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:18,431
so I brought you coffee.

176
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:20,667
And I wanted to say...

177
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,969
Thanks for understanding
the situation.

178
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:24,287
Hey, you don't need to get all

179
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,557
"Hallmark presents:
Johnny Soft Eyes" on me.

180
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,893
Okay?
You're not my type, anyway.

181
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:31,644
You're a bartender
who's close to liquor all night

182
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,012
and your not an alcoholic.

183
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:36,599
So clearly you don't know
how to seize an opportunity.

184
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,570
Yes, I do.

185
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:49,428
This is where you join
in birthday song

186
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,397
with your sweet-ass saxophone.

187
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,916
Han, I like you, brother,

188
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,451
but I played with everyone

189
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:59,038
from Marvin Gaye to the gay Marvins.

190
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,041
They never made it--a little bit
ahead of their time.

191
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:04,994
But if you don't mind
a professional opinion, man,

192
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:08,164
you've got to put some heart
into this thing.

193
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,666
But my mother always say
to run away from heart--

194
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:12,218
only the head can make music.

195
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,221
Han, your mother sounds
like one cold--

196
00:08:15,223 --> 00:08:17,340
Don't you talk about my mama!

197
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:21,477
Hey, Earl.
What's up?

198
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,645
I just got threatened

199
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:25,297
by a man who gets carded
at Pixar movies.

200
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,800
Max, great news--

201
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:30,135
that email blast I sent out
this morning worked.

202
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:32,321
I just got us a big cupcake job

203
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:34,907
at some event place
called the gold space loft.

204
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,409
Last time I was
at the gold space loft,

205
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:40,663
I went to a poetry slam,
and I wound up slamming a poet.

206
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:43,115
They need 100 cupcakes
by tomorrow night.

207
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:44,200
And because I'm a genius,

208
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:45,751
and also because
it's such short notice--

209
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:47,253
but mostly
because I'm a genius--

210
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:49,121
I got them up to $500.

211
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:50,989
It's a cool
group art show--

212
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:54,377
very Williamsburg, very pot brownie.

213
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,678
And Johnny has a piece in it.

214
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,296
And since you flipped your switch,

215
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,764
I figured it'd be fine.

216
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:02,134
No way. I can't make
100 cupcakes in a day.

217
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:03,886
Max, I know it's a lot of work,

218
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,688
but I'll do whatever I can to help.

219
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,107
This is a really big
opportunity for us.

220
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:09,892
I kissed Johnny.

221
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:11,193
What? When?

222
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,646
He came by the apartment
right after you left.

223
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:14,947
I was only gone 20 minutes.

224
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,784
What'd you do--shine
a bat symbol on your vagina?

225
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:22,354
Stop acting like
I wanted it to happen.

226
00:09:22,356 --> 00:09:24,740
I didn't want it to happen.
I'm lucky we just kissed.

227
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:26,575
My pants kept saying,
"Take me off!"

228
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:29,361
And I'm like,
"No, pants."

229
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:33,165
I'm telling you,
I almost couldn't help myself.

230
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,167
I don't understand.

231
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:36,585
I thought you said
you were done with him.

232
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:37,920
What happened to your pattern?

233
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:40,205
Telling people I have a
pattern is part of the pattern.

234
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,841
Then I just go and do whatever I want.

235
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:44,059
I knew it, it thought it,
I should have said it--

236
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,811
girls cannot be friends with guys.

237
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:47,212
Yeah, well, you also knew
he was coming in here

238
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,148
to tell me he broke up
with his girlfriend.

239
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,150
So you can suck it.

240
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:52,985
Did he say he was going
to break up with her?

241
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,186
We didn't get into it.

242
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:56,155
We weren't really using
our mouths for talking.

243
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:58,524
What do you think's going to happen?

244
00:09:58,526 --> 00:09:59,942
I don't know.

245
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:01,744
All I know is it's not going
to happen at a public art show

246
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:03,245
in front of him
and his beautiful, cool

247
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,396
British girlfriend.

248
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:05,898
Max, you don't even have to see them.

249
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,033
We'll get there early,
we'll drop off the cupcakes,

250
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:10,119
and be gone before any
of the artists even show up.

251
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,754
Great.
I'm going home tonight

252
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,572
after my ten-hour
waitress shift,

253
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:15,624
to stay up all night
and bake 100 cupcakes

254
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:17,676
for a guy I kissed
who has a girlfriend.

255
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:18,928
Beep.

256
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,131
Ooh, what's that?
My self-esteem just flatlined.

257
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:26,519
Yeah, it's this way.

258
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,805
I smell patchouli and pretension.

259
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:31,106
Why are you walking so slow?

260
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:33,108
Because I'm carrying
our cupcake future,

261
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,894
and I don't want half
of our future's frosting

262
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,028
to be on top of the box.

263
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,481
Relax.
We still have time.

264
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:39,715
Oh, hello.

265
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:41,233
Welcome to space blast art attack.

266
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,369
The gallery won't be open
for, like, an hour.

267
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:45,037
Actually, we're here
delivering the cupcakes.

268
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,605
We're looking for someone
named Traivor.

269
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,491
And I'm looking for Traivor's mom,

270
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:51,327
to ask her why
she named a person Traivor.

271
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:52,795
Traive!

272
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:54,497
You girls can set up inside.

273
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,333
He's the one
with the super-tall hat.

274
00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:59,385
I love galleries.

275
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:01,387
My father and I had an art foundation.

276
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,756
We taught blind kids
how to do ceramics.

277
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:06,675
Why didn't you just buy them eyes?

278
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:08,344
Let's put them here.

279
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:10,462
This art show is ridiculous--

280
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:12,064
someone named Traivor,

281
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,183
a dreamcatcher
with buzzwords stuck in it.

282
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:16,986
And you.

283
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:19,471
Why would he hang that picture of us

284
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:20,823
if he still has a girlfriend?

285
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:22,525
Maybe he went home
and broke up with her

286
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:23,742
after he kissed you.

287
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:25,027
The writing is literally on the wall.

288
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,363
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for you again.

289
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:28,697
Let's just get our money and go.

290
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:30,749
Oh, uh...

291
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:33,118
Grown lady dressed like a doll,

292
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,954
we can't find tall hat,

293
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:36,872
and we need to get paid
for the cupcakes and leave.

294
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,374
Leave?
What are you talking about.

295
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:41,377
- You're serving the cupcakes.
- Pardon?

296
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,329
Well, why do you think we're
paying you $500 for cupcakes?

297
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:47,499
Because my friend's a genius.

298
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,668
This is new information.

299
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,021
We need to talk to someone.
Traive!

300
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:54,607
Oh, no. Traive is busy
installing his ice penis.

301
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:57,726
I could get someone else
on the show committee to help.

302
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:58,978
Cashandra!

303
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,480
What's his girlfriend doing here?

304
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:02,865
- Oh, God!

305
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,984
What if soft eyes wussed out
and told her what happened?

306
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,319
- Does she look mad?
- No, she looks amazing.

307
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:08,571
Max, hello.

308
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:10,122
We met that one time on the street.

309
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:11,657
Cashandra, Johnny's girlfriend.

310
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,626
Oh, hi, hi.
I'm Johnny's friend.

311
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:15,127
We're just friends.

312
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,246
Hi, "Cassandra."
I'm Caroline.

313
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,414
I was with Max on the street.

314
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,632
And all day yesterday.

315
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:22,134
We were together every minute.

316
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:23,669
It's Cash-andra, actually.

317
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:24,970
But everyone calls me Cash.

318
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:26,705
And you're Max's
business partner, right?

319
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:29,808
Yeah, but she makes her own decisions.

320
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,478
Right. Well, let's just
get to it, shall we?

321
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,179
I'm a bleeder.

322
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:36,148
It's brilliant it all worked out

323
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,550
- with the cupcakes.
- Excuse me?

324
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,185
Well, I told Traive
to hire you for the show.

325
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:42,988
Johnny cannot stop talking
about your cupcakes, Max.

326
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,823
"Max's cupcakes are so moist."

327
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:46,492
"Max's cupcakes are delicious."

328
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:48,243
He loves your cupcakes.

329
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,895
Yeah, yeah.

330
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:50,896
But just like in a casual way.

331
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:53,749
I mean, he barely even touched them.

332
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:56,535
So, um, I'm a bit busy
getting ready for the show.

333
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:58,621
Why don't you put your little
cupcakes on these trays,

334
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:01,006
and when people start coming in,
circulate, right?

335
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,992
Circulate, girls, circulate.

336
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:07,212
Well, that wasn't uncomfortable.

337
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:09,381
Come on, let's bolt
before Johnny gets here,

338
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:11,183
while I at least have
a shred of my dignity.

339
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,102
We can't just bail out
of our first big job.

340
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:14,937
If we do,
people will think we're flakes.

341
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:17,272
And that'll spread faster
through Williamsburg

342
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,774
than knit hats and herpes.

343
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:21,193
Hey, you ladies know
where the wine goes?

344
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:22,311
- Oh--
- Right here.

345
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:24,647
Yeah.

346
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,330
No! Just, uh, not the wine.
The wine's mine.

347
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:33,432
Just serving cupcakes.

348
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:36,168
I've been listening in on Cashandra

349
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,520
and her girlfriends' conversations,

350
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:38,971
and I don't think she knows
anything happened

351
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:40,055
between you two.

352
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,673
I also learned she's a dancer,

353
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:42,841
her lip gloss is from Kiehl's,

354
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:45,027
and she's school chums with Adele.

355
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,512
<i>Not the Adele.</i>

356
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:49,698
Damn it!
Could she be any cooler?

357
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,233
I want her to be my girlfriend.

358
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:53,486
I wouldn't break up with her for me.

359
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:55,704
Hi. I'm here.

360
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:58,491
Great. I was hoping
tonight would get weirder.

361
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:00,810
I had no idea.

362
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:02,127
She did it to surprise me.

363
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,695
And she did--
I'm surprised.

364
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:05,631
I am so sorry.

365
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,967
You have a girlfriend.
Why are you kissing Max?

366
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:09,201
You told her?

367
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:10,553
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

368
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:12,087
Would the more subtle way
be to paint a picture

369
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:15,474
and hang it on the wall
for all to see?

370
00:14:15,476 --> 00:14:16,842
Are you insane?

371
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:18,844
Could we have a moment, please?

372
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:19,895
Fine.

373
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:22,264
I'll be over there near the ice penis.

374
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:26,602
Look, I am so sorry.

375
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,938
If I had known Cash was going
to ask you to do all of this,

376
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,222
I would have told you.

377
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:32,057
And why would you choose to hang that?

378
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,943
'Cause it's my favorite piece.

379
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:36,161
Is there any way
she could know what happened?

380
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,414
No.

381
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,499
- Oh, my God. Your lips.
- Split up.

382
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:42,901
I can smell the sex
from across the room.

383
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:48,290
No-whoa-whoa!
I need all those.

384
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,259
So what?
Is she still your girlfriend?

385
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,627
Max, it's complicated.

386
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,179
What, are we on Facebook?

387
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:57,082
<i>It is complicated.</i>

388
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:58,417
Cash and I have been together
two years,

389
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,602
- and when--
- Two years?

390
00:14:59,604 --> 00:15:00,970
Jeez, I'm a home wrecker.

391
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:04,390
Adele will probably write
a song about me.

392
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:06,809
You're not a homewrecker.

393
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:08,427
- I am.
- Johnny!

394
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,563
You've got some folks.

395
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:13,098
Circulate, Max, circulate.

396
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:16,619
That's it.
This is over.

397
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,622
That--us on the wall--
never happens again.

398
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:21,240
I lied.
I can't be your friend.

399
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:23,375
I was trying to be cool,
but I'm not cool.

400
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,327
I don't know Adele.

401
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:28,581
What just happened over there?
Did he tell you

402
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,948
he's breaking up with his girlfriend?

403
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,167
No.
What's wrong with you?

404
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,136
You haven't been right about anything?

405
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:37,556
I told him we are done,
and that's over, okay?

406
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:40,142
They've been together two years.

407
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:42,811
And I know one thing about me--
I may pick the wrong guys,

408
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,630
but when I hear
another woman is involved,

409
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:45,681
I am done.

410
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:48,934
This is truly the end of my pattern.

411
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:50,736
We have to go--
I kissed Johnny again.

412
00:15:50,738 --> 00:15:52,154
What?
Max, you said

413
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:53,439
you were going to the bathroom.

414
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:54,990
I did.
And so did he.

415
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:56,325
It's a unisex bathroom--

416
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:59,111
emphasis on the sex.

417
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:00,245
We have to go.

418
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:01,997
I'm a little drunk and out of control.

419
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,116
Traive said we won't get paid

420
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:05,751
until every single one
of the cupcakes is gone.

421
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:07,319
- So we're stuck here.
- Fine.

422
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:09,121
I shall go circulate.

423
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:10,656
No. You cannot be trusted.

424
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:14,259
Next thing I know, you'll be
doing him behind the ice penis.

425
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:17,546
I'm telling you, I am done.

426
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:19,498
You told me that five minutes ago.

427
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,183
Well, you told me he was breaking up

428
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:22,668
with his girlfriend three times.

429
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,337
So I guess we learned tonight
that you know nothing about him,

430
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:26,972
and I know nothing about me.

431
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:28,440
Cheers!

432
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:30,809
Wait for me.

433
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:32,177
Hello, girls.

434
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:33,845
Traivor told me
you were looking to get paid.

435
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:35,681
But just to be clear,
you can't actually be paid

436
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:36,982
until all the cupcakes are gone.

437
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:38,317
And do me a favor, love,

438
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,952
put a chocolate aside for Johnny.

439
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:41,186
He loves chocolate.

440
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:42,788
He'll eat a vanilla if it's available,

441
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,040
but he always goes back to chocolate.

442
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,880
I don't think he's going
to break up with her.

443
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:54,032
Really?

444
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:59,555
You have the accuracy rate
of a magic 8 ball.

445
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,760
Look at her.
She's so pretty.

446
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,396
And bitchy.
And...

447
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:10,482
More pretty than bitchy.

448
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:13,051
Oh, God.
She just zipped his hoodie

449
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:15,821
and fixed his hair--
that's a couple.

450
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:17,106
What they have is real.

451
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,725
They are a couple--
Johnny and Cash.

452
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:23,495
Oh-ho, crap!
Johnny Cash!

453
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:27,065
They're an institution.

454
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,951
I never had a chance.

455
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:30,869
Forget the money--
let's just go.

456
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:32,070
Mm-mmm.

457
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:34,506
We are staying till
these cupcakes are gone.

458
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:37,376
I am not leaving
with no dignity and no money.

459
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:39,545
Fine, I'll circulate
a couple more times.

460
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:41,180
Wait a minute.

461
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:43,415
They said they had to be gone,

462
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:46,969
but they didn't say
who had to make them gone.

463
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:50,806
We eat them and go!

464
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,941
You're doing it!
I rescued you from the gutter.

465
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:57,029
Uh, well, that's
not entirely accura--

466
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,056
Mm-hmm!

467
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,245
Mmm, mmm.

468
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,557
Max, wake up.

469
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,642
It's 3:00.

470
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:27,810
We forgot to set the alarm.

471
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,847
Oh, I never thought waking up in bed

472
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,900
with another woman
with...Frosting on my boobs,

473
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:37,653
would be this depressing.

474
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:39,805
How are you feeling
about it all today?

475
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:40,906
Do you want to talk?

476
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:44,576
- No.
- Good.

477
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,173
Where's your purse?

478
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,758
I'm going to take some
of the money we made last night

479
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,126
and get coffee.
And yes--

480
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:02,828
I am walking down the street
like this,

481
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,932
because after last night,
I am impenetrable to shame.

482
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,934
Wait, we don't have any money.

483
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:10,335
- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't.

484
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:11,470
We did, but we don't.

485
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:14,189
I bought something with it.

486
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:16,692
I bought this.

487
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:19,895
You carried that home?
Where was I?

488
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,012
Three blocks ahead of me,

489
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:24,900
telling strangers about your pattern.

490
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,368
I saw you and Johnny
just hanging there,

491
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,203
and I knew what I had to do.

492
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,205
So what, am I supposed
to hang that up?

493
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:32,324
No. You're supposed
to destroy it.

494
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:35,527
You need to get over him,
so you're going to kick this,

495
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:37,329
and then you're going
to kick him once and for all.

496
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:38,747
You want to break your pattern?

497
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:40,532
Start by breaking the painting.

498
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:42,718
That is a complete waste of money.

499
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,920
I may have been wrong about
everything else about Johnny,

500
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:47,756
but I'm right about this.
Come on.

501
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:50,058
Kick it.

502
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:53,312
I can't.

503
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:55,013
- Give me your foot.
- What?

504
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,648
Lift up your leg.

505
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:01,770
Yay! You did it.

506
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,405
Good for you!

507
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:06,575
You broke a painting
and maybe your pattern.

508
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:09,528
I really liked him.

509
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,663
I know.

510
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:13,949
Well?

511
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,952
I slept through my day job,
so what the heck?

512
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,338
I think I will take to the bed
or whatever.

513
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,291
Just for like 20 minutes.

514
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:23,759
I'll set my alarm and then I'll get up

515
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,377
and get ready for work.

516
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:28,931
Max, please,
I feel like we need a hug.

517
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:31,683
We just slept together!
You women are so needy.
