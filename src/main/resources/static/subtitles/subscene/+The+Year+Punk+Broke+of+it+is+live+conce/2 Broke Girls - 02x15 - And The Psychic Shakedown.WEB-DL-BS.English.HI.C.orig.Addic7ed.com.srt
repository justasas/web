00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:04,187
Well, here it is.
My last tip.

2
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:05,588
Only $2.
[Sighs]

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,206
And to think, I held in a fart

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,341
for those cheap bastards.

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,043
This night sucks.

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,813
We don't even have enough to
buy supplies for tomorrow.

7
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:18,084
We'll just have to go to that
store where everything's free.

8
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:21,087
Oh, good.
They're open.

9
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,421
And we have to sneak
all this stuff out.

10
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,356
Han's staying late
to do inventory.

11
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,426
Damn it, why does he always
have to be so Asian?

12
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,061
Let's see, what do we need
for our cupcake shop?

13
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,831
- Eggs, sugar--
- A stripper pole?

14
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,866
Do you want to
make money or not?

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,668
How are we gonna hide
these eggs?

16
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,670
You could put some of those
"Grade A large"

17
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,939
where there's
"Grade A itty-bitties."

18
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,042
Rude, but I don't hate it.

19
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,678
I can probably fit
four to six in each.

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,179
So positive!

21
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,483
I love that you're a "cup's
half full" kind of person.

22
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,455
So come here often?

23
00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:59,291
This is my first time.

24
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,094
- Well, you're very pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

25
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,463
Heads up.
Han's coming your way.

26
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,098
Should I fake a stroke?

27
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,834
And P.S., if I don't get up
in three minutes,

28
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,736
it's a real one.

29
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,438
No, I'll deal with him.

You keep going.

31
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,580
Keep it up,
and we'll finally have

32
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,916
an answer to the question
"What comes first?

33
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,986

the greatest thing online.

40
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:47,012
The ultrasound
of the Kim and Kanye baby

41
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:48,613
where someone photoshopped
a "666"

42
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:51,416
on its little baby butt?

43

half Kardashian.

famous for doing nothing...

46
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,423
Just like its mom.

47
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:05,430
No, what I found is a site where we
can apply for a small business grant.

48
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:07,832
There's a couple of categories:
Women-owned business--

49
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,301
No thanks.
I've been to jail.

50
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:12,270
I was already owned
by a woman.

51
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:15,173
There's also
a minority-owned category.

52
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:17,309
You don't know who your father is,
and you do have an exotic look.

53
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,177
Any chance he could be
Native American?

54
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:20,912
Yes, in fact, I think his name

55
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:23,148
was Chief Running Away.

56
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:24,783
Wait.

57
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:26,584
Maybe we don't even
need your father.

58
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,886
We are white,

59
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:29,587
which according to
the last presidential election,

60
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:31,523
is the new minority.

61
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:34,559
So now all we need is
a letter of recommendation

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,728
from someone who owns
another start-up business.

63
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,196
I was thinking
of a recommendation

64
00:02:38,197 --> 00:02:39,998
from Candy Andy's
Sweets and Treats.

65
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,067
I've already written it,
so he just has to sign it.

66
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:45,070
Will you ask Andy?
I can't, he's my ex.

67
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:48,239
And I'm saving up my favor for
a booty call on a cold night.

68

Why don't you look

- He didn't even leave a note?
- Or a razzle?

Max?
Max, I really need to talk.

176
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,321
[Knocking on door]

177
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,823
Oh, just come in
and get it over with.

178
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,559
Everybody else does.

179
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,195
Max, I'm sorry,
but I really need to talk.

180
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:37,030
I went to the fortune teller
near the diner,

181
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:39,400
and she told me that
I'd never find love in my life.

182
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:41,435
Fortune-telling's a scam.

183
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:44,004
"You'll never find a man,
your moon's in Uranus,

184
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,672
no man will ever be
in Uranus."

185
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,108
I could've told you that
the second day I met you.

186
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:50,177
Please, Max,
just listen for five minutes.

187
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,779
Come over here.
I'll make you some tea.

188
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,348
Tea?
Who am I, Pippa Middleton?

189
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:57,551
Toast me an eggo waffle
and maybe I'm listening.

190
00:07:57,552 --> 00:07:58,852
Well, we were
saving that waffle

191
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,155
for a special occasion,
but okay.

192
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:04,489
Chestnut, we're eating
your birthday waffle now.

193
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,060
I don't know
why I'm pissing him off.

194
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:09,463
He's gonna be the only man
in my life.

195
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:12,797
I can't believe you blew $10
on a psychic.

196
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,068
Why didn't you just buy
a Skinnygirl Margarita

197
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:17,771
like all
the other lonely white chicks?

198
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:19,573
I spent $50.

199
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:22,576
I bought a crystal
that protects me from bad juju.

200
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:25,910
Hey! There's no reason
to get anti-semitic.

201
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:29,149
You spent money on crystal
you can't snort?

202
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,185
What is wrong with you?

203
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:34,054
I freaked out.
I didn't want it to be true.

204
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,590
Is it true, Max?
Am I never gonna find love?

205
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:38,025
Was Andy my one chance?

206
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:39,359
Did I screw it up
because I wanted success?

207
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,794
Was everyone right?

208
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:44,128
That is a lot of questions
for one waffle.

209
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:46,667
And where is that waffle?
[Smacks counter]

210
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,168
You're a bad waitress
at home too.

211
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,571
[Knock on door]

212
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:50,871
Who could that be?

213
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:53,140
I don't know.
Let me consult the spirits.

214
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:55,776
[Mockingly] Who is it?

215
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:58,479
It's Sophie.

216
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,948
Yeah, it's me,

217
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:04,282
the shady lady
with the illegal business.

218
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,421
Yeah, and Caroline,
you owe me an apology

219
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,755
or I will take out
these hoops,

220
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,089
and we will get into it, girl.

221
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:14,228
Yeah, and I warn you,

222
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:17,562
I did some extreme fighting
in Warsaw.

223
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,766
Extreme fighting?
That's awesome.

224
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,635
Yeah, they would throw

225
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:23,136
a big hunk of cheese
in a trough

226
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:26,470
and let all the village girls
just go at it.

227
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:28,942
Sorry, Sophie.

228
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,644
It just seemed like
a better business decision

229
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,246
to go with the forgery.

230
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,214
What is that?

231
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:36,950
[Gasps]
Is that a waffle?

232
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,284
[Laughs]

233
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,284
Okay!
You are forgiven.

234
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:43,991
Damn it.
I didn't even get a bite.

235
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:45,893
I'm awake and sober
for nothing.

236
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:48,495
Sophie, do you believe
in psychics?

237
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:51,198
Oh, no.
That's all fake.

238
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,367
You know, I knew a family
of gypsy psychics

239
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:55,335
who couldn't even predict
that they would all die

240
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:57,571
in a barn fire.

241
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:00,274
Hey, girls.
Sorry to interrupt,

242
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:03,410
but Sophie promised
to rub antifungal cream

243
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,979
on my thick, yellow toenails.

244
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,581
[Mouth full]
Oleg, come over here.

245
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:10,915
I'll do it in between bites.

246
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,887
This is what you're afraid
you're missing?

247
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:16,056
Because
this is a relationship.

248
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:18,692
Seriously, Max.
That's something I really want.

249
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:21,395
And now
I'm never gonna have it.

250
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:24,565
Get in there, baby.
I have two feet.

251
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,601
[Bell chimes]

252
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:28,702
Interesting.

253
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:31,171
She's a psychic,
but she needs a bell

254
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,507
to tell her someone's here.
[Door closes]

255
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,842
Max, please
don't make me do this.

256
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,011
I don't want to hear
any more bad things.

257
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,880
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

258
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,214
She's gonna tell you you have

259
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,050
a bright, love-filled future

260
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:46,219
or I'm gonna kick her
in the crystal balls.

261
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,654
Hello, girls.

262
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,790
I'll tell you your future
as soon as I finish eating.

263
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,191
It'll only take a minute.

264
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,525
Since I quit smoking,
I eat like a prisoner.

265
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,862
Come, sit, ruminate
on your wishes and dreams.

266
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:01,565
Well, my wish is that you give
my friend her money back,

267
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,204
and my dream is
that I'm a backup dancer

268
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,973
for Missy Elliott.

269
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:09,710
Great. A wise-ass.

270
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,812
Do you want to know
your future or not?

271
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:13,614
Um, you already told me
my future.

272
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:14,615
That's why we're here.

273
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:16,316
You said I'd never find love.

274
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:18,619
When did I say that?

275
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,788
And you, tough guy, don't say,
"Well, you're the psychic."

276
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,658
Maybe she is a psychic,
because I am a tough guy

277
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,327
and I was gonna say that.

278
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:28,729
You know,
it's hard to remember.

279
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,964
I see a lot
of sad, single girls.

280
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,299
But looking at you right now,

281
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,568
it makes sense.

282
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,304
And here.
Take your phony crystal back.

283
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,339
And I'm not so sure
this is a real crystal.

284
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,673
It looks like one of
those vegan deodorant things.

285
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:44,911
And we want our money.

286
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,280
[Hisses]

287
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:50,614
Oh, okay.
What just happened?

288
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,887
I put a curse on you.

289
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:56,590
Max, you said nothing bad
was gonna happen!

290
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,924
Well, I'm not a psychic,
and neither is she.

291
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:02,496
Laugh, Buster.

292
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,531
Nothing in life
will go your way,

293
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:06,700
and you will live
under a dark cloud.

294
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:09,503
[Scoffs]
Will this dark cloud merge

295
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,371
with the current dark cloud
above me

296
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,974
or fly alongside of it?

297
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,209
Look, we don't want
to trouble you,

298
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,844
but if you could
remove the curse

299
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:21,014
and possibly that noodle
on your blouse...

300
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,083
[Hisses]

301
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:26,687
Oh, no.
Did you just--

302
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,321
Cursed you too.

303
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:31,655
Tell you what.
I'll lift both curses for 50,

304
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,661
or else your whole life
will come crashing down

305
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:36,329
all around you.

306
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,663
The only way I'm giving
a strange woman 50 bucks

307
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:43,534
is if I'm walking out of here
with a genital piercing.

308
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:47,808
I do that as well.

309
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:50,644
[Bell chimes]

310
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,413
Don't believe in curses,
never have.

311
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:55,415
Not since Jennifer Martin
told me I was going to hell

312
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,817
for sleeping
with her boyfriend.

313
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,018
But I didn't.

314
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,653
I just ended up going
to homecoming with him.

315
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,688
Max, we have to go back
and pay her.

316
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:03,090
Our lives are hard enough.

317
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:05,492
We don't need things to come
crashing down around us.

318
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,826
Relax. Nothing's coming
crashing down around us.

319
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,132
Don't jump, Paul!
Paul, don't jump!

320
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,333
Paul? Who's Paul?

321
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,634
Oh.

322
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:16,603
And what is he doing
on the roof?

323
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,106
[Thud]
[Screams]

324
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,674
Okay.

325
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,577
That was Paul's life
that came crashing down,

326
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:25,645
not ours.

327
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:31,573
Max, I think we all know that

328
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:33,074
I'm a highly educated woman

329
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,609
who doesn't really believe
in curses,

330
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,511
but I am putting every penny
we make tonight

331
00:13:36,512 --> 00:13:37,879
in the "lift the curse" fund.

332
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,381
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

333
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:42,450
we're not spending
another 50 bucks

334
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:43,685
on some stupid curse.

335
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:47,019
A body fell from the sky!

336
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,641
Paul got a bad batch
of shrooms.

337
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:52,276
It had nothing to do
with the curse.

338
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:54,745
Everyone knows
you don't take psychedelics

339
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,448
above the second floor.

340
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:59,617
Poor amateur bastard.

341
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:02,787
And we need our money
for essentials, like food

342
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:06,121
and the penguin statue
I saw at the Dollar Store.

343
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:09,457
The one that says
"Chill out."

344
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:11,195
So chill out.

345
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,931
Caroline, I feel bad

346
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:16,400
about not signing your letter
of recommendation.

347
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:18,436
So I wrote one myself
and signed it.

348
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,004
Here.

349
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,772
That's so nice of you.

350
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:24,775
"The extremely hardworking
Caroline Channing,

351
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,244
"who has devoted her life
to business

352
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:29,080
and nothing
and no one else."

353
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:31,916
Han, this is supposed
to be about getting a loan,

354
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,517
not being alone.

355
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:36,354
I totally get it, girl.
I'm alone as well.

356
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:39,457
We have our eyes on the prize,
so our beds are empty.

357
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,791
But occasionally,
I pay for it.

358
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,301
Did Han just intimate

359
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:53,635
that he occasionally
gets a hooker?

360
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:56,641
Lucky bastard.

361
00:14:57,342 --> 00:14:59,975
He probably gets
a child's discount.

362
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:05,347
Max, look.
The future's already happening.

363
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,218
Even in Han's letter,
I'm alone.

364
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,053
The only chance for
a love life I have now

365
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:11,289
is going halfsies on a hooker
with Han.

366
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,758
We have to reverse
the curse now.

367
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,727
News flash:
Everybody is cursed.

368
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:18,863
You lost your money last year.

369
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:22,197
Literally nothing good
has ever happened to me.

370
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:25,002
Han hasn't grown
since the fourth grade.

371
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:28,836
Oleg's toenails
look like Fritos.

372
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,375
And Earl was born black at
the eighth-or ninth-worst time

373
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,514
to be a black man in America.

374
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:39,848
Look around,
it's the valley of the damned.

375
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,620
Name one person
who isn't cursed.

376
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:43,921
Hey, guys!

377
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:46,991
I just found a $100 bill
on the sidewalk!

378
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:49,327
Drinks for everyone!

379
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,963
Max,
pop open the fancy brandy.

380
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,298
"Fancy Brandy"
is gonna be my stripper name

381
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:56,934
if you ever let me
put in that pole.

382
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:58,069
Sophie, guess what?

383
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,870
We went back to that psychic
to complain,

384
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,639
and she put a curse on us.

385
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,973
Oh.
You're cursed?

386
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:10,445
Uh...

387
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,883
[Groaning]

388
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:19,056
But it's stupid,
like you said, right?

389
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:22,390
Yeah, yeah.
That's stupid.

390
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:24,395
Yeah.

391
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:27,729
Did she mention me?

392
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,767
No.

393
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:31,836
She just cursed us and said

394
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,872
our whole lives would
come crashing down around us.

395
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:36,774
[Shelf crashes]

396
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:40,108
[Screaming]

397
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:46,181
And 30, 40, 50.

398
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:50,485
[Hisses]
The curse is lifted.

399
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:53,491
Oh, I don't think you got me.
What about my curse?

400
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,459
[Hisses]

401
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,561
Talk about phoning it in.

402
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,697
Couldn't you wave a feather
or spin your head

403
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:01,499
or throw up or something?

404
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,702
That's extra.

405
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:06,737
You know what?
I'm in a good mood tonight.

406
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,373
I got through the whole day
on 15 cigarettes

407
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:10,641
and one sheet cake.

408
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:13,975
I'm gonna give tough guy
a free reading here.

409
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,612
Oh, free, as in the $50
you just shook us down for?

410
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:21,049
[Laughs, coughs]

411
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,953
Should never have quit.
Okay.

412
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,324
Future coming right at you.

413
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:29,994
I see that you will
have a happy life.

414
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:31,862
[Scoffs]
Me, happy?

415
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:33,864
All right, get your hat,
mother. We're leaving.

416
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:37,198
And I see a large sum of money
coming your way.

417
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:39,403
Over $10,000.

418
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,372
Max, it's the grant.

419
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,541
We applied for $12,000.
Is that it?

420
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,343
- Sure.
- [Gasps]

421
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:49,180
And in spite
of your bad childhood...

422
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:50,815
[Gasps] She knew
you had a bad childhood.

423
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,983
Come on,
every childhood is bad.

424
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,552
You're stupid.
You can't reach stuff.

425
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:56,887
It's rough.

426
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:58,255
In spite of it,

427
00:17:58,256 --> 00:18:01,589
I see great love and children
in your future.

428
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,928
Max.

429
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,830
Me? [Laughs]
No, wait.

430
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:07,164
You must be picking up
on her vibes.

431
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:08,265
Check again.

432
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:11,899
No, great love and children

433
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:14,270
will be part of your future.

434
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:18,976
She will die alone.

435
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:20,811
Okay, well,
that's all I can take.

436
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,947
I'm not gonna sit here and wait
for the other Paul to fall.

437
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:24,448
- Let's go, Max.
- No, no, no, no.

438
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,649
No, no. Wait.

439
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,983
She obviously got it wrong.
Didn't you?

440
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:33,257
Nope.
Still dying alone...

441
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:35,960
With nothing
but her great success.

442
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,795
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What?

443
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,464
I see great success
in your future.

444
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:42,967
You do?
Oh, thank God.

445
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,803
I'm gonna have success?
How big a success?

446
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:46,971
Oh, honey, it's so big,

447
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:50,207
you won't even know
you're alone.

448
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,212
All right, go.

449
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:58,449
May you live
a long and healthy life.

450
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,217
And put on your hat
and gloves.

451
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:03,551
I'm predicting snow.
[Coughs]

452
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:09,326
It's not going to snow.

453
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:12,163
At most, it's gonna rain
30-year-old dudes.

454
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:14,198
Maybe she isn't so psychic.

455
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,833
Stop fighting it, Max.

456
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,234
You're gonna find love
and be happy,

457
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:19,270
and I'm gonna be successful.

458
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,371
You hear that, New York?

459
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,705
I'm gonna be
successful and alone!

460
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:27,711
And robbed and raped
if you keep calling that out.

461
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,313
And it all started
when I dropped

462
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:31,415
that grant application
into that mailbox

463
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,651
that those guys are unbolting
and taking away.

464
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,119
What's going on?

465
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,154
It's called emails.

466
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,657
We're getting rid of this.
No one mails anything anymore.

467
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:41,825
Yes, they do.
I did yesterday.

468
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:44,195
And our $12,000 depends on it.

469
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,462
Sorry, doll.

470
00:19:45,463 --> 00:19:47,231
This box has been
out of commission for a week.

471
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:49,333
According to a psychic,
her box is gonna be

472
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,268
out of commission forever.

473
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:52,436
We had to tell him.

474
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:55,472
You expect me to lie
to a city employee?

475
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:58,509
So I guess
we're not getting that grant.

476
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,611
The psychic was wrong.

477
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:02,880
Maybe nothing she said
is gonna come true.

478
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:06,150
I told you, it's a scam.

479
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:08,419
Max, look.

480
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,655
It's snowing.
And she predicted snow.

481
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:14,989
Oh, crap!
Am I gonna have kids?

482
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:18,162
So she was right on snow,
but not on the money.

483
00:20:18,163 --> 00:20:20,164
So what is it?

484
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:23,067
Am I or am I not gonna die
old and alone?

485
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,035
Why are we even
talking about this?

486
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,638
We're probably not gonna
make it through the winter.

487
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:30,941
And by the way,
if you die first,

488
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:32,876
I am totally eating you.

489
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:34,845
Oh. I know.

490
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:36,413
And besides,

491
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:38,482
no one person can get it all.

492
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:39,850
You're right.

493
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:42,853
No one person can,
but what about two?

494
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:44,521
You'll have
the love and the kids

495
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:45,689
and I'll have success.

496
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,891
Maybe we can share,
like we share our tips

497
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:50,527
or that wheat thin we found
in your pillowcase.

498
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:52,896
Are you asking to bang
my great love?

499
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:55,232
Which is fine with me,
because I'm already bored

500
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,635
and sleeping with
his poker buddy.

501
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,036
In fact, let's switch.

502
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:01,605
You can have my great love,
and I'll die alone.

503
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:04,275
Max, you don't want
to die alone.

504
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:07,609
I am dying to die alone.
