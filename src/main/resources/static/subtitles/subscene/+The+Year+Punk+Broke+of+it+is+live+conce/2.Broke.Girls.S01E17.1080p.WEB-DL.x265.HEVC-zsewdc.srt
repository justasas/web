1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,411
So that's three of our
delicious homemade cupcakes.

2
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:07,796
Nope, can't.
You touched them.

3
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:12,250
Sorry, flu season, no health care.

4
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:16,755
You realized I replaced that
Purell with K.Y., right?

5
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,974
Max, please say you're kidding.

6
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:20,625
Of course, I'm kidding.

7
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:23,845
I can't afford lube.
I just use my tears.

8
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:27,298
Max, seriously, don't mess
with my hand sanitizer.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,267
I've already caught poverty this year

10
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:31,403
and I refuse to catch the flu.

11
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:34,606
I just have to keep cleaning my
hands and not touch anyone.

12
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:37,158
Caroline, I have check from table ten.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,912
Okay, just place it right there.

14
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:45,867
That's a big tip, wow--

15
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,205
You know, in Indonesia,
you'd be married now.

16
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,333
I'm gonna get sick, I know it.

17
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:03,385
You're fine.

18
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:06,805
Fine? Han just unloaded into my mouth.

19
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:12,610
Congratulations, you both
finally got some action.

20
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:14,529
I can't afford to
get sick and miss work.

21
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,897
I need to get some antibiotics.

22
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,282
You are poor now.

23
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:19,701
Poor people don't just run out
and buy antibiotics.

24
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:23,238
We man up, grow a pair,
stare germs in the face.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,957
Like this French fry from that
guy who couldn't stop coughing.

26
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,208
Max, no, no--oh!

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,543
Mmm.

28
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:30,145
Booyah!

29
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:32,714
And I haven't ever been sick
or to a clinic.

30
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:36,000
And, no, planned parenthood
doesn't count.

31
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:40,422
Well, well, well, she weebles
and she wobbles,

32
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:43,558
but she don't fall down.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,478
Oh, Earl, you're so naughty and nice.

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,899
And I'll be checking you out twice.

35
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,401
Hey, Sophie, sit anywhere you like.

36
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:54,903
Oh, uh, let's see.

37
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:58,273
Where is lighting that will make
me look most attractive?

38
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,832
I wonder if he's here yet.

39
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,400
Well unless you've been cruising

40
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:12,587
singles who don't leave enough
singles, I'd say no.

41
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:15,924
You know, Max, if my date
turned out to be big bust--

42
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:16,958
what, bigger than ours?

43
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,128
Then you come over and say that

44
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,048
something suddenly came up and
that I have to go, okay?

45
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,968
Oh, my gosh, this must be him.

46
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:32,273
You must be Sophie Kuchenski.

47
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:33,925
I'm Serguisz Bilowski.

48
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:35,944
Oh.

49
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:39,364
Wow, I love your dress, I love that!

50
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:42,650
Something came up and you have to go.

51
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:44,986
No, no this is perfect.

52
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,938
Would you like to sit down?

53
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,957
Just let me run to
the little boys rooms first.

54
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,626
- Okay?
- Okay.

55
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:53,294
Who is that?

56
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,130
That's Sophie's new boyfriend.

57
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:58,416
I see, and where's his boyfriend?

58
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:04,589
Hello.

59
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:05,974
Nice to see you again.

60
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:10,428
I'm wearing my velour
especially for you.

61
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,817
And right now, it's the only
thing soft about me.

62
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,971
Please go away before my date
comes back from the men's room.

63
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,806
You have brought other man in here?

64
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:24,492
Yes, I met him on Polish dating site.

65
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:28,196
On polemeetpole.com

66
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:32,984
you didn't have to go online.
You could meet my pole any time.

67
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:35,670
No, this will never happen.

68
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:36,838
You're not my type.

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,456
Well, what is your type?

70
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:44,379
Wow, they have those automatic
hand dryers that blow you.

71
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:47,715
I love being blown like that.

72
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:51,052
Those look like two giant
orange traffic cones.

73
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:56,691
Are you trying to tell me
not to park there?

74
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,443
This is a lady.

75
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:01,646
Show her some respect.

76
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:04,649
Sophie has new man in her life.

77
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:07,368
I am so mad I cannot see straight.

78
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,572
Well, I'm looking right at him
and I don't see straight either.

79
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:16,244
Max, I think I'm running a slight fever.

80
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:17,795
Feel my forehead.

81
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:21,833
Look, you should have learned
by now-- I don't feel anything.

82
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:24,252
Caroline, I've written down
address of drug store

83
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:26,921
in South Williamsburg that
has a doctor on site.

84
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:28,806
Here, I will pay for it.

85
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:29,891
Unless it is cancer.

86
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:32,760
Then I'm out.

87
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:36,264
And, Max, here is check for table seven.

88
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:41,102
Booyah!

89
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,342
How long is it gonna
take to see a doctor?

90
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:49,678
I'm definitely getting
something-- I'm pre-sick.

91
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,929
I'm stage one pre-sick.

92
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:52,180
I need penicillin.

93
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:54,349
I told you before, you have to man up

94
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,968
and not give in to this sick stuff.

95
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,969
I'm not like you.

96
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:59,471
I have actual things I feel.

97
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,473
Menachem Goldman.

98
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,692
Menachem Goldman.

99
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,196
This must be the orthodox
Jewish neighborhood.

100
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:11,400
Either that or we're in ZZ Top-ville.

101
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,485
Max, have some respect.

102
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,237
Hey, I got nothing but respect.

103
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:19,074
They basically invented southern rock.

104
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:20,942
I love the Jewish people.

105
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,995
Whenever I felt sick before,
I'd just pop over

106
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:25,247
to the townhouse next door
and visit Dr. Klein.

107
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:27,215
So your love was contingent on pills?

108
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:29,584
We're not that different.

109
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:31,619
Actually, the Kleins
and I were very close.

110
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:34,122
I was invited to many
a Passover in their home.

111
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:37,809
In fact, they called me
their honorary Jew.

112
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:39,978
Rivka Shemshelewitz.

113
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,815
Rivka Shemshelewitz.

114
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:46,318
Well, you're no Rivka Shemshelewitz.

115
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,488
Mrs. Klein always said
I had a Bissel Jew.

116
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,606
You had a Jewish vacuum cleaner?

117
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:52,658
No.
Bissel.

118
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,326
It's a Yiddish word.
It means little.

119
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:56,862
And this one time I had a bissel flu

120
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:58,997
and she brought me
chicken soup every day.

121
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,149
So why don't you just
give Dr. Klein a call?

122
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:03,669
I did three times and no return.

123
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:05,454
I guess he doesn't want anything
to do with me anymore

124
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,756
because of my father's
financial scandal.

125
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:09,991
All those years I thought
we were family.

126
00:06:09,993 --> 00:06:10,992
Guess not.

127
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:12,127
I don't know, ignoring your

128
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,712
needs and pretending you don't exist?

129
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:15,430
Sounds like family to me.

130
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:18,550
Caroline Channing, Caroline Channing.

131
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,602
Finally.

132
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:21,669
Let me do the talking.

133
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:23,671
I learned a lot of
Hebrew from Mrs. Klein.

134
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:26,058
These are my people.

135
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,343
Hello, shalom.

136
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:32,514
Very good, you wanna squeeze
in a couple more before sundown?

137
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:36,017
Wow, you're as bad
as me trying to be Irish

138
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,353
at the blarney rose for a free beer.

139
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:42,690
Yar, can I get me a cerveza?

140
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:43,825
What can I get you ladies,

141
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:46,244
besides skirts that
are more appropriate?

142
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:48,213
Sorry, I didn't know it
was an orthodox neighborhood.

143
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,716
You know what, we could just tie
our coats around our waists.

144
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:52,501
Max?

145
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,536
Oh, and look at the breasts on this one.

146
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:56,538
Coat on or off?
Make up your mind.

147
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,307
No, Bubala, I'm just saying,
with those big breasts

148
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,978
and that gorgeous hair it's
like looking in a mirror.

149
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,231
It's been a few years, but trust
me, under this wig and smock,

150
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,849
spitting image of you.

151
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,384
Here you go, Esther Rachael.

152
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:10,519
How else do you think I landed

153
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,521
a handsome doctor like my Anshell?

154
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:13,822
Oh, doctor?

155
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,023
Doctor?
Doctor, if you could--

156
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:17,559
oh, oh, what is that
Hebrew word for wait?

157
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:20,362
You might wanna start
peppering in some English.

158
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,663
Now, Chava?

159
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,949
Now you're telling me
you're too sick to bake.

160
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:25,283
I need 80 cupcakes.

161
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:26,835
The bar mitzvah is tomorrow.

162
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:30,071
You're dead to me!
See you next week.

163
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,906
- We could help.
- We can?

164
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,675
Yeah, give me the card.

165
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,845
Hi, I'm Max and my friend and I
here have a cupcake business

166
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,597
and we'd be happy to
bake as many cupcakes

167
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:39,798
as you need for the bar mitzvah.

168
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,749
I mean, you need cake, we make cake.

169
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,218
It's bashert.

170
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,105
Look, enough with the "it's a
small Hebrew world after all."

171
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:48,473
How does 250 sound?

172
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,142
No way, 275.

173
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,560
I have to bake all morning.

174
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:54,929
It's like looking in a mirror.

175
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,081
They're kosher, right?

176
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,765
Are they kosher? Look at me.

177
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,701
Like looking in a mirror.

178
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:01,236
Good, I'll call you with the address.

179
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:03,455
Esther Rachael, if I could
talk to you husband

180
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:04,606
about getting some antibiotics--

181
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:06,829
sorry, sundown.

182
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:17,695
Okay, I've got the kosher
cookbook, salt, flour, sugar,

183
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,365
new mixing bowls, and I
stopped at the goodwill

184
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,533
and got us two appropriately

185
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,552
sad schmatas to wear for tomorrow.

186
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:24,536
Let's start.

187
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,722
Start?
I'm already half done.

188
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:27,872
How could you be half done?

189
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,307
You didn't have any kosher ingredients.

190
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,559
Oh, they'll never know, we'll just

191
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,593
tell them they're kosher.

192
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,379
Oh, my God, we can't do that.

193
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,648
Oh, my God, we just did.

194
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,600
They have to be kosher.

195
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,051
Do you want God to smite us?

196
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,186
What's he gonna do?

197
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,438
Take away all my good luck
and your fortune?

198
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,558
You think all those things
labeled low fat are low fat?

199
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,326
It is just a sales gimmick.

200
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,861
I had a low cal ice cream bar once

201
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,830
that popped my top Jean button.

202
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,199
Kosher isn't a sales gimmick.

203
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,084
It's thousands of years of tradition.

204
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:57,235
We have to respect that.

205
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,121
I don't respect anyone's tradition.

206
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,122
That's kind of my tradition.

207
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,757
Well maybe that's because

208
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,542
you didn't grow up around a family.

209
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,794
Hey, I grew up with a lot of families.

210
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,931
The Manson family, the Jackson
family, the Menendezes.

211
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,100
Wait, is that Menendezes or Menen-di?

212
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:14,636
Either way, they were like
brothers to me.

213
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,855
Max, we are doing these
straight up kosher.

214
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,223
Fine.

215
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,108
But return those new bowls,
I don't need them.

216
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,310
I can just dump the bacon bits
out of this old one.

217
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,197
Max, please, let's just
start the cupcakes over,

218
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,149
drop them off, get me some antibiotics,

219
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,433
come home, and put me to bed.

220
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,118
All right, I'll make them kosher.

221
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,821
I mean, it's the least
you could do after you

222
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,440
lied to that woman and let her
think you were one of them.

223
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,075
Hey, I don't know who my father is.

224
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,293
I could be half Jewish.

225
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:40,545
Although it's more likely
I'm half bartender

226
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,548
who demanded my mom figure out
a way to pay her tab.

227
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,585
- Hey!
- Hello.

228
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,970
Serguisz and I are on
way up to my apartment.

229
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,422
He's making me brunch.

230
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,508
Cornish hens splashed
with my special sauce.

231
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,344
I love special sauce, I love that!

232
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,980
Yeah, and I stopped by
because I was hoping you girls

233
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,982
might have some spare
cupcakes for dessert.

234
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:02,601
Only about 40 of them.

235
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,302
Oh, good!

236
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,654
I'll go up and get started.

237
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,272
Sophie, can I have you keys?

238
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,642
- Oh, yeah.
- Cute place.

239
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,994
Ah, I have keychain just like this.

240
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,779
We are birds of a feather.

241
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,665
I love that!

242
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,099
See, girls.

243
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,318
This is what I like about
my new boyfriend.

244
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,003
He loves so many things.

245
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:23,421
And vagina ain't one of them.

246
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,756
Max!

247
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:25,841
We don't know that.

248
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,992
Sexuality is more fluid these days.

249
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,263
It's okay.
He's big, big gay.

250
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:33,849
So... You know he's gay?

251
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:34,850
Oh, know it?

252
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:36,351
I prefer it.

253
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:39,271
Yeah, my ex-husband
was large male bully.

254
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:43,024
Yeah, all rough sex
and stains in shorts.

255
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:47,445
Now all I want is a man who will
spoon me and stay soft.

256
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,648
But what about sex?

257
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,868
Oh, no one does me better than me.

258
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,542
That's the last of them.

259
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,543
Look at us.

260
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:03,211
I think we look very nice.

261
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:04,162
Really?

262
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,048
I think we look like the Olson twins.

263
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,300
Well hello, girls.

264
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:09,801
You look very lovely.

265
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,753
Mazel tov to the family.

266
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,755
What a mitzvah to be part of this day.

267
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,006
How bashert.

268
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,874
Oh, we're still on that ride?

269
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,059
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,678
It's just, I'm so happy to be

271
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,179
in your warm and wonderful home.

272
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,765
I was very close to my
neighbors, the Kleins.

273
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,518
In fact, they called me
their honorary Jew.

274
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,435
Stop now.

275
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,553
This is like when you tell Earl

276
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,274
you're practically black.

277
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,909
We'll just get our money and go.

278
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:35,193
Take our money and go?

279
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,528
What are we, barbarians?

280
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,164
Stay and celebrate a little.

281
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,899
But, out here in the kitchen,
away from the men.

282
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,702
Sit, eat, come.

283
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:47,739
Three of my favorite things to do.

284
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,575
Good looks and funny.
What a catch.

285
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,677
Hadassa, hand me a spoon.

286
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,715
All 100% kosher and so
gorgeous you could plotz.

287
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,134
This one's seen some
Streisand movies, yes?

288
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,020
Wait until you taste my kugel.

289
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,755
Oh, I love kugel.

290
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,525
Tell me, Esther Rachael, are you
ashkenzi or sephardic Jews?

291
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,811
Someone's been on the Internet.

292
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:13,365
No way, this is a pasta and a dessert?

293
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,433
Ooh, there he is.

294
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,252
My only son.
My little angel.

295
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:20,772
The bar mitzvah boy who,
today, becomes a man.

296
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:24,042
Girls, this is Shmuley and his
friend from next door, David.

297
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:27,262
Say hello to the girls who made
the cupcakes, boys.

298
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:30,114
Nice to meet you.

299
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,333
Hadassa, Devorah, enough.

300
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,617
Thank you, go.

301
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,118
Enjoy the party.

302
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,103
Have more kugel.

303
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:37,005
I'll go ask my husband for your money.

304
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,807
See, this is what I love, Max.

305
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,342
The family, the tradition.

306
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,978
The lasagna with the crazy raisins.

307
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,679
And those two little boys,

308
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,264
could they have been more precious?

309
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,484
Yo, yo, yo, what up cupcake bitches?

310
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,522
I'm fixin' to marry me a beeyatch

311
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,741
who bakes like this, son.

312
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,477
Uh, I don't know what's going on,

313
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,196
but I'm pretty sure boys
and girls aren't

314
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,747
supposed to be socializing, right?

315
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:06,084
Damn, sweetness, your lips are moving

316
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:10,121
but your ass is doing all the talking.

317
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,591
Uh... Is that Yiddish?

318
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,877
Oh, boys, there you are, come on.

319
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,629
Say goodbye to the cupcake ladies.

320
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,799
Nice to meet you.

321
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,671
Did that just happen or has my
fever suddenly spiked?

322
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,006
That's the first time I ever saw anyone

323
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,192
acting all pimp who still had pimples.

324
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:32,444
Yo, yo, yo!

325
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:34,011
And they're back.

326
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,814
What up, Shawties?

327
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,232
What's crackalackin?

328
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,984
Yo, today my boy became a mans.

329
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,018
That's right.

330
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,021
Got my bar mitzvah done, son.

331
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,573
Preach!

332
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,024
So let's get to it.

333
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,044
How much of my mitzvah money
is it gonna take

334
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,628
for you to pop that top and serve me up

335
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,533
some super fine taytays?

336
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,719
Dude, there is not enough money in the--

337
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,304
how much are we talking?

338
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,722
Max!

339
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:03,758
Yo, don't get all jealous, vanilla cone.

340
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,178
How about you turn around and
make it pop for daddy?

341
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,230
How would you like it
if I told your mother

342
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:10,548
right on the other side of that door

343
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,517
how you boys were in here
disrespecting us?

344
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,054
How is you gonna say anything
with your mouth full?

345
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,190
Damn, son!

346
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,444
Come in here, ma.
This way.

347
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:25,180
Don't say anything to her.

348
00:14:25,182 --> 00:14:26,581
Let's just get our money
and get out of here.

349
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,782
Max, she should know.

350
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,901
You wanna ruin their day
and not get paid?

351
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,570
Just keep it to yourself for
five minutes and we're gone.

352
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,039
I want you to meet
my mother, Hinda Fagel.

353
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,676
Ma, this is Max who made
the kosher cupcakes.

354
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,261
And I'm Caroline.

355
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:42,013
What did the shicksa say?

356
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,349
She said her name is Caroline.

357
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,884
Who cares what her name is?

358
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,135
She looks like the people that

359
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:51,139
stole my grandmother's good hutch.

360
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,590
But look at this one.

361
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:57,979
It's like looking in a mirror.

362
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,564
Oy, she's got a fever.

363
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,118
Oh, Max, oh honey, you're burning up.

364
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,602
Oh, no way, I don't get sick.

365
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,787
I get sick.

366
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:06,771
You're sick.

367
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,490
You'll come, you'll lie down.

368
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,657
Oh, I'm really fine.

369
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,942
We'll just get our money and head home.

370
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,744
Nonsense.
You'll see my husband.

371
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,212
The doctor.

372
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,663
Stop, wait, where are you taking her?

373
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,915
I'm the one who gets sick.

374
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,449
What did she say?

375
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,719
She says she wants your hutch.

376
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:28,986
You poor baby.

377
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:31,405
You have a fever of 102.

378
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:32,722
Just have to rest, Bubala.

379
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,191
I'm really fine.

380
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:36,660
That towel thing feels awesome.

381
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:39,229
It's a cold compress,
it'll bring your fever down.

382
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,398
My husband should be in any minute.

383
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,066
Thanks.

384
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,901
I think it's only right to tell you,

385
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,571
I don't know a lot about my
background, so...

386
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,571
I might not be Jewish.

387
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,074
Please, look at you.

388
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,260
You could be my daughter.

389
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,078
I would have liked that.

390
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,047
Always wanted a daughter.

391
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:59,716
I always wanted a mother.

392
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:01,084
Oh, did your mother die young?

393
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,270
Sadly, no.

394
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:07,107
Ooh, you need a kiss.

395
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,260
Oh, good your soup is ready.

396
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,813
Ess a bissel, tatelleh.

397
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:13,814
Bissel?

398
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:14,865
I know bissel.

399
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,766
Of course you do.
You're Jewish.

400
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,453
Okay, I'm Jewish, what the hell.

401
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,537
Oh, we don't believe in hell.

402
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,105
We don't?

403
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,574
Awesome.

404
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:27,711
Oh, thanks.

405
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:30,714
Call me Bubby.

406
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:32,165
Thanks, Bubby.

407
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,084
No one's ever blown on my soup before.

408
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:37,304
What's wrong with them?

409
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:42,893
♪ That's my boy,
that's my boy, hey, ho ♪

410
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:45,929
Oh, there he go!

411
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:48,682
That's what's up, hooker.

412
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:51,852
First of all, you just scuffed
his mother's freshly-waxed floor

413
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:54,354
and secondly, you may think
throwing away your family

414
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:57,691
traditions is cool now, but in
life, bad things can happen.

415
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:00,193
And one day, when you find
yourself penniless and sick,

416
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:01,778
you'll need your nice Jewish family

417
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,780
and you'll call them three times
and they won't answer the phone

418
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:06,450
no matter how much you need antibiotics.

419
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:11,032
Damn, boo, I stopped listening
after you said freshly-waxed.

420
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:15,258
Playa!

421
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:20,347
Max, I'm giving you some amoxicillin

422
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,448
for you to take home.

423
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,383
Now take it all, even when you

424
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,518
start feeling better.

425
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,853
Yes, Dr. Anshell.

426
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,605
Look what I brought.

427
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:30,057
Sweets for the sweets.

428
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,441
Ooh.

429
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:33,393
Uh, wait, wait, wait,
before you eat those,

430
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:35,178
remember how I said
I might not be Jewish?

431
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,314
- Yes.
- Those might not be kosher.

432
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:40,016
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying they're not kosher.

433
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,535
What is she saying?

434
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:42,685
Not kosher!

435
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,687
- What?
- Not kosher!

436
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,655
Spit it out, ma!

437
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:47,491
Spit it out!

438
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:52,028
Just a minute, it tastes so good.

439
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,213
- You like that?
- Stop.

440
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:54,381
- You like that?
- Stop it.

441
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:56,149
- You like that?
- S--that's it!

442
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:58,468
Listen, hit me with
one more dead president

443
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,703
and you'll be six feet under
with Biggie and Tupac.

444
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,140
You understand me, Jew-Tang Clan?

445
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:06,042
Skinny bitch came to play!

446
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,513
What kind of girl brings
non-kosher cupcakes

447
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:10,680
into a kosher home?

448
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:12,766
Not me-- I'm not that kind of girl.

449
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:15,218
Yeah, hi, I think I'm that kind of girl.

450
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,603
Max, what are you talking about?

451
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,605
I made sure every single one of those

452
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,157
was up to a rabbi's high standard.

453
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,059
Yes, well, maybe my rabbi
didn't have such high standards.

454
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,246
I'm so sorry, I burned some
and we were running late

455
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:29,116
and I figured,
four non-kosher out of 80.

456
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:30,367
So close.

457
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:32,169
Max, I told you how important

458
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:34,504
all those traditions are
to a Jewish family.

459
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,406
Yes, you told me about
tradition and family,

460
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:40,293
but none of that meant anything
until I felt that cold compress.

461
00:18:40,295 --> 00:18:42,262
And she was nice enough
to put it on my head

462
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:44,347
and I felt what that feels like.

463
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:46,016
And then Bubby blew on my soup

464
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:48,084
before she ate the non-kosher cupcake.

465
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:52,439
Wait, Bubby ate a non-kosher cupcake?

466
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,558
It's a shanda!

467
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,725
It is a shanda.

468
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,394
I'm hoping shanda means

469
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,429
you're forgiven and
we'll pay you anyway.

470
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,780
We are not taking any money.

471
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:03,766
That's right, you're not
taking anything.

472
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,620
Except for this compress.

473
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:09,072
Feel better.

474
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:10,957
Now go, get out of my sight.

475
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,564
And don't wear short skirts.

476
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,992
Esther Rachel,

477
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,378
I wanna talk to you about your son

478
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,580
Shmuley's behavior today.

479
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:17,764
What are you talking about?

480
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:18,815
What did my Shmuley do?

481
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:20,383
I'll tell you what he did.

482
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:22,052
He became a man.

483
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:23,170
That's all he did.

484
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:24,387
Right, Caroline?

485
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:25,839
I'll say he became a man.

486
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:27,140
What are you talking about?

487
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:28,124
Shmuley!

488
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,176
Stay out of it,

489
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:30,460
this is not our family.

490
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,811
You and I don't have a family.

491
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:32,795
They still do.

492
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,681
Let the police tell her about him.

493
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:36,733
So about my Shmuley.

494
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:37,984
What do you have to say?

495
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:43,156
Mazel tov, he's a wonderful,
wonderful boy.

496
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:44,991
Oh, there you are.

497
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:48,645
Shmuley, David, say goodbye to
the cupcake girls.

498
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,814
Nice to meet you.

499
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:54,799
Thank you.

500
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:56,536
So I see no Max.

501
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:58,004
She still out sick?

502
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,122
It's her first night back.

503
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:00,290
She should be here any minute.

504
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,374
Did you wanna order something

505
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:02,592
or wait for your boyfriend?

506
00:20:02,594 --> 00:20:07,764
Oh, see, this is sad story.

507
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:12,469
Uh, he broke off with me
to date other woman.

508
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:15,672
And she had penis.

509
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:25,332
Yeah, I can't compete with that.

510
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,366
Hi, Earl.

511
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:28,451
There she is, my long lost love.

512
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:29,486
How you feeling, Max?

513
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:31,821
I'm pretty good.

514
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,189
Hey, Bubby.

515
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,324
I brought you some chicken soup

516
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,076
for taking care of me
the last couple days.

517
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:38,161
I enjoyed being your Bubby.

518
00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:40,797
I guess you were wrong, Max.
You and I do have family--

519
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,864
each other.

520
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,199
We're not family until we have

521
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:46,419
to testify against each other
in a manslaughter trial.

522
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:50,039
Here, eat this.

523
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,641
I don't want you to
catch what I just had.

524
00:20:51,643 --> 00:20:52,809
Not gonna happen, Max.

525
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:53,876
I took your advice.

526
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:54,877
I manned up.

527
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,479
I stared germs in the face.

528
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:59,266
That's right, when you got sick,
I got balls.

529
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:00,433
Booyah!

530
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:05,689
Like looking in a mirror.
