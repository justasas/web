00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,582
Okay, everyone

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,882
time to divvy up
what's in the Lost & Found box.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,682
If my dignity's in there,
tell it I say "What up."

4
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:11,467
This is my favorite
day of the month.

5
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:14,367
Oh, God, I've fallen
so far so fast.

6
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,282
You haven't fallen that far.

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,582
First item--
A scrunchie.

8
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,118
I need that.
Give me!

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,887
I think I hit my bottom.

10
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:25,555
Okay, next item.

11
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:26,957
A pregnancy test.

12
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,259
That's empty.
What?

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,462
I had two free minutes,
and you never know.

14
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:34,631
Can we move this along?

15
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:37,901
I'm an old man,
and I need to get to bed.

16
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:40,403
You are late to meet woman
for hot date.

17
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:42,773
You know it.

18
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:45,942
A wallet and...

19
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:48,845
No money.

20
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:50,514
What?
If I was pregnant,

21
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,118
I needed it for the baby.

22
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,522
And finally
for the sixth month in a row...

23
00:00:58,523 --> 00:00:59,923
The wig.

24
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:03,293

a picture in it,

you have to take
a picture in it.

00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:11,668
Okay, fine.

The new <i>Martha Stewart Living.</i>

40
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,790
I ran so fast,
the librarian said,

41
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,825
"Stop running in the library,"

Man, they are never gonna be
able to rent this place now.

152
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:15,287
I'm gonna go over to my store
and put blood on the walls

153
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,190
so Max will like it more.

154
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,292
Max, look around.

155
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,727
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

156
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,629
Yup.
The shooter stood here,

157
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,863
and, based
on the blood splatter,

158
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,732
he was short
and walked with a limp.

159
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,001
And his name was Mad Dog.

160
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,036
'Cause I want that
to be his name.

161
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,306
No, Max, you know how we've
always wanted our own shop?

162
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:35,674
This is it.

163
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,977
This is Max's homemade cupcakes.

164
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,579
Oh.
Yeah, I see that.

165
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,181
And we can put our red velvets
over there

166
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:45,417
by the random skull fragments.

167
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:48,103
Besides, I thought our shop
was gonna be in Manhattan.

168
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:49,338
Manhattan's over.

169
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,506
Williamsburg
is the new hot area,

170
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:54,810
and besides Martha's blurb says
we're a Williamsburg must-have,

171
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:56,678
so we must have this space.

172
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,815
No, we must have the money.

173
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:02,818
I mean, this place has got
to be, like, $4,000 a month.

174
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,120
Was.
Was $4,000 a month.

175
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,324
That was the pre-tragedy price.

176
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,828
When people die,
it's a buyer's market.

177
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:15,597
You want to rent a room
in that <i>Shining</i> hotel now,

178
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,599
it's, like, 50 bucks a night.

179
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,035
Well, obviously
I wanna start a business

180
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:22,337
in a place where there
was a shooting spree.

181
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:25,774
And, if we go with red,
it's half painted.

182
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,643
But where are we
gonna get the money?

183
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,978
This blurb is our money
in the bank.

184
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,780
Oh, yeah, that's another thing
we don't have.

185
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:33,048
A bank.

186
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:35,050
There are places
set up by women

187
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:37,653
specifically to support
other women's small businesses.

188
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:40,856
I'm talking
girl-on-girl financing.

189
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:43,458
That's hot.

190
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,394
But I don't care
how much money they offer us.

191
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,963
I'm not braiding anyone's hair.

192
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,331
But are we ready?

193
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:51,300
Okay, yes.

194
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:53,669
This is a big leap of faith,
but we're getting in

195
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,370
lots of orders now
thanks to the blurb.

196
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,639
And what's the worst thing
that could happen?

197
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,043
Um, maybe these
could be our brains.

198
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,011
No, not gonna happen.

199
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,079
We're gonna kill it.

200
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,881
No disrespect to any spirits

201
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:08,517
still trying to find
their way into the light.

202
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:09,851
I'll figure out a place,
and we'll go

203
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:11,486
first thing in the morning.

204
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:13,388
Find something business-y
to wear, less cleavage.

205
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,325
Oh, these are all business.

206
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:18,860
Great, I'm gonna go find Andy.

207
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:22,931
What is it about real estate
that makes you wanna dry hump?

208
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,702
Max, I'm so excited.

209
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,170
We're getting our dream.

210
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,038
You look like you want a hug.

211
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,508
I do.

212
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:40,450
Good night.

213
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:50,094
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes,"

214
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,048
you're up.

215
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,800
Caroline,
why didn't you pick up?

216
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,435
They just called us early,
and I don't know

217
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,053
what to write on the paper.

218
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,439
And I feel like an idiot,
my boobs are suffocating,

219
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,592
and the only "business" thing
I could find was Han's blazer.

220
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:07,195
It's itchy, and there's
a piece of paper in the pocket

221
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:08,262
with his name on it.

222
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:09,780
Why would he have that?

223
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,900
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes,"

224
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,202
time is money.

225
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,820
Um, here.

226
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,372
But our appointment's
not for another 20 minutes.

227
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,042
Have a seat.

228
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:22,776
Cool place.

229
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:24,945
Women's small businesses.

230
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:26,881
Sisters doing it for themselves.

231
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:28,799
[Chuckling]
Well, I'm doing it

232
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,252
for the medical benefits.

233
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:33,554
- Go.
- Oh, now?

234
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:35,756
Before she gets here?

235
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,309
Um, well, I'm not really much
of a business person.

236
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,563
Great way to start
a business loan application.

237
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:43,964
Go!

238
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,169
You have a minute.

239
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,658
Okay, well, um,
how much time do I have now?

240
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,027
Slightly less than a minute.

241
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,447
Okay, uh, my business partner

242
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,449
could explain this
better than me, but I'll try.

243
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,167
[Clears throat]

244
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,419
[Almost inaudible]
We have a cupcake business.

245
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:09,457
And we bake cupcakes
in my roommate's bedroom.

246
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:11,792
I can't hear you.

247
00:10:12,294 --> 00:10:15,346
You want to write it down,
draw it, shape it in clay?

248
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,099
I would have
filled this out more,

249
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,268
but that chick over there
wouldn't let me cheat off her.

250
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,503
She's not a girl's girl,
know what I mean?

251
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,356
Very professional.

252
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,608
Under past loan repayment,

253
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,529
you put, "Paid Todd back
all the beer money I owed."

254
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,365
To be fair,
he was drunk all the time.

255
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,733
I could have just said I did.

256
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,068
Points for honesty.

257
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,871
Let's get you
a new loan application.

258
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,356
Just got your message.

259
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,191
The one time I don't come early.

260
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:48,796
Speaking of that, I just had
the most amazing orgasm.

261
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,414
I mean, we've been having
really great sex,

262
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,801
but this morning,
I could not get enough of his--

263
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:57,705
projected growth ratio
investment analysis.

264
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:59,006
Hello, Caroline Channing.

265
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:00,391
Wharton class of '09.

266
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,810
That's our business proposal.

267
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,211
And I would be
a little embarrassed

268
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,730
about what just happened
if I didn't know

269
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,214
that we're all just girls here.

270
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,100
Can we move this along?

271
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,436
I got a busted toilet
and a pregnant dog at home.

272
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:16,774
Why didn't you tell me
she was under there?

273
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,943
Oh, sorry,
I wasn't expecting a monologue

274
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,162
from
<i>Confessions of a Call Girl.</i>

275
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,998
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to deny the loan.

276
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,917
Why? Because she had
a good orgasm?

277
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,171
Isn't that what the '70s
was about for you gals?

278
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,423
You have no business history.

279
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,175
And that's a requirement for us.

280
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:36,594
Well, I think we're done here.

281
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,046
Yeah.
I just said that.

282
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,414
I thought you guys were

283
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,600
about supporting
small women's business.

284
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,419
And this small woman's
"bidness" needs support

285
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,722
after the pounding
it took today.

286
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,974
Max, let's go.

287
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,430
Okay, there's a bank
in New Hampshire

288
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,766
that doesn't check anything.

289
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,435
And before someone else
grabs our cupcake space,

290
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,987
I say we get on a bus
and go up there.

291
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,739
They won't give out
their exact address,

292
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:06,741
but I know they're in
a mini mall with a white castle.

293
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:08,108
Better idea.

294
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,578
I went to Craigslist,

295
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,164
clicked on "etc" and found

296
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,633
all kinds of opportunities
to make some cash.

297
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,252
I'm fighting the instinct
to weep, but keep going.

298
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:20,788
At first I thought
I might call pit pig.

299
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,306
He just wants
his armpits smelled,

300
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,641
but that's, like, 1,000 sniffs.

301
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,509
Big commitment.

302
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,679
Or there's the weirdo
looking for pretty amputees,

303
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,231
but that feels
like a bigger commitment.

304
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,566
So, check it.

305
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,768
"Egg donors needed.

306
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,086
Ten to twenty grand."

307
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,521
No way,
I could never sell my eggs.

308
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,823
I mean, wouldn't you
hate to think

309
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,241
you had a kid out there
and not know it?

310
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:41,611
I probably do.

311
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:47,331
In 2006, I invented the Four Loko
and Robitussin smoothie.

312
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,999
It's pretty much
a blackout year.

313
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,786
Seriously, for the right price
I'd sell 'em all.

314
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,154
Really?

315
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:55,222
I mean,
I know you've always been tough.

316
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:56,490
To hear you tell it,
you were part

317
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,159
of an underground
baby fight club.

318
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:00,177
But don't you wanna be
a mom some day?

319
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,995
In the history of the world,

320
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:04,164
give me one example
of a really good mother.

321
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,966
You're putting me on the spot.

322
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,052
All I can think of
is Hilary Duff.

323
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,388
Look, you're complicating this

324
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,390
with these things
you call emotions.

325
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,841
Like it or not...

326
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:15,843
[Bawks like a chicken]

327
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,012
I'm an egg farm.

328
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,781
Because we don't know one single
person outside of New Hampshire

329
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:22,283
who can lend us
that kind of money.

330
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:26,620
Yoo-hoo, girls,
look out the window.

331
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,692
Up here!
It's me!

332
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:36,163
Oleg and I would like
two cupcakes please.

333
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,916
I feel weird
asking Sophie for money.

334
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,584
And how do we
even know she has any?

335
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,586
Well, she's building
her dream house in Poland

336
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,538
between a former death camp
and a new W.

337
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,424
She's gotta be loaded.

338
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,592
And Sophie's the kind of woman
who understands our dreams.

339
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,812
Come in.

340
00:13:56,184 --> 00:13:58,185
That's exactly
what I thought would be

341
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,520
on the other side of that door.

342
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:02,406
Oleg, sweetie,
we have company.

343
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,825
I brought you an ass pillow.

344
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:08,946
Nice to see you like this
outside of work, girls, no?

345
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:13,066
Both: No.

346
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:17,955
Girls, did you see
my big hanging thing?

347
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,674
Yeah, we kinda just saw it.

348
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:25,412
No, I'm talking about my new
ch-andelier for my lake house.

349
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:29,082
Yeah, I can totally see you
drinking ch-ardonnay under it.

350
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,769
Oh, Max, you are so funny.

351
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,654
She's a real ch-aracter.

352
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,140
Yeah, that's not a word.

353
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,325
Okay, well,
we just wanted to bring you

354
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,694
some more cupcakes
for free, per usual,

355
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,764
and perhaps talk about
a possible business venture.

356
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,933
Oh, sorry, girls.

357
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,101
I have two rules in life:

358
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:51,772
Never drink
from the same well as a gypsy

359
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:55,292
and never lend money
to friends.

360
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,328
And, Max, you are my friend.

361
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,214
Okay, well, we were just
checking, but thanks anyway.

362
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,465
But, Sophie,
just hear us out.

363
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,116
It's a wonderful opportunity,

364
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:04,635
and we'll of course
pay you back with interest.

365
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,554
Okay, buh-bye.

366
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:11,425
Let's go. We tried it.
Now it's--[Clucks]--time.

367
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,127
You are not harvesting
your body for money.

368
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:15,763
What's the big deal?

369
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:19,099
I sold two kidneys
for a down payment on my house.

370
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:21,602
Not true.
You need at least one to live.

371
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:25,990
Oh, well,
they weren't mine.

372
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,609
Well, you know
what we have to do.

373
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:30,995
Let's get the bawk
out of here.

374
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,510
And you're sure you're okay
with selling your eggs, right?

375
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:42,613
Totally. What do I care?
I've got a million of 'em.

376
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:44,981
I'm happy to lose a few.
More room for beer.

377
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:47,033
Lose some eggs,
more room for beer.

378
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:49,051
It's crazy
that's not their slogan.

379
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:51,137
So what'd they ask you
on the application?

380
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,838
You know, income, hobbies,

381
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,473
"Did you ever
have sex in Africa?"

382
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,976
[Scoffs]
I wish.

383
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:58,811
The closest I ever got
was a dude once

384
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:01,781
put his hand up my skirt
in an Ethiopian restaurant.

385
00:16:01,783 --> 00:16:03,699
You know, now that we're here,

386
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:06,068
I think it's kind of wonderful
that places like this exist

387
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,621
to help women who can't have
babies have babies.

388
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:11,292
Hey, you think they
take points off for syphilis?

389
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:15,878
Max, I think it's really noble

390
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,630
what you're doing
to get our dream.

391
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:19,165
This is a very special day.

392
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,867
How do you spell "chlamydia"?

393
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:24,203
Well, no "k" s,

394
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:26,972
and I personally
wouldn't heart the "I".

395
00:16:26,974 --> 00:16:28,674
Oh, thanks.

396
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:31,560
And do I gotta put here
if my brother touched a kid?

397
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:33,312
Max Black.

398
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:34,880
Thank you for your interest,

399
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:36,348
but I'm afraid we're
gonna have to pass.

400
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,684
Why?
I didn't have sex in Africa.

401
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:41,403
Yes, I know,
that was your one plus,

402
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:42,938
but under "family history",

403
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,658
you put "drinking"
and "secrets".

404
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,743
I was being honest.

405
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:51,113
Yeah, maybe too honest,
because under "education"

406
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:53,232
you wrote, <i>"Jeopardy</i> reruns",

407
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:55,668
and we're really
looking for college graduates.

408
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,738
Jeez, I'll take "elitist"
for 500, Alex.

409
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,674
Sorry, we're looking for girls

410
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,509
that come
from Ivy league schools

411
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,845
and have impressive
family backgrounds.

412
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:07,913
Maybe her eggs
didn't go to Wharton

413
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,082
and graduate at the top
of their class like I did,

414
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:11,750
but just look at her.

415
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:14,720
Who wouldn't want a baby
with such strength, beauty,

416
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:18,090
and a rack so great
it could breast-feed itself?

417
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:20,109
You went to Wharton?

418
00:17:20,111 --> 00:17:23,313
We pay $20,000
for Ivy league eggs.

419
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:28,400
[Clucks]

420
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:30,569
Wow, we're
taking blood already?

421
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:33,906
I guess going to Wharton
does put you on the fast track.

422
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:36,125
Just part of the process
to become a donor.

423
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:38,010
I'm gonna go get some vials,
and I'll be right back.

424
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:40,963
It's so cool of you
to do this.

425
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:42,164
It says a lot about you.

426
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,632
You know what says
a lot about me?

427
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:45,217
The fact that I know
she tied you off wrong.

428
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,303
I'm happy to do it.

429
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:50,973
It's a small price to pay
to make our dream come true.

430
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:53,008
I'm doin' this
to pay down some debt.

431
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,811
I'm real deep
'cause of Powerball.

432
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,897
Whoa, dude,
how did you get through?

433
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:02,101
I went to Harvard.
I'm like crazy-good at math.

434
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:04,486
Max, she's making me nervous.
Close the curtain.

435
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:06,305
And frankly,
I'm a little resentful.

436
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:07,990
I didn't get into Harvard.

437
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:09,808
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

438
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,660
- 'Cause you seem a little jumpy.
- No, I'm fine.

439
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:13,279
They're just taking
a little blood.

440
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:14,646
Or from the looks of it,

441
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:16,198
they're taking all of it.

442
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,450
There better be a nice juice
and a cookie after this.

443
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:22,087
Please relax.
It's only eight vials.

444
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:24,823
They gotta take a lot to
make sure they don't get a kid

445
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:27,110
with, like, another kid
growing out of it.

446
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:30,129
Max, this all
just got very real.

447
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:32,548
- Hold my hand.
- You know I don't hold hands.

448
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,801
Oh, you lesbians
are so high maintenance.

449
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:37,469
Please?

450
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,887
You don't think
I'm gonna give away

451
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:40,356
my best egg, right?

452
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:42,191
I'm not gonna give away
the concert pianist

453
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:43,859
and get stuck with the guy
who breaks into homes

454
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,477
and smells women's underwear?

455
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:48,180
Well, either way,
you got a kid with a passion.

456
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:49,681
But you don't have to do this.

457
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,734
No, I can do this.
It's for our dream.

458
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:53,018
But you don't have to do this.

459
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,253
I can do this.
Put it in.

460
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:55,520
It's already in.

461
00:18:55,522 --> 00:18:57,222
I can't do this.

462
00:18:57,224 --> 00:19:00,292
I'm not trashy,
I'm not some farm animal.

463
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:02,378
Oh! Oh, my God!

464
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,549
Oh, my God.

465
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:10,135
I am so, so sorry!

466
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:11,870
You know
what would be cute here?

467
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:13,922
A cupcake store.

468
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:22,548
Hi, Max.
Oh, it's chilly outside.

469
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,218
Nipples everywhere.

470
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,987
Have a seat.
I'll be right over.

471
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:31,774
Oh, that's okay.
I texted my order in on the way.

472
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:35,744
Hey, baby. I got your text.
Did you get my erotic haiku?

473
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:37,396
I did.

474
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:39,898
Did you get the picture I sent
of me and the dustbuster?

475
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,369
No, I didn't.

476
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:47,623
Oh, no, Grandpa Yorgish!

477
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:49,908
Look.

478
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,343
Earl framed our blurb.

479
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:55,914
- He did? That is so sweet.
- What?

480
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,751
I always saw it as bigger
on the wall in our shop.

481
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:02,554
Look, the shop
is an amazing idea,

482
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:03,972
and, if it's not
that space right now,

483
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:05,224
it'll be another.

484
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:06,642
I mean, there have to be
mass murders

485
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:08,260
all over Brooklyn, right?

486
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:10,863
If we're lucky.

487
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:12,698
And, even
if it didn't work out,

488
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,450
it's still the closest
I've ever come

489
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:16,601
to something great,
and that's cool.

490
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:20,289
And someday we'll find someone
crazy enough to lend us money.

491
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,658
I say that because, if you can
convince me to believe a dream,

492
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,659
you can get anyone.

493
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,661
Pickup.
[Rings bell]

494
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:28,914
Here you go, Sophie.
That's $11.25.

495
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,517
Oh, you take a check, right?

496
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,219
This is for $20,000.

497
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:37,673
Oh, is it?
I thought it was for $20.

498
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,559
Oh, well. Keep it.

499
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:43,395
Maybe you could use it
for your dream,

500
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:46,315
or to get your legs waxed,
or something.

501
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:49,101
- Sophie, are you serious?
- Yes.

502
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:51,653
Sophie, this is really,
really amazing.

503
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:54,573
Oh, come on.
I don't need a parade.

504
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,859
Just keep the cupcakes coming.

505
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:01,697
Max, do you know
what this means?

506
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:04,649
We are going to be
a Williamsburg must-have.

507
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:06,752
We're getting our dream.

508
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:08,871
I feel like you want a hug.

509
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:11,673
I do.
