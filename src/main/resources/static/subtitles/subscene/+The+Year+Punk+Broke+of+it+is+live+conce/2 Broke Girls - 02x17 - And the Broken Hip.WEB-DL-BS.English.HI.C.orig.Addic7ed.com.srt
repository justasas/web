We're being sued.

172
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,702
Okay, let me see those.

173
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,004
I studied law in Korea,

174
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:55,905
but I never made it
through graduation.

175
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:57,791
I realized
it wasn't my passion,

176
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:00,760
and I pulled out.

177
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,248
Did they know it was in?

178
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,583
Let's see... Uh-huh...
Uh-huh.

179
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:11,304
Yeah, you're being sued.

180
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:14,639
What law school did you go to,
Cal State-the-obvious?

181
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:18,777
Did you graduate
magna come rarely?

182
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,614
I told you, I pulled out.

183
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,953
But don't worry,
accidents like this happen

184
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:28,405
in stores all the time.

185
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,874
That's why all businesses
have insurance.

186
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:34,209
Well, not all businesses.

187
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:37,280
How could you not
have insurance?

188
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:39,115
You need to get protection.

189
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:42,450
And I'm not talking
about condoms.

190
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:44,387
We're not idiots, Han.

191
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:45,722
We had
the insurance discussion.

192
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:47,290
I was like,
"Max, we need insurance."

193
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,641
And she was like,
"Do we have any money?"

194
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:50,143
And I was like, "No."
And she was like,

195
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,428
"What are the chances
something will happen?"

196
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,398
And I was like, "A million to one."
And she was like, "I like those odds.

197
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,982
Let's go get gummi bears."
And I was like, "Okay."

198
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:57,400
But we'll talk about this
at another time."

199
00:09:57,402 --> 00:10:00,735
And here we are
talking about it now.

200
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:04,357
Remember, we have no choice.

201
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:07,077
We have to get him
to drop this lawsuit.

202
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:09,579
Okay, 3B, here. This is
the puppet guy's apartment.

203
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,948
You say puppet guy,
I say serial killer.

204
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,250
You say apartment,
I say the brightest dot

205
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,202
on the "Megan's law" website.

206
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:18,671
Max, that is not charming.
Stay on message.

207
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:22,006
- We're charming, we're sorry...
- We're drunk. Well, I am.

208
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:25,328
How else do you think I'm gonna
pull off charming?

209
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,379
Let's just get in and out
of there.

210
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,680
That puppet creeped me out.

211
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:29,515
I don't want to have
to see it again.

212
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:37,607
Oh, I am not drunk enough
for this.

213
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:40,110
I've never been
drunk enough for this.

214
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:43,029
Is J. Petto home?

215
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:51,071
I'm kind of surprised.

216
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:53,373
I did not think
he'd have a girlfriend.

217
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,076
Hello.

218
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,411
Well, I hope you enjoyed
meeting Yvette.

219
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:01,631
She plays the lute, you know.

220
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,966
Oh, yes,
she was very charming.

221
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:08,254
And small. She must make
your penis look huge.

222
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:11,589
I'm sorry?

223
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:14,260
Charming, Max, charming.

224
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:16,980
Hi, we just stopped by
to bring you some cupcakes.

225
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:18,881
We feel so bad
about what happened.

226
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,383
Can we come in for a minute?

227
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:23,269
Um, well, I wasn't
expecting company,

228
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,355
but come in.

229
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:27,107
We're all just hangin' out.

230
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:31,442
Oh, oh, this isn't weird.
This isn't weird at all.

231
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:35,547
It's like we're
in a dead body car wash.

232
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,083
I had a nightmare that I had
a nightmare like this once.

233
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,422
Just so you know,

234
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:45,375
I'm not allowed to talk
about the lawsuit.

235
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:46,793
Well, I'm not allowed to talk

236
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:49,546
about how I really feel
right now.

237
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,965
Speaking of the lawsuit,
you seem well--

238
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:53,800
you know, physically--
which is great,

239
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,585
because the suit said
you had a shattered arm

240
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:57,187
and a broken hip.

241
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:59,272
Oh, yeah, I'm not suing you

242
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:01,474
for <i>my</i> shattered arm and hip.

243
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:04,809
It's--
it's for Pierre's.

244
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,936
I crushed his little body
when I fell.

245
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:16,439
He must have thrown himself
under my body

246
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:19,774
to protect my fall.

247
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:23,611
Dexter, party of one.

248
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:28,135
I have to rotate his arm
and hold it every 15 minutes

249
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:30,119
to get his full range
of motion back.

250
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:33,454
That's what the sling's about.
I know he's not alive.

251
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:37,509
Do you?

252
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:40,396
We're very sorry
for his injury,

253
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:41,814
but this is absurd.

254
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,983
You can't sue us
because your puppet broke.

255
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:46,969
Yes, I can.
This puppet is my livelihood,

256
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:48,605
and he's heavily insured.

257
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:51,157
Great, the puppet has
insurance, and we don't.

258
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,808
- Max!
- What?

259
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,227
You don't have insurance?

260
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:56,529
You have a business
but no insurance?

261
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:59,864
Look, we can't go to court.
It would wreck us.

262
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,751
Can we leave the lawyers
out of this

263
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:03,586
and come up
with a more creative solution?

264
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:05,038
I mean,
you're clearly creative.

265
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,790
Look, you even made
a skeleton king.

266
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:09,492
That's not a skeleton king.

267
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:12,595
That's Pazuzu,
prince of darkness.

268
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,131
Let me just put this out there

269
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,166
because we should really
move things along,

270
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:19,552
and also, I'm afraid.

271
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:21,721
How much is it gonna take
to make this go away?

272
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:23,306
Do you want to take
a second to consult

273
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:24,390
with one of your roommates?

274
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:26,859
I think I saw a lawyer doll.

275
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:30,194
He is not a lawyer.
He is a maitre d'.

276
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:33,848
And a damn good one!

277
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:36,069
You women just don't get it.

278
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,021
This is why I broke up
with my Toronto-based girlfriend

279
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:40,907
over Skype.

280
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:43,626
Right?

281
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,629
$1,000 by Monday.

282
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,331
But if she makes
another comment

283
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,666
about my intricate, hand-carved
marionettes being dolls...

284
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,803
[Whistles]
It goes up.

285
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:59,425
Fine, $1,000 and no strings.

286
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:02,760

Those are the things
I was holding in.

00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:20,745
Oh, wait--
Doll and Oates!

292
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:26,334
Now what? How are we gonna get
1,000 extra dollars by Monday?

293
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:29,038
Wait, Max, we can go
to that bar

294
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,790
and exploit
your special gifts.

295
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:34,125
If I have to strip,
I have to strip.

296
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:37,547
Not that kind of bar,
the hipster trivia bar.

297
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,015
Can't I just strip?

298
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,300
At least I'd still have
my dignity.

299
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:47,864
It's all here. $1,000.

300
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:50,867
So that's it.
No more lawsuit.

301
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:52,318
Actually, that's not it.

302
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,454
As it turns out,
we're gonna need 500 more.

303
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:57,407
For what? Did your dues
for the serial killer's union

304
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:00,742
and the pedophile guild come up
at the same time this year?

305
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:04,297
Pierre's in crisis!

306
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:07,632
But his psychiatrist could
tell you more about that.

307
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:10,386
If there's a psychiatrist
in this apartment

308
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:13,721
who hasn't locked him up,
I don't trust his opinion.

[In old man voice]
I'm Dr. Pangloss.

Pierre broke more than his hip
in your cupcake shop.

311
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,933
He broke his spirit.

312
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:29,487
He lost his <i>dream!</i>

313
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:33,357
He no longer wants to perform.

314
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:40,416
This is where he cuts us in half
and sews my top to your bottom.

315
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,169
On the plus side,
we'd look amazing.

[Normal voice]
Yeah, well, you heard it.

317
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:47,239
Pierre's ready
to give up his art,

318
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:49,508
and he needs
a little more money.

319
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,128
Forget it, puppet nuts.
We don't have $500.

320
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,130
We don't have 500 anything.

321
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:56,432
Well, think about it.

Uhh! I'll do it.

324
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:04,055
I'm not so sure the hostility
is quite working,

325
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:05,691
so why don't you
go wait in the hall?

326
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:07,526
And I'll try to talk
some sense into him alone.

327
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:09,395
You are the only person
in the world

328
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:11,198
who would insist
on being alone with this man,

329

but okay.

330
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:16,268
Please just listen.
We are broke.

331
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,371
To get any more money,
we'd have to strip.

332
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:21,657
Well, Gigi and Lana
started off as strippers,

333
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,992
and now they're
in the Folies Bergere, so...

334

You know, even
for a middle-aged puppeteer,

335
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,782
you're a freak.

336
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:33,117
See you in court!

337
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:36,005
Nothing.
He's gonna sue us,

338

up our sleeve.

00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:57,076
I'm sorry,
we're not open today.

342
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:00,411
I know you took him.
Give me back Pierre!

343
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,248
We're not open.

344
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,083
We've had a terrible tragedy.

345
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:06,202
Well, not us,
but a new friend of ours

346
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:09,537
had a gruesome accident,
and we are just devastated.

347
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:12,341
You wouldn't be that cruel.

348
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:14,794
Relax, I could never be
that cruel.

349
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:15,795
But Max could.

350
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:19,130
Well, well, well.

351
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:24,551
Look who it is, Pierre,
your lover, J. Petto!

352
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:28,939
He's not gay.

353
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,009
He had a girlfriend
named Lulu.

354
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,863
She was a--she was a courtesan
in the court of a French king.

355
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:35,948
They broke up
over a brief flirtation she had

356
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,950
with Yvette.

357
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:41,253
And I know they're not alive!

358
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:44,588
Now, what do you say we stick
to the original no-strings deal?

359
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,992
'Cause if you don't,
Max will show you

360
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:50,327
what "no strings"
really means.

361
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:52,631
Do it! Go!
Bring it!

362
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,966
I can always re-string him.
I'm a master of my craft.

363
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:59,388
Yes, we thought
you'd say that.

364
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,474
So you leave us no choice.
Max...

365
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:03,626
What? I--

366
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:05,394
I'm not changing my mind.

367
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:08,729
And I'm coming back
with the police.

368
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:12,735
Oh, I wouldn't get
the cops involved...

369
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:14,687
Now that your boy here
is in a...

370
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:18,022
Compromising situation!

371
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,673
How dare you!

372
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:40,211
And she does not like
the feel of a condom!

373
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:45,468
You two are sick!

374
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,304
Hey, we don't judge.

375
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:50,606
We think whatever
two consenting dolls,

376
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:53,941
or maybe <i>three</i>
consenting dolls do--

377
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:56,779
and it's gonna be bad

378
00:18:56,781 --> 00:19:00,114
'cause he's a grower,
not a shower.

379
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:08,157
And once a few of these pics
are posted online,

380
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,109
there goes your children's
party business.

381
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:14,444
Now, call it quits,
and you can delete these pics.

382
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:17,333
Fine. Yes. Okay, you win.
You win. You win.

383
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:20,052
Oh, we're not falling
for your word again.

384
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,171
If you want
your doll back--

385
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:25,506
For the last time,
he is not a doll!

386
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:27,810
Bring us
a notarized letter saying

387
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:29,461
you release
Max's Homemade Cupcakes

388
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:31,230
of all further legal action,

389
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:33,566
and we'll give you back Pierre,
perfectly intact.

390
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:36,602
Minus his virginity,
of course.

391
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:39,937
But don't worry,
you'll still have yours.

392
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:44,193
Okay, I'll be back
as soon as I can.

393
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:47,528
Ugh, 30 years in
the cutthroat world of puppets,

394
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:51,165
and I'm undone
by two crazy cupcake bitches!

395
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,092
Did you hear that?
30 years?

396
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:03,427
30 years of following his dream,
and he's still broke?

397
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:04,880
Is that gonna be us, Max?

398
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:07,266
Is our dream just as stupid
as puppets?

399
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,718
Sorry, Pierre,
I forgot you were here.

400
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,336
He's sound asleep.

401
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:13,806
Three-ways really
take it out of you.

402
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:15,391
Here, dress her.
She has to get a cab.

403
00:20:15,393 --> 00:20:18,310
She'd rather sleep
in her own bed.

404
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:23,115
And do you know why we're
not gonna turn into him?

405
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:25,317
Because 30 years ago,
when J. Petto said,

406
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,869
"I'm gonna be a puppeteer,"

407
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:28,537
he didn't have a best friend
to tell him,

408
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:31,290
"You shouldn't do that.
It's a stupid idea."

409
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:33,025
And unlike him,
you have me to tell you

410
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:34,460
when it's a stupid idea.

411
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:36,295
And I have you to tell me
not to mace myself,

412
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:39,531
no matter how bad
I want to know how it feels.

413
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:42,051
So the cupcake shop
isn't a stupid idea?

414
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:44,219
No. And it's actually starting
to take off.

415
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:47,205
'Cause no one embraces
a stupid idea like a hipster.

416
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,642
But, Max,
we do need insurance.

417
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:51,360
- But do we have the money?
- No.

418
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,180
What are the chances
someone else is gonna fall?

419
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:54,397
A million to one.

420
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,649
I like those odds.

421
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:58,934
You know, this is
a really cute dress.

422
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:00,102
[Scoffs]
Forget the dress.

423
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:02,271
Look at his cute pants.

424
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:05,324
We really should give them
to Han.

425
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:09,074
