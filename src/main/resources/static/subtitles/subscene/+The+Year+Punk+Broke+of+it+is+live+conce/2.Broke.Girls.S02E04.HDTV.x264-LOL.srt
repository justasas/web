I'm a little in the weeds right now.

You mean you smoked a
little weed right now?

00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,343
It's medicinal.

about this cupcake thing?

167

ten days for a response.

Huh, caught you dreaming.

172
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:05,557
All right, so maybe I thought
about it for, like, a second,

when we first became a team.

174
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,777
But then I remembered
the world's a dead-end

175
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,362
and nothing good happens ever to anyone.

176

Oh, Max.

179
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:18,453
You finally called us a team.

180
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:20,122
We are so going on that show.

181
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:22,874
Seriously, I don't know
how Abby and Brittany do it,

182
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,042
because I'm uncomfortable with you

183
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,911
even sitting this close to me.

184
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:34,988
Well, if we're making an audition tape

185
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,190
to be on a reality show called,

186
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:37,975
"the world's most uncomfortable t-shirt,"

187
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:39,893
we have already won.

188
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:43,013
Yes, I could have gotten
us a more expensive shirt

189
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:44,932
at American Apparel, but then we would

190
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:47,067
just look like people
pretending to be poor.

191
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:51,105
And 13, and probably in the sex trade.

192
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:52,573
I cannot believe you used your flat iron

193
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,991
to put these letters on.

194
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:56,660
Well, I can't believe you
once used it to make a panini,

195
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:59,747
but... [scoffs] that's what happens now.

196
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:01,865
Where's the scissors?
I gotta give this thing

197
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,568
- some flave.
- Max, what are you doing?

198
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,455
Crew necks are for squares and mormons.

199
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:12,142
Oh, cute! Should we do mine?

200
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:13,594
I don't know.

201
00:08:13,596 --> 00:08:17,998
If you have no car, why open the garage?

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,467
[Laughter]

203
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:22,636
So, I thought we'd shoot it over here

204
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:25,889
in our adorable, scrappy,
low-income kitchen.

205
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,591
Why are you talking like that?

206
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:29,393
Because that's our brand.

207
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,978
<i>I've watched a ton of Cupcake Wars,</i>

208
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,146
and it's a lot about branding.

209
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:33,363
And what are we?

210
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:34,732
The girl who knows how to make cupcakes

211
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:36,817
and the girl who doesn't?

212
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,602
Max, I'm not worried about that.

213
00:08:38,604 --> 00:08:40,437
You'll just tell me what
to do, like you always do,

214
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:43,273
and we'll be the two
scrappy girls with so little

215
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:44,658
you can't help but love them.

216
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,910
I hate them already.

217
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:48,061
[Knock at door]

218
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:49,496
Okay, that's Oleg.

219
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,415
You did tell him he's
filming us for an audition

220
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,900
and not making a porno, right?

221
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:56,920
Yeah, I made it very clear.

222
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:59,956
Why are your tops still on?

223
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,508
And why isn't the plastic down?

224
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,877
You're gonna get oil everywhere.

225
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,730
Oleg, Max told you we're not
gonna make that kind of movie.

226
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:09,132
I know, but so did every
girl that I worked with

227
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:10,951
on "Backdoor Brides."

228
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,570
And then again on "Backdoor Brides Two."

229
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:17,691
But five minutes later, it
was "Here comes the bride."

230
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,443
Oh, good.

231
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:22,246
You still have your tops on.

232
00:09:22,248 --> 00:09:23,831
Yeah, they don't have to make

233
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,649
girl-on-girl porn film for money.

234
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,334
I got you big Duza Day party.

235
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:29,169
300 cupcakes!

236
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,505
Oh, my God! That's $1,200.

237
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:34,591
No, it's for free.

238
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:36,176
You do it for connections,

239
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:39,012
and for the hot and cold pierogi buffet.

240
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,547
Oh, Sophie, I don't know
if we should be taking

241
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:41,799
free work right now.

242
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:43,183
We're doing this TV
thing, and if we get it,

243
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,968
we don't know what our schedule will be.

244
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,257
Oh, I didn't know I was
talking to Cagney and Lacey.

245
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:53,060
Yeah, well, suit yourself.

246
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:54,561
We're sorry, Sophie.

247
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:57,097
You have every right to be mad.

248
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,316
Would a cupcake help?

249
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,535
Always.

250
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:05,322
Well, I just texted the
third girl not to come,

251
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:08,642
so let's get this over with.

252
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,711
This is so exciting. We're gonna be great.

253
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:12,846
- We got this, girl.
- Okay, stop.

254
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:15,415
On every reality show,
people say lame things

255
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,633
that we can never say.

256
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:18,635
No fist bumping. No high fives.

257
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:21,037
You can't tell me to
"bring it," "shut it down,"

258
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,006
or "put our cupcake business on the map."

259
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:25,709
You can't tell me to "go,
girl"" or "bring my 'a' game,"

260
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:27,477
and we don't "got this." Cool?

261
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,595
Cool.

262
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:32,850
- But we do got this, right?
- Yeah, we got this.

263
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:34,585
Okay, here we go, girls.

264
00:10:34,587 --> 00:10:39,189
Arch your backs. Sorry, force of habit.

265
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:40,274
Action.

266
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:41,942
Hey, what's up? I'm Max,

267
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:43,660
and this is my partner, Caroline.

268
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:45,696
And we're Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

269
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:50,234
And by homemade, I mean, "Ho!-Made."

270
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:52,870
[Laughs] You go, girl!

271
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,009
- We are an online bakery...
- Well, we have a website.

272
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:01,545
And we're based right here
in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

273
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:03,630
And this is where the magic happens.

274
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,383
This is our kitchen-slash-
living room-slash-my bedroom...

275
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:08,585
Slash my wrists, 'cause
I'm trying to bake all night

276
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:11,038
while she's sleeping over there.

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,223
And here is our purple stove.

278
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:14,424
Just because you're poor,

279
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,393
that doesn't mean you can't have style.

280
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,862
Or a horse that just came in unannounced.

281
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:20,647
Oh, this is Chestnut.

282
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,149
He's our test audience.

283
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:23,450
But we don't feed him chocolate.

284
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:25,118
'Cause that would kill him.

285
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,956
[Mouth full] They have a horse!

286
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,493
So pick us because we're hard
workers, we love the show,

287
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:37,080
and we're females getting
their own, on their own.

288
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:39,132
And cut! That was so great.

289
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:41,117
Chestnut walking in out of nowhere,

290
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,753
we could not have planned that.

291
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:43,971
Oh, but I did.

292
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:45,672
That's our gimmick. Try to beat that.

293
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,057
Two girls with a horse.

294
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:51,311
And how is this not a porn film?

295
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:55,632
♪ I knew it, we got it ♪

296
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,734
♪ I knew it, I saw it! ♪

297
00:11:57,736 --> 00:11:59,803
Is this how you imagined
it when you were laughing

298
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:01,688
<i>at all the dumb-dumbs on cupcake wars?</i>

299
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,991
I cannot believe I am auditioning

300
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>to be on Cupcake Wars.</i>

301
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:06,944
I am on the show I watch!

302
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:08,328
Life is totally awesome.

303
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,914
<i>Good morning. I'm the Cupcake Wars</i>

304
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,816
talent coordinating producer, Janis.

305
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:15,652
You are awesome. Your show's awesome.

306
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:18,088
Who would I talk to about
getting a mug to take home?

307
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,657
Not a gift shop.

308
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,293
Janis, hi, I'm Caroline,
and this is my partner, Max.

309
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:25,228
Loved your tape. Great characters.

310
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,630
- We are?
- We are.

311
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:28,432
Look, we're about to
start with the team intros.

312
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,333
The other team is up first and then you.

313
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,952
And remember to B.Y.O.B.

314
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,937
Oh, if I had known I was
allowed to bring a bottle in,

315
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:35,188
I wouldn't have chugged it in the bathroom.

316
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,307
Max, that's not what she meant.

317
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,276
The food network is very pg.

318
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:40,444
Janis, B.Y.O.B.?

319
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:41,728
"Bring your own brand."

320
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,113
Just like you did on your home tape.

321
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:45,816
You're edgy with big boobs.
You're the "try hard."

322
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,184
I'm sorry, I'm the what?

323
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:48,735
That's your brand.

324
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:49,953
The muscle and the hustle.

325
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:54,241
The double-d's and the ditz.

326
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:56,543
I went to wharton. I'm not a ditz.

327
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:59,362
Well you ain't the double-d's.

328
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:03,467
Can you believe she openly
commented on m'goods?

329
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:05,052
All right, we're ready for team one.

330
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,554
Step up.

331
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:09,723
You have 30 seconds.

332
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:12,542
Okay, cute aprons. But what's their brand?

333
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:15,012
In five, four, three, two...

334
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:17,213
- Hi, I'm Felicia.
- And I'm Blanche,

335
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:19,549
and we're representing the Crescent City.

336
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:22,486
Both: We're talking
about New Orleans, y'all!

337
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:25,522
Cute accents, but no one has
a scrappier story than us.

338
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:28,725
Back in 2005, when hurricane Katrina hit...

339
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:30,494
Say what?

340
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:33,163
And the levee broke and
flooded our whole neighborhood.

341
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:34,281
Say what?

342
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:36,900
Our community was
devastated, and we thought,

343
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,952
"hell yes, Katrina hit us hard."

344
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:41,254
"But hell no! We're not giving up."

345
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:44,458
We needed to find a way
to keep on keepin' on.

346
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,178
Katrina? Their brand is Katrina?

347
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,914
Even m'goods can't upstage that.

348
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,066
<i>We want to win Cupcake Wars</i>

349
00:13:53,068 --> 00:13:55,302
so we can finally open a storefront

350
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:56,586
in our little neighborhood.

351
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:58,088
Make our business official.

352
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,024
Yeah, and find a way to put
money back into our community.

353
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:02,609
That's what we're all about at...

354
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:04,544

00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:35,987
and you end up with a
mouth full of confetti.

534
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:38,073
Sophie's right.

535
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:40,442
We went on television with
the ridiculous expectation

536
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,127
that we'd make it overnight.

537
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:43,261
But that's not who we are.

538
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:44,879
We're gonna have to do it the hard way.

539
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:49,134
Slow and steady. The
tortoise and the whore.

540
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:52,503
Well, what can I say, "caramel?"

541
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:56,191
By the way, that's your whore name.

542
00:20:56,193 --> 00:21:00,345
Looks like it's back to
selling cakes one car at a time.

543
00:21:00,347 --> 00:21:03,448
I'll just put these "Ludacris
Specials" in the display case.

544
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,450
You do that, "Cinnamon."

545
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:07,786
Oh, no, I actually have a whore name,

546
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:11,122
and that's not it.

547
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:12,240
What is it?

548
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:16,861
Max. Duh.
