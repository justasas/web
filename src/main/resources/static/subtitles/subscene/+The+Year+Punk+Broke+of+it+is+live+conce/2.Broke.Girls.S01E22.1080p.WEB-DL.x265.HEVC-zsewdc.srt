1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:05,689
How could ketchup get this hard?

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,039
You just hold it in your hand like this, and say

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,559
You are the biggest ketchup I've ever had.

4
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,199
Hey, everybody. I got it, I got it.

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,639
Don't panic. At least you caught it in the early stage.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,459
No, I got the papers so we can see if our ticket win the lottery.

7
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,459
120 million dollars.

8
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,669
Fun! If we win, I'll get an eighth of my trust fund back.

9
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,279
Come on. Now, who's got our ticket?

10
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,609
I've got the ticket. I put it in here.

11
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:34,609
I figured it's where everybody else gets lucky.

12
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,509
By the way, if we win,

13
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:41,589
I'm gonna buy a condo right next to Great Adventure and go there everyday drunk.

14
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,639
Also put a soda fridge in my garage fo sho (for sure).

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,929
Earl, what are you gonna do with your share if we win?

16
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,509
Well, I'll get out of this club chop as fast as I can,

17
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,009
and set me up with some kind of a Hugh Hefner  situation.

18
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,519
Here we go, for the big money.

19
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,999
Woo. If I win, hello Netflix subscription.

20
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,199
We need a six, a ten, a five, a 12 and a nine.

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,199
And the first number is¡­6!

22
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,169
And the second number is 47.

23
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,249
Good thing I didn't pay my share of the tickets yet, suckers!

24
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:34,883
Before I forget, I printed up more of our cupcake business cards

25
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:37,093
So we can hand them out at the Williamsburg crafts fair.

26
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,563
Oh, can't wait

27
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:40,543
Me and you handing out free cupcakes

28
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:42,413
stuck between hipsters selling crochet

29
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:45,383
iPad sleeves and Salt-n-Pepa Salt and Pepper Shakers.

30
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:49,113
We are not just giving them away for free. It's marketing.

31
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:51,583
One person eats it and spreads it around their friends.

32
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,973
So we are herpes.

33
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:58,633
Hello, Sophie.

34
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:02,083
If you looked any sweeter, you would fire up my diabetes.

35
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:07,793
Oh, Earl. You wouldn't be the first man to lose a limb over me.

36
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:11,423
Sophie, I'm surprised to see you in here.

37
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,473
Stutter buzz says you and Oleg are no longer together.

38
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,533
Wow, this little girl likes to gossip. Yes?

39
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,233
Won't you scutter your little butt over there

40
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,503
Come see me in my booth.

41
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:32,693
Are we over here so Oleg can't see you through the kitchen window?

42
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:36,873
What is this? Diner or back issue of Cosmopolitan magazines?

43
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,123
I grew up reading Cosmo.

44
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:42,793
I mean, what a six-year-old doesn't need to know? The hidden male erogenous zones.

45
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,793
It's the nipples, the end.

46
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,093
I came to give you girls a cleaning job tomorrow.

47
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:51,413
We can't tomorrow. We are doing the crafts fair.

48
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,923
We are turning down a real paying job to go to the crap fair?

49
00:02:55,323 --> 00:02:58,373
Yes, it's important that we focus on the cupcake business.

50
00:02:58,373 --> 00:03:01,273
And you can't spell "focus" without "us".

51
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:03,363
Or FU.

52
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,893
Hello, Sophie.

53
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:10,893
Hello, Oleg.

54
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,443
So, do you miss the sex?

55
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,733
Oh, you know what? We should go.

56
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,343
No. We are having a conversation here.

57
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:20,803
And besides, the sex was not that good.

58
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:23,203
Oh, it was that good.

59
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:25,723
It wasn't that good.

60
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:27,723
Please, I beg you. Let us go.

61
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:29,723
You can go. I'm kind of into it.

62
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:32,743
Like, it's like a dirty Downton Abbey.

63
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:36,253
So why are you still standing there

64
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,863
giving me those sad, cow eyes

65
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,863
in that brown velure.

66
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,863
Because it's a good look on me.

67
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:47,673
And because I'm waiting for you to admit that you came here

68
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:49,123
because you miss the sex.

69
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:51,683
I miss summers in Minsk.

70
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:54,283
I miss smoking in hospitals.

71
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,523
But I don't miss the sex.

72
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:05,573
Fine, then. What would you like to eat?

73
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:08,363
I'll have my usual sausage.

74
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:14,093
Ok, ding. It's ready.

75
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:22,073
Max's homemade cupcakes.

76
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,453
Max's delicious homemade cupcakes

77
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,963
- Let's move this along. Max's homemade cupcakes.

78
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:34,753
Max, come on. Could you at least try and have a better attitude at the crafts fair?

79
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:39,943
I was doing fine until my hair got gang feather by that girl from that church of good vibes.

80
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,193
Hi!

81
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:46,491
I'm from the Funnel Cake booth back there

82
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:51,283
and your little table is sadder than watching the notebook at a funeral.

83
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:56,493
Hey Dutch girl,

84
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:58,863
why don't you go stick your finger in a dyke.

85
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:03,833
I'm sure you can find one over near the plus sized denim.

86
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,563
Max, please. We are all business woman here.

87
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,753
Yeah. Some of us wearing table cloth on their heads.

88
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,083
Just so you know they make shift tables cause we are just starting out.

89
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,973
We've only been in business eight months.

90
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:23,083
Heidi, how long have we been funneling?

91
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,893
Everyday 24-7 for the past three months.

92
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:28,863
And we already have a booth.

93
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:30,313
Yeah we do.

94
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,633
I have to say you girls really take the fun out of funnel.

95
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,923
Actually we put the fun in the funnel.

96
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:41,393
See? You can't start "funnel" without "fun".

97
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,393
Or FU.

98
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:52,693
Three months and they've already had a booth. We're behind.

99
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,093
Max's homemade cupcakes.

100
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:55,523
Take this!

101
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:58,713
See? Success!

102
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:01,663
Scaring people into participating isn't success.

103
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:03,523
It's Scientology.

104
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,383
Calling Sophie we're taking that job.

105
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,927
You'd better have a good reason you're late,

106
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:18,797
because I managed to get here on time despite removing the disease pigeon feathers from my hair.

107
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:20,477
I do.

108
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:25,187
So today when we were cleaning up that apartment and I had my hands in a total stranger's toilet,

109
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:29,307
I realized if we're really gonna be successful, we've got to think outside the bull.

110
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:31,917
So after I thoroughly washed my hands,

111
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,747
I know they never really come off though, right?

112
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,177
Off your soul, I mean.

113
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:40,027
I made a call to a connection I know and got us a real cupcake job.

114
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:44,477
And it's in Manhattan. It's the first birthday party for the son of a socialite.

115
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:48,057
60 cupcakes with buttercream frosting. Up top.

116
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:49,317
Buttercream?

117
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:52,207
This is not the response I was expecting from my business partner.

118
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:55,867
I was expecting wooo! Awesome job! Thumbs up, buddy.

119
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:59,617
Why? Is your business partner on a show on Nicklodeon?

120
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,597
Look I don't do buttercream.

121
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,037
Buttercream is a bitch.

122
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:09,087
If it doesn't stay refrigerated, it falls apart as fast as a two-celebrity marriage.

123
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:13,887
Max we have to take this job, it's the next step for us,

124
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:17,267
cause all we're doing these days is cleaning apartment and working at the diner.

125
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,077
That's not all I'm doing. I also babysit for Peach.

126
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:21,597
Oh, Peach is fine with it.

127
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,477
Why would Peach be fine with it?

128
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,447
Look I was gonna tell you this after the Nickelodeon high five

129
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,937
but that didn't happen and I got thrown.

130
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:31,247
Peach is the connection I used to get us the party.

131
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:34,497
You called Peach without asking me and begged her for a job?

132
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:37,392
I didn't beg. I ask her if she knew anybody who could use us

133
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,977
and she was more than happy to recommend us for her friend Constance.

134
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:42,297
No way I'm not comfortable with this.

135
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,877
Sometimes you have to do things that make you uncomfortable.

136
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:45,950
It's the way you grow.

137
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,757
No it's the way you get a ride home from a keger in the woods.

138
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:52,187
Max.

139
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:55,637
Max I'm sorry but we can't turn into those people who work and work

140
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:58,787
just to pay their bill don't have any time to pursue their dreams.

141
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,167
You mean Americans?

142
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:06,257
I'm telling Peach tomorrow we're not doing it. Now go get some milk.

143
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:09,867
No problem cause that's what waitresses do and

144
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,867
apparently that's all we'll ever be.

145
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,637
What?

146
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:31,287
I have to prove the sex was not that good.

147
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,227
Oleg on the food?

148
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,517
Don't say it like that,

149
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:38,117
That ham was already glaced before we go there.

150
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:51,547
So I am guessing you are back together?

151
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,277
Oh no no, the sex was not that good.

152
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:57,147
Oh, it was that good.

153
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,557
I went to get Mayo,

154
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:09,557
and it all happened so fast.

155
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:31,647
Ok babies, give me fashion, give me a face, yea.

156
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:34,138
Peach, I don't know what's going on in your apartment,

157
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:36,287
but I would like it on the record:

158
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:38,467
I'm not a willing accomplice.

159
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:40,707
So what is going on here?

160
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:43,627
Well, Brad is giving us seduction like his name sake

161
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,377
and Angelina is giving us nothing like her name sake.

162
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:50,927
This is pretty fancy set up, were the kids nominated for an Oscar?

163
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:53,957
Best performance by twins in a ridiculous situation?

164
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:56,577
It's a photo spread for my new mummy blog,

165
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:59,977
I'm calling it Mummy and Me. Isn't that clever?

166
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:01,977
And original.

167
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:04,987
I had a blog since my friend Constance started her blog,

168
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:07,577
we both have blogs and we both have babies.

169
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,687
Only her babies are adopted from Africa.

170
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:12,697
She will be winning if I didn't have two from a poor white hell billy thuggery.

171
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:19,957
About your friend Constance, I think I was supposed to do a party for her.

172
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:23,267
Max, please don't screw this up because I hate her and I need her to love me.

173
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:26,907
Yea, here is the thing. Thank you,

174
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:29,717
but Caroline should never have called you and asked you for a favor.

175
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:31,161
I'm not comfortable asking to do that.

176
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:33,643
But I did it for you.

177
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:35,358
And now you will do that for me.

178
00:10:35,537 --> 00:10:37,607
And Max this has to go swimmingly

179
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:39,577
which is a new word I just learned.

180
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:42,527
So you are saying I can't get out of it?

181
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:45,237
I'm saying: Max, you can't get out of it.

182
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:51,767
Max, still not talking to me because of the Peach thing?

183
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:53,507
Fine.

184
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:57,797
Those are some pretty bad ass buttercream cupcakes,

185
00:10:57,797 --> 00:11:00,087
ain't no drama going on in that box!

186
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:05,177
Ok, I just went gangster, and not even a smile?

187
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:07,447
What? Are you planning to never talk to me again?

188
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:10,907
You nodded, if you were deaf that would be talking.

189
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:13,407
That's true, my brother is deaf,

190
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:15,867
not from birth, from firecrackers.

191
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:18,958
Relax, we still have time.

192
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,542
Ten more minutes on the train and a 15-minute walk.

193
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,547
The buttercreams are not gonna melt.

194
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:26,247
- Some people just like to create non-verbal drama. - En huh.

195
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:32,977
Attention passengers.

196
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:35,077
- There is an obstruction up on the track ahead. - No.

197
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,747
I bet someone jumped in front of the train.

198
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:41,065
Oh my God, what a tragedy,

199
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,127
the buttercream!

200
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:47,741
Attention passengers.

201
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,748
We apologize for this delay.

202
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:52,287
There is still an obstruction on the tracks ahead.

203
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,567
It's totally like a body.

204
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,247
They can't get it off and what not.

205
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,057
We should be moving shortly.

206
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,837
What is with this guy? He said that 20 minutes ago.

207
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:04,567
How are your cupcakes? Mine are getting a little loose.

208
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:07,567
Still? Still not talking?

209
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,897
Fine, Max. Now I'm not talking neither.

210
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:13,337
What is with her? She said that 20 minutes ago, too.

211
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,167
And she just keeps talking.

212
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,307
I know, right?

213
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:20,857
We probably hit the body.

214
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:22,977
So it is all up in the wheeling and what not.

215
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,657
Well, if there is what not under our wheels, and I don't get these cupcakes there,

216
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,827
I'm going to lose my babysitting job.

217
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:31,852
- Are we babysitters or bakers? - I was talking to him.

218
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,455
Stay out of this.

219
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:34,307
Nina,

220
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:36,933
if you two are bakers, maybe you should break up some of those cupcakes,

221
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,517
so we all don't starve.

222
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:40,362
No one is touching these cupcakes.

223
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:43,807
Our entire future is riding on these mothers.

224
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:45,857
I think I'm smelling like a, like a dead body smell.

225
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:49,347
Miss, you are making things so much worse in here.

226
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,207
Are you telling me you don't smell that?

227
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:54,877
It's like when my sister burned herself throwing firecrackers at my brother's ear.

228
00:12:58,797 --> 00:13:00,887
This train is out of service.

229
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:04,217
We are approximately two blocks away from the next station.

230
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,757
We're gonna have to take you on foot.

231
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:08,837
Please form a single line and we will escort you to safety.

232
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:10,007
We are gonna walk?

233
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:12,587
They expect me to walk through a subway tunnel in heels?

234
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:15,667
Hey everybody I think we know who we are gonna eat first.

235
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:22,227
My god, it's so hot up in here. It's like 200 degrees.

236
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:23,821
If I faint and fall down,

237
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:25,987
the others rats will like eat me and what not.

238
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,587
Rats? Max, are there rats?

239
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:31,137
It's a subway. The floor is made of rats,

240
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:33,537
but you really have to worry about, the ninja turtles.

241
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,407
Thank you for responding.

242
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:37,467
Hold up.

243
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:40,527
I'm telling you right now. If I lose my babysitting job over this,

244
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,127
the rats would be the better option for you.

245
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:45,857
We are only two blocks from the station. We can still make it.

246
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:47,677
How are your cupcakes?

247
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,467
They are still holding together.

248
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,747
Like us. We are still holding together.

249
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:57,667
Geez, come on, don't bring gal. Less talk more walk.

250
00:13:57,997 --> 00:14:00,077
Folks, It's a bit of gap here.

251
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:02,797
A gap? There can't be a gap. Why is there a gap?

252
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:05,147
Because people need reasonably price basics.

253
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:08,017
I'm gonna hop across and help the rest of you over.

254
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:14,903
Hey miss, you are next.

255
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,814
I put the line on, just grab it.

256
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:19,570
You know how many times I heard that from a guy in the tunnel?

257
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:21,657
Hey, just take these.

258
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:23,847
Careful, sir, it's buttercream!

259
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,217
I'm throwing you my purse. Here it comes.

260
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,567
Thank you. Right. Thank you.

261
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:36,947
Ok, miss, you next.

262
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,947
Hand me over the cupcakes and jump.

263
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:42,359
I can't. I'm terrified.

264
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,572
What if I fall? The rats will eat me.

265
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:45,797
I can never come back from that.

266
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,408
Bankruptcy? Yes. Rats? No.

267
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:48,670
"Hey Caroline, where are your toes?"

268
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,669
"Well, it's a long story."

269
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:52,143
Girl, if you fall that third rail,

270
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:54,878
it will fry you way before the rats get there.

271
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:57,941
Listen, Mariah, you are freaking me out.

272
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:01,157
If we're lucky, the rats will eat your mouth.

273
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:05,927
Caroline, it's ok. It's just a step. Take the step.

274
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:07,757
Hold these.

275
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:09,897
Come on, I'm right here.

276
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:12,367
I took the step, now you have to take the step.

277
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:15,347
That's right. You did. I do.

278
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,424
Here we go.

279
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:19,268
Back up everybody. Yea!

280
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:21,613
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

281
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:23,896
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

282
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:26,880
Go Caroline, go Caroline, ahhhhhhh!

283
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,377
I saw a rat. We made eye contact.

284
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:33,217
You know what? It would probably be easier if took those heels off.

285
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:35,948
Sir, that is never going to happen.

286
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,218
We are in Manhattan.

287
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:40,367
I may be under it but I'm still in it.

288
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:41,849
And when they pull out my half-eaten body,

289
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:45,227
I will be wearing my heels.

290
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:50,699
Mariah?

291
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,233
Why? I only have one.

292
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:53,894
What are you gonna do?

293
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:56,901
Jump back over and do something and whatnot?

294
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:01,737
Constance, we're sorry, we are late.

295
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:04,327
I don't wait. I don't wait for anything.

296
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,677
I already have the iPhone 8.

297
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:09,367
Sorry, we couldn't help it. We were trapped on the subway.

298
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,387
Well, just put some cupcakes on a plate

299
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,167
cause I got a roomful of women out there who need to cut something in half

300
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:19,137
and then eat the other half, and they need to do it now!

301
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:23,787
Welcome back to Manhattan. How do they look?

302
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:27,097
Like they all had unprotected sex with each other?

303
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,437
Oh, how are you two? I'm looking for the babies, I'm about just ten seconds I'm just giving up.

304
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:36,227
- Peach, there is a problem with the cupcakes.  - There can't be.

305
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:39,417
Constance will kill me, literally. Her last two best friends went missing.

306
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,457
That is not attractive at all.

307
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:45,137
Is... is that what food looks like?

308
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,727
Why are there no cupcakes out? If you two work for me, I deport you.

309
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:57,537
There is a bit of cupcake situation. The buttercream sort of broke down on the way up.

310
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:01,367
It's not a problem, we can fix it.

311
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,807
I'll just run to a delly get what we need to touch them up and no one's the wiser.

312
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:09,497
And I take the full responsibility. My partner warned me that buttercream was a bitch.

313
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:12,777
I'm not being rude, that's technical baking term.

314
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:15,837
You expect me to pay 300 dollars for these?

315
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:20,027
Caroline Channing, I have to say that you're a bigger con artist than your father.

316
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,747
Then I have to say you're a bigger bitch than the buttercream.

317
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:27,247
I'm not your boss, so I can't hit you.

318
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:32,307
But I'm sure that Peach won't be your boss much longer either.

319
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,077
Right, Peach?

320
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:35,697
But I love Max.

321
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:38,067
She's been with me since I bought the twins.

322
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:40,597
I can't live without her.

323
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:42,357
You are never coming to another one of my parties.

324
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:43,577
Max, you're fired.

325
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:54,207
It's my fault. You lost your babysitting job, and I feel awful.

326
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,927
Hey, I'm the one who call that bitch a "bitch".

327
00:17:56,927 --> 00:18:00,107
And I'm gonna write those awesome films right up until we got evicted.

328
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:05,677
Why can't you just admit that the sex was that good?

329
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:10,717
You know it, I know it, the ham with the bite marks in the freezer knows it.

330
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,157
Ok, fine. The sex was that good,

331
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:18,157
as was the ham.

332
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,397
It was that good because it was more than just sex.

333
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:23,797
It was love.

334
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:27,487
Oh... it is not love.

335
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,527
Oh, it is love.

336
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:32,767
Oh... it is not love.

337
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:36,687
It was dirty, disgusting sex.

338
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,237
Yes, it was.

339
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:48,467
Oleg, do you really love Sophie?

340
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:51,817
Yes, I do. And one day I will kiss her.

341
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,697
Her lips will be mine.

342
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,617
Wait, you never kissed her?

343
00:18:58,057 --> 00:18:59,887
Not on the lips of her face.

344
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:06,827
But that day will come.

345
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:11,947
Man, I can't believe that I'm actually saying this,

346
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:15,037
but that is pretty freaking romantic.

347
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:20,617
I'm looking for Max, I think her last name is "Black".

348
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:23,767
Oh, sorry, maybe it's "African American"?

349
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:29,427
You think her name is "Max African American"?

350
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:32,887
Peach, what're you doing here? Who's with the twins?

351
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,897
They're in the car, don't worry,

352
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:37,617
I rolled up the windows and locked the doors, so they're safe.

353
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,917
Max, I'm sorry for pretending to fire you in front of the Constance.

354
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,967
Pretended? That felt pretty real.

355
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:49,497
Yeah, I'm good. My fake orgasms are so real even I believe them.

356
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:54,057
Peach, this is all my fault. Please give Max her job back.

357
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:57,647
That's why I'm here. Max, come back, I need you to watch them tomorrow,

358
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,377
and then everyday.

359
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:02,707
Peach, I don't think I can work for you tomorrow,

360
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:04,287
or any other day.

361
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:06,877
We have to focus on our business.

362
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:09,997
Max, are you sure you're comfortable with this?

363
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:12,737
No, I'm not comfortable, but that's the point, right?

364
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:14,117
You gotta take a step.

365
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,967
Well, then how about just for another year?

366
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:19,557
By then the twins will be old enough to take care of themselves.

367
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:26,637
No, but I promise I'll come by and say "Hi" to the twins whenever I can.

368
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:27,937
Oh, Max,

369
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:31,217
I will never find someone as wonderful as you who speaks English.

370
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,267
Bye, Max.

371
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:40,207
Wow, good for you, good for us.

372
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:44,337
Hope so. That's the first job I ever quit without a job to take its place.

373
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,947
You have another job. You work for yourself.

374
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:48,667
You're your own boss.

375
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:52,677
My own boss? I can't wait to sleep with myself to get a promotion.
