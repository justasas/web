1
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,588
Miko...

2
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,426
Miko, please protect this child.

3
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,408
Miyu.

4
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,115
Has your sister come back yet?

5
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,389
I had a bad dream last night.

6
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,899
I felt paralyzed when I
first woke up this morning.

7
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,699
Miyu may have been killed...

8
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,930
Don't say such things.

9
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,972
It was just a dream.

10
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,532
I hope so.

11
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,868
I will make sure tonight.

12
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,510
Making sure means you will do...

13
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,407
...what, exactly?

14
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,249
Please, Shizuka.

15
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,888
Why are you laughing?

16
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,723
I'm relieved.

17
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,887
Finally, Miko is back
to her old self again.

18
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,662
I can't use Ninjutsu, but
I always want to help you.

19
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,341
We are friends.

20
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,875
Thats right.

21
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:51,075
I may look unreliable, but
I will do my best for Miko.

22
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,587
Finally, it will be born.

23
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,497
I've looked forward to this moment.

24
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,446
Come here...

25
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,588
Whats that?

26
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,451
This way...

27
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,823
...come here.

28
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,974
Thats right, go up.

29
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,443
This way...

30
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,293
Yes, this way.

31
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,268
Come here.

32
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,643
I will make you happy...

33
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,439
...come here.

34
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,923
Rape the woman...

35
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,731
Now.

36
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,370
Miyu, why?

37
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,255
What are you doing here?

38
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:40,865
Where are you from?

39
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,233
Do you understand what I'm saying?

40
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,777
This child is...

41
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,321
...cursed by birth.

42
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,624
Who are you?

43
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,688
One of the Miroku Clan...

44
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,226
...Hiro.

45
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,631
The Miroku Clan? Don't lie.

46
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,436
Miyu and I are the only survivors.

47
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,769
The Miroku Clan has
scattered nationwide...

48
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,411
...in order to prepare for the
final battle with the Sex Fiends.

49
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,372
Why did you try to kill her?

50
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,819
Miyu sent a telepathic
message when she died.

51
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,391
She told me to kill her.

52
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,128
Stab me.

53
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,368
My mission is only to kill her...

54
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,544
...but I can't do it right now.

55
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,576
Because I'm not sure
why I have to kill her.

56
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,121
Whats your name?

57
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,091
Miyabi.

58
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,795
I'm Miko.

59
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,938
Miko?

60
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,910
You aren't strong
enough to win, Miroku Clan.

61
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,536
Increase the number of your friends.

62
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:42,982
Make the girl awaken
and open the way for us.

63
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:50,524
That girl, Miyabi, is the key
to connect our world with yours.

64
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:59,364
If the two worlds connect, I
will give you limitless power.

65
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:04,775
It is a power that can't
be had in your world.

66
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:15,879
Go!

67
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,983
Run, or we'll be late.

68
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,449
Hurry up.

69
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,356
What happened to your sister?

70
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,425
I think she was killed.

71
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,926
Oh, God...

72
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,899
This is our destiny.

73
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,399
So...

74
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,970
I don't like it.

75
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,003
Thank you.

76
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,579
I'll definitely protect Miko.

77
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,009
So, please don't die.

78
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,930
Bido, its a strange name.

79
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,365
Hello, home delivery service.

80
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,884
Shit, isn't anyone around?

81
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,647
Hello, I'm from a home delivery service.

82
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:11,067
Good afternoon,
I'm from Smile Delivery.

83
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,501
Can I get your stamp?

84
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,035
I need your stamp here.

85
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,848
If you don't have
one, a signature is fine.

86
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,245
Good old Bido!

87
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,150
You are from the Bido family, the
strongest family in the Miroku Clan.

88
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:43,652
Who are you?

89
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,088
My name is Yaku,
one of the Miroku Clan.

90
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:52,096
For me, babies stop crying, old men get
hard, and young boys come five times.

91
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,326
Nice to meet you.

92
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,598
You don't trust me.

93
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,498
Why not look at my family emblem?

94
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,337
Yoo hoo!

95
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:22,459
Suiton magic.

96
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:27,722
I heard that you use
Suiton magic in the water.

97
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,833
No, no, no, the Amateur
Clan doesn't know anything.

98
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,037
In the context of Sexual Magic...

99
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,465
...the man inserts.

100
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,647
The woman's moaning
makes him even harder.

101
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:49,076
No, no, no, stop!

102
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,586
Finally, the man reaches the
point of no return and almost comes.

103
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,147
At that moment...

104
00:29:55,059 --> 00:30:00,691
...you suck his semen and at
the same time inject a lethal curse.

105
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,466
Sounds horrific.

106
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:10,507
Suck and kill, we call it Suiton Magic.

107
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,735
Are you serious?

108
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,172
Yaku, when you
came, was anyone here?

109
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,773
No, I thought I was just lucky
because the front door was open.

110
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,777
The girl was kidnapped.

111
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:23,612
Oh!

112
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,856
Miko, ask me
anything If you need me.

113
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,158
Me too.

114
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,526
Thank you.

115
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,530
Hey, Yaku...

116
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,499
...please teach me how
to use Sexual Magic sometime.

117
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,006
If you learn it, you will enjoy
making love repeatedly, without tiering.

118
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:45,835
See you.

119
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,740
Shall I see you home?

120
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,102
No thank you, I'm fine.

121
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,837
Its good for you that Yaku came.

122
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:50,744
Right?

123
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,313
She will help you to
forget your sadness.

124
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,581
She's just so boisterous.

125
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,946
See you.

126
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,512
I'll take off.

127
00:30:59,123 --> 00:30:59,612
Good bye.

128
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:00,588
Good bye.

129
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,382
Good bye.

130
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,645
What are you doing?

131
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,345
I have to find the
girl I was talking about.

132
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,412
I have a feeling that she has
something to do with the Sex Fiends.

133
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,644
Is that so?

134
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,626
What do you have in your hand?

135
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:25,785
Nothing special.

136
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:27,990
Don't get on my nerves.

137
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,825
Did you notice?

138
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,761
This is a great chance!

139
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,039
What do you think about this?

140
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,804
Its impossible to find them by praying.

141
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,138
Can you find them?

142
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,471
You haven't changed.

143
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,742
Yaku, you haven't told her anything...

144
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,109
...have you?

145
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,912
Because you were
talking about a camp-fire...

146
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,752
...l'm in the mood to roast
potatoes and marshmallows.

147
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,051
Do you know her?

148
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,857
She's a bitch.

149
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,528
She has a short
temper and is very bossy.

150
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,568
Seems that she is better than you.

151
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,003
Tell me...

152
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,335
How many Miroku families are there?

153
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:46,737
Three.

154
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,344
We will locate her with this.

155
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,409
Is your purpose to find and kill her?

156
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,527
Don't move.

157
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,059
If you move, they will eat your eyeballs.

158
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,699
Don't make a noise.

159
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,310
Looks like they like you.

160
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,676
Why don't you enjoy it?

161
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:52,042
You can enjoy sex you
have never before experienced.

162
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,676
You are dripping all over.

163
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,146
Are you feeling good?

164
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,221
The time has come to finish.

165
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,934
If she dies, it all comes to nothing.

166
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,940
I will feel your body all over.

167
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,758
Miyu and I are
cousins, and the same age.

168
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,691
We grew up like sisters...

169
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,239
...before you were born.

170
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:06,206
I haven't seen her
since I left the Miroku village.

171
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:18,752
She was kind, but also
stubborn and she never cried.

172
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:27,999
Miko, you should
cry when you feel pain.

173
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,056
This will be tough...

174
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,993
...but we have to
win the battle for Miyu.

175
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,432
You are easily defeated.

176
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,074
Are you really a match for me?

177
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,982
I feel very good right now.

178
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,414
My body is filled with power.

179
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,187
I feel that I could do anything.

180
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,458
So you say, but it seems like
you can't fight without hiding.

181
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,256
Why don't you come out
and fight fair and square?

182
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:11,338
Its a shame that such a legendary
clan can't strike back, isn't it?

183
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,274
Miko Bido...

184
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,721
I can take care of you by myself.

185
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,849
Miko, leave it to me and go ahead.

186
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,428
Yaku, lets go.

187
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,123
Yes.

188
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,999
I am your opponent.

189
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,904
Misaki, Shizuka!

190
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,019
You fell for my trick.

191
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:13,916
What?

192
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,242
You are ambitious.

193
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:21,115
Let me see how
delicious a Miroku woman is.

194
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,399
Misaki...

195
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,938
How do you feel?

196
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:52,077
Soon, the snake's poison will stimulate
you all over, and you will lose control.

197
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,445
Let them enjoy you for a while...

198
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,981
...until you lose your mind.

199
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,937
This girl will awake soon.

200
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,601
If the girl wakes up
and becomes a Sex Fiend...

201
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,610
...the door to the Realm
of the Sex Fiends will open.

202
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:33,050
She will be the strongest Sex
Fiend, descended from your family.

203
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:34,822
Misaki!

204
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:42,493
No!

205
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,802
No!

206
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,244
No!

207
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,922
...almost coming.

208
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:23,502
Once you start moaning,
you can't stop, can you?

209
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:30,871
The ecstasy they
give you will be limitless.

210
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,613
Its a wonderfully muscular vagina.

211
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,682
Good old Miroku Clan!

212
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,150
Miroku Sex Magic, Hydrochloric Hell!

213
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:19,754
When I go into
ecstasy, I secrete a strong acid.

214
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,963
You used a dirty trick!

215
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,999
You melted my
most important member!

216
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,797
Lmportant member?

217
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,806
You have no right to say that
because you didn't make me come.

218
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,948
Wait, come back.

219
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,374
You must not go to such a place.

220
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,319
I'm not your enemy.

221
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,389
Please come back.

222
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,652
You are a human being.

223
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:31,624
You shouldn't become a sex fiend.

224
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:36,736
You have the same blood as we have.

225
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:40,576
Wait...

226
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,112
Don't take the girl.

227
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:54,847
Hiro!

228
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,031
Miko.

229
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:56,102
Miko.

230
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,539
Hiro!

231
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:07,947
Hiro!

232
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:14,754
Hiro!

233
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,830
Please protect the girl.

234
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,203
The door is opened.

235
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,777
It means we can enter anywhere.

236
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:10,349
Miroku Clan, get ready to
put your lives on the line.

237
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,556
I will finish you.

238
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:21,626
I will give these two
our power in our world.

239
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:27,035
Then, your end will come.

240
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:33,208
Look forward to the next time we meet.

241
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,015
Hiro.

242
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:50,749
Hiro...

243
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:57,730
Miko...

244
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,794
Miko, you are right.

245
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:08,141
That girl has the blood
of the Miroku Clan in her.

246
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,848
She won't become a Sex Fiend easily.

247
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:20,353
Hiro, don't die, Hiro.

248
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:28,625
The special board I gave
you, gather our comrades by it...

249
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:34,994
...with the girl.

250
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,329
Now what?

251
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:38,701
I have no idea.

252
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,944
Even though its not your strong point...

253
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,520
Use your head.

254
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,125
The girl is...

255
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:07,159
...here.

256
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:28,080
I will go see Miyu first.

257
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,391
Hiro!

258
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,666
Hiro, don't die, Hiro.

259
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:46,202
Hiro.

260
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:49,802
Hiro.

261
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,177
Hiro.
