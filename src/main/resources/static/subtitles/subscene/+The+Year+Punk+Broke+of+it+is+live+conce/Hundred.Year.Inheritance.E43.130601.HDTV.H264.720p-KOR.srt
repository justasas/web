<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,200
Episode 43

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,720
I'm off then.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,690
What brings you out here again?

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,360
Just got curious so I came by.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,510
You said you were busy.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,910
Ignore him and just go.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,940
I'll go after seeing you off first.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,100
Get inside quickly.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,380
Alright...

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,380
The sibling relationship looks good.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,850
What do you mean, sibling? What are you talking about?

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,100
Well,

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,280
I wonder what it could mean.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,620
I'm just saying that you seem friendly and cozy like siblings.

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,370
Don't mind me.

17
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,860
Stop talking nonsense and go already.

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,850
Come to think of it, you two seem to resemble each other too.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,330
No, I think that's overstating it.

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,250
What are you trying to do now?

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,190
Heaven helps the one who helps himself or something? My sincerity has reached the heavens, should I say?

22
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,900
I think even the heaven have been moved by my one-woman loving determination, don't you think?

23
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,190
I'm getting a mixed feeling about this and the tip of my nose is twinging (making me emotional - about to cry).

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,730
Ai this man...without returning home as you planned and why are you back again?

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,760
Ah yes, well I was about to return home but I felt so elated so..

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,200
So I came by.

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,500
Don't reveal the secret of nature! (you promised to not say anything)

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,230
If you easily open your mouth, you can get zapped by the thunderbolt &amp; lightening.

29
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,120
Shut your mouth, please.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,050
Yes, yes, yes. I was about to leave

31
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,350
I'll be going.

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,080
Let's see you again~

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,300
I'm off.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,410
I'll go ahead first

35
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,470
Uh, ok.

36
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,500
Take care.

37
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,750
Aunt 
Huh?

38
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,760
Wha-what?

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,460
A moment ago with that man (Cheol Gyu)

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,310
what were you talking about?

41
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,110
Uh, just, um,

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,840
I haven't seen him in a while so

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
just asked about his well-being.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,540
It's nothing.

45
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,340
Mommy, mommy mommy, mommy,

46
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,810
Aigoo, aigoo, why the sudden flippancy?

47
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,510
No matter how I look at it, I think Chae Won and I are about to get a happy ending.

48
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,150
Without a doubt, the heaven was on my side.

49
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,950
What is that you're saying?

50
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,960
I can't say because I'm not supposed to reveal the secrets of the nature,

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,010
but just know that in short time, my Chae Won is going to return to us, so

52
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,770
mom, you need to be well prepared.

53
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,590
I mean, are you saying that Chae Won, that thing, is planning on coming to you?

54
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,220
Um-hm. It's predicted that she'll be back to me.

55
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,130
It's become impossible for her not to be back to me.

56
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,780
It's become impossible not to return...ai, say it so I can understand!

57
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,180
Mom, if you know too much, you could get hurt. Today, let's just stop it here.

58
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,610
Kim Cheol Gyoo, hooray!

59
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,350
Chairman Bang, double hooray!

60
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,690
Aigoo, why are you doing this?

61
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,870
It's great.
It's great.

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,400
What the heck...?

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,360
What is this?

64
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,480
I think you should take this medicine, instead of me.

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,140
Why does your face look so tired?

66
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,620
Is there something that's bothering you?

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,850
No.

68
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,630
What's there to bother me about...

69
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,250
By the way, father-in-law,

70
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,240
this time, I think you should admit yourself into the hospital.

71
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,170
I think I can withstand the pain still.

72
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,480
Which is why I'm bringing it up,

73
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,630
let's set the date for Chae Won's wedding quickly.

74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,580
What?

75
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,820
I don't think I have very much time left.

76
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,990
Before I die,

77
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,890
I would like to pair Chae Won up with her partner.

78
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:50,410
I hear you and the in-law have a special relationship. So, discuss amongst yourselves, and set the date.

79
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm home.

80
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,510
Are you coming back from dropping Chae Won off at home?

81
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes.

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,190
Then, did you also see Chae Won's mom?

83
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,980
Nope.

84
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,920
We said our goodbyes in front of her house because I had some work left to do.

85
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,310
Ah, I see.

86
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,760
Then, I'm going to my room to rest.

87
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,830
Oh, mom. By the way,

88
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,880
Do you know per chance,

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,830
What about?

90
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,140
Whereabouts of Chae Won mom's son?

91
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,940
Wha-what are you talking about?

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,600
I heard two of you gave birth at the same time at a maternity clinic, 30 years ago.

93
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,110
I say, from whom did you hear that?

94
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,970
Last time I had dinner with Chae Won's mom, I heard it from her.

95
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,440
It seemed that Chae Won had no idea.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,770
I wondered how that could be?

97
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,850
Choon Hee sister-in-law's son died as soon as he was born.

98
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,560
He died?

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,200
Yes.

100
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,870
After her husband died of car accident,

101
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,480
shortly after, the baby died too, which caused Sister-in-law Choon Hee to lose her mind.

102
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,710
I didn't think it possible for her to get a grip of herself and re-establish another household like that.

103
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,830
I couldn't imagine.

104
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,060
She seems always so bright and fun so I didn't suspect mother-in-law could have such a tale.

105
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh, by the way, I think I better lie down.

106
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,940
Can I ask you something?

107
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,040
Yes, Oppa.

108
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,190
Why did you get a divorce?

109
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,450
That human being..

110
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:37,100
Ah no..My ex-husband couldn't make a living very well,

111
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,740
our personalities didn't mesh very well either, so we divorced.

112
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,490
I see.

113
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,710
You are...disappointed, right?

114
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,570
It's because my heart aches at the thought of my Sook suffering.

115
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,150
It's not that I'm disappointed.

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,470
<i>"How can every word he utters be so classy and of good quality?"</i>

117
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,440
<i>"It's the kind of words that would move a king's heart"</i>

118
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,200
I didn't know your in-laws operate a noodle factory.

119
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,310
I thought your dad ran a barbershop.

120
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,490
A barbershop?

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,510
We did. Then

122
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,800
we became bankrupt and then took over the management of the noodle factory that our grandfather was running.

123
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,510
Is that right?

124
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,750
Oppa,

125
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,820
why don't you go?

126
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,280
No, I'm going to see you off before I go.

127
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,720
No,

128
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,190
Oppa go ahead first.

129
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,950
How about we play rock, paper, scissors, and the losing person leaves first?

130
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,670
Oh, gosh..

131
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,440
Oppa, how can we, like children...

132
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,820
Let it be then.

133
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,800
Rock, paper, scissors! Whoo~

134
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,900
Yayyy! I won!

135
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,630
Now, you can go first.

136
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,620
Should I do that then?

137
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,760
I have to take the step I don't want to take then.

138
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,100
My Sook, sleep well.

139
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,470
What are you doing here?

140
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,640
Oh my god you scared me!

141
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,570
Ewww, seriously!

142
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,990
This darn woman!

143
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,630
Where have you been all day long and come in this late? Do you do this knowing what time it is?

144
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,400
Look here, Mr. Uhm Ki Choon.

145
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,000
My name isn't "darn wife", but it's Gong Kang Sook.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,120
Why do you leave a perfectly good name and call me a darn wife?

147
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,990
And,

148
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,470
how am I your wife?

149
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,610
We have already been divorced since last winter.

150
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,770
I wonder what belief makes you talk big?

151
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,450
Wait a minute,

152
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,560
you got all dressed up too.

153
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,340
Are you having

154
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,010
are you cheating on me?

155
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,210
Do you think you can really say whatever you want?

156
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,400
So, what if I'm having an affair?

157
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,340
It's true,

158
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,590
who in the right mind would pick up a used good like you?

159
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,280
Since it's me, I'm living with you.

160
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,520
What did you say?

161
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,680
Come inside immediately!

162
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,240
How can someone be so undignified and overflowing with low class?

163
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,400
There's no comparison to Oppa.

164
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,830
Aiyoo...

165
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,010
During the day, Se Yoon's mother wasn't feeling well.

166
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,360
At night, Mom isn't feeling well.

167
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,040
I don't know what is causing them to take turns being sick.

168
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,100
Instead of suffering like this,

169
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,100
just do as what I'm telling you to.

170
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,080
If you tell me where he's living, I'll immediately go and bring him here.

171
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,900
Bring who, Dad?

172
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,980
Huh?

173
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,750
Ah...

174
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:10,140
Well... To you, he would be your oppa.

175
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,210
Oppa?

176
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,720
Ah... Well...

177
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,870
Please...

178
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,560
Please stop.

179
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,850
What's wrong? Eventually Chae Won will know anyway.

180
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,060
The truth is, your Mother...

181
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,740
Please, just stop it already.

182
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,970
Alright.

183
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,140
<i>♫ Break away... Break away...</i>
<i>♫ Break away... Break away... Break away...</i>

184
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,050
<i>♫ Break away from my suffocating life.</i>

185
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,460
<i>♫ I'll take charge. I'll just run towards my future.</i>

186
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,760
<i>♫ I'll break away from my suffocating life.</i>

187
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,210
You did well. My husband is doing really well.

188
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,610
Thank you honey.

189
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,620
Here.

190
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,810
Let's stop for today. If your voice gets damaged by practicing too much, it will affect your recording.

191
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,610
No. Let's go at it one last time.

192
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,510
You're a practice addict.

193
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,770
This time, no matter what, I'll make a big hit. I'll provide well for my honey.

194
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll make sure you will hear, "Our last son-in-law is the best".

195
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,800
Even if you don't achieve success, you're still the best husband to me.

196
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,890
I want that good impression of me to remain with you for the rest of your life.

197
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,520
I'll do my best, okay?

198
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,910
Since you have made such a great impression on me,

199
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,360
it will never leave me. So, don't worry, Honey.

200
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Should I eat one more?

201
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,000
Have one more!

202
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,780
Mother!

203
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,100
Mother, mother. 
 Mother~ Mother~

204
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,850
Aigoo... Seriously, why are you all fired up?

205
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
Bam! An oath.

206
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,600
What is this?

207
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm going to send Chae Won a video, so take an oath with your right hand.

208
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,100
And take that off! You look like a ghost.

209
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,640
Why you!

210
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,760
Seriously, what is this out of the blue, in the middle of the night? Why an oath?

211
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,390
What is this?!

212
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,820
One. I, Bang Young Ja, will allow Min Chae Won to be my daughter-in-law again

213
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,470
and never make her do household chores.

214
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,100
Two. I, Bang Young Ja, will allow Min Chae Won and my son to move out of my house,

215
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,600
but in turn have them to visit me once a month.

216
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,420
I will never ask them for money.

217
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,970
Hey, what do you think you're doing with this?

218
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,870
If you make sure that you would never do the things you did in the past, then Chae Won would come back to me!

219
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,470
So you're making me take an oath?

220
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,880
Right now is a crucial juncture. If I can't get Chae Won to change her mind at this point,

221
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,640
then it'll be difficult forever.

222
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,130
What kind of juncture is the current juncture?

223
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,600
I can't tell you yet.

224
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Just cooperate, Mom.

225
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,760
Aiyoo, this is so disgusting and petty, seriously.

226
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,490
So, this old mom of yours...

227
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,190
Do you have to make me take an oath for you to get a wife?

228
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,760
If you don't want your only son to grow old alone, then...

229
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,660
Please help me, Mom!

230
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,550
Aiyoo, I'm sick of this. I'm so sick of this! Then, what do I have to do?

231
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,590
Raise your right hand,

232
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,630
and read everything honestly and sincerely.

233
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,020
Raise my right hand.

234
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,490
Then,

235
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,380
we will be taking the video!

236
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,000
Ready?

237
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,640
Action!

238
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,350
Hey,

239
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,760
they say no parent can defeat their children.

240
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,750
Anyway...

241
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,020
Whether it's day or night, whether he's asleep or awake,

242
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,370
whether he's sitting or standing, all he does is think about you.

243
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,390
I'm confirming Cheol Gyoo's devotion to you.

244
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:46,980
But, you're really something! At this point, you should listen to Cheol Gyu and come.

245
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,140
How long are you going to keep being stubborn like that? Are you going to make me to do something like this, right now?

246
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,640
C-c-cut! Mother!!

247
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,810
<i> Chae Won! My mom has something to tell you. Listen well! </i>

248
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,880
<i>Hello, Chae Won.</i>

249
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,930
<i> Oath. </i>

250
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,850
<i> One.</i>
 I, Bang Young Ja,

251
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,500
<i>upon having Min Chae Won as my daughter-in-law again,</i>

252
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,880
<i>also upon moving out, I'll never make her do </i>

253
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,220
<i> household chores. </i>

254
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,920
<i> Two. </i>

255
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,300
<i> I, Bang Young Ja, upon allowing Min Chae Won (and my son) to move out of my house,</i>

256
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,690
<i>once a month,</i>

257
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,690
<i>I request that they visit me without fail.</i>

258
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,720
<i>Financially, I will never...</i>

259
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,010
What now?

260
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,010
Oh, Honey.

261
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,600
What do you think you're doing?

262
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,450
What do you mean what am I doing? I've prepared a lot to perform this show for you.

263
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,430
Look here!

264
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,080
<i>The video recording I sent you, it took a lot for my mom to do that.</i>

265
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:21,340
This time, for sure, my mother has intentions of becoming the best mother-in-law in all of Korea!

266
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,980
<i> Do you have any pride? </i> 
 How long are you going to do this to a person who doesn't like it?

267
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,110
There isn't much left anymore.

268
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,970
Because Lee Se Yoon, that bastard, and you can't be together no matter what.

269
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,760
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,080
What I'm saying is,

271
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,430
it's not very attractive for a man to talk too easily.

272
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,460
Just wait a little longer.

273
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,140
Do you know

274
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,430
some secret that I don't know?

275
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,940
I can't say anything more. We're finished for today. That's it. Sleep well, Honey!

276
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,630
Hello, hello?!

277
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,640
What on earth is happening?

278
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,160
Why is she out here and not sleeping?

279
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,170
Really...

280
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:20,920
We spent 4 billion won on advertisement, and now you want to pump another 1 billion won?

281
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,330
If we make a good first impression, and raise the image of the product, we'll profit from this business.

282
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:34,370
You can't even make payments on the noodle factory, and you have to give promissory notes. Aren't you being too risky?

283
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,150
How could you speak like that when you look at the sales? Our noodle is a huge hit.

284
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,390
Of course, that's right. But, you're asking for a lot more than I expected.

285
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,580
Without doing a major restructuring, we can't catch up with Sunbae's company by just advertising in the noodle market.

286
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,360
We came this far, we can't back out now.

287
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,740
Alright.

288
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,100
I'll ask the financial advisor to look into getting a bank loan.

289
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,780
After we stole their new product, they are in chaos.

290
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,760
I'm going to crush Sunbae with this chance.

291
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,140
You said there was something urgent. What is it?

292
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,780
I was wondering if you can establish a technology partnership.

293
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,750
A technology partnership?

294
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,560
Yes.

295
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,290
I want to make Chae Won's noodle that won first place at the competition a premium product.

296
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,520
The noodles that I made?

297
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,970
Yes.

298
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,430
Since Chae Won's factory is small,

299
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,670
there is no way they can make the products we need.

300
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,990
So I hope to establish a technology partnership.

301
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,480
What's that?

302
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,900
If we establish this partnership, our company can produce noodles at other factories using Chae Won's technology.

303
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,410
In return, you'll be paid royalties from the sales of noodles made using Chae Won's technology.

304
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,440
This is like hitting the lottery.

305
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,280
Isn't it?

306
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,170
You're right.

307
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,310
I couldn't imagine us coming this far.

308
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,340
Let's sign.

309
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,720
Uh,

310
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,270
Madam your friend is here.

311
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,780
Should I open the door or not?

312
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,500
Which friend?

313
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,010
Open it.

314
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,040
Yes Madam.

315
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,040
Without calling first

316
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,310
what are you doing here?

317
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:58,240
I came because I had something to say to you.

318
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,040
Ajumma. Ajumma.

319
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,640
Yes Madam

320
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,340
Please go to the market.

321
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,740
Ah, yes.

322
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,150
I understand.

323
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,560
Have a seat Choon Hee.

324
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,680
Over the past days,

325
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,540
your face has gotten worse.

326
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,940
Think of me not getting crazy

327
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,400
and being fine in front of you as lucky.

328
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,620
I'm sorry.

329
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,850
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,050
If you found out the truth

331
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,430
I thought you would tell it to Se Yoon.

332
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,450
I thought that.

333
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,260
So you're thankful I kept my mouth shut.

334
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,620
Don't fool yourself.

335
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,330
I have no intention of keeping this to myself.

336
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,450
For whose benefit, do you think I should keep mouth closed?

337
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,880
When the blood in your entire body dries up

338
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,460
and your liver shrivels, I'll let it all out. I'm forcing myself to wait until then.

339
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,050
You should have felt the same thing to that extent.

340
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,930
It's no fun if you reveal everything so easily.

341
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,390
You

342
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,520
are really cruel.

343
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,320
Cruel?

344
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,730
Did you say I'm cruel?

345
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,830
You taking my child

346
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,040
and making my whole life a lie. Did you just say that I'm cruel?

347
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,850
Are you in the right mind?

348
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,020
Hello, Ahjummunim.

349
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,950
Ah, yes. Welcome.

350
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,580
Is mother...?

351
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,750
She's inside.

352
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,870
I'll be going to the market.

353
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,100
Yes. Have a safe trip.

354
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,900
Instead,

355
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
I tell everything to Se Yoon.

356
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,250
I don't think I can live like this any longer.

357
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,440
I lived like that for 30 years.

358
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,040
But, since you've been bothered over these couple of days,

359
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,810
you're complaining to me?

360
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,510
Choon Hee!

361
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm going to tell my son.

362
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,560
So Unnie you just keep your mouth shut.

363
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,080
<i> If there is reason that you two really can't be together</i>

364
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,220
<i> would you be able to give up on Seyoon?</i>

365
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,560
Of course, it's not like I don't know your heart.

366
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,770
If it's really for Se Yoon,

367
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,420
isn't it best to just skip over this?

368
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,250
What?!

369
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,780
If Se Yoon finds out that you're his real mother,

370
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,230
then Se Yoon and Chae Won wouldn't be able to get married.

371
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,320
If it becomes like this,

372
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,680
it'll become a scar on each of them.

373
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,850
Even though Se Yoon is still your son,

374
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,580
Chae Won is still your daughter.

375
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,380
Anyways,

376
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,460
no one can follow your head.

377
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,750
You're saying that I should keep this a secret in front of Chae Won?

378
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,990
That's not what I meant, Choon Hee!

379
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,300
Don't get mad and listen to what I'm going to say.

380
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,360
I'm not saying to keep this a secret from your daughter.

381
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,510
This is my decision after thinking about it over the days.

382
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,110
This is your final decision that you've been thinking?!

383
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,560
Se Yoon being your son

384
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,580
is revealed, what exactly do you want returned to you?

385
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,940
Is there any more to this than giving your children scars?

386
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,480
You really have no shame.

387
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,620
So, what you're saying is,

388
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,880
I should let my innocent child that was taken away from me

389
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,850
call you mother for the rest of his life?

390
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,580
Look here.

391
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,950
If you don't like me being around Se Yoon, then I'll secretly go to America.

392
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,380
I'll go to America.

393
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,140
You can just live with Se Yoon, Choon Hee!

394
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,500
Stop saying this like that!

395
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,850
Don't get mad!

396
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,720
Don't get mad, Choon Hee, and talk reasonably.

397
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,350
Think about it reasonably!

398
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,820
Stop saying such nonsense!

399
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,640
No matter what it takes, I'll get my son!

400
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,200
So,

401
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
stop having such unnecessary hope!

402
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,130
Chae Won...

403
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,930
When did you get here?

404
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,810
I'm sorry. I'll be leaving first.

405
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,150
Chae Won... Chae Won

406
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,130
Now...

407
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,170
Now it's all over.

408
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,880
It's all over now!

409
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,650
It's all over now!

410
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,970
Chae Won! Chae Won!

411
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,890
Chae Won!

412
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,160
Talk with me for a moment.

413
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,080
You've been really surprised, right?

414
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,120
Are you alright?

415
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,100
Towards Mom,

416
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,150
I was thinking what was wrong.

417
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,520
Ah, how can this be.

418
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,880
How can this happen?

419
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,270
I'm sorry.

420
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,450
Since I was stupid,

421
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,510
something like this happened.

422
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,910
I... I can't believe this.

423
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,720
This is impossible!

424
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,190
Chae Won!

425
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,070
Chae Won...

426
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,290
Chae Won, wait a minute.

427
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,500
I'm here!

428
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,100
This person, really!

429
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,320
How can you just walk in by yourself?

430
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,290
I called you, but you didn't pick up,

431
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,310
so I came.

432
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,180
I must have not heard it because the machine was on.

433
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,750
But, what are you doing here?

434
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,560
Did someone stop by?

435
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,520
Yes.

436
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,690
A courier is here, Mother-in-law.

437
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,700
You can't keep on coming here like this!

438
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,570
If Seul Hong's dad and Bo Reum's dad find out, you won't have intact bones.

439
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,130
If they find out the whole truth, they will be on my side anyway.

440
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,260
It's an absolute secret.

441
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,750
Shh..

442
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,840
By the way, Mother-in-law hasn't said anything yet?

443
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,810
What kind of words?

444
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,270
What do you mean what kind of words?

445
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,580
She should declare, "Lee Se Yoon is my son".

446
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,440
What if others hear you?

447
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,900
Be careful with your mouth, please!

448
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,880
Yes... Yes.

449
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,350
But,

450
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,280
Seriously!

451
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,440
When the time comes, there will one or two huge commotions.

452
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,340
You just have to wait a little.
 Why are you being so impatient?

453
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,370
I think it's because I feeling a little impatient.

454
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,610
I'm ready to get back with Chae Won anytime.

455
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,860
I only trust you.

456
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,110
Why do you keep on doing this?
I feel burdened.

457
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,190
The only person on my side from this household

458
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,410
is you, Aunty.

459
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,600
Ah... This mouth...

460
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,140
brings me awful luck.

461
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,410
I don't know why I told you. I'm being tormented by you, seriously.

462
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,860
Look...

463
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:06,890
The fact that Chae Won's mom is Se Yoon's biological mother, you absolutely cannot

464
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,280
tell anyone, huh?

465
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,290
Okay.

466
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,610
Please don't worry. Even though I look like this,

467
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,270
I can really keep my mouth shut.

468
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,390
<i>I heard the news of your marriage and I cried for 3 days and 2 nights straight.</i>

469
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,710
<i>After I got dumped by you,</i>

470
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,950
<i>I gritted my teeth and tried my best.</i>

471
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,320
<i>I succeeded.</i>

472
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,050
It's clear he hasn't been able to forget me until this day.

473
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,510
If he didn't have other motives towards me,

474
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,610
there's no reason why he would've treated me to the steak and wine dinner.

475
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,020
He even escorted me home at night,

476
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,360
Eeek, you surprised me.

477
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,910
Don't you know how to knock?

478
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,670
Is there a moron who'd knock on his own door?

479
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,020
What's this?

480
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,810
What did you do that makes you fall back from a surprise?

481
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,520
You're

482
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,710
hiding something from me aren't you?

483
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,700
Wha... Wha.. What could I be hiding?

484
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,940
Without my knowledge,

485
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,930
did you hide some emergency fund?

486
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,440
I'd say your class is...

487
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,550
If not, never mind.

488
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,380
It's been a while

489
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,460
since I dressed in suit for work, I felt so stifled.

490
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,170
I'm coming back from contracting re technical collaboration with Se Yoon's company.

491
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,540
Um hm.

492
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,490
Every time a noodle that's been made from our company gets sold,

493
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,720
we're going to receive a royalty.

494
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,600
What is this darn wife thinking about?

495
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,070
Bo Reum's Mom

496
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,400
Huh?

497
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,530
What?!

498
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,660
Nothing.

499
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,380
filled with a note~ (musical note)

500
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,700
if I close both eyes~ (singing to himself)

501
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,290
<i>♫ I came into this world with nothing, and I'll leave with nothing.</i>

502
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,140
<i>♫ I have nothing to lose.</i>

503
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,780
<i>♫ Break away...Break away...</i>
<i>♫Break away... Break away... Break away.</i>

504
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,120
<i>♫ I'll break away from my suffocating life.</i>

505
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,900
<i>♫ I'll take charge. I'll just run towards my future.</i>

506
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,920
<i>♫ I'll break away from my suffocating life.</i>

507
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,290
Wait a moment!

508
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,740
Why is the condition of your voice like this?

509
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,240
I told you not to sing at the club until the recording was over.

510
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,540
He didn't go to the club.

511
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,330
What 's wrong with his voice?

512
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,160
He must have over did while practicing last night.

513
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,730
Can we start over again after I feed him a raw egg?

514
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,180
That's fine.

515
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,740
Let's take a little break.

516
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,220
Yes.

517
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,300
Are you okay?

518
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,330
Would you like another?

519
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,200
You two have such a harmonious relationship.

520
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,520
How did you meet?

521
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,330
I am her first love.

522
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,820
Ahhhh...

523
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,580
first love

524
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,980
My first love is your sister in law.

525
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
My sister in law?

526
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,110
Yes, Gong Kang Sook .

527
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,390
When I was in high school, she was my first love.

528
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,170
Who is Gong Kang Sook?

529
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,070
That's Bo Reum's mom.

530
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,370
Bo Reum's mom..? Ha!

531
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,070
Hah!

532
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,350
President.

533
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,240
You have a unique preference.

534
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,460
How can you like that bulldog like...ooof

535
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,680
I had a date with her yesterday.

536
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,640
We had dinner and

537
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,230
a glass of wine.

538
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,710
You had a date with her?!

539
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,090
Aigoo,

540
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:05,120
how can you taking up space on the floor when the weather is so nice?

541
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,280
Perhaps you can go to the senior center and play chess or

542
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,150
have a drink with friends or

543
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,820
Aren't you bored stuck in the room all day?

544
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,490
Never mind.

545
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,460
To mind not,

546
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,240
I don't think we can leave it like this anymore. Let's go to the hospital tomorrow.

547
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,480
Why the hospital?

548
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,960
Aigoo, each day your condition seems to worsen

549
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,480
I have a feeling that something may be wrong.

550
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,160
I'm perfectly fine so you need not concern yourself

551
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,530
but what are you going to do about our last daughter?

552
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,690
Ai, don't even bring up Ki Ok's story.

553
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,480
She fell over heels over that old gigolo and dropped her mother, father,

554
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,810
and siblings like old shoes, a world's most wicked wench.

555
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,250
They've even registered their marriage already,

556
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,500
there's nothing we can do about it now.

557
00:34:53,530 --> 00:35:00,590
What what? You were bouncing off the wall with anger over it but suddenly got a weaker resolve?

558
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,950
Since it's impossible to put back spilled milk and,

559
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,270
we should consider it all her fate.

560
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,130
What can we do at this juncture?

561
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,320
I can't do that even if the dirt covers my eyes (=die)

562
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,270
I cannot accept an old gigolo as my son-in-law.

563
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:47,600
Does dad not know yet?

564
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,810
Yes.

565
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,030
He just knows that I have a son,

566
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,920
The fact that Se Yoon is my son

567
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,980
he does not know yet.

568
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,080
I see.

569
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,300
Chae Won,

570
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,030
If

571
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,490
If mom,

572
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,840
I reveal that Se Yoon's my son,

573
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,290
If mom does that,

574
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,600
Chae Won you and Se Yoon would be

575
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,810
Is that the

576
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,560
only way left for you, mom?

577
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,430
Is that the only way?

578
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,410
I'm so scared.

579
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,510
Chae Won,

580
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,340
But

581
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,740
Se Yoon is to you, mom, the only blood relation,

582
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,900
I'm sorry Chae Won.

583
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,450
Mom is in this way,

584
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,600
was about to block your future...that I didn't know.

585
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,790
I'm really sorry, Chae Won.

586
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,550
I'm sorry.

587
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,620
<i>Se Yoon calling</i>

588
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,380
Is it Se Yoon?

589
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,120
Pick up quickly.

590
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,990
Yes, hello.

591
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,700
Where are you?

592
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:50,550
I'm taking a walk with mom, why?

593
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,490
I think we have to go to the factory together.

594
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,190
Since you Chae Won are the one who's developed the noodle,

595
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,040
I would like you to check the noodle yourself.

596
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,400
Right now?

597
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,490
Get in.

598
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,410
This here is the person who developed the Premium Noodle, Min Chae Won.

599
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,730
How are you?

600
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,890
We used the ingredients you sent and produced the first proto-type sample.

601
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,720
Good work. Let's go then.

602
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,860
What are you thinking so hard about?

603
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,480
Chae Won!

604
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
What?

605
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,420
You've been close-mouthed since our trip back from the factory,

606
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,520
why are you so quiet?

607
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,840
Is something the matter?

608
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,470
No, ah...

609
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,400
Nothing's the matter.

610
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,080
Se Yoon

611
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,100
Mom...

612
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,330
likes you Se Yoon very much.

613
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,960
I know.

614
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,690
When your mom looks at me, many heart shapes (like emoji heart = affection) come through her eyes.

615
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,210
Ai, what's this expression? You're making the person who was joking embarrassed.

616
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,310
Ah, by the way,

617
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,120
your mother's son that I mentioned about before,

618
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,040
Mom's

619
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,870
son?

620
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,730
I heard he went to heaven as soon as he was born at the maternity clinic.

621
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,000
So, I heard your mom had a very difficult time.

622
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,410
Your mother said that?

623
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,800
No,

624
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,020
my father told me that.

625
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,310
He was born at the same maternity clinic with me

626
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,860
on the same date,

627
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,080
so every time your mom sees me,

628
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,900
it looked as though she was reminded of her son.

629
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,750
If I marry Chae Won, then I'm going to act her son's role as well.

630
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,710
I promise.

631
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,860
I'm here, Mother.

632
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,200
Welcome.

633
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:46,060
I came here from the factory, so I didn't have anything to eat.

634
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,110
Please feed me, Mother.

635
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,260
Oh.

636
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,660
Of course.

637
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,950
I'll feed you. Just wait a little, ok?

638
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,520
You came?

639
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,510
Yes.

640
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,300
I came over to eat dinner.

641
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,430
You're really reducing the amount of rice we have.

642
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,990
You need to buy and bring us a sack of rice.

643
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,470
Okay, I'll do that.

644
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,690
First, I'll greet Grandpa and Grandma.

645
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,120
Grandpa and Grandma, I came!

646
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,270
Chae Won, are you sick?

647
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,570
Excuse me?

648
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,170
What's wrong with your face?

649
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,530
It's nothing.

650
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,100
I'll be back after I get changed upstairs.

651
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,310
<i>I came this far with much difficulty.</i>

652
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,650
<i>What do I do now?</i>

653
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,590
It's soybean paste stew again?

654
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,710
I'm sorry.

655
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,820
I only know how to make soybean paste stew.

656
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,630
Ah, it's alright.

657
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,580
It's really good for you.

658
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,970
It's sweet pickled radish.

659
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,040
We ran out of Kimchi.

660
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm sorry.

661
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,600
It's alright.

662
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,270
Since it's been a while, I'm happy to have sweet pickled radish.

663
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,490
Let's hurry and eat.

664
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,240
Is it salty?

665
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,690
It's alright.
 We just have to add more water.

666
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,720
Uh!

667
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,210
It's perfectly seasoned now.

668
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,320
Here... You too.

669
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,800
Ah!

670
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,000
It's more delicious because my honey fed me.

671
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,710
You guys are having fun.

672
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,270
Oh... You didn't even call.
What brings you...

673
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,240
Why don't you come over here and join us?

674
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,690
Okay?

675
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,460
What are these side dishes?

676
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,430
Ah, why do we need side dishes?

677
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,640
I look at my wife's face once, and then, I eat a spoonful rice.

678
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,420
I eat a spoonful of rice, and then, if I look at my wife's face, I'm full.

679
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,770
You're stupid... stupid... totally stupid.

680
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,970
How could you talk like that in this situation?

681
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,190
Our father and mother are ill, and they're in bed.

682
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,090
I didn't think through.
I'm sorry.

683
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,800
Seriously.

684
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,780
Why did you come here again?
Why are you tormenting him?

685
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,440
We didn't come here to torment him.

686
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,250
We brought some dry side dishes and kimchi.

687
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,140
Here.

688
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,990
Ah, it's radish kimchi!
How long has it been?

689
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,220
Ah! Seriously!

690
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,440
Do you think we got all these ready and came here in the middle of the night to feed you, Rootop?

691
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,030
We brought these here because we were worried that our miss will suffer from malnutrition.

692
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,060
You, Rooftop, don't touch any of these side dishes.

693
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,440
Are you going to be petty like that with food, seriously?

694
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,710
It's alright, Honey.
It's alright.

695
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,180
Honey, you enjoy, ok?

696
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,830
That word, "Honey"... Ah!

697
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,900
It gives me the creeps.

698
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,350
If you are going to be like this, I can get aggressive.

699
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,210
What do you mean, aggressive?

700
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,700
Kang Bong Soo of Sugar Entertainment.

701
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,700
Who is that person?

702
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,720
That person is...

703
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,420
uh...

704
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,470
The company that I got the recording contract with...

705
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,640
He's the president of the company.

706
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,470
Please chew slowly and eat a lot.

707
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,670
This side dish too.

708
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,480
Chae Won doesn't feel like eating because her stomach doesn't feel well.

709
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,100
Her stomach doesn't feel well?

710
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,100
How come?

711
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,100
I think she got motion sickness.

712
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,660
The whole time we were coming home from the factory, she seemed to be suffering.

713
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:20,930
By any chance,

714
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,430
did anything happen earlier?

715
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,220
What thing...?

716
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,380
The soup is getting cold. Hurry and eat.

717
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,860
Okay. I'll enjoy it, Mother.

718
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,300
Eh...

719
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,480
Since you're staring at me like that, it's too embarrassing for me to eat.

720
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,800
Oh...

721
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,940
I'm sorry.

722
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,240
You feel like you're full just watching your son-in-law eat, right, Mother-in-law?

723
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,550
Right. That's right.

724
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,280
The side dishes suit your taste?

725
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,330
I'm sorry, Mother.

726
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:16,080
Since I lost my sense of taste, I honestly don't know how they taste.

727
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,300
I know you prepared them diligently.

728
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,260
I'm sorry.

729
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,630
Why are you being like that, Mother?

730
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,940
Sorry.

731
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,690
It's alright.

732
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,580
How did you...

733
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,900
How did you lose your sense of taste?

734
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,350
What was so difficult?

735
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:51,770
At that time, the shock I got was too much for me.

736
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,770
After meeting Chae Won, I have recovered a lot from my emotional wounds.

737
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:02,210
The awful memories I thought I would never forget,

738
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,370
I was able to forget them.

739
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,080
They said if I become emotionally stable, then my sense of taste will return naturally.

740
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,050
So, you don't need to worry.

741
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:17,100
Chae Won is helping me a lot by my side also.

742
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,360
Does your stomach feel a little better now?

743
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,980
Yes.

744
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,960
It's alright.

745
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,120
When we are married, let's have as many children as possible, ok?

746
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,560
Since my mom grew up alone, she always wanted a lot of grand kids.

747
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,790
Mother would feel the same way, right?

748
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:57,450
You must be tired from walking around the factory all day.

749
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,100
Have a good rest.

750
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,110
I'll get going.

751
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:18,680
<i>♫ I can't love you?</i>

752
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,860
<i>♫ I can't get closer to you?</i>

753
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,990
<i>♫ Do we grow apart if I love you?</i>

754
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:31,350
<i>♫ I can't get one step closer to you.</i>

755
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,870
<i>♫ I can't forget you.</i>

756
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:37,140
<i>♫ I'm stopped at the same place.</i>

757
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:43,160
<i>If Mom reveals the fact that Se Yoon is my son,</i>

758
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,780
<i>then you and Se Yoon...</i>

759
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:55,350
<i>♫ How did I come to love you?</i>

760
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:59,380
<i>♫ My longing for you becomes more unbearable.</i>

761
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,830
<i>♫ I can't bear to forget you.</i>

762
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:10,620
<i>♫ I still only love you.</i>

763
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:21,230
<i>♫ I'll love you as long as I live.</i>

764
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:26,450
I'm back.

765
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,050
Are you coming back from

766
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,200
Chae Won's house?

767
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,180
Yes.

768
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,100
Mother made dinner for me.

769
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,800
Alright.

770
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,750
That was good.

771
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,890
I was running around all day long to endorse the new product, so I'm very tired.

772
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,620
Go to sleep, Mom.

773
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,570
Se Yoon.

774
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,860
Mom...

775
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,480
Can you give me a hug?

776
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,940
There is nothing going on, right Mom?

777
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,170
What could be going on?

778
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,270
I just want to be hugged by my son for once.

779
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,170
I think you're losing weight, more and more.

780
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,900
You're smaller than before, Mom.

781
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,590
Mom...

782
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,240
loves you. You know that, right Son?

783
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,190
Of course.

784
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,880
Later on,

785
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,030
no matter how much you hate me,

786
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,720
the fact that

787
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:30,120
I loved you,

788
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,280
don't ever forget that.

789
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,630
Why would I hate you?

790
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,550
That will never happen.

791
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,470
<i>If they find out you are Se Yoon's biological mother,</i>

792
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,120
<i>Se Yoon &amp; Chae Won's wedding will become naught,</i>

793
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,060
<i>then</i>

794
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,510
<i>that will inevitably hurt the kids,</i>

795
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:11,530
<i>as Se Yoon is your son isn't Chae Won also your daughter?</i>

796
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,050
<i>I'm very scared.</i>

797
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,770
<i>But</i>

798
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,880
<i>Se Yoon is the only blood relative to mom.</i>

799
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,780
<i>How did you come to lose your sense of taste? Just what was so stressful?</i>

800
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,720
<i>I was back then so psychologically shocked.</i>

801
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,200
<i>Since I met Chae Won, the wound in my heart has healed a lot.</i>

802
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:44,200
<i>I've come to forget terrible memories which I didn't think possible to ever forget.</i>

803
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,080
Why is it always

804
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,800
Why

805
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:57,420
I am the only one who has to have everything taken away from me?

806
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,700
I don't like it. I don't want to have things taken away from me.

807
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,410
But,

808
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,510
if I alone make the sacrifice, then my son and daughter will both be happy.

809
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,170
If I'm the mom,

810
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,980
If I'm really my son's mom...

811
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,060
So pretty, my daughter.

812
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,110
Why don't you say anything?

813
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,670
Could it be that you don't like it?

814
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,900
What do you say at a time like this, mother?

815
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,630
I don't think plain "pretty" reflects even a 100th of my feelings.

816
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,590
I don't know what to say.

817
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,720
You look beautiful, Chae Won.

818
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:44,630
Among all the brides this mom has seen, you're the most beautiful.

819
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:52,280
Now, let's take a commemorative photo with a cell phone.

820
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,280
Look this way.

821
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,520
Right,

822
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,050
One, two, three...

823
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,990
What is it?

824
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,420
Se Yoon has

825
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,340
sent the photo so I saw.

826
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,950
Chae Won's wedding dress look so good on her.

827
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,460
I think you're mistaken about something

828
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,780
I don't feel at ease enough to converse with you on the phone.

829
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,980
I know.

830
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:42,010
I just couldn't stand to see the blood tears flowing from my kids,

831
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:45,040
so I figure that it'd all be over if I could just shut my one mouth,

832
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,450
so I decided to bury everything, but

833
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:50,670
I cannot forgive you until I die.

834
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:52,180
I know.

835
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,480
Why wouldn't I know that?

836
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,940
Really,

837
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,630
thank you, Choon Hee.

838
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,860
I didn't do this to get your gratitude so shove it.

839
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,630
What's this?

840
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,810
Come in!

841
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,470
Wow, what brings you here, aunt-in-law?

842
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,660
Uh, right. I had something really urgent to discuss with you.

843
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:43,950
If you have something to say, all you had to do is call. And I'd have driven to you at the speed of a bullet.

844
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,090
Why don't you sit down anyway, please?

845
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,930
Here, take a seat over here, please.
Oh, right.

846
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,910
What would you like to drink? Refreshing green iced tea or juice or water?

847
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:03,380
Oh, no, no, no. I just came by to return something so as soon as I return it I'll be on my way.

848
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,140
Why is this, once again...?

849
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:12,060
I think it's really all over so

850
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,520
Let me return it to you.

851
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,310
All over? What is?

852
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,070
Our Chae Won just set the date to marry Se Yoon.

853
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,850
WH-A-A-T?

854
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,450
What are you saying?

855
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:28,170
I had a lot of work to do lately so I couldn't pay closer attention to this. Has something happened in that short time?

856
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:31,280
How can those two get married?

857
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,260
Chae Won's mom decided to bury everything.

858
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:40,410
For Chae Won and Se Yoon's happiness, she decided to "I'll sacrifice myself", Baek Uyi Jong Goon (general as commoner).

859
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:44,540
What kind of rule is this? It can't be this!

860
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:50,030
Now the bus has left (=missed the opportunity), so Kim hubby you too should give up on our Chae Won and

861
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,690
meet a nice woman and start anew.

862
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,670
I can't never do that.

863
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:57,300
I can't do that!

864
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,750
Aiyoo, look at all this flour dust.

865
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:09,000
It's almost time the guests will be arriving so go and freshen up and return soon.

866
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,650
I'm sorry, mom.

867
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,840
I feel so brazen and sorry so

868
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:21,300
I can't even thank you.

869
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

870
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,880
If you both are happy then I'm happy too.

871
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,180
I don't have any further desire.

872
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,420
I'm sorry.

873
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,040
Aiyoo, Ajumma! Bring me some headache medicine.

874
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:53,650
Aiyoo, all day at work, I labored over annoying company trouble, I feel as though my head will explode!

875
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:57,360
Yes, Chairman. 
Aigoo, no way!

876
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,540
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

877
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:05,130
It's been lapsed for a while so I was curious. Why did you swill again?

878
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,430
In the world,

879
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:11,140
How in the world, can something like this happen, mom?

880
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,790
What is it again?

881
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,310
Yi Se Yoon that bastard you know

882
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,940
finally is going to marry our Chae Won. They have set the date.

883
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,850
They set the date?

884
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,830
I just cannot understand it.

885
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:31,230
Ai, what's there to understand? The two like each other and would like to marry.

886
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:34,150
Hey hey Chul Gyu, you too switch off your concern!

887
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,600
I mean, how can SIBLINGS

888
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,160
can marry each other?

889
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,810
Siblings get married? Who?

890
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:46,440
That bastard, Lee Se Yoon's biological mother is

891
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:48,130
Chae Won's mom.

892
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:51,290
What? What did you say?!

893
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,210
You must had a difficult time making such a long journey.

894
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:03,430
Not really. Thank you for inviting us.

895
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,570
You've been well, right?

896
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,080
Of course.

897
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,950
You have been well too, right?

898
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:12,560
Yes. Thanks to you.

899
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:23,540
Now...

900
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,470
Let's start eating since you must be hungry.

901
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:53,390
There's not much, but please enjoy.

902
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:57,780
This is a feast, Elder. We'll enjoy.

903
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,000
Madam, you enjoy too.

904
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,380
Okay, thank you.

905
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,150
Hey, Chae Won's mom!

906
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,350
Yes... did you call me?

907
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:13,640
You eat with us.
What are you doing?

908
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,870
Yes. Join us, Mom.

909
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:20,950
Oh, I... have some work to do in the kitchen.

910
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,540
Please enjoy, Brother-in-law.

911
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,400
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

912
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,570
<i>Aunty!</i>

913
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:38,110
That... that...
Is this guy crazy?

914
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,830
Who are you to barge in like this?!

915
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:45,230
I'm sorry for ruining such a good atmosphere.

916
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,310
Uhuh! Won't you get out immediately?!

917
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,600
I'll send him away.

918
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,780
No, you stay put.

919
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:54,640
-Hey, Ki Choon.
-Hyung. Let's go out.

920
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,270
-Please just let go of me!
-This man...

921
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,580
Omo! This guy must be crazy!

922
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:06,700
Let's go out. First, let's go out and talk, Son-in-law Kim. Let's go out!

923
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,220
This marriage...

924
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,990
absolutely cannot happen!

925
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,780
Even though they don't share a drop of blood,

926
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:29,090
they are still siblings.
 How can they marry?

927
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:50,160
<i>♫ Living like this is not living.</i>

928
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:57,290
<i>♫ How did I come to love you?</i>

929
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:03,760
<i>♫ My longing becomes unbearable.</i>
<i>♫ I can't bear to forget you.</i>

930
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:14,240
<i>♫ I still only love you.</i>

931
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,060
<i>♫ I can't forget you even for a moment.</i>
