00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:08,303
Uhm... what's happening right now?

2
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:10,905
Max, are you smoking crack?

3
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:14,205
It's not crack. It's lipstick.
I can't afford crack.

4
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:17,103
I'm at the end of my good
lipstick and I can't afford

5
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:19,739
to buy a new one
so I'm going all <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

6
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,190
<i>"Breaking Bad"?</i>

7
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:23,109
We're more like broke and sad.

8
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:25,745
You're freebasing
lipstick and look,

9
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:27,897
this heel is starting to wobble.

10
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,416
Here, stick this in
and hold it.

11
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:31,868
I swear I've said that before,

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,487
but I don't think
it was about shoes.

13
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:37,573
Yo, dollface.
It's been ten minutes!

14
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:40,743
His chowder, my spaghetti.
Where's the food?

15
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:41,894
"Where's the food"?

16
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:44,580
Where's your neck?

17
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:48,084
I wasn't listening.
I was looking at your boobs.

18
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:49,602
Well, I do what I can
but they'll never be

19
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:52,138
as big as yours.

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,923
Pick up.
Meatball.

21
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:57,894
Hey, hot stuff.
Where's the hot stuff?

22
00:00:57,896 --> 00:00:59,178
Oh, Max.
You were right.

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,646
This heel is
much more--no.

24
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:01,781
No, wait!
No, it's not.

25
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,199
It's gonna--

26
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:06,903
Those are the biggest balls
those guys have had

27
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:09,622

they started steroids.

I can't believe you masking
taped the shoe to your leg.

33
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:33,815
I know but these are
Christian Louboutins and

34
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:35,766
even all busted up like
this they still have

35
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:37,819
the classic red bottoms.

has red bottoms?

Baboons.

Walk around with a couple
of them on your feet

39
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,909
and I'm impressed.

40
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,594
Well, at least now you can't
see those stupid bows.

41
00:01:46,596 --> 00:01:48,997
Who put bows on their shoes?
What's the gift?

42
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:50,798
Your stinky feet?

43
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,383
You don't think
I hate the bows?

44
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,619
I bought these as an impulse
purchase over a year ago.

45
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,287
I didn't know I'd be shackled
with them for eternity.

46
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:59,607
[Knock at door]

47
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,681
Oh, Caroline.

48
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:09,400
I never noticed
you had a club foot.

49
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:13,071
I would have set you up
with my brother.

50
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:15,189
I broke my shoe in the diner.

51
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,274
Oh, I can help.

52
00:02:16,276 --> 00:02:19,994
I always carry
my gym shoes in my bag.

53
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:21,663
I'm sorry they're
so conservative

54
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:24,315
but the weight room
is a real meat rack.

55
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:25,833
Sophie, that's
so sweet of you.

56
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:28,486
But I still have one pair
of my own shoes to wear.

57
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,255
Oh, well take
them just in case.

58
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,372
You should take them.

59
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:33,958
You'll make $20
just walking to work.

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,461
And some of your mail
got mixed in with mine.

61
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:38,496
This is like the third time
that mail lady did that.

62
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:41,582
All right.
Nighty night.

63
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:46,287
Max, you will not believe
what just came addressed to you.

64
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:48,306
Let me explain.
I'm not a scientologist.

65
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:49,941
I just went that one time
because I heard

66
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:52,026
some rich guy was
looking for a wife.

67
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:55,229
No, we've been pre-approved
for a credit card.

68
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,281
What?

69
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:57,615
How the hell did
we get pre-approved?

70
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:59,817
It says all we have to do
is go online and apply

71
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,438
and we can be approved
in under two minutes.

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,908
Slow down, Quasimodo.
I can't have a credit card.

73
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,193
Someone gave me a bag of
Chips Ahoy! cookies once

74
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:11,579
and I ate the entire thing
without breathing.

75
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:12,830
Well, you're not
a child any more.

76
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:14,499
You have more discipline.

77
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,919
The cookies were yesterday.

78
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,421
Okay, what is that thing?
What is that spinning wheel?

79
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:22,423
It's just processing
our application.

80
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,591
No, it's not.

81
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,259
It's finding out
everything about us.

82
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:27,979
Now it's finding out your dad
stole millions of dollars.

83
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:30,932
Now it's finding out I got fired
from eight Dairy Queens.

84
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:34,986
Now it's finding out why I got
fired from eight Dairy Queens.

85
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:36,738
Oh, my God.
Max, we're approved.

86
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,189
We've just been approved.

87
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:41,943
What? What is wrong with them?
Does Dairy Queen report nothing?

88
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:44,061
Get back on there
and disapprove us.

89
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:45,563
Okay.
Calm down.

90
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:47,348
We need this card
for our business.

91
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,200
All we have to do is
communicate with each other

92
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:50,368
about every purchase,
you know?

93
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,120
Keep an open dialogue.

94
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:55,573
So, opening dialogue.
For our business,

95
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,425
I would like
a pair of Louboutins.

96
00:03:57,427 --> 00:04:00,244
Opening dialogue.
No.

97
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:03,598
And I felt stupid miming that.
I hate the arts.

98
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,384
Look, you can't get
everything you want.

99
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:08,469
I would like a box of lizards.

100
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:10,388
Love lizards, always have,

101
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,440
but you don't see me
putting that on a credit card.

102
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,759
I need a new pair of shoes
for business meetings.

103
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:15,977
You know what they say,

104
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:18,363
"dress for the job you want,
not the job you have".

105
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:20,097
Okay, fine.

106
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:22,150
If you're getting the shoes,
then I'm getting what I want.

107
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:23,768
I hope you're happy
with an apartment

108
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,486
full of lizards and lipstick.

109
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:29,440
Also, some of those lizards
will be wearing lipstick.

110
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:35,329
Earl, you are looking
particularly gorgeous

111
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:36,631
this evening.

112
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,583
Well, I would say,
"don't flatter me"

113
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:40,084
but let's face it.

114
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:42,670
Everything came
together tonight.

115
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:45,423
Is it another woman?
Should I be filled with anger?

116
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,558
I mean,
more than I usually am?

117
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,445
I just want to look nice
for my son when he comes in.

118
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:53,014
What? No way,
I'm going to meet your kid?

119
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:55,633
Well, one of them.

120
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,435
"One of them"?
How many do you have?

121
00:04:57,437 --> 00:05:00,238
So far?

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,906
Oh, Earl, I love you.

123
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,074
This is my son, Darius.

124
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:05,109
He's the number one
Chrysler salesman

125
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:08,196
in all of Detroit,
and he's my very favorite,

126
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:11,866
if he's the one
I'm thinking of.

127
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:15,269
Excuse me, but aren't you Max

128
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:18,673
of Max's Homemade Cupcakes?

129
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:19,791
Earl, look.

130
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:21,342
Our credit card came
in the mail today.

131
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:22,877
See?
"Max Black".

132
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,264
No more using the card
I found at Six Flags.

133
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:32,970
Thank you for never checking
your statement, Agnes Chin.

134
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:34,388
Girls, take my advice

135
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,357
and be very careful
with that thing.

136
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,975
Credit cards are more trouble

137
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:41,112
than a priest
at a Wiggles concert.

138
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:42,847
Both: Yes, Earl.

139
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,900
I can't believe it.
A credit card for our business.

140
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:48,035
So when are we getting
the shoes and lizards?

141
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:49,337
Max, remember.

142
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,988
We have to be grown-ups
about this.

143
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,340
Of course.

144
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:57,695
"Two lizards, please.
No, make it three."

145
00:05:57,697 --> 00:05:59,831
Hi, I'm looking for Earl.

146
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,850
And no, I'm not here to return
a bag of skunky weed.

147
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:06,203
Oh, my God.
I'm so excited to see you.

148
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:08,656
Come on in, I'll take really,
really good care of you.

149
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:11,375
Oh, you need to know I just
separated from my wife,

150
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:14,044
so I'm a little vulnerable.

151
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:16,213
She's not usually
this nice to customers.

152
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:17,381
She's just excited.

153
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:20,017
She's about to come
into some lizards.

154
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:24,405
Yeah, again.

155
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:26,190
I've been out
the dating pool for a while,

156
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:30,578
so everything sound like
a sexual innuendo to me.

157
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,030
He is not a customer.
Look at him.

158
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,733
Don't you see the resemblance?

159
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:41,672
Oh, my God is he your father?

160
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,425
Yes.
He's my father.

161
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:47,128
And my mother is
a piece of chalk.

162
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:50,431
Daddy!

163
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,266
Thank God, it is
the one I thought.

164
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:54,835
There's my little boy!
[Laughter]

165
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,980
So, Darius, what was
Earl like as a dad?

166
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:05,064
It must have been great, huh?

167
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,816
I bet he packed
the coolest lunches.

168
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:09,903
A joint for recess,
and a gin and juice box.

169
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,455
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He was a great dad.

170
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:15,575
I mean, he was always there.
Except for my childhood.

171
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:17,243
[Laughs]

172
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:19,662
You've gotta laugh!

173
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:22,815
Earl is sitting right there.

174
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:27,119
Well, it's a joke.
Take it easy there, fun size.

175
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,637
Han, take no offense.

176
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,422
He's just pulling
your leg a little.

177
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:32,391
Darius has always been funny.

178
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:34,727
Why am I thinking
about Terrence?

179
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:36,228
I don't know.
I'm the funny one, Dad.

180
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,630
I don't recall there being
a Terrence in our family,

181
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:41,901
but then again, I don't know
how far you've thrown your seed.

182
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:43,102
[Laughs]

183
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:44,853
You've gotta laugh.

184
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,772
Do you?

185
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,691
Darius was voted
the funniest salesman

186
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:50,659
at the Chrysler dealership.

187
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,028
Yes, I was.
And that's why I quit my job.

188
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,331
To pursue my dream
to become a comedian.

189
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,584
[Laughs]

190
00:07:58,586 --> 00:08:00,369
See?
See, he's funny.

191
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:02,037
Always making jokes.

192
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,956
That's not a joke, Daddy.

193
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,208
No, no,
that's why I'm in town.

194
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,794
To audition at the comedy club
tomorrow night.

195
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:10,713
I already got my stage name.

196
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:13,799
"Darius The Hilarious".

197
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,434
I think
it's a good choice, right?

198
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:19,004
Is it?

199
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:21,857
Well, obviously, Big D,
we will all be there

200
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,175
to support you.

201
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:25,144
Will we?

202
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:28,197
Hold up, Darius.
How did all of this happen?

203
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,399
Well, I mean,
I knew a guy at Cadillac

204
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:33,118
who knew a guy at Toyota
who knew a guy at Subaru

205
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,204
who sold the club owner
a Dodge.

206
00:08:35,206 --> 00:08:36,989
And then he hit a kid with it.

207
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:39,241
The kid should have dodged.

208
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:41,377
You gotta laugh!

209
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,663
There's a dead kid in the mix
and we got to laugh?

210
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:47,866
It's not his fault
he's not funny.

211
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:51,220
We put his sense of humor
on a high shelf.

212
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:53,088
Hey, Max, you know,

213
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,873
Daddy always told me
you were special,

214
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,425
and now I see it.

215
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:59,211
And it's not just because you
think everything I say is funny.

216
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,596
You feel like family.

217
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:03,849
I do? Oh, I always
wanted a brother...

218
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:06,335
Who was a brother.

219
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,188
[Laughter]

220
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,524
Max, do you expect me to wait
on all the tables tonight?

221
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:14,360
Well, I am kind of
in the middle of

222
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:17,529
my family reunion right now.

223
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:20,115
And where is
Mr. Hilarious' soup?

224
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:21,867
Look at blondie, here.
She's like,

225
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:26,505
"Oh my God, do black people
even eat soup?"

226
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:29,574
"It's like, whatever."

227
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:32,394
That is a dead-on Caroline.

228
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:35,297
Is it?

229
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:39,101
Here is your
order ticket from tonight.

230
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:42,554
This pile is for
the people who found hair.

231
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:46,392
These are the hairs
that the people found.

232
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:48,260
Oh, you sound Russian.

233
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:52,314
That's funny because you're not
rushin' to make my soup.

234
00:09:52,316 --> 00:09:54,099
No, no, no, no.
I'm kidding you, man.

235
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:55,984
I get it.
You're just too busy back there

236
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:58,704
not putting on deodorant.

237
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:00,605
You gotta laugh.

238
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:01,792
Do you?

239
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,744
Max, I might be crazy
but now I feel like

240
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:09,064
the heel of this shoe's
starting to--

241
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,084
Oh, gosh.
Now I got to go wipe this down.

242
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:14,753
You know, I was going to
wear this for my audition.

243
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:16,004
And that's gotta go well.

244
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:17,506
Yes, it does.
Because son,

245
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:21,927
there are two jobs in Detroit,
and you just quit one of them.

246
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,429
Don't worry, Daddy.
I'll make you proud.

247
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:25,481
All right?
You'll see.

248
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:26,982
Daddy's been wrong before.

249
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:28,817
He didn't think I could
make it on <i>Soul Train,</i>

250
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:30,235
but there I was,

251
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:33,822
in the bottom left corner
on <i>Soul Train.</i>

252
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:39,912
I feel so terrible.

253
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:41,980
Well, you know we have
to buy him a new shirt.

254
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,916
Max, I've made
seven dollars so far.

255
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,317
We can't afford to buy
him a shirt.

256
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:47,753
We can go shopping for
a reasonable shirt.

257
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:49,654
We have to.
He's family.

258
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:51,924
Is he?

259
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:54,743
And I have to say, I don't like
that brand of put-down humor.

260
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:56,044
And that blonde stereotype?

261
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,513
I mean,
I don't even say "whatever".

262
00:10:57,515 --> 00:11:00,015
But, you know, it's fine.
Whatever.

263
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:07,639
Max, slow down.

264
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:11,393
I can't walk any faster
in Sophie's giant sneakers.

265
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:15,364
I can't believe
she benches 250 in these.

266
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:16,648
Oh, my God.

267
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,850
My hand just touched
the subway floor.

268
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,703
How do I know
someone didn't pee here?

269
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:24,957
Oh, honey, I've peed here.

270
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,459
This is New York.
It's made of pee.

271
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:30,712
And pee hand is what you get
for refusing to wear flat shoes.

272
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:31,964
No way.

273
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,465
I'm living so close
to the gutter as it is.

274
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:36,034
I can't risk being any shorter.

275
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,519
Here's where we're
meeting Darius.

276
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:38,703
"Subway Style".

277
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:40,722
Every time I walk by
this place I wonder

278
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:42,591
"who would ever shop here?"

279
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,643
Now I know--us.

280
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:45,727
First my heel breaks,

281
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:47,379
and now I'm
shopping underground.

282
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:48,897
How much lower can I get?

283
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,266
Brunch on the earth's core?

284
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:56,772
Mmm, oh.
Excuse my mouthful.

285
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:58,557
Mm, I wasn't expecting ladies.

286
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,560
We usually just sell
to pimps and pastors.

287
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:04,329
What can I help
you dolls with?

288
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:06,331
Actually, we're just
here meeting a friend.

289
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,866
We're going to help him
pick out a shirt.

290
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:09,334
Oh, that guy?

291
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:12,004
He's already in the dressing
room trying one on now.

292
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:14,906
Now, listen,
if the price is too high,

293
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,544
you and I can, uh, negotiate.

294
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:21,663
Or you.

295
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:23,748
I still can't believe
we're using our tip money

296
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,933
to buy him a shirt.

297
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:26,685
We're only going
to spend like $40.

298
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,854
And you heard the man.
It can go down.

299
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:31,306
If you go down.

300
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,742
Oh, hey ladies.
There you are.

301
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,644
Look, I switched it up
a little bit.

302
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,262
Do you like me in pink?

303
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,898
My boyfriend does.

304
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,819
He says it makes my cheeks
look rosy, all four of them.

305
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,538
You gotta laugh,
you gotta laugh!

306
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,241
Darius, we're family,
so I'm just going to tell you

307
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,375
like it is.

308
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:52,878
That material
feels a little funky.

309
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,547
I mean, that kind of humor might
have worked over at Toyota--

310
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,715
- It's Chrysler.
- Whatever.

311
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:59,384
But this is New York.
There are a lot of people,

312
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:02,888
be them gays, or blondes,
who might take offense to that.

313
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,457
I mean, I don't,
but, whatever.

314
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,426
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just playing.

315
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:10,062
That's not the kind of stuff
I'm gonna do in my act tonight.

316
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:12,797
No, I wrote some real jokes
with a comic back home.

317
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,633
And, he's Jewish, so you know
it's gonna be funny.

318
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:16,184
And not cheap.

319
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,020
Again, see?
That's the kind of stuff...

320
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:21,106
Caroline, come on.
It's so wrong it's right.

321
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,858
Look, I have
the jokes right here.

322
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,327
Let's take them on a little
test drive and see how they do.

323
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,696
All right?
So back it up, ladies.

324
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:30,165
You going to need
some laughing room.

325
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:33,118
This is going to be hilarious.

326
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,670
Anybody here have a Smart Car?

327
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:39,591
Because I don't think it's smart
to drive half a car.

328
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:42,544
[Fake laugh]

329
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,663
That was new,
I'll keep working on it.

330
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,331
All right, let's try
another one.

331
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,668
You know what, maybe
we weren't back far enough.

332
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,852
Yeah!

333
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:52,854
Yeah, that feels funnier
already, right Caroline?

334
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:54,206
[Fake laugh]

335
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,440
All right.

336
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,726
You know who doesn't
drive a Smart Car?

337
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:03,398
Smart people.
They don't do it.

338
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,284
You gotta laugh.

339
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:06,618
Seriously.

340
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,355
You've got to.
I've got a lot riding on this.

341
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:11,907
I just got it.

342
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:13,909
[Fake laugh]

343
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,628
Oh, my God.
He stinks.

344
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,698
He stinks on ice.
Darius is gonna bomb tonight

345
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,033
and worse, he's going to bomb
in front of Earl.

346
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:26,037
And Earl's pretty sure that's
the son he's most proud of.

347
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,872
You're right.
What are we gonna do?

348
00:14:27,874 --> 00:14:31,093
Now I know you lovely ladies
came in for a shirt,

349
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:33,278
but can I interest you
in a nice suit?

350
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,681
Look at this one.
It's a classic.

351
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:39,568
You can't get
this color above ground.

352
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,904
That's it.
Darius needs a suit.

353
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:44,856
All the professional
comedians wear suits,

354
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:46,158
and like you said,

355
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,226
you have to dress
for the job you want.

356
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:49,361
And with jokes like that,

357
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:52,831
he needs the funniest suit
they have.

358
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,684
Do you have anything from
the Sinbad collection?

359
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,271
I do.

360
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,623
Max, I don't think
the suit's gonna be enough.

361
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,677
I think he needs something else,
you know, like, a puppet.

362
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,245
A puppet?

363
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:10,132
That's exactly what he needs.

364
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:19,194
I went out with
a guy last night.

365
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:22,363
Asked me if we could go Dutch.

366
00:15:22,865 --> 00:15:24,766
I said, "I don't know."

367
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:26,918
"What's Dutch for
cheap-ass bitch?"

368
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,703
[Laughter]

369
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:32,940
You kick him to the curb!

370
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:34,642
We'll be right back,

371
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:37,145
because Mama's gotta go
put her feet up.

372
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:38,479
[Applause]
Uh, miss?

373
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,047
Can we get another round
when you get a chance?

374
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:41,232
Another round?

375
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:44,185
And keep them coming until
we can no longer see.

376
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:45,269
Put it on my card.

377
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:46,270
You got it.

378
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:48,523
Man, that feels good
every time.

379
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,775
Hey, Max.
Just because

380
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:51,892
you're buying me drinks

381
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:55,613
doesn't mean
I'm going to put out.

382
00:15:55,615 --> 00:16:01,052
My celery stick is my
microphone at the comedy club!

383
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:03,421
I'm here, I'm here.

384
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,022
Did you get the puppet?

385
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:08,075
Oh, I've got the puppet.

386
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,084
Hey, come on in.

387
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:20,137
Hey, girls.
How you doing?

388
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,273
Darius The Hilarious is pumped.

389
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,192
I'm totally in
my zone right now.

390
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:26,927
And I can't miss in this suit.

391
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:29,480
Both: Well...

392
00:16:29,482 --> 00:16:31,782
Darius, that's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

393
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,601
- You know we're big fans.
- Big, big fans.

394
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,152
You're amazing,
your act's incredible.

395
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:36,437
Your Darius The Hilarious.

396
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,406
Max and I love
the Smart Car stuff.

397
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,908
It's hilarious, per your name.

398
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,293
But, well, it is New York.

399
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:43,944
Not a lot of people
are smart, or have cars.

400
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,329
Yeah, you know New York.

401
00:16:45,331 --> 00:16:46,998
Not exactly the cutting edge.

402
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,916
So, after Max and I left you,
we had a thought.

403
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:51,469
We got you a puppet.

404
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:54,338
And, yes, I was stoned.
But Caroline was laughing

405
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,341
just as hard as me.

406
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,476
You got me a what?

407
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:00,394
A puppet.
We got you a puppet.

408
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:02,179
But I don't use a puppet.

409
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,432
Until you do.

410
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:06,183
Just imagine,
at the end of your act

411
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:08,236
- or in the beginning...
- Or all the way through.

412
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:10,905
Ladies and gentlemen,
Darius The Hilarious

413
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:14,609
and his partner,
Justin Beaver!

414
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:19,997
"Damn, girl.
And I mean dam."

415
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:24,335
"As in, I built one."

416
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:26,037
And you don't even
have to be funny because

417
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,205
Justin Beaver does
the work for you.

418
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:31,342
Show him, Max.

419
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:32,826
"I'm straight".

420
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:35,463
[Laughter]

421
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:37,965
Both: You gotta laugh!

422
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:40,635
Do I?

423
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:41,886
I mean, honestly?

424
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,388
Making fun of
Justin beaver's Sexuality?

425
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,557
I find that a tad offensive.

426
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,483
This next act comes to us
from the Motor City.

427
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:59,203
Please give it up for
Mr. Darius The Hilarious.

428
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:03,007
[Applause]

429
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:06,711
All right.
How's everybody doing tonight?

430
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:09,547
Who out there has a Smart Car?

431
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:13,000
Because I don't think it's smart
to drive a half a car.

432
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:15,369
You gotta laugh.

433
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:17,838
[Fake laugh]

434
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,209
Oh, no.
I ran out of fake laughter.

435
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:23,711
Yeah, I mean, Smart Car.

436
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:25,396
Have you seen this thing?

437
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:28,401
It's like you driving
around in a backpack.

438
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:32,436
You gotta laugh.

439
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:33,887
Do we?

440
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:38,576
Why don't we have a Smart Car
write some jokes for you?

441
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:41,529
Yeah, well, I can see why you
would defend the Smart Car.

442
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:44,231
It's the only car your feet
can reach the pedals in.

443
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:48,586
[Laughter]

444
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:53,924
Yeah, but that's so true.
He's very short!

445
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:58,596
As is the car.
It all lines up.

446
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:00,548
Look at this
gray-haired scrub, man.

447
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,968
Apparently black do crack.

448
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,469
Hey, Don King called.

449
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,588
Said he want
his whole head back.

450
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:12,727
Max, look.
Look how proud Earl is.

451
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:13,927
Hey, hey, hey, blondie.

452
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,929
You mind not talking
until I finish?

453
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,281
Wait, a minute.
You're probably just thinking,

454
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:23,154
"Oh, my God. Shoes, shoes,
hairbrush, shoes."

455
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:24,155
Oh, my God.

456
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:28,492
I actually was
thinking about shoes!

457
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:30,944
I'm sorry, there's
a problem with your card.

458
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,797
It's been declined.

459
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,888
Max.

460
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,457
Darius told me what you did and
that was awful nice of you.

461
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:46,126
Now, here.
I am reimbursing you

462
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:49,180
for all of the clothes
and for that damn puppet.

463
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:53,651
Although I swore I would
never pay for beaver.

464
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:55,603
Do you think he'll
ever make it, Earl?

465
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:58,472
Who's to say nowadays, Max?

466
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:03,143
America's Got Talent.
Do they?

467
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:05,830
All I know is he's my kid,
and you went out of your way

468
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:07,698
to try and help him.

469
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,251
Well, I just wanted
you to be proud.

470
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:13,738
I am, Max.
Very proud.

471
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:18,642
I just talked to Visa.

472
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:23,831
I think they were disappointed
they had pre-approved us.

473
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,667
Look, I killed it.
I had to.

474
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:29,437
It was telling me
to buy a Harley.

475
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,272
Okay, open dialogue.

476
00:20:31,274 --> 00:20:34,174
I used the credit card for
one more thing yesterday.

477
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,027
Open dialogue.
So did I.

478
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:39,563
It's the fanciest lipstick
Payless had.

479
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:42,450
Aw.
And here.

480
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:44,368
Max, are there lizards
in that bag?

481
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,656
I wish.

482
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:52,293
They're as good as new
and no bows.

483
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:54,295
Max, where'd you find a cobbler?

484
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:56,864
A cobbler?

485
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:59,550
I took a time machine.

486
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:01,034
I was supposed to kill Hitler,

487
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:03,721
but I thought your shoes
were more important.

488
00:21:03,723 --> 00:21:05,539
Okay, let's cut up your card.

489
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,508
We should keep one
for business emergencies.

490
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,726
We just have to have
to put it someplace where

491
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:10,845
we'll never be tempted
to reach for it.

492
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:12,563
Oleg, would you put this
down your pants?

493
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:16,216
No problem.

494
