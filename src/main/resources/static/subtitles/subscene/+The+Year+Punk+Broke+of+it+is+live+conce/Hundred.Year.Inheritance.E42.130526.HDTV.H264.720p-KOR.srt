<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,860
Episode 42 ~

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,310
Sorry.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,870
What?

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,920
I'm really sorry, but

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,100
with our Se Yoon,

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,820
I think you'll have to break up.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,760
I was going to give up all my greed, and accept you as my daughter-in-law, but

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,840
I don't think it will work.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,140
You and Se Yoon..

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,070
are not meant to be together.

12
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,550
I... really don't understand what you're saying.

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,470
Did I do something wrong?

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,040
Then mother-in-law, you should tell me.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,330
You didn't hear anything from your mom?

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,150
Hear what?

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,270
You haven't made any mistakes.

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,500
It is true that I looked at you negatively in the beginning.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,060
Once I decided to accepted you as my daughter-in-law, from that point on,

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,750
your kind, gentle and beautiful disposition

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,630
were very pleasing for me to see.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,280
I have no ill feelings towards you.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,880
Then, why all of a sudden, did you say Se Yoon and I have to break up?

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,550
Later...

25
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,570
you'll find out later.

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,780
Maybe,

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,190
you might find out real soon.

28
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,990
I don't understand.

29
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,740
Just...

30
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,270
let's just think that I'm being fickle,

31
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,660
then would you be able to understand?

32
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,430
Mother!

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,360
What I said today,

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,530
Keep it a secret for now.

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,450
When an opportunity comes up,

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,780
I will tell

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,840
Se Yoon.

38
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,820
Mother..

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,460
Mother, mother!

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,480
Mother.

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,190
I'm sorry but..

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,070
I can't break up with Se Yoon.

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,400
And, the reason you told me to break up with him...

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,300
I truly can't understand.

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,270
Please just think it over, mother..

46
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,060
I know I'm far from being perfect, but

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,300
since I'm going to put in my absolute best effort, so

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,410
please give us some leeway, Mother!

49
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,650
The matter between you two

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,010
has already left my hands.

51
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,610
There's nothing that I can do about this anymore.

52
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,070
What do you mean there's nothing you can do?

53
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,690
credits

54
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,540
Mother..

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,490
Mother!

56
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm sorry, but I don't think I will be able to do that.

57
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Please forgive me mother!!

58
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,790
Yes, mother.

59
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,660
I'm..

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,720
Am I calling at the wrong time?

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,490
No, it's okay.

62
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,420
I was going to call you anyways.

63
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,200
Yesterday, I heard that you had a date with my mother.

64
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,550
Huh?

65
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,070
Yes..

66
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,630
You should have let me come with too,

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,310
Well, I thought that you were busy with work at the company.

68
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,960
Perhaps,

69
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,610
Will you be able to spare time for me?

70
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,170
I...

71
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,540
want to buy you a meal.

72
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,050
Yes, that sounds good.

73
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,310
Then I'll come with Chae Won..

74
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,840
No.

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,560
For today, let's meet just the two of us.

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,250
I have something to say to you.

77
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,390
Yes, Son. What's up?

78
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,010
Tonight, you will have to eat with dad alone.

79
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,290
Do you have a business appointment?

80
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,290
No.

81
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,510
Chae Won's mother wanted to eat together.

82
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,940
Chae Won's mother?

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,870
Yes.

84
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,190
She said she had something to tell me.

85
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,330
I might be late, so you don't have to wait up for me.

86
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,610
I'm hanging up.

87
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,370
<i>What now?</i>

88
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,530
Today,

89
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,990
are you meeting with Se Yoon?

90
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,020
He's my son,

91
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,550
do I need to tell you?!

92
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,920
What are you going to say when you meet him?!?

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,200
You don't know!?!

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,100
Choon Hee, please.

95
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,650
<i>Living 30 years</i> in deceit is killing me with indignation.

96
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,250
Every minute and every second is urgent for me.

97
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,300
This is not something that should be handled emotionally.

98
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's talk.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Let meet, huh?

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,140
There's no need.

101
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,310
I'm gonna meet Se Yoon and tell him everything.

102
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,900
Things that should be made right, will be made right.

103
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,640
Do you have to do this?

104
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,860
If I dont,

105
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,300
30 years ago, under my perfectly fine two eyes,

106
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,200
my son was stolen and the unfairness of that has me exploding in anger,

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,810
and you want me to pretend like nothing happened?

108
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,410
Why should I?

109
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,300
The shock Se Yoon is going to receive,

110
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,460
have you thought about it?

111
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,840
A person who thinks like that

112
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,160
is able to steal another's child?

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,320
Your words don't make any sense. Stop it!

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,140
Choon Hee!
Choon Hee, please..

115
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,670
Choon Hee!

116
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,800
Choon Hee!

117
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,860
Were you talking to Chae Won's mother on the phone?

118
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,270
Huh?!

119
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,670
Why are you so shocked?

120
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,920
Why did you get in here without making a sound?

121
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,830
Ah... Without making a sound?
 Ahjumma opened to door for me.

122
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,860
What is it now?

123
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,000
Because of the package. I was worried that you would be searching all day.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,560
Did you find the package?

125
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,860
Huh? Yeah.

126
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,700
Of course I found it.

127
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,000
That's a relief.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,070
It's not like the package had feet. 
 So I was worried, where I could have run off to?

129
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,000
But?

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,470
What did you talk about with Chae Won's mother?

131
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,710
Did you talk about the kids' marriage?

132
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,450
Marriage?

133
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,440
You're acting like it's a new story.

134
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,940
I'm talking about Se Yoon and Chae Won.

135
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,150
I don't feel so well

136
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,040
I think I better go lie down.

137
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,710
You came over because you were worried about me...

138
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,420
I'm really sorry..

139
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,390
I smell something suspicious.

140
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,430
There is definitely something going on.

141
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,450
Between the two,

142
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,450
It's certain that there was a situation in the past they can't talk about.

143
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
What do you think you're doing right now?

144
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,530
Yes..

145
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,810
I was cleaning.

146
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,070
You must be coming from an outing.

147
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,330
Are you really going to come out like this?

148
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,450
I already told you.

149
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,250
I'll become your Daddy Long Legs.

150
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,050
I think you must have misunderstood something.

151
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,270
If you keep on doing this to someone who doesn't want it, then you're being a stalker, Mr. Kim Cheol Gyoo.

152
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,430
Ahh, honey.

153
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,550
Don't be so sharp.

154
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,810
You're making me feel embarrassed.

155
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,720
Here.

156
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,900
What is this?!

157
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,550
When I saw you you last time, your face seemed

158
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,740
so rough with a lot of dark spots.

159
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,660
I brought some Hanyak (korean herbal medicine).

160
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,250
You know it too right, that mom's favorite Korean Medicine Clinic?

161
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,740
The doctor from that clinic prescribed it so it'll be effective.

162
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,060
Are you now giving me the illness and the medicine?

163
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,410
No matter how much I show you how I've changed,

164
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,250
your distrust, I think it's natural.

165
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,420
Because I know I and my mother together
acted so unreasonably to you.

166
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,230
But, until you feel touched,

167
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,950
if I deligently put in my heart-filled efforts for you,

168
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,360
You'll probably acknowledge my sincerity.

169
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,000
I told you already,

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,840
that that isn't going to happen!

171
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,480
I decided to think positively.

172
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,280
I'm so tired of exchanging negative words with you.

173
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,410
Get out now!

174
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,700
Drink this.

175
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,970
You must be very tired working in the factory.

176
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,320
If you drink this, your body will feel great,

177
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,480
Here, drink it.

178
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,020
Really, why are you doing this?

179
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,610
Aiyoo..

180
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,140
This waste, now that it's all spilled, what will we do now?

181
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,350
Stop bothering me and get out now! Please?!

182
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,200
Don't mind me and go on with what you were doing. I'll just finish cleaning and take my leave.

183
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,580
Do you not hear what I'm saying?

184
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,330
Hey!

185
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,270
This jerk!

186
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,390
What is it now?!

187
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,380
Aiyoo.

188
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,700
How have you been?

189
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,970
I came because I had something to say to Chae Won.

190
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,550
What would you have to say to Chae Won?

191
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,540
Hey, hey.

192
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,720
Hey, hey. Let go and talk.

193
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,660
Do it with words.

194
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,810
I think I already told you.

195
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,680
If you come here to talk to Chae Won again, that it won't be fun for you!!

196
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,260
I'm not the old Kim Cheol Gyoo.

197
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,180
I've graduated completely from being a mama's boy, Uncle.

198
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,130
Why am I your uncle?

199
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,790
Why don't you leave!!

200
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,900
Before you cause a huge commotion, just leave now.

201
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,820
Today, I'll be going.

202
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,760
Chae Won, I'm leaving!

203
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,190
Why did that guy come again?

204
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,740
What do you mean 'Why did that guy come again'.

205
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,750
He just wanted to get back together with Chae-Won and was fooling around.

206
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
Hey?!

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
My niece is with Lee Se-Yoon so,

208
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,770
don't interfere!

209
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,840
Let's take care of this.

210
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,240
All day you were gone from your post. Where were you wandering around?

211
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,200
Huh?

212
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,310
Aigoo, what is that stain?

213
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,750
Ahh,

214
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,440
I spilled some herbal medicine while I was feeding it to Chae-Won.

215
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,940
Feed her herbal medicine?

216
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,360
She's looking haggard from all the strenuous factory work.

217
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,200
I went to your favorite Korean Medicine Clinic and got a prescription.

218
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,850
While you went all the way over there getting prescription, did you not think of this old mother of yours?

219
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,000
All you have to do is make a phone call and it gets delivered, pshoong!

220
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,620
Eyi you rascal without prospect!

221
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,210
Aigoo, what now?

222
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,650
I've worked until my finger nails were worn out to raise you,

223
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,270
but this old mom doesn't even enter your thought,

224
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:26,110
and all you can think to get a prescription for is your ex-wife whom you divorced? You unbelievably ungrateful wretch!

225
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,680
Mom, it'll be troublesome, if you keep comparing yourself with Chae Won and being jealous of her.

226
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,060
If Chae Won and I get back together, you must show a different side, 180 degrees from the you of the past.

227
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,120
Aigoo Tsk. You're counting the chicken before they hatch.

228
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:48,470
Hey, your Chae Won and that Se Yoon seem to be having a lot of fun right now.

229
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,170
Wake up and smell the coffee instead of wasting money feeding Bo Yack (Herbal Medicine).

230
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,680
My Chae Won will return to me!

231
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,800
Look at this. Making big promise without any plan.

232
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,790
The noodle samples have arrived.

233
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,680
Oh my goodness. So Fast?!

234
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,620
In July or August is project completion. What do you mean, "already"?

235
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,790
It was made with mugwort which is green, hence green noodles.

236
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,180
It's the advertisement plan.

237
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,500
Do we have to spent this much on advertisement?

238
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,830
For an unknown company like ours, we must first attract consumers' interest via focusing all our efforts in marketing.

239
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:48,330
If we take out the production cost and others, it's 4 billion won for marketing. Isn't that too steep?

240
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,810
4 billion won?

241
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,800
Kim Joo Ri, you've become ballsy.

242
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,440
If we compare it to the inheritance you gave away, it's a price of a gum.

243
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,850
What is this?!

244
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,000
Don't concern yourself with the company's business, just focus on your romance business.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,350
Do you have any progress with Ddang (Chae Won)?

246
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,430
You shocked me, you wench. Did you swallow a funnel!

247
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,650
I'm sure you have the hwabyung because of Gi Ok.
(Hwabyung is a disorder due to repressed anger.)

248
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,590
Aigoo...

249
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:33,000
If she was to be crazy, why can't she be gently crazed. Are there not enough men, that she has to be with that old...

250
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,470
Aiyoo. Mother-in-law!

251
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,090
We came.

252
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,660
My, that beastly being, where does he think this is to show his face again?

253
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,920
Who are you to come into our house?

254
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,430
Mother.

255
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,970
Who is this Ahjumma calling me mother?

256
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,650
Why are you doing this? Making me upset.

257
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,670
This person,

258
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,130
she cried all night, and didn't sleep at all.

259
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,540
Do you think anybody slept?

260
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,080
Because of Gi Ok, your father has the hwabyung

261
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,740
and is under the covers laying down. And I

262
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,310
can't even swallow water, you horrible child!

263
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,250
Father are you really ill?

264
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,320
What are you two doing here?

265
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,000
Once a day

266
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,140
we promised each other that we'll see you and father-in-law to ask for forgiveness.

267
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,710
Are you giving me a disease and then giving me medicine afterwards right now?

268
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,960
We're sorry we've made you worry.

269
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,260
Please stop being angry.

270
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,350
It's too noisy. Close the door.

271
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,110
Father.

272
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,160
I told you to close the door!

273
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,780
Get out of here you two before your father's blood pressure rises!

274
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,100
Please don't get mad like that,

275
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,370
and listen to what I am about to say, Mother-in-Law.

276
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,450
Stop saying mother-in-law nonsense! Why am I your mother-in-law?

277
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,900
My legs hurt so much!

278
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,050
Just endure it, Honey.

279
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,990
You're having fun!

280
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,480
The next time you step into my house again, I won't hold back the salt, so hurry and leave!

281
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,790
Don't you thing this is too much, mother?

282
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,920
Even though you don't like him, he's still your son-in-law! A son-in-law is considered as a guest for 100 years!

283
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,350
This person is not a hundred year's guest, he is a hundred year's enemy!

284
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,940
Did you know that?

285
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,210
How can you treat people like this? Don't you think this is too much?

286
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,470
Are you ok?

287
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,420
I'm okay, so

288
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,100
calm down, Honey.

289
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,530
I'm okay.

290
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,470
I'm back.

291
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,250
You came, Hyungnim?

292
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,050
What?

293
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,690
Yes.

294
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,080
Aigoo.

295
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,380
Don't hurt so much over this, Cheotjjae (last born).

296
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,910
When time passes, Mother-in-law and Father-in-Law will calm down about this.

297
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,320
Honey.

298
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,600
Honey.

299
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,550
Aigoo.

300
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,720
I feel so bad for them I can't watch it any more. Tsk.

301
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,980
Aiyoo.

302
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,490
<i>Have a date with me, Mother. I'll hold the grocery basket. Let's see the market together.</i>

303
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,640
Aigoo.

304
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,340
Why?

305
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,990
What about this one?

306
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,680
How does it look?

307
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,130
The best.

308
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,230
I'm here.

309
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,890
Honey.

310
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,950
What were you thinking about so deeply that you didn't even know a person came?

311
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,170
Outside,

312
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,490
you didn't know that Rooftop and Cheotjjae (last born) was here?

313
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,250
-Oh, really? I didn't know.
-They just left.

314
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,100
Oh, yes.

315
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,430
Is there something wrong?

316
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,370
You're like a half absent person.
What's the matter?

317
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,720
Honey.

318
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,680
Yes?

319
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,850
Um.

320
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,250
I have a dinner appointment today, so I'll go and come back.

321
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,790
Dinner appointment? With who?

322
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,240
I'll tell you when I come back.

323
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,020
Honey. H..H..H..H..H..Honey.

324
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,020
Why is that person like that?

325
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,760
What in the world is the problem?

326
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,680
Se Yoon?

327
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,770
He has a dinner appointment.

328
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,610
By the way,

329
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,630
you should arrange a date in place of that meal we couldn't have the other day.

330
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,510
You mean the face to face meeting?

331
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,790
Gather all the relatives and have a meal.

332
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,600
And arrange a marriage date.

333
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,920
Aren't we rushing into this?

334
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,730
It was your idea to rush this.

335
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,420
Call Choon Hee,

336
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,490
and arrange the date.

337
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,450
The world is small.

338
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,860
Choon Hee's daughter will become our daughter-in-law.

339
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,250



340
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,630
Why are you here, Mother Superior?

341
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,910
Return it to it's rightful place, right now.

342
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,410
Return it to it's rightful place?

343
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,480
What?

344
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,980
What do you mean what?

345
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,280
This child.

346
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,250
What are you saying right now?

347
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,720
You can fool everyone in the world, but

348
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,330
You can't fool God.

349
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,090
Why don't you know that?

350
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,300
I don't understand anything Mother 
 Superior is saying right now.

351
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,910
Did you think I wouldn't know that you switched your dead child with Choon Hee's?

352
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,550
What do you mean by that?

353
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,720
<i>For Sul Joo, born in February, </i>

354
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,130
<i> I made your baby a purple anklet in the form of a violet. </i>

355
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,730
<i>And for Choon Hee, born in April,</i>

356
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,970
<i> I made her baby a pink anklet in the form of a rhododendron flower. </i>

357
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,700
<i> We made these anklets specifically for the two. </i>

358
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,640
<i> For sure, on your child's ankle, </i>

359
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,330
<i> there was a purple anklet in the shape of a violet. </i>

360
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:07,150
Right now, you're lying about Choon Hee's child being yours.

361
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,490
You must be mistaken Mother Superior.

362
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:16,650
Let's go to the hospital and get a blood test, and reveal who's words are telling truth.

363
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,160
Let's go to the hospital, right now.

364
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
Soo Cheol died so

365
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,170
she wanted to abort the baby within. But the person who convinced her otherwise was me and

366
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,680
the first person to nurse him was also me.

367
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,220
If it wasn't for me,

368
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,100
this child wouldn't be in this world.

369
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,290
Anyways, Choon Hee can't raise this child.

370
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,710
She would have sent him to an orphanage or for an adoption.

371
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,200
Those are all excuses.

372
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,200
Tell Choon Hee that you did wrong.

373
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,470
Return this child.

374
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,000
Choon Hee left for America.

375
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,630
America?

376
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,640
<i>She left for America, but I don't have her address, and she has not been in contact.</i>

377
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Even if I wanted to return the child, there is no way to.

378
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,590
Is that true?

379
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:07,890
If you don't believe me, Mother Superior go try and find Choon Hee?

380
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,980
Please save me.

381
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,250
If the truth comes out, I'll get kicked out.

382
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,370
And this child will be abandoned at the orphanage.

383
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,990
We don't even know where Choon Hee is.

384
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,090
If you pretend that you don't know,

385
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,130
There won't be any problems.

386
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,870
<i> Please. Please save my life, Mother Superior. </i>

387
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,090
Please. Save Me.

388
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,000
<i> Please. </i>

389
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,260
Help me Mother Superior.

390
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,950
What are you thinking of that's causing you to stare off into space, Honey?

391
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,620
Honey?

392
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,490
Honey?!

393
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,800
What?

394
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,820
Did you call me?

395
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,150
While eating, what are you thinking about so deeply?

396
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,940
N..No...N.. N..Nothing.

397
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,130
Do you have anything special you want to tell me, mother?

398
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,600
Going on a date with Mother made me nervous.

399
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,900
Perhaps, are you going to scold me without Chae-Won knowing?

400
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,180
No, there's nothing like that.

401
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,440
Just with Se Yoon,

402
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,890
I wanted to eat something delicious together.

403
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,090
That's why we met up.

404
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,870
So, I can eat without burden, right?

405
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,770
Of course.

406
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,900
Eat a lot.

407
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,050
I'll eat well.

408
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,340
Please wrap the sushi for me.

409
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,690
My mom really loves sushi.

410
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,060
Is that so?

411
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,110
Ah, wrap the fried shrimp for me please.

412
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,700
Yes.

413
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,780
To take to your mother?

414
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,950
Yes.

415
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,270
If she hears about fried shrimp, she would wake up immediately even though she's sleeping.

416
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,850
Your mother is really lucky to have you.

417
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,270
Compared to what my mother does for me,

418
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,130
this is nothing.

419
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,060
She is a complete dummy when it pertains to her son.

420
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,930
She thinks I'm the greatest and best looking son.

421
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,050
Even if I do something stupid or say something wrong,

422
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,810
she always is on my side.

423
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,780
Really?

424
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,710
Oh,

425
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,920
I'm not sure if I had any points taken off for being a mama's boy.

426
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,200
Have I got many points off, Mother?

427
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,760
No.

428
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,910
It's nice to see.

429
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,840
When I get married to Chae Won,

430
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,560
I'll be a devoted son to you.

431
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,120
Okay.

432
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,170
Thank you.

433
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,850
Eat.

434
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,330
You too.

435
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,570
This is my first time doing this and it is really embarrassing.

436
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,920
<i>To be thoughtful, I wanted to write a letter,</i>

437
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,820
<i>but as you know my writing skill is a mess.</i>

438
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,350
<i> So, before you go to sleep, I'm going to send you a video message each day. </i>

439
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,810
Today as a celebration of the 1st ever video message

440
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,250
with the idea of recharging my sweetheart who's fatigued due to producing noodle all day

441
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,350
I'll send you the love serenade.

442
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,840
"bato bato bato" "na na na na"

443
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,640
"every lonely night"

444
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,390
"don't want to send you away"

445
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,620
"underneath the fluorescent light"

446
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,920
"my image seem shabby"

447
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,570
"don't like it" "cozily chirping those birds"

448
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,060
"playing with my heart"

449
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,510
"yeah!" "ba ba ba bam"

450
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,960
"ba ba ba bam ba ba" 
 Hey, hey!

451
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,620
"say..." 
I mean...

452
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,320
Wah!

453
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,270
Hey you

454
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,390
I mean, it's not like you're performing an exorcism in the middle of the night

455
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,550
What are you doing right now?

456
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,080
What are you doing, you rascal?

457
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,860
Ay, I was mid-immersion. How come you're messing up my work?

458
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,400
Huh?

459
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,900
You didn't even drink alcohol, so why are you doing this?

460
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,100
Ah,

461
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,270
why are you like this, Cheol Gyoo? Get your head straight!

462
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,150
Mom.

463
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,040
I'm sending a video message to Chae Won!

464
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,190
W-what?

465
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,590



466
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,240
She was working in the factory all day, so to give her strength,

467
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,010
I'm singing to her!

468
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,170
Aigoo, 1/7th, 1/2, 1/3 a penny's worth! (you fool)

469
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,470
You're doing anything! Aigoo.

470
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,710
Mom.

471
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,920
You too, say something.

472
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,590
Hurry!

473
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,220
Aiyoo, I'm fine!

474
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,950
What do you mean you're fine?

475
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,720
Say that I want to see her.

476
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,860
Say that I want to see her! Hurry!

477
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,410
Aiyoo! Aiyoo, aiyoo!

478
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,960
Aiyoo, this fate is worse than a dog's.

479
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,460
<i> Cheol Gyoo says he wants to see you! </i>

480
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,810
<i> He says he wants you to come back. </i>

481
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,880
Why is this person like this?

482
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,380
Oppa, are you married yet?

483
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,790
Well, I haven't met a woman like Gang Sook, so

484
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,650
I am still a bachelor.

485
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,630
Really, Oppa?

486
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,870
That scared me!

487
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,070
You're so messy, I can't stand it!

488
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,790
If you're going to trim your toe nails, go to the corner and cut them!

489
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,690
It's getting everywhere!

490
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,230
It's nothing important, so why are you getting so mad.

491
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,680
Seriously! You're so messy, I can't live!

492
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,320
Can't you do that outside and then come in?

493
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,910
Suddenly it's not like we're dating again, what's the big deal?

494
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,290
What kind of man could have no manners?

495
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,660
Where would you find any manners in our relationship?

496
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,010
What kind of relationship is ours?

497
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,800
Two people that divorced and will get soon back together kind of relationship.

498
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,190
You must dream a lot.

499
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,970
Who said I would marry you again?

500
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,960
Aiyoo, you're so dirty.

501
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,900
Why is she getting so mad?

502
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,350
Why is she like that?

503
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,900



504
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:04,410
When I coincidentally heard your "Ddool Uh" at the cabaret, it felt like my ears just popped open.

505
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:10,150
Lyrics is good, melodie is easily understandable, the song just was so easy on the ears.

506
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,960
Thank you.

507
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,090
Why don't you sign with our Sugar Entertainment?

508
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:22,410
I've heard that President Kang Bo Ju has the midas touch in Teuroteu.

509
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,160
How can such a famous person be...

510
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,560
The first moment I saw you, I got the feeling.

511
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,180
If only you'd trust and let me guide you, I'll make you the Psy of Teuroteu genre.

512
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,030
Psy of Teuroteu genre? 
Yes!

513
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,520
I'll make you the nuclear missile of the music world!

514
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,430
I'll transfer the signing bonus to your account tomorrow. 
Ah, yes.

515
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,990
Then I'll be going. 
Yes.

516
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,690
Your sister's name is Kong Kang Sook isn't it?

517
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,930
How do you know my sister?

518
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,360
We are acquaintances from the past.
 Can you give me her number?

519
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,410
What?

520
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,230
Okay

521
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,510
Put in the number right.

522
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,990
Yes.

523
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,710
If you're tired take a rest. I will wake you when we arrive at your house.

524
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:42,940
It's been such a long time since we had a date. Do you think I can sleep?

525
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,780
As I thought, the saying "Son-in-law's love is the mother-in-law" must be correct.

526
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,890
Hey.

527
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,480
Yes, Mother.

528
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,420
To tell you the truth,

529
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,850
I wanted to meet up to tell you something.

530
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,250
What is it that you want to tell me?

531
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,320
Your mom and I,

532
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,630
were from the same orphanage and 
 lived like really close sisters.

533
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,190
Yes, I heard from my mother.

534
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,530
So...

535
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:25,310
your mother and I both gave birth to a son 
 at the same orphanage on the same day...

536
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,180
Did you hear from your mother?

537
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,930
No, this is the first time I'm hearing this.

538
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,250
You had a son.

539
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,950
I think I heard Chae Won say that you came into the family by yourself.

540
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,020
Then, where is your son?

541
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:58,060



542
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,320
My son...

543
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,190
My son...

544
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,190
Mother, your phone is ringing.

545
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,030
Huh?

546
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,440
Ohh.

547
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,020
Hello?

548
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,800
<i> It's me. Tell me what time the bus will arrive.</i>

549
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,920
Alright.

550
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,360
I was wondering who she went out on a date without me knowing. It seems that it was you.

551
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,820
If she went on a date without you knowing, then we should have stayed out later.

552
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,280
You two talk. We'll be inside.

553
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,400
Yes.

554
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,340
Have a good night.

555
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,720
Yes.

556
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,620
Mother?

557
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,710
I enjoyed today's date.

558
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,620
Okay.

559
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,170
Drive safely SeYoon.

560
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,390
Let's go.

561
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,680
What did you talk about with my mom?

562
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,930
It's a secret.

563
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,220
What is this?

564
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,270
Not much happened.

565
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,920
We just had dinner and drank tea...

566
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,650
Ah, by the way,

567
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,670
Does your mother have a son?

568
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,380
No. It's the first time I'm hearing this.

569
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,010
My mom has a son?

570
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,360
It's not certain but,

571
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,410
that's what I heard at first.

572
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:46,240
It seems like you've heard her wrong. She was living on her own at first and then married my dad.

573
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,800
Your mother didn't say anything to you?

574
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,430
What do you mean?

575
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,710
Never mind, it's nothing.

576
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,580
Did Choon Hee...

577
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,890
tell him the truth?

578
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,970
If that happened,

579
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,230
what would my Se Yoon think of me?

580
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,310
<i> Would he still consider me as his mother? </i>

581
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,780
Or

582
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,000
Would he think I'm the world's

583
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,910
<i>worst thief?</i>

584
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,630
You're not sleeping yet?

585
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,140
Oh. You hadn't returned yet how could I go to sleep?

586
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:52,300
Did dinner with Chae Won's mother go well?

587
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,370
Yes

588
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,590
Did you ask why she wanted to see you?

589
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,210
I think she just wanted to have a meal with me.

590
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,600
Is that right.

591
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,620
Ta-Da

592
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,140
What...is this?

593
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,670
While I was eating dinner, there was a package that made me think of you. It's your favorite sushi and fried shrimp.

594
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,060
You bought this for me to eat?

595
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,840
Try one mom.

596
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,940
Why are you crying mom?

597
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,010
Because I'm thankful.

598
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,680
And I'm happy.

599
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,180
Ah, my mom's becoming old too. She's shedding lot of tears.

600
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,980
How can you be so moved by fried shrimp?

601
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,690
Thank you, Son.

602
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,930
Calm down or you'll get indigestion Mom.

603
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:33,170
<i> I think I heard Chae Won say that you came into the family by yourself. </i>

604
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,320
Then, where is your son?

605
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,400
Finally, our factory's noodle is being sold throughout the country.

606
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,460
That right. You've all worked very hard.

607
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,100
Chae Won, you've worked hard.

608
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,970
It's nothing. Uncles and Aunts have been working hard, too.

609
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,420
You've all worked hard.

610
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:55,730
The work that I couldn't do you guys have done in my place

611
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,600
if I die now I'll have no regrets.

612
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:05,680
We're gonna earn all the money in Korea by selling noodles.You should see your offspring become Chae Beol before you die

613
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:11,960
Father, if I earn $100,000,000, I'll buy the Mil Ban 10,000 Pyong (like Korean acres) in your name.

614
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,110
Always bounced check!

615
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,670
How's that bounced check?

616
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,200
Father, please live long long time.

617
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,510
From now on, us offspring who's inherited the family business will conduct business with all our might.

618
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,220
If this man fell in the water, his mouth would float.

619
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,920
I doubt he'd surface because he'd be too busy talking with the fish.

620
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,430
Ha ha ha 
That's not true!

621
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,460
Of course it's true.

622
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,150
I'm serious!

623
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,860
Hello Se Yoon

624
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,330
My Mom is not feeling well. I want to make her some porridge but I don't know how so I called you.

625
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,300
How did you come to be here...

626
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,620
I came after receiving Se Yoon's phone call.

627
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,420
I made some vegetable soup so have a little, mother-in-law.

628
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,680
What happened to what I told you yesterday and...

629
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,650
I'm sorry mother-in-law but,

630
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,170
If you were to be in my place,

631
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,930
and were told to split up with Se Yoon without any specific reason

632
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,650
would you be able to give up on Se Yoon?

633
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,180
I cannot do that, mother-in-law.

634
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,180
Then...

635
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,300
What if there were a reason why you should never be together?

636
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,860
then can you give up on Se Yoon?

637
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,150
What does that mean?

638
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,400
Does that mean that there's something between us?

639
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,650
Does the taste suit you, mom?

640
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,850
Why did you call &amp; bother Chae Won?

641
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,440
It's no bother at all for me, mother-in-law.

642
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,680
Naturally. This is an excellent opportunity to make some bonus points with you, do you think Chae Won would miss it?

643
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:33,950
Aigoo. You've ran out of things to do so now do you have to provide a singing and dancing service too?

644
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,770
What are you talking about?

645
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,810
When I went upstairs yesterday,

646
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:43,320
he had a necktie around his head and toilet paper wrapped around his body and

647
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,800
was shaking a tambourine and... It was a spectacle!

648
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,650
I can do even more spectacular things only if Chae Won's heart would come back.

649
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,350
Totally lame.

650
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,800
What did you say, you wench?

651
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,570
Aigoo. Why are you shouting at the dining table?

652
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,640
So,

653
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:05,010
Did you receive a thank-you message from Chae Won?

654
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,510
Aigoo. Aigoo. Tsk.

655
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:16,770
Everyday you act a fool with the excuses of doing a good deed.

656
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,160
Hello!

657
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,150
Is that you Gang Suk? It's Bong Su. 
Oh...

658
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,260
Oppa!

659
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,570
Oppa?

660
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,820
Right now?

661
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:47,050
After breakfast, I was drinking Cafe Americano while listening to some music.

662
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,220
By the way, how did you get my number, Oppa?

663
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,430
I asked your younger sister.

664
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,140
My little sis?

665
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,300
Yes, singer Mr. Gang Jin's...

666
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,430
wife? 
Ah, ah yes.

667
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,720
If you don't have any plans for lunch, would you like to join me?

668
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,270
No worries if you have a plan.

669
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,180
I don't have any!

670
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,820
I don't have any plans.

671
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,600
Older sister-in-law.

672
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,300
Did she step out?

673
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,120
I'll borrow her clothes for just a second and return it.

674
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,340
Eeeek! Oh mommy!

675
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,670
You shocked me!

676
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,740
Why are you come into an empty room without the owner's permission and opening the wardrobe, hmmm?

677
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,850
Aiyoo. I was planning on meeting a high school classmate I haven't seen in a while but

678
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,560
I didn't have any suitable clothes to wear so I was going to borrow hers.

679
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,230
Your high school classmate who?

680
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,800
You gotta be kidding. Do you know who it is if I told you?

681
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,200
Naturally. She has so many clothes based on her trade (vocation).

682
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,050
Uh, what's that?

683
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,350
Isn't that the parcel I delivered to Sul Joo?

684
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,340
Uh, why is that here?

685
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,700
Did you get your parcel?

686
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,530
Uh, um, of course. I got it.

687
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,300
That wench lied to me.

688
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,140
What do you have on your hands?

689
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,840
Shhh..

690
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,760
Just what is that she's reacting like that?

691
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,630
Aigoo!

692
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,760
Who is this?

693
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,500
It looks like they're Sul Joo and Chae Won's mom.

694
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,880
Look here, Ms. Yang Choon Hee.

695
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,690
We ARE a married couple, right?

696
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,720
Why do you ask something like that suddenly?

697
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:40,210
Married couple is of one mind and body, of one thought, right?

698
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,020
However,

699
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,770
these days, I don't feel as though I'm of one mind with you, Choon Hee.

700
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,260
Lately, your face is filled with worries and

701
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:59,220
last night, you woke in the middle of the night and cried.

702
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,130
Did you see it?

703
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:03,850
Yes.

704
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,850
I thought about asking you what's the matter but

705
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:11,260
you cried so sadly that I couldn't approach you.

706
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,970
Just what is it about?

707
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,530
We are

708
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:24,000
a married couple.

709
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,440
A little while ago,

710
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,220
I gave you a quick story.

711
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,680
On the year I graduated from high school,

712
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:43,050
I fell in love and set up house with a man who's also an orphan like me

713
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,050
but he died in 3 months in a car accident.

714
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,390
Yes.

715
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,350
Actually,

716
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,430
between us

717
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,310
there was a baby.

718
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,260
What?

719
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,220
I wasn't intentionally trying to hide it from you, Kyo Dong.

720
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,560
I, myself

721
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,860
had such a hard time bringing up that memory

722
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,640
so I didn't say anything.

723
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,080
I gave birth to a baby boy in a maternity clinic,

724
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,240
they couldn't stop my hemorrhaging, so

725
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,110
while I went to get treated at the hospital

726
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,220
the baby was dead due to oxygen deprivation.

727
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,340
Oh dear.

728
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:39,010
Sending the baby's father and the baby to heaven

729
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,220
was unbearable.

730
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,990
On top of that

731
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,270
when I was pregnant with the baby

732
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,020
I didn't have enough courage to raise him by myself so

733
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,800
I thought many bad things too, you know.

734
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,650
The thought of me

735
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,000
being the cause of the baby's death, drove me insane.

736
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,550
But,

737
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,360
But, honey.

738
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,550
The boy who I thought dead,

739
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,730
in reality,

740
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,550
alive all along.

741
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,320
Wha..what?

742
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,890
What does this mean?

743
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,480
That means,

744
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,180
Sul Joo took her own baby and Chae Won's mom's baby

745
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,680
and switched...them.

746
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,480
What does that mean then?

747
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,270
Se yoon is, in fact,

748
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,020
Chae Won's mom's son then? Ooooh!

749
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:02,010
Oh my gooooooood!

750
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,190
Aigoo. How can this be?!

751
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,010
Oh my, you shocked me! You shocked me!

752
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,940
What are you doing in my room, right now?

753
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,080
Um, I, um, didn't see anything.

754
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,430
I..don't know anything.

755
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,520
The diary,

756
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,600
you stole a peek, didn't you?

757
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,600
(nodding)

758
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,220
I didn't intend to steal a peek but

759
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,930
I saw the parcel Sul Joo asked about, accidentally, so..

760
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,850
I got curious and meaninglessly...

761
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,260
I wondered why a parcel that was addressed to me was delivered to that house...

762
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,450
It's because there was a spy in our house.

763
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:55,930
What spy? Nonsense.

764
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,440
Sul Joo called and said that a parcel that she should have received was addressed wrongly and came to our house instead

765
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,800
and asked to bring it to her, so I just

766
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,760
did an errand, that's all.

767
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,260
The content of the diary,

768
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,350
to whom did you reveal it?

769
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,730
I didn't say it to anyone.

770
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,190
I just finished reading and was bringing it back.

771
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,200
This story

772
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,430
you cannot reveal it to anyone.

773
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,060
If per chance this gets out

774
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,100
then you and I are going to both die. Understand?

775
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,260
They say the sense closest to the taste, is the sense of smell.

776
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,290
Therefore, using the sense of smell alone could make salivary gland react.

777
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,620
Is there salivation? 
 Yep.

778
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,520
Then it's half way successful.

779
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,100
Then just imagine and...

780
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,490
I think I'm feeling it.

781
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:07,430
<i>Those two are so in love,</i>

782
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,490
<i>I'm sorry, Se Yoon.</i>

783
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,580
<i>What should be the karma for me, has gone to you.</i>

784
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,400
<i>What can we do about this?</i>

785
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,800
credits

786
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,400
It's one of the top music companies in the country, and

787
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,470
when the President heard me sing,
because he liked it so much
that he made me an offer right away.

788
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,290
Here,

789
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,080
the contract amount,

790
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,420
W50,000,000 so

791
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,580
we changed the Rooftop apartment from monthly rent to annual lease.

792
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,300
What's the big deal about a lease at that age, please.

793
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,770
Aiyoo, tsk, tsk, tsk.

794
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,780
Mom!

795
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,850
I'm still lacking but

796
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,050
when "Ddool Uh" (song title = "break through") becomes a hit,

797
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,650
in a year,

798
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,780
I'll definitely buy her a building.

799
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,260
Only the mouth is alive saying blah, blah, blah!

800
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,700
By the way,

801
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,950
is the title of the song "Ddool Uh"?

802
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,910
Yes.

803
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,020
"Ddool Uh, Ddool Uh,"Ddool Uh!"

804
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,100
"Ddool Uh, Ddool Uh, Ddool Uh,"

805
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,990
"break through all the blockage in my life"

806
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,980
"face it head on and breakthrough", "just run looking only ahead",

807
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,970
"breakthrough all the blockage in my life"

808
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:29,110
Shut it!

809
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:33,990
Your noise is breaking my inner peace so shut it.

810
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,800
Son!

811
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,310
Daddy will open the lids for you.

812
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,570
By the way, Bo Reum,

813
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,250
where did Mom go that we don't even see a glimpse of her?

814
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:10,200
This wife of mine, she even turned off her cell phone. Where is she, and what is she up to?

815
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,390
When we are sitting like this, it makes me think of the first time we met at the eatery.

816
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,730
I know.

817
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:22,210
You bought me all the dumplings and dokboki I wanted.

818
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:25,010
I don't spend money on just anyone.

819
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:30,400
The first time I met you, I thought you might be the woman for me, so I spent some money.

820
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,580
Of course, how can any man not have a crush on you?

821
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,340
Is that true?

822
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:43,730
How was my first impression?

823
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:45,150
Well...

824
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,620
Should I say you seemed like a single blossom of magnolia?

825
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,500
You were warm, yet cold.

826
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,890
You seemed open and bright, yet under a shade of darkness.

827
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,920
I felt you seemed somewhat unorthodox?

828
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,940
<i>Everything he says sounds so elegant.</i>

829
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,620
<i>I must have been crazy.</i>

830
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,350
<i>Why did I ignore this king card, and end up with someone like Uhm Ki Choon?</i>

831
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:09,380
After I heard you got married, I cried for 2 nights and 3 days.

832
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,930
<i>He said he didn't get married because he couldn't find someone like me.</i>

833
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:15,660
<i>I think he meant it.</i>

834
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:24,690
credits

835
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,600
Just a second!

836
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,030
You should have my personal wine glass.

837
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,630
Ah... I'm sorry.

838
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,060
Please wait just a minute, President.

839
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,340
Oppa, you must be really successful.

840
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,530
The company that was on your business card, I looked up on the internet.

841
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,850
It's a really big recording company, I found out.

842
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,610
After I got dumped by you,

843
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,140
I gritted my teeth and worked really hard,

844
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,780
and became successful.

845
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:58,430
<i>It seems like he was really hurt by me.</i>

846
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,660
Here...

847
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,000
To our time together,

848
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,600
Cheers!

849
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,010
Cheers!

850
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,730
Omo! Omo!

851
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,380
Hello.

852
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,410
Aigoo... This person...

853
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,260
Why did you come here again?

854
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,210
I came to see Chae Won, but she wasn't at the factory. I was waiting for her.

855
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,700
It seems like she went somewhere.

856
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,070
Ah...

857
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,770
Chae Won went to Se Yoon's house.

858
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:45,120
Why did she go to that bastard's house?

859
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,420
Se Yoon's mom is sick, so she went to make some porridge for her.

860
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,240
Now, she completely became their daughter-in-law!

861
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,850
Aiyoo!

862
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:53,940
Aiyoo... Calm down.

863
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,350
Aiyoo, you can get hurt.

864
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:59,360
Anyway, it's like talking to a wall.

865
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:02,220
No matter what I do, what kind of show I put on,

866
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,140
she doesn't even blink an eye.

867
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:08,200
If it doesn't work with all my efforts, then I don't think it's meant to work.

868
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,460
That's not it.

869
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,750
I won't do anymore crazy things.

870
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:18,750
I think I'll give up on everything.

871
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,130
What do you mean you will give up?

872
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,880
Why do you want to give up when you're almost there?

873
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,030
Pardon?

874
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,420
Ah...

875
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,430
You're almost there now, so close eyes tightly, and

876
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:30,070
wait a little more. Huh?

877
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:33,170
What do you mean I'm almost there?
 They treat me like an insect.

878
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,760
Aiyoo...

879
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,850
You're skipping lunch, and waiting for our Chae Won?

880
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,570
Is that for real, Aunty?

881
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,770
Sh...

882
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:53,160
This must remain an absolute secret.

883
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,080
Sh!

884
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,500
I was going to keep my mouth shut.

885
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,660
Others don't need to know about it, but I thought you definitely should know. That's why I told you.

886
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,700
You must have suffered a lot all this time because of Chae Won.

887
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,940
Anyway, our Chae Won will have no choice, but come back to you.

888
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,780
So don't be too anxious, okay?

889
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,140
Then, Lee Se Yoon's biological mom is

890
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,290
Chae Won's mom, right?!

891
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,760
Sh...

892
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,270
Lower your voice a bit.

893
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,390
How can something like this happen in the world?

894
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,110
So,

895
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:33,020
things like this can happen in life.

896
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,670
Chae Won's mom has her eyes set on getting Se Yoon back, and got a blood test.

897
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:42,250
If that happens, then Chae Won and Se Yoon will

898
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,270
become siblings.

899
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,780
Right.

900
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,560
Their marriage plan

901
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,390
will be over.

902
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,770
Heavens helped you, Son-in-law Kim.

903
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,740
Oh... Oh...

904
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,550
Thank you, Aunty.

905
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,090
I'll never forget my indebtedness to you.

906
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:59,390
Ah...

907
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,860
You don't need to say like that.

908
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,810
Since you desperately want Chae Won,

909
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,170
I felt bad for you.

910
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,260
If I...

911
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,760
get back together with Chae Won,

912
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,450
I'll really treat you big, Aunty!

913
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,090
Look at you.

914
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,460
I'm not doing this because I have an ulterior motive.

915
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,050
Oh my god!

916
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:25,800
Yes!

917
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,410
The fact that Se Yoon is

918
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:48,650
my son...

919
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:53,260
Why did you tell me now?

920
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,360
Rather...

921
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,690
Rather...

922
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:04,170
It would have been better for me not to know, Mother Superior.

923
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:18,450
I think I have to go today without visiting the elders.

924
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:20,140
I need to go to the company.

925
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,390
Okay.

926
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:22,990
Then, hurry up and go.

927
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,590
Thank you for today.

928
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,550
Mom looked like she was very thankful.

929
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,430
Se Yoon,

930
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:31,930
perhaps,

931
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:36,700
something didn't happen that I don't know about, right?

932
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:39,260
What are you talking about?

933
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,380
It's good, if there is nothing.

934
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,170
For some reason, Mother

935
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,860
didn't look good.

936
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,280
Mom says she's like that because of her menopause.

937
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:54,550
I really think she should get a thorough check up.

938
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,550
She's sick often lately.

939
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,210
I'll be going.

940
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,510
What are you doing here again?

941
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,080
I came by because I was just curious.

942
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,460
You said you were busy.

943
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,030
Just ignore him and go.

944
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,050
I'll see you going in first, then I'll leave.

945
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:23,230
Hurry up and go in.

946
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,430
Alright.

947
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,670
You guys look good together, as brothers and sisters.
