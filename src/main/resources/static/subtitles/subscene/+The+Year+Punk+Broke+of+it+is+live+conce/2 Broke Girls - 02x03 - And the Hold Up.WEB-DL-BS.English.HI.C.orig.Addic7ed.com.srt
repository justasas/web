Her name is Marina Abramovic.

7
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:14,337
In the 90's she and her boyfriend
did this piece called "Confrontation"

8
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,637
where they just slapped
each other's faces for days.

9
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:17,803
Oh yeah?

10
00:00:17,804 --> 00:00:19,337
My mom and her boyfriend
did that too,

11
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:22,190
but they called it,
"Who smoked the last cigarette."

12
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:24,842
No, really, it was pure art.
She's a genius.

13

How about you and I
do a little art right now?

might be doing a scene

I'll take you tomorrow.

I've been sneaking into theaters
since I was two.

135
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:18,320
I crawled
into <i>The Little Mermaid</i>

136
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:19,654
with a sack full of Cheerios

137
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:21,823

full of Diet Coke.

the only thing

139

through that robbery was you.

I peed myself.

144

He's the only one from my circle
who still talks to me.

145
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:48,216

I would have taken a bullet

146
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:49,884
for her,
but she put herself first,

147
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:51,720
and that's okay.
It's fine.

148
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:54,222
Max, I'm surprised
you're even affected by this.

149
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:57,592
I mean, weren't you shot
as a baby?

150
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,194
I feel like you told me that.

151
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:02,931
No, I told you I drank shots
as a baby.

152
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:05,967
My mother hated
to drink alone.

153
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,469
Okay, what free movie
should we see?

154
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:09,704
Maybe something
with a Fanning in it?

155
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:12,140
- I'll see anything
unless it's in 3-D.

156
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:14,075
I mean, if something's
gonna be flying at my face,

157
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:16,644
I'd better get a free prime rib
out of it.

158
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:19,280
So what do we do, Max?
What do we do?

Hide in the back alley
till the coast is clear,

160
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:23,952
and when the door opens,
make a break for it?

161
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:26,988
No, 'cause it's not the 1940s.

162

We just go right up
in the usher's face,

163
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,393
make an excuse, and then
boldly walk with purpose.

164
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:33,128
Okay, well, just show me how.

Walk, walk, walk, hair flip,
walk, walk.

173
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:04,192
Good, but easy
on the hair flip, Willow Smith.

174
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:08,463
[Knocks at door]

175
00:08:08,465 --> 00:08:10,932
Oh, hi, girls.

176
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:13,134
Oh, I heard what happened.

177
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:15,970
Max, you got pushed in front
of a gun.

178
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:19,040
You must be very pissed.

179
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:23,711
Caroline,
oh, what a nice outfit.

180
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:27,882
On a scale of one to ten,
you're an eight.

181
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,451
Get it?
Urinate.

182
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:34,389
[Laughter]

183
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:36,791
How do you even know
what happened?

184
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:39,294
Oh, well, Oleg told me
when we were upstairs

185
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:43,031
playing "hide the penis,"

186
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,300
and we laughed so hard,
we almost peed ourselves,

187
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:48,369
but we didn't
because we're not you.

188
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,407
Actually, we're going
to a movie.

189
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,709
Oh, well, that's nice.

190
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:57,912
I hope you're gonna wear
your big girl pants.

191
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,748
- Max.
- What? It's silly and funny.

192
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,552
She's like
a Polish fart cushion.

193
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:05,920
Look, if it makes you
feel any better,

194
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,722
there can't be
any pee jokes left.

195
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:09,324
[Giggles]
What are you seeing,

196
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:12,160
something rated "pee pee 13"?

197
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:14,996
[Laughter]

198
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:17,465
Fart cushions are funny.

199
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:27,730
- There's the guy.
- I'm getting a little nervous.

200
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,465
I'm starting to sweat
like those people

201
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:31,968
on <i>Locked Up Abroad.</i>
I don't know why.

202
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,836
I haven't swallowed
a heroin balloon.

203
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:35,405
Okay, let's go.
[Exhales]

204
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:39,008
Pretend we're out of breath.
[Exhales]

205
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,978
Out of breath,
not out of your mind.

206
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,813
[Exhales]
Hey, sorry.

207
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,448
Can we just run back
into the theater for a second?

208
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,283
I left my iPhone in there,
and the prescription

209
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,152
for her anti-seizure
medication's on it.

210
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,753
Yeah, which theater
were you in?

211
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,622
Theatre five.
Went to the 11:15.

212
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:54,290
Got out at 1:20.
A little long.

213
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,359
Could've cut ten from it.

214
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:02,465
Wow, your walk with purpose
is getting

215
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,667
almost as impressive
as Han's "bang, bang,"

216
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,703
you're in my house now,
bitch!"

217
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,638
I know.
What about Han?

218
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,474
Before yesterday, we thought
he was 53 and unarmed.

219
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,042
Guess we learn something new
about people every day.

220
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,510
[Chuckles] Yeah,
like having to learn

221
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:16,713
that when you get nervous,
I'm disposable.

222
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,683
That was very uncharacteristic
of me.

223
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:24,120
Hi, um, Hallelujah.

224
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,621
Cool name, by the way.

225
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:27,123
How are you doing today,
Hallelujah?

226
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,158
Bitter.

227
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,860
They wouldn't let me put
an exclamation point

228
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,862
on my name tag.

229
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:34,364
Um, is there any way
you could make

230
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:35,698
a fresh batch of popcorn?

231
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
I could,
but it takes ten minutes,

232
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,068
and your show starts in two.

233
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,503
Actually, it takes 31/2,

234
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:41,804
and I can miss a few trailers.

235
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:43,406
I used to work
at a Cineplex Five.

236
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:47,210
Oh, so now you just know
everything about life?

237
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,679
Come on,
the opening scene sets up

238
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,414
where he gets
his superpowers from.

239
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,651
Hey, Hallelujah here
is doing the best he can.

240
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,086
I mean, based on his name,

241
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:59,489
his parents clearly had
bigger dreams for him,

242
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,391
and it is not his fault
you guys showed up two minutes

243
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,892
before the show starts.

244
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:05,028
Maybe next time,
you'll show up ten minutes early

245
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,096
without the attitude
and the fidgety exhaling.

246
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,531
You think Hallelujah
doesn't hear that?

247
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:12,268
- He does.
- Sorry to be such a problem.

248
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,770
We'll just take
whatever you've got ready.

249
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:16,506
No, girl.
I got you.

250
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,174
I'm gonna make you
a fresh batch.

251
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,243
Hallelujah, could I have
some fresh too?

252
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:22,845
You'll get the burnt ones
and like it, nerd.

253
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:28,951
Let's sit down here.

254

Ooh, I'm not sticking
to the floor yet.

255
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,688
Fancy theater.

256
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,190
Oh, hey, guys.

257
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,792
Hope I wasn't too hard
on you out there.

258
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:37,493
Nice cape.

259
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:39,896
Thanks.
I had it in my backpack.

260
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,965
- I wasn't sure.
- Hmm.

261
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:48,104
You made the right choice.

She likes my cape.

264

Technically, she likes
your sister's cape.

265
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:59,215
Okay, so I don't know anything
about these superhero movies.

266
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,617
It's a remake of a prequel
to a sequel?

267
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,319
- I'm already confused.
- Okay.

268
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:08,458
So there's always a nerdy guy...
[Whistles]

269
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,393
And he's either been wronged
or bitten

270
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:11,394
or exposed to something toxic.

271
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,229
It gives him superpowers.

272
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,064
He's in love with a pretty girl
who his rival tries to kill

273
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,432
but then won't
because they have

274
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,567
to make another movie.

275
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:18,968
Also, partial nudity,

276

product placement,
dope explosions,

277
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,972
and a killer score
by Hans Zimmer.

278
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,108
Okay, your knowledge
of these superhero movies

279
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,177
is kind of turning me on
right now.

280
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,448
Wait.
Are you kidding me?

281
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,617
The hero has red hair
as a child?

282
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,686
Um, weird,
'cause when he grows up,

283
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:38,988
he has black hair.

284
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,790
Was there some sort
of chemical spill,

285
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,826
which, by the way, wasn't
in the original comic book!

286

- What am I, dumb?
- Okay.

287

Okay, come on.

288

Come on, let's go
to another movie.

What are you talking about?

290
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:50,967
Well, you obviously hate this.

291

You're yelling at the screen.

292
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:53,836
Yelling at the screen
is the best part

293
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,505
of going to the movies,
and more white people

294
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:58,441
should learn that.

Oh, wow, look at that.

That car just exploded
in front of those two girls,

298
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,618
and one didn't use
the other's body

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,288
to block her
from the flying debris.

300

Are you ever
gonna let this go?

301
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,459
I don't know.
I mean, it's kind of a big deal.

302

You put my life in danger.

303

about it twice.

how much more I can do.

00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:28,171
Yeah, I could have died,

308
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,673
but you apologized twice,
so I guess we're good.

[Girl shrieks]

310
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:33,309
I don't like this movie.

311
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,311
It's violence against women.

312
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:37,380
Let's go see that
Katherine Heigl rom-com sequel.

313
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:40,650
Talk about violence
against women.

314
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,052
I am gonna go spend some time
with Katie Heigl.

At least she won't
make me feel guilty.

See ya.

Enjoy three

I don't wanna go to a movie
by myself, and you're right.

319
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,266
I'm sorry.
I hate the way I acted.

320

I'm a spoiled rich girl,
and I always put myself first,

321

and I know that's something
you would never do.

It is Han.
What's he doing here?

Why is he sitting
all the way in the back?

326
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:14,784
I don't know,
maybe he's afraid

00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,719
of blocking
absolutely no one's view.

And who is that guy and girl
he's sitting with?

330
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:25,962
Is Han in a threesome?

The only game Han has

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,561
Are you seeing anyone?

345
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:01,197
That was hard to watch.

346
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,943
Why is he going to
the bathroom with that stranger?

347
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:15,012
Is Han
also a republican senator?

348
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,248
Usher.

349
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,624
Are all men's rooms
this depressing?

350
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,859
We are such different people.

351
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,794
I was just gonna say
how nice it is.

352
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,830
I don't hear sex sounds,

353
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,900
and he's not
on the changing table,

354
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,136
so maybe drugs are involved.

355
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,538
You think Han's
an Asian drug dealer?

356
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,541
What's he selling,
crystal math?

357
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,876
Oh, look.
Han's coming.

358
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,677
- Aw, gross!
- No, no!

359
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,082
I meant he's coming this way.

360
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,918
Hey, you're running.
Don't run, it's Han.

361
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,888
For him, every step we take
is like a 100-meter dash.

362
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,690
Sorry, you're the one
who doesn't want Han to see us.

363
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,926
I just don't want that kind
of relationship with him.

364
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,060
You mean the kind
of relationship

365
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,362

366
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,696
at the movie theater
and say hello?

367
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,231
Yeah, I definitely
don't want that.

Ladies, may I
see your tickets, please?

370

Tickets?
Max, do you--

371
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,241
Can I see
your tickets, please?

372
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,877
I saw you
go into another theater.

373
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,346
Caroline?

374
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,016
Hi, honey.

375
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,918
Hello?

376
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,786
Honey, I forgot my ticket.

377
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,087
He has my ticket.

378
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,956
Han, this nice usher man
thinks I snuck

379
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,525
into the theater,
so just show him the tickets.

380
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,095
Uh, uh--

381
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,430
You two are together?

382
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,133
- Yeah, why?
- Oh, it's nothing.

383
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,367
It's none of my business,

384
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,236
but he just seems
too old for you.

385
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,906
- He's 29.
- What?

386
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,442
Uh, I'm gonna have to see you

387
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,144
and your girlfriend's ticket.

388
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,980
Uh, I thought
I put the ticket in here.

389
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,482
Tickets. You put two tickets
in there, honey.

390
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,919
Um, okay.

391
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:05,389
I cannot find it.
Damn.

392
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,892
Sir, you know
that sneaking into a theater's

393
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:08,960
a felony, right?

394
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,496
It is?

395
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,399
Han, what's that face?

396
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,103
It's the same face I made
when I peed--

397
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,472
Oh, honey.

398
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,108
How will I live
with the shame?

399
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,776
Well, at least your fanny pack

400
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,512
isn't the most embarrassing
thing about you any more.

401
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,990
Well, well, well,
look who it is.

402
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,493
Hair flip and go.

403
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,929
I don't know what you're
doing, but it feels weird.

404
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,598
Now, look who's walk,
walk, walking with purpose

405
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,800
away from me again.

406
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,636
What?
It wasn't a big deal.

407
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:55,039
Really? 'Cause I went
to movie jail with Han.

408
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,141
- Cool.
- We have a mug shot.

409
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,843
We're a notorious
gangster couple now

410
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,177
down at the Cineplex.

411
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,014
That's right,
Han-nie and Clyde,

412
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,548
but you know what, I'm fine.

413
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,817
I'm thrilled, actually,
because you walking away

414
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,219
gave me one thing.

415
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,489
An obstructed view
of my sweet, sweet ass?

416
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,557
No, the satisfaction
of knowing

417
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,359
that you are just
as selfish as me.

418
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,495
[Scoffs]
What a selfish thing to say.

419
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,365
[Chuckles] You can walk,
walk, walk away from me, Max,

420
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,633
but you can't walk away
from knowing

421
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,901
that you split the scene.

422
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,170
What? I thought you
were behind me,

423
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,039
and besides, we couldn't both
get caught.

424
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,407
Who would live
to tell the tale

425
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,075
of the great Caroline Channing,
the girl

426
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,710
who couldn't walk fast enough?

427
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,813
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't turn this around.

428
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,249
Now, I see it,
the whole "Max" of it all.

429
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,984
When we got caught,
you only thought

430
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,585
about saving yourself,

431
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,487
and you weren't defending
poor Hallelujah.

432
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,690
You just wanted fresh popcorn
for yourself.

433
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,825
What can I say?
I guess you're on to me.

434
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,227
You said you'd take
a bullet for me.

435
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,829
You'd never take
a bullet for me.

436
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,365
Probably not.
No one ever takes a bullet.

437
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,067
It's just something people say
that they don't mean,

438
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,401
like, "how was your day?"

439
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,304
Or, "we'll stop
if it hurts."

440
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,211
Wow, so this
is who we are, huh?

441
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,380
Two selfish girls
who always put ourselves

442
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,681
before everyone else
and are willing

443
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,016
to do anything to survive?

444
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,085
Guess we are.

445
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,420
Man, we're gonna crush
the cupcake competition.

446
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,956
But, Max,
even though we're ruthless,

447
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,458
every now and then,
on our own behalf,

448
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,126
we do put ourselves second,

449
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,762
and I guess that's
what makes us best friends.

450
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:27,064
I don't think
I've ever done that.

00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,265
Yes, you have.

Go ahead.

where I didn't put myself first.

when you find it.

How do you even know
about this?

Oh, Oleg told me
while we were having phone sex.

472
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:26,257
And by phone sex, she means
we were using the phone

473
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,793
in the sex.

Hey, listen to me.

like a man

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,520
That's true.
I did.

You're cool.
