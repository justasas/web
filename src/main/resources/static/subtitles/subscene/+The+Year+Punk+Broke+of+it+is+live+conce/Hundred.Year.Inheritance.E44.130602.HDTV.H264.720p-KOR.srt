<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,810
<i>Episode 44</i>

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,740
Even though they don't share a drop of blood,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,340
they are still siblings!

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,360
How can they marry?

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,060
You keep on saying that we're siblings.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,260
What do you mean by that?!

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,250
He's drunk. Why are you concerned?

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,700
What are you doing?

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,990
Why aren't you taking him outside? Hurry!

11
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,820
Okay.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Let's go out, jerk!

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,910
Aunty, you definitely told me...!

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,910
That Lee Se Yoon's mom switched her dead son with Mother-in-law's son!

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,940
<i>Is he really crazy?!</i>
 He's drunk...

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,400
Why are you being like this, seriously?

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,440
Aiyoo!

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,070
If you drank, you should recover quietly somewhere. How dare you come here and become argumentative?

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,130
Won't you get out of this house immediately?!

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,150
Wait a moment, Sister-in-law.

21
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,900
You...

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,300
Can you take responsibility for what you just said?

23
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,910
Of course I can.

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,600
Even though my speech is a little slurred from alcohol,

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,560
my mind is clear.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,380
Stop it, please!

27
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,730
The mother who gave birth to Lee Se Yoon is no one other than

28
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,930
Mother-in-law

29
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,870
here.

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,480
What is this jerk saying right now?!

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,990
<i>Omo! Son-in-law Kim!
Son-in-law Kim!</i>

32
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,830
<i>Omo!</i>

33
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,660
Mom,

34
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,200
what he just said...

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,130
I...

36
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,580
I.. I'll...

37
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,040
excuse myself first.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
Mother!

39
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,430
<i>Seriously!</i>

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,760
Sister-in-law, Choon Hee, why don't you speak?

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,990
What on earth is going on?

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,860
Something... is wrong, right, Mom?

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,000
How can something like this...?

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,420
Something like this can never happen, right?

45
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,390
I think it would be most accurate to hear from Sister-in-law. Speak, hurry.

46
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,670
What happened?

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,660
Please go home.

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,460
If you hear directly from Unni,

49
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,080
it would be better.

50
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,260
Mother!

51
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,190
I'll take you home.

52
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,360
No, it's alright.

53
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,780
I can go home alone.

54
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,260
Ah... I'm really alright.

55
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,660
I'll be going.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,810
Se Yoon!

57
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,210
You knew about it all along, but

58
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,460
didn't say anything to me?

59
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,830
How could you do that?

60
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,460
Mother-in-law and Mom...

61
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,100
were afraid that you might get hurt.

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,750
I can't believe it.

63
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,060
Is there some misunderstanding...?

64
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,750
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

65
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,680
Ok...

66
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,100
Please be careful going home.

67
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,010
You're really shocked, aren't you?

68
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you okay?

69
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,930
Are you saying everything Son-in-law Kim said is true?

70
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,320
Yes, Mother.

71
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,200
What in the world...?

72
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,210
How can a person do something like that?

73
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,570
I know.

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
You really don't know the inside of people.

75
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,540
Such an elegant and perfect looking madam stole someone else's child...

76
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,490
What kind of talk is that?

77
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,230
I still can't believe it.

78
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,020
By the way,

79
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,740
how did that bastard, Son-in-law Kim, find out the truth?

80
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,520
How do you think he found out?

81
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,110
Probably Hyungnim couldn't keep her mouth closed.

82
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,330
Anyway, that mouth of yours is the problem.

83
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,830
Why did you say useless things to Son-in-law Kim, and cause all this trouble?

84
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,120
Oh... I...

85
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,940
I felt sorry for Son-in-law Kim as a human being.

86
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,740
Why do you feel sorry for this jerk?!

87
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,060
Do you know what he has done to our Chae Won?!

88
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,970
Honestly, Son-in-law Kim was really devoted to our Chae won.

89
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,110
Son-in-law Kim's mom was the one who treated her awfully.

90
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,170
The alligator bag who've been carrying around lately, Son-in-law Kim gave it to you, right?

91
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,860
Alligator bag?

92
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,880
Oh...

93
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,700
I returned everything to him earlier.

94
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,720
If you say "everything", that means there were more things besides the alligator bag.

95
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,980
You're screwed up inside.

96
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,820
How come you don't have any principles?

97
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,340
No matter how much you wanted the alligator bag,

98
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,260
still, Chae Won despised Son-in-law Kim so much.

99
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,940
And, you sided with him?

100
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,110
I'm not being like this because of the alligator bag.

101
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,480
I was just moved by Son-in-law Kim's pure love and devotion to Chae Won.

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,020
And in the end, it became difficult for her to marry Se Yoon anyway.

103
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,710
What can we do about it?

104
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:24,320
I was really counting on Se Yoon to be my granddaughter's husband. What do I do since he's too good to give up?

105
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,220
You say something too!

106
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,740
Don't just sit there like that.

107
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,070
I feel sleepy.

108
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,480
Hurry up and lay down the blanket.

109
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,950
Hey.

110
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,970
Your father

111
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,340
looks very disappointed.

112
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,040
Aiyoo, what do we do?

113
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,200
Eh...

114
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,600
Aigoo... Aigoo.

115
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,420
The more I think about it, the more confused I get.

116
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,600
I can't object to the marriage or support it.

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,530
So...

118
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,560
By the way, that bastard, does he think this is his bedroom?

119
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,250
Hey, get up.

120
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,650
Won't you hurry up and go home?!

121
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,360
Hey!

122
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,530
If something like that happened, you should have discussed it with me.

123
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,530
How could you not tell me and keep it to yourself?

124
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Am I really your husband?

125
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,360
I thought if I just kept quiet,

126
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:58,420
it would be easier on everyone else.

127
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,440
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

128
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,940
Then,

129
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,270
you're weren't ever going to tell Se Yoon?

130
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,390
Even though Se Yoon is my son,

131
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,990
Chae Won is also my daughter.

132
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,910
Finding my son

133
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,720
would make my daughter cry tears of blood

134
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,010
What else could I do?

135
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,330
I had no idea.

136
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,560
And I kept on talking about bringing your son back.

137
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,960
How...

138
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,070
How can we handle this situation...

139
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,910
I have no idea.

140
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,170
I was going to keep it a secret for the kids' sake.

141
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,410
I have no idea how things happened like this.

142
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Se Yoon looked so shocked.

143
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,580
I wonder if he's ok.

144
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,110
Exactly what this is about,

145
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,040
tell us in detail.

146
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,800
What that person said earlier, is it true?

147
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,230
Did you...

148
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,550
Did you really...

149
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,420
Yes.

150
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,170
That's right.

151
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,950
I did that.

152
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,500
Honey?

153
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,560
Mom?

154
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,450
It sounds like an excuse,

155
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,470
but at that time, I didn't have a choice.

156
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,160
The son I gave birth to, after four miscarriages,

157
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,410
died as soon as he was born.

158
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,920
Would I be in the right mental state?

159
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,880
And having an orphan as a daughter-in-law,

160
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,690
your mom was unhappy about everything.
 If I didn't carry on the bloodline,

161
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,680
she threatened to do it outside our marriage.

162
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,310
I had no other choice.

163
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,610
As soon as you were born, Choon Hee went to the hospital because the bleeding didn't stop.

164
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,230
Instead of feeding my crying baby,

165
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,990
I fed you my breast milk first.

166
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,760
While you were being breastfed,

167
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,940
I looked at you as you were watching my eyes,

168
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,160
even though I didn't give birth to you,

169
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,420
I felt that you were my child.

170
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,940
This is the truth, Se Yoon.

171
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,100
Those words are not enough justification, Mom.

172
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,150
I have no intentions to justify.

173
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,940
My feelings at that time,

174
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,040
that's what I'm conveying.

175
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,320
Even up to now, never once

176
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,030
did I think that you're not born out of my body.

177
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,780
Even in my dreams,

178
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,160
I never thought that.

179
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,760
You kept this completely secret from me.

180
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,150
How could you do that?

181
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,240
It might seem brazen,

182
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,810
but if I were to go back 30 years,

183
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,180
I probably

184
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,300
would make the same choice.

185
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,390
For me,

186
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,420
I really like being your mother.

187
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,050
You, being my son,

188
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,700
I really like it.

189
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,270
Even if I were to die,

190
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,100
even in the afterlife,

191
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,540
and in the afterlife after that as well.

192
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,270
Se Yoon.

193
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,920
I definitely

194
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,570
will be

195
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,070
your mother.

196
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,990
<i>You seem to really care about your mother.</i>

197
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,410
<i>Compared to what my mom does for me,</i>

198
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,550
<i>this is nothing.</i>

199
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,260
<i>Mom is completely clueless when it comes to me.</i>

200
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,010
<i>She thinks I'm the greatest and wonderful son in the world.</i>

201
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,800
<i>Is that right?</i>

202
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,060
Ehh~

203
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,240
<i>Because you're staring at me that way, I'm too embarrassed to eat, Mother.</i>

204
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,590
<i>Oh.</i>

205
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,380
<i>Aiyoo...</i>

206
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,410
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

207
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,720
<i>You're really shocked, aren't you?</i>

208
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:55,120
<i>The person you're calling is not answering 
Please leave a message after the beep</i>

209
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,370
He has his cell phone turned off.

210
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,650
Where is he, and what is he doing?

211
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,540
Aigoo...

212
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,640
You haven't gone to bed yet?

213
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,520
How could I sleep when you left like that?

214
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,850
What were you doing all this time?

215
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,210
I went to the in-law's.

216
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,840
Which in-law? Chae Won's?

217
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,390
Yes.

218
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:39,470
Lee Se Yoon's family was the invited guest for dinner, so I went and sprayed cold water on their party.

219
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,330
Sprayed cold water?

220
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,630
That's jerk Se Yoon

221
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,430
his birth mother is Chae Won's stepmom.

222
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,200
Wait,

223
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,590
Are you sure you didn't misunderstand?

224
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:57,450
That jerk's birthmom is really Chae Won's stepmom?

225
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,470
I'm telling you it's true!

226
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,860
That's jerks mom took her dead baby,

227
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,860
and switched him with Se Yoon.

228
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,010
Oh my God!

229
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,990
How could someone be so awful?

230
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,260
Oh my God!

231
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,290
Aigoo, externally,

232
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,860
She acts so high and mighty all the time.

233
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,490
She's not even worth a penny.

234
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,700



235
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,310
What are you guys still doing awake?

236
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,360
Hey hey hey~

237
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,360
The heavens have helped you and Se Yoon out.

238
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,090
What do you mean all of a sudden?

239
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,860
That Se Yoon, the truth is

240
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,720
Chae Won's stepmom's son.

241
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,680
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,960
You're just now home.

243
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,660
You didn't answer your phone so I was worried.

244
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,740
I want to be alone.

245
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,360
Please get out.

246
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,280
Se Yoon.

247
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,430
I said please!

248
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,120
I don't want to hear another word

249
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,040
or say anything.

250
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,370
Ok,

251
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,920
I understand.

252
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,570
Go ahead and rest.

253
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,290
Se Yoon

254
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,940
just came home.

255
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,220
Where...

256
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,500
Are you going?

257
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,170
For now,

258
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,640
I'm going to sleep in the other room.

259
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,840
I could have prepared breakfast,

260
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,570
Why are you awake already?

261
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,430
I'm sorry for yesterday.

262
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,980
I had no idea son-in-law Kim would have done that.

263
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,030
The cold wind is really blowing.

264
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,840
It's not a cold wind, but the wind of a swipe of a knife.

265
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,520
I don't care how much you like alligator bags. 
How could you?

266
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,810
I told you,

267
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,820
I didn't do it for the alligator bag,

268
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,940
but because I felt sorry for him!

269
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,660
Yeah right!

270
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,980
Did you sleep well Sook Ah?

271
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,830
I've been recording all night, and having some ramyun now.

272
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,970
Drinking the refreshing ramyun broth made me think of you.

273
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,440
So I'm texting you.

274
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
Who's texting you so early?

275
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,920
It's a spam text.

276
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,990
<i>The person you are calling is not available. 
Please leave a message after the beep</i>

277
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,090
Can I come inside?

278
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,410
Yes, Mother.

279
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,390
Were you able to call Se Yoon?

280
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,910
Not yet.

281
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,780
Surely,

282
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,680
there wouldn't be a problem, right?

283
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,080
I'll go to the company later.

284
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,430
Even if it was hard,

285
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,360
I was planning to keep everything a secret.

286
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,300
How could this happen?

287
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,170
You were let down a lot, right?

288
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,680
Are you already leaving for work? What about breakfast?

289
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,780
I'm fine.

290
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,570
Aigoo. But anyway,

291
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:03,900
The sales were going up steadily, but how come we're always losing money? Huh?

292
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,800
Why do we have to extend ourselves to private loan?

293
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,300
Loosely wait about a month. I'll be responsible for putting us in the black.

294
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,660
Can I trust that?

295
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,320
During launch period, there were many 1+1 sale (buy1 get1 free) &amp; rebate events, and ad fee expenditure was heavy too.

296
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Now that consumers brand awareness is up, we're going to carry out a regular marketing strategy.

297
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,290
Aigoo.

298
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,020
But, was what Oppa said yesterday true?

299
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,260
It's true!

300
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,980
How could someone who thinks so highly of themself

301
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,550
be such a thief?

302
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,160
We were about to be in-laws with that person!

303
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,030
How can a human act that way? 
I can't even imagine!

304
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,790
I'll be leaving before I'm late.

305
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,220
Ok. Work hard.

306
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,120
Aigoo aigoo aigoo aigoo aigoo~

307
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,180
Your sister couldn't even have breakfast because of work,

308
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,000
and you come down like this?

309
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,810
I'm just a front man, president in name only, anyway.

310
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,320
Aigoo, must be nice!

311
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,100
What do you mean must be nice? 
I can't sleep because I'm thinking of Chae Won.

312
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,310
She can't marry that guy anyway so isn't it a shoe in?

313
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,530
Don't just assume, but go and talk to Chae Won for me.

314
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,400
Aigoo...

315
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:38,190
As we're at the juncture where Joo Ri and that jerk are over, why on earth do I need to visit that household?

316
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,710
Don't you want to have grandchildren?

317
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,500
What?!

318
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,520
If I don't marry Chae Won, then I won't ever marry.

319
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,900
So if you don't want grandkids, then do whatever you want.

320
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,780
Do you have to be like this?

321
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,760
No matter how much I tell her you changed 
she doesn't believe me.

322
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,490
So you go to her and show her you changed.

323
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,800
Aigoo drat, aigoo drat, aigoo drat!

324
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,950
MOM!

325
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,210
What the... You scared the crap out of me!

326
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,920
Just once~

327
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,860
Aigoo~ Aigoo Aigoo Aigoo.

328
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,250
AIGOO!

329
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,900
I'm here...

330
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,350
Se Yoon.

331
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,280
Oh...

332
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,290
When did you get here?

333
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,130
Just now.

334
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,120
Have a seat.

335
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,790
I was worried because I couldn't reach you.

336
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,910
Are you alright?

337
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,650
I'm trying

338
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,280
to be alright

339
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,520
the best I can.

340
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,090
It's hard.

341
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,170
Mom is really worried too.

342
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,150
You didn't have breakfast, did you?

343
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,310
Mom made this.

344
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,880
I made

345
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,280
the heart.

346
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,830
For mom's heart.

347
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,080
How...

348
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,200
Is she doing?

349
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,130
She's...

350
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,700
Doing her best.

351
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,250
It must have been difficult.

352
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,180
How long has she known?

353
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,490
I don't think it's been long.

354
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,800
When the head nun past,

355
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,460
She sent a secret diary to mom.

356
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,410
Nothing should change.

357
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,880
Even if my birth mom is your step mom.

358
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,850
Nothing,

359
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,620
should change between us.

360
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,580
Later...

361
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,860
Let's talk about us later.

362
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,030
Since the end of 1 + 1 promotion (buy one get one free), the sales has been declining significantly.

363
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:57,510
Our competitor has launched a new product as well.

364
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,690
We got a new product?

365
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,610
<i> Try our new noodles</i>

366
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,000
Enjoy our new noodles.

367
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,700
Welcome.

368
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,630
It's been a long time.

369
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,170
You're even doing this?

370
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,580
You didn't have enough work at the factory 
so you picked up a part-time job?

371
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,380
If you're not going to try it then leave.

372
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,400
I'll try it. 
I'm curious about the new product.

373
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,930
Thank you.

374
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,670
Oh...

375
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,120
Congratulations.

376
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,060
You must be happy to

377
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,750
have a big brother like Se Yoon.

378
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,840
Again, congrats!

379
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,870
Welcome. Try our new noodles.

380
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,360
Put Kim Yong Gun on the phone, please.

381
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,450
You are aware of our competitor's new product launch?

382
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,230
I just tasted it, and it's completely different than the typical prepared noodles. Find out how they produced it!

383
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,530
<i>Thank you</i>

384
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,690
Welcome. Try our noodles.

385
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,040
Here you go.

386
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,840
Try this, our new noodles.

387
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,120
What brings you hear without a word?

388
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,810
I've brought young radish Kimchi because you said you were eating rameon noodles after an all-nighter.

389
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,200
I didn't ask you to bring me lunch.

390
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,320
With our relationship you didn't have to tell me anything, oppa.

391
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,860
I just wanted to bring some for you 
so just enjoy.

392
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,960
You made this kimchi yourself?

393
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,320
Of course, oppa!

394
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,540
I'm so touched!

395
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,950
Having Sook Ah's hand made kimchi,

396
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,040
Is this a dream or reality... I'm unsure.

397
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,910
Pinch me.

398
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,020
Ouch.

399
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,210
Since you're here come and have a tour.

400
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,980
Oh, your sister-in-law's husband is here.

401
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,600
Her husband?

402
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,870
He started recording.

403
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,300
No it's ok. I already have plans.

404
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,110
You're leaving after you came all this way?

405
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,960
Just today.

406
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,340
Also, please don't tell

407
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,920
my brother-in-law that you saw me.

408
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,700
Don't tell him about the kimchi either.

409
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,990
How come?

410
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,930
Because he's such an odd bird.

411
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,240
He doesn't have a good relationship with my in-laws either.

412
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,730
Ok. Don't worry.

413
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,030
You must have had a guest, President?

414
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,740
Someone I know came to see me.

415
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,650
I mixed this for you,

416
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,250
So enjoy! 
<i>Wow</i>

417
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,870
Thank you.

418
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,900
Have it with this kimchi.

419
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,270
Ok.

420
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,310
This is a familiar taste.

421
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,400
Pardon?

422
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,420
Oh, nothing.

423
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,150
That's kimchi is totally the same as the in-laws.

424
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,120
Album hot of the press.

425
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
Is it to your liking?

426
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,360
Why are you acting like this??

427
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,300
Boss, you're my savior.

428
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,060
I'll become #1 with "Teu Teu Roo"

429
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,320
and repay you 10, no 100 times back.

430
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,870
For certain, without a fail,

431
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,070
I'm gonna become a Psy of teuroteu!

432
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,610
Yes, yes!

433
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,820
That's great to know, now let go.

434
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,450
I won't ever let you down!

435
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,000
I'll do my best.

436
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,560
I can do it!

437
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,400
Yes, yes, you can stop this now

438
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,920
Boss, I'll be the best singer in Korea.

439
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,540
I understand just...

440
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,020
That's okay!

441
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,620
In my life,

442
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,540
you're the best!

443
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,150
Stop this now!! Enough!

444
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,520
My noodles are soggy now.

445
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,120
I hate soggy, puffy noodles more than anything.

446
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,000
You eat this.

447
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,800
I got too excited.

448
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,970
It's alright.

449
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,900
Father-in-law! Are you okay?!

450
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,030
Father-in-law!!

451
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,960
Father-in-law, father-in-law!!

452
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,940
What's wrong? Are you okay??

453
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,330
Take me home.

454
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,120
You don't look good, shouldn't you go to the hospital??

455
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,000
No, it's okay, I just need to go home

456
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,660
I understand! Let me carry you

457
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,650
What on earth happened??

458
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,660
He was just sitting there

459
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,350
at the neighbor pharmacy so I carried him here.

460
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,580
Then you should have taken him to the hospital? What can we do here at home?

461
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,030
There's no need, I'm fine

462
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,940
You're not okay, father

463
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,460
It could be a huge problem!

464
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,780
I did it to test Kang son-in-law.

465
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,510
I did it on purpose so don't worry.

466
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,210
Father-in-law..I

467
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,100
am son-in-law

468
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,890
Is that right?

469
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,850
Judging by the way you ran with me as a piggy-backer,

470
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,390
I think you can live about 50 more years.

471
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:51,320
There won't be a problem with you a Gi Ook.

472
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,270
So what you're saying,

473
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,990
is that you're acknowledging me as your youngest son-in-law.

474
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,760
Can I take it like that, Father-in-law?

475
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,740
Thank you!

476
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,140
Father-in-law

477
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,460
Thank you so much!

478
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,890
Actually, today, my album came out for the new song.

479
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,290
So I'm so happy.

480
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,170
Father-in-law.

481
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,490
You even called me Son-in-law Kang.

482
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,070
Even if I were to die right now, I have no regrets.

483
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,480
Hey,

484
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,640
How can you leave my daughter and die?

485
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,830
I'm just saying, that's all.

486
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,410
What's going on here?

487
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,920
Mother-in-law, you're here?

488
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,230
What are you doing here, Rooftop?

489
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,320
Just now, father-in-law

490
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,520
called me Son-in-law Kang.

491
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,310
Mother-in-law too, please don't call me Rooftop anymore.

492
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,630
Please call me Son-in-law Kang, Mother-in-law.

493
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,640
Thus, what dog-eating-grass kind of nonsense are you talking about?

494
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,470
Have you gone senile?

495
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,070
How could you call him son-in-law?

496
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,460
Do you have dementia?

497
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,020
Please stop it, mother

498
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,500
<i>Sul Joo Unni</i>

499
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,490
What do you have to say?

500
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,140
I shouldn't say these words to you, but

501
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,860
my heart.

502
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,910
is at peace.

503
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,990
All these years, not for one day,

504
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,090
I was able to sleep

505
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,370
without anxiety.

506
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,520
I always suffer from nightmares.

507
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,420
I'm anxious and apprehensive.

508
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,420
From the very moment I've stolen your son away,

509
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,200
I was locked up by the jail of conscience,

510
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,650
for 30 years,

511
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,610
I couldn't live breathing freely.

512
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:33,510
I thought it was the rightly receivable

513
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,030
punishment.

514
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,220
You should.

515
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,350
After ruining someone's life completely,

516
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,920
if you were able to sleep in peace, then would you be a human being?

517
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,810
What...

518
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,630
Can I do to make things right?

519
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,390
Even though I can't

520
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,730
erase your heartache

521
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,140
How can I

522
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,690
compensate you, at least a little bit,

523
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,100
for your ruined life.

524
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,190
Even now,

525
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,410
if I were to be judged by the law receive my punishment,

526
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,440
would your heartache ease?

527
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,900
If not,

528
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,570
should I disappear from your eyes?

529
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,850
To far away,

530
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,520
Should I go abroad?

531
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,720
If that won't do, our Se Yoon...

532
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,860
I mean,

533
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,200
your son...

534
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,920
Put him on your family registry

535
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,540
and you guys live together

536
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,160
Then, would you be more at ease.

537
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:07,100
I'll do everything you tell me to.

538
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,900
I really will, Choon Hee.

539
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,760
I'll think about it.

540
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,380
I...

541
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,090
really missed you.

542
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,760
Even though I insisted that you to go back to the States,

543
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,030
when I saw you after 30 years,

544
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:37,970
deep down I was happy to see you.

545
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,560
I wanted to just tell you everything.

546
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,110
I wondered if I should beg for forgiveness.

547
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,780
I kept on having such weak thoughts.

548
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:51,170
Because I didn't want to waver anymore,

549
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,890
I became

550
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,620
more harsh towards you,

551
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,400
and treated you awfully.

552
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,090
We...

553
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,220
The way we were 30 years ago...

554
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,100
Is it possible to go back the way we were, Choon Hee?

555
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,550
You are very brazen.

556
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,890
How can you, with the current situation,

557
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,190
want to return to the way we were 30 years ago?

558
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,360
I,

559
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,100
cannot forgive you until you die.

560
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,050
No.

561
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,270
Even when I die and become a ghost, I cannot forgive you!

562
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,530
Ai, you rascal, why do you keep making me repeat myself?

563
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:05,030
Ok, I got it!

564
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,420
Today, I will get a definite answer when I get back, no matter what. So,

565
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,940
just CHILL OUT!

566
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,400
Hello in-law.

567
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,320
How have you been?

568
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,960
It couldn't have been good because that thief.

569
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,380
You must have went through a lot.

570
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,330
Why are you here?

571
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,390
I heard the story from Chul Gyoo and thought about you, in-law.

572
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:40,740
How you must have been so heart-broken, so I came by as fast I could to console you.

573
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,130
How could she appear after we were talking about her?

574
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,730
How can you call yourself a human being?

575
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,570
Aigoo, in public, you totally

576
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:02,270
act cultured and refined but in reality you were lying. How can you steal someone else's priceless son?

577
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,530
I've seen all kinds of thieves at my age,

578
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,530
but this is the first time I have ever seen a baby thief.

579
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:17,280
These kind of people should have

580
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,910
a huge advertisement posted about how they're human trash.

581
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,450
That's enough.

582
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,140
Aigoo...

583
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,700
You're so kindhearted.

584
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,170
If someone did that to my Chul Gyoo...

585
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:39,650
I wouldn't be satisfied even with them locked up.

586
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,260
Aigoo, she's acting haughty until the end. Distasteful.

587
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,900
Aigoo, nauseating.

588
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,660
If you're done, then please leave.

589
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,620
What do you mean done? 
I'm just starting.

590
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,660



591
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,780
I told you we have nothing to talk about.
 Why do you even come inside the house?

592
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,990
Aigoo,

593
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,150
How can you not even offer your guest some water?

594
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,990
and repudiate me before I even start?
Hah! Please.

595
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,200
Boss, I'll be outside.

596
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,450
Okay!

597
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,570
In-laws, I'm here.

598
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,270
First your son, and now you.

599
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,570
Ah.. Why are you here again?

600
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,810
What do you mean?

601
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,610
We promised to forge an alliance, reneging now would be a slight.

602
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,120
Who's here?

603
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:29,000
Have you been well elder?

604
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,740
What the heck are you doing here?

605
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:40,430
I had a cause to come and discuss with you, Elder, so I came by.

606
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,490
So what I'm saying is

607
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:58,050
We should get the kids back together.

608
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,870
Back together?

609
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,950
Since she can't marry Se Yoon,

610
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,350
let's go back to square one, and have Cheol Gyoo and Chae Won

611
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,790
get remarried.
 That's what I mean.

612
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,620
You think marriage is a joke?

613
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,410
How could you say that?

614
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,280
That makes no sense.

615
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,260
How can we trust you to send 
 Chae Won back to THAT house?

616
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,400
THAT house?

617
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,990
Don't you think you're being rude?

618
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,740
What do you mean rude?

619
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,200
Just thinking of how much Chae Won suffered, it still makes me shiver.

620
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,200
This... in-law...

621
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,140
Why have you been so quiet all this time?


622
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,240
You should say something to help me out during times like these?

623
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,990
What should I say?

624
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,490
Why are you talking like that?

625
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,880
Earlier,

626
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:00,830
I sent a video to my ex daughter-in law.

627
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:04,910
If she remarries my Cheol Gyu, then as of that day,

628
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,990
I'll let them have a separate household,

629
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,570
and only once a month,

630
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,440
I'll see them, I vowed.

631
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,070
As they said, a previous governor is the best governor,

632
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,120
After time passed, honestly, there's no other daughter-in-law like Chae Won,

633
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:25,990
in the world. I've realized that thoroughly.

634
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,780
So,

635
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,030
Despite my shame,

636
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,450
that's why I'm here.

637
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,110
To ask for your permission.

638
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,290
Please

639
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:40,950
let's get Chul Gyoo

640
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,280
and Chae Won back together.

641
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,920
We have no thoughts to do that.

642
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,780
I,

643
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,530
never thought of anyone but

644
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,030
Se Yoon for my granddaughter.

645
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,950
What do you mean?

646
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:06,610
How can you say something that is so obscene?

647
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,320
Se Yoon's mom is Chae Won's step mom.

648
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,200
Even so,

649
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,880
you will approve of their marriage?

650
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,890
That's all.

651
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,690
"How ill bred is this family?"

652
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,280
Yes?

653
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,320
What are you doing here Father in law?

654
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,990
You must be busy. I don't know if I'm bothering you.

655
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,030
No you're not.

656
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,450
Have a seat.

657
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:56,250
Would you like some tea?

658
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:01,530
No that's alright. 
It's been rough, huh?

659
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,570
I know it's hard.

660
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:09,990
I...

661
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,070
Wish that you could be

662
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,400
understanding of your two mothers.

663
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,860
For thirty years

664
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,990
Chaewon's mother who thought her son was dead and

665
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,320
the mother that raised you

666
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,610
for thirty years

667
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,910
the both of them are your mothers.

668
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,910
At this point, whom would you choose, and whom would you get rid of ?

669
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,280
Your birth mom, or the mom that raised you.

670
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,240
They both brought you to this point.

671
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,660
Even though it may be difficult,

672
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,410
I hope

673
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,650
that you will be understanding of both of them.

674
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:53,980
Also,

675
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,400
the issue of your marriage to Chaewon

676
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,190
take some time and think about it.

677
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,950
Father in law

678
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,780
I can't ever break up with Chaewon.

679
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,400
That problem;

680
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,030
later,

681
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,240
let's discuss it later.

682
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,040
Aigoo!

683
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,150
Aiyoo!

684
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,450
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!!!

685
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:23,860
Mommy, Mommy!

686
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,900
Aiyoo. Your mom won't die, so stop calling me.

687
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,030
What did in-laws say?

688
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,530
Aigoo...

689
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,030
I can't believe it.

690
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:33,160
What?

691
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,990
Chae Won's grandfather!

692
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,200
What about grandfather?

693
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,110
For his grandson-in-law

694
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:43,880
Se Yoon is his only choice.

695
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,990
It's not like he's senile, seriously.

696
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,240
That's strange. There's no way. He loved me!

697
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,900
Aigoo~ You're so confused.

698
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,780
Not even one person in that house hold was on your side.

699
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,240
Stop drinking the kimchi juice and get to your senses!

700
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,240
Then are you saying I should give up on Chaewon?

701
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,160
I can't ever do that!

702
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,200
I don't care if you give up or not. I've done all I can so you're on your own now.

703
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,530
There's a big problem.

704
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,250
What happened?

705
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,820
I just received a word from the borough office that

706
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,280
from our noodle

707
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,200
twice the standard allowance of

708
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,990
heavy metal has been found.

709
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:23,820
What are you saying?

710
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,460
How could they find heavy metal from a perfectly fine noodle?

711
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,200
I believe it must be due to the main ingredient

712
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,120
mugwort.

713
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:36,520
What are you talking about? When you received mugwort delivery, didn't you check the quality assurance certificate?

714
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,700
We checked,

715
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,450
however,

716
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,240
because we received the delivery of cheap priced murgwort,

717
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,280
there was a problem.

718
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,200



719
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,160
A-ah, tell Kim Joo Ri director to return quickly, to the office, quickly!

720
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,170
Honey

721
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,080
Are you sick?

722
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,500
No I'm not.

723
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,870
I was sleepy so I laid down.

724
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,330
I'm not sick.

725
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,870
Ta Da!

726
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,880
Omona! Your album is out.

727
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,400
What do you think?

728
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,610
That's awesome!

729
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,230
Your picture is very handsome.

730
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,150
You know I'm truly photogenic!

731
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,150
You're better in person!

732
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,330
Oh~

733
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:31,280
I have to celebrate cutting my album (CD). Gotta throw the celebration party!

734
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:36,520
I bought pig feet and makeolli.

735
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,150
What...

736
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,240
What's wrong honey?

737
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,080
The pig's feet seems rotten it smells funny.

738
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:52,990
It's fine.

739
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,490
It's not rotten.

740
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,760
It must have been something I ate at lunch.

741
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,670
Anyway, I can't eat this so you enjoy it by yourself.

742
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,070
Then makeolli,

743
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,100
have a cup.

744
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:18,580



745
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,950
This is rotten too.

746
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,070
No it's not.

747
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,780
I think you're wrong.

748
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:37,510
Did you plan to ruin this company as well?

749
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:40,740
How can heavy metal be discovered in the noodle, huh?

750
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,630
Something must have went wrong.

751
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,090
That cannot be!

752
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:48,290
This is impossible!

753
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,020
Hey!

754
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,000
What happened?

755
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,890
It looks like we'll have to recall all the noodles distributed in the market.

756
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:57,060
What?

757
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:01,010
How can we do that after so much money has been poured over it to distribute it?!

758
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,010
It's already all over the internet.

759
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,660
You may have to prepare for production suspension or operation suspension,

760
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,520
even an administrative measure.

761
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,010
What?

762
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,820
Ahh~

763
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,520
AHHHHHHH~

764
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,320
Mom!

765
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,880
MOOOOM!

766
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,370
Oh...!

767
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,510
Are you ok Mom?

768
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,560
OOOOHHHH~

769
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,850
Mr. Kim Cheol Gyu's mother was here?

770
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,500
She asked if you could

771
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:28,030
get back together with Kim son-in-law.

772
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,740
Do you still have some feeling for him?

773
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,590
That's nonsense Dad.

774
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:35,830
In any case with Seyoon...

775
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,480
Even if I don't get married to him,

776
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,170
There's no way I would be with Mr. Cheol Gyu again.

777
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,540
Goodnight

778
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:00,080
I met with Se Yoon earlier.

779
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:08,310
I went to see how he was doing.

780
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,200
Thank you.

781
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,130
He must be going through a lot.

782
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,580
If you want

783
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,860
to live with Seyoon do so.

784
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,430
Don't pay attention to what others think.

785
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,560
Just do what you think best.

786
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,230
I'll follow your decision.

787
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,790
Where did you drink so much?

788
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,700
I have to drink so I'll be able to sleep.

789
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,410
So I had a drink.

790
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,870
Seyoon...

791
00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:02,730
I thought my mom was the warmest and 
best person in the world

792
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,510
I did, but...

793
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,640
now that I look

794
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:12,020
Mom you're a really scary person.

795
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,040
How could you do something like that

796
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,550
And for 30 years,

797
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:26,200
Act like nothing happened?

798
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:33,060
When I think of that I get goose bumps all over and get frightened so

799
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,340
I can't look at your face.

800
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,780
I'm sorry.

801
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,100
That's alright.

802
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,810
I can go up myself.

803
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,420
<i>Hello?</i>

804
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,320
Chae Won

805
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,800
What?

806
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,250
There's...

807
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:46,140
Nothing different between us.

808
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,050
Like planned,

809
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:52,330
Let's get married next month.

810
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,570
Why aren't you answering?

811
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,880
Who cares who's son I am?

812
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,900
I love you

813
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,720
and you love me

814
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,090
Isn't that what's important?

815
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:15,910
Since you're drunk just sleep 
and we'll talk tomorrow.

816
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:19,540
Chae Won, 
You're mine.

817
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,060
You belong to Se Yoon.

818
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:27,320
<i>From your head to your toes</i>

819
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,630
I won't let anyone take you from me.

820
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,310
Se Yoon...

821
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,440
We worked so hard...

822
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,140
to break up?

823
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,660
Even if I die,

824
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,750
I can't do that.

825
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:50,290
I can't do that!

826
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,690
<i>Se Yoon</i>


827
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,180
Se Yoon?

828
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,740
Did you fall asleep?

829
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:05,620
<i>Living, isn't living</i>

830
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:12,500
<i>Why did I fall in love with you? </i>

831
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,370
<i>longing for you just expands</i>

832
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:22,810
<i>I can't bear to forget you.
I still</i>

833
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:29,260
<i>only love you.</i>

834
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,930
<i>Let's talk for a moment.</i>

835
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:50,560
I've been thinking for awhile.

836
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,810
Let's pretend

837
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:55,740
like the wedding plans never happened.

838
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,710
Father.

839
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:01,200
After finding out the truth,

840
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,670
there's no way you can marry each other.

841
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,810
Honey...

842
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,980
If,

843
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:13,820
You decide to marry her,

844
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,060
I won't be your father anymore.

845
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,350
Honey! How can you say that?

846
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,400
Stay out of it!

847
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,510
I don't care who your birth mother is,

848
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:29,300
You're my son.

849
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,520
That's how it was in the past, and that won't change.

850
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,340
But,

851
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:42,030
if you insist on marrying that girl til the end,

852
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:46,660
I will take it as your decision to cut our father-son ties

853
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,890
that's how I will take it.

854
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:49,830
Father?

855
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:51,810
Also,

856
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:57,190
Since the person responsible for that is your mom

857
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,870
We will separate.

858
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,130
Father?

859
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,210
<i>In other news</i>

860
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:24,000
<i>Green Noodle produced by Joong Yong Gp, launched last June, was found to contain lead, cadmium like heavy metal</i>

861
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,510
<i>therefore the Green Noodle currently in distribution is in a state of total recall.</i>

862
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:31,770
<i>Green Noodles already sold within the market place amounts to 390 ton,</i>

863
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,430
<i>in that time, noodle...</i>

864
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,720
What is this saying?

865
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,940
Isn't that Kim son-in-laws company?

866
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,830
Yea, isn't it?

867
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,720
We put the entire first half of the year's budget into noodle launch,

868
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,890
and in addition, we borrowed from the private loaner

869
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,520
you say Total Recall! I mean...

870
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,690
What are you going to do about this?

871
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:06,400
How can you deal with such improperly run company?

872
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,820
I was trying to reduce the operating budget so we looked for a cheap provider

873
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:13,140
I'm sorry.

874
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,630
Haven't you heard penny-wise and pound-foolish?

875
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,130
How can you be so clueless?

876
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,880
Ayyy..

877
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,490
Who are you?

878
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,680
What..what is this?

879
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,210
Geum Yong Food is

880
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:31,820
charged with production, distribution, and sales of heavy metal to the market place

881
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,720
hence the court issued a search and seizure warrant.

882
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,140
Eh, what?

883
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,750
From now on, we're going to start search and seizure.

884
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,560
No, no

885
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,800
no, what is this?

886
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,370
Who are you to touch my things?

887
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:46,510
What is this?!

888
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,010
Seriously~

889
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:51,480
For the charge of production, distribution, and sale of heavy metal containing noodle,

890
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,190
the court issued an arrest warrant for Ms. Bang Young Ja.

891
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:59,530
As an accused, you have a right to select a lawyer, you have a right to remain silent

892
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:02,660
you have a right to refuse answers that may be against you.

893
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,320
Aiii..Aigoo, hey!

894
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,390
Mom!!

895
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,360
-Ah! 
 -Mom!

896
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,850
Aigoo, I mean what did I...?

897
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,510
What did I do wrong that I have to--

898
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,230
What is this?

899
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,710
My mom hasn't done anything wrong!

900
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:16,910
We were cheated!

901
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,390
Hey take me instead!

902
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,220
Don't cuff my mom!

903
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,240
What is this?

904
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,190
Hey hey hurry and call the lawyer

905
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,870
Let's go to the police station first.

906
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,730
Ai-ya! 
Hey! Hey! Hurry, let's go to the police station.

907
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,030
Mom!

908
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:36,170
Oh my mom hasn't done anything wrong!!
