<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,000
<i>Episode 45</i>

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,030
Under the charge of producing, distributing, and selling the heavy metal containing noodles

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,200
Ms. Bang Yong Ja is under arrest.
Mom!

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,500
Mom...

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,630
Excuse, look here. My mom didn't do anything wrong! Please let her go!

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,150
Ayish, this darn...

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,950
Why the heck are you coming as a flock to take pictures?

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,350
Get away. Get AWAY!

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,830
Mom, Mo-m!

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,690
Uh, we didn't commit any crime...

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,900
Don't cow down. No reason to cow down. Don't cry! Don't cry!!

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,880
We Geum Yoong Food is

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,650
an honest company that even received an excellence award from the minister of commerce.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,450
We were taken by the horrid supplier and cheated. We are the victims here.

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,970
In short time, we will be filing for a damage compensation and

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,410
we will recover the lost integrity of Geum Yoong Foods.

18
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,380
Now, we will reveal details after the investigation,

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,980
Please move aside. Move aside, please!

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,340
U-huh, common.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,340
What do I do if you just take her blindly?

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,630
Mom!

23
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,840
Ai, Mister, where are you going right now, huh?

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,280
Mom, MOM!

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Don't worry too much, as we will resolve this issue after negotiating with the lawyers well.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
I understand, I understand. Don't cry, ok? Don't cry!

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,130
It's all going to work out! 
Yes.

28
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,660
Just wait a little, mom.
It's alright. Our guilt will be removed!

29
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,790
Mom, MOM!

30
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,640
Mom, Mom, MOM!

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,700
Stop taking pictures!

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,420
Hey, Kim Joo Ri!

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,840
Snap out of it!

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,540
All this is because of me...

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,550
What do I do?

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,900
What do we do about our mom?

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,470
She'll be alright.

38
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,620
Mom will be released shortly.

39
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,430
Is this how our family declines?

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,850
What do you mean decline? What bad luck!

41
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,510
It's not like we did this on purpose...

42
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,650
When we are clearly the victim, do you think anything would happen to us?

43
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,600
Don't worry about it. Your brother will take care of everything.

44
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,340
See? You did do it.

45
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,180
Get over here!

46
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,800
I don't have...

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,070
Ms. Bang Young Ja!

48
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,310
Yes.

49
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,920
The mugwort that was supplied to you,

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,990
Did you really not know that they were imported through illegal distribution channel?

51
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,950
Ai, cham.

52
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,490
If we've known it, why would we have received the shipment???

53
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,610
How many times do I have to tell you?

54
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,650
We're also the victim!

55
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,980
In order to get a supply of ldow price mugwort

56
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,760
didn't you ignore the problem even though you were aware?

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,400
Wait a minute, listen to this man.

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,200
How many times did I tell you?

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,880
I told you that we received the certification that proved the quality of...Ach!

60
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,190
Never mind. I didn't commit any crime so hurry up &amp; investigate!

61
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,620
Hurry up and investigate and let me out quickly.

62
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,940
I am incredibly busy laden with company work!

63
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,530
Right now, I'm not an idle person who can stay put here. Seriously!

64
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,660
Investigate!

65
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,360
It's known that the entire noodle quantity currently in distribution in the market place

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,650
will be recalled then destroyed.

67
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,610
Then, could they receive a criminal penalty as well?

68
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,400
That is yet to be known.

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,020
Good work.

70
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,050
Yes, director.

71
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,680
Yes.

72
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,660
Wedding invitation has arrived.

73
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,070
Wedding invitation you say?

74
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,190
Yes. It's so pretty, director.

75
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,680
<i>If you insist on marrying her til the end,</i>

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,450
<i>I'm going to assume you want to sever our father-son relationship.</i>

77
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,290
<i>And I'll separate from your mom.</i>

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,360
What is this?

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,310
Se Yoon's infant clothing and

80
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,110
the anklet that Abbess has made for him.

81
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,910
And photo album and video that contains memory from Se Yoon's childhood.

82
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,460
They're all things that I've temporarily kept

83
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,300
so I should return them to you.

84
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,140
Your brother-in-law said to Se Yoon

85
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:19,640
if he marries Chae Won then he'll sever his father-son ties and divorce me as well.

86
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,470
What?

87
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,250
All these happenings are due to me

88
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,220
I'm preparing for the worst.

89
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,170
I'm going to follow Se Yoon and your decision

90
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,350
unconditionally.

91
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,380
So you two should discuss what you're going to do

92
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,670
and tell me.

93
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,840
Are you ill somewhere?

94
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,000
You look like you're having a very hard time.

95
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,480
Se Yoon said I

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,360
make him shiver

97
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,930
and am creepy and scary.

98
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,520
I know I deserve to hear words like those 100 no 1000 times

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,780
but when I actually hear it

100
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,520
it breaks my heart.

101
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,060
In the past 30 years

102
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,740
I feel as though my life has become wind-blown sand.

103
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,550
Cruel and pathetic

104
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,130
This is what I'm like.

105
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,480
How audaciously can I say "I'm having a hard time" in front of you?!

106
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,630
I'm sorry...Choon Hee.

107
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,700
I'm going to go first.

108
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,950
Choon Hee

109
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,730
His childhood pictures are all placed in the photo album so I don't have a single one at home.

110
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,170
I forgot to take one out before you came,

111
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,970
do you think it's possible for you to give just one photo of him to me?

112
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,960
I'm sorry, Choon Hee.

113
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,140
Please just give me one picture.

114
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,670
This one is my Se Yoon's 100 day baby picture!

115
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,410
Thank you, Choon Hee.

116
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,280
Truly, thank you.

117
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,820
<i>Common, step, step, step</i>

118
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,670
<i>Sweetheart,</i>

119
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,600
<i>you release your hold and let Se Yoon walk alone.</i>

120
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,020
<i>Don't you think it'd be overdoing it a little?</i>

121
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,050
<i>It's past his 1st birthday, let's give it a try!</i>

122
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,380
<i>Hey Se Yoon, try walking without mommy holding you, ok?</i>

123
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,620
<i>Here you go.</i>

124
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,010
<i>Step, step...Oh.</i>

125
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,260
<i>Oh, Se Yoon. Are you okay? Oh.</i>

126
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,350
<i>My baby, does it hurt?</i>

127
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,790
<i>That boy. Who do you take after to be such a crybaby?! Hah hah.</i>

128
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,910
<i>Did he say "crybaby" to our prince?</i>

129
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,870
<i>We don't like you daddy. Ddatchi (soft slap, pretend smack)</i>

130
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,990
<i>Oh ho. Bad daddy.</i>

131
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,300
<i>Ai such a good boy. You stopped crying so quickly.</i>

132
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,330
<i>Isn't he a good boy?</i>

133
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,220
<i>Se Yoon!
Wah...</i>

134
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,680
Chae Won! Chae Won!

135
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,130
I don't think things are going well.

136
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,560
What is?

137
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,500
That rascal Son-in-Law Kim's company.

138
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,010
They keep coming on the news

139
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,820
saying that the police took away the President.

140
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,700
What?

141
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,820
Open the door!

142
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,560
Open it! Open the door!

143
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,740
Hey! Do you even know who you put in here?

144
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,710
I'm Keum Ryeong Food's President

145
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,060
Bang Young Ja!

146
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,620
Hey!

147
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,780
Aiyoo.

148
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,320
If you keep being rowdy it won't go well for you.

149
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,820
I-I

150
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,090
am not able to breathe so I'm getting sick.

151
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,880
Let me out.

152
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,270
I'm not ashamed to face the heaven. I'm an innocent person!

153
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,860
We have more to investigate still so wait quietly, please.

154
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,250
What are you people doing locking up an innocent person here, huh?

155
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,870
I'm not an idle person who can just stay put here.

156
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,820
Me getting out of here is the only way I can work through all the backlog at my company!

157
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,510
Oh, hey!

158
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,080
How can you just leave?

159
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,850
Hey! Open the door!

160
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,970
You're so loud!

161
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,000
Ah, seriously.

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,030
Please look at you rotten...

163
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,600
What are you people saying?

164
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,150
What?

165
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,080
What do you think you're saying? I'm saying let's get some sleep!

166
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,380
You want a piece of me?

167
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,340
Be quiet!

168
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,770
Even if our non-involvement with the supplier is proven

169
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,460
it'll be difficult to avoid the administrative action from managerial negligence.

170
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,650
If you're saying administrative action, what type of things are you talking about, Counsel?

171
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,160
According to the Food Sanitation Regulations, you can receive 1 month production halt

172
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,200
destruction of all involved products

173
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,900
and have no choice but to receive 1 month of operation suspension.

174
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,480
Yes!

175
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,170
There's a big problem.

176
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,320
What is it this time?

177
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,960
Amongst the Green Noodle consumers, anti-Geum Yoong Food activism has started and

178
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,750
stock market also

179
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,510
This seems to be serious.

180
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,280
What?

181
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,440
Welcome.

182
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,710
Um.

183
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,400
Please give me a pregnancy test.

184
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,620
A pregnancy test?

185
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,350
My daughter

186
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,390
has gotten married not long ago.

187
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,790
It seems like she's pregnant so she asked me to buy her a pregnancy test.

188
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,780
Yes, just a moment.

189
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,780
Please give me medicine for headache and stress-relief.

190
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,410
What brings you here at the pharmacy?

191
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,070
Yeah.

192
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,930
Should be in full honeymoon phase, what business would he have in the pharmacy?

193
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,310
Here is the pregnancy test.

194
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,150
Ah, yes.

195
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,490
A pregnancy test?

196
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,170
It's not confirmed,

197
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,360
so we have to take the pregnancy test.

198
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,680
Oh my god!

199
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,070
Get back to your senses, Hyungnim!

200
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,480
What should we do?

201
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,290
Even though the pregnancy test has directions on it, two lines means that she is pregnant.

202
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,570
Please tell your daughter so she is not confused.

203
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,670
Yes.

204
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,400
Daughter?

205
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,840
Aigoo, man.

206
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,710
Honey.

207
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,600
You bought it?

208
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,750
Here.

209
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,500
What brings you two here?

210
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,760
Aiyoo.

211
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,120
You're going at the speed of light.

212
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,410
It hasn't been long since you've left and you're using those.

213
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,580
That's right.

214
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,740
Is this a honeymoon baby or something like that sister-in-law?

215
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,380
Why did you bring them?

216
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,260
I met them at the pharmacy, so don't worry.

217
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,650
Let's go.

218
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,820
Aiyoo, hey!

219
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,330
Where do you think you're going with her?

220
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,420
My mind's in a hurry and I'm curious-

221
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,660
My my. Know your place.

222
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,880
Just wait out here!

223
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,030
You're senseless. Senseless!

224
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,740
Why are you clucking your tongue?

225
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,370
You should have been careful before!

226
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,390
How could you do this without thinking?

227
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,960
Without thought?

228
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,640
Aigoo. When you marry, aren't you supposed to have a baby?

229
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,280
Oh my goodness, you're too greedy!

230
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,580
This is really unbelievable!

231
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,130
Don't you know how old you are? Where do you get off thinking you're going to get an off-spring?

232
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,910
What are you going to do now?

233
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,890
Ah, really.

234
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,300
Aren't you two overreacting right now?

235
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,400
Overreacting?!

236
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,970
Even though we are family,

237
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,140
you shouldn't be putting your nose in every single private matter of a married couple.

238
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,610
Mind your own business! What's the matter with you?

239
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,980
Ah, really.

240
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,470
Did the results come out?

241
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,180
About being pregnant...

242
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,070
I am.

243
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,950
What?

244
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,600
It had two lines?

245
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,360
Look. It's two lines!

246
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,790
You worked hard!

247
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,380
You really worked hard, Honey!

248
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,200
You've worked harder!

249
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,490
Aiyoo.

250
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,490
Two lines!

251
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,440
It's total fast lane for them...

252
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,520
Yeah.

253
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,870
They're really going at it at top speed!

254
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,370
Hey, at the pharmacy,

255
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,930
they said if it's two lines,

256
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,690
it's confirmed!

257
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,820
You've worked hard.

258
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,050
Pregnant?

259
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,240
Does that mean you have a baby?

260
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,700
Mother-in-Law.

261
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,860
We've gone to the hospital

262
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,720
and confirmed it on our way here.

263
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,600
Aigoo, my head! Aigoo, my head!

264
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,080
Please take a tranquilizer for right now, Mother.

265
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,470
To be prepared for an emergency I bought this at the pharmacy earlier.

266
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,910
aiyoo, aiyoo.

267
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,130
Aigoo, aigoo. 
Here you go.

268
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,650
I have to say that you are talented.

269
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,770
You're putting the final nails on it so this family has no where to run.

270
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,160
You...99 tailed,

271
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,420
old WEASEL!

272
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,330
I should have cut off the tails on that butt first.

273
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,670
O-ho.

274
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,870
What o-ho?

275
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,750
How old is that old gigolo that he is producing a baby?

276
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,800
I guess he can wear Depends when the child enters college.

277
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Such problem children that always cause problems without ever having any backup plan.

278
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,770
Aigoo.

279
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,280
Where are you going mid-conversation?

280
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,710
I'm going to have to go lie down.

281
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,330
My head feels like it's exploding just with Chae Won's issue but Gi Ok that wench is adding to it

282
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,940
I feel like my head is going to "Boom" explode!

283
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,830
Aigoo Mother-in-law!

284
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,890
Aigoo, Aigoo.

285
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,910
Aigoo, aigoo. Let me die!

286
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,580
What about Chae Won?

287
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,210
Did something happen to Chae Won?

288
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,160
Oh, I'm hungry. Get the meal ready.

289
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,300
You said you didn't have any appetite earlier.

290
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,020
Since my blood pressure rises quickly, a sudden hunger strikes me.

291
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,350
Hurry.

292
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,510
Uh, okay.

293
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,570
Aiyoo, hungry.

294
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,660
What's the matter?

295
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,160
Oh I forgot.

296
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,970
I said I'd contact the collaborators and I forgot.

297
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,470
Everyone's leaving me out. Isn't this a little harsh?

298
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,260
Congratulations.

299
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
Thank you, Father-in-law.

300
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,500
I'll do my best and

301
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,100
raise him to be the best.

302
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,880
Now that you're not caring just for yourself,

303
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,100
you need to be careful of mind and body.

304
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,210
Yes, father.

305
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,940
Now you've got one more mouth to feed,

306
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,890
you need to take better care of your health.

307
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,300
I still have another 50 years without a problem, father-in-law!

308
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,160
Mom,

309
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,060
Mom,

310
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,630
Uh, Chae Won.

311
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,280
What are you thinking about so seriously?

312
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,130
I called you out several times.

313
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

314
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,350
I was thinking about something.

315
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,510
You mean, thoughts about Se Yoon?

316
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,870
I saw you watching the video earlier.

317
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,650
It looked like Se Yoon's childhood...

318
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,580
I met Seol Joo during the day.

319
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,760
Then did mother-in-law give you those?

320
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,890
I'm not sure what she was thinking

321
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,580
but she gave me Se Yoon's childhood photo album and video tape.

322
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,700
I see.

323
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,130
You're quite upset, right?

324
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:57,190
In the end, I feel I've become an obstacle in your path to the future,

325
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,000
so I can't face you or your dad from guilty thoughts.

326
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,680
That's nonsense.

327
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,570
How can you say "obstacle"?

328
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,380
It the end, it's come to that.

329
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,010
If only I didn't marry your dad,

330
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,770
you two wouldn't have had any problems.

331
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:23,590
Also, if I didn't appear in front of Se Yoon,

332
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,190
he also wouldn't have suffered heartaches.

333
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,810
Come to think of it now,

334
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,000
I shouldn't have returned home.

335
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,700
Why do you say things like that?

336
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,100
If dad heard you he'd be so sad.

337
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,770
What would be an optimum situation for you two is what this mom is

338
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,810
agonizing over right now.

339
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,550
So just wait a little longer for me.

340
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,920
<i>Se Yoon calling</i>

341
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,960
It's Se Yoon.

342
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,190
Go ahead and take it.

343
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,280
Hello?

344
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,370
It's me.

345
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,250
Uh. Right.

346
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,070
Can you make some time for me this evening?

347
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,570
Today?

348
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,930
You're home now Hone...

349
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,340
Where is Seyoon?

350
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,700
He must of had an appointment.

351
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,430
He sent text saying he'd be a little late.

352
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:12,030
I met with Choon Hee

353
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,030
I met her and handed over all Se Yoon's childhood things.

354
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,570
Album, video, and

355
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,060
What's your intent in handing all those things to Choon Hee sister-in-law?

356
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,590
Let's just let Se Yoon go comfortably.

357
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,310
You just do everything the way you want alone!

358
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,760
In your eyes do I look laughable to you.

359
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,720
Honey...

360
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,000
If you bring home a stolen child, I act the fool and become it's daddy,

361
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,610
if you say let's release Se Yoon then I have to act the fool once again and say go with peace,

362
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,250
wave goodbye is all I have to do?

363
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,100
That's not what I meant.

364
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,760
I cannot give up on Seyoon.

365
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,020
Whether it be 30 years ago or now

366
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,420
he's the one to lead our group and continue our family to next generation.

367
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:19,050
Therefore, meet with Choon Hee sister-in-law and make it clear.

368
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,090
What are you saying that I need to

369
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,640
make clear?

370
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,810
Make sure she promises that she will not get involved in legal matters.

371
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,330
You... Aren't you being too harsh?!

372
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:34,250
How could you say those things to Choon Hee?

373
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,540
Do you think you have the right to say that kind of words to me?

374
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,650
Honey!

375
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,550
It's an unfortunate thing for Sister-in-law Choon Hee, but I have no choice.

376
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,420
It's a problem you have started, so you end it.

377
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,600
That 's

378
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,650
like killing Choon Hee a second time.

379
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,730
I'd rather die than

380
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,310
do that.

381
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,450
You waited for long, haven't you?

382
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,350
I'm sorry.

383
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,950
There was some traffic due to rush-hour.

384
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,990
You waited for long, huh?

385
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,540
Mother, you waited 30 years.

386
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,170
I had a mother who waited for me for 30 years,

387
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,170
how could I not wait 30 minutes.

388
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,660
Seyoon

389
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,450
Thank you

390
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,360
What a foolish mom who's lost her son,

391
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,650
what a stupid mom... I was worried that you'd curse and blame me.

392
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:14,520
As a mom I couldn't even recognize the son she bore herself...

393
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,850
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,590
I'm really sorry.

395
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,750
It wasn't your fault.

396
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:28,700
It's not your fault so please don't feel guilty.

397
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,950
My father, what kind of person was he?

398
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,610
He was a warm person.

399
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,960
He was so bright that he got accepted and was studying in a law school of an Ivy-League college

400
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,400
he had brilliant mind as well.

401
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,380
Then...

402
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,390
how did you two then...?

403
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,590
Your father and I were both orphans

404
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,830
his economic situation was difficult.

405
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,160
Because he didn't have the tuition, he took a leave of absence from school

406
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,670
and he worked part-time at the printing company I was working for.

407
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,030
Because we had so little money,

408
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,700
we couldn't get married properly,

409
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:31,920
but we set up a little house together and were so happy.

410
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,490
Your father was

411
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:42,230
so attentive and tender that

412
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,950
When I saw how you were with Chaewon

413
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:59,240
Honestly, I often thought of your father.

414
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,520
Truthfully Seyoon,

415
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,860
I don't know whether I should,

416
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,050
appear in front of you so rightfully

417
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,070
I feel guilty.

418
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,990
After your dad passed from car accident,

419
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,060
I didn't have confidence in living as a single mom at young age,

420
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,560
I tried to abort while I was pregnant with you,

421
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,960
even visiting a hospital

422
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,790
and taking some pills

423
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,170
I'm

424
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:56,520
I don't have the right to hear you say birth-mother.

425
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,760
If it was such a situation,

426
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,410
you couldn't have done things any differently.

427
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,530
Mom

428
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:22,090
it's not your fault.

429
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,940
Se yoon

430
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:33,600
Hearing you say "mom", my goodness,

431
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:40,260
all the hardened shards piled in my heart for the past 30 years

432
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,340
are at last all melting away, it feels.

433
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,240
Thank you.

434
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,800
For saying "mom" to a person like me who's not qualified to hear it.

435
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,240
Truly, thank you, Se Yoon.

436
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,850
Why do you say things like that?

437
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,260
No matter what anyone says,

438
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:17,610
the person who bore me was you, Mom.

439
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,850
Se Yoon

440
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,160
When did you come?

441
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,620
A little while ago.

442
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,530
You should say you came, when you come,

443
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,080
why are you staying like that?

444
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,230
If I say I came, I thought you may shoo me away.

445
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:31,570
Today, I want to look at your face for a long time, Chae Won.

446
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,500
Did you talk with mom alright?

447
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,510
She cried a lot.

448
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,830
Of course,

449
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,190
if one wants to vent one's 30 year long regrets,

450
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,570
I think she'll be crying for much longer still.

451
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,580
No matter what I'm going to get married on the date we planned.

452
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:23,570
You know it's not a matter that can be resolved by insist like that.

453
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,010
Se Yoon and mom's relationship has become known to the world,

454
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,850
how can we get married?

455
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,020
There's nothing that would be a problem.

456
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,760
Our wedding will happen as planned.

457
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,310
Don't be unreasonable.

458
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:40,360
Then treat wedding ceremony as non-existent?

459
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,240
I can never do that.

460
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,420
The wedding will happen as we planned.

461
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,540
Se Yoon, Se Yoon!

462
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,850
Next on the news

463
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,900
Geum Yoon Food's Green Noodle had a total recall as large quantity of lead and cadimum etc. heavy metal were detected

464
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,470
The police started the seize and search on Geum Yoong.

465
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:28,220
Investigation shows Geum Yoong Co used low priced supplier to cut cost
What's that? Kim hubby's captured on camera!

466
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,690
this...has been discovered.
Right. Big problem's happening.

467
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,410
It was decided that all noodles distributed to the marketplace will be recalled.

468
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,420
Consumer's anti-purchase activism started and stock price dropped.

469
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,080
Isn't Kim hubby's company failing at this rate?

470
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,080
Chaewon ,Chaewon 
 come over here and take a look at the news.

471
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,820
In-law mother and Kim hubby's faces are on TV as big as a door!

472
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,420
Hurry!

473
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,500
Please move away! Move away!

474
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,200
<i> Mom. Mom. Mom.</i>

475
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,430
Son-in-law Kim, that rascal, what's he going to do? A mama's boy who can't do a thing without his mommy?

476
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,970
Like you said. He looks like he lost half his senses.

477
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,550
These people who play with consumable food should get punished!

478
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,650
Aiyoo, that mama boy, tsk..

479
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,190
Aiyoo, aigoo, I can't be staying here with both my hands idle, aiyoo.

480
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,670
Aiyoo, my innards are gonna burst. I'm going to go mad!

481
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:34,820
Aigoo, what in the world are Counsel Hong, Cheol Gyoo, and Joo Ri doing anyway?

482
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,860
Aigoo.
You really are getting on my nerves!

483
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,660
All day long what are you so busy with? I can't even sleep!

484
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:48,890
Aigoo, this rotten cabbage, you wench, how can you be bitching about sleep all day?

485
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,980
Did you come to jail to sleep? Is this a motel room?

486
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,140
I'm pissed off as is and how dare you start a fight with me, you fishwife?

487
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:01,270
This...this.. Have you considered who I might be before you start with me?

488
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,830
What do I care who you are?

489
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:09,550
This... this...did you only eat trashy food, where do you get off talking disrespectfully to me?

490
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,260
this...this how in the world...

491
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,210
Miss Bang Young Ja

492
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,260
Uh uh... mme me me

493
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,540
Mom you must have suffered. It was a hard day wasn't it?

494
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,130
Well for me who's suffered through this that and every possible thing, this is nothing.

495
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,990
I'm sorry Mom, It's all my fault.

496
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:55,690
At this stage, nit picking over who was wrong, has no point.

497
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,030
What about the stock price?

498
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,270
It's almost at the bottom.

499
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,080
This...

500
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,650
It's not only the noodle products, but

501
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,010
the dairy products and processed food product sales have also sharply declined.

502
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,540
and also

503
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,400
and also what else?

504
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,680
A message came from the bank.

505
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,830
From the bank ?

506
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,980
They said they can't postpone the date for the loan payment.

507
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,430
They think we're going out of business.

508
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,970
This is wrong. If they're like this, it will be difficult.

509
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,810
Lawyer Hong

510
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,550
Come with me to the office and we'll discuss this.

511
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,260
Ah...

512
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:44,610
You and Joo Ri go home. I have something to discuss with Lawyer Hong.

513
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,610
Does she have a secret with Lawyer Hong.

514
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,380
I'm angry. I'm so angry that I want to die.

515
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,650
What is it now?

516
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,940
I really meant to revenge on Sunbae Se Yoon. How do we look now?!

517
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,510
Is that the issue at hand? The company's about to blow.

518
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,480
When are you going to come to your senses?

519
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,320
Don't bother me!

520
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,610
Okay

521
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,250
You're late

522
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,520
Yes

523
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,710
Good night

524
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,730
Chae Won's mom...

525
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,820
You met with her?

526
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,480
I saw your text.

527
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,340
I thought you were coming home after having dinner with Chae Won's mom.

528
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,030
Right.

529
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,990
Mom...

530
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,590
I met her, and we had dinner and talked.

531
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,130
Ok... Ok.

532
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,000
Now... She's not just Chae... Won's mom.
 You have to call her mom.

533
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:08,210
I'm sorry. I was not thinking.

534
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,960
Go to sleep please.

535
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,940
<i>♫ You're becoming more distant from me.</i>

536
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,600
<i>♫ Your love is becoming more distant.</i><b><i>Mom is probably having a hard time just like me.</i></b>

537
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:37,030
<i>♫ We still have a lot to say to each other.</i><b><i></i>I don't why I only say cruel things to her.</b>

538
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,470
<i>♫ I should hate you</i>

539
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,100
<i>♫ because you left me.</i>

540
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:49,950
<i>♫ I shouldn't think about you because we have parted ways.</i>

541
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,860
<i>The whole world knows about the relationship between you and your mom. How can we marry?</i>

542
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,900
<i>Then, are you saying we should pretend that marriage plans never occurred?</i>

543
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,220
<i>I'm making this very clear to you.
I will never be able to do that.</i>

544
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:14,580
<i>♫ In your eyes...</i> <i>♫ I'm right here.</i><b><i>♫ If I could only go back into</i></b>

545
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:19,580
<i>♫ your heart again...</i>

546
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,340
Why are you coming back so late when you only out to urinate?

547
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:33,170
I thought you fell and got hurt in the restroom, so I was about go out to check.

548
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,530
Honey.

549
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:42,120
They say life is a pilgrimage from birth to death.
We become food for frogs in the water.

550
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,590
They say we're dew on the grass.

551
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,960
What is this Confucius and Mencius in the middle of the night?

552
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,970
There is nothing much to life.

553
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:59,020
Leave Chae Won and Ki Ok to do whatever they want to do.

554
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,310
You became a living buddha.

555
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,560
Don't just bicker.

556
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,310
Se Won's biological mom is Chae Won's stepmom, do you still want them to get married?

557
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,260
Even though they don't share a drop of blood, they are still siblings.

558
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,020
If others were to find out, what would they say?

559
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,820
There is no use of paying attention to what others say.

560
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:26,500
Then, do you want to applaud the old man who is almost 60 years old and Ki Ok who's living with him?

561
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,030
She's even pregnant, what can we do?

562
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,930
Because you have a good heart, everything might be okay for you.

563
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,290
I'm not so nice, so I can't ever do that.

564
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,290
Her view of the world...

565
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,720
Hello, Father-in-law.

566
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,860
Long time no see, Brothers-in-law.

567
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,970
You, old gigolo, how did you get here?

568
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,200
What do you want to gain?!

569
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,790
Why are you getting mad so early in the morning, Hyungnim?

570
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:18,810
Father-in-law called me early in the morning. I slept very little, and rushed over here.

571
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,320
Father, did you call him?

572
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,890
Alright. This morning, the Uhm men will have a rally to strengthen our unity.

573
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,280
Let's have refreshing baths, and part after having a bowl of pollack soup.

574
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,930
Father-in-law, let's get going please.

575
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,090
That... that... gigolo...

576
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,560
I don't want to soak in the same public bathtub with him.

577
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,730
You're being childish. Let's just go in.

578
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,670
Let's go in.

579
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,610
Thinking on it, I feel we have a good thing

580
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:01,830
The three generations being able to soak together in this bath.

581
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,950
I'm grateful.

582
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:08,250
These days, people don't want to be burdened by their old parents.

583
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,050
Thanks to my children who came back to carry on the family business.

584
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,330
The last years of my life...

585
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,310
I couldn't be any happier.

586
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,860
I owe you a big debt that I can't even pay back from heaven.

587
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,540
Why do you talk like that, Father-in-law?

588
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,910
Yeah... The factory is running well. We even get royalties from a large company.

589
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,080
Now, you only have things that will make you happy.

590
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,040
Of course. When I see Father naked, he looks like a sixty year old. It's believable.

591
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:46,650
When I look at his good posture and build, he looks the same as 20 years ago. He didn't age a bit.

592
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,820
Aye

593
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,030
don't talk nonsense.

594
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,800
Nonsense? I'm saying it's true!

595
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,560
Yes, it's true.

596
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,250
Look here son in law.

597
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,660
Yes, father in law.

598
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:05,050
Don't get too upset by Chae Won's matter. You should take care of it the way it's meant to be.

599
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,770
Yes, that's what I should do.

600
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,090
My oldest son, Uhm Ki Moon...

601
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,150
Yes Father?

602
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,750
Don't be too greedy for money.

603
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:20,300
Starting from a long time ago, noodles have been meant to satisfy hungry stomachs. It a food to be thankful for.

604
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:26,470
You have to make them without greed, just with warm heart and hands.

605
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,280
Yes.

606
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,630
I will keep that in mind.

607
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,320
My youngest son, Uhm Ki Choon...

608
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,640
Yes, sir!

609
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,270
Don't treat your brother-in-law badly.

610
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,210
Pass the time together well.

611
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,610
Father!

612
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:48,650
If General Uhm acknowledged him, you, Private, should just follow me without a word.

613
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,800
Son in law Kang

614
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,030
Yes Father in law

615
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,430
You made a promise together with me, that you have another fifty years ahead of you.

616
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:04,670
Yes, don't have a single concern.
 I have the confidence to do it.

617
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,000
Yes, then that will do.

618
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,500
Who will scrub Grandpa's back?

619
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,490
-I will.
- I will.

620
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,670
Ah now...

621
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,000
Because of my two grandkids, I'm being well taken care of.

622
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Let's go.

623
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,810
Make it refreshing.

624
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:27,530
Today, there's something strange about Father-in-law.

625
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,900
If it weren't for me,

626
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,350
the kids' wedding would have

627
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,200
happened tomorrow just as planned.

628
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,010
It seems like Miss is suffering a lot from morning sickness.

629
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,420
Shouldn't you go check on her Mother in law,

630
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,380
No, it doesn't matter. She's doesn't care about her mother and father at all.

631
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,150
Really, what's the beauty in that? Leave it be.

632
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,310
Hello, did you sleep well?

633
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:22,920
Didn't you get any sleep? Your face is getting haggard more each day.

634
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,860
I had to do a lot of work concerning the factory.

635
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,020
Where's Grandfather?

636
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,490
Grandfather along with all the Uhm men went to the bathhouse,

637
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:35,500
and will return after eating pollack soup. This morning, let's just the women eat.

638
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,840
I don't have an appetite.

639
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,770
I'm going to the factory.

640
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:44,530
If you don't have the inclination, what's with that ? Hey, Chae Won dear.

641
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,850
Leave her alone Mother in law.

642
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,800
If we didn't have that problem, tomorrow would have been her wedding day. She must be upset.

643
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,120
Even if she eats, will her food sit well?

644
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:00,410
Oh my, I should have died before seeing these things happen.

645
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,420
Aigoo.

646
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,450
For having the wrong parent,

647
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,730
the kids will suffer for the rest of their lives.

648
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,870
Aigoo.

649
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,370
Did he leave for work already?

650
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,640
"Please celebrate our love with us" Groom: Yi Se Yoon, Bride: Min Chae Won, Date, Time, Location...

651
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,320
How did it go?

652
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:18,840
I met with the president of the bank. I begged him to postpone the loan payment date just once.

653
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,470
I couldn't persuade him.

654
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,260
Oh, the rottenness

655
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,870
Come in.

656
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,140
The promissory note we have to cover today is W50 billion.

657
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,620
What?

658
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:38,580
If we cannot cover the promissory note today that's preliminary bankruptcy, Chairman.

659
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,280
Let's sell our shares that should prevent for now Mom.

660
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,940
Stop talking nonsense!

661
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:51,750
How can we sell the shares and cover the promissory note when the value of our company share has become tissue long ago?

662
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,630
Then, maybe the cash we have...
Ah!

663
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:55,850
That's enough.

664
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:58,270
Take leave.

665
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,730
Yes, Chairman.

666
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:09,860
Don't we have plenty of cash and gold bullion in our home vault? Why not just take those to the bank and...

667
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,000
Please. Please Please.
 Just keep your mouth shut.

668
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,030
Even though we should try our best to cover the notes, don't we have to find a way to survive too?

669
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,490
The way for us to survive is to request the walk out (defaulting on the loan possibly) and

670
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:31,510
If that occurs, you and I will be thrown out first. Understand? Got it? Knowing that, you're still babbling now?

671
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,140
No. I'll never give up on our company.

672
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,260
Aigoo aigoo aigoo.

673
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,910
Aigoo, that reckless simpleton who doesn't know a thing about the way of the world!

674
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,000
Aigoo aigoo.

675
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,210
Where's Lawyer Hong?

676
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,860
We just parted company.

677
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,890
Firstly, he said he'd sell everything in our name and turn it into cash

678
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,620
Ok.

679
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,910
Savings, you told him to withdraw it all, right?

680
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,020
Of course.

681
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,270
By the way,

682
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,360
What are you doing here?

683
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,990
Hello.

684
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,060
You're Kang Sook's Unnie (older sister), right?

685
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,610
Unnie?

686
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:33,470
I saw you that time at the cabaret. Don't you remember me?

687
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,500
You have a visitor outside.

688
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,500
Who is the guest?

689
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,280
The man we meet at the cabaret.

690
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,150
Hey! What's this about?!

691
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,420
I'm going out for a while, don't tell Boreum's father anything.

692
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,230
Something smells fishy.

693
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:05,230
What are you talking about, smell? He's just an oppa I used to know from school

694
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,380
Is that all?

695
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,350
And if it's not all?

696
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:10,650
The why are you telling me not to tell Boreum's father?

697
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,600
It's not even a big deal. I'm just afraid he will misunderstand.

698
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,060
With Chae Won's case also. Hyungnim, that...

699
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,050
that mouth of yours is your flaw, you know that, right?

700
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,850
I'll only be gone for 30 minutes.

701
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,190
Something really smells (fishy).

702
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,170
Where did that person go?

703
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,750
Uh...someone came by to visit her.

704
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:38,830
A guest?

705
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,230
Yes.

706
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,760
Oppa.

707
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,140
I'm not bothering a busy person am I?

708
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,980
No. What are you doing here without calling first Oppa?

709
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:02,180
I didn't have that much to do today. I thought we might have lunch together. Also to return this kimchi container.

710
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,190
Yes.

711
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,410
My Kang Sook, not only you're pretty, but you're good with your hands.

712
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:12,690
I was really moved.

713
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,560
Oppa, for something like this...

714
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,310
Boreum's Mom.

715
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,270
Kang Sook!

716
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,650
What's going on?
 Shhhhhhhh

717
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:29,930



718
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,280
Boreum's Mom

719
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,090
Kang Sook!

720
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,560
Boreum's Mom?

721
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:43,060
I had a son with my ex husband.
His name is Bo Reum.

722
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,850
Oh

723
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,460
Then who is that guy?

724
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,010
He's my brother.

725
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,260
Then why are you hiding?

726
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:57,070
My family is kind of strict.
If they find out a man visited...

727
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,700
things will get complicated.

728
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,210
Aaaahhhh

729
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,590
Kang Sook!

730
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,630
I brought you some strawberries.

731
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,620
I washed them out in the yard. Get up and eat one, hurry, Honey.

732
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,570
Thanks.

733
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,090
Here, here, ahh.

734
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,270
What's wrong again?

735
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,410
Ug, the smell of the strawberry is making me nauseous.

736
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,470
Is there anything spicy?

737
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,380
I want to eat Soon Dae soup, Honey.

738
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,350
Soon Dae soup?

739
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,630
Oppa, you know how to eat this too?

740
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,840
Of course!

741
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,960
I really enjoy Soon Dae soup.

742
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,520
How can even his taste in food could be so easy going?

743
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,780
Doesn't even make smacks his mouth as he eats, like somebody I know.

744
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,240
a genuine gentleman, he is.

745
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,580
Boerum's mom. Older sister.

746
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,090
What are you happen to be doing here?

747
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:16,750
This person all of a sudden wanted to eat soon dae soup.

748
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:19,890
President, what are you doing in this neighborhood?

749
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,550
I came by to share lunch with Gang Sook.

750
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:27,910
By the way, does that make Gang Sook Mr. Gang Jin's Cheu Hyung (wife's elder sister)?

751
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,530
Cheo Hyung?

752
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:33,560
Of course.

753
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,290
That's correct.

754
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,050
But,

755
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,550
the sisters don't look alike at all.

756
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,190
Hey there, there is something I've been curious about.

757
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,580
why aren't you married?

758
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:57,990
From the past having broken up, I'm now meeting again my first love.

759
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,800
Your first love?

760
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,640
I only trust you, Attorney Hong.

761
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,820
So I hope you take good care of the problem.

762
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:18,570
My family's survival depends on you, Attorney Hong.

763
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,310
You got it?!

764
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,680
Yes, okay, okay.

765
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,020
I understand. We'll connect again tomorrow.

766
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:45,810
Mom

767
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:46,830
Mom, mom.

768
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,470
Yes.

769
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,690
How did it go?

770
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,660
How do you think?

771
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,250
Who am I?

772
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,890
Quit the smack talk.

773
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,820
What has happened?

774
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,710
I submitted the extension to the bank so

775
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,570
it won't become a preliminary bankruptcy until tomorrow 10AM.

776
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,780
Is that so?

777
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,850
You worked hard.

778
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,610
I shouldn't have just left it up to Mom and Joo Ri.

779
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,820
I should have gotten involved with the company affairs a long time ago.

780
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:23,230
Then, something like this wouldn't have happened.

781
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,620
<i>You'll be assigned to a branch in the U.S.</i>

782
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,630
<i>Be there next month.</i>

783
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,300
<i>Father!</i>

784
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,610
<i>You have to give all you've got for the factory.</i>

785
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:49,940
<i>If you want to get over things fast, I think you should go to the U.S.</i>

786
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,520
<i>I've never told you I would get over Chae Won.</i>

787
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,070
<i>If you don't...</i>

788
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,500
<i>As planned,</i>

789
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,970
<i>we'll get married tomorrow.</i>

790
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:03,000
<i>If you do that, this company...</i>

791
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,980
<i>I can't leave it in your hands.</i>

792
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:30,890
[Resignation]

793
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:57,400
You...

794
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,980
What are you doing right now?

795
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,840
I submitted my resignation.

796
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,440
And, I

797
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,940
will leave home.

798
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,220
Se Yoon!

799
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:22,610
As planned, I will marry Chae Won tomorrow.

800
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,380
You must...

801
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,650
You must do this?

802
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:33,830
No matter how much I think about it, I have no other choice.

803
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,830
Alright.

804
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,400
Go.

805
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:47,160
Since you will be happy,

806
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,160
I don't want to hold you back anymore.

807
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,330
I shouldn't hold you back.

808
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,280
To Chae Won...

809
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,200
tell her that I congratulate you on your wedding.

810
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,970
I am sorry.

811
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,710
Grandfather!

812
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,890
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

813
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:49,020
I came here to kidnap Chae Won right now.

814
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,670
Please give me your permission.

815
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,820
You're going to kidnap her?

816
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,630
No matter what, I can't give up on Chae Won.

817
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:01,500
Because of the elders' past, we can't give up on our future.

818
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:09,210
We'll go down to the countryside. We'll come back after we get married, just the two of us.

819
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,820
Please give us your permission.

820
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,360
Please give us your permission, Grandfather!

821
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,740
Take her.

822
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,230
I give you my permission.

823
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,010
You can kidnap our Chae Won.

824
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,890
Thank you, Grandfather.

825
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,630
What brings you here tonight?

826
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,810
I came to kidnap you.

827
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:55,030
Also, I just got permission from Grandfather.

828
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,050
What are you talking about right now?

829
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,810
You have to go somewhere with me.

830
01:00:58,810 --> 01:00:59,870
Where?

831
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,180
Have you ever heard a kidnapper telling his destination?

832
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,530
Don't ask anything.
just follow me.

833
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:08,890
What are you doing?
Where are we going?

834
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,060
Where are you going right now?

835
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,110
You'll find out when we get there.

836
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,710
Are we going far?

837
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,800
Yes, we're traveling really far.

838
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,680
Where is that place?

839
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,710
It's a place where we can become one with each other.

840
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:29,330
What are you thinking right now?

841
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,550
Perhaps...

842
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,490
You're right.

843
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,640
Why are you acting childish?

844
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,310
This is wrong. You shouldn't do this.

845
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:41,980
Think about the family members who might get hurt because of us.

846
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:44,330
From now on, I won't think about anything else.

847
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:49,290
I will only think about you and me.

848
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,820
What is this place?

849
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:21,110
It's the place where we will get married.

850
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,690
Se Yoon!
