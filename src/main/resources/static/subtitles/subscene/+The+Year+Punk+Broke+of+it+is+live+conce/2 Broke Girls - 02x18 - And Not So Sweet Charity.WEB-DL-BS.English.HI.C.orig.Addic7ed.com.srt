Gimme a hint.

It's here.
Our eviction notice.

It's amazing you can send

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,624
this much shame
for just 46 cents.

six months and you're out?

right there.

Hi, girls.

11
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:30,135

to eat on the way to the gym.

the lemon meringue cupcakes?

Stopped making 'em.

And the fudge berries

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,778
and the purple velvets.

17

We have so many
left over every day

00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,315
that even the homeless lady
I give them to at night

19
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:46,650
was like, "Girl, your shop
in trouble, ain't it?"

20
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,204
So what, Max?

21
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:49,788
You think we should
take business advice

22
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,590
from a woman who thinks
our nation's currency

23
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:54,009
should be the McNugget?

24
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:56,045
She makes a good point.

too real in here for me.

I'm gonna go push up my boobs
and glue my tooth back on.

are we gonna do about this?

if you stay, we would need
six months' rent up front.

00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:50,510
Coming.

175
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,513
That's not my name,

176
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,848
but I'm afraid to tell her.

177
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:01,437
So why doesn't
your aunt like you?

178
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,223
I don't know.
She just doesn't like me.

179
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:06,108
For example,
one time, when I was ten,

180
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,660
and we were at
our Hamptons beach house--

181
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:10,496
I already don't like you.

182
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:13,831
I wanted my night-night cocoa
in my special seagull mug--

183
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,818
Now I hate you.

184
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,620
And my aunt Charity,
who was babysitting

185
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,788
because everybody else
was in Europe

186
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,322
at the dressage competition...

187
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:23,125
Now I've beat you up
and left you for dead.

188
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:27,162
Told me my seagull cup was
broken and I knew it wasn't.

189
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:28,548
And when
I wouldn't stop crying,

190
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,932
she locked me in my bedroom,

191
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:31,333
and when the servants
weren't looking,

192
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:33,052
pulled my hair.

193
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,387
Love her.

194
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:39,609
You can go in now.

195
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,477
It's not that big
a deal, Kevin.

196
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,147
We're launching a lipstick at
Target, not a missile at Iran.

197
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,732
Aunt Charity, hi.

198
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,184
Caroline, look at you.

199
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:52,038
Gorgeous, beautiful.
You stuck with that nose.

200
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,907
Good for you.

201
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,659
And who's this
with the great lips?

202
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,579
Aunt Charity, this is my friend
and business partner, Max.

203
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,130
Nice to meet you.

204
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:02,999
Did she tell you
I pulled her hair?

205
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,668
Oh, it was legend
around the family townhouse.

206
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,136
My brother came into my room.

207
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,871
"Did you pull
my princess's hair?

208
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:10,306
She said
you pulled her hair."

209
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:12,592
I mean, come on.
She's 10, I'm 23.

210
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,560
What, I'm just gonna reach up
and pull her hair?

211
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:16,012
I mean, how would that happen?

212
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,380
Ow.

213
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,182
I mean, who would
just pull a child's hair?

214
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,734
Ow.

215
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:23,236
I mean, come on.
I'm gonna pull her hair?

216
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:24,320
- Ow.
- Pull her hair?

217
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,554
- Ow! Ow!
- Pull her hair?

218
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:26,772
Ow! Okay,
you just pulled my hair.

219
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,107
Oh, my God, here we go again.

220
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,076
Get the lawyers.

221
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:31,327
Come on, have a seat.

222
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:32,445
Have a seat
in the big girl chair.

223
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,681
You're a big girl now.

224
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:38,184
Aunt Charity, thank you
so much for seeing us.

225
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:39,785
I know your time
is very valuable.

226
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,787
I have all the time
in the world for you.

227
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,456
You're family.

228
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,458
Stephanie, I'm not
doing anything important.

229
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,044
Bring me those documents
to sign.

230
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,465
I haven't seen this one since I
was 25 and my parents cut me off.

231
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,016
You sleep with
one Pakistani lesbian,

232
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:56,218
you're out of the family.

233
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,937
Here, you with the big lips,
try these.

234
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:59,438
Tell me which ones you hate.

235
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,924
Aunt Charity started
her makeup empire at 26

236
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:04,060
when she invented
bubblegum-flavored lip gloss.

237
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,945
Oh, my God, that was you?

238
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,396
I loved that.

239
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,098
I was wearing that
during my first kiss.

240
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,433
And thank you, because
I got an "A" in that class.

241
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:15,738
Every girl who loves
lipstick loves me,

242
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,707
except for this one,
who hates me

243
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:20,543
[mocking]
Because I was so mean

244
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:23,278
and I broke
her night-night cocoa cup.

245
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,115
Aunt Charity,
I never said you were mean.

246
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:29,635
I was ten, and I just got a little confused
about what happened to my seagull cup.

247
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:30,786
But I'm an adult now.

248
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:32,171
When I go night-night,

249
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,956
I barely even think
about that cocoa cup.

250
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,225
Caroline, I was 23.

251
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:38,127
I don't remember
anything about a cup.

252
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,646
All I remember about that weekend
was that Versace was murdered

253
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:43,432
and my dress
would obviously be late.

254
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,651
Now, why are you here?

255
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,187
Tell me. You have my full
and undivided attention.

256
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,022
Where and where?

257
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,608
Well, Aunt Charity,
as you may or may not know,

258
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,493
I now have
a start-up business.

259
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:57,828
Hey, is it me, or does
this look like a dog penis?

260
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,784
She's fun.
Seems professional.

261
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,652
Good choice.

262
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,154
And, as you know,

263
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:07,322
I've always respected
your business acumen.

264
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,458
- Even when I was a little--
- How much?

265
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,160
Fine, businesswoman
to businesswoman--

266
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,679
I need a number.
Give me a number.

267
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:15,131
25,000.

268
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,134
And all these lipsticks,

269
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,469
including dog penis.

270
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,472
And I'm not asking
for a handout.

271
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,225
- This is a business opportunity.
- No.

272
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,527
Maybe--no.

273
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,947
Look, Caroline, if this were
truly a business transaction,

274
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:35,282
you'd have cupcakes here
to show me, but you don't.

275
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,986
I know all about
your business.

276
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,154
Stephanie googled you.

277
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,373
She has the strength
to Google?

278
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,708
Has she googled "How to eat"?

279
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:46,962
See yourselves out.

280
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:49,799
I'm going to my dermatologist
for a little procedure.

281
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,667
I want to take two years
off my face

282
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,670
just so people will think,
"Is she 38 or 39?

283
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,538
It's so hard to tell."

284
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,658
But just so you know,
you were my last chance

285
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,011
to keep my dream
and our business alive.

286
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,679
You're resourceful.
You'll think of something.

287
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,880
Now come here.

288
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,048
In spite of it all,
we are family.

289
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,349
Give me a hug.

290
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,717
[Sighs]

291
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:12,052
Ow!

292
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,223
Wow.

293
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,691
She's kind of a monster,

294
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,026
but she gave me free stuff,
so I'm torn.

295
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,406
Aunt Charity's
a smart businesswoman.

296
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,108
She won't be able
to deny a good product.

297
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,843
I can't believe
I'm making cupcakes

298
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,945
so you can go back for round two
with that woman.

299
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:34,015
Auntie Charity
might be the anti-Christ.

300
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,385
I'll do anything
to keep our business going.

301
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,919
And if these cupcakes
don't work,

302
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,271
we'll tell her
you're Pakistani

303
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,189
and let her go after it.

304
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:45,192
Even if you do convince her
to give us the money,

305
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:46,260
that's bitch money.

306
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:47,862
We don't take bitch money.

307
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:51,197
Max, you pick up pennies
off the pee corner.

308
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:55,317
Not true.
Dimes and up.

309
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:00,074
Hi!
We'll just be a second.

310
00:13:00,076 --> 00:13:01,942
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Cool hair, David Bowie.

311
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,161
Okay, she's definitely
not seeing anyone today.

312
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:05,746
Sorry to burst in,
Aunt Charity,

313
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:09,081
but we wanted you to have
some of our cupcakes.

314
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:10,501
[Both scream]

315
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,620
It took two layers
to take off two years,

316
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:15,389
but it was worth it.

317
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,724
Just so you know,
the third layer is bone.

318
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:22,780
Either I'm high,
or my chair melted.

319
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:24,899
Okay, you're high.

320
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,418
She's on morphine lollipops
for the pain.

321
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,753
Really? 'Cause I'd like
to be on one for the fun.

322
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:34,191
♪ I got that boom boom boom ♪

323
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:36,077
♪ I got that boom boom boom ♪

324
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,695
♪ I got that boom boom boom ♪

325
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:40,281
Okay, it's time
to change your face mask.

326
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:42,116
You know what?
Let me do that.

327
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,617
I can help my aunt Charity.

328
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:46,754
I'll do anything
to help someone in my family

329
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,756
because families
help each other.

330
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:49,990
Well, why don't you
help yourself

331
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:53,325
to an adult-sized
pair of boobies?

332
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,714
Like my boobs, like my nose.

333
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:59,100
Okay,
here's the new face mask.

334
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:00,885
You peel the soiled one off,

335
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,971
then swab the affected area
with Q-tips.

336
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,189
And I left modeling

337
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:08,524
because I thought it
was degrading.

338
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,462
- Question, Stephanie.
- Yeah?

339
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:12,730
Do these come
in orange, or lime,

340
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:14,532
or is it just
the white flavor?

341
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:15,450
Ah, screw it.

342
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:18,519
After a couple of licks,
it won't matter.

343
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:20,538
I'm happy to do this for you,
Aunt Charity,

344
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,190
and not just for the money,
but 'cause we're family.

345
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:25,526
I hate you.

346
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:27,161
Always have.

347
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,296
You can't mean that,
Aunt Charity.

348
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:32,631
Up until you were born,
I was the family princess.

349
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:36,086
And then you came in,
and you got the boom boom boom

350
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,139
and you took
my boom boom boom.

351
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:41,474
So I locked you
in a room room room.

352
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:45,394
Well, I'm sorry you think
I took your boom boom boom,

353
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,815
but you really did
take my seagull cup

354
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,183
and lock me in a room.

355
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,684

356
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,237
I'm not giving you any money,
little girl.

357
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,605
Just so you know.

358
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,723
Well,
maybe you'll feel differently

359
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:59,026
after you taste
one of our cupcakes.

a minute for a little bite?

361
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,997
Nope, I don't want it.

362

business investment we are.

00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:09,203
Just--oh--just taste it.

00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,354
Here.

366
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:11,839
Come on, taste--
take a bite.

367
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,841
This is pretty disturbing.

368
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:18,176
I would intervene right now
if I wasn't feeling amazing.

369
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,182

370
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:22,600
Oh, no, no, no, no.

371
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:23,884
No, no, no, that's your face.

372
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:26,187
I think you're
chewing your face.

373
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:29,522
That's the best cupcake
I have ever had,

374
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:33,444
but I am still not
giving you any money.

375
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,229
Why not?
It's the least you could do

376
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,930
after you broke
my seagull cup.

377
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:40,067
Oh, my God, are you still
talking about that seagull cup?

378
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,786
I haven't thought
about that in 15 years.

379
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:45,489
If we're gonna be talking
about that stupid seagull cup,

380
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:48,409
I'm gonna need
another lollipop.

381
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,579
Where does she keep them?

382
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:54,448
Oh, here, they're in this cup
that has a seagull on it.

383

Wait.

Where have I
heard of seagull cup before?

385
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:03,807
That's my
night-night cocoa cup.

00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,426
I knew it wasn't broken.

387
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,628
You hid it and kept it
all these years?

388
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,230
Yep.

389
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:11,465
Why would you want
to hurt me like that?

390
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,100
It's obvious.

391
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,735
She's obsessed
with her brother,

392
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:16,070
and she saw your being born

393
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,656
as his love being
taken away from her.

394
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:21,991
Damn, this thing
makes me smart.
