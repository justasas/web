<i>Episode 49</i>

2
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:13,788
The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident.

3
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:18,382
<i>He is unconscious, and sustained severe trauma to his head and chest.</i>

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,277
<i>Defibrillator!</i>

5
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:27,073
I can't get in touch with you.

6
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:31,104
I... am at the airport right now.

7
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:34,075
Call me as soon as you get this message.

8
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>Shock!</i>

00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:49,550
<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

10
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:53,971
Where have you been with your cell phone turned off?

11
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,041
I was worried about you.

12
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:59,472
I met with Chae Won.

13
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:01,070
What for?

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,761
I met with her, and

15
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:06,579
gave her a plane ticket.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,663
Plane ticket?

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,096
Yes.

18
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,878
By now,

19
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:16,285
they will be sitting side by side on the plane.

20
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,863
Seriously, why are you doing this?

21
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:21,746
What are thinking by doing all of this?

22
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,926
I had to do this.

23
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:28,084
I did it because I feel bad for Se Yoon and Choon Hee.

24
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:32,126
I'm protecting the last bit of conscience I have left.

25
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,079
I feel bad for Chae Won and Choon Hee too, but

26
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,302
all it's not going to get fixed by doing this.

27
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:41,418
Right now you are

28
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:45,014
just making it worse.

29
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:47,905
Let's...

30
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,027
get a divorce.

31
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,453
What?

32
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:52,279
I did this with

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,858
the worst case in my mind.

34
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:56,513
Without any conditions,

35
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:59,423
I'll just do as you wish.

36
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:11,820
Hello.

37
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,526
<i>Is this Lee Se Yoon's residence?</i>

38
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:15,923
Yes, that is right.

39
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:17,699
Who is this?

40
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,406
This is the emergency department of Sae Han Hospital.

41
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:25,748
Emergency room?

42
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:35,524
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

43
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,348
Excuse me,

44
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:42,954
Yes, what can I help you with?

45
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,951
There is a person I'm supposed to be catching a plane with but that person isn't picking up the phone,

46
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,958
Can you check the passenger list?

47
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:52,947
I'm sorry, I can't do that due to the Personal Information Protection Act.

48
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:55,782
I see.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,100
<i> Se Yoon's Mom </i>

50
00:02:59,183 --> 00:03:01,347
Yes, Mother.

51
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:06,498
I'm at the departure gate right now, but we didn't meet yet because I couldn't get in touch with Se Yoon.

52
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,759
What?

53
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,177
Emergency Room?

54
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:14,479
Doctor, Doctor.

55
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,927
Our Se Yoon, What happened to our Se Yoon.

56
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:20,732
He had a cardiac arrest when he arrived to the emergency room.

57
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:23,950
After receiving immediate treatment, heart function has been restored.

58
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,729
How in the world...?

59
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,156
Then, is he alright now?

60
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:35,175
Due to trauma from the car accident, his blood vessels ruptured and blood has accumulated in the subdural space.

61
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:40,179
If he doesn't get the blood clot removed surgically, then it could kill him.

62
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,716
Then, can he recover if he gets the surgery?

63
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:47,787
The outcome is poor if it's an acute subdural hemorrhage.

64
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:50,149
Though it varies depending on the type.

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,100
Even with surgical interventions, 60% of patients could die.

66
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:56,373
Honey...

67
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:58,524
No... It can't happen...

68
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:00,169
That can't be Doctor, it can't.

69
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,953
Please save our Se Yoon.

70
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:05,763
It can't, I beg of you doctor.

71
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:08,740
I'll do my best.

72
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:25,972
Mother!

73
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:28,325
What about Se Yoon.

74
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:30,412
Surgery...right now...

75
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:33,129
Surgery...started...

76
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:37,416
<i> Subtitles brought to you by the Inheritance team @Viki </i>

77
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,672
I'm sorry...

78
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:44,046
I should have gone to you a little earlier, Se Yoon.

79
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,610
Give me another chance...

80
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,593
One more, Please Se Yoon.

81
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:14,893
Please speed up more.

82
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:15,856
Hurry.

83
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,029
Let's go there fast.

84
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,805
I'm going as fast as I can.

85
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,872
I'm sorry, Se Yoon.

86
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,690
I'm being a burden to you to the end.

87
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,550
It's all my fault,

88
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,968
If I hadn't called him...

89
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:34,328
This accident wouldn't have happened.

90
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:37,708
Why did I do something that I wasn't even told?

91
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,816
It's not your fault, so

92
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,300
don't blame yourself. It's not your fault.

93
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,320
Wait for me, Se Yoon.

94
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,006
Mom is on her way, wait..

95
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:08,593
Chae Won!

96
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:09,788
Mom.

97
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:12,093
Se Yoon. What about Se Yoon.

98
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:14,479
He is in surgery right now.

99
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,563
What did the Doctor say?

100
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:19,811
Will he be fine after the surgery?

101
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:24,525
He'll be alright, right Unni?

102
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:30,387
If he just receives the surgery, he'll be fine. Right Brother-in-law?

103
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,361
Choon Hee.

104
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,759
What is it?

105
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,815
Is it very serious?

106
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:42,986
All he needs is the surgery, right?

107
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,662
We arrived at your house safely, sir.

108
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,651
Yes...You've worked very hard.

109
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,047
The world is quite small.

110
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,774
You and me used to be neighbors.

111
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:12,667
Until recently, I lived in this neighborhood.

112
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:16,527
My house was right next to yours.

113
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,639
You're lying too much.

114
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,194
Why would someone who used to live in this neighborhood be a substitute driver?

115
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,608
Yes, well I...

116
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:28,717
because of personal reasons it just turned out that way.

117
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,514
You've worked hard.

118
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:33,083
Yes, please go inside.

119
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:47,743
My bedroom is lit up brightly.

120
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,308
Did someone move in already?

121
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:24,291
Coco,

122
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,233
mom is having a hard time so stay still.

123
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,325
Agashi.

124
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,842
Mrs. Park!

125
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,445
Welcome back, Agashi.

126
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:39,537
You're not even alone. You had a hard time, right?

127
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,832
Do you know what a good baby this is in my womb?

128
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,600
As soon as I got on the plane, I slept soundly.

129
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:46,164
When did you come, Mrs. Park?

130
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:49,149
I came a while ago. I cleaned the house,

131
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:51,776
went to the market, and made kimchi.

132
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:54,589
I missed your Kimchi so much Mrs. Park.

133
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,234
This is great.

134
00:08:56,797 --> 00:09:00,470
How is your Mom?

135
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,030
She's better.

136
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,820
She can sleep without sleeping medicine.

137
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,200
And she laughs once in a while.

138
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,799
That is a relief.

139
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,070
I'm hungry.

140
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,410
Aigoo, look at me.

141
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,177
Let's go inside, quickly.

142
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:15,955
Coco.

143
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,704
Something bad can happen!

144
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,588
What would happen if you take so many pills at once?

145
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:36,349
I'm so burning up inside! What should I do then?!

146
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:38,885
Something bad can happen, Mom!

147
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,525
Death is the worst thing that can happen.

148
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,078
Leave me alone.

149
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:55,080
Why are you suddenly crying?

150
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,453
When you say things like that, my heart feels like it will burst.

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,161
If it wasn't for me, you and Oppa wouldn't have gone through all this.

152
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:08,226
I really want to die.

153
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:10,239
I understand, Ju Ri.

154
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,850
I won't get angry in the future. Don't cry.

155
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,535
Don't cry, Jo Ri.

156
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:17,249
I'm back.

157
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,880
Where have you been all day that your coming back just now.

158
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:26,110
I started my job as a replacement driver.

159
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,818
What?

160
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:31,535
Until I find a suitable job, I think of this as an experience in life.

161
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:34,762
Aigoo, aigoo.

162
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:36,645
Aigoo.

163
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:38,012
Aiyoo...

164
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,066
My precious child...

165
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:44,656
How did he end up like this?

166
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,688
Since I have committed so many sins,

167
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:53,975
I'm paying for them now.

168
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:59,177
Mom, really, why are you taking it so seriously?

169
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:02,356
I told you I'm just doing it for the experience.

170
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:04,062
I'm really good.

171
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:09,161
Aigoo, how did I raise you?

172
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:13,123
How in world could something like this happen?

173
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:17,263
What am I supposed to do?

174
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:20,950
Why is Mom overly sensitive today?

175
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,356
Ok ok, dry you tears.

176
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:28,704
I bought chicken, so cheer up.

177
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:33,760
Here.

178
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,979
Mom, here.

179
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,856
It's fine.

180
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:39,208
Right now, do you think

181
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,252
I'm in a mood to tear up a chicken leg?

182
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:44,138
Mom, really this

183
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,260
It won't taste good if it gets cold. Hurry!

184
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,374
I bought you the kind that you like, fried.

185
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:51,746
Is it warm?

186
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:53,930
Of course, it's warm.

187
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,635
<br>

188
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,496
Why are you guys being like this in front of food?

189
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:07,967
If someone were to hear you, they would think we were killing a chicken.

190
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,808
Se Yoon...

191
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,736
Open your eyes.

192
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:38,389
Mom is here.

193
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:44,555
Chae Won... Chae Won is here, too.

194
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:49,089
Se Yoon, wake up, please!

195
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:55,365
Doctor, how come he's not waking up?

196
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,865
By any chance, did something go wrong with the surgery?

197
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:02,753
As you heard from Dr. Kim, the surgery was successful.

198
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:05,002
However...

199
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:06,982
What do you mean?

200
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:09,601
Since trauma to the brain was severe,

201
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:14,045
we don't know what will happen after the surgery. We'll have to monitor further.

202
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:18,083
There could be other complications.

203
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:23,505
What do you mean "other complications"? Perhaps, he'll never regain consciousness?

204
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:26,516
Unfortunately, there is a high probability that may happen.

205
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:28,133
<i>That can't happen, Doctor.</i>

206
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,952
Absolutely something like that cannot happen, Doctor!

207
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:34,767
We cannot let that happen, Doctor. Please make our son wake up!

208
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,906
Please!

209
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:51,080
Se Yoon...

210
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,052
Se Yoon, try to open your eyes.

211
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:56,526
Your mom is here, Se Yoon.

212
00:13:56,884 --> 00:14:00,109
Se Yoon, open your eyes...

213
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:05,065
Please...

214
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,356
<i>Se Yoon...</i>

215
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:36,332
Don't worry too much, Choon Hee.

216
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:41,250
Our Se Yoon will wake up soon.

217
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,273
After the anesthesia wears off, and he sleeps the night,

218
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,607
he'll wake up

219
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:51,353
as if nothing happened.

220
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:54,404
I should not have come back.

221
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,115
If it weren't for me,

222
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:02,256
our children wouldn't have such a difficult time.

223
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:05,934
Our Se Yoon wouldn't have to leave for the States.

224
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:10,211
And, he wouldn't have been in the car accident.

225
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:13,275
What are you saying?

226
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:17,292
When you think about it, it's all my fault.

227
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:21,310
Only if I didn't steal our Se Yoon

228
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,731
from the maternity ward that day...

229
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:28,991
My greed and sins

230
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:33,167
have led to today's tragedy.

231
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:36,526
I should have been the one to get punished...

232
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:39,963
Why our Se Yoon...?

233
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:10,079
<i>If you don't want me to go, I won't go.</i>

234
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,265
<i>If you don't want me to go to the U.S. branch, then I won't.</i>

235
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,866
<i>I am sorry.</i>

236
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:18,323
<i>Be healthy,</i>

237
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:21,620
<i>and stay well.</i>

238
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,859
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:39,886
Only if wasn't stubborn to the end,

240
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:43,304
this wouldn't have happened.

241
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:46,378
I am too ashamed to see you.

242
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:49,499
Nothing bad will happen.

243
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,996
After he sleeps well tonight,

244
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:59,230
he will wake up tomorrow morning.

245
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,539
Ok.

246
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:05,238
He should.

247
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:24,268
<i> Seriously, how many first loves do you have, Oppa?</i>

248
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:28,033
<i>Didn't I tell you that all love is first love?</i>

249
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,938
<i>So,</i>

250
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:34,091
<i>to propose to your first love from your 30's,</i>

251
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:36,792
<i>we went to look at the rings,</i>

252
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:42,590
<i>and you sang in front of me to practice. Is that what happened?</i>

253
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,641
<i>Thanks, Kang Sook. You helped a lot.</i>

254
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:49,582
This is so embarrassing. So embarrassing...

255
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:53,830
What kind of embarrassment is this?

256
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:08,198
You wife, what did you do well that you are drinking?

257
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:10,393
Why am I your wife?

258
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:11,860
How am I your wife?

259
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,128
Look at you...

260
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:16,935
How could you yell at me when you are the one who's done wrong?

261
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:19,702
I haven't done anything good, but I haven't don't anything wrong either!

262
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:21,841
You haven't done anything wrong?

263
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:25,941
You fooled around with that gigolo guy behind my back.

264
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,783
And you still haven't done anything wrong?

265
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,778
Tell me honestly.

266
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:37,428
If that gigolo had proposed to you, you would have said ok, right?

267
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:39,965
No, it's not like that.

268
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:41,581
What do you mean, "It's not like that"?

269
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:46,370
You were so into him that Bo Reum, and I were nothing to you.

270
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,276
Look, you can't even answer me.

271
00:18:49,276 --> 00:18:54,652
Even though we have stamped the divorce paper, as a human being, you shouldn't act that way.

272
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:57,591
You have to have a conscience.

273
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,951
Truthfully, we were happy.

274
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:09,700
Because living was hard,

275
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,162
my heart grew cold.

276
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:21,358
Since Oppa said I was pretty, he was attentive,

277
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:26,959
I felt my heart softened.

278
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:34,281
I only got treated as a wife by you.

279
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:38,550
It's been a while since I was treated as a woman. I was happy.

280
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:44,184
I thought if I could only spend one day with someone like him and die, I 'd have no regrets.

281
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,985
It wouldn't be enough if you begged on your hands and knees.

282
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,230
What are you saying right now?

283
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,296
Why should I beg you? I have not done anything wrong to you.

284
00:19:57,085 --> 00:20:00,692
Bo Reum's mom! Kang Sook!

285
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,420
I'm curious about something.

286
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,046
About what?

287
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:18,913
How did you find out about me meeting with Oppa, and started to follow me?

288
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:21,480
Did Aghassi tell you?

289
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,064
No, that's not what happened.

290
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:29,592
The day you got your flower present...

291
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:34,563
You sent the text to me in error that was meant for that gigolo.

292
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:39,987
After that, I became suspicious, and started to follow you.

293
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,646
They say you can only steal if you're used to it.

294
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:48,031
Gong Kang Sook, you're really pathetic.

295
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:54,027
But, why did you act like if you didn't know anything?

296
00:20:56,284 --> 00:21:02,991
Unlike someone else, I don't have anything, and I'm not educated.

297
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:06,504
How could I hold on to you?

298
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:11,916
If you met a nice guy, I should just wish you happiness.

299
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,409
That's what a man should do.

300
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,077
Are you being sincere?

301
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,695
Of course.

302
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,086
You're pretty good.

303
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:24,200
But,

304
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,973
just don't forget one thing.

305
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:39,023
Like I only have one heart, my love is only for you.

306
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:43,151
Bo Reum's dad.

307
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:45,499
Sook, you're...

308
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:51,750
the first and only love of my life.

309
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:56,396
Thanks.

310
00:21:56,396 --> 00:21:59,602
Thanks, Bo Reum's dad.

311
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:02,967
And, I'm sorry.

312
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:08,524
Why are you sorry...?

313
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:14,461
I'm the one who has committed a crime for giving you a difficult life.

314
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,973
No...

315
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:18,304
You're not a criminal.

316
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:21,966
You're a good guy.

317
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:27,903
Kang Sook!

318
00:22:27,903 --> 00:22:31,177
I did wrong.

319
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:34,173
I'll never cheat on you.

320
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,097
Your Lee Se Yoon's guardian, right?

321
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:00,606
Yes, so...

322
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:02,496
This belongs to Lee Se Yoon but

323
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:05,289
I wanted to give it earlier, but I must've forgotten.

324
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,046
<i> Do you like it? </i>

325
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,684
<i> I'm going back to Seoul right now, </i>

326
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:33,730
<i> so, Se Yoon go to your mom. </i>

327
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,185
<i> Chae Won, </i>

328
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,758
<i> Chae Won! </i>

329
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:58,324
I'm sorry, Se Yoon.

330
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:05,171
If I hadn't done that back then,

331
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:08,937
this wouldn't have happened.

332
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:17,373
For the last time, just once more...

333
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:22,268
Give me one more chance.

334
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:24,318
Please...

335
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,055
Why? Are you feeling unwell?

336
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:53,573
I've no appetite.

337
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,439
Even if you don't like it, eat it Mom.

338
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:57,218
If you continue like this, it can be a big problem.

339
00:24:58,162 --> 00:25:02,100
What am I to do when I don't have any appetite.

340
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:06,582
Even when I'm sitting still,

341
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,748
my stomach feels like it's on a roller coaster ride.

342
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:13,301
I feel naseous and

343
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:16,527
everything is about to come up from my stomach and

344
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:20,402
I feel like I'm going to suffer like this and

345
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:23,084
not able to live out my age.

346
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:28,338
Come with me to the hospital Mom.

347
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:31,561
Aigoo, forget it.

348
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:35,366
It's without a doubt the emotional disorder so what the point in going to a hospital?

349
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:39,744
Be it emotional or internal illness, let's have a doctor check you out first.

350
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:42,173
Forget it!

351
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,473
Why waste money?

352
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,574
Mom, seriously!

353
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:50,281
You scared me.

354
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:55,174
Please just listen to me.

355
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:56,316
Yeah, Mom.

356
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:59,028
If you leave illness from emotional stress alone for too long, it can lead to a serious illness.

357
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:00,807
Go and come back safely.

358
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,410
Fine.

359
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,320
I said fine.

360
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,051
Let's go.

361
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:17,032
I'm going to go park the car, so on go in first.

362
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:19,679
Aigoo, alright.

363
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,702
This car is a size of a nostril.

364
00:26:30,446 --> 00:26:33,274
Excuse us, excuse us.

365
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,341
Wait, who is that?

366
00:26:38,383 --> 00:26:39,696
Isn't that Lee Se Yoon.

367
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,549
Wait a moment.

368
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,863
Where did this person get hurt to come here?

369
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:45,148
He was in a car accident.

370
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:46,828
Car accident?

371
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:48,113
Where are you taking him right now?

372
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:51,142
We are in the process of moving him from a critical care unit to general admission.

373
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:54,042
Hey, Lee Se Yoon.

374
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:56,665
Open your eyes. It's me Kim Chul Gyoo.

375
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:59,561
This patient has not gained consciousness?

376
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:00,880
We aren't sure.

377
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,134
We have to take this patient to his room right now so, please move.

378
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:05,961
Oh...ok.

379
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:10,112
He was in a car accident? What is this now?

380
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,029
edema removal from the brain went well and the pressure on the brain decreased so

381
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:18,784
the area operated on has recovered.

382
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:22,103
But, why is he still unconscious.

383
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:25,661
We are utilizing every medical method so

384
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:27,340
Let's wait and see.

385
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,819
Then, you don't know when he will regain consciousness?

386
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:35,054
Yes. To determine whether he would regain consciousness or avoid disability

387
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:37,184
it is a bit premature to decide at this moment.

388
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,514
We should wait and see how it develops.

389
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:41,595
Only,

390
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,919
if the coma state continues for more than 4 months

391
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,329
then the likely of recovery

392
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:49,468
diminishes to less than 15%.

393
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:53,728
So what your saying is, that our Se Yoon..

394
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,480
No, it can't be. Not four months...not even four days!

395
00:27:57,527 --> 00:28:02,237
Please, please save my son.

396
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:06,680
Calm down, that definitely won't happen,

397
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,248
don't worry ahead of time.

398
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:24,815
What are you doing here?

399
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:29,049
Chae Won.

400
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,956
How did you know about this?

401
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:48,167
I came because my mom wasn't feeling well,

402
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:51,555
and by chance ended up seeing him.

403
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:55,906
I overheard it in passing but

404
00:28:56,784 --> 00:29:01,610
it sounds like he hasn't been able to regain consciousness...is that right?

405
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:05,574
Se Yoon,

406
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:07,965
will regain consciousness for certain!

407
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:11,486
Until he regains consciousness,

408
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:13,831
be it a year or 10 years,

409
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,864
until the day I die I will protect him.

410
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,189
Chae Won.

411
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,246
Therefore,

412
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:22,722
There is no way that I am coming back to you.

413
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:26,087
Stop waiting for something that won't happen.

414
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,001
So please,

415
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:33,099
don't persist in staying and lurking around my vicinity.

416
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,444
Please find your own path and go.

417
00:29:39,092 --> 00:29:41,969
This is my last request.

418
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:03,712
Choon Hee.

419
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,005
Se Yoon,

420
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,863
watch over him.

421
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,442
I'm leaving.

422
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:18,408
Unni...

423
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:21,107
Perhaps Se Yoon,

424
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:24,216
wants to be with you too.

425
00:30:24,883 --> 00:30:27,738
The last person he wanted to see,

426
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,754
was you.

427
00:30:32,182 --> 00:30:35,120
All the mother-son affection you couldn't share until now,

428
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:36,844
share it now.

429
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:40,393
Also,

430
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:43,297
if you ever need me.

431
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:46,953
Call me anytime.

432
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:48,807
Ok?

433
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:52,598
You,

434
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:54,921
I'm sure would know how to do it

435
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:57,554
and take care of him.

436
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:01,780
Our Se Yoon,

437
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:04,997
Look after him well.

438
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,124
My son,

439
00:31:40,478 --> 00:31:44,451
You're giving me an extra opportunity to be a mom, right?

440
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:52,510
Because you know that mom is so frustrated and upset

441
00:31:53,065 --> 00:31:56,662
over being separated for 30 years

442
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,534
you wanted to give me a chance to stay without regret

443
00:32:00,548 --> 00:32:04,457
so you're doing this on purpose, my son?

445
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:30,193
Just

446
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:32,182
where did he-

447
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:35,226
Hey!

448
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:41,953
Where did you go, that you are just now coming back from. Leaving your mother all alone like that.

449
00:32:41,953 --> 00:32:45,281
Is that so. I just happened to meet someone that I know.

450
00:32:45,281 --> 00:32:48,073
Hand me the prescription. I'll go fill it for you.

451
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:53,835
What business does that woman have here?

452
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:56,800
Pretend like you don't know.

453
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:59,037
Let go of me.

454
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:03,088
Last time when I went to Chae Won's factory

455
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:05,756
I said some harsh things so

456
00:33:05,756 --> 00:33:08,810
I felt yucky all along.

457
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:11,482
What's wrong with you?

458
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:12,984
Lee Se Yoon.

459
00:33:12,984 --> 00:33:15,526
Has been admitted into this hospital.

460
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,843
Why?

461
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:19,733
He was in a car accident.

462
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:22,628
Car accident?

463
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:25,878
How badly is he hurt? Is it serious?

464
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:28,910
We're back.

465
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:40,202
Did Se Yoon wake up?

466
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:42,309
Not yet.

467
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:45,347
You mean he's still unconscious?

468
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:50,791
Ah, longer it lasts worse it gets. What to do?

469
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:53,634
What about Hyungnim?

470
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:55,379
Didn't you guys go together?

471
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,986
She's with Se Yoon.

472
00:33:57,986 --> 00:34:00,476
We are going to switch later on tonight.

473
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:03,628
Which room in O-Neul (Today) hospital is he in? I should go there.

474
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:06,129
Later, Mother-in-law.

475
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:11,931
She wanted to be alone with Se Yoon,

476
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,089
that's why we came back.

477
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,463
You should go when things calm down a bit.

478
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:19,437
Ok then.

479
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,438
Aigoo.

480
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:24,485
Aigoo.

481
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:28,089
What can we do for my poor puppy?

482
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:39,546
We're going to have a heat stroke, at this rate.

483
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:42,286
Are you okay, Honey?

484
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,341
I'm fine.

485
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:47,191
Don't worry about me,

486
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,099
just go home and rest.

487
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:49,970
Don't suffer with me.

488
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,366
How is this suffering?

489
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:56,567
I heard they dropped an unbelievable amount of flyers but there's not an ant in sight.

490
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,860
Let's just call it a day and retreat?

491
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,327
He's right, honey.

492
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:04,642
Let's just fold and go home.

493
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,298
I can't do that!

494
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:09,840
This is my first Fan Autographing in my life,

495
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:13,595
I can't stop here.

496
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,415
Start the music.

497
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,200
In a moment,

498
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:25,523
Teuroteu genre's Psy,

499
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,394
Teuroteu genre's Gentleman (Psy's follow up hit to GangNam style)

500
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:32,807
Ddool Uh's Gang Jin's autographing will take place.

501
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:35,097
To the first

502
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:37,360
10 fans

503
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,161
we're planning on giving

504
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:43,927
Gang Jin autographed CD "Ddool Uh"

505
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:49,373
run here as quickly as even your eyebrows would blow.

506
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:51,071
This is when you turn on the Ddool Uh!

507
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:52,989
Ah ci (Come on)

508
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:56,779
Who is that there?

509
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,715
Isn't is Kang son-in-law.

510
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:01,155
It looks like it.

511
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,166
It is him.

512
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,602
Sister-in-law is there too.

513
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:08,717
Just what is he doing over there?

514
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:11,462
It looks like he's having a fan signing.

515
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:14,079
Not a single soul is seen, mother-in-law.

516
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,490
♫ <i> Even if living gets to be hard</i>

517
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,177

♫ <i> Because of love.. ♫ </i>

519
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,605
I think we should go and increase the head count, mother-in-law.

520
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:29,542
Lets go home.

521
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:30,312
What?

522
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:31,657
We don't have time.

523
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,791
Quickly.

524
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,270
Bo Reum's Mom.

525
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,270
Bo Reum's Mom are you here?

526
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,387
Yes, Mom?

527
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:42,411
Yes, you

528
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,629
quickly make some noodles.

529
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,944
Why noodles?

530

This is mom's order to provide man power to Gang Jin's Fan autographing event.

538
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,302
Man power support?

539
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:42,604
Mom!

540
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,631
Now, now

541
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,306
We're about to put on an event that will

542
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,733
cool your hot summer with a singer Gang Jin.

543
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,980

This is a 4th generation noodle.

Please taste it.

552
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,898
You can't only eat the noodles,

553
00:38:18,898 --> 00:38:21,374
you must also get an autograph.

554
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:22,105
Yes.

555
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:25,475
Gang Jin? I've never heard of that singer.

556
00:38:25,475 --> 00:38:29,001
Why don't you just sing us a song, live?

557
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:30,790
♫ Ddool Uh, ddool uh, ddool uh ♫

By the way, I don't see that "being"?

569
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:13,608
That being?

570
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:16,580
You know, the In Jeol Mi brushed with sesame oil.

571
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,123
Your first love.

572
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,572
First love?

573
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,356
Tell him to get lost.

574
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:28,972
Thanks Mom.

575
00:39:28,972 --> 00:39:32,402
Roof-top Gigolo can at least

576
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:34,127
belt it out!

577
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:37,256
What do you mean roof-top gigolo? How can you say such things, mom?

578
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:40,181
Aiyoo, manner-less wench.

579
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:42,923
You come after me with fire in your eyes

580
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:46,873
if I say anything half bad about her hubby!

581
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,879
I'm kidding, kidding.

582
00:39:51,879 --> 00:40:05,841
<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Inheritance Team@Viki</i>

<i> It'll be best to stop hoping for something that won't happen. </i>

587
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,477
Yes. Did you call a substitute driver?

588
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:42,956
To the Tae Sang Group headquarter?

589
00:40:42,956 --> 00:40:44,631
Yes, yes. I understand. I'm extremely fast.

590
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:45,699
I'll be there within 10 minutes.

591
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:48,433
Go ahead and count only to ten, okay?

592
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:50,636
Ok.

593
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,767
Did you call a substitute driver?

594
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:03,710
Yes.

595
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,341
I'll drive you safely to your destination.

596
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:20,250
Where would you like to go, Costumer?

597
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:28,821
Han Gang River?

598
00:41:33,448 --> 00:41:35,084
Ok.

599
00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:38,139
I'm going.

600
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,263
Stop peeping and keep your eyes on the road, shall we?

601
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:55,969
Yes, I'm sorry.

602
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:07,338
Seriously!

603
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:11,128
What kind of driving is this? Will you straighten up?

604
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:18,335
That's her voice.

605
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:23,035
I guess at least you didn't forget your ex-wife's voice.

606
00:42:28,888 --> 00:42:30,198
It's been awhile.

607
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:32,294
Driver, Kim.

608
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:35,235
Why are you here?

609
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:37,141
Business.

610
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:38,812
Business?

611
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,747
I'm in an ideation stage of a business.

612
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:42,991
Ah, I see. A business planning...

613
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:46,946
I see. How did you find out that I was a substitute driver?

614
00:42:46,946 --> 00:42:50,875
The fact that Kim Cheol Gyu has become complete popper and driving cars for people

615
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,837
has even reached to Paris.

616
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:53,998
What did you say?

617
00:42:53,998 --> 00:42:55,942
I'm hungry.

618
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:01,109
Let's not go to Han Gang river. Let's go somewhere to eat.

619
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:03,397
Driver, Kim.

620
00:43:05,697 --> 00:43:07,815
Isn't it possible for you to buy a meal

621
00:43:07,815 --> 00:43:10,552
to an ex-wife you haven't seen in a while?

622
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:14,620
Why aren't you driving?

623
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:34,296
Where is this place?

624
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:36,037
This is a train-station cafe.

625
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,624
This is the only place I can afford to buy you a meal in my current position.

626
00:43:39,624 --> 00:43:44,561
Portion's big, taste is good...within the city of Seoul it's renown as the best drivers' cafe.

627
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,102
Okay. I like it.

628
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:49,372
Lend me your hand.

629
00:43:49,372 --> 00:43:51,575
Asking for all kinds pomp and procedures...

630
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,845
Wa-wah-what is this?

631
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:03,344
What?

632
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:05,937
Why is your belly like this? Are you sick?

633
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:08,054
I'm pregnant.

634
00:44:08,054 --> 00:44:09,211
P..pr...

635
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:10,758
...pregnant?

636
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:13,403
Were you remarried in that short time?

637
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:15,490
Where's the baby's father?

638
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:18,967
Why did you hit?

639
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:21,947
Is that something a baby's father should say?

640
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:32,482
baby-daddy?

641
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:34,831
Wh..who? Me?

642
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,780
Wow I'm going to go crazy!

644
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,167
Just once.

645
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:51,652
I got drunk and made one mistake. Not even twice but just once!

646
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:53,012
And you can get pregnant?

647
00:44:53,012 --> 00:44:53,982
I know right?

648
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,542
You have some skills, babe.

649
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:59,858
Really, how can in just one try can you be pregnant?

650
00:44:59,858 --> 00:45:00,921
What kind of...

651
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:03,980
You sure are repeating "just once" a lot.

652
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,441
Do you want me to name the child in our belly "just once"?

653
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:08,908
Can you joke in a time like this?

654
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:12,764
Ms. Na Hong Joo.

655
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:14,456
Look me straight in the eyes and say it.

656
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:16,106
Is this really my baby?

657
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:18,280
Are you absolutely certain?

658
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:23,907
Oh..okay. I'm sorry.

659
00:45:23,907 --> 00:45:26,354
Sorry! Really I'm sorry.

660
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:34,759
I won't say to be responsible for this so

661
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:36,754
don't feel burdened.

662
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,123
Not that it's a burden but

663
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:43,811
it's just so sudden, that's what...

664
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:50,733
I'm...say..ing

665
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:52,791
How are you feeling?

666
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,142
Do you have any morning-sickness or...?

667
00:45:55,915 --> 00:45:58,939
The baby in my tummy is so sweet not at all like us.

668
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:02,720
As you can tell, I don't have morning-sickness and don't have any discomfort.

669
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:05,801
I'm glad.

670
00:46:06,336 --> 00:46:09,637
How is it going with the ex-wife?

671
00:46:12,598 --> 00:46:15,381
I guess...not-so-good?

672
00:46:20,965 --> 00:46:22,385
Excuse me!

673
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:24,855
Can you bring out one more Jab-Chae-bob (chop suey rice), please?

674
00:46:25,978 --> 00:46:27,184
You want to order another Jab-Chae-bab?

675
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:29,308
Are you throwing a banquet? When are you going to eat all this?

676
00:46:29,308 --> 00:46:31,353
Ai..small scale...

677
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:33,830
I'll pay for the meal.

678
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,915
Well..um..I'm not saying that because I have no money to pay for the meal or anything..

679
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,154
It's time for you to get up now.

680
00:46:59,154 --> 00:47:02,404
Wake up and take a walk with mom and

681
00:47:02,404 --> 00:47:06,274
take a trip together. Hm?

682
00:47:16,196 --> 00:47:18,286
You're here.

683
00:47:18,286 --> 00:47:21,256
I'm glad you're here, Chae Won.

684
00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:26,943
Tonight, I'll stay with him.

685
00:47:26,943 --> 00:47:28,681
Mom why don't you go home with dad.

686
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:30,833
No, it's okay.

687
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:33,655
I'm sure you're tired from working all day at the factory..

688
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:36,635
Why don't you let Chae Won take over tonight?

689
00:47:36,635 --> 00:47:41,246
Mother-in-law is waiting at home with bells on.

690
00:47:43,351 --> 00:47:45,236
Yes, mom.

691
00:47:46,683 --> 00:47:51,489
Let me have a date with Se Yoon too, please.

692
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,781
I understand.

693
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,336
Se Yoon,

694
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,076
Mom's going to go now

695
00:48:02,076 --> 00:48:05,027
and come back early tomorrow morning, okay?

696
00:48:07,868 --> 00:48:09,508
Take care of him.

697
00:48:09,508 --> 00:48:10,174
Okay.

698
00:48:10,174 --> 00:48:12,343

00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:28,770
<i>"Recharging complete."<br>♫...if I still can ♫</i>

720
00:49:31,705 --> 00:49:36,020
<i>♫ In your eyes...♫</i>

721
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,801
What's this?

722
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:42,733
Since you've recharged me

723
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:45,291
I feel energized.

724
00:49:54,072 --> 00:49:55,510
What are you talking about?

725
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,849
What do you mean Sun Bae (Se Yoon) is in a coma?

726
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:00,832
Are you serious? I've been saying it the whole time.

727
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:03,334
Why do you ask again?

728
00:50:04,026 --> 00:50:06,613
He was in an accident and received a brain surgery

729
00:50:06,613 --> 00:50:10,499
but he still hasn't gained consciousness for few days.

730
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:14,354
If his condition continues, could he

731
00:50:14,354 --> 00:50:16,175
be in a permanent vegetative state?

732
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:17,874
Why do you say such an unlucky thing?!

733
00:50:17,874 --> 00:50:21,138
Why do you shout so loudly, you scared me to death!

734
00:50:21,138 --> 00:50:24,637
Of course I'm saying it because I'm worried. Worried!

735
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:29,671
If I think about it now

736
00:50:29,671 --> 00:50:34,881
Se Yoon really was a genuine person.

737
00:50:36,397 --> 00:50:38,962
Hey, hey, Joo Ri! Where are you going in the middle of your meal?

738
00:50:38,962 --> 00:50:39,819
I'm done.

739
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,378
I'll be right back!

740
00:50:41,378 --> 00:50:46,454
Aigoo, that girls...just shout aloud and...

741
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:48,875
I'm back.

742
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:50,556
Ai...hey, you worked hard.

743
00:50:50,556 --> 00:50:52,300
Wash your hands before you sit down.

744
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,798
Mom will make you a plate.

745
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:56,187
I don't have any appetite.

746
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,755
Why don't you have any appetite?

747
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:02,633
Why, did something happen?

748
00:51:04,168 --> 00:51:06,336
Is there something going on?

749
00:51:06,705 --> 00:51:09,126
Hong Joo...

750
00:51:09,126 --> 00:51:11,658
came back to Korea, mom.

751
00:51:12,355 --> 00:51:16,699
That being...what's there to gain by coming back?

752
00:51:17,795 --> 00:51:19,241
Hey,

753
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:21,090
do you have her contact information?

754
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,500
I'd like to meet with her.

755
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,177
You mom? Why?

756
00:51:25,177 --> 00:51:29,812
I've been thinking that we've given too much of alimony.

757
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:32,007
Even if it's little, we should get back some of that money

758
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:33,758
and buy a decent apartment...

759
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,635
MOM! <br>Aigoo!

760
00:51:36,087 --> 00:51:40,957
Hey you scared me half to death! Why in the world are you all shouting?

761
00:51:40,957 --> 00:51:43,605
I almost dropped (lost) a baby! ("drop" = colloquialism for losing a baby. typical expression when one is shocked)

762
00:51:44,206 --> 00:51:46,360
Are you pregnant too?

763
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,355
What?

764
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:50,614
You...imbecile.

765
00:51:50,614 --> 00:51:54,062
How in the world this old mom be pregnant?

766
00:51:57,549 --> 00:51:59,467
Cham (Man, I just don't understand...)

767
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,290
You uncaring thing

768
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:20,245
How can you so cruelly cut off communication without even a phone call?

769
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:24,739
Was the attachment you and I formed so shallow?

770
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:26,833
I'm sorry.

771
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:29,767
I thought me disappearing

772
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:33,096
was the best way for the children.

773
00:52:33,096 --> 00:52:34,706
I'm so sorry.

774
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:39,915
Are the kids the only thing that you care about and not the family?

775
00:52:40,387 --> 00:52:42,325
Your father was

776
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,713
until the end

777
00:52:44,713 --> 00:52:47,991
missed you so much.

778
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:49,830
I'm so sorry.

779
00:52:50,764 --> 00:52:55,894
I made such a terrible filial sin, I'm sorry.

780
00:52:55,894 --> 00:52:59,509
I'm sure father-in-law understood all.

781
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,723
Definitely.

782
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:05,185
He was so pleased with the Soo Yi (burlap wrap for burial) you made for him.

783
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:09,145
By the way,

784
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:13,418
Se Yoon should regain consciousness soon. I'm worried.

785
00:53:13,794 --> 00:53:16,336
Don't worry about that.

786
00:53:16,336 --> 00:53:19,965
Your father isn't someone who'd just spectate up in heaven.

787
00:53:19,965 --> 00:53:22,947
He will use what leverage he has over the Great Jade Emperor

788
00:53:22,947 --> 00:53:26,520
to have Se Yoon return to the way he was, so don't you worry a thing.

789
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,427
That's right.

790
00:53:27,427 --> 00:53:29,509
Listening to this, I think mother-in-law is right.

791
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:32,826
Let's just tie down all our worries!

792
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,616
I'm sorry.

793
00:53:35,616 --> 00:53:38,026
I made you worry so much.

794
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,739
And,

795
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:44,016
thank you for welcoming me back.

796
00:53:48,335 --> 00:53:51,060
My mom likes it!

797
00:54:13,847 --> 00:54:15,672
Yes?

798
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:23,345
I came.

799
00:54:25,214 --> 00:54:28,739
I was too worried so I came even though it was shameless.

800
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:30,405
I'm sorry.

801
00:54:30,405 --> 00:54:32,190
No, reason to be sorry.

802
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:35,127
Se Yoon would be happy to see you.

803
00:54:35,127 --> 00:54:41,975
<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Inheritance Team@Viki.</i>

804
00:54:41,975 --> 00:54:43,972
Sun Bae,

805
00:54:43,972 --> 00:54:46,429
why are you lying down like this?

806
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:48,674
Get up please.

807
00:54:50,561 --> 00:54:53,533
I had such a hard time over Eun Seol's car accident,

808
00:54:53,533 --> 00:54:56,252
how can you be down like this too?

809
00:54:57,046 --> 00:55:01,268
I didn't have a chance to apologize to you properly for all the bad things I've done.

810
00:55:01,268 --> 00:55:04,597
What am I supposed to do with you lying unconscious like this, Sun Bae?

811
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,341
Get up, I beg you.

812
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:12,437
Get up and listen to what I have to say, please?

813
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:30,898
I don't know if God would listen to prayer from a bad girl like me but

814
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,200
I'll pray that Se Yoon wakes up soon.

815
00:55:36,093 --> 00:55:38,537
Thank you.

816
00:55:43,701 --> 00:55:46,051
You are having such a hard time...

817
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:48,891
Unni (older sister)

818
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:55,856
I can start to understand how you felt now that I'm in a difficult situation,

819
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:59,622
And sometimes I feel like I'm being punished for all the bad things I've done,

820
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,554
I feel like that.

821
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:07,097
I've been too harsh to you in the past.

822
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,101
I didn't give you proper respect as an older person

823
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:10,716
belittled you,

824
00:56:10,716 --> 00:56:13,302
wrongly frame you,

825
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:18,973
I should have stopped mom when she did these things

826
00:56:18,973 --> 00:56:21,037
instead I did worse than her next to mom

827
00:56:21,037 --> 00:56:23,490
and tormented you..

828
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,026
I was immature.

829
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:34,444
If I came to my senses a little earlier

830
00:56:35,735 --> 00:56:39,609
Unni and I, aside from being sisters-in-law,

831
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:43,543
do you think we could have perhaps have been good friends?

832
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:49,850
I'm off.

833
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:28,045
"Before you come to meet me, won't you go meet the flower first?"

834
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,500
"Then we would never ever fight."

835
00:58:32,539 --> 00:58:34,981
"without talking bad about others"

836
00:58:34,981 --> 00:58:38,382
"through and through talk of lovely things."

837
00:58:53,555 --> 00:58:54,656
What is it again?

838
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,000
"What again?" you say?

839
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,771
You can't say "what again" to the customer.

840
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:02,344
I better call your company and complain that they should train their drivers better.

841
00:59:02,344 --> 00:59:05,302
Why do you keep calling me back and forth?

842
00:59:05,302 --> 00:59:08,919
I have a check-up scheduled for today. I want you to go with me.

843
00:59:11,687 --> 00:59:15,721
Don't you think you should at least do this much as a father of the baby?

844
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:16,979
Well, you're right but

845
00:59:16,979 --> 00:59:19,081
Open the door, driver Kim.

846
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:23,521
I said, open the door!

847
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:26,607
This woman is really...

848
00:59:29,594 --> 00:59:31,483
Wider!

849
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:34,162
Yes, ma'am.

850
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:45,497
I'm going crazy here.

851
00:59:45,497 --> 00:59:48,430
Stuff I saw on TV is happening to me.

852
00:59:49,817 --> 00:59:51,962
As you see,10 fingers,

853
00:59:51,962 --> 00:59:53,366
10 toes .

854
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:57,038
Two ears, mouth and nose, everything is fine.

855
00:59:57,038 --> 00:59:58,551
When we take a detailed sonogram,

856
00:59:58,551 --> 01:00:00,694
babies don't position their bodies favorable so usually

857
01:00:00,694 --> 01:00:02,649
It's so hard for the mother,

858
01:00:02,649 --> 01:00:04,072
but the baby doesn't want the mother to work so hard,

859
01:00:04,072 --> 01:00:06,772
all of it's 10 fingers are spread.

860
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:08,366
I see.

861
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:11,099
Is the baby healthy, Doctor?

862
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:12,137
Yes,

863
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:16,384
kidney, lungs, liver, spine, everything is normal.

864
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:19,360
I think it's moving!

865
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,689
Is it yawning, Dr.?

866
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:22,622
Yes,

867
01:00:22,622 --> 01:00:24,030
it seems so.

868
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,120
Wow! It's so amazing!

869
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,500
Look, look, look, right, honey?

870
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,029
I mean, Hong Joo.

871
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:31,899
Chi (oh, please.)

872
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:35,070
Is there anywhere you feel uncomfortable?

873
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:38,753
Around my lower back there is some.

874
01:00:38,753 --> 01:00:41,887
That's because you gained weight suddenly.

875
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:45,552
It's good for the husband to massage the area before bedtime.

876
01:00:45,552 --> 01:00:49,273
It's good at calming the fetus as well.

877
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:19,977
It's been over a month since he has been moved here, Doc.

878
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:23,254
When will he wake up?

879
01:01:23,254 --> 01:01:27,935
In the case of this patient, the condition isn't simply an unconsciousness or unawareness but

880
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:32,111
it has progressed to a vegetative state.

881
01:01:32,868 --> 01:01:35,120
A vegetative state?

882
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,445
When the condition is prolonged in this state for more than a month,

883
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:42,376
it is accurate to assume he will not regain consciousness.

884
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:44,240
Then,

885
01:01:44,843 --> 01:01:46,660
forever

886
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:49,196
he cannot wake up...

887
01:01:49,196 --> 01:01:51,887
is that what you're saying?
