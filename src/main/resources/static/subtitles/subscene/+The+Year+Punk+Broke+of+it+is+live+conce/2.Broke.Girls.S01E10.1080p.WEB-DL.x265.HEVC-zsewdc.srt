1
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:05,467
Oh, you look pretty sharp tonight, Earl.

2
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:06,712
Going somewhere special?

3
00:00:06,832 --> 00:00:08,777
Max, i am free black and 75.

4
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:10,857
Who knows what the night will bring?

5
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:13,890
Well, here's a twenty.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,896
Can you break this the way you just
broke my heart?

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,132
Pop-pop.

8
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:21,164
Look at all this.

9
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:22,805
People really tipped us well tonight.

10
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:24,196
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

11
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,545
Thanksgiving is almost here,
and as soon as people realize

12
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:27,585
how much money
they have to spend

13
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:29,871
on holiday gifts,
their wallets snap tighter

14
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:34,259
than Kim Kardashian's legs
after the wedding check cleared.

15
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:36,210
I've always loved
this time of year--

16
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:39,981
spiced pumpkin lattes,
bringing my winter furs out,

17
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:41,316
then bringing my winter furs

18
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:43,735
to the dry cleaner's
to get the red peta paint out.

19
00:00:43,737 --> 00:00:47,388
For me, it was jumping
into a pile of leaves

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,326
and finding a used condom.

21
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:54,946
What's up,
children of the corn?

22
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:58,333
I will stay tonight
and decorate diner

23
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:00,785
for American holiday
of Thanksgiving.

24
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:03,872
Wow. I'm surprised you got
the right holiday decorations.

25
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:06,741
Last month, you put out
Easter bunnies for Yom Kippur.

26
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:10,628
So many Jewish holidays,
I cannot Wikipedia them all.

27
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,099
What, like I don't got a life?

28
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,293
My father and I had
a very special

29
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,544
Thanksgiving tradition
every year.

30
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,879
Oh, let me guess.

31
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,465
You'd fly someplace like
the Bahamas, lay by the pool,

32
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,168
and he'd light other people's
stolen money on fire?

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,837
No. We'd rent out
the Waldorf Astoria ballrooms

34
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:38,138
and feed the homeless.

35
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,041
Don't look at me right now.

36
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:43,227
And after, we'd fly down
to our home in St. Barts

37
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,211
for two weeks.

38
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:45,846
Okay, you can look at me again.

39
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:49,183
I stayed
at the Waldorf Astoria once--

40
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:55,272
For that money,
it should eat me first.

41
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:59,693
Okay, ready to go?

42
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,612
Han, if you'd really like
to do something in the diner

43
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:03,330
to honor the spirit
of Thanksgiving,

44
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,915
you can open your doors
and feed the homeless.

45
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,368
Yeah, put your money
where your cornstalk is.

46
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:09,903
Caroline and I
will work for free.

47
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:12,289
Isn't it enough that
when I see them on the street,

48
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,075
I smile and pretend
to fumble for change?

49
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:17,378
No, it isn't.

50
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,746
You can afford to open
the diner for one night.

51
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:22,299
You can't put a price tag on
those kind of emotional rewards.

52
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,419
Yes, I can.
$18 for 16-pound turkey,

53
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:27,271
and I will need many of them.

54
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,106
There--price tag.

55
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:32,476
Here, I will pay for turkeys.

56
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:33,927
Jeez, dude,
where'd you get that?

57
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:35,762
I sell cigarettes
from New Hampshire

58
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,898
to schoolkids in New York.

59
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,284
It is a good profit
and beautiful drive.

60
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,453
I love the leaves.

61
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,238
All right.

62
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,825
I'm feeling y'all.
I'll bring the pie.

63
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:50,077
My mother used to make
the best chocolate pie.

64
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,378
I remember one time
she got so mad

65
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,746
at this white woman
she worked for,

66
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,998
she took this chocolate pie
into the bathroom--

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,734
<i>No, hold up.
That was from the help.</i>

68
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:04,508
I know it's not Burberry
like we're used to,

69
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,844
but I'm telling you,
used moving blankets

70
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,312
are gonna be in this year.

71
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,597
Who's a trendsetter?

72
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,717
We're really lucky
November is so warm.

73
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,153
Another thing I'm giving
thanks for this Thanksgiving--

74
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,654
global warming.

75
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,859
I think the three remaining
polar bears would disagree.

76
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,328
Max, it's time
to teach me how to bake.

77
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,579
Okay, well,
if we're doing that,

78
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,197
first I have to go get baked.

79
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,149
I'm serious.

80
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:30,817
It's the beginning
of the holiday season,

81
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,836
and with all the potential
Christmas cupcakes

82
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,204
and festive gift baskets,

83
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:36,039
you're gonna need
as much help as you can get.

84
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,658
Festive holiday gift baskets?

85
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,626
No way.

86
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:40,878
I'm not into all that crap.

87
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,496
Oh, no. Are you gonna be
one of those,

88
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,548
"I am too cool to believe
in the wonders of Christmas"

89
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,183
type of bitches?

90
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:49,669
I am so many types of bitches,

91
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:50,938
I've lost count.

92
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,058
And the only wonder of Christmas
I'm aware of is...

93
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,194
I wonder how you're gonna
keep up that attitude

94
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,529
through Christmas this year.

95
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,198
Why, because this is my first
holiday without any money?

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,567
Uh, yeah.

97
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:04,735
Money isn't what makes

98
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:07,137
the holidays special, Max.

99
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,872
Uh, yeah.

100
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,191
The holidays
are totally about money.

101
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:12,859
It's about spending money
to buy things

102
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:15,329
to stuff into
the giant black sucking hole

103
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,997
in the center of each of us
that reminds us

104
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:20,167
life is hard and then we die.

105
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:22,753
And that's my Christmas card.

106
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:26,006
Max, I'm aware this holiday
season will be challenging,

107
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,707
will I miss my 20-foot
Christmas tree

108
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,210
decorated by ten gay men? Yes.

109
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,979
Will I miss those ten gay men

110
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,882
outing my cousin Steven
before he was ready? No.

111
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:37,768
My holiday spirit
is bigger than my money.

112
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,152
So come on,
teach me how to bake.

113
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,320
We only have a couple weeks.

114
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,156
Fine. Pour a cup of milk
into the mixer.

115
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,508
This will be fun.

116
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,944
When I was little, I used
to make my father cakes

117
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:48,812
in my easy-bake oven.

118
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:51,915
My easy-bake oven
was repossessed.

119
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:56,253
So, um, speaking of your father,
are you doing okay?

120
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,504
I mean, this is
a hard time of year

121
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,540
for people who have feelings,
and just...

122
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:02,175
With your father in prison,
how are you doing?

123
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,594
I'm doing great.

124
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,679
I actually just found out
that since it's Thanksgiving,

125
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,848
they're allowing me to come
see him for the first time.

126
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,900
Well, that excitement
will probably taper off

127
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:12,302
after the full-body
cavity search.

128
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:13,971
I don't know. I might like it.

129
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:17,274
It's been a while since
I've had any cavities searched.

130
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,760
All right. Pour the milk, slut.

131
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,148
One cup milk.

132
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,199
There, how's that?

133
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,150
Good.

134
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:31,438
Now into the mixer.

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,772
There, how was that?

136
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,575
Uh-uh. We're not playing

137
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:37,878
"Rich girl gets a trophy every
time she does something normal"

138
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,496
Just cover the bowl
with the towel

139
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:41,381
so it doesn't splash out,
and turn it on.

140
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:44,217
Oh, it's not plugged in.

141
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,004
Oh. Right.

142
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:49,940
No, not without the towel!

143
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:56,480
Christmas comes
but once a year,

144
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,433
and I think it just did.

145
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:05,258
Wow. These high-end mixers
are a lot of money.

146
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,010
I thought if we came
to a big department store,

147
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,928
there'd be a lot of them,
and the prices would be better.

148
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,963
We can't afford these.

149
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,798
How much did you
think they'd be?

150
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,182
I don't know.

151
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:15,184
I guess I'm not used
to looking at prices.

152
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:18,571
I usually just point,
pout, and it's purchased.

153
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:21,024
Yeah, I had a version
of that, only it was more like,

154
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:22,692
point, and when
they look the other way,

155
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:25,194
stuff steaks
down your pants and run.

156
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:27,813
Come on, there has to be
a mixer here we can afford.

157
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:30,616
There is.

158
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:32,318
Here.

159
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,338
A $5 spoon?
That's what we can afford?

160
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,708
Yeah, if we put it on layaway,
work hard for a few years.

161
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,593
I'm used to being poor
around your stuff,

162
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:42,929
but not around stuff
that I want.

163
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:45,131
What happened to all your
"money's not important"

164
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,299
holiday spirit now?

165
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:47,967
Max, it feels like you want me

166
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,668
to be depressed
about the holidays.

167
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,854
No, no. I'm just saying
that it's okay for you

168
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:53,272
not to be all up
and everything around me

169
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:54,440
if you're not feeling it.

170
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:56,225
It's all right
to let your dark side out.

171
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,611
Come to the dark side.

172
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:00,363
Oh, my God.

173
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,181
Look, they're hiring elves.

174
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,516
Why would I go to the dark side

175
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:05,651
when I could go to Santaworld?

176
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,204
Let's go get in line.
I've always loved Santaworld.

177
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:10,356
Me too,
as a David Sedaris story,

178
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:11,824
not as an actual
real-life option.

179
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:13,076
Come on.

180
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:15,194
If we get hired, we could use
our employee discount

181
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,714
to get one of the really
good cake mixers.

182
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:19,832
And then it'd be like
it came from Santa!

183
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,701
Come on, Max,
we'd be great elves.

184
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:25,221
I have the holiday spirit.
You're great with kids.

185
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,173
And we're both
so desperate for money,

186
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,708
we'll wear
other people's tights.

187
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,894
Max, I've been coming
to this store at Christmastime

188
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,679
with my father
since I was little.

189
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:36,349
I'd get all dressed up in
my fanciest winter coat and hat

190
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:38,484
and then stand
in line to see Santa

191
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:40,853
with my hands in my muff.

192
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:49,862
And they didn't throw you out?

193
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:52,999
There is nothing Christmas-y
about this hallway.

194
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,201
It looks like the place
Santa sends promiscuous elves

195
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:58,121
to get the results
of their S.T.D. test.

196
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,256
Okay, that's
the kind of comment

197
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:02,208
that almost got us knocked
out of the first round.

198
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,127
You're lucky
I edited your application.

199
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:05,545
Why, what was so bad?

200
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:09,248
You requested to work
in Santa's sex toy shop.

201
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,633
Max, that's not even a thing.

202
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:13,853
Tell that to my
candy-cane-shaped vibrator.

203
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:16,639
Max!

204
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,759
I call it "Santa's big helper."

205
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:23,362
Please try and get
into the holiday spirit.

206
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:24,730
I know. If we get hired,

207
00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:27,450
<i>we'll go right home and watch
Miracle on 34th Sstreet.</i>

208
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:29,569
It'll be a miracle
on 34th Street

209
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,770
if we make it out of the bottom
of this slave ship

210
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,990
without elf scurvy.

211
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:35,658
Hi.

212
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,045
<i>I couldn't help but overhear you
mention Miracle on 34th Street.</i>

213
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:41,214
That's my absolute favorite
Christmas movie.

214
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,465
Mine too!

215
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:44,667
<i>My second favorite
is it's a wonderful life.</i>

216
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:45,918
Mine too!

217
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,954
<i>I've got Schindler's List
on Blu-Ray.</i>

218
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:54,760
- Hi. I'm Mary.
- I'm Caroline.

219
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,145
Hi. I'm Mary.

220
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:58,397
It's cool.
We don't need to talk.

221
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,733
That's Max. She's kind of
a Grinch about Christmas.

222
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,685
Oh, like my brother Patrick--

223
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:05,188
He's always teasing me
about loving Christmas.

224
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,324
He calls me "Mary Christmas."

225
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:10,276
Get it?

226
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:12,912
It's 'cause my name is Mary.

227
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,647
I can't help it.

228
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,616
It's my favorite time of year.

229
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:18,534
- Mine too.
- Yo.

230
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:21,170
Disconnect
before it's too late.

231
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:23,539
Don't be so cynical.

232
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,841
Especially Christmas eve.

233
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:27,159
It's an O'Brien
family tradition.

234
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:28,761
All seven of my sisters
and brothers--

235
00:09:28,763 --> 00:09:31,764
we line up on the staircase
in our brand-new Christmas PJs

236
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:32,932
and have our picture taken.

237
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:36,269
Bitch is 30.

238
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,674
It's my father.

239
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:44,176
Hi, daddy. You'll never guess
where I am right now--

240
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:47,063
applying for a job
at Santaworld.

241
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:49,065
No, it's not depressing at all.

242
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:53,119
The man's in prison, and he
thinks this is depressing.

243
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:56,038
Oh. Are you sure?

244
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,542
It's really not that far.

245
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:02,712
Okay. If that's what you want.

246
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:06,365
Call me on Thanksgiving.
Love you.

247
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,301
He thought about it
and doesn't want me to come.

248
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,553
He said he can't face
having me see him in there.

249
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:13,639
- You okay?
- Fine.

250
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:16,041
Quiet, please, people.
I have an announcement.

251
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:19,595
Everyone in this corridor
has been chosen to be an elf.

252
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:20,930
<i>Mazel.</i>

253
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:23,048
Yay, we're elves.

254
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,818
Report to work at 3:00 A.M.
the morning of Black Friday.

255
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:29,071
Ooh!

256
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:30,856
This is so exciting!

257
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:33,326
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪

258
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:34,660
Okay, well...

259
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:36,779
- I'll see you both then.
- Okay, Mary.

260
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:39,248
Great, 3:00 A.M.--

261
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,336
you, me,
and definitely-a-Virgin-Mary.

262
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,509
Good night. Get home safely.

263
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:54,263
Ooh. Maybe I should not
have said that to homeless.

264
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:55,514
That is it.

265
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:57,633
2:00 A.M.--
Freebie Thanksgiving dinner

266
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:59,101
is now officially over.

267
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:00,602
According to my calculations,

268
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:02,905
we served over
300 turkey dinners

269
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,807
and only had two knife fights.

270
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:06,892
Thank you, Caroline.

271
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:09,278
This experience taught me
that rich or poor,

272
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,815
home or homeless,
we are all the same.

273
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,700
Wait. Where's my wallet?

274
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:17,486
They took my wallet,
those dirty sons of--

275
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:19,955
Oh, here it is.

276
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:22,958
Yes, we are all the same.

277
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,128
Well, I have two things to say.

278
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,547
First of all,
I'm incredibly proud of us

279
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:30,299
for spreading the spirit
of Thanksgiving together.

280
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:33,785
And secondly, someone left
an adult diaper in this booth,

281
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,972
and I am not dealing with that.

282
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:40,292
What's with the sad face?

283
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:41,793
You saw the bathroom?

284
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,296
It's just--even though
we fed the homeless,

285
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:46,131
it doesn't feel like
Thanksgiving without my father.

286
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,317
But you made a lot
of people happy here tonight,

287
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,852
and you should feel
pretty good about that.

288
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:52,604
- Yes, I do.
- Come on, elf.

289
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:53,772
We better clear these tables.

290
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:55,324
We have to be at Santaland
in an hour.

291
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:57,826
Why you have to be there
in the middle of the night?

292
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:00,162
Because it's Black Friday,
and the doors open at 5:00 A.M.

293
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:01,947
Yeah, we want to be there
right on time

294
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:04,583
to see the first person
trampled to death by UGGs.

295
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:06,001
We have to work

296
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:07,920
all night and then
all day tomorrow.

297
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:11,090
- How are we gonna do this?
- I got the answer right here.

298
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:13,158
Max, I'm not doing cocaine.

299
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,129
If we could afford cocaine,
we could afford a mixer.

300
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:21,166
Nine-hour energy shots,
aka elf juice.

301
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:22,851
I've never done these.
Do they work?

302
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,603
Millions of
wired-off-their-asses

303
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:26,355
college students
can't be wrong.

304
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:29,525
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,510
Did you just drink
that whole thing?

306
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:32,611
Yeah, why?

307
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,613
Nothing.

308
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:35,847
I'm sure it's not too much.

309
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:38,450
They suggest sipping it, but...

310
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,535
Who are they?

311
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,036
All right, we'd better go.

312
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:44,123
We got to go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

313
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,359
Oh, you should've sipped it.

314
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:48,710
How do I look?

315
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:52,114
Because I kind of feel like
I look like a North Pole dancer.

316
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:53,882
You actually look cute.
You look good in red...

317
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:55,200
And green--
red and green together.

318
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:57,035
You can pull off anything.
You're so beautiful.

319
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,555
- I don't tell you that enough.
- Whoa!

320
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:01,640
Whoa, slow down, speed racer.

321
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,041
I know. I can't stop talking.

322
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,393
What was in that stuff
you gave me?

323
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:07,479
I don't know.
The ingredients are in Spanish.

324
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:11,383
<i>Well, my corazon
is beating muy rapido.</i>

325
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,718
Okay, and why aren't you
in your elf costume yet?

326
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,437
Because I was talking
to those people over there,

327
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:17,322
and there's a chance--
a slight chance, but a chance--

328
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:19,074
I could get moved to the
strolling Christmas carolers.

329
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:20,993
I overheard their ethnic mix
is short a token blond.

330
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,612
And I'm blond, baby!

331
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:28,233
Forget it. You got me into
the underbelly of the elf beast,

332
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:29,418
and you are not bailing on me.

333
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,703
But those period costumes
are so much prettier.

334
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:32,788
I will knock you from here

335
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,706
to Rudolph's house
if you abandon me.

336
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,408
We are in this together.
Now go get your bells on.

337
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,876
Okay, I didn't want
to tell you this

338
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:39,962
because it's, well, gross,
but the last elf

339
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:41,847
who had the tights they gave me,
well, let's just say

340
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:45,384
her little lady elf friend
visited unexpectedly.

341
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:49,021
Ew.
Talk about a period costume.

342
00:13:49,023 --> 00:13:52,057
You're right. It's disgusting.

343
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:53,392
I can't do this anymore.

344
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:55,477
I'm leaving. I don't want
to do this anymore.

345
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:58,197
I feel tired and wired
at the same time.

346
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:01,533
This was an awful, awful,
awful, awful, awful idea!

347
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:02,701
All right, calm down!

348
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:06,038
Jeez, you're like
a Christmas crack monkey.

349
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,207
Look, we are not going
anywhere, okay?

350
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,742
You got me all elfed up,
and now we need these jobs.

351
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,044
So just go talk to someone

352
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:13,795
and tell them why you need
a new pair of tights.

353
00:14:13,797 --> 00:14:15,797
I can't. It's embarrassing.

354
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,051
Look, either you ask her,
or you rip out the crotch

355
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:22,221
and risk showing six-year-olds
your winter wonderland.

356
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:24,923
Now I'm sad.

357
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:26,458
You, the one
with the dark hair,

358
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,976
- I need you to come with me.
- Where?

359
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:30,179
And is there
a drug test involved?

360
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:33,298
Change of plans.
I need for you to be Mrs. Claus.

361
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,101
The other one had to leave--
blamed menopause.

362
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:37,819
Menopause, please.

363
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:40,689
I had my uterus yanked out
on my lunch hour,

364
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,909
and I was back
at my desk by 2:00.

365
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:46,311
Follow me...

366
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:49,248
Unless, uh, you don't want
that extra $2 an hour.

367
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,700
Oh, no. You are not leaving
me here alone

368
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:53,335
when I'm crashing on elf juice.

369
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:54,953
If I can't be
an old-timey singer,

370
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:56,205
you can't be Mrs. Claus.

371
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,090
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm throwing you

372
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,158
under the sled, sister.

373
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
That extra $2 an hour
will bring us closer

374
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,512
to the really good mixer.

375
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:05,847
And the way my life is going,
this might be my only chance

376
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:08,166
to be married to a rich guy.

377
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:14,273
I'd double-check those tights
if I were you.

378
00:15:19,895 --> 00:15:21,763
Ugh.

379
00:15:21,765 --> 00:15:24,766
These tights suck.

380
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:27,402
Hi. Hi, elf.

381
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,404
I just got assigned to the front
of the line with you.

382
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,639
Oh, crap.

383
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,324
It's me, Mary.

384
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:36,745
"Mary Christmas."
You know, like...

385
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:39,063
- My brother Patrick always says.
- Yeah, you said that.

386
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:41,950
Look at how cute
we look...Jingles!

387
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:44,703
I just named you Jingles.

388
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:46,671
Get it?
'Cause of all your bells.

389
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:48,123
Oh, listen...

390
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:52,043
Ah, this is my number-one
favorite Christmas song.

391
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:53,795
Ooh! What's your favorite
Christmas song?

392
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:57,915
<i>Silent night. Get it?
'Cause I want you to be silent.</i>

393
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,251
What's the matter with you?

394
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:03,921
You're acting like an elfhole.

395
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:07,091
Oh, hello, children!

396
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:09,194
Who's next to see
my husband, Santa?

397
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:11,146
I am so mad at you right now.

398
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:12,947
Oh-ho-ho!

399
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,816
Uh, hold on, children.

400
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:16,934
Mrs. Claus is just
having an issue

401
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,570
with one of her elf employees.

402
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:20,321
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

403
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:21,740
You abandon me on Christmas

404
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:24,626
the day after my father
abandons me on Thanksgiving?

405
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:25,710
You have balls.

406
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,962
Christmas balls...

407
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:30,081
Like on Santa's tree...

408
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,333
Or a Hanukkah bush.

409
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:34,586
Look, I've got
my own problems, okay?

410
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:36,788
Santa is kind of hands-y.

411
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,340
And you leave me here
with this one

412
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:40,842
when I'm coming down
the bad side

413
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:42,460
of nine-hour energy mountain?

414
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,062
I don't know what's
at the bottom, but so far,

415
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,264
not the miracle on 34th Street
I was hoping for.

416
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,483
- Well, elf--
- Her name is Jingles.

417
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:52,237
One more word, Mary, seriously.

418
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:55,457
Listen, Bipolar Express,

419
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,408
you need to jingle
all the way up that mountain,

420
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,578
because all these kids
are looking at us.

421
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,997
Hello!

422
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,784
- You got your list for Santa?
- Yep. Got it right here.

423
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:07,769
Well, he's waiting for you,
so go right ahead in.

424
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:10,672
- Yay, let's go!
- Hi.

425
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:13,091
Oh, you look so pretty
in your hat and your coat.

426
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:14,492
Thank you very much.

427
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:16,761
I used to have
a coat like that.

428
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:21,216
But she gave it to a reindeer
because he was very cold.

429
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,601
Oh, you have your list
for Santa?

430
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:24,686
Let's see what you want.

431
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:27,605
- Ooh, a pretty doll...
- Had it.

432
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:30,341
- An easy-bake oven...
- Had it.

433
00:17:30,343 --> 00:17:32,310
- A Barbie dream house.
- Oh, had that, too.

434
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:35,346
Had all those things,
and now I have nothing--

435
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:38,015
- nothing to stick in my big hole.
- Okay.

436
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:41,402
- Jingles, what are you doing?
- Tell them, Max.

437
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:44,789
No, no. I'm not Max.
I'm Mrs. Claus--

438
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,443
Mrs. Beyonce Claus--

439
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,328
and I'm married to Santa.

440
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,747
No, tell them
what you told me--

441
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:55,967
that it's all just stuff we buy
to stick in our big holes.

442
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:58,303
I've been married for 50 years.

443
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:00,371
I don't even think
about holes anymore.

444
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,541
Why is she talking
to children about holes?

445
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:05,376
- I'll get her.
- Okay.

446
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:07,879
- Caroline--
- No, Max, you were right.

447
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,180
They should know the truth.

448
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:12,100
Mrs. Claus, have a little,
uh, elf control.

449
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:14,519
Jingles, come into
my little house.

450
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,305
No, Max. They should know.

451
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:19,557
There is no
miracle on 34th Street,

452
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,359
and it's not such a
wonderful life.

453
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,944
If it were,
I wouldn't be standing here

454
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:25,413
in crotchless tights
in the middle of Santaland,

455
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:28,032
with a father in prison,
too broke to buy a mixer.

456
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:29,617
Stop it, you're gonna
ruin Christmas.

457
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:31,819
Christmas is all about money.

458
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,872
If you want stuff from Santa,
you got to buy it,

459
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:37,575
because there is no--

460
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:44,632
Merry Christmas!

461
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:48,603
Get her out of here now.

462
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:51,723
And you, put your
knees together!

463
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:56,928
I hope I didn't ruin Christmas

464
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,514
- for all those sweet children.
- No, you didn't.

465
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:02,367
All they saw was
a crotchless elf freaking out.

466
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:06,287
But "Mary Christmas"
will never recover.

467
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,490
They'll find her in her
studio apartment in two weeks

468
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:11,993
hung from the chimney
with care.

469
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:14,212
Well, this is all
kind of your fault.

470
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:15,964
You told me to come
to the dark side.

471
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,999
I just told you to get
in touch with your feelings.

472
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:20,585
I didn't think you'd turn
into Darth Caroline.

473
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,470
Once I went there,
I couldn't get back.

474
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:25,089
Yeah, and chugging
that elf juice didn't help.

475
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,290
It wasn't just the drink.

476
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,426
Before those presents
came crashing down on me,

477
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:29,427
reality did.

478
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,813
I have no money
and a father in prison

479
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:33,848
who didn't even want to see me
on Thanksgiving.

480
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,985
Yeah, well, there are a lot of
people way worse off than you.

481
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:38,302
Yes, your father's in prison,

482
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:41,289
but at least you have one
and you know where he is.

483
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,641
And you have a home and a job.

484
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:47,228
And you have a freaking horse.

485
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,248
So...

486
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,651
Happy holidays.
It is a wonderful life.

487
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:56,671
You're right. I am so lucky.

488
00:19:56,673 --> 00:20:00,208
Well, since right now is the
closest to the Christmas spirit

489
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,626
we're probably gonna get,

490
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:04,295
Santa wanted me to give you
your Christmas present now.

491
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,098
It's our new mixer.

492
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,851
We're gonna old-school it.

493
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:13,221
Aw, you spooned me.

494
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:15,473
I feel bad.
I didn't get you anything.

495
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:18,443
Max, you got me everything.

496
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:21,345
Before you, I was living
on a subway, and now look...

497
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:23,564
I'm living near a subway.

498
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,116
So did you buy this?

499
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,235
No, it's from Santa.

500
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:30,738
Jingles, did you steal this?

501
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,607
Yeah.

502
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,876
I grabbed it
when they were throwing us out.

503
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,377
Wow, Caroline Channing.

504
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:38,529
You keep this up, and you won't
have to ask permission

505
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,748
to visit your father in prison.

506
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,084
But I did give $2
of our cupcake-fund money

507
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:44,869
to the Salvation Army Santa.

508
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:48,222
So God bless us, everyone!
It's a wonderful life!

509
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:51,509
It's times like this
I really miss Darth Caroline.
