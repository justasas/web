She drank Oleg's water bed.

345
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:25,173
It's just a matter
of time.

346
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:26,508
Nice try, Max.

347
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,243
I'm not going
to give her back her job.

348
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:31,046
She should've checked herself
before she wrecked herself.

349
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:33,148
Come on.
Hire her back.

350
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,382
Be the bigger man.

351
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:36,418
And note,
I did not make a short joke,

352
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:37,953
because this
is important,

353
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:39,454
and also because I'm still
working on something

354
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:41,356
with Peter Dinklage's name.

355
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:44,593
No way, Max.
I am holding firm.

356
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:47,462
You know, firm Han
is kinda hot.

357
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:48,530
- He is?
- Yeah.

358
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:49,965
I'm kinda feeling
firm Han.

359
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:52,100
I have no interest
in feeling the firm part,

360
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,436
but I'll hang out
with the rest.

361
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:55,937
You want to hang out
with me?

362
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,539
I'm generally free
mondays through Fridays,

363
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
mornings and evenings,

364
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,643
and my weekends
are wide open.

365
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:03,078
I may have a wedding
to go to in June, but--

366
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:04,613
Breathe.

367
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:05,680
Come over tomorrow.

368
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:06,982
Caroline
will be at Oleg's.

369
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:08,450
We can get stoned
and watch a movie.

370
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,051
The last time
I was stoned

371
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:13,855
was from a contact high
I got at a concert.

372
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:16,925
Well, those wiggle shows
do get crazy.

373
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:23,963
Look at us, Max,

374
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,631
hanging outside of work
at your place

375
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,566
like a couple of homeys.

376
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:30,069
Yeah,
and where is my homey?

377
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,772
Oh, it's this way.
I can smell the axe body spray.

378
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:35,474
Now, what movie
should we watch?

379
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,776
I brought <i>Shrek,</i>
<i>Shrek 2, Shrek 3,</i>

380
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:42,581
<i>Shrek 3-D,</i> and that
Cameron Diaz cancer movie.

381
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:45,551
Is there one
where Shrek has cancer?

382
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,522
Wow.
This is completely--

383
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:53,692
the same place
I always live at.

384
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:55,127
Max, it's so pretty.

385
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,595
I thought your place
would have furniture

386
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:59,698
made out of razor blades
or something.

387
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,068
I wish.
That sounds bitchin'.

388
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:04,470
What are you guys
doing here?

389
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:06,472
What is Caroline
doing here?

390
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:07,940
You said she was going to be
at Oleg's.

391
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:09,341
I <i>am</i> at Oleg's.

392
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:12,044
You guys live with Oleg?

393
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:14,246
You told him
this was our apartment?

394
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,849
As a wise person
once told me, sometimes,

395
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,851
you gotta lie
to keep your family together.

396
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,286
I'm not letting
anyone leave

397
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:21,720
until you talk
to each other.

398
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:25,357
I don't understand.
Are we not smoking weed?

399
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,529
Oh, I already did.

400
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,797
I don't know
what his problem is.

401
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:34,133
He fired me for missing
20 minutes of work.

402
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:37,703
Why doesn't he fire himself
for missing puberty?

403
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:38,871
Let it go, Han.

404
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,341
She spent her morning
dusting a strap-on.

405
00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:43,976
I didn't fire you
because you were late.

406
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:46,212
I fired you because you
crapped all over the diner,

407
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,314
and you forgot that diner
lifted you up

408
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:49,315
when you had nothing.

409
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:50,716
Well, I lifted you up

410
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:53,619
when you couldn't reach
the canned corn.

411
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,789
So, we're even.
Fight over.

412
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,526
What the hell did you do
to my apartment?

413
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:05,030
It looks like you could film
a douche commercial in here.

414
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:09,335
Oleg, this is what
you asked for: Romantic.

415
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:10,502
Romantic?

416
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:12,705
My place went from
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>

417
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:16,575
to fifty shades
of beige.

418
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:19,478
Where's my sex swing?
Where's my sex chair?

419
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,746
Where's my poster
that says,

420
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,682
"Poke her in the front,
lick her in the back"?

421
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:25,117
Oleg, relax.

422
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,353
All your stuff's either
in the basement or the closet.

423
00:17:27,354 --> 00:17:29,221
And I think would know more
about what a woman

424
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,889
would like to come home to
than a man

425
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,626
whose last girlfriend
was made in the Philippines.

426
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:35,194
[Knocks at door]

427
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,462
It's me!

428
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:38,831
Hide your kids!
Hide your wife!

429
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:40,299
Sophie!
She can't know you're here.

430
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,501
Go, go,
all of you.

431
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:44,436
Han!
Get in the closet!

432
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:46,805
Putting a guy who's
in the closet in the closet?

433
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:48,574
That's like gay
nesting dolls.

434
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:52,511
I'm not gay.
I'm a metrosexual.

435
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,549
This is where
the magic happens?

436
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,485
Oh.

437
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:02,288
Oh, no.

438
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,091
Do you live
with your mother?

439
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,793
What?
You don't like?

440
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:10,162
I thought you would enjoy
the girl's touch.

441
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:12,231
[Chuckles]
What girls?

442
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:16,602
The Golden Girls?
[Giggles]

443
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,137
Sophie hates it.

444
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,706
I should've just thrown
a boiled ham on the bed.

445
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:21,940
Oh, no.

446
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,876
My hair's stuck
in Oleg's clothes.

447
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:25,944
Please don't let it be
a pant zipper.

448
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:28,347
Oh.

449
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:32,618
[Screams]

450
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:36,922
Han, Alexis.
Alexis, Han.

451
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:39,024
Ew, take it away
from me.

452
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:43,162
It's so heavy--
Oh, no, oh, no.

453
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,496
Help.
Get her off of me.

454
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,332
Why?
You're finally getting some.

455
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,568
Take it... take it!

456
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,868
I got it, I got it..

457
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:52,868
BOTH: Oh... Oh...
Oh... Whoa....

458
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:59,211
Look! Han's fallen
and he can't get it up!

459
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:03,182
What the hell
is going on here?

460
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,619
I mean, this is freaky
even for me.

461
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,621
Sophie, I can explain.

462
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:12,091
I hired Caroline
to redo my apartment

463
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:14,126
so it wouldn't be
the dirty bachelor pad

464
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,894
you were expecting.

465
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:18,997
But you are the dirty bachelor
that I'm expecting.

466
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,466
And why would you
hire Caroline?

467
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,768
She doesn't know
about sexy stuff.

468
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:23,969
She couldn't even figure out
what we do

469
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,572
with the bowling ball.

470
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:29,108
Sophie, you should've seen
what was in here.

471
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:31,877
I mean, he had this
anatomically correct real doll

472
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,579
he named Alexis.

473
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,183
Yeah, well,
she's very pretty.

474
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:40,886
He had a sex swing.

475
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:44,156
Ooh, a sex swing.

476
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:45,391
What are you
gonna tell me now?

477
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,159
That he had a water bed?

478
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
I did.

479
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:50,062
It had
1,500 tracer bulbs.

480
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,264
It was hot.

481
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:54,133
Well, who has it now?

482
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:57,002
I wanna be with him.

483
00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:59,505
Oh, hell, I'm tired
of all this role-playing,

484
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:00,839
so I'm just going
to say it.

485
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,376
Sophie,
I am in love with you.

486
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:09,615
Oh.

487
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:12,317
Well, I haven't
said this to a man

488
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:15,921
in a very long time,

489
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:20,659
but I like you
a little bit.

490
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,694
I don't know what
she's talking about, Caroline.

491
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,296
I think it's pretty.

492
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,265
You make
everything prettier,

493
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,168
even the dumb diner.

494
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:31,403
Your diner's not dumb.

495
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,638
I miss the diner.

496
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,173
And it misses you.

497
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:36,608
You can have
your job back.

498
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,744
Is it just 'cause I'm stoned,
or did anyone else

499
00:20:38,745 --> 00:20:42,247
feel that deep connection
between them?

500
00:20:42,248 --> 00:20:44,683
Could you all leave?

501
00:20:44,684 --> 00:20:47,686
I wanna be alone
with Oleg...

502
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:51,957
And Alexis.

503
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,960
Now are we going
to smoke weed?

504
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:56,962
Yeah, I'm dying
to see you high.

505
00:20:56,963 --> 00:21:00,066
Well, as high
as you can get.
