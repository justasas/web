00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,685
The guy who let you walk out

355
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:06,353
with a push pop
in your pocket.

356
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:07,888
That wasn't a push pop, Andy.

357
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,773
I was happy to see you.

358
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:12,226
Well, you're gonna be
even happier in a minute.

359
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,694
Yay!

360
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:14,978
But these come with a catch.

361
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,280
Invites for Caroline and you

362
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:17,681
to a party at my candy store.

363
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:19,817
But maybe
don't wear that uniform.

364
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:22,369
People are gonna think
you're a giant sugar daddy.

365
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,159
So, she's still going at it,
huh?

366
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,410
Such a skinny girl.

367
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,646
How much more
can come out of her?

368
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:34,715
Nah, she's just
a little embarrassed.

369
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,583
Something about self-esteem.
I don't know.

370
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,669
She throws it around like
it means something.

371
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,538
Well, I'd love her to come.
No pressure.

372
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,923
But if you can talk her
into it,

373
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,374
there'll be unlimited candy
for you

374
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:45,375
for the rest of your life.

375
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:47,644
[Rings bells]

376
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,429
Look at him, stealing my bit.

377
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,952
The candy man came
with invitations

378
00:14:54,954 --> 00:14:56,520
to a party at his store.

379
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:59,222
What, you think I wasn't
listening at the door?

380
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:00,324
I heard everything.

381
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,409
All the vomit jokes.
I heard them all.

382
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:04,194
[Gasps]

383
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:09,065
Jewelry, already?

384
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:14,872
Your new husband likes
to throw the cash around.

385
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:16,507
He is not my new husband.

386
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,425
And now he never will be.

387
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,410
Ooh, bubble tape.

388
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:23,013
I finally meet
an adorable, sweet guy.

389
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,798
A guy so sweet,
the word "sweet"

390
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,134
is next to his name
on actual real estate.

391
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:30,587
And I completely destroy
any chance I have with him.

392
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,689
You didn't destroy anything.

393
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:34,191
And it's good to let him
know right off the bat

394
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:38,312
that you have a gag reflex.

395
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,435
Oh!
Oh, that's lovely.

396
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:46,787
Happy Valentines' Day.

397
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,206
I am not going to that party.

398
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,541
I can never see him again.

399
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:52,242
Well, do you mind
if I still go?

400
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,777
Being in a candy store
after midnight

401
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,245
is on my bucket list.

402
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,114
Funny, I thought that was
the impossible one.

403
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,784
You should go.
Have fun.

404
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:02,052
I think you're missing out,

405
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:03,470
because you two are perfect
for each other.

406
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:04,721
You're like Hansel and Gretel.

407
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:07,342
They were brother and sister.

408
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:11,345
So?

409
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:21,256
- So, no Caroline, huh?
- Uh, no.

410
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:23,158
- She couldn't make it.
- Hmm.

411
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,626
Well, I'm feeling very sad,

412
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:28,096
but you'll never know it.

413
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:31,183
You're fine.

414
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:33,985
You don't seem to be short
on other female party guests.

415
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,103
Oh, come on. They're fiends.

416
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:36,571
Some of them I know
from the neighborhood.

417
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:37,822
Some I worked
with on Wall Street.

418
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,324
Wall Street?

419
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:40,442
Did you have
a little candy tray

420
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:41,643
you walked around with?

421
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:43,495
I wish.
That would have been awesome.

422
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,146
I was stuck in
an office pushing stock

423
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:46,498
in pharmaceutical companies.

424
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,832
Wait.

425
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,785
You know people
who have access to pills?

426
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:53,021
And just when I thought you
couldn't get any better.

427
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:55,790
Yeah, one day,
I went into the firm,

428
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,292
and there was no firm.

429
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:58,426
Bankrupt. Boom.

430
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:00,178
End of job, no money.
Nothing.

431
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,547
And after I drank nonstop
for a week,

432
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:04,683
I figured,
hey, now I can do

433
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:05,934
what I've always dreamed of.

434
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:08,270
Open a candy store,
be my own boss.

435
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:11,389
So I used all my savings
and opened up this place.

436
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:12,724
And pretty soon,

437
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,276
Candy Andy will rule

438
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:16,678
the world
of sweets and treats.

439
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,979
That sound braggy?

440
00:17:17,981 --> 00:17:19,114
No.

441
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:20,398
All right,
kick everybody out,

442
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,733
and let's go back to my place.

443
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:23,818
Ah... Max, no offense,

444
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,353
but I'm more into your friend.

445
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:27,038
Um, Andy, no offense,

446
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,358
but I'm more into the candy
than the Andy.

447
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,660
I want you to come
to my apartment

448
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:32,627
and say hey to Caroline.

449
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:33,578
I was right.

450
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,247
You two are perfect
for each other.

451
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,498
Yeah?

452
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,882
I mean, it would be nice
to hang with her

453
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:39,701
in pants I don't care about.

454
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:42,220
[Laughs]

455
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:47,726
She's not here.

456
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,877
She must have taken
the horse for a walk.

457
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:51,212
Wait, you have a horse,

458
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:52,480
and I'm just hearing
about this now?

459
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,565
I have a candy store
and it's out of my mouth,

460
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,483
in the first 30 seconds.

461
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,818
Be right back.
I have to pee.

462
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,853
She'll be okay with me
being here, right?

463
00:17:58,855 --> 00:18:00,071
Yeah,
she was just embarrassed.

464
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:02,824
She'll get over it.

465
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:04,593
- [Shrieks]
- [Screams]

466
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:07,445
What are you doing?
Knock first!

467
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:09,681
Why are your legs up
in the air like that?

468
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:10,982
And why were you holding
the shower head

469
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:13,285
down by your--
[Laughs] Oh!

470
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:17,489
I'm sorry.

471
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:19,341
I thought you'd be home
feeling bad for yourself,

472
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:23,979
not feeling your bad self.

473
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,513
What are you doing
home already?

474
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:27,048
Why aren't you
at the Candy Andy party?

475
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,967
Oh, don't look at me
like that.

476
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,218
It's not like
I'm the only person

477
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,437
in the world who masturbates.

478
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,022
[Clears throat]

479
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:36,057
Also, Andy's here.

480
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:41,479
We wanted to surprise you.

481
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,782
But then you surprised us.

482
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:48,787
[Door closes]

483
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:52,106
It's not a big deal.

484
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:54,876
That kind of situation
happens to a lot of people.

485
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:58,880
Who? Who has that
ever happened to?

486
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:02,000
I know this might be
a delicate area right now,

487
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:03,835
but I'm thinking you should
probably pay more

488
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:05,970
than half of our water bill.

489
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,506
Hey, girls.

490
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:10,725
I need some hot tea
to warm me up.

491
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,644
There's no hot water
in our building

492
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:14,462
when I tried to take a shower.

493
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:17,298
That's because
it's all in Caroline.

494
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,683
Max!

495
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:20,769
You are too tense.

496
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:24,356
Here. Take this
and relax a little.

497
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:25,973
Eh?

498
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:29,110
This doing anything for you?

499
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:31,813
[Laughs]

500
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:34,282
Well, I'll be in my booth.

501
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:41,155
Hello, Sophie.

502
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:43,625
What are you doing
in my booth?

503
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:46,261
It's not your booth,
it's my booth. And look.

504
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:47,762
All the other booths are taken.

505
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:49,464
So you'll have to sit
at small table,

506
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:51,716
as is customary
for lone diners.

507
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,225
This is my booth.

508
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:04,562
It's okay, you didn't know.
Okay, bye-bye now.

509
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:07,699
Hello, Max.
Check out my new booth.

510
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:10,702
I think it's better.

511
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:15,657
Oh, no.
I don't want to see him again.

512
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:17,542
Look, he's already seen
you at your worst.

513
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:20,528
You vomited and masturbated.
That's your full range.

514
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,381
Hi.

515
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:26,217
Look, I know you're
really embarrassed about--

516
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:27,469
well, everything.

517
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:29,421
And there's really nothing
I can say

518
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,472
to convince you not to be.

519
00:20:30,474 --> 00:20:32,924
So...

520
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:35,059
[Laughs]

521
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,396
Who's embarrassed now?

522
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:40,682
And to further my embarrassment,

523
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:44,252
I will now do gymnastics
in public.

524
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:52,994
That is not embarrassing.
It was amazing.

525
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:54,061
All right.

526
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,246
Well, then come back
to my house

527
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:58,065
and watch me masturbate.

528
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,405
Or we could just get coffee.

529
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,510
Yay, I'm so happy!

530
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:09,544
Thanks, Max.

531
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:11,212
No, not for you.
