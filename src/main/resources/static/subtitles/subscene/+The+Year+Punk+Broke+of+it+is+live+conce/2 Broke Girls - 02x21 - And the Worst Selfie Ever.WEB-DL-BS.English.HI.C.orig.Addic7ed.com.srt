1
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:06,526
My new sheets
from the "Under A Dollar" store

2
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:08,494
feel so luxurious,

3
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,463
like they could maybe cost
over a dollar,

4
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:12,799
maybe even 2 or 3.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,503
Yup. It was a good day
over at the "Under A Dollar."

6
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:21,741
Steak, bed stuff,
and my new steak eatin' chair.

7
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:24,360
Doesn't it worry you that
you got that meat and furniture

8
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:27,063
for the price
of an Angry Birds update?

9
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:30,199
Yeah, it worries me
that it'll never happen again.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,537
Sheets and steak?
Never dared to dream it.

11
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:36,372
These sheets smell amazing too,

12
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:38,641
thanks to that
one little fabric softener ball,

13
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:40,076
also under a dollar.

14
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:43,479
I dated a guy
with one ball once.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,481
He was all self-conscious,
but I told him,

16
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:48,784
"No big deal.
It's just as ugly as two."

17
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:51,120
I am going to get
such a good night's--

18
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,625
Oh, sheet!

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,100
Are you sure
you want to sit in that?

22
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:06,669
Woman, don't talk to me
while I'm eatin' my steak!

23
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:15,644
"Instructions:
Do not sit."

Ow!

30
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:40,548
What?
A candy trail.

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,801
God, are you just
getting to me now?

32
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:46,137
You do work in mysterious ways.

I'm not God, but I believe

34
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,890
I did answer your roommate's
prayers last night.

35
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:50,891
[Laughs]

36
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:52,159
Andy!

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,862
So how'd this happen?

38
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:57,665
Where'd you guys find
each other again? Rematch.com?

39
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,568
Empty-vajay date?

40
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,503
No, last night, I thought,

41
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,038
"Well, these sheets
are already ruined,

42
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,374
so I might as well
really ruin them with sex,"

43
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,209
so I called Andy.

44
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,579
And I was obviously flattered,
so I came over.

45
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,049
Well, I hope you guys spent
more than $1 for condoms.

46
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,151
- Hey, there are two things
I never skimp on:

47
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:19,320
Condoms and candy.
And Max, did you see

48
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,155
what I left over there
on the kitchen counter for you?

49
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:24,125
Condoms? Candy?
Condoms full of candy?

50
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,094
Well, now, you're
going to be disappointed,

51
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:29,764
because it's just candy.

52
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,632
Ooh, all my favorites!

53
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,502
I wonder if I can get diabetes
before breakfast.

54
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:37,004
Thanks, Andy.

55
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,140
Ha ha! That candy
was just a decoy,

56
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:42,009
so you didn't see my push pop
when I got out of bed.

57
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,848
So... Are you and Andy
back together?

58
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,017
No. It was just
a one-time thing.

59
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:51,586
Look at you.

60
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:54,088
You're like the Greek goddess
of booty calls.

61
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:56,290
Aphro-whitey.

62
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,660
Kind of proud of myself.
My very first booty call.

63
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:01,362
Well, actually,
it was a booty tweet.

64
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:03,631
Booty's up with the times.

65
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:05,533
Technically,
booty call's been around

66
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,169
since the old-timey times.
Alexander Graham Bell's

67
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,739
very first phone call
was "Hey, you up?"

68
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:17,311
Hey, so, um, I gotta go.
Is that cool?

69
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:19,547
Oh, super cool, sure.

70
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:21,983
What do we do, kiss?
High-five?

71
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,951
Max, what do you do
in this situation?

72
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:26,187
I usually wave at him
with my arm clenched,

73
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:28,723
'cause I'm hiding his wallet
in it.

74
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:32,927
Well, nice seeing you.

75
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:37,865
I don't usually do the salute,

76
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,535
but okay,
that can be your thing.

77
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,006
Earl, here's my last check.

78
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,509
Can you tip me out?
I have a possible booty call.

79
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,244
Well, Caroline, you've reached

80
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:53,748
a new place of familiarity
with me.

81
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:57,752
Unfortunately, I've not reached
that same place with you.

82
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:01,822
Can you cover my tables?

83
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:03,558
I've been doing that
since you started working here,

84
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,992
so yes.

85
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:06,394
Good, 'cause I'm gonna
text Andy

86
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,029
for another booty call,
and maybe this time

87
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,097
we can go out
and have a booty breakfast.

88
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:15,336
As the President of the casual
sex society, local chapter,

89
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:17,038
I call bull on your booty.

90
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,839
What?
It's a booty call.

91
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,041
Not with you it isn't.

92
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,609
You think that booty breakfast

93
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,110
will maybe lead
to a booty dinner

94
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:25,012
then maybe booty engaged
and booty married

95
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:27,081
and have a couple booty kids
and a booty retirement home

96
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:28,749
and then booty die together.

97
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,219
That's not true.
He'll die before me,

98
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,288
then I'll take a dance class.

99
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:39,594
What are you doing?
Do you have to pee?

100
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:43,264
No, I feel something...
[Whispering] down there.

101
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:46,968
Yeah, you woke it up.
Now it's hungry.

102
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:56,978
But you don't take it back
to the same restaurant.

103
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,914
What is that and why is it
wearing a bow tie?

104
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:03,551
Maybe because an actual tie
would drag on the ground.

105
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,488
Speaking
of "dragging on the ground,"

106
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,657
maybe you could drag an antelope
back to your cave

107
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:12,126
and have sex with it.

108
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:15,062
See, I have
a sense of humor too.

109
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:18,232
That's one of the attributes
on my online dating profile.

110
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,635
Han, are you all dressed up
because you're expecting a date?

111
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:22,570
Oh, I'm expecting
a lot more than a date.

112
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,739
Our profiles
matched us perfectly.

113
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,307
This might be the one.

114
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,009
Which one? The first one?
The only one?

115
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,678
The one that accidentally
steps on you?

116
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:33,447
She was supposed to be here
a half hour ago.

117
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:35,683
Well, you know,
subways run late,

118
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:39,186
especially if you don't get on them
because you don't really exist

119
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:42,089
and are a money-scamming man
in Nairobi.

120
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,593
Hi, I'm looking for Han Lee,
the owner.

121
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:48,496
There she is.
Pretty, blonde, and clearly not a man.

122
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:50,765
Who's laughing now?

123
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,767
You shouldn't
jump to conclusions.

124
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:54,835
I once had a date
with a blonde woman.

125
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:58,506
Turns out, the curtains
matched the penis on that one.

126
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:04,378
Hello. Are you Ashley?
I'm Han Lee.

127
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,114
Hi. Nice to meet you.

128
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:10,017
I left something in my car
I'll be right back.

129
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:13,654
Is she coming back?

130
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,693
Han, Jesus is coming back
before she is.

131
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,064
Han, you're too good for her.

132
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:24,465
I don't understand.

133
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,468
We were 97% compatible
on the website.

134
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:29,370
Let me see your profile.

135
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,872
- Who's that?
- That's me.

136
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:37,211
No, that's the hot Asian star
from <i>Hawaii Five-0.</i>

137
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:39,213
What?
We kinda look alike.

138
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:41,982
The only thing
you have in common

139
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:47,088
with this guy from <i>Hawaii Five-0</i>
is that you are 5'0".

140
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,159
And Han, "Athletic"?

141
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,861
In school, I ran track.

142
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:58,366
Running under the hurdles
doesn't count as track.

143
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,101
Han, this is totally lame.

144
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:02,002
Let me help you
find the right girl.

145
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:04,505
You give me so much joy
at your expense,

146
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:06,407
I feel like
I need to give back.

147
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:10,277
Thank you, Max, I'm insulted
and honored at the same time.

148
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,914
Seeing Han and Ashley together
for that one second

149
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,083
made me realize I want to be
back in a relationship.

150
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,685
I'm going to text Andy.

151
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:20,788
I knew it. I called that.
I booty called that.

152
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:23,624
Your casual sex card
is being revoked.

153
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,528
Unfortunately, Andy is still
an active member, very active.

154
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,029
What are you talking about?

155
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,199
I'm saying
he has an active member.

156
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,901
He told me he's seeing someone.

157
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,403
He's seeing someone?

158
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:37,772
Actually,
he's seeing a few someones.

159
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,874
How many someones?

160
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,209
Oh, it's back.

161
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,911
Do you think this itch
has anything to do

162
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:45,713
with those many someones?

163
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:47,748
Do you think
he gave me something?

164
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:51,385
Well, if he did,
you just gave it to the counter.

165
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:03,736
What did poor people do
before WebMD?

166
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:06,939
They died.

167
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,741
Ooh! What is that?

168
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:12,078
It's all red and chunky.
I hope that's not what you have.

169
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,913
Max, that's salsa.

170
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:21,987
- But look.
- Oh! What the hell is that?

171
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:25,591
What the hell does Jen
from New Rochelle have?

172
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,959
It's a rash.
Jen says

173
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,128
"It was bad for awhile,
then disappeared."

174
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,665
So Jen came down
with a case of "My father"?

175
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,168
A rash.
That doesn't sound so bad.

176
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,602
I could live with a rash.

177
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:39,539
Except Dr. Web thinks
it might be herpes.

178
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,343
Trust me, I don't have it.
Jen's obviously a whore.

179
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:46,312
Well, does it look like this?

180
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:48,781
I don't know, I can't quite
bend over far enough to see it.

181
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:50,983
Fine.
I'll look at it.

182
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:53,152
What? No!

183
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:56,872
What?
Jen showed me hers.

184
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:59,208
I'm sure mine is just a rash.

185
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:02,945
Cathy from Colorado says,
"I thought it was just a rash,

186
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:07,483
but guess what?
Rashes are always herpes."

187
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:10,086
I can't have herpes.

188
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:13,489
Sex is the only fun thing
poor people can afford.

189
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,293
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

190
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:19,495
Just let me see it.

191
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:22,131
Max, I could not continue
to live here if you ever saw it.

192
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:24,300
Well, then definitely
let me see it.

193
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:29,305
It's okay, I have one too,
except mine has a "Welcome" mat.

194
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:33,509
I know, I'll just
take a picture of it.

195
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,179
And that's how Kim Kardashian
became famous.

196
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,582
It's bad enough I'm taking
a picture of my vagina,

197
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,318
I'm doing it with an iPhone 3.

198
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:48,190
Too dark.
Needs a flash.

199
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:50,693
All right,
but watch out for red-eye.

200
00:09:56,967 --> 00:10:01,170
Ohh... There she is.

201
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,139
Yeah, that's definitely
something.

202
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,009
- Let me see it.
- Wait, it needs a filter.

203
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,779
Lo-Fi, no.
Valencia, no.

204
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,647
Oh, maybe just a border.

205
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:13,382
Just give it to me.

206
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:16,552
Oh ho, that's not good.

207
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:17,853
I just want to go
on the record.

208
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:19,054
It doesn't always
look like that.

209
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:21,290
It's actually quite pretty.

210
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,193
Well, now it has
a good personality.

211
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:25,961
[Knocking at the door]

212
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:28,230
Oh, that's probably
the Center for Disease Control

213
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,299
coming to get me
with their van.

214
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,169
I'll get it.
The walking helps.

215
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,570
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:37,072
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

217
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:42,044
Hi, girls! I got Chinese food.
You want to hang out?

218
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:44,146
Sophie, this isn't a good time.

219
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:49,485
Uhohh, someone's got
the herp walk.

220
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:54,990
Sophie, we don't know what
it is. It could just be a rash.

221
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:57,560
Yeah, it could,
but it probably isn't.

222
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:58,994
- Yeah, let me see.
- Stop it.

223
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:03,065
What? It's okay,
I was a nurse back in Poland.

224
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,768
You've heard
of "Doctors Without Borders"?

225
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,005
Well, we were
"nurses without credentials."

226
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:14,243
Yeah. Our motto was:
"What? We want to help."

227
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:15,711
Quit! Stop it!

228
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:18,180
Max,
don't show Sophie--

229
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:21,283
Oh, my <i>God!</i>

230
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:27,756
Oh, I mean, come on,
slap a filter on this thing.

231
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:31,393
Okay. I'm done. I'm done
with nurses without credentials

232
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:33,229
or doctors without faces.

233
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,030
Tomorrow,
I'm going to a free clinic.

234
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:38,934
Well, is real bad.
You better run, don't herp walk.

235
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:44,940
Whoa, this thing says one
out of six people have herpes!

236
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,645
Uh-ohh.

237
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:52,548
Max, anyone in here
could be the "one in six."

238
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,984
Are you sure you don't want
to get tested while we're here?

239
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:56,552
Nah, I'm bad at tests.

240
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:58,387
Besides,
if you can't afford a doctor,

241
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,723
it's better to just spend
whatever money you got on weed

242
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:03,225
to help you forget
whatever you got.

243
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:04,760
Caroline Channing.

244
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:06,128
That's so embarrassing.

245
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,063
Could she say my name
any louder?

246
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:10,065
[Shouting]
Caroline Channing!

247
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,801
- I guess she could.
- Miss Channing,

248
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:14,837
now, you wrote here
the reason for your visit

249
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:18,774
is an "Uncomfortable sensation
in your nether regions."

250
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,809
Could you be more specific?

251
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,311
Is there a more private area

252
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:24,647
we could discuss
my private area?

253
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:26,515
Oh, I'm sorry!

254
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:28,751
Let me bring out
my hot air balloon

255
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:33,455
and we'll take
a tour of the city...

256
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:37,593
While we discuss your
uncomfortable lady sensation.

257
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,929
Shirley,
the only lady sensation

258
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,097
I'm seeing in this office
is you.

259
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:44,099
Oh, well,
I appreciate that, girl.

260
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,435
I try to lighten the load
with a little humor.

261
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:48,604
Well, I don't need the jokes.
Thank you.

262
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:51,707
Oh, they not for you.
They for us. [Chuckles]

263
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,978
I need to be tested for...
[Whispering] herpes.

264
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:59,848
Girl, you sound like you're
doing a perfume ad for herpes.

265
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:02,184
Just give her the phone.

266
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:05,387
Mm.

267
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:06,855
Well, this is either herpes

268
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:08,958
or something
I ain't never seen before.

269
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,061
Now, the HSV-2
is not a standard pap.

270
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:16,298
It is a specific blood test,
and it is $250.

271
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,634
Well, the only way I know
how to get money for that test

272
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:22,004
in the next hour
will probably give me an STD.

273
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,306
Can we maybe work out
a cheaper price?

274
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,475
We're waitresses nearby
at the Williamsburg diner.

275
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:29,078
I can give you free food
for as long as I work there.

276
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,414
And now that I may have this,
I mean, where else am I going?

277
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:35,351
Blood test or denial?

278
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:37,219
Blood test.

279
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,254
I'll just ask Andy for a loan.

280
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:40,522
But it's actually
more of a buy,

281
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:42,658
since he already
ruined the property.

282
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,227
Classic
"You break it, you buy it."

283
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:47,329
Hey, Max.

284
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,666
Good to see you.

285
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:57,406
I hooked up with that guy once.

286
00:13:57,407 --> 00:14:00,175
Um, do you know
what he was here for

287
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:02,611
and how long he's had it?

288
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:05,215
You know what, give me one
of those sexual history forms.

289
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:09,351
This sexual history list
is hard.

290
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:11,286
Can't it just be a top ten?

291
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:13,422
Well, Andy's not here yet.

292
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:14,857
He's probably busy getting busy

293
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:17,726
with his ragtag team
of gutter skanks.

294
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,595
"Gutter skanks"?
Didn't I see them open

295
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:20,729
for Cannibal Corpse?

296
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,198
Look, you need to relax.

297
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,734
Why don't we just get a drink,
or nine?

298
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:28,137
Two double Jack and Gingers.
Oh, yeah, Jack.

299
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,773
Number 38.

300
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:33,809
Oh, and that Ginger.
Number 39.

301
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,577
Max, look,
Jen from New Rochelle

302
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:37,212
put up a new update on WebMD.

303
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:39,982
She says her life has gotten
so much better

304
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:43,886
after joining a site
called "His-and-Herpes."

305
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:46,488
Hi, Andy.
Have a seat.

306
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:49,224
Remember, you don't know
that he gave it to you,

307
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:51,060
and you don't know
that you have it, so be cool.

308
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:52,928
Don't worry, Max, I got this.

309
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:55,497
And Andy, I got that!

310
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:58,400
Oh!
I thought it was annoying

311
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:00,936
when people took pictures
of their food.

312
00:15:00,937 --> 00:15:03,005
When were you gonna
tell me, Andy?

313
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:04,773
When my vagina
burst into flames

314
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:07,276
and became
an actual burning bush?

315
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:09,845
Wait, that's yours?

316
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:12,081
Worst selfie ever, right?

317
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:15,984
Wow, I didn't recognize it.

318
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:18,487
Was it out in the sun?

319
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:22,257
You owe me $250
for the blood test, Andy.

320
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,093
And $9 for that drink.

321
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:27,029
Look, everybody just calm down.

322
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,932
Andy, you may or may not
have given her herpes.

323
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,000
She may or may not be
overreacting.

324
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:34,603
I may or may not have
slept with that bartender.

325
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:38,273
He is my type, and yet,
he has a job, so he's not,

326
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:41,877
and he goes
in the "Maybes."

327
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:43,779
Look, Caroline,
I'm really sorry,

328
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,280
but I am totally clean.

329
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,649
Since we broke up,
I have only had safe sex

330
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,119
with a special ed teacher
and a dental hygienist.

331
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,055
I mean, that job has "hygiene"
right in the title.

332
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:55,824
Wait, oh,
there were a couple of times

333
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:58,827
where I did have unsafe sex
with myself.

334
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:02,297
But only when I couldn't sleep.
And a lot of other times.

335
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:05,300
I will go get tested tomorrow,
but please, in the meantime,

336
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,069
try not to go
to the worst-case scenario.

337
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,837
I'm not going
to the worst-case scenario,

338
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,839
but if we both have it,
no one else is going to want us,

339
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,841
so we should just get married.

340
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:14,810
"You gave me herpes,
now you have to marry me."

341
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:17,312
You want to save that gold
for our wedding vows?

342
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:20,215
Well, if you don't use it,
I will.

343
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,453
I can't wait till tomorrow
for my test results.

344
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:29,904
I'm going to call the clinic.

345
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,639
You've left, like,
ten messages.

346
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,776
You're acting like the clinic's
crazy ex-girlfriend.

347
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,477
Well, I'm leaving
another message.

348
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:37,812
Hand me my phone.

349
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,153
What? I have to stay healthy
in case you have it.

350
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:48,623
Someone's got to pick up
your welfare checks.

351
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:52,760
Well, this is my life now.
Working at a diner with herpes.

352
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,329
The very best
I can ever hope to be

353
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,398
is a mentor
for a younger girl with herpes.

354
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:01,769
Hi.
Maybe you can help me.

355
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,473
Well, with that smile and
my bad heart, I'll die trying.

356
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,141
[Laughs]

357
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,043
I'm looking
for the overly-emotional girl

358
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,712
that works here as a waitress.

359
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,948
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

360
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,985
Am I dying?
Are you the angel of death?

361
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:19,554
I think I found her.

362
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,456
Can we have a seat
for a minute?

363
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,524
Max, Max,
she wants to sit down.

364
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,326
Come here and hold my hand.

365
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:30,164
Oh, I'll hold your hand
after I find out what you have.

366
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:31,866
No need to be all dramatic.

367
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,702
I just came to tell you
that your blood test came back,

368
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:39,641
but I am not allowed to give you
the results without a doctor.

369
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,875
You're not?

370
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,310
No, I am not.

371
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,314
That's a neg-a-tive,
a neg-a-tive.

372
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,850
Wait. Are you saying
it's negative?

373
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,919
I could not tell you that.

374
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,822
I also could not tell you
that it was probably

375
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,892
an allergic reaction to soap
or laundry detergent.

376
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:01,029
Oh, my God! Max, it was
that fabric softener ball

377
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,431
from the "Under A Dollar" store.
Oh!

378
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:07,835
I'm not a cheap whore.
I'm just poor.

379
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,005
Shirley, it was really cool
of you to come all the way in,

380
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,174
because we were really
very upset,

381
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,244
so upset that a caring
medical professional like you

382
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:17,912
would probably help us out

383
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:21,716
with something
for our anxiety or parties.

384
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:24,085
Nice try.

385
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,854
But I'm not here just
out of the goodness of my heart.

386
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,224
I'm here for my free fries.
I'm starving.

387
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:31,793
I haven't been able to eat
since you showed me

388
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:33,798
that phone picture
of your bits and pieces.

389
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,767
- Fries coming right up.
- And thank you so much.

390
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:42,036
Oh, it's nice
to give out good news.

391
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,939
What about you? When can I
give you some good news?

392
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,474
I'll be in tomorrow,
I'm just waiting

393
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:49,544
for a call back
from John Mayer.

394
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:54,215
Hi, I'm looking for Han Lee.

395
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,284
Oh, that's the girl
I set up Han with.

396
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:00,621
No visible Adam's apple.
Go for it.

397
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:03,958
Oh, Max, she's very pretty.
Are you sure she'll go for me?

398
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,160
I think she might.
Let's go say hi.

399
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:09,097
Hi, you must be Jen.
Jen, this is Han.

400
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,799
Han, this is Jen
from New Rochelle.

401
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,401
- Hi.
- Hello.

402
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,104
Jen from New Rochelle?
Max, no!

403
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:17,472
What?
It could just be

404
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:21,342
a reaction
to her laundry detergent.

405
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:28,516
I'm clean!
Totally clean!

406
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,588
Shirley was as surprised
as I am.

407
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,957
Oh, Max, I'm so happy for you.

408
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,493
Yep, I dodged a bullet,
but from now on,

409
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:39,994
I'm going to be
a little more discerning.

410
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,163
I'm not 13 anymore.

411
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:45,433
So I just texted Andy and
told him it was a false alarm.

412
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,201
- I didn't have it.
- What did he say?

413
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,604
He said,
"Hey, you up?"

414
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,806
But I'm definitely not
gonna go.

415
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:53,341
Am I?

416
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:54,776
All right, here's the thing.

417
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,944
This is about something bigger
than Andy.

418
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,479
Actually,
Andy's quite--

419
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,381
Oh, I know.

420
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,049
Came out to get
a drink of water.

421
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,452
Saw it, loved it.

422
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,355
Look, I'm going to
keep this simple.

423
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:11,392
You are using Andy
to fill a hole.

424
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,964
Yes, Max, that's how sex works.

425
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,133
Ever since the business closed,

426
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,735
you've got all this free time,

427
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,570
and you don't know
what to do with yourself.

428
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:26,641
I hear you. You're right,
ever since the business closed,

429
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,342
I do have a huge hole.

430
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,645
I know. Came out
to get a drink of water.

431
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,047
Saw it, loved it.

432
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:34,916
Max, I know we said
we were gonna

433
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,752
do the cupcake business again,
but now we have to make it real.

434
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,420
I mean, I'm a businesswoman.

435
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,055
I need to have a business,
or apparently, I'm gonna

436
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:43,224
put someone else's business
into my business.

437
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:44,425
[Knocking at the door]

438
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:45,927
So Max, tomorrow,
we start again,

439
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:47,929
and this time,
we have to give it our all.

440
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,099
Clear vaginas, full hearts,
can't lose.

441
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,836
Hey, girls.

442
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,270
I came down with a solution

443
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:59,006
to your herpes problem,
Caroline.

444
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,709
Just don't tell anyone!

445
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,611
Sophie, I don't have it.

446
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:05,880
That's it!
That's the way to do it!

447
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:08,983
Problem solved.
All right, bye-bye.
