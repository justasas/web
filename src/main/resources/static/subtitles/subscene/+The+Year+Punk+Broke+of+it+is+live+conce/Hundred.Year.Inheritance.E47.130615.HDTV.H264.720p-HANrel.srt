<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,866
<i>Episode 47</i>

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,792
Se Yoon!

4
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:20,450
Mom left home.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,528
What did you say?

6
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:25,279
She turned off her phone so there is no way of reaching her.

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,309
I was wondering if she had contacted you.

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,749
If she does call me, I'll have my secretary call you.

9
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:37,726
What?

10
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:42,935
Besides meeting for work, I hope we don't meet for personal reasons.

11
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:49,273
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:54,819
I knew you would get hurt, but...

13
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:57,516
I had no other choice.

14
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:02,005
After knowing very well that Mother went to the emergency room in an ambulance,

15
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:06,293
I couldn't insist on our marriage.

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,089
Though, it's not that I don't understand your feelings.

17
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:15,219
I'm too tired to go on now.

18
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:22,191
I was sure that I'd stay by your side

19
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:27,226
for a long time until the end.

20
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:33,708
I guess I overestimated myself.

21
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,274
If mom calls me, I'll contact you.

22
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:31,624
<i>The customer's phone is powered off... <br>Please leave a message...</i>

23
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:48,972
Do you think our company is your playground?

24
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:51,645
Didn't you just submit your resignation and run away?

25
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:55,303
Now you have decided to come back to work on your own?

26
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,831
I clearly told you,

27
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:01,858
That if you marry Chae Won our relationship would end along

28
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:02,813
with your position in the company...

29
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:07,397
I didn't get married.

30
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,952
Mom went to the ER in an ambulance yesterday.

31
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:13,515
The emergency room? Why?

32
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:16,365
They said she overdosed on the anti-anxiety medication.

33
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:18,067
Keeping it secret from the family,

34
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,174
she has been getting psychiatric treatments all this time.

35
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:21,584
What?

36
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:26,762
If I decide to go to the branch in the U.S., will you reconcile with Mom?

37
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:33,292
If you promise me that you will, I can leave as soon as next week.

38
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:47,522
She is cold and cruel.

39
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:50,380
Without saying a word, how could she

40
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,386
just toss us the divorce paper and leave home?

41
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:58,675
We never even had an argument.

42
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:07,424
Did she really not say anything about it to you?

43
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:10,539
She didn't.

44
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:17,331
It's not like she has any family. And since she lived abroad for so long, she doesn't have friends in Korea.

45
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,600
Just where could she have gone?

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,236
She wouldn't go back to america, would she?

47
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:26,709
Then there is really no way of finding her.

48
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:50,441
<i>I'm really disappointed.</i>

49
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,672
<i>What are you disappointed about...?</i>

50
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:56,023
<i> If you really thought of Chae Won as your daughter,</i>

51
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:57,873
<i>then, you wouldn't be like this.</i>

52
00:04:57,873 --> 00:05:01,621
<i> Even if Se Yoon is your Son, Chae Won is your daughter.</i>

53
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,824
<i>As if nothing is wrong,</i>

54
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:06,536
<i>how could you say, "Let's let them get married."?</i>

55
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:08,856
<i> How can you say that?</i>

56
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:13,634
<i> Until now I have thought of Chae Won as my daughter.</i>

57
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:19,749
I was wrong Choon Hee.

58
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:23,022
I shouldn't have said those words to you.

59
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:28,753
Since I apologized please come back.

60
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,153
<i> Choon Hee.</i>

61
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:46,990
Where are you right now?

62
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,788
You must have been very suprised...

63
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:51,534
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:54,479
Where are you right now? I'll pick you up right away...

65
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,576
Just tell me where you are.

66
00:05:56,576 --> 00:06:01,681
If I didn't end it now, there would have been no way to end it later.

67
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:04,470
This could all end by sacrificing only myself.

68
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,994
Please honor my wish.

69
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:10,446
Then what about me?

70
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,815
<i>If you leave like this,</i>

71
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:16,263
<i>haven't you thought about how I... would be?</i>

72
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:20,646
Do you not care whether I live or die?

73
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,707
I know that you're having a hard time,

74
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:27,907
For our children's future, we have no choice.

75
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:30,225
We have to make the sacrifice.

76
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:33,880
I can't do that. I won't do that.

77
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,714
I can't live away from you one minute or one second!

78
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:45,357
If I'm not there, then Se Yoon and Chae Won can get married.

79
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:46,995
There won't be any problems.

80
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:51,998
Seriously, how are you understanding what I said?

81
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:58,341
Do you only care about the kids,

82
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:00,804
am I nothing to you?

83
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:04,798
If you leave like this...

84
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,155
I...

85
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,602
I...

86
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:15,147
Do you think I can live without going crazy?

87
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:16,412
Honey.

88
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,013
<i>Don't torment me anymore.</i>

89
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:24,413
Tell me where you are. First lets just meet and talk.

90
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,476
If you leave me like this,

91
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:35,098
the only choice I have is to bite down on my tongue and kill myself.

92
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,473
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:40,703
How can you do this to me?

94
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:47,489
How can you hurt me like this?

95
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:48,934
I'm sorry Honey.

96
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:53,184
If you know you're sorry, then stop doing things that will make you say that.

97
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:57,272
Hurry up and come home, immediately.

98
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:01,940
Even though it wasn't that long...

99
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,884
Meeting you made me quite happy.

100
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:12,854
I spent all my life being lonely as an orphan.<br>With Father and Mother,

101
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:17,268
I was fortunate to live in an extended family.

102
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:22,763
and I got to have a pretty daughter like Chae Won.

103
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:27,645
Having met you,

104
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:31,271
I got to live like a person.

105
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:33,103
Honey.

106
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:36,413
Even at our age, parting is so difficult.

107
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:41,529
I cannot let our children suffer like this.

108
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,973
Let's just end it here, please?

109
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:53,238
I'll give you a call when you're over me.

110
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:55,963
Don't hang up Honey.

111
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:59,552
Honey? Honey?

112
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,377
<i>The customer's phone is powered off...</i>

113
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:52,983
Geum Yoon Food has been focused on contributing in dietary life of people

114
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:57,543
with foods that are mass-marketed but nutritious.

115
00:09:57,543 --> 00:10:00,239
However, recently,

116
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:03,050
due to management's lack of knowledge

117
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:07,035
and sub-standard food production

118
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:12,295
we were not able to meet the customers' expectation for which we deeply apologize.

119
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:14,289
Yes

120
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:16,124
In order to change the image to

121
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:19,374
forward thinking Geum Ryong Food,

122
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,254
from CEO and president to

123
00:10:22,743 --> 00:10:25,089
entire executive board members

124
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,356
will be resigning.

125
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:42,562
You've worked very hard mom.

126
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:46,096
Here, it's Cheongsimhwan (pill for calming one's nerves).

127
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:48,355
Please take this and chew carefully.

128
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:58,925
The company I gave my entire life to establish

129
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,242
is now in the hands of undeserving wretches! What...

130
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,547
I'm sorry Mother.

131
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:08,677
It's because of me..

132
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:12,111
I should have came to my senses a long time ago.

133
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:14,061
This is all my fault.

134
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:19,544
You often called me awful and ignorant,

135
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:24,552
we live in a world where if you close your eyes they'd steal your nose off your face.

136
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,750
Look at this.

137
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:30,482
I sweated blood all my life to build my company.

138
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:35,169
With eyes wide open, it was taken away.

139
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:38,724
The world is a very scary place.

140
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:43,716
Because I was brought up like a hot-house plant, I didn't know the way of the world very well.

141
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:47,890
Going through this ordeal, I have realized a lot of things.

142
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,629
You've realized more things?

143
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,322
How come you have so many things to realize about? Huh? Why didn't you realize a little earlier?

144
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:58,645
What's it about, after the soup has been spilled and the bowl has been broken, huh?

145
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,695
Aigoo.

146
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:04,163
Why can't I see even a nose booger of Lawyer Hong's?

147
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:07,676
Fetch Lawyer Hong.

148
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:08,783
Yes, President.

149
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,141
But, Mom, what's going to happen to us now?

150
00:12:20,003 --> 00:12:23,071
We have to sail with the wind direction, and

151
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:27,857
we have to follow where the water spills.

152
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:34,697
President?

153
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:35,595
What?

154
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:39,464
His phone number must have changed, It says that number is unreachable.

155
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:44,161
His number changed... What are you saying?! Did you push the numbers correctly?

156
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:48,815
Last night I...I.. I called him last night. What are you talking about.

157
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:56,092
<i>The number you've dialed is not in service. Please try...</i>

158
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,611
What happened?

159
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:05,877
What is it Mother?

160
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,868
I have a weird feeling.

161
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:11,767
Weird feeling?

162
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,672
Wait mom.

163
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,548
What?

164
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,285
What is going on?

165
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:22,035
Mother!

166
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,160
Why?

167
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,717
Why won't this open?

168
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,684
It must be his day off, Mom.

169
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:38,667
No, but, It's not even the weekend, why would the doors be closed?

170
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,981
Excuse me.

171
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,592
We came to find out something. But here, the lawyer's door is locked?

172
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,819
The sign is still left there.

173
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,439
This office shut down.

174
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:54,152
Aye,

175
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:57,135
why did an upstanding business close?

176
00:13:57,135 --> 00:14:00,947
The Lawyer said he had to move overseas urgently

177
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:03,613
they were going to close up the office, I heard.

178
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:07,063
He went overseas?

179
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,200
Mother, Mother.

180
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,347
Be careful.

181
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:15,936
No. No. When did the doors close?

182
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:18,176
It's been 3 or 4 days.

183
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,917
This rotten

184
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,273
we even spoke yesterday but he didn't say a word about this.

185
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:29,792
How much did you give Lawyer Hong?

186
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:34,377
I said, HOW MUCH DID YOU GIVE HIM?

187
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,469
All of it?

188
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:40,767
All of it, I gave all of it.

189
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:46,413
Real estate and savings and etc., all of it...all of it...I put all of it under his care.

190
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:50,531
Oh my god, even Chae Neung (?) account is also under Hong attorney's...

191
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,848
Aye, no way, no way.

192
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:57,933
There is no way this is happening. This isn't possible. He wouldn't betray me

193
00:14:57,933 --> 00:15:00,916
How could he betray me?

194
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:05,443
That rascal. Mom we have to report this to police.

195
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:08,697
What will we do?

196
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:09,725
Aigoo.

197
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,383
What are we supposed to do?

198
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:13,005
My blood money.

199
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:17,821
Aye, my blood money, taken right in front of healthy eyes.

200
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:18,480
What to do?

201
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,421
Mom, Mom! Are you okay? Come to your senses!

202
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,315
Mom!

203
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:21,695
Ow.

204
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:22,530
Mom!

205
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,224
This won't do. Mom, get on my back.

206
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,921
Mom, Mom.

207
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,092
Common let's go up.

208
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,369
What is it?

209
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,382
I was worried about how you were doing.

210
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,149
Are you feeling better?

211
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,039
Bringing me to the hospital,

212
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,882
I understand you had a hard time.

213
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:57,021
Thank you.

214
00:15:57,021 --> 00:16:00,442
Up to that, is that hard for a friend?

215
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,841
I brought porridge.

216
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,940
Take a bite.

217
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,229
let's go sit on the bed.

218
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:10,164
Since I hurt inside, I still can't eat.

219
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:14,980
I'm sorry, Sul Joo.

220
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,726
Truthfully,

221
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,445
I was very

222
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:23,166
jealous of you.

223
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,699
Not only you have a capable husband, you have a great son as well.

224
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,838
You didn't have one thing missing or lacked anything.

225
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:32,930
Watching your perfect life,

226
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:35,149
I...

227
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:38,485
I envied you to death.

228
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:40,683
And,

229
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:45,245
since your husband is the owner of the company our Seul Hong's daddy worked for,

230
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,033
I wanted to appease you

231
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:52,063
and always felt timid

232
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:54,777
so I kept trying to read your intent and please you.

233
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:56,228
I'm sorry

234
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:57,313
No,

235
00:16:57,313 --> 00:17:00,668
No. I'm not saying this to get an apology from you.

236
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,066
I'm confessing to you right now, Seol Joo.

237
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:10,383
I had such an inferiority complex towards you

238
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:13,296
I thought a lot of bad things.

239
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,598
When I found out that you were not Se Yoon's biological mother,

240
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:20,692
I sang a celebratory song in my head.

241
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:24,290
Finally, that haughty and overproud Baek Sul Joo

242
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,988
would be taken down without mercy.

243
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,478
I'm bad right?

244
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,948
You have the right.

245
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,783
I've been pretty fussy and

246
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:40,206
over sensitive.

247
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:43,350
While driving over to the emergency room in the ambulance,

248
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,175
I thought about it.

249
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,764
When you're better,

250
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,700
I must ask for forgiveness.

251
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:56,179
What forgiveness...non sense.

252
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:04,338
Thank you, Do Hee.

253
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:19,961
aigoo... stop crying.

254
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:23,563
You're going to ruin your beautiful face.

255
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:26,939
So,

256
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,730
How is Choon Hee faring?

257
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:34,649
Oh, Chae Won's mother

258
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:38,034
left home this morning.

259
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,082
She...left...

260
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:42,064
home? What does that...

261
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:45,019
What are you saying?

262
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:08,072
Welcome...

263
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:10,746
Who is this?

264
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:13,320
I've come, Unni

265
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,210
One and only Choon Hee

266
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,400
Oh my world!

267
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,844
Have you been well?

268
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:25,776
Without any warning, what brings you here huh?

269
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:30,173
I came to be a burden to you, Unni.

270
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:40,134
<i>Please promise me,</i>

271
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,845
<i>This shroud..</i>

272
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:47,298
<i>You have to wear it 20 years after, okay</i>

273
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:50,958
<i>Father, promise me.</i>

274
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,338
<i>I promise.</i>

275
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:08,465
You leaving like this. Is that why you brought me this present?

276
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:11,073
Se Yoon's mom.

277
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:13,612
I will be leaving on a long journey.

278
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,730
You should see me off.

279
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:22,659
This is so frustrating.

280
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:28,157
Why did these good teeth get so sensitive?

281
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:44,022
Why...what's wrong?

282
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:48,363
I'm sick and tired.

283
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,804
Because of Chae Won's mom,

284
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:54,997
These teeth are causing suffering, suffering.

285
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,147
Are you have a toothache?

286
00:20:56,147 --> 00:21:00,507
Last night's dream was a bit on the wild side...ow ow.

287
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:07,177
Say "ah".

288
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:10,876
What would you know.

289
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:13,678
I said say "ah".

290
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:20,495
Wow, your molar is black and rotten.

291
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:24,134
You just left it until it became like this?

292
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:27,028
You should have gotten treatment at the dentists.

293
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:30,624
I went a while ago, and the doctor said

294
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,186
I needed have a new tooth put in.

295
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:36,570
It sounded like it would cost a lot of money.

296
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,446
Stand up.

297
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:41,852
Let's go to the dentist together.

298
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:44,561
To fix my teeth?

299
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,581
It will cost a lot.

300
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:50,901
Come on, get up.

301
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:59,033
What's going on?

302
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:04,416
That miser old man is giving a large amount of money without a complaint.

303
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,588
Since you came,

304
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:12,121
ask the dentist to fix whatever needs fixing too.

305
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,985
I'm fine.

306
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,010
Fine, really?

307
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,225
Because of your teeth you can't even drink cold water.

308
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:24,061
I'm fine, so just worry about yourself.

309
00:22:25,772 --> 00:22:27,162
Ms. Kim Kkeut Soon.

310
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:28,121
Right here.

311
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:30,032
Please come with me.

312
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:36,586
I'm scared. I have a bad feeling.

313
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,500
Are you a kid, to be afraid?

314
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,570
Go in there with me and hold my hand.

315
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:48,363
Aigoo, that exaggeration...

316
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:57,105
The relationship between you two must be very good. It's really nice to see, Elder.

317
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:59,229
She has many worries,

318
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,515
so please go easy on her so that it doesn't hurt.

319
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,644
Yes, Elder.

320
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:06,945
Grandmother, please say "ah".

321
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:10,294
-Ah. <br>-Yes, that is very nice.

322
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:23,665
What brings you here?

323
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,643
Aye, yes, we're interior remodelers.

324
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:29,435
The madam who'd be moving into this house next month has asked us to renovate.

325
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:31,510
Re..no...va...

326
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,916
Renovation?

327
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,802
Ah, yes.

328
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:40,388
You have to move out by the beginning of next week so that we can start the construction.

329
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:42,826
You sold the house too??

330
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:47,661
And that money too, [went to] Lawyer Hong?

331
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:49,724
Uhh, uhh. (yes)

332
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:55,351
Aiyoo, I was going to go house-hunting when the company problem ended.

333
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:59,571
What are we going to do?

334
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:11,495
Cheer up, you'd be great.

335
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:16,363
All you have to do is just answer only the question being asked.

336
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:17,358
No need to be nervous.

337
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:19,659
I know. There's no problem.

338
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:22,937
When you were in concert, you performed in bigger venues, honey.

339
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:26,146
I said I'm not shaking so it doesn't matter.

340
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:27,596
Kang Jin, get ready.

341
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,384
Yes.

342
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,360
Honey, fighting!

343
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,946
Ba-sha (fighting!)!

344
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:39,771
Today after 10 years, we're here with trot singer, Kang Jin.

345
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,433
Yes.

346
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:43,103
Please greet the fans.

347
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:46,293
Hello

348
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:50,537
I am a comeback kid with a new song, Gang Joon.

349
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:52,556
Yes, nice to meet you.

350
00:24:52,556 --> 00:24:56,396
The album is coming out after 10 years,

351
00:24:56,396 --> 00:25:02,093
and I'm wondering if there is a specific reason for that.

352
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:08,219
Yes, after a long time waiting for this album overcome with emotions,

353
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:11,680
he can't speak. Is what I'm saying correct, Kang Joon?

354
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:19,620
Ah, well, yes, because of radio format

355
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,041
I'm sure all the viewers would know but

356
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:28,246
I believe Mr. Gang Joon is reminded of the hardship experience while he was an unknown.

357
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:31,167
It must have been very hard.

358
00:25:33,461 --> 00:25:36,095
It appears that we cannot continue...

359
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:38,388
Should we take a listen to the song now?

360
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:42,693
Yes, here is Kang Jin's live performance of Dooruh.

361
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:45,430
Thank you very much!

362
00:25:56,652 --> 00:26:03,817
<i>♫ Even though life is hard, I shouldn't get stressed out.</i>

363
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:10,994
<i>♫ Love makes me cry.</i><br><i>♫ Money makes me feel bad about myself.</i>

364
00:26:27,316 --> 00:26:29,931
My apologies to everyone.

365
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:34,527
I kept on thinking about sad and difficult times of my life.

366
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:38,952
I'm sorry. I'll try to sing well.

367
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:43,098
<i>♫ Break away... Break away...</i><br><i>♫ Break away... Break away... Break away...</i>

368
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:46,186
<i>♫ I'll break away from my suffocating life.</i>

369
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:51,932
<i>♫ I'll take charge. I'll just run towards...</i>

370
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:00,777
Yes, oppa.

371
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:02,710
Did you hear the broadcasting?

372
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,737
I was listening and thought it so absurd that

373
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:08,306
I bet you're kind of unhappy, Oppa?

374
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:12,791
This was a hard earned interview opportunity. I'm so mad.

375
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:16,027
I feel a little stressed. Do you want to have dinner with me?

376
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:17,106
Do you have time?

377
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:21,308
Of course! I have time.

378
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:22,722
Yes.

379
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:25,644
Then I'll see you there.

380
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:30,916
What do I wear today?

381
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:51,866
What are doing over there?

382
00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:54,548
Nothing.

383
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,443
She really is cheating. My feeling was right

384
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:36,726
♫ Love is that not anyone ♫

385
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:42,821
♫ not something that everyone can know ♫

386
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:47,617
♫ I came to know it only today ♫

387
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:50,600
<i>These people are acting without fear in the middle of the day?!&gt;</i>

388
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,092
<i>Whichever bastard this is, just you come home, wife.</i>

389
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:55,215
<i>I'm going to teach him a big lesson</i>

390
00:28:55,215 --> 00:29:00,883
♫ Did you love me? ♫

391
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:07,313
♫ If it's that, do say that to me ♫

392
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:13,570
♫ Should I go back? ♫

393
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,393
♫ There's nothing I can do ♫

394
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:24,521
Encore! Encore!

395
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:29,191
She must have gone crazy. What are you doing?

396
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:35,274
Now.

397
00:29:36,806 --> 00:29:40,502
A guy that looks as slippery as the Yin Jeol Mi (rice cake) that has a coat of sesame oil

398
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:42,741
He's a total gigolo even at one look.

399
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:46,225
Why did you already come? You should sing a few more.

400
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:50,541
I was feeling so off put that I sang a song.

401
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,579
This is a place where singers who signed with the company performs occasionally.

402
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:56,178
Yah, after seeing your face

403
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:59,550
my frustration has completely gone away.

404
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:05,812
<i>"My Sook i"? "<br>That, that, that courtesan's brother like gigolo!"</i>

405
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:12,510
Actually, there is somewhere that I want to take you.

406
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,133
With me? Where?

407
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,140
Oh my god, this is a luxury brand retailer that I've only heard about.

408
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,111
Gang Sook do you like luxury brand?

409
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:26,329
How can I on my situation?

410
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:30,836
What luxury brand would you need when you yourself is a luxury brand?

411
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:35,501
Oh my my, that's non-sense. How could I be...

412
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:38,081
You came, President.

413
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:42,182
Bring out the ones that I picked and show it to her.

414
00:30:42,182 --> 00:30:43,171
Ok.

415
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:53,375
which one do you like?

416
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,281
<i>"The fact that he hasn't been able to date shows clearly."</i>

417
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:59,453
How can you ask a girl to pick out the proposal ring.

418
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:02,442
Is there nothing that you like? Should I tell her to bring more?

419
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,457
No, no.

420
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:09,959
This one seems to be the prettiest.

421
00:31:11,232 --> 00:31:15,104
As I thought, my Sook, you have a discerning eyes.

422
00:31:15,104 --> 00:31:17,595
That's the one I picked too.

423
00:31:17,595 --> 00:31:18,876
Yes.

424
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,952
Get this ready. When will I be able to get it?

425
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:23,691
In a week.

426
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:26,616
Ok, a week.

427
00:31:26,616 --> 00:31:27,831
Lets go.

428
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:29,577
So we're done?

429
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:32,177
Why? Is there anything else that you like?

430
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:36,911
I'll buy it for you, so tell me. Do you want a necklace? or a bracelet?

431
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:43,518
Just the ring on it's own is very expensive. How could I ask for a necklace or bracelet too.

432
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:45,747
No, that's fine.

433
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,916
Then lets go eat.

434
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:59,390
What kind of ring did those people, that just left, look at?

435
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,123
You mean this?

436
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:03,149
How much is this?

437
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:05,433
Fifty million won.

438
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:09,069
Fifty million won??

439
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:17,901
Honey, I am taking another look at you.

440
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,574
I thought you were a miser who would shiver at the thought of spending even a penny,

441
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:28,686
but you charge a huge amount on a credit card so that your wife can get her teeth fixed, and

442
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:34,392
I didn't realize what a big spender Mr. Um Paeng Dal was in the past.

443
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:37,343
It's not cause your pretty that I did this.

444
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:39,345
No?

445
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:46,317
If you can't chew properly, it might lead to other issues.

446
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:49,702
Later it might give the children a difficult time.

447
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:53,084
I'm doing the prep work ahead of time.

448
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:58,341
If I get dementia, you're going to pass me off on the kids?

449
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:04,203
If I get dementia, for certain, you have to feed me and change my poopy diaper.

450
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:07,392
Why are you making your children do the hard work?

451
00:33:07,392 --> 00:33:10,259
Talk about your meanness.

452
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:14,888
What's wrong? Are you sick somewhere?

453
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:16,971
No. Nothing's wrong.

454
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:21,889
What do you mean no when you're sweating so much?

455
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:25,064
Let's rest for a bit.

456
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:27,418
Yes, I understand

457
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:29,319
Ahhhhhhhh!<br> Honey! Honey!

458
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,279
Ki Moon's Father!

459
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,872
A person has collapsed over here!<br> Please save him!

460
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:37,812
Honey you can't loose consciousness.

461
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:40,314
Please save this person!

462
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:43,556
Grandfather are you okay? Come to your senses.

463
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:45,658
Can you please take him to the hospital?

464
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:48,528
Honey! Honey! You can't loose consciousness.

465
00:33:48,554 --> 00:33:51,494
Honey you have to stay conscious

466
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,090
Yes. Hello

467
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,774
Mom?

468
00:33:58,137 --> 00:33:59,699
Mom, what's wrong?

469
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,050
Why are you crying?

470
00:34:03,397 --> 00:34:05,691
Mom is crying? Why?

471
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,290
Emergency room?

472
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:13,343
Dad fainted?

473
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,742
Mom?

474
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:32,620
You came?

475
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,397
Just what happened?

476
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:37,228
Why would he suddenly faint?

477
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:40,079
How could this happen?

478
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:42,058
Why mom?

479
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:46,397
Your father...Your father...

480
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,244
What about father?

481
00:34:48,244 --> 00:34:51,855
Did the doctor say something was bad?

482
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:54,303
They said it's cancer.

483
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:56,284
What?

484
00:34:56,284 --> 00:35:00,909
I didn't know at all, your dad kept it hidden until now.

485
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:06,945
Aigoo, what are we supposed to about this? What do we do about this?

486
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,369
Dad?

487
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,653
You didn't hear wrong, right mom?

488
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:18,309
What misunderstanding? The doctor told me just a while ago.

489
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:20,293
Grandfather..

490
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:24,379
told me to keep it a secret.

491
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:26,428
You knew?

492
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,789
Yes.

493
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:32,283
He fainted before in the factory.

494
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:34,675
So we brought him to the hospital.

495
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:38,451
If something like that happened you should've told me.

496
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:41,702
why would you keep your mouth shut?

497
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:44,503
Chae Won has no fault.

498
00:35:44,503 --> 00:35:46,375
I wouldn't let her.

499
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,939
Honey.

500
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,549
Dad.

501
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:53,397
Help me up. I'm going home.

502
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:55,770
What do you mean go home?

503
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,235
You have to stay in the hospital and get treatment.

504
00:35:58,235 --> 00:36:00,800
I know my illness the best.

505
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,255
If I rest at home I'll be okay.

506
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:08,123
Stay quietly put.

507
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:12,360
Grandfather.

508
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:28,032
<i> Subtitles brought to you by the Inheritance team @Viki </i>

509
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,931
You...

510
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:33,606
What are you doing here.

511
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:35,384
I heard it from Se Yoon.

512
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,424
How are you doing?

513
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:40,236
The doctor said

514
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:43,205
I can be discharged tomorrow.

515
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:49,981
Then when you get discharged, I'll also return home.

516
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:58,417
Se Yoon decided to go back to America.

517
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:01,405
What did you say?

518
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:03,727
Even if it's a little difficult right now,

519
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:08,995
he'll come to understand including about the wedding.

520
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:10,536
Then..

521
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:13,187
What about Chae Won?

522
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:19,146
Se Yoon can't leave,

523
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:23,912
until he marries Chae Won.

524
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:27,308
What are you saying right now?

525
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:28,675
Are you in the right state of mind?

526
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:31,391
Of course I'm not, that's why I ate pills

527
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:32,381
Honey.

528
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:34,411
Choon Hee left home.

529
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:39,697
She left, so there would be no problem with them getting married.

530
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:45,360
But how could you hold on to your greed until the end?

531
00:37:45,575 --> 00:37:47,366
Greed?

532
00:37:47,906 --> 00:37:52,231
Does this look like greed in your eyes?

533
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:55,911
Please stop.

534
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:57,977
Calm down.

535
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:13,741
I told him it was my wish to go to America.

536
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:19,299
If this is because of me, do something else.

537
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:29,274
Me unto you, I'm destroying your house.

538
00:38:30,187 --> 00:38:32,466
I'm sorry Se Yoon.

539
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:54,368
Coming and going is part of life.

540
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:56,725
No need to make this serious.

541
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:59,401
When you are young,

542
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:04,068
death felt heavier than a high mountain.

543
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:07,043
now that I've become this age

544
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,778
lighter than the bird feather.

545
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:18,242
In addition,

546
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:24,188
I worried that what if the 3rd generational family business ends on my generation.

547
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:26,512
I was most worried but

548
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:29,735
luckily, you guys inherited, so

549
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:35,518
I don't have anything else to wish for since the company is now growing well.

550
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:39,060
Why do you keep talking weakly?

551
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:44,327
Go to the hospital and get another examination Dad.

552
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,931
Yes Father in law

553
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:49,573
I haven't even done anything for you yet.

554
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:52,388
I can't send you off like this.

555
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:54,804
You made a promise to me.

556
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:57,531
50 years.

557
00:39:58,404 --> 00:40:02,955
If you come even one day before 50 years,

558
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:07,038
I will wait for you at heaven's door.

559
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:10,105
and punish you. Understand that.

560
00:40:10,105 --> 00:40:14,578
Yes father in law, I'll be sure to keep that promise.

561
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:18,120
It's possible that the doctor could have misdiagnosed!

562
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,715
Let's go to another hospital and get a second opinion.

563
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:24,913
I've already done all of that. Nothing's going to change.

564
00:40:24,913 --> 00:40:30,617
Father, go to the hospital for treatment anyway, father.

565
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:35,416
That way you can live a bit longer.

566
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:38,094
Let's go to the hospital today father.

567
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:40,616
I'm a noodle fool.

568
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,853
A noodle fool must die smelling flour.

569
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:49,783
would you rather I die smelling the disinfectant instead?

570
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,232
Why do you keep talking about dying?

571
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:57,949
I can't let you go dad.

572
00:40:58,212 --> 00:41:01,901
Father. Father. Father.

573
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:08,549
I can't let you go dad.

574
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:13,572
Dad.

575
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:18,561
Son in law Min...

576
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:21,771
Yes Father in law

577
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:26,182
Send a message to Chaewon's mom

578
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:29,593
Tell her before I die

579
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:33,760
that I must see her on more time.

580
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:36,604
Tell her to come.

581
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:41,754
Yes. I'll do that.

582
00:41:43,388 --> 00:41:46,741
Your father hasn't died yet.

583
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:49,850
I can't just go without giving you a hard time first.

584
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,933
that that mean grumpy old man, eww.

585
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:08,136
<i> Subtitles brought to you by the Inheritance team @Viki </i>

586
00:42:35,577 --> 00:42:37,469
<i>It's new voice mail."</i>

587
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:39,309
Mom, it's me.

588
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,772
Se Yoon..

589
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:47,067
I heard everything from Chae Won awhile ago.

590
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:51,718
You've suffered from heartache all your life so

591
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,842
I cannot hurt you again.

592
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:59,610
Our marriage born of your suffering

593
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,266
that you can't be happy.

594
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:09,419
We will break up.

595
00:43:11,185 --> 00:43:14,187
So return to your family mom.

596
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:27,857
I can't do that.

597
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,809
I'm a mother who hasn't done anything for you your whole life.

598
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:36,377
Even if you do this...

599
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:40,735
The only thing I can do for you is to protect your happiness.

600
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:01,959
You've worked hard all this time Ajumma.

601
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:06,375
No. It's okay.

602
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,618
It's not much.

603
00:44:08,618 --> 00:44:11,927
Because I'm giving it, please accept it.

604
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,833
Thank you.

605
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:30,464
Mom,

606
00:44:30,464 --> 00:44:34,124
we've cleared out everything so we should also leave.

607
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:41,481
How can I leave my house?

608
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:48,748
I've established our business hearing a loan-shark from people,

609
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:53,568
not eating what I wanted and not wear what I wanted, like living like dead...aigoo

610
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:57,656
Aiyoo, I'm too aggrieved to take it as is and return.

611
00:44:57,656 --> 00:45:01,483
I can't go back now.

612
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:10,787
Within 3 years I will get us this house back mom,

613
00:45:10,787 --> 00:45:12,428
so just believe in me.

614
00:45:12,428 --> 00:45:16,948
If I find that Hong attorney or that weasel, I'm going to

615
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:20,106
scratch his eyes out.

616
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:23,651
What are you still doing here?

617
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:25,816
Hey!

618
00:45:25,816 --> 00:45:29,015
If you didn't make those noodles or whatever this...

619
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:32,291
this wouldn't have happened.

620
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:34,540
There's no enemy like you.

621
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,501
In any case it's already in the past.

622
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:37,904
Please stop Mom.

623
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:41,303
What? It's already in the pass so I should stop.

624
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:42,854
Yah!

625
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:45,955
You blow away my entire life's worth of assets in one moment

626
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:50,252
and honestly can talk like that?

627
00:45:50,252 --> 00:45:51,863
Then what do you want me to do?

628
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:53,631
Should I should just die in front of you?

629
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:54,911
How can you be so rude?

630
00:45:54,911 --> 00:45:56,403
What kind of behavior is this towards your mom?

631
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:59,573
What did you do well that you are making such a fuss.

632
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:02,451
I'm really going insane!

633
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:10,407
Since this already happened don't pay attention to her.

634
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:15,408
Ai, I'm so upset and aggrieved...

635
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:18,731
I already told you...

636
00:46:18,731 --> 00:46:20,515
your son will earn money in 3 years

637
00:46:20,515 --> 00:46:23,739
and get back this house and also get back the company.

638
00:46:25,852 --> 00:46:30,251
For today let's get out of here.

639
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:40,156
Aigoo let's go. Hurry!

640
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:42,040
Let's go

641
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,222
Just go

642
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:56,972
Is this where we're going to live?

643
00:46:56,972 --> 00:47:00,361
The 3 of us are supposed to live in this place?

644
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:03,375
Well, it's a good place.

645
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:06,664
Aigoo...

646
00:47:07,234 --> 00:47:12,748
I leave my perfectly nice house and what am I doing?

647
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:16,281
The rich takes 3 years to lose its wealth,

648
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:21,739
how can we be so completely broke suddenly?

649
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,467
This is embarrassing. What's wrong with you?

650
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:25,173
People are staring at us.

651
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:28,615
What's embarrassing when we all just became poppers?

652
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:31,776
Can you be of sound mind in a time like this?

653
00:47:32,387 --> 00:47:34,257
This is so humiliating.

654
00:47:37,612 --> 00:47:39,648
Get up

655
00:47:40,503 --> 00:47:45,097
Aigoo, my mom does a one heck of a moving notice!

656
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:47,189
Hello

657
00:47:47,189 --> 00:47:49,841
We are the people moving into 102.

658
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:52,968
We put ourselves in your care from now on.

659
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:55,962
Aigoo.

660
00:47:55,962 --> 00:48:00,894
I don't think you can fit even 1/10th of your belongings we moved here.

661
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:03,112
If you make monthly payment

662
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:05,637
there's a place that keep your belongings in a storage container.

663
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:06,746
Keep your stuff there for the time being and

664
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:10,876
How can I shove my life's furnishing that I toiled for in a storage place?

665
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:12,072
I can't.

666
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:13,582
I can't do that.

667
00:48:13,582 --> 00:48:17,206
No matter how we try, in this house you can only fit less than 1/10th.

668
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:18,609
Look here, madam.

669
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:21,526
one false move, you're going to end up living with your furnishings on your head.

670
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:26,664
Whether I live with my furnishing or wear them on my back, why are you talking so much?

671
00:48:26,664 --> 00:48:29,479
If you came to move our stuff, focus on that, why do you have so much to say?

672
00:48:29,479 --> 00:48:31,867
Ai, see here old lady. Where do you get off shoving fingers in my face?

673
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,964
Unlucky!<br>What?

674
00:48:32,964 --> 00:48:33,495
What?

675
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:34,340
Grandmother?

676
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,638
Unlucky?

677
00:48:35,638 --> 00:48:37,823
Did you do anything for me when I became a Hal Mo Ni (grandma)?

678
00:48:37,823 --> 00:48:38,831
Did you help me at all?

679
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:39,713
Mom! Mom!<br>Let go!

680
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:41,017
Did you help me?<br>Aigoo

681
00:48:41,017 --> 00:48:42,949
Mom! Please stop this!

682
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:44,351
Aye, that's enough. Stop it now.

683
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:45,338
Aigoo<br>COMMON!

684
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:48,264
Quickly go to work.

685
00:48:56,543 --> 00:48:58,976
Come in, Chae Won.

686
00:49:00,346 --> 00:49:01,431
Hello.

687
00:49:01,431 --> 00:49:04,225
You must have a production meeting in a conference room?

688
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:05,899
Yes.

689
00:49:06,304 --> 00:49:07,510
Then.

690
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,908
Min Chae Won you also will come to the farewell party, right?

691
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:12,920
A farewell party?

692
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,637
The director is leaving to go to America next week.

693
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:30,588
I have another appointment, so I'll be leaving first.

694
00:49:35,203 --> 00:49:37,834
Did you really not know?

695
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:41,960
You didn't hear anything from the director?

696
00:49:57,468 --> 00:49:59,354
I've already completed your discharge paperwork so

697
00:49:59,354 --> 00:50:00,918
you can just go straight home.

698
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:01,779
Why did you come?

699
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:03,627
I could have gone on my own.

700
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:05,377
This type of service

701
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,754
is only for a few days more.

702
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:12,483
Your mom...

703
00:50:12,483 --> 00:50:14,816
hasn't contacted you yet?

704
00:50:16,689 --> 00:50:18,094
Not yet.

705
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,465
I called Sister a little bit ago.

706
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:25,085
but she didn't go there either.

707
00:50:25,085 --> 00:50:27,966
I can't think of where she might have gone.

708
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:34,432
Excuse me.

709
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:38,495
Hello.

710
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:41,740
I don't know if your busy or not.

711
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,686
It's me.

712
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:44,750
No I'm not Grandfather.

713
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:48,305
Because I lack strength

714
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:51,626
I'll get right to the point.

715
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:56,089
I, for my granddaughter,

716
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,065
have never thought of another person besides you for her.

717
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:03,883
Next to Chae Won -

718
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:05,986
you need to be there.

719
00:51:05,986 --> 00:51:07,552
Grandfather.

720
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:10,710
I'll ask you for the last time.

721
00:51:11,232 --> 00:51:13,399
Our Chae Won,

722
00:51:13,399 --> 00:51:17,591
you have to take responsibility for her.

723
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,416
That way,

724
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:22,573
I will be able to close my eyes.

725
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:37,938
Father-in-law is very ill.

726
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:42,216
He wants to see your face for the last time.

727
00:51:42,216 --> 00:51:45,503
Come home when you receive this request.

728
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:48,208
Stop causing people to bleed out with pain

729
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:52,021
and obey his words, Choon Hee.

730
00:52:13,872 --> 00:52:16,347
If you just lay around, what can you do?

731
00:52:16,347 --> 00:52:18,758
Go and serve your father

732
00:52:18,758 --> 00:52:21,153
and be by his side at least.

733
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:24,605
When I was a child

734
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:27,482
I caused a lot of grief.

735
00:52:28,537 --> 00:52:30,646
When I was going to school

736
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:32,333
I didn't study

737
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,404
I hung out with bad kids

738
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:38,743
so I gave so much trouble to him

739
00:52:39,612 --> 00:52:42,208
I refused to take on the family business

740
00:52:42,753 --> 00:52:45,228
take off this way and that

741
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:49,564
there isn't a single son as bad as me

742
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,600
anywhere in the whole world.

743
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:55,037
Still in the end, you straightened up and did factory work diligently so

744
00:52:55,037 --> 00:52:58,160
your father was satisfied.

745
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,093
Even still,

746
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,335
good that's come of this bad situation is

747
00:53:03,137 --> 00:53:05,392
The fact that dad

748
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:07,966
doesn't have to know,

749
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:10,829
that we got a divorce.

750
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:13,346
is a relief.

751
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:18,553
Thanks, Kang Suk.

752
00:53:18,553 --> 00:53:19,547
Wa-wha

753
00:53:19,547 --> 00:53:20,678
For what?

754
00:53:20,678 --> 00:53:24,783
For not saying anything to him.

755
00:53:26,932 --> 00:53:30,380
I will decide in near future.

756
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,758
Wha-

757
00:53:31,758 --> 00:53:34,548
What do you mean?

758
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:43,657
Boy he sure talks as if he's on to me.

759
00:53:46,228 --> 00:53:47,522
Brother-in-law.

760
00:53:47,522 --> 00:53:48,286
Are you going somewhere?

761
00:53:48,286 --> 00:53:51,354
Father in law want to see he whole family.

762
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:53,621
He want's to take a family picture.

763
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:54,740
Family picture?

764
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,035
Yes,

765
00:53:56,035 --> 00:53:57,702
I'll call the photographer.

766
00:53:57,702 --> 00:54:01,965
Call Sister in law and tell her to come here with Son in law Kang.

767
00:54:01,965 --> 00:54:04,704
Suddenly why are we taking family picture?

768
00:54:04,704 --> 00:54:06,109
Making me nervous.

769
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,009
We don't have time, quickly do it.

770
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:10,532
Chae Won,

771
00:54:10,532 --> 00:54:12,562
Where are you right now?

772
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:16,429
Yes,

773
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:18,961
Work just ended and I'm on my way home.

774
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:22,555
Then grab a taxi and come quickly.

775
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:24,137
Why?

776
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,632
Is Grandfather getting worse?

777
00:54:26,632 --> 00:54:28,215
No,

778
00:54:28,215 --> 00:54:32,161
He wants to gather the family and take a family picture.

779
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:34,614
Family picture?

780
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,697
Ok.

781
00:54:36,697 --> 00:54:39,404
I will come right away.

782
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:57,594
Chae Won.

783
00:55:00,944 --> 00:55:03,560
If you say "don't go", I won't leave.

784
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,746
If you tell me not to go to the American branch,

785
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:10,100
I won't go.

786
00:55:15,602 --> 00:55:17,217
Should

787
00:55:18,564 --> 00:55:20,715
I not go?

Ai, Hal Mo Ni and the children's facial expression is rather dark,

799
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:09,929
Happily smile please.

800
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:11,086
Kimchi,

801
00:56:11,086 --> 00:56:13,074
Cheese,

802
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:15,328
Smile.

803
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:19,121
Ey, you are too stiff!

804
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:21,673
Please smile brightly.

805
00:56:22,404 --> 00:56:26,574
Smiling pig's head (used for festivals etc.) fetches higher price, they say!

806
00:56:26,574 --> 00:56:28,562
Don't scrunch your faces and

807
00:56:28,562 --> 00:56:30,788
Just smile.

808
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:33,490
Yes elder your expression is very good.

809
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,760
One,

810
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,265
Two,

811
00:56:36,265 --> 00:56:37,172
Three.

812
00:56:37,172 --> 00:56:39,330
Wait.

813
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,778
Min son-in-law

814
00:56:41,778 --> 00:56:43,438
Yes, elder.

815
00:56:43,438 --> 00:56:46,465
Come sit next to me.

816
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:53,477
Come here.

817
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:55,391
Yes.

818
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,464
Thanks for everything.

819
00:57:07,111 --> 00:57:09,073
you

820
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:11,350
aren't my son-in-law,

821
00:57:11,818 --> 00:57:14,065
but my son.

822
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,182
Yes.

823
00:57:20,843 --> 00:57:22,914
Thank you,

824
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:26,158
father.

825
00:57:31,558 --> 00:57:34,885
Then I'm taking the picture now.

826
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:37,137
Everybody smile together.

827
00:57:37,137 --> 00:57:38,749
One,

828
00:57:38,749 --> 00:57:40,269
two,

829
00:57:40,269 --> 00:57:42,173
three.

831
00:58:51,418 --> 00:58:53,111
Even though I've said this before,

832
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:56,149
noodles are for cold days

833
00:58:56,149 --> 00:58:58,413
It's comfort food.

834
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:01,789
Before I die, this is my last request.

835
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,940
On the day of my funeral

836
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:08,901
make seriously delicious noodles

837
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:11,310
and serve it.

838
00:59:28,614 --> 00:59:30,929
Chae Won.

839
00:59:35,116 --> 00:59:37,221
Why did you...

840
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,647
Even though our relationship isn't good

841
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,861
since grandfather passed away I had to come.

842
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:45,055
Give your greetings and leave.

843
00:59:45,055 --> 00:59:46,896
Chae Won.

844
00:59:48,825 --> 00:59:50,985
This may be shameless but

845
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,288
can you comfort me.

846
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,954
To be honest,

847
01:00:00,878 --> 01:00:02,949
I'm very scared.

848
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,594
The company is completely ruined and

849
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:10,433
we got kicked out of our home.

850
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:14,676
We moved to a place like mole's underground dwelling...

851
01:00:16,918 --> 01:00:21,356
In front of Joori and my Mom I pretend that it's nothing but

852
01:00:25,974 --> 01:00:29,371
truthfully several times a day I feel thiis way.

853
01:00:30,986 --> 01:00:36,154
I sometimes feel like I'm being punished by the heaven for all the ill deeds mom and I have done against you in the past

854
01:00:37,064 --> 01:00:40,605
Everyday is like living in hell.

855
01:00:41,783 --> 01:00:45,198
But if you give me some encouragement

856
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:51,009
I will draw up some strength this time.

857
01:00:57,514 --> 01:00:59,590
Chul Gyo.

858
01:01:00,037 --> 01:01:02,889
You are a strong person.

859
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:07,243
You can start again.

860
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,315
Thanks, Chae Won.

861
01:01:16,322 --> 01:01:20,599
I missed your one word like that until I went crazy.

862
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,035
Because you cheered me on,

863
01:01:24,903 --> 01:01:26,884
I truly

864
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:30,609
will be brave!

865
01:01:33,957 --> 01:01:36,590
Stop it now.
