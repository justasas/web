00:00:01,682 --> 00:00:03,316
Hey, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom real quick.

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:04,334
I want to look in the mirror

00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:05,902
and make sure
I'm still dead in the eyes.

00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:09,688
You think you can
handle my section?

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,075
Uh, yeah,
I think I can handle it.

6
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:14,927
Hey, Earl,
I don't know if you noticed,

7
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,529
but I'm running
the whole diner right now.

8
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:18,631
What, what?

00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,200
The customer at table ten
appears to be choking,

10
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:23,002
and I would help,

11
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,254
but the last time I gave
a white woman the heimlich,

12
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:28,207
I did six months
in the Birmingham city jail.

13
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:31,010
Oh, my God, are you choking?

14
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:33,512
Oh, my God,
I feel like you're choking!

15
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:35,147
Is anyone here a doctor?

16
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,983
What am I saying?
I forgot where I am.

00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:39,935

ever seen <i>Scrubs?</i>

What do we do?

21
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:50,413
What do we do?

stop talking like you're
in a Tyler Perry movie.

44
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,964
And secondly,

45
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:58,717
Caroline's here;
She's in the kitchen.

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,635

gonna need a pap smear.

79
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,575
we can steal away from here
to get the cupcake shop ready.

80
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:14,959

I just stick my face in it.

86

So, my brilliant idea
of how we get this all done

87
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,142
is we should
get an intern to help.

88
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,094
What? No.

89
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,846
I can't be a person
that has an intern.

90
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,066
I can barely be a person
that doesn't have an intern.

91
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,635
Max, all businesses
use interns.

92
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,471
We just have to post an ad
online at NYU or Columbia,

93
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,490
and we'll have
20 applicants battling it out

94
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,991
to do our grunt work
for credit.

My people were interns

00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:05,043
I am just getting used to the
idea of having my own business

101
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,828
and now you want me
to be someone's boss?

102
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,463
I am not the boss.

00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,633

and tape up the windows so we
can start the trim tomorrow.

very good at painting,

128
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,573
but I can do this
while you paint.

129
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,924

00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,726

just get an intern?

he saw some rat droppings.

140

is set up some traps.

So, Ruth,
you are a sophomore at NYU,

144
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,600
majoring in finance?
You know you're not

145
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,485
gonna get paid.
No money at all.

146
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,773
Yup, it's in internship.
I mean, it's all good, right?

147
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,276
It's all good
until you need money.

148
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,495
Well, we're a startup company,

149
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,664
and we're launching
our very first retail store,

150
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,283
so there's a lot of details
that you'll be responsible for.

151
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,052
There's a lot
of carrying things,

152
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,588
maybe some trapping things.

153
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,640
Oh, it's cool.
I have a car.

154
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:18,760
You have a car
and you want to be an intern?

155
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,144
How 'bout if we switch places?

156
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,512
I'll be the intern
with the car,

157
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,730
and you can sit
on a broken folding chair

158
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,482

159
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,301
Well, Max and I need to have
a little meeting right now,

160
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,987
so if you could go
over to the waiting room,

161
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,321
that'd be great.
Okay, Ruth?

162
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,990
I just wanna say

163
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:36,160
I know my name is weird,
but like it's too late, right?

164
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,913
Max, why are you
trying to convince her

165
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,198
to not be our intern?

166
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,950
Why are you not saying,

167
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:45,703
"You may get rabies and
bubonic plague from our rats?"

168
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,090
Don't mention the rats.

169
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,659
You're chasing them away.
And we do not have rats.

170
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,762
We have rat droppings.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

171
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,597
You're right,
the rats are probably

172
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:59,183
just coming in here
to use the bathroom.

173
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:03,504
Look, we need an intern.
Now, who do you like so far?

174
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,172
The one with the big boobs.

175
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:09,027
I knew it. All you big boob
people stick together.

176
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,813
Hi, girls.

177
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:13,681
Are you having
a beauty contest

178
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,068
and didn't invite me to give
the other girls a chance?

179
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,320
We're interviewing people
to be our intern.

180
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,322
Who doesn't get paid.

181
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,624
Well, this is for you.

182
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:25,877
You didn't have to do that.

183
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,695
You already gave us
the money for the shop.

184
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,081
I know, I'm too wonderful.

185
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,466
But it's for good luck,

186
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,251
and sounds like
you're gonna need it.

187
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,704
Oleg says that it's
rat central station around here.

188
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,091
Not rats, Sophie,
just rat droppings.

189
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,226
Oh, just rat droppings.

190
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,147
Oh, okay, no problem there.
[Laughs]

191
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,383
Are you out of breath

192
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,154
because you jogged here
all the way from 1974?

193
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,989
Sexy, huh?

194
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:59,160
You should see
his badunkadunk when he jogs.

195
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:02,030
Well, here they are.
60 rat traps.

196
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:06,918
Girls...

197
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,287
I don't want to interfere
with your business,

198
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,757
but what the hell
is goin' on here?

199
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,593
There's no fancy tables
or pretty chairs.

200
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,046
I mean, this place
is so unappealing,

201
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:22,133
even I don't look good here.

202
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:27,088
No worries.

203
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,607
We have some adorable old-school
ice cream tables and chairs

204
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,860
on hold at a kooky,
fun Staten Island junkyard.

205
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:34,695
Wow.

206
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,114
I can't believe you didn't
just shoot a blood clot

207
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,200
trying to make
dump furniture sound cute.

208
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:43,371
Okay, girls, well, call me
when you have a real business.

209
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,323
Yeah, and I'm--
I'm gonna take this,

210
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,291
you know, so that the rats
don't poop in it.

211
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,145
Come on, badunkadunk.

212
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,081
Oh, and, uh, Max...

213
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,883
Oh, she's good. Yes.

214
00:08:55,885 --> 00:09:00,054
I knew it. All you big boob
people stick together.

215
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,560
Well?

216
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:08,362
Here we are.

217
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,231
The final three.

218
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,904
Well, you know the one I like.
I'll give you a clue.

219
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:19,240
One, two.

220
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:22,076
Standing in front of me
I see two beautiful,

221
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,861
qualified young women.

222
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,664
Is she really
going all <i>Top Model</i> right now?

223
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,834
If only. They pay.

224
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,754
I'm out, Tyra.

225
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:35,656
Ruth, congratulations.

226
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,175
You've been selected
to be our intern.

227
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,845
Max, will you get Ruth
started on something?

228
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,847
Yup, I got the internship.

229
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:43,831
Um...

230
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,366
You know what?
I got it.

231
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,969
It's not like
you're getting paid.

232
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,306
Big boob people
are so much easier.

233
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:11,458
As a kid, people told you

234
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,627
everything you did was amazing,
didn't they?

235
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:16,629
I was given a lot
of positive reinforcement.

236
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:18,181
I think it gave me
the confidence

237
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:20,016
that's gotten me
through this last year.

238
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:22,619
Well, it's time
you heard the truth.

239
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,987
You stink at stuff.

240
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,139
Like painting.

241
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,641
Fine.
And you stink at stuff too.

242
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:30,894
Like telling an intern
what to do.

243
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,762
Ruth had to go
to that concert.

244
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,731
She had the tickets for weeks.

245
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,800
It was Ashley D and Ashley B's
joint birthday. Duh.

246
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:39,686
And so the intern's
out having fun,

247
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:44,357
and here we are, the bosses,
painting the walls at 3:00 a.m.

248
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,658
Well, I'm painting.

249
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,994
You got a kind of
autistic ballerina thing

250
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:50,413
going on over there.

251
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:51,814
Can I ask you something?

252
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,700
I don't like Maroon 5.

253
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:55,151
No matter
how many times you ask,

254
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,036
the answer will always be no.

255
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,755
Not that.

256
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:00,990
Would it be okay if I told Andy
not to come over tonight

257
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,592
'cause I'm so exhausted,

258
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,711
or is it a little too early
in the relationship to be all,

259
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:07,997
"I don't think I can have my
legs up around my ears tonight"?

260
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,000
It's fine.

261
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,833
You don't think
he'd enjoy a night off

262
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:13,636
from constant Maroon 5
badgering? He would.

263
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:16,305
Feels awkward. Can't.

264
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:18,557
My legs can go up there.
They're fine.

265
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,110
I don't want to have that
conversation right now.

266
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:22,645
Hey, look, I get it.

267
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,214
There are conversations
you don't want to have.

268
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:28,068
Like, "hey, Ruth, here's $0.
Put down some rat traps."

269
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,287
We have a box right here
that's not touched.

270
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,322
Look, we're not talking
about your relationship anymore.

271
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,291
We're done.

272
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,910
Relax. It's probably not even
a rat, it's probably a mouse.

273
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,829
Not a big deal.

274
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:42,749
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
I see it! There it is!

275
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,951
- The mouse?
- That is not a mouse!

276
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:47,337
That is a car
that a mouse drives!

277
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,889
Where did you see it?
It was in the middle, right?

278
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,092
- Shh!
- Why are you whispering?

279
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:53,626
I don't want him to hear me.

280
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:54,811
How do you know it's a he?

281
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:57,647
He looked at me kind of rapey.

282
00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:59,799
There!
He just ran behind the thing!

283
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,184
- What thing?
- That thing!

284
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,436
This thing? Waah!

285
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:04,738
What? Did you see it?

286
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,406
I don't think so.

287
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:07,490
Oh, you'd know so.
It has a saddle.

288
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:08,742
[Gasps]

289
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:13,980
Oh, my God.

290
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:17,867
He just opened the door with
the strength of his whiskers.

291
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,921
He's gone.
He went into the kitchen.

292
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:22,956
Oh, what should we do?

293
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,491
Should we call the cops?

294
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,960
He doesn't have a gun.

295
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,461
Let's just get out of here.

296
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:30,380
We'll call an exterminator
in the morning.

297
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,048
[Gasps]

298
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,817
Too late, he's coming back!

299
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,436
- Aah! He's charging us!
- He's gonna bite me!

300
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:39,439
[Growls]

301
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,780
Waah!
You can stop now!

302
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:50,533
You painted him to death.

303
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,576
I just got a glimpse of you
at a Barneys sample sale.

304
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,729
What a mess.
Who's gonna clean that up?

305
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:06,666
The intern?

306
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,370
Oh, Andy...

307
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:14,040
I know.
I'm good at this.

308
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,876
[Moaning increases,
turns to cries]

309
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,928
What?
Is there another rat?

310
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,647
What are you doing?

311
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,766
I forgot Andy was here!

312
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:27,970
And your sex voice is the same
as your murder voice.

313
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:30,857
So are you just
gonna stand there?

314
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:35,361
Are you offering me
a three-way?

315
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,897
[Buzzer sounds]

316
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,851
Well, it looks like we're
about to be a full-blown orgy.

317
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:44,353
It's 2:00 a.m.
Who could this be?

318
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,488
It's Ruth.

319
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,558
- Ruth?
- Yes. I'm late, right?

320
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,410
Why is she here?

321
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,413
I texted her and said
you needed an enema.

322
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,499
Okay, now, this is some
industrial-strength girl talk.

323
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,968
I had to do something
to show her who was boss.

324
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,970
I learned it while interning
at Condé Nast.

325
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,722
We've all
gotten someone an enema

326
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:04,557
in the middle of the night,
it's a rite of passage.

327
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,093
For someone to get
their passage right?

328
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:08,761
Beat me to it.

329

[Knock on door]

330
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:13,850
There. Go open the door.
You know what has to happen.

331
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,636
Max has to put Ruth
in her place

332
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,905
so she can learn
how to be a boss.

333
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:20,523
Oh. That's all? Good.

334
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,824
'Cause I thought
from your tone

335
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,693
you were gonna force Max
to have an enema.

336
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:25,528
Sorry I'm late.

337
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,699
I had the tiniest pot cookie and
had to pull over to take a nap.

338
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:34,003
Anyway, here is your enema.
Enjoy.

339
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,821
They only had the triple pack.

340
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,223
Wait, Ruth?

341
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:38,991
Max has something
she wants to say to you.

342
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,843
Max, what did you
want to say to Ruth?

343
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:44,714
Um, thanks for the triple?

00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,107
You sure you don't want me
to help you with that?

347
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:55,725
Oh, no, it's okay.

348
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:58,144
You took the rat traps out
of the box, you need a break.

349
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,445
Plus, we couldn't afford

350
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,114
the game <i>Mouse Trap</i>
when I was a kid,

351
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,449
and this is the closest
I'm gonna get.

352
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,735
So, when do you
make the cupcakes?

353
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:07,537
Um...

354
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,455
I guess I could make them now.

355
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,040
Fun.
I'll go get the coffees, right?

356
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,709
Sure, of course.
Do whatever.

357
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,579
You got a life.
Who am I to tell you what to do?

358
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,798
Well, here's our
Martha Stewart blurb,

359
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,301
all blown up and ready to roll
out and paste up on that wall.

360
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:24,671
- Where's Ruth?
- She's in the kitchen.

361
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,423
- I was just in there.
- Then she's in the bathroom.

362
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,543
Oh, my God, you're Haning me!

363
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:32,878
She took a coffee break.

364
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,015
What? She didn't need a break.
She just started 20 minutes ago.

365
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:38,067
[Scoffs] Your rich
is really coming out,

366
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:40,236
and it is not pretty.

367
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:41,854
Forgot my phone.

368
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:44,590
I mean, get it together,
Ruth, right?

369
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:46,242
Watch and learn.

370
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:49,162
Ruth, can you put the rat traps
down, one in each corner,

371
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:51,948
and then you can get coffee
later after interning.

372
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,232
Thanks.

373
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,369
She's kind of a tool, right?

374
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:01,257
Max, were you
saying something?

375
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,208
Nope.

376
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,676
[Trap snaps]
Ouch!

377
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:06,212
Right?

378
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:18,364
Oh, look at this cage.

379
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:21,651
I think my mom
used to dance in it.

380
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:23,903
Here they are.

381
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,789
These are the ones
I had the guy hold for us.

382
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,941
Only $600 for all of them.
What do ya think, Daddy?

383
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:32,745
I like 'em, doll.
Wrap 'em up.

384
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:34,914
And can Daddy
get something he wants?

385
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,133
So cute.
Over the counter?

386
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:39,469
And that way when I'm
hungover and taking a nap,

387
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:41,221
people can still
find the cupcakes.

388
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:43,306
We could have Ruth clean it

389
00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:44,808
and then paint
and reupholster these.

390
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,142
By the way, where is she?

391
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:48,127
She was supposed to
be here an hour ago.

392
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,129
Text her and find out
where she is.

393
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:52,816
Why are you so interested in
where she is, what she's doing?

394
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:54,501
Are you obsessed with her?

395
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:57,203
Max, I don't want to make
a purse out of her skin.

396
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:58,938
I just want her to do her job.

397
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,241
Never mind.
I'll just text her.

398
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:02,775
Well, be careful.

399
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:04,911
Don't delete any
of my penis with a hat pictures.

400
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,479
Even if I did,
it's not a big deal.

401
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,781
Oleg will always pose again.

402
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:12,452
Yeah, but I'll never get
that little pilgrim hat back.

403
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:16,005
"Where are you?
We needed you here yesterday."

404
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:18,258
All in caps,
'cause bosses talk in caps.

405
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,344
[Coughs]
Total tool.

406
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:23,012
[Phone chimes]
Look at that.

407
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:25,431
Texted right back,
'cause I'm the boss.

408
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,100
She says...

409
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:29,552
Yesterday was super hard
so she's not feeling great

410
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:31,504
and she can't come in today?

411
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,273
[Scoffs]
That's it. She's fired.

412
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,807
Here.
You have to fire her.

413
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,244
She said she was sick,
Condé Nasty.

414
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:40,947
She's not sick,
she's just taking advantage

415
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:42,398
'cause you're
too friendly with her.

416
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,033
She works for us.

417
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,018
Yeah, for free.

418
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,403
Why don't you just
hollow her out

419
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:50,039
and live inside of her,
you monster?

420
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,709
[Phone chimes]

421
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,713
Um, I don't think
we were supposed to get this.

422
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:59,299
"The dumb one wants me to pick
up all this crappy furniture.

423
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:01,668
"Right? As if.

424
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,587
I'll be at the bar in ten.
Order me a Bellini."

425
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,306
Oh, who's the monster now?

426
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,057
She just called you
the dumb one.

427
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,894
Uh, she called you
the dumb one.

428
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:13,263
It's your phone,
you're the dumb one.

429
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:15,481
She knows I don't talk
in caps, so that's to you.

430
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:16,816
You're the dumb one.

431
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:18,151
- Fire her.
- No, you fire her.

432
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:19,385
No, you fire her.

433
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,154
No, you hired her,
you fire her.

434
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:23,273
I wanted to go
with Molly big boobs.

435
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:26,776
She'd be here right now
with four chairs on each boob.

436
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:28,278
Why can't you just fire her?

437
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,029
It's clear she called you
the dumb one.

438
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:32,415
All right, fine, I know
she called me the dumb one.

439
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:35,735
But I can't fire her.
I want to, but there is a block.

440
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,420
Right here.

441
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:40,206
It comes up, and then goes,
"nope!" It goes right back down.

442
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,092
I am not supposed to
fire someone.

443
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:46,245
I am the someone
who's supposed to be fired.

444
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,348
So I guess I'm the boss, then.

445
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,850
Sounds like a plan.
I'll be in my mom's cage.

446
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:52,852
[Scoffs]

447
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:55,221
All right, come on,
you lowly worker.

448
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:57,256
Help the boss
pull these chairs out.

449
00:18:57,258 --> 00:18:59,826
Don't yell at me, boss.
I'm blocked.

450
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:02,111
Wish you had your enemas now,
don't you?

451
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:06,966
[Both screaming]

452
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:09,535
They followed us!
We walked into a trap!

453
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:10,987
It's a vendetta!

454
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,438
Ugh, I can't believe this!

455
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,790
Our intern's
out having cocktails

456
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,241
and I'm trapped
on top of rat mountain!

457
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:17,610
[Screams]
He's coming after me!

458
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:20,029
Whoa--whoa!

459
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:21,714
[Screams]
Oh, my God!

460
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:24,217
Max! Help!

461
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,952
No, you bastards!
Get off her!

462
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:28,521
Aah!

463
00:19:28,523 --> 00:19:30,173
Get off!

464
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,308
My foot's caught
under this thing!

465
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,461
[Grunts]

466
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:39,349
Aah!

467
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:42,134
Max, that was amazing.

468
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:45,071
You just lifted that
giant thing up with one hand.

469
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:46,356
I know.

470
00:19:46,358 --> 00:19:49,610
And now I'm gonna
fire that bitch!

471
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:57,367
Wow. You suck at this too.

472
00:19:57,869 --> 00:19:58,802
Sorry I'm late.

473
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,703
I was having a dream
that I was sleeping in,

474
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:03,790
then I woke up, and I was.

475
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,328
Who's the boss?

476
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,963
Tony Danza?

477
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:13,466
No, Max, who's the boss?

478
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:15,685
I am.

479
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:17,570
Have a seat, Ruth.

480
00:20:17,572 --> 00:20:19,004
Here?

481
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:20,940
Good call.

482
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,060
In addition to being a boss,

483
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,695
I am also a waitress.

484
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:28,347
But when I do my job,
I don't call people dumb.

485
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:30,516
All right, I do, but at least
it's to their face.

486
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:32,568
Oh, you're talking
about that thing?

487
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,020
I meant Caroline.

488
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,521
No, I know you meant me,

489
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:38,157
because I'm not dumb
and neither is Caroline.

490
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,359
And one thing I figured out
is that in business,

491
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,194
maybe I have to be
a little more ruthless.

492
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,048
Meaning no more Ruth.
You're fired.

493
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,201
So, I'm not
getting college credit?

494
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,304
I'll probably
get kicked out of school again,

495
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:53,573
but no worries, right?

496
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:01,046
I'm really proud of how
you stuck up for yourself.

497
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:04,817
You're fired.
Sorry, I can't stop.

498
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:08,354
Look, Max.

499
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:10,941
We're on our way.
