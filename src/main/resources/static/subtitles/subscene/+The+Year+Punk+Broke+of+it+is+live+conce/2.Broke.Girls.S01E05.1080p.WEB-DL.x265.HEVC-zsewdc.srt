1
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:05,155
Hi, it's been 20 minutes.
Have you decided?

2
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:07,255
Uh, we still need more time,
can you come back?

3
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:09,655
Sure. And I'm back.

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:13,555
Come on guys you're not buying a house.
Everything sucks.

5
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:16,355
Pick the thing that sucks the least,
and put it in you mouth.

6
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:18,655
Max, everyone keeps telling me
they can't decide,

7
00:00:18,956 --> 00:00:20,955
it's like a support group
for bi-sexuals.

8
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,255
Something very magical
about to happen...

9
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:27,407
Please let it be
the rapture.

10
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:28,975
I need a day off.

11
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:32,629
In two minutes,
something very hip is happening.

12
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:33,797
If you have a camera,

13
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,383
make sure the flash
is on.

14
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:39,085
Why is he speaking
like that?

15
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:41,254
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:42,806
No one's ordering.

17
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:45,142
People keep checking the time
on their phones.

18
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:49,546
Everyone's wearing
matching new balance sneakers.

19
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,031
Flash mob!

00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,784

I couldn't stop disco,
but I'll be damned

29
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:15,639
if any more of that crap
gets by me.

30
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:19,843
Why is flash mob over?

31
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:22,479
Flash mobs were over
a year ago.

32
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:24,481
Nobody told Han!

33
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:26,016
I want so bad to be hip.

34
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,085
Start by
never saying that again.

35
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:04,316
Hello?

36
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:05,484
Max, phone!

37
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:07,736
No!

38
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:09,238
What are you doing?

39
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:13,242
Only two people
call the wall...

40
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:14,443
collection agencies

41
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:16,161
and the landlord, looking
for the original tenant

42
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:17,079
whose name is on the lease!

43
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,697
- Hang up. Quick!
- Too late.

44
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:20,415
I've got to man up
and face it.

45
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:26,237
Hello?

46
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,423
This is what collection agency?

47
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:31,293
No, my granddaughter Max
is not here.

48
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:32,911
She died.

49
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,347
On her deathbed,
she said it was the stress

50
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,884
of being constantly harassed
by creditors.

51
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:40,369
That's juvenile.

52
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:42,871
Give me the phone.

53
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,856
Hi.
So sorry about that.

54
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,391
What's the issue exactly?

55
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:48,644
Well, I'm sure
she has every intention...

56
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:49,945
mm-hmm.

57
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:51,096
Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:52,698
Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,949
Oh.

60
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:57,903
Well, you're a doody head.

61
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:59,404
Never answer the wall.

62
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:01,523
But what are you
gonna do about it?

63
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:04,409
You can't just keep lying
to collection agencies.

64
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:06,662
You have to pay your bills.
I have a system.

65
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,279
I pay everyone
five dollars a week...

66
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,998
just enough to keep them
from freaking out.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,450
It's the methadone-clinic
banking system.

68
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:15,170
That is a complete waste
of money.

69
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:17,556
Five dollars won't even cover
the interest you're accruing.

70
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:19,308
What's the interest rate
on your credit card?

71
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,759
Don't know,
but my interest rate

72
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,011
in the conversation is zero.

73
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:25,263
Max, how could you
not know that?

74
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:26,481
That's one of the first things

75
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:27,966
my father taught me
about finance.

76
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:30,736
Where...
at Embezzle U.?

77
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,242
Max, I interned
at Merrill Lynch.

78
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:40,078
Let me help you with this.
It's the least I can do.

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,197
I had nowhere to go.
You took me in.

80
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,750
Let me repay my debt to you
by helping with your debt

81
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:47,536
to everyone in the world,
apparently.

82
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:48,704
If you keep talking,

83
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:51,039
<i>I'm going to
Merrill Lynch myself.</i>

84
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,791
I'm one of those people

85
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:55,711
who gets off on untangling
big, complicated messes.

86
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,462
And since you won't let me
do your hair,

87
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:00,298
let me do your bills.

88
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,469
You want to do my bills?

89
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:13,095
Here's my portfolio.

90
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:17,616
And, uh, if you find
chocolate sprinkles in there,

91
00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:18,984
they're not chocolate...

92
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:21,103
Or sprinkles.

93
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:27,542
Okay.

94
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:29,861
I've divided your bills
into three categories...

95
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:32,464
"impossible,"
"next to impossible,"

96
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:36,051
and "how the hell
did that happen?"

97
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:38,587
And I've divided my roommate
into three categories...

98
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:40,472
"annoying,"
"super annoying,"

99
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:43,759
and "how the hell
did that happen?"

100
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,561
I'm closing kitchen
in ten minutes.

101
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:48,397
I cannot stay later.

102
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,715
I have date with new woman
in my life.

103
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:52,517
She's very special to me.

104
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,403
I think she may be the one.

105
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:58,407
You are both welcome
to come watch us have sex.

106
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,908
Just putting it out there.

107
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,860
Just put it back in there.

108
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:06,531
I'm so excited, I don't even
know where to start.

109
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,200
Drumroll, please.

110
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:10,585
No?
Okay.

111
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:12,204
Oh, interesting.

112
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:13,922
Here we have a bill
from the pet castle,

113
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:17,092
yet you don't have a pet, and
you've never been to a castle...

114
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:19,711
Oh, except white castle.

115
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:21,263
You used a credit card
at white castle?

116
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:24,415
Yep.
That was good weed.

117
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:26,351
And the pet thing was
'cause I found a stray

118
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:27,436
and had to have her
cleaned up

119
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:28,887
before I could get anyone
to take her.

120
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,889
That would also explain
the charge for neutering.

121
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:32,691
Nah, actually,
that was for me.

122
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:34,943
Can't have any more
of these coming out.

123
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:36,594
Do you really think

124
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:38,763
it's fiscally smart
to be taking in strays?

125
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:41,933
Good point.
Move out tonight.

126
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:44,102
What is this...
a student loan?

127
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:47,789
Oh, my God.
Max, you went to college?

128
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,825
That wasn't a judgment.
It was just shocking...

129
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:54,713
kind of like seeing
a baby smoke on the Internet.

130
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:58,116
I love that kid.

131
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:02,637
Max, a student loan is
the worst bill you can ignore.

132
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,339
It can never be expunged.

133
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,641
We're breaking out "expunged"
on a weeknight?

134
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:08,977
You can't run away
from this bill.

135
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:10,679
I can run away
from anything.

136
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:14,015
I'm on my fifth identity.

137
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:15,984
It's just like that
but underwater!

138
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:16,968
Guys!

139
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,187
Sorry,
we're just closing, guys.

140
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,990
I'll take them, Max.
We need the...

141
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:27,445
uh, sit anywhere.

142
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,334
What was that roadrunner move
you just pulled?

143
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:34,336
There's still a smoke outline
of your body

144
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,654
Hanging in the air
out there.

145
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:39,007
Did Wile E. Coyote
just come in the diner?

146
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,726
- No, but my ex-boyfriend did.

147
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:44,880
Meep, meep.

148
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:48,795
Why is William
in Brooklyn?

149
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,514
Why is William
in this diner?

150
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:53,267
Why is every inbred rich guy
named William?

151
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,854
I don't want to see him.

152
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,157
Max, close the door.

153
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,775
I don't want him
to come in here.

154
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:05,112
Yeah, 'cause that happens
all the time.

155
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:06,664
Customers come
in the front door

156
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,165
and make a beeline
through the kitchen

157
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:13,153
to see if there's a waitress
hiding in the walk-in freezer.

158
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,338
Okay, what is the deal?

159
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,589
Tell me fast.

160
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,659
I'm nipping
like crazy in here.

161
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:22,829
Ooh, you're smuggling some
gumdrops there, too, ice queen.

162
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:25,216
His name is William Van Horn,
and he's...

163
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:28,903
I am leaving for sex.

164
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:32,473
Last chance for threesome,
foursome, possibly fivesome,

165
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:36,260
if her sister's train
gets in on time.

166
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:37,444
Oleg, please.

167
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:39,196
I don't have time
to be harassed right now.

168
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:40,297
Oh, okay.

169
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,400
I'll see you
and the gumdrops tomorrow.

170
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:46,453
Story. Go.

171
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:48,239
We met
at our parents' companies'

172
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,373
parent company picnic.

173
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,958
His family is
the Boston Van Horns...

174
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,042
story.
Stop.

175
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:53,244
Cut to the end.
Do we hate him?

176
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:55,529
He dumped me
when I lost all my money...

177
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,665
never called me,
not an email, nothing.

178
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,166
Oh, we hate him.

179
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:01,418
Wait. Which one's your ex...
the Asian one, the black one?

180
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,971
I'm kidding.
No, seriously.

181
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:09,643
The white one or the really,
really white one?

182
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:13,931
Really, really white.

183
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:16,817
Service, service, service,

184
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,436
service, service, serv...

185
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:21,188
you heard your bro.
Service him.

186
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,741
Oh, crushed!

187
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,276
Hey, you better be careful,

188
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:27,027
'cause I can give you a run
for your money.

189
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,329
I don't have any money.

190
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,247
Well, with a body like that,
you don't need any.

191
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,616
- Oh! Ba-bam!

192
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:34,501
Did you actually think
that was a good line,

193
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:35,502
or is that what you do

194
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:37,371
so the check gets paid
by Richie Rich?

195
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,089
Hold on.
Who said I was rich?

196
00:08:39,091 --> 00:08:40,841
- Let me see your Hands.
- What...

197
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:43,127
looking to see if I have
poor-people calluses?

198
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,647
No, I wanted to see
how big your penis is.

199
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,684
With Hands that size,
you better be rich.

200
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:53,804
Oh! Shazam!

201
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,440
Not cool, bro.

202
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,642
- What's your name?
- Michelle Obama.

203
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:00,778
We're closed.

204
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,430
I'm William.
Give me your number.

205
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:05,449
Why? So you can put it
in your phone

206
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:07,534
and never call or text
or email?

207
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:09,036
Seriously.

208
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:11,238
You wouldn't know what to do
with a good girl if you had one.

209
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,907
But you're not a good girl.
That's why I want your number.

210
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:15,659
So how about it?

211
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:17,277
We're closed.

212
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,996
- Your sign says
"open till 2:00."

213
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:30,841
My, my.

214
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:33,894
How time does fly.

215
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:40,100
2:00, gentlemen...
nighty night.

216
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:44,888
What did I ever do to you?

217
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,327
You didn't mention me,
did you?

218
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,795
Ugh, no.
I just gave him...

219
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:53,530
just get to the end.
Do you hate him?

220
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:54,948
I hate him.

221
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,283
That was
the weirdest thing,

222
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:58,435
seeing him come in here.

223
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:02,256
No, the weirdest thing
is coming in here right now.

224
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,126
Why no?

225
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:09,513
Girl at urban outfitter said
it was hip.

226
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:11,048
You look like a lesbian

227
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,051
I made out with once
on a dare.

228
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:20,023
Han, you're adorable
exactly as you are.

229
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:22,976
Why are you trying
to be hip?

230
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:24,895
To meet girls.

231
00:10:24,897 --> 00:10:28,615
Oh!

232
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,170
It's not that bad in here.

233
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:34,805
I thought my first trip
to a laundromat

234
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:36,824
would be
a lot more depressing.

235
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:52,222
Six years
we spent together,

236
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:54,975
and now he won't even look
at me.

237
00:10:57,712 --> 00:10:59,346
Oh, not the bag.

238
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:02,433
I just looked at his bag...
now yours?

239
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:04,151
Max, it's driving me crazy.

240
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:06,186
What did you major in
in college?

241
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:07,855
I majored
in changing topics.

242
00:11:07,857 --> 00:11:09,573
So what did you ever see
in your ex,

243
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:11,859
the lost Winklevoss twin?

244
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:13,894
We're not talking
about William.

245
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:15,562
We're talking
about your bills.

246
00:11:15,564 --> 00:11:17,114
Well, I'm talking
about your Bill!

247
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,716
Oh, face!
Max...

248
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:21,368
We're trying to start
a cupcake business.

249
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,537
And I can't believe
I'm about to say this

250
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,923
but with my father's
financial baggage,

251
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,624
you're our best chance
for credit.

252
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:30,076
Listen, everybody's broke
in their 20s.

253
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:31,879
And everybody hides
from stuff.

254
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,130
You run into freezers.

255
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:35,632
I practice ignorance
and blackout drinking.

256
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:42,422
What's happening right now?

257
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:45,392
<i>Hola, dudarinos.</i>

258
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:47,561
The laundromat's
closing early.

259
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:51,315
We've rented it out
for our '80s pop-up disco party.

260
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:54,267
Bobby.

261
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:57,070
- Shouldn't it be called
an "'80s pop-up lame hipster

262
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:59,957
will do anything
to be ironic and lame" party?

263
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,074
"Lame"?

264
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:02,943
Don't think so.

265
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:04,378
What?

266
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,129
<i>Vicki from small wonder
is coming?</i>

267
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh!

268
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:09,416
Embarrassed to be you
right now.

269
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:13,387
Unless you chicks have
75 disco-lovin' bucks,

270
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,088
be gone in ten minutes,

271
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,307
or my man here
will throw you out.

272
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,510
Don't let his tube top
fool you.

273
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:22,563
Bobby is mad wiry.

274
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:24,097
I'm wiry.

275
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,136
<i>Small wonder?</i>

276
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:31,989
Is that the show on TLC

277
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:34,024
about the little-people
magicians?

278
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:35,475
No.

279
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:38,245
It's an '80s sitcom
about this little girl robot

280
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,980
who lives
with a loving family.

281
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:41,582
A girl robot?

282
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,200
That's totally unbelievable.

283
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:45,619
No,
that's totally awesome!

284
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:49,006
The unbelievable part
is the loving family.

285
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:50,340
I love Vicki.

286
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:52,376
She had no
emotions and was empty inside.

287
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:54,378
My role model! We're staying.

288
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,997
$75?
To do what...

289
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,832
stand here
and dance next to...

290
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,552
Guy-girl and girl-guy
over there?

291
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:07,608
Come on, Chestnut,

292
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,176
go poo-poo
near the hipsters.

293
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:11,228
Hey, how cool would it be
if we could get

294
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,363
<i>Chess to go poo
on a hipster?</i>

295
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:15,115
How can
all of those people

296
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:18,902
have $75 just to dance
at a laundromat?

297
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:20,537
I've been doing my roots
with white-out.

298
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:23,457
Hipsters in Williamsburg
will pay for anything

299
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,742
if it makes them feel like
they're in on something new

300
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,160
no one else knows about.

301
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:28,629
All you need's a gimmick.

302
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:29,746
Dudes!

303
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,281
Can we ride your horse?

304
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:32,883
Sure.
100 bucks.

305
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,835
Okay.
I got to go to the ATM.

306
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:37,888
Wait. Stay right there.
We'll be right back.

307
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,256
Oh, my God.

308
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:41,875
Max, we are literally looking
our gift horse in the mouth.

309
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:44,511
We have something that's better
than an '80s disco party.

310
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:45,395
We have a horse.

311
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:47,147
If we throw
a big enough party,

312
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:48,815
charge hipsters
for horse rides,

313
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,567
we could pay off
your student loan!

314
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,569
You'd whore out Chestnut
like that?

315
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,521
Don't you have to get him
hooked on heroin first?

316
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:56,189
Max, I've got this.

317
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:57,908
I'm a brilliant event planner.

318
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,277
My sweet 16
was off the chain...

319
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,329
penthouse party,
pink and black theme.

320
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:05,165
<i>Alanis Morissette sang songs
from jagged little pill.</i>

321
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,617
On my 16th birthday,

322
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:08,735
my mom took too many
jagged little pills,

323
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:10,370
and I had to drive her
to the emergency room

324
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:11,955
to get her stomach pumped.

325
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:15,709
<i>Was your childhood based
on the novel Push by Sapphire?</i>

326
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:18,178
I wish!

327
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:22,716
The theme is
'90s horse party.

328
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,384
It's exactly the kind
of hip event

329
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:25,602
you're dying to be a part of.

330
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:27,054
It would happen
after closing,

331
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:28,355
so it won't affect business.

332
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:29,890
And all the horse rides
will take place out back.

333
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:32,109
So no damage will come
to the diner.

334
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,761
But why would I say yes
to giving up my diner

335
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:36,363
for no cash return?

336
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:38,231
You might get laid.

337
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,621
Great!

338
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,957
The '90s horse party
is happening on Thursday.

339
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,742
Fantastic.
Any other questions?

340
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:49,743
Yes.

341
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:51,745
What exactly is possibility

342
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:54,614
of percentage of me...

343
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:56,133
Getting laid?

344
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,886
All I can say is,

345
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:02,139
with the cute
'90s-themed-clothing incentive

346
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:03,623
and the trivia contest,

347
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,560
lots of cute hipster girls
will be here looking to...

348
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,395
Get laid!

349
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:11,431
I will go now
and start to research

350
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:14,467
American trivia facts
about the 1990s.

351
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:18,471
You realize we're gonna have
to give him something...

352
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:19,990
like flash a little boob,
something.

353
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,526
I feel like Han's
more of an ass man.

354
00:15:22,528 --> 00:15:25,478
Good point... 'cause his head
is right there.

355
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:32,485
♪ Creep ♪

356
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:35,488
♪ oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I,
yeah ♪

357
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,907
♪ creep,
oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I ♪

358
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,125
Oleg, what's up?

359
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:40,877
Not enjoying
the '90s horse party?

360
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,663
I thought you said
"'90s whores party."

361
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:50,436
Now I'm wearing girdle
and deodorant for no reason.

362
00:15:52,356 --> 00:15:53,723
Quite a turnout, Max.

363
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:56,526
Reminds me of the after-hours
clubs I used to go to,

364
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:58,811
you know, if all
the cool cats shooting dope

365
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:02,348
were replaced by sad,
white fools sipping light beer.

366
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:06,018
Look!

367
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,405
I did research and make myself
a 1990s trivia t-shirt.

368
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,741
"Talk to the Han."

369
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:12,909
Get it?

370
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:15,128
"Talk to the Han!"

371
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:19,048
That actually is cool.

372
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,251
I am hoping
it will help me...

373
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,669
Get laid?

374
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:28,624
Care to purchase
a tamagotchi

375
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,210
or a 90210-reo cupcake?

376
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:35,014
We came here wanting
to hate on you chicks hard.

377
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:39,735
But that horse you got
out back is mad cool.

378
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,437
You bested us,
party beast.

379
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:45,158
And to that,
I doff my cap.

380
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:48,727
- How much are the cupcakes?
- $10 each.

381
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:52,865
Ooh, I doff my cap again,
milady.

382
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,900
Max, look at all this.

383
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,169
We're a success!

384
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,753
I'll tell you
what's not a success...

385
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,505
the plan to get Han
some action.

386
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:01,207
Look at him over there.

387
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,882
- That's so sad.
- I know.

388
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,718
Go over there
and give him a "Han" job.

389
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:19,025
William!

390
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:22,028
Meep, meep.

391
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:31,704
You realize this is a freezer,
not a panic room, right?

392
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:32,938
Just go out there

393
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,274
and tear his smug, white ass
a new one.

394
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:36,626
I can't face him, Max.

395
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:39,278
Why? He's the one
who didn't call you.

396
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,947
I can't face him
because I'm a waitress.

397
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:42,915
Last time he saw me,

398
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,800
I was a billionaire
in a townhouse.

399
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:47,587
Now I'm a waitress
in a walk-in freezer.

400
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:50,423
So, when you were laying
around on your trust fund,

401
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:51,424
doing nothing every day,

402
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:53,176
having other people
scrub your toilet,

403
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:54,627
you could hold your head
up high?

404
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:55,961
But now
that you support yourself

405
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:58,231
by earning your own money,
that's somehow shameful?

406
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,565
Who cares what he thinks?

407
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:04,237
He is the guy who just paid $100
to party with a horse.

408
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:07,406
He's the loser, not you.

409
00:18:07,408 --> 00:18:09,358
Really? 'Cause he's
out there having fun,

410
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,359
and I'm in here,

411
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:13,746
hugging a tub
of expired blue cheese.

412
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:15,981
Look...

413
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:18,201
You see that wad
of cash in your Hand?

414
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:20,203
You earned that.

415
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,121
Slap that wad in your palm
a few times!

416
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:23,589
Feel its power.

417
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,093
That's all you got?

418
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:29,212
Come on,
really squeeze that wad!

419
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:30,663
Feels good
in your Hands, right?

420
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:32,831
- Feels pretty good.
- Yeah.

421
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,102
Now slap it and say,
"this is my wad!"

422
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,638
This is my wad.

423
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,390
<i>This is my wad!</i>

424
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:43,842
<i>This is my wad!</i>

425
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:45,144
Go out there.

426
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,797
I'm going out there!

427
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,815
As soon as the ladies
calm down.

428
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:51,117
Are you kidding?

429
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,203
Show him what he's missing.
Let 'em pop, playa!

430
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,575
Where are you,
you rich poseur?

431
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:01,077
Oh! Uh...

432
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,411
Listen up!

433
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:05,881
That was meant exclusively
for one specific rich poseur.

434
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,200
All you other rich poseurs,

435
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:09,719
just continue
with the '90s!

436
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,804
Whoop, whoop!

437
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:14,056
Where is he?
Do you see him?

438
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:16,259
Uh, no.
He was right over there.

439
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,677
He's gone.

440
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,595
I don't get to shove this
in his face.

441
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:21,364
It would've been nice
to put my wad

442
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:24,850
in his face
for a change.

443
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:33,276
Oh, speaking of wads,
look over there.

444
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:37,229
Aw.

445
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:39,915
He's such a little pimp.

446
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,001
Are you okay?

447
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,003
Yeah.
Actually, I am.

448
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:45,454
I guess I didn't need
to go over there

449
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:46,905
and make some big,
dramatic speech,

450
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,708
telling him
that even though I'm a waitress,

451
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,908
I'm better than him.

452
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,762
I know that now.
Thank you.

453
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:55,464
And when I see him
one day in the future,

454
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:58,584
I'll be happy
to tell him that.

455
00:19:58,586 --> 00:20:00,052
He just came
out of the men's room.

456
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:01,220
Let's get out of here!

457
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:02,471
What? I thought
you wanted to talk to him!

458
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:04,440
I said, "the future."
This is the '90s.

459
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:07,643
Let's get out of here.
Run!

460
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,032
Feels good running away
from your bill, huh?

461
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:14,283
So great.

462
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:15,951
See, that's what
I've been saying.

463
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,737
Well, at least
you don't have to run

464
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:19,155
from your student loan bill.

465
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:21,957
We can pay that off and still
have $50 for the cupcake fund.

466
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,576
I hate that college won.

467
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:25,494
Didn't you get anything
out of it?

468
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:27,546
You mean, besides mono
and an art teacher

469
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:28,881
whose idea
of finger-painting

470
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:32,385
was a little more "finger"
than "painting"?

471
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:33,419
Art teacher?

472
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,788
Max, was that your major... art?

473
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,841
Keep your eyes on the road.
You're driving.

474
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,176
I just thought
for, like, a second,

475
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:43,312
I could maybe illustrate
children's books.

476
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:45,964
Max, that's so sweet.

477
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:48,684
You're not like Vicki at all.

478
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:51,020
Max, look.
Han!

479
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:52,988
Aw, our little
somethin'-somethin'

480
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,074
got him a little
somethin'-somethin'!

481
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,777
I doff my cap, milady!
