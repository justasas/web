Some mothers tend to breast-feed
for a lot longer these days.

00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:10,006
It's called attachment parenting.

4
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:14,006
When the kid is that big,
it's called dating.

00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:19,006
I mean, he's gotta come up
for air at some point.

00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,276
No, he doesn't.

00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:24,011
Isn't he too old
to drink from the teat?

I've lived too long.

00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,326
I'm ready to order.

00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:43,564
I can't. I mean, I respect
it all, but I'll throw up.

I'll go.
I can't afford HBO,

Hi, what can I get you?

He's obviously good drink-wise.

17

I'll have tea
and a turkey club.

from my hands,

some kind of hiding game.

122
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:43,862

we'll be playing a different game

123

of Han I cut off."

124
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:52,371
Yeah, that's right.
You better walk away.

you to just sit here and casually flip

everything I love from my old life.

130
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,487

insensitive and stuff.

131
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:10,622

It's all getting
a little tense.

142

Plink.

144
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,468
Wow, this prison's
a lot better than the last one.

145
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,903
It's more like a country club.

146
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,938
I mean, I think I saw a list
for mixed doubles

147
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,273
where we signed in.

148
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,275
Max, I know your idea
of a country club's

149
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,910
an abandoned car in the woods,

150
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:06,445
but look around.

151
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,981
There's security cameras
and bars on the windows.

152
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:10,816
All right,
so it's a rough country club,

153
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:14,786
where the strongest golfers
make the caddies their bitch.

154
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:16,321
Max, my father's in prison.

155
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:18,524
Be more sensitive and stuff.

156
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:21,126
Look, I get it.
You're protective.

157
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:22,728
He's your father
and you love him,

158
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,466
but I'm sorry,
not everybody feels that way.

159
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:28,901
- Daddy.
- There she is.

160
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:30,769
Aww, uhh!

161
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,804
How's my little girl?
I'm great, Daddy.

162
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:34,706
- Yeah.
- I like the new uniform,

163
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,508
and it isn't
at all prison-y.

164
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,776
Yeah. I don't know
what's worse:

165
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:42,548
Being locked up or looking like
you work at a banana republic.

166
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,450
Now, wait a minute.
This can't be Max.

167
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:46,952
The stories I've heard,
I was expecting more

168
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:50,289
of a truck driver.

169
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,990
Hey, Brian, you might wanna look
the other way.

170
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,226
I think Max is here
to break me out.

171
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:55,260
Isn't that right, Max?

172

00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,800
[Laughter]

175
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:04,570
Okay, fine,
your dad is awesome.

176
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:13,400
Well, our projected
cupcake business growth ratio

177
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:15,502
isn't where I want it to be,
but with autumn here,

178
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:16,903
we have a lot of hope
in the launch

179
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:18,571
of our new pumpkin spice flavor.

180
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,974
Honey, I love you very much,

181
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,108
but we're almost out of time,

182
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,345
and I can't talk any more
about cupcakes.

183
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,280
Just wanted to pick your brain.

184
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:29,215
Now, Max, I asked you
to meet me here today

185
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,617
because I wanna ask you
a favor.

186
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,252
You want me
to smuggle something in?

187
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,221
Something out?
I'm good either way.

188
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,524
I want you to take Caroline
to the estate auction.

189
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:38,792
Daddy, no.

190
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,293
Why would I put myself
through that?

191
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,195
Why would I ever go
where everybody knows who I am

192
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,530
and be publicly humiliated?

193
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:44,998
I know it will be hard for you,

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,533
but I promise
it'll be worth it.

195
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:48,134
There's one thing
at that auction

196
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,403
that I really care about
that I want you to have.

197
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,571
What?

198
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,273
The painting of me as a baby?

199
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:54,974
The sculpture of me
as a five-year-old?

200
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,377
[Gasps] The tapestry
of me at 14?

201
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,181
I have a pretty good
police sketch of me at seven.

202
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,849
I want you two to go there

203
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,952
and get the loving cup you won
jumping with Chestnut.

204
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:07,854
I know how much
that meant to you.

205
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:10,190
Even if I could bring myself
to go through all that,

206
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:13,593
we need every penny we have
for the cupcake business.

207
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:14,828
Tell him, Max.

208
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,198
Martin, you know
I'd do anything for you.

209
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,633
Anything.

210
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:21,835
But it's true.
We're broke.

211
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:23,937
- Time is up.
- Seriously, Daddy,

212
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:28,074
I use the box
our soap comes in as a wallet.

213
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:31,744
Man, that is hard to hear.

214
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:35,415
Max, you're my girl, right?

215
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,550
Am I?

216
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:39,552
I want you to find a way
to get that cup.

217
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:43,890
No matter what she says,
make sure she gets that cup.

218
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:44,991
You follow me?

219
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:46,693
You want me to follow you?

220
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:48,695
Can I even go back there?

221
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,330
No, you can't, miss.

222
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:53,766
Oh, follow you,
like follow your thought.

223
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:55,001
It's important for her,

224
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,903
and it's important
for the both of you

225
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59,305
for your futures, all right?

226
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,108
Get the cup.
What are you getting?

227
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,779
The cup, Martin?

228
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:07,881
I love you, sweetheart.

229
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:09,215
Love you too, Daddy.

230
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:12,252
And don't worry:
We'll get that cup.

231
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:13,786
I'm not getting that cup.

232
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:16,356
What? Then why did you say
you would?

233
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:18,091
You can't tell
a man in prison "no."

234
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:19,792
He'll hang himself
with his belt.

235
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:21,661
It happened
to you twice already.

236
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,229
We have to go get that cup.

237
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:25,465
Why?

238
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:28,668
There's money in the cup.

239
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,069
What are you talking about?

240
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:32,138
He said we needed it
for our future,

241
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,773
then he winked.

242
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,508
It was either that,
or he was hitting on me,

243
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,911
which, I'm not gonna lie,
I wouldn't hate.

244
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:40,880
How would he even hide money
in a cup, Nancy Drew?

245
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:43,116
Well, what does a loving cup
look like?

246
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,150
Is it like a bowling trophy?

247
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:46,519
How dare you.

248
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,756
Does it have, like,
a wood base?

249
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:53,192
Yup, I used to hide my stash
in my mother's bowling trophy,

250
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,094
and you're telling me the man
who invented a way

251
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:57,297
to defraud most of New York
isn't as clever

252
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,466
as a stoned 12-year-old
with a butter knife?

253
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:02,569
Well, it was weird
how it was all about the cup

254
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,370
and so little
about the pumpkin spice cupcake.

255
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,672
Right?

256
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,173
And you don't think your father

257
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:09,542
who spent a fortune
to turn you into a sculpture,

258
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,078
presumably nude, wouldn't try
to figure out a way

259
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,314
to take care
of his only daughter?

260
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:16,115
The man's a criminal genius,

261
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:19,319
and he found a way to put money
for your future in the cup,

262
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,354
and clearly,
that's why he dragged me

263
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,723
out to prison, because he knows
you'll do what I say

264
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,325
'cause I'm the boss of you,
and pretty soon

265
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:28,261
I'm gonna be your stepmom.

266
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:31,331
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
I hear what you're saying,

267
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,066
but I just
have one big question.

268
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,400
How much are we willing to bid?

269
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,736
No, about my disguise.

270
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,739
I know I'm a brunette,
but do I have bangs?

271
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,778
Actually, I need two:
One for me,

272
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,483
and one for my friend
Zooey Deschanel.

273
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:53,152
What? You look like her.
Everybody does.

274
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:57,390
It's the least expensive look
you can do and still get laid.

275
00:11:57,392 --> 00:12:00,893
God, this is from storage.
I haven't seen it in years.

276
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,128
Wow, you had all these closets,

277
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,331
and no one in your family
is gay?

278
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,135
Look! It's the Louie the XVI
I used to have in my playroom.

279
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:11,437
My cousin Peter and I
used to climb in here

280
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,406
and play French Revolution.

281
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:14,907
I'd be Marie Antoinette,
and he'd help me

282
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,676
put my hair up
in a high chignon.

283
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:22,181
[Gasps] Oh, now I'm feeling bad
for his wife.

284
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:23,716
So where do you think
the cup is?

285
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:25,985
Let's look over there.

286
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:29,155
[Gasps] Oh, this is
from the summer house.

287
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:31,224
Max, you know the expression

288
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:34,160
"born with a silver spoon
in your mouth"?

289
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:36,162
This is mine.

290
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:37,830
Miss, do not handle that.

291
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:39,632
I'm asking you
to put it down right now.

292
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,868
Hey, you might
wanna relax the attitude.

293
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,672
You really think my friend
Jennifer Love Hewitt,

294
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:48,141
international movie
and Lifetime channel superstar,

295
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,609
is gonna steal a used spoon?

296
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:53,079
[Chuckles]
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

297
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:55,448
Now I see it.
[Chuckles]

298
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,316
I thought
I was Zooey Deschanel.

299
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,451
Eh, six of one.

300
00:12:58,453 --> 00:12:59,752
All you Hollywood brunettes
look alike.

301
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:01,187
[Tones]

302
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:04,123
The auction is starting,
ladies and gentlemen.

303
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,458
Hi, Max.

304
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,561
[Chuckles] I'm so excited
to be here.

305
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,563
Oh, hello, Caroline.

306
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:13,099
Sophie, I apologize
for the other day.

307
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:15,635
I was really tense,
and I didn't mean it.

308
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:17,437
I think you have
a unique sense of style.

309
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,940
You do so much
with so little fabric.

310
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:24,310
I do...

311
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:29,716
And I see you took my advice
and got Polish <i>Vogue.</i>

312
00:13:29,718 --> 00:13:31,050
How nice is this?

313
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,086
We are finally
on a romantic date.

314
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,254
We just came from lunch
at Rainbow Room,

315
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:38,858
and I'm wearing
my best Fila tracksuit.

316
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,328
Yah, now, he's going
to buy me something golden.

317
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,897
Yah, I want
to be covered in gold.

318
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:47,734
I want a golden shower.

319
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,039
Let's see.
If I was a loving cup,

320
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,373
where would I be?

321
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,276
Some place with a lot of cash
shoved up inside you.

322
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,911
How much do you think
is in there?

323
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:00,279
Well, let's see.
The wooden base of the cup

324
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,715
is about this big,
and I know you can get 20,000

325
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,350
in an Altoids tin,

326
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:06,319
and this is about three times
that size,

327
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,721
so 60,000.

328
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,825
$60,000?

329
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:16,062
That's like a million dollars!

330
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,831
So I could have $60,000
in an hour?

331
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,168
Well, we.
We could have it.

332
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,470
Did I say I?
How weird.

333
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,281
And sold.

334
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:34,549
Wow, you're getting everything.

335
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:36,551
Yes, we are.

336
00:14:36,553 --> 00:14:38,820
Aren't we, Miss Pickle?

337
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:40,488
I'm Hamish McDonough,
by the way.

338
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,727
Oh, I'm Max, and this
is my friend Katie Holmes.

339
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:49,197
We won't speak of it...

340
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,202
But I just have to say:
Well done!

341
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:57,539
And if you ever need anything,
don't hesitate.

342
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,808
Oh, you have your own shop?

343
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,743
"Just The Two Of Us" antiques.

344
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:03,978
Is that you and Miss Pickle?

345
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,450
No, dear, I'm not insane.

346
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:09,884
Next item for auction:

347
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:13,521
A 19th century ivory and gold
bedside table,

348
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:16,391
Oh! [Moans]

349
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:19,694
Oh, say it again.

350
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:23,531
This is highly unorthodox,
but I shall repeat the item.

351
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:26,101
A 19th century gold and ivory
bedside table--

352
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:30,071
[Moans]

353
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,740
I'm a very lucky man, yes?

354
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,776
We start the opening bid
on this item

355
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:37,178
at $50,000.

356
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,514
I'm out.

357
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:41,716
- 50,000.
- Here.

358
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:43,017
Do I hear 60,000?

359
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,853
- 60,000!
- 60,000 over here.

360
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:46,254
Do I hear 70,000?

361
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,256
70,000.
Do I hear 80,000?

362
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:50,592
Yes, you do!

363
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:54,295
80,000 going once, going twice,

364
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:55,663
sold.
[Laughs]

365
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,098
Hamish, you killed it.

366
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,367
Yolo!

367
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:02,937
And the next item up for bid

368
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,106
is a silver-plated
tin loving cup,

369
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:07,675
property of Caroline Channing.

370
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:09,043
How much do you think
this is going to go for?

371
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:12,413
Kitsch is always a wild card,
but it has no real value.

372
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:14,782
No real value? Please.

373
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:16,718
I won that when no one
thought I could.

374
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,021
I jumped 14 hurdles in the rain
with walking pneumonia.

375
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:21,456
It's worth something.

376
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,658
Yeah, 'cause it has money
in it.

377
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,760
We start the bidding at $50.

378
00:16:25,762 --> 00:16:27,295
50.

379
00:16:27,297 --> 00:16:29,998
51.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,101
Sir, it's in increments of $10.

381
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:35,703
Then, I'm out.

382
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:38,339
Sorry, the Rainbow Room
really sucked me dry.

383
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:42,577
Hm, guess what else
is pretty dry right now?

384
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,512
Do I hear 60?

385
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:46,414
60.

386
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,516
What are you doing?
You said it had no real value.

387
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:50,285
I know, but wouldn't it be camp

388
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,387
to see Miss Pickle
taking a bath in that

389
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:53,955
for my Christmas card?

390
00:16:53,957 --> 00:16:55,924
Do I hear 70?

391
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,659
My cup is not a puppy bath.

392
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:59,928
- 70.
- 80.

393
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,830
Back out now, ladies.
I'm a paddle bitch.

394
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:04,999
Well, I'm a bitch bitch.
100.

395
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,368
- 125.
- 150.

396
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,238
- 175.
- Hamish came to play.

397
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,175
So did we, I broke my hymen
getting that thing.

398
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:16,611
Is that why it's called
a loving cup?

399
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:18,680
- 200.
- I have 200.

400
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:20,048
Do I hear 225?

401
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,316
Look, Hamish.

402
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:23,218
I know you have no interest
in what I would normally

403
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,652
offer you to get what I want.

404
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:28,289
Don't be so sure.
I was bisexual till I was 62.

405
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,359
Look, Katie Holmes
really wants this,

406
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:32,827
and she's been through a lot.

407
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:35,830
True. It's yours.
I'm out.

408
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:38,366
200 going once, going twice.

409
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:41,002
- Sold.
- Yes, I'm rich!

410
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:45,206
Did you just say "I'm"?

411
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,643
I think
you're hearing me wrong.

412
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,712
Okay, before we use
all this money on the business,

413
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:52,714
we should take a vacation.
How 'bout it?

414
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:55,416
You, me, Chestnut, jet skis.

415
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:57,452
Okay, here we go.

416
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:58,620
No, no, no.
Don't open it now.

417
00:17:58,622 --> 00:17:59,887
There are cameras here.

418
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:01,122
We can just go over there
and open it

419
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,257
right next to that thing
where you

420
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,359
and your little queen cousin
played dress-up.

421
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:06,394
Seriously, how could I not
have known that?

422
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:07,895
When we played
Cowboys and Indians,

423
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:11,065
he played
the Indian's makeup artist.

424
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,734
I have to say, Max,
it'll be nice

425
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:14,802
to have some money again,
but what's really nice

426
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:16,738
is that now you see
who my father is,

427
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,873
a man who,
despite all of his flaws,

428
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,241
never stopped thinking
about what he could do

429
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:22,310
to take care
of his little girl.

430
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:29,550
It's empty?

431
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:33,221
Son of a bitch.

432
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:37,992
Martin, we just
have one question.

433
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:40,762
Where's the money?

434
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,730
I'm sorry, what?

435
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:46,534
Where's... The money?

436
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:48,202
[Laughs]
What?

437
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:50,438
She's asking
where the money is.

438
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,507
Oh! Uh, what money?

439
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,075
The money in the cup, Daddy.

440
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:55,910
The money you hid in the cup
that was supposed to be

441
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:57,979
for my future?
Where's my 60 grand?

442
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,415
Which, for anyone
who might be watching my lips,

443
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:03,117
we were going
to give all to charity.

444
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,620
Sweetheart, why do you
think I would hide money,

445
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:08,222
besides the fact I'm here
for hiding money?

446
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:10,158
Well, that might
have been my fault.

447
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,759
No, it's not her fault, Daddy.

448
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,161
It's yours.

449
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,363
You were supposed to take care
of me, and you didn't.

450
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,432
You didn't think
about me at all,

451
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,400
and it's not just me.
You hurt a lot of people.

452
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:22,337
Do you ever even think
about them?

453
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:23,738
Yes, I do.

454
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,307
Now, every day,

455
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:27,942
but I also think
about what I did to you

456
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:30,244
every day, all day.

457
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:32,113
I mean, back then,
when I figured out a way

458
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,115
to get free money,
all I could think

459
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:37,919
- about was the money.
- I hear that.

460
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,654
But I really did
wanna give you something

461
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,556
for your future, sweetheart,

462
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:43,725
which is why I asked Max
to make sure

463
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:45,993
that you got that cup.

464
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:49,297
And I know it's only tin,
but it's the most valuable thing

465
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:50,698
I could give you,
because it'll remind you

466
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,335
that no matter
how hard the circumstances,

467
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:57,672
you could get over any hurdle,

468
00:19:57,674 --> 00:20:02,210
even the ones
I put in front of you.

469
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:03,945
Okay, well, we should go.
Our time's up.

470
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:06,013
Yeah, but--what?
You just got here.

471
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,485
Well, I think I'm done
for today.

472
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:16,257
Boy, I've dreaded the day
you looked at me like this.

473
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:20,061
Now that it's here,
it's even worse.

474
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:21,295
I only hope that one day

475
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:22,930
you could look at me again

476
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:25,867
the way you did
the day you won that cup.

477
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,808
I love you, honey.

478
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,979
I love you too, Daddy.

479
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:39,847
Oh.
[Chuckles] Sorry.

480
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:42,417
You meant her.

481
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,986
See you next week?

482
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:54,529
Wow, having a father is rough.

483
00:20:54,531 --> 00:20:57,231
- Are you okay?
- I will be,

484
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,333
because despite
what everyone else may think,

485
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:01,135
he's not just a thief.
He's my father,

486
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:03,471
and I love him.

487
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,706
Look, if it's any consolation,
I now see

488
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,941
how that could've happened
to him.

489
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,209
I'm not condoning it, but I see

490
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:09,911
how people can get caught up,

491
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:11,679
'cause I am pissed as hell
that next week

492
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:16,050
I won't be riding a horse
who's riding a jet ski.
