<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,180
<i>Episode 41</i>

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,790
Hello?

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,720
I came with the package, but there's no one here.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,750
You brought a package?

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,240
Is it from Sangroksoo Orphanage (Evergreens Orphanage) for sure?

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,050
What's this?

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,400
Why is the package here, when it's addressed to me?

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,780
This was sent from the orphanage.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,340
But, why is this here?

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,380
Who brought it here?

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,140
Oh, taxi!!

13
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,350
Did the ahjumma already take it?

14
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,160
Ahjumma!!

15
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,510
Yes, madam!

16
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,580
Ahjumma! Did you get the package from the mailbox?

17
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,610
No.

18
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,650
The postal package that was for me,

19
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,400
did you not take it out of the mailbox?

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,390
Today, I haven't opened the mailbox.

21
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,200
Oh my,

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,360
How did this photo...

23
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,850
<i> Francesca </i>

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,350
It looks like Mother Superior's diary.

25
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,420
Why did she sent this to me?

26
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,450
But why was this at Sul Joo's house?

27
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,370
What are you trying to say?

28
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,990
I'm pretty sure I left it there.

29
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,920
It's not there. Not there at all.

30
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,020
No matter how much times I check the mailbox, 
 it's not there.

31
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,020
It's not like the package has feet, 
what do you mean it's not there?

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,910
Are you sure?

33
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,250
Did you possibly put it in someone else's mailbox, and got it confused with ours?

34
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,780
I don't have dementia.

35
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,960
I've been to your house for so many years. Would I get confused, and put it in someone else's mailbox?

36
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,790
Where did it disappear to, then?

37
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,720
A ghost is toying with me, seriously.

38
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,450
I specifically placed the package there.

39
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,240
Exactly where did it disappear too?

40
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,510
Okay.

41
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,560
I got it.

42
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,460
Up to where did I read?

43
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,450
Oh. It starts from here.

44
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,830
<i>January 5, 1983.</i>

45
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,820
<i>Sul Joo and Choon Hee came to say hello at the orphanage.</i>

46
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,510
<i>Sister.</i>

47
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,460
<i>You didn't even call.
Girls, what brings you here?</i>

48
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,510
<i>We came to say Happy New Years.</i>

49
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,660
<i>Have you been well, Mother Superior?</i>

50
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,810
<i>When you two were at the orphanage, you two used to stick together like twins.</i>

51
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,740
<i>And now you are even pregnant together</i>

52
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,480
<i>Choon Hee, you have a little more time before the due date, right?</i>

53
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,520
<i>Fifteen more days left.</i>

54
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,120
<i>In a little while, I was going to send you a message anyway.</i>

55
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,660
<i>You don't have anyone to help you postpartum. Why don't you deliver your baby here?</i>

56
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,130
<i>I've already notified the maternity ward members.</i>

57
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,050
<i>Is it really alright?</i>

58
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,110
<i>I wanted to tell her to come to my house, but because of my mother-in-law, I didn't say it.</i>

59
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,150
<i> It's turned out well, Choon Hee! </i>

60
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,780
<i>I... I can't manage this.</i>

61
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,050
<i>How can I raise a child who doesn't have a father?</i>

62
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,080
<i>I... I want to leave this world, and be with Soo Chae.</i>

63
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,730
<i>How can you say those things? The baby in your belly is going to hear you.</i>

64
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,310
<i> Is the baby the problem here? </i>

65
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,760
<i> I feel like I'll go crazy!</i>

66
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,960
<i>God is cruel.</i>

67
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,360
<i>Why was he in such a hurry to take the baby's dad away?</i>

68
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,300
<i>At that time,</i>

69
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,170
<i>only if you didn't stop me...</i>

70
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,930
<i> I have no confidence to raise a child! </i>

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,340
<i> Don't think about anything else, and for the meantime give birth to your child. </i>

72
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,620
<i> Then, I'll figure out everything else. </i>

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,610
<i> Sul Joo, you seem like your baby has been in your stomach longer than expected. </i>

74
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,830
<i>The baby is 10 days overdue. It must have no intention of coming out. </i>

75
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,500
<i>The three of you, please stand side by side. I'll take a picture of you.</i>

76
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,660
<i>My tummy looking like this, why get a picture taken?</i>

77
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,190
<i>All this will be a memory.</i>

78
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,310
<i>Here.</i>

79
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,880
<i> Choon Hee! Smile, okay? </i>

80
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,370
<i> 1, 2, 3! 
 Ah!</i>

81
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,070
My stomach, my stomach is in a lot of pain!

82
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,510
<i> Your water broke! </i>

83
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,750
<i> What should we do? </i>

84
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,490
<i> Wait! Delivery room!</i>

85
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,470
<i>Let's hurry up and take her to the delivery room!</i>

86
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,660
<i> Aiyoo.</i>

87
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,210
<i> Is your stomach also hurting? </i>

88
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,000
<i> Sul Joo! What's wrong? </i>

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,420
<i> I think my baby is coming out! </i>

90
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,610
<i> Ah! </i>

91
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,610
<i>Your mom will be coming home from the hospital shortly.</i>

92
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,420
<i>Let's eat and wait for her, ok?</i>

93
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,070
<i>You're so cute!</i>

94
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,500
<i>What about Choon Hee?</i>

95
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,660
<i>The director called a little while ago.</i>

96
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,370
<i>Fortunately, the bleeding stopped.</i>

97
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,010
<i>She will be released shortly.</i>

98
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,390
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

99
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,380
<i>They said your mom is fine.</i>

100
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,880
<i>We don't have to worry about her, ok?</i>

101
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,900
<i>You're working hard, Sul Joo, instead of Choon Hee.</i>

102
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,990
<i>It's a relief that I can produce a lot of breast milk.</i>

103
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,270
<i> Aiyoo, why is our prince crying? </i>

104
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,500
<i>Should I change his diaper?</i>

105
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,140
woo-ssha-ri (Korean sound made when lifting heavy objects)

106
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,680
<i> Let's see.</i>

107
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,260
<i> His diaper is fine. I wonder why he's crying? </i>

108
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,430
<i> He must be hungry. </i>

109
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,570
<i>Go over there, ok?</i>

110
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,170
Woo-Ssha. 
Tst-tst (clucking tongue to a baby)

111
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,070
<i> Baby, shall we go to the other room?
 Have your diaper changed and then sleep?</i>

112
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,310
<i>Don't leave any seaweed soup.
You have to eat all of it, ok?</i>

113
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,290
<i> Yes, Sister. </i>

114
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,740
<i> Aiyoo, how beautiful. </i>

115
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,650
<i>You must be really hungry.</i>

116
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,850
<i> Aigoo, let's eat! </i>

117
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,240
What is wrong with you?

118
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,760
<i> Baby...baby!!!</i>

119
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,750
<i> Baby? </i>

120
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,150
Baby!

121
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,760
<i> Is no one outside? </i>

122
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,360
<i> Sister! Sister! </i>

123
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,380
<i> Is no one outside?! </i>

124
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,410
<i> Baby!! </i>

125
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,240
<i> Sister! </i>

126
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,260
<i>I'm angry that I have an orphan as my daughter-in-law.</i>

127
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,700
<i>If you end our bloodline on top of that,</i>

128
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,820
<i>I can no longer accept you as my daughter-in-law.</i>

129
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,110
<i>I have no choice, but tell Dong Gyu to have a baby with someone else.</i>

130
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,180
<i> I'm sorry, Baby! </i>

131
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,550
<i> I have no other way. </i>

132
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,080
<i>Hey, baby...</i>

133
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,860
It's not there, Ahjumma?

134
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,030
Yes.

135
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,550
I searched everywhere.

136
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,430
It's not there.

137
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,490
Where on earth did it end up then?

138
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,820
By any chance,

139
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,250
Was there a visitor?

140
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,140
Visitor?

141
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,430
Ah! Your friend that visited you a while ago.

142
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,790
Friend?

143
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,670
That person who you yelled at to get out of the house.

144
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,030
Choon Hee!

145
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,790
Choon Hee..

146
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,010
was here?!?

147
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,760
<i> Sul Joo Unni </i>

148
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,570
<i> There's been a terrible situation, Sister! </i>

149
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,630
<i> Why? </i>

150
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,530
<i> Choon Hee's baby has been... </i>

151
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,980
<i> What's wrong with my baby? </i>

152
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,670
<i> The baby has... </i>

153
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,080
<i> Choon Hee! Are you okay? 
 Ah!</i>

154
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,470
<i> For sure,</i>

155
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,710
<i> I put a purple bracelet around the ankle of Sul Joo's child,</i>

156
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,590
<i> and for Choon Hee's child,</i>

157
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,160
<i> I put a pink bracelet around the ankle.</i>

158
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,320
<i> I put the bracelet around their ankles,</i>

159
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,900
<i> but one day, the bracelets have suddenly switched. </i>

160
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,070
<i>While Choon Hee and I stepped away,</i>

161
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,170
<i>Sul Joo switched her dead son with Choon Hee's son and took him away.</i>

162
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,140
<i>I am sure of it.</i>

163
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,110
<i>Dear God,</i>

164
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,210
<i>what should I do about this situation?</i>

165
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,460
My son...

166
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,060
My son was switched by Sul Joo unni?

167
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,170
Then, Se Yoon..

168
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,340
Se Yoon is my son?

169
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,840
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo...

170
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,030
Mom, are you going out?

171
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,760
Aiyoo, why is your mom acting like that?

172
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,510
Lost half her wits

173
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah.

174
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,460
Her complexion didn't look so good either.

175
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,190
Did something happen?

176
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,260
Aiyoo, this person has been calling me all day!

177
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,130
What is so important about that package that's causing her to act like this?

178
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,600
A package?

179
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,180
What kind of package?

180
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,370
What?

181
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,420
Oh, it's just something.

182
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,410
What now?!

183
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,650
Chae Won's mom?

184
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,620
She just went out a while ago.

185
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,170
Why?

186
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,370
What do you mean they won't sign the contract?

187
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,610
What's happened that made them cancel the contract so suddenly?

188
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,850
Ah, that is...

189
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,510
Is there a certain circumstance?

190
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,220
As Kim Joo Ri was leaving the company,

191
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,670
she went into partnership with our researchers.

192
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,790
They are under a contract with Keum Reung Foods.

193
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,510
She went into partnership with our employees?

194
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,940
Is that true?

195
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,980
Yes, Director.

196
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,580
What about releasing our new product?

197
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,900
I believe it'll be delayed.

198
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,420
They were the team members who were getting the new product ready.

199
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,620
We took away all their researchers related to getting the new product ready.

200
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,670
And we took over the factory.

201
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,850
That bastard, Se Yoon,

202
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,340
must be having a real hard time.

203
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,860
Wait and see.

204
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,330
In the not too distant future, I will gobble up Sunbae's entire company.

205
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:41,620
Aigoo! Our Joo Ri is like her mother so much, her business skills are excellent.

206
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,900
Aigoo, even though I made Cheol Gyoo the president,

207
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,990
he's not good at business.

208
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,320
Ah

209
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,800
Lee Se Yoon has come to see you.

210
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,650
Who?

211
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,960
How are you?

212
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,220
Aigoo... facing the release of your new product, you must be

213
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,860
having a tremendously difficult time since you ran all the way here.

214
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,150
I have come to confirm the truth.

215
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,540
You partnering with our researchers...

216
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,110
You could have just called.
Why did you spend your energy coming here?

217
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,500
It's right that I have done it.

218
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,950
How can you scheme something like this?

219
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,180
What do you mean?!

220
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,330
In a free, democratic country, if you have the capacity, of course you can scout and compete too

221
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,960
How dare you come here to argue over such triviality?

222
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,820
Mom, please!!

223
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,610
I didn't come to pick a fight.

224
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,540
It's because I feel sad for you.

225
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,770
If you start your first step like this,

226
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,170
for the rest of your business life, you will never be able to escape from your temptation of

227
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,420
only walking comfortable and easy path.

228
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,830
What kind of nonsense are you giving as an advice?

229
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,970
We'll live with our own method!

230
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,750
So forget about this and focus on yourself!

231
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,470
President!

232
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,820
Ah! That's enough!

233
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,930
We have nothing to be ashamed of, so

234
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,060
don't talk too much. Hurry up and leave.

235
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,750
Get out! Hurry up!

236
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,920
We've heard enough, so you should leave.

237
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,600
Who may this be?

238
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,760
What business do you have here?

239
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,520
I finished what I have to do, so I should be going.

240
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,110
I'm not sure if you heard from Chae Won.

241
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,130
Not long ago, I got a divorce.

242
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,530
Not sure if you'd be aware of the term "Donl-Sing" (returned to being single)

243
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,010
I didn't say it, so you can make fun of me.

244
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,440
I'm saying this to worry you.

245
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,430
You are not a person that is able to make me worry.

246
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,970
This bastard, it seems like he thinks that words are enough!

247
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,130
We'll find out how things turn out, so don't get overly confident.

248
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,250
According to the information I got, your mother-in-law and your mom,

249
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,570
their relationship is very bad, I heard.

250
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,390
So be on your guard. I'm not dead yet.

251
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,920
Relationship between my mom and Chae Won's mom is not good?

252
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,230
Lee Se Yoon, that bastard, why was he here?

253
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,470
You didn't even come to the directors' meeting. Where have you been all day? And, you just came.

254
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,320
What's the use of having a puppet president around?

255
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,610
You have Joo Ri.

256
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,740
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo.

257
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,500
You, by the way...

258
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,490
Is having the company getting taken away from your younger sister not having any effect on you?

259
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,490
Even without the company matters, I have a lot on my mind.

260
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,550
Aigoo! Aigoo... You're are talking about her again.

261
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,100
Listen carefully!

262
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,600
You're scaring me with your stare.

263
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,040
I'm going to crush Lee Se Yoon with business.

264
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,910
Oppa, you have to take away "Zero", I mean,

265
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,360
Sister-in-law from Lee Se Yoon.

266
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,760
You must! No matter what you have to do, got it?!

267
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,790
Of course.

268
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,510
They say if a woman harbors resentment, it'll snow in May...Scary.

269
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,230
You're scary!

270
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,470
Bo Reum daddy!

271
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,510
You didn't hear from Ki Ok that wench, did you?

272
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,130
Why ask me?

273
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,740
The person who went to fetch her should know.

274
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,930
Just coming back from a fruitless visit.

275
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,490
I knew it.

276
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,810
It's like find a needle in a haystack. How can you catch someone who planned to disappear?

277
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,520
Oh my, goodness..

278
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,190
Uh.

279
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,250
Uhm Ki Ok.

280
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,270
You've gone crazy, haven't you?

281
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,980
Have you no shame?

282
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,330
Father and Mother are inside, right?

283
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,200
And if they are inside?

284
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,530
I will formally introduce them to this person.

285
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,970
Let's go in, Honey.

286
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,690
Honey!?!

287
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,260
These people, really!

288
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,080
Even if you love each other dearly,

289
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,230
are you this dense in understanding your situation?

290
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:54,180
The moment this old gigolo steps over the front door, mother and father will go to hades in fear!

291
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,180
Why are you thinking so extreme, Hyungnim?

292
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,870
Hyungnim?

293
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,710
Why am I your hyungnim?

294
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,500
This fox-like person!!

295
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,960
Let go. Aren't you gonna let go?

296
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,380
Hyungnim, Ahjoomunim! Come out here!

297
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,300
There's been a problem!

298
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,750
Oh my! Oh my! Honey!

299
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,210
You! You!

300
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,440
Let go!

301
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,600
Honey!

302
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,250
What are you doing right now wearing Hangbok (korean traditional clothes)?

303
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,610
They came out here to say hello to Father and Mother.

304
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,660
No way!

305
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,500
Never, definently not!!

306
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,800
Why not!?!

307
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,540
If Father and Mother faint, are you going to take responsibility?!

308
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,750
It's not a kind of problem we can sweep under the rug?

309
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,340
HYUNGNIM!?!

310
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,680
He definitely has a nerve of steel.

311
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,650
Calls any old person Hyung Nim, Hyung Nim.

312
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,120
Aiyoo, this won't do.

313
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,380
If Father and Mother see them, it would be bad!

314
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,440
For now, let's split them up.

315
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,720
Let go!

316
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,330
Aiyoo, what are you doing? Let go!

317
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,070
Th-those people! Stop! Stop!

318
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,030
Stop!

319
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,390
Where do you think...

320
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,870
Let go of me! Are you not going to let go?

321
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,840
What should we do about this old gigolo?

322
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,680
Since he comes at us like a bulldozer, I'm hard pressed to come up with countermeasure.

323
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,450
Aigoo, what brings Teacher Kang here?

324
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,210
Mom.

325
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,300
You even wore Hangbok!

326
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,850
For all these times, hello, Moth-

327
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,370



328
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,310
Come inside!

329
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,300
Aiyoo, I said come inside!

330
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,830
Ah, seriously.

331
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,940
Auntie!

332
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,340
Are you not embarrassed to look at your niece?

333
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,090
Chae Won! Do you think your aunt is embarrassing?

334
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,570
No.

335
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,980
Aghassi, aren't you crazy?

336
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,380
I mean, without permission from parents and siblings, you register marriage and honeymoon

337
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,820
can you act without a care like this?

338
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,550
Then what should I do!

339
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,250
If I were to wait, there's no guarantee it'd be in 1000 or 10,000 years

340
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,710
If you leave without visiting after having come all this way, I'd be sad.

341
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,790
You should at least drink up a cup of cool mixed-nut-powder-tea.

342
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,470
Oh?

343
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,440
When did you come, Ki Ok?

344
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,730
Mom

345
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,180
No wait,

346
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,720
why are you wearing a hanbok?

347
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,490
Why are both of you wearing a hanbok?

348
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,500
Hey, Uhm Ki Ok!

349
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,190
You better get up!

350
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,060
Aiyoo, why are you yelling so loudly?

351
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,210
Be quiet!

352
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,020
Wh-why are they acting like this?

353
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,320
For what reason are these two kneeling?

354
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,370
I'm sorry mom..

355
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,880
We...got married.

356
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,680
Mar... What do you mean you got married?

357
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,540
Who married whom?

358
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,140
Even though I lack,

359
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,530
please accept me as your youngest Son-in-Law, Mother.

360
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,260
What do you mean, Mother-in-law?

361
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,270
Why am I your mother-in-law?!

362
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,960
We are back from registering our marriage.
 We even had our honeymoon.

363
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,660
Mom! Mom!

364
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,760
Get back to your senses! Mom!

365
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,460
Get the Chu...chu...chu...Chung Shim Hwan (relaxant)! Chung Shim Hwan! 
Quickly, quickly!

366
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,180
Mom!

367
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,740
Get back to your senses, Mom!

368
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,640
Water!

369
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,720
<i>Chae Won!</i>

370
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,660
Hey, bring it quickly, quickly!,

371
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,140
Mom! Hyung Nim, more!

372
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,880
Aiyoo.

373
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,950
Aiyoo!

374
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,640
Aiyoo.

375
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,610
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,840
Mom and Dad.

377
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,550
Mother-in-law and Father-in-law, we've committed a deadly sin.

378
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,670
What should we do with this person?

379
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,130
You frightful man!

380
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,050
Please calm down, Mother!

381
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,000
Let her be, Jun Bot Tae (utility pole).

382
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,720
Please hit me until you get out all of your anger out, Mother!

383
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,610
What precious daughter Ki Ok is to me, huh?

384
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,190
How dare your meager self can covet her, huh?

385
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,180
You worst thief, you!

386
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,220
Aigoo

387
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,110
This wench, this insane wench!

388
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:03,700
You couldn't find a man that you fall for a total old man!

389
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,660
Let's see.

390
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,930
To have you fall for a total old man did I send you to college in our tight budget?

391
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,250
Brought you up treasured?

392
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,400
Instead, let's you and I, in dishwater

393
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,410
put our noses in and die, DIE!

394
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,310
I'm sorry, mom.

395
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,730
Aigoo..

396
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,030
I'm really sorry.

397
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,570
Aigoo..

398
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,750
Aiyoo.

399
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,430
I should die to avoid this and that mess.

400
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,230
Aiyoo, Father! Mother!

401
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,690
Please take me with you!

402
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,620
Please take Kkeut Soon!

403
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,400
Aiyoo, Mom! Please stop it.

404
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,660
Let go!

405
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,400
Your younger sibling, your sister-in-law, is

406
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,960
walking down the wrong path, you all are sitting there &amp; watching it like it's someone else's problem.

407
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,060
You irresponsible beings, you!

408
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,820
We've done plenty to discourage and stop, mother-in-law.

409
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,140
That's right.

410
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,080
Me and Sister-in-law have barged in to the rooftop apartment, and caused as much trouble as possible.

411
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,610
Hyung (Older brother) and I also,

412
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,910
did plenty of grabbing and forcing them to stop but

413
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,910
they were unresponsive.

414
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,730
Ai, just die.
Oh, mother-in-law!

415
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,580
When has your mind slipped?

416
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,320
Mother.

417
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Like a ghost that ate a cow,

418
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,980
Why are you staying still?

419
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,890
Are you saying that you approve this marriage?

420
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,610
Is that it?

421
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,900
Leave my house right now.

422
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,100
Father.

423
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Doing this without your parent's consent.

424
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,500
Isn't doing this saying that you no longer want to live with your parents?

425
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,100
Take this person and leave.

426
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,710
Father-in-Law.

427
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,900
Who are you to call me father-in-law?

428
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,720
I don't have a son-in-law like you.

429
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,650
Son-in-Law Min!

430
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,110
Yes, Father.

431
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,190
Drag those two out immediately.

432
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,130
Right now!!

433
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,980
Dad!

434
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,930
Father!

435
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,720
Leave it alone.

436
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,190
It's best if you stop here today.

437
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,290
Hurry and stand up!

438
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,580
That's right.

439
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,580
Listen to him.

440
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,330
Mom...oh my god what do we do?

441
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,210
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

442
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,000
After you listen to this message, call me.

443
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,910
I have something to confirm.

444
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,150
Please, Choon Hee!

445
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,170
The diary...

446
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,040
Would Choon Hee have taken it?

447
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,080
No! No! No!

448
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,810
<i> Thank you young man. </i>

449
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,140
<i>Ahjumma..</i>

450
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,890
<i>I'm Chae Won's mom.</i>

451
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,380
<i>Aiyoo, this is my favorite flower.</i>

452
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,830
<i> For some reason, I thought that these flowers would suit Mother the best. </i>

453
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,820
<i> Go on a date with me, Mother. </i>

454
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,890
<i> A date? </i>

455
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,690
<i> I will go to the market with you, so let's go market-seeing. </i>

456
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,460
<i> How is it? </i>

457
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,540
<i> It's the best! </i>

458
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,800
How could this have happened?

459
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,120
He's my son that came out of me.

460
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,550
He was right in front of me.

461
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,770
Like a stupid person,

462
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,570
how could I not have recognized him at all like that?

463
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,400
Can you still be a mother?

464
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,730
They say blood is thicker than water.

465
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:47,140
How could I not see it with my own eyes, stupid?

466
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,170
Fool!

467
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,580
What?!

468
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,420
Do you,

469
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,280
by any chance-

470
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,170
Have the diary?

471
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,840
How...

472
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,660
do you have that?

473
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,900
I was wondering why you were running away from me!

474
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,060
Chun Hee,

475
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,390
let's meet.

476
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,660
Let's meet and talk.

477
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,080
Enough!!

478
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,510
I don't need to meet with you.

479
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,050
I'm going to meet with my son and tell him the truth.

480
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,290
I'm going to take my son with me!

481
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,330
Choon Hee, don't hang up the phone!

482
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,780
Let's meet for now.

483
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,230
Let's meet,

484
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,110
I will tell you from the beginning.

485
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,830
Choon Hee! No! You can't take Se Yoon!

486
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,680
Choon Hee! Se Yoon...no!

487
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,980
You can't.

488
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,230
The Director has gone out out and is on his way here.

489
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,360
What kind of tea shall I give you?

490
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,830
It's fine. I'm fine.

491
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,410
Don't worry, so go back to your work.

492
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,020
Yes.

493
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,520
The son that I thought died...

494
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,730
To a total stranger with no blood tie,

495
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,780
he called them mom and dad, for 30 long years.

496
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,470
What should I do?

497
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,480
How do I handle this fury and resentment?

498
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,740
Mom!

499
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,620
Oh, Se Yoon.

500
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,390
Do you and dad have an engagement?

501
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,100
Yeah..

502
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,760
I had an errand to run in the area,

503
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,990
and to see your face too.

504
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,270
To kill the two birds with one stone.

505
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm glad you came.

506
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,150
Right now, Chae Won's mother is in my office.

507
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,140
Chae Won's mother...

508
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,490
Why did she come?

509
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,540
Director! I came to talk about the contract.

510
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,110
Madam, you've come.

511
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,980
Then why don't you discuss work? I'll go up first.

512
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,860
Yes, Mom.

513
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,830
Let's go.

514
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,490
First,

515
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,570
let's go out and talk.

516
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,600
You!

517
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,170
You didn't only steal Se Yoon,

518
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,710
but you also stole my life!

519
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,150
Did you not know that Mother Superior

520
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,560
had dementia?

521
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,270
Naively,

522
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,710
the things in the diary...

523
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,110
Are you believing everything right now?

524
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,510
You're denying it to the end.

525
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,620
Unfortunately for you,

526
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:18,800
That diary was written way before Mother Superior has gotten dementia!

527
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,500
What should we do since it was written 30 years before?

528
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,210
If you keep saying these things,

529
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,310
I can have a gene test.

530
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,270
Let's speak

531
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,180
in a quiet place.

532
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,690
Here,

533
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,490
Employees are around.

534
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,300
It's our company.

535
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:42,810
I told you!

536
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,200



537
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,820
I didn't come to meet you,

538
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,890
but I came to meet my son!

539
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:53,630
Please. Please calm down.

540
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,830
Listen to what I say first.

541
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,150
You can meet Se Yoon and speak with him anytime!

542
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,230
Please. Please.

543
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,250
To me, too.

544
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,340
For the last time,

545
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,600
give me a chance to explain, Choon Hee.

546
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,230
For the past 30 years,

547
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,470
I haven't slept in peace for even one day,

548
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,440
I haven't laughed freely.

549
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,310
Because every time I see Se Yoon,

550
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,810
I remember your face, Choon Hee.

551
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,700
I wanted to die.

552
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,500
After stealing all of

553
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,960
someone else's life,

554
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,540
you thought you wouldn't even suffer that much?

555
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,540
How could you wear a human mask,

556
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,650
and do such a thing?

557
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,020
You're not even human!

558
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,650
After the doctor's prognosis that I could not get pregnant,

559
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,590
he was a child that I gave birth to with great difficulty.

560
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,390
My mother-in-law was pressuring my husband

561
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,590
to birth a son outside of our marriage.

562
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,270
If they knew that

563
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,880
something went wrong with the child,

564
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,350
I thought that things might return to the awful past,

565
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,790
and in a moment I committed a sin

566
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,290
that could not be taken back.

567
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,300
After sending the child's father and the child to heaven,

568
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,570
you saw me wander around like a crazy woman without her mind,

569
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,980
and yet, how could you do that to me?

570
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,710
So that's why you sent me to America!

571
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,270
To separate me from my son!

572
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,010
To separate me from the Head Nun!

573
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,080
Ah, stupid idiot!

574
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,900
I didn't even know that, and was thinking you were my life's benefactor.

575
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,660
You were not in your right mind at the time!

576
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,920
You were not capable of raising a child then!

577
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,490
You had depression,

578
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,340
and it was hard to take care of even yourself.

579
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,500
How could you raise a child?

580
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,050
And,

581
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,280
when you went to the hospital to abort the child in your stomach,

582
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,710
it was me that dragged you home.

583
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,710
If it wasn't for me,

584
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,260
my Sae Yoon would not have come into this world.

585
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,030
Even if I hadn't brought Se Yoon then,

586
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,530
you would have given him up for adoption.

587
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,130
At that time, you had no will to raise a child.

588
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,040
So,

589
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,420
for raising him instead of giving him up for adoption,

590
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,670
I should be thankful?

591
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,270
Isn't that too shameless?

592
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,800
I'm sorry Choon Hee.

593
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,690
My whole life, until I die,

594
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,370
I'll live with a mind of atonement.

595
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,360
I don't need any of it.

596
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,020
I'm going to go immediately to get my son!

597
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,500
Choon Hee!

598
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,990
He doesn't know anything,

599
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,120
and he's doing well,

600
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,470
so let's not make him confused.

601
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,460
Keep my two eyes open, and lose my child?

602
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,660
My Sae Yoon...

603
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,930
lost his sense of taste.

604
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,370
He became like that three years ago after losing his girlfriend in a car accident,

605
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,970
if we say that he has a birth mother...

606
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,940
its so terrible I don't even want to imagine that!

607
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,060
I'm not asking you

608
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,140
to do that for me.

609
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,510
For the sake of my Sae Yoon..

610
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,250
for my Sae Yoon..

611
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,490
Don't make me laugh!

612
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,590
I'm going to whatever it takes,

613
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,440
to bring back my son.

614
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,370
Choon Hee!!!!

615
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,790
Don't call my name with that dirty mouth!

616
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,250
You thief!

617
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,820
Choon Hee!

618
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,600
Choon Hee... Choon Hee...!

619
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,200
Se Yoon... You can't, Choon Hee!

620
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,440
No..

621
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,760
Our Se Yoon..

622
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,140
This is a noodle that just came out recently,

623
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,540
try it out and please tell everyone about it!

624
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,500
Yes..

625
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,260
Thank you..

626
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,850
Come again!!

627
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,460
Goodbye!

628
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,490
Yah,

629
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,550
the whole day its bustling with customers!

630
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,930
Today's sales are going to be high!

631
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,330
Bro, let's go!

632
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,820
Okay~!

633
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,480
Ah, welcome!

634
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,410
Welcome!

635
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,760
Did you come to buy noodles?

636
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,330
Just give me 10 packages.

637
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,490
A whole 10 packages?!

638
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,630
I was told to buy 10 packages.

639
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,120
Oh, alright!

640
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,450
There's regular noodles, and noodles that have been stretched by hand, which one would you like?

641
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,930
I was told just to buy the most expensive one!

642
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,810
By who?

643
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,210
The bachelor in front of here told me to.

644
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,560
Ah yeah, thank you for your work.

645
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,710
When the next woman comes back, you can go in, okay?

646
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,480
Got it.

647
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,240
And, you have to act naturally, like you really came to buy noodles.

648
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,450
You must not make it obvious that you're being paid to do this.

649
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,120
I understand, don't worry.

650
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,180
Okay okay~!

651
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,360
It's the first time in my life making money so easily!

652
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,630
It's the first time spending money so easily myself!

653
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,550
What is this?

654
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:57,440
The next time you need to hire people, call me.

655
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,300
I'll bring a whole group with me.

656
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,560
Oh, okay okay I got it!

657
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,190
Hmm..

658
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,330
Oh she's back!

659
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,410
Noodles! Hand me the noodles.

660
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,930
Where are the noodles?

661
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,000
Look here, Kim Cheol Gyoo!!

662
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,720
Are you joking right now?!

663
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,850
A joke? If you don't acknowledge my sincerity, I'll be very upset, honey.

664
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,250
Didn't I tell you to stop calling me that?!

665
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,430
I'm sorry, honey.

666
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,260
Honey is stuck to my mouth.

667
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,840
Why are you doing this?

668
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,530
Why? Why?

669
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,420
You're working so passionately at the factory,

670
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,460
so I was looking for ways to be of help to you.

671
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,710
In a phrase, I'm like your Daddy-Long-Legs.

672
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,300
You must have nothing to do.

673
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,070
Do you not even work at your own company?

674
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,980
Yes!

675
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,240
I completely gave up working there.

676
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,530
Joo Ri quit working at Lee Se Yoon's company, and came to our company to work.

677
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:22,630
And she's getting along great with our Mom, so she does most of the work now.

678
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,020
And as for me, I'm there for looks.

679
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,820
You lost your work to your younger sister,

680
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,890
and aren't you even embarassed of yourself?

681
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,640
You know too, that I don't care much for company work.

682
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:40,060
All I care about, whether I'm sitting or standing, is you.

683
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:45,430
All I think about is, what can I do to make you forgive me and accept me again.

684
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:47,550
Nothing like that will ever happen,

685
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,780
so go help out your mom and sister at your company.

686
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,690
And if you come back again to play jokes again,

687
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,830
I'm going to tell my uncles about you,

688
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,900
don't even come near the factory.

689
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,580
Honey, aren't you being too harsh?

690
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,140
If I tried this hard, even a stone Buddha statue would give in.

691
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,750
How could you be so cold towards me?

692
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,160
I told you before!

693
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,690
I love Se Yoon.

694
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,710
Honey, I've changed!

695
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,400
I'm a completely new person! No longer the mama-boy I used to be.

696
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,760
I rebel against my mom all the time now!

697
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,030
I don't want to hear about this.

698
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,690
Just you wait, you are going to come back to me.

699
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,420
I'm going to make you.

700
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:40,490
Ah~

701
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,280
what is all this?

702
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,190
Can't you tell, its noodles.

703
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,520
Yes I know, but why did you buy so many noodles by the box?

704
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,290
Oh, I was buying up some of Chae Won's noodles.

705
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,580
Whew, oh my gosh,

706
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,600
you're so busy going around spending money, aren't you CEO Cheol Gyu?

707
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,550
I have to help her, since she gave up working at the company and started work at the noodle factory.

708
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,730
And you know, I like noodles.

709
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,160
If you like noodles that much, you should be eating our company's noodles, not some other company's.

710
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,200
Our company makes noodles?

711
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,000
Whew, jeez.

712
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,680
Even if you are just around for show, isn't this too much?

713
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,330
I've never heard about it before though.

714
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:26,610
Joo Ri brought all the researchers and subcontractors from Se Yoon's company to our company.

715
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,710
Isn't that being a company spy?

716
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,960
Spy? Watch what you're saying.

717
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,480
If you're not, then never mind. And, it hasn't even been that long since we launched our new product.

718
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,420
We're producing noodles now?

719
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,490
Mom, aren't we straining the company?

720
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,400
Ah, you just wait around and reap the rewards.

721
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,730
Not too far ahead, Geum Yong Foods

722
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,960
will take over the noodle market.

723
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,930
She said she'd be in the office, but when I came, she wasn't here.

724
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,750
She isn't even answering her phone.

725
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,010
Was there any contact from her?

726
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,030
No.

727
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,020
Then, did she leave with my mom ?

728
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,920
With your mom?

729
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,870
My mom actually came by earlier too.

730
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,480
Okay, anyways I got it, talk to you later.

731
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:21,110
How did things go?

732
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,970
I think that we need to give up the new noodles we were about to launch,

733
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:28,660
and plan for a new product asap.

734
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,260
Why did mother go to Se Yoon's company?

735
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,210
How is grandma?

736
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,710
She seems better after taking some medicine,

737
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,400
but I'm really worried about her.

738
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,620
But, where has your mother been the whole day?

739
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:05,250
Mom! Are you okay?

740
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,090
No, I'm fine.

741
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,720
I'm going in to rest a while.

742
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,990
Where have you been all day long?

743
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,830
There was a huge commotion today.

744
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,010
A commotion?

745
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,620
Rooftop and my sister-in-law came back from their honeymoon,

746
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,320
and mother-in-law lost her mind,

747
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,970
father-in-law told them to leave this house immediately,

748
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:48,830
it was a huge commotion.

749
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,530
Yes...

750
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,530
I'm going to lie down because I feel tired...

751
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:57,810
Do you feel sick?

752
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:02,250
It seems like you have a fever...

753
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,340
It's nothing.

754
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,200
There was something I needed to take care of today, that's all.

755
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,080
Dad, mom, I'm going inside.

756
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,350
Yes,

757
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:24,940
Drink this, its cool.

758
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:39,600
<i>If it's discovered that Se Yoon is actually my son,</i>

759
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,050
my Chae Won...what will happen to her?

760
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,590
Do you have something to say to Chae Won?

761
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:57,160
No, I don't have anything to say.

762
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,610
A little while ago, I got a phone call from Se Yoon.

763
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,090
Why? Why did Se Yoon call?

764
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:12,090
He said you were going to wait for him in his office, but when he came you weren't there.

765
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,730
That's why he called.

766
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:18,360
Why did you go there?

767
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:25,400
I was in the area, and stopped by to maybe have some tea.

768
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,620
It was nothing.

769
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,430
I'm so enraged I can't live!

770
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,390
I'm so furious I can't stand it!

771
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:47,810
Ah!!!!!!!

772
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,990
I have to go immediately to get Ki Ok!

773
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:54,320
It's no use to sit around doing nothing.

774
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:57,320
Leave her alone.

775
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,380
Leave her alone? Then what?

776
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,520
Are we just going to watch that 60-year-old gigolo live with our daughter?

777
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,280
Like watching a fire from across a lake?

778
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,240
Didn't I say, it will be just as though we never had her as our child.

779
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,100
How can we act like she's not our child?

780
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,150
I can't do that!

781
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,460
Calm down mother-in-law, please.

782
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,400
Does it look like I can calm down now?

783
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,330
I have to go break at least one of that old gigolo's legs.

784
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,740
Only that way, will I be able to feel better.

785
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,960
Mother-in-law!!!!

786
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,100
Hurry!

787
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,360
Is this the place

788
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,520
that the old gigolo sings?

789
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,970
There it is, on that huge poster.

790
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:17,990
That... that... that bastard... that creep is like an old gigolo.

791
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:22,070
He's not just an old gigolo, but he's a wolf with 99 tails!!!

792
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm going to go and cut off each and every one of those 99 tails tonight!

793
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,640
Let's get going!

794
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,980
Oh!

795
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,930
Grandma, what business do you have here?

796
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,610
What business?

797
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:42,020
I came to dance at the cabaret!
Do you think I came to buy taffy?

798
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,070
It's going to be trouble if you hurt your back dancing at that age!

799
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:49,480
Go home and watch your grandkids!

800
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,200
You can't discriminate people like that!

801
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,720
What are you doing right now?

802
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,820
You two, don't you even have a mother and father!?

803
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,120
ARGH!

804
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,330
No, you can't go in!

805
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,480
AGH!!

806
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,400
AHHHH!

807
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,260
Mother, please go home.

808
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,480
Why all this noise?

809
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:11,990
What are you!@!#@#

810
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:16,210
-You're interfering with business. Please leave!
-<i>Won't you let go?! Won't you let go?!</i>

811
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,600
You need to filter these kind of people out.

812
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,370
Watch it!

813
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:23,200
Oh my gosh!!!

814
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,570
<i>♫ No matter how hard and desperate it gets...</i>

815
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:31,070
<i>♫ I came into this world with nothing, and I'll leave with nothing.</i>

816
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:35,000
<i>♫ I have nothing to lose.</i>

817
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,440
<i>♫ Break away... Break away...
♫ Break away... Break away...Break away...</i>

818
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,830
<i>♫ I'll break away from my suffocating life.</i>

819
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:45,690
<i>♫... I'll just run towards my future.</i>

820
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:50,360
<i>♫ I'll break away from my suffocating life.</i>

821
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,650
The singer who's singing right now...

822
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:56,750
Mr. Kang Jin?

823
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,580
Tell him to see me after he's done singing.

824
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,150
<i>Ok, I got it.</i>

825
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:05,220
You crazy thief! Bastard!

826
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,230
Mother-in-law!

827
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,850
Mother-in-law? Who's your mother-in-law?!

828
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,680
You wrecked my daughter's bright future, you enemy bastard!

829
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,420
<i>You bastard... You bastard...</i>

830
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,480
Mother! You can't do this!

831
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,190
Let go of this, and then talk.

832
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,830
<i>Hey, you guys...</i>

833
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:27,730
My daughter's future is totally wrecked!

834
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,970
Is his singing important?

835
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,390
Let go.

836
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,160
Watch out, watch out!!

837
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,420
Hey! Let go of her!

838
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,470
Let go!

839
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:41,020
Don't you have your parents?

840
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:43,900



841
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,660
<i>Hey!</i>

842
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,490
If you even touch me...!
I ate honey too!

843
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,970
You guys are dead if I lose a strand of my hair, got it?!

844
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,780
Kang Sook!

845
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,690
Bong Soo oppa!

846
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,870
It's you, Kang Sook!

847
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,310
Due to a personal problem, I sincerely apologize for not finishing my performance.

848
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,330
I'll come back shortly to give a great performance.

849
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,410
<i>What the heck!</i>

850
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:23,480
Why are they being like this?

851
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,890
Ah...

852
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,330
Kang Sook...

853
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,230
I'll say this again.

854
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,130
Even if I were to die and come back alive 100 times,

855
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,980
I have no intention of having you as my son-in-law.

856
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:50,630
Go nullify your marriage registration immediately, and return our Ki Ok.

857
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:55,440
How can I nullify our marriage registration, Mother-in-law? It's already done with.

858
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,010
It wouldn't have been enough even if you begged and said, " I committed an unspeakable crime, and I was wrong, Elder".

859
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:03,070
What good thing have you done that you're talking back like that?

860
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:06,430
Aiyoo... Mother-in-law, let's go home and talk about it.

861
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,980
We got away by begging them not to turn us over to the police for interfering with their business.

862
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:15,380
By the way, where did Bo Reum's mom go?

863
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,930
Sugar Entertainment
Kang Bong Soo

864
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,210
Oh my god!

865
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,850
It seems like you're really successful, Oppa.

866
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:40,760
Not really. It's like having a small store.

867
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,610
Wow! You haven't changed at all, Kang Sook!

868
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:47,250
No way.

869
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,080
Oppa.

870
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,740
Did you get married?

871
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,570
Not yet

872
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,230
You haven't gotten married yet?

873
00:56:55,490 --> 00:57:00,080
Since I can't find anyone like you, I'm remaining a bachelor.

874
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,940
You can joke easily.

875
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,450
My Kang Sook, you're married of course, right?

876
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,310
We got divorced.

877
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,090
Then, those women I saw earlier...

878
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,520
They are my in-laws.

879
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,120
Your in-laws, I see.

880
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,440
I have a younger sister-in-law. The old gigolo who sang earlier, I mean,

881
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,100
the singer... She hitched up with him.

882
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,530
Then, the woman who came up to the stage

883
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,280
is your mother-in-law, right?

884
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,790
Ah, yes. That's correct.

885
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,180
What are you doing here?

886
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,000
Aiyoo, Mother-in-law is waiting.
What are you doing here?

887
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,360
Who is that?

888
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,100
Oppa, I think I have to go.

889
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,400
You must call me.

890
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,620
Yes, Oppa.

891
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,890
Oppa?

892
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:10,940
Aish..

893
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,950
Please take them home safely.

894
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,940
Mother-in-law, Seul Hong's mom, Bo Reum's mom, have a safe trip.

895
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,720
Aiyoo.

896
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,210
You're Kang Jin, who sang "Break Away", right?

897
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:49,940
Pardon?

898
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,870
I'm Kang Bong Soo from Sugar Entertainment.

899
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,850
Would you like to draw up a contract with me?

900
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,770
Contract?

901
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:09,270
<i>No matter what I have to do, I'll get my son back!</i>

902
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,540
<i>Hey, Choon Hee...!</i>

903
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,860
<i>Don't call my name with your filthy mouth!</i>

904
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,320
<i>You're a thief.</i>

905
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:26,690
Mother.

906
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:27,880
Oh!

907
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,700
You got off work late.

908
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,710
I had some work to finish up.

909
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,960
Were you crying?

910
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,570
No, I wasn't crying.

911
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:45,510
When I went up to the office earlier, you and Chae Won's mom weren't there. Did you go somewhere together?

912
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,010
Huh?

913
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:50,520
Oh... you seemed busy.

914
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,260
We parted after having a cup of tea together.

915
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:03,450
<i>According to the information I got, it's seems like your mother-in-law and your mom have a very bad relationship.</i>

916
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,770
Hey, Mom.

917
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,810
Uh... Why?

918
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:16,890
I'll take care of the laundry, so why don't you go to bed, Mom? You look tired.

919
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:21,330
Ok... You must be tired too. Go rest.

920
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:25,650
Se Yoon...

921
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,350
Our son...

922
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:36,230
let me hug you once.

923
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,740
Is there something wrong Mother?

924
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:54,330
Do you hug only if something's wrong?
Mom's hugging you because I want to.

925
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:00,690
Before I get married, I'll do as you say, so hug me as much as you want.

926
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,670
I'm sorry my son...

927
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,070
<i>Your mom couldn't recognize you.</i>

928
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,610
I'm sorry.

929
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,400
Have you been waiting long, Mother-in-law?

930
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,510
No, I just got here.

931
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,860
I see...

932
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,870
Did you run here?

933
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,450
Yes.

934
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,490
Since you told me you had something urgent to say, I rushed here.

935
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,560
Is something going on, Mother-in-law?

936
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,490
I'm sorry.

937
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,180
Pardon?

938
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,970
I'm really sorry.

939
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,690
But with our Se Yoon...

940
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,640
I think you have to part from him.

941
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,070
Pardon?!
