<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

2
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:07,545
<i>Episode 46</i>

3
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,420
Where is this place?

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,570
This is the place where we'll get married.

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,590
Se Yoon!

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,100
If we don't do it like this, maybe we'll be finished forever.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,190
This could be our last chance.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,040
But, if someone gets hurt because of us...

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,540
In life,

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,500
because of me, someone could get hurt from one thing or another.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,870
That person is our mom.

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,870
Why aren't you looking out for your own interests?

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,370
You're so bothered when others are in pain.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,660
Do you really not care about your own sufferings?

15
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,020
And what about me?

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,480
If I'm in pain,

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,800
and if I get wounded,

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,970
you don't care?

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,320
Se Yoon.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,420
Do you have the confidence that you can call me Oppa?

21
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,760
I don't have the confidence to accept it.

22
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,060
When I see you, I want to kiss you, hold your hands, and hug you.

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,290
I don't want to live rest of my life hearing "Oppa" from you.

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,640
I will prepare and take care of everything.

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,670
You just have to stay by my side.

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,640
Please have courage.

27
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,490
Don't be a coward anymore.

28
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,400
Got it?

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,460
What are you doing right now?

30
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,440
Can't you see?

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm drinking alcohol.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,870
This person... seriously!

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,650
Se Yoon

34
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,380
left home.

35
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,950
What?!

36
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,840
He said just by themselves...

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,970
they will have a wedding ceremony.

38
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,280
Are you in your right mind?!

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,200
You should have stopped him!

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,510
Did you just watch him go?!

41
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,840
Of course that's what I did.
 What right do I have to stop him?

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,170
I didn't even give birth to him.

43
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,430
I'm the mom who stole him.

44
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,520
What can I do?!

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, you too

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,250
leave.

47
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,920
If Se Yoon

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,570
marries Chae Won,

49
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,510
you said you will divorce me.

50
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,880
I'll let you divorce me!

51
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,310
You leave me too.

52
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,120
This person...

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,230
Anyway,

54
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,910
I'm always alone.

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
You can all leave me.

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,540
I'll be alright.

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,970
What did you do that is good?
Why are you having a drunken tantrum?

58
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,290
Only if you

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,700
didn't drive him to the edge,

60
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,290
our Se Yoon

61
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,920
would not have made such a desperate choice.

62
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,460
So...

63
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,040
Are you blaming me, right now?

64
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,410
You should have just let them get married!

65
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,220
Then, Se Yoon wouldn't have left home!

66
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,440
You took

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,150
our son away from me!

68
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,200
Give me back my son.

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,260
Go get our Se Yoon!

70
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,510
You have the audacity to accuse me, when you're the one who's done wrong!

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,220
You're not salvageable!

72
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,230
What...?

73
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,550
Unsalvageable?

74
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,310
Fine.

75
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,710
If that's what you want,

76
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,080
I'll leave.

77
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,390
Alright.

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,980
Leave!

79
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,250
There is nothing to be afraid of.

80
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,880
I AM IMPENETRABLE!

81
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,090
I'm alright.

82
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,260
<i>Are you in there, Chae Won?</i>

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,680
Is she still at the factory?

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,720
Chae Won is not in bed.
 She's not here.

85
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,480
What are you talking about, Father-in-law?

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,540
Se Yoon came to me, and asked me if he could kidnap Chae Won.

87
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,880
I told him he could.

88
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,540
Pardon?

89
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,590
It seemed like the two will have a wedding ceremony.

90
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,490
Ah...

91
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,350
What are you talking about, Father-in-law?

92
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,580
What do mean wedding ceremony?

93
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,070
Who is marrying whom?

94
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,610
Who do you think? It's Chae Won and Se Yoon.

95
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,420
Father-in-law!

96
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,030
What did I tell you?

97
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,280
You should let things work out the way they are meant to be.

98
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,780
Even so!

99
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,560
Without parents' permission,

100
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,600
how could they elope?

101
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,250
This won't do!

102
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,780
It doesn't matter.
 They love each other.

103
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,800
Chae Won lost her mind.

104
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
Hiding from her parents,

105
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,920
how could she think of eloping?

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,120
Leave it.

107
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,360
It's already done with.

108
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,250
Let's just watch over them.

109
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm really disappointed!

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,330
What are you disappointed about...?

111
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,660
If you thought of Chae Won as your own daughter,

112
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,420
you wouldn't be like this.

113
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,200
If Se Yoon is your son, Chae Won is your daughter too.

114
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,220
As if nothing is wrong,

115
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,370
you say you want to get them married.

116
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,630
How could you talk like that?

117
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,130
I lived all this time regarding Chae Won as my own daughter.

118
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,180
Why is it so noisy?

119
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,260
What's going on?

120
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,000
You never yelled at each other before.

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,660
Why are you so loud?

122
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,100
What's the matter?

123
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm really disappointed!

124
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,260
Did you fight over Chae Won's marriage?

125
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,680
Sorry for being so loud, Mother.

126
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,010
According to Hyung, Seok Joon, this is the best bed and breakfast place in the neighborhood.

127
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,070
Let's spend the night here. After our wedding, let's go somewhere nice for our honeymoon.

128
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,210
You know Hyung, Seok Joon, don't you?

129
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,370
You met him once a long time ago.

130
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,930
He was working as a doctor in Namhae hospital.

131
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,230
Of course.

132
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,290
I contacted him a couple of times afterwards.

133
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,200
He is supposed to come to our wedding tomorrow.

134
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,000
He will be an important witness for our wedding.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
And,

136
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,270
our wedding will be officiated by Seok Joon's brother-in-law.

137
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,150
He's the pastor for the church we visited earlier.

138
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,440
When did you prepare all this?

139
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,950
I'm a very capable man.

140
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,270
Ah, what's this?

141
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,790
I said the joke so you can laugh. So serious.

142
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,150
You're right.

143
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,120
You are

144
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,340
too good for me.

145
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,820
Even though I got you in the car, drove down,

146
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,510
honestly, I was worried that you might insist on going back to Seoul.

147
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,120
Since you're acknowledging me like this, I feel relaxed.

148
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,570
I barely got the postponement until 10 AM tomorrow.

149
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,040
Will we get the money before then?

150
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,460
Both Kim executive director and the head of the operations

151
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,260
They are

152
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,330
trying their best, so we have to trust them.

153
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,630
I'm sorry, Mom.

154
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,890
If I came to my senses a little earlier,

155
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,010
the company would not be this messed up.

156
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,080
I was too unconcerned before.

157
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,060
Aigoo...

158
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,310
Even though it's a little late,

159
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,910
it seems like you came to your senses.

160
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,150
I feel good about it.

161
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,830
<i>I can't live with my pride having been stepped on like this.</i>

162
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,250
I'm too angry to end it like this!

163
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,240
This wench, Joo Ri, why is she being like this?

164
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,990
Hey, Kim Joo Ri! Are you drinking?!

165
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,740
Aiyoo...

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,230
After one of them came to their senses,

167
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,550
the other one turns me inside out.

168
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,600
Aigoo... my life, even a dog wouldn't bite me.

169
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,430
She's crazy.. You must've really gone crazy. You're not even afraid.

170
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,670
You're having a drunken tantrum again.

171
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,030
Let go of it!! After I drink this,

172
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,200
I'll just die.

173
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,110
Hey... hey... hey... You made all this mess. How dare do you whine?

174
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,120
How could you talk irresponsibly right now that you want to die?

175
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,910
Joo Ri is saying those words out of frustration, so don't get too upset.

176
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,400
Aigoo... Why should I blame anyone?

177
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm the dumb one who went along with you.

178
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,570
I spent all that money to educate you abroad.

179
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,070
Stupidly, you get played by a piddly supplier

180
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,910
with those people, this company...

181
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,370
you messed it up like this. You idiot!

182
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,450
Did I know things would turn out this way?

183
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,140
I wanted to succeed, and

184
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,390
deliver a blow to Sunbae.

185
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,360
The only crime is that I tried my best.

186
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,090
You're talking about him again. Aigoo... I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it!

187
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,130
Anyway, he's the public enemy.

188
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,490
Being around Chae Won isn't enough, now, he made our company like this...

189
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,210
Why?

190
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,870
You're done eating?

191
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,810
Since you wanted to eat it, I went to Jangchundo to buy it.

192
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,210
It doesn't have the taste it used to have.

193
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,470
What?

194
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,480
My younger sister-in-laws' pig's feet have no smell, and they are chewy.

195
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,550
These don't have the same taste.

196
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,280
They don't smell.

197
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,070
I want to eat Bo Reum family pig's feet.

198
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,950
How can you eat their pig's feet right now?

199
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,470
I want to eat Bo Reum family pig's feet.

200
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,600
Really, I have to eat them.

201
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,120
<i>Boss, why aren't you marrying?</i>

202
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,490
<i>My long lost first love,</i>

203
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,280
<i>I found her again.</i>

204
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
Who else could it be?

205
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,970
Definitely it's me, Gong Gang Sook.

206
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,010
Oh my, that scared me!

207
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,190
What does she want again..?

208
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,720
Agasshi, why'd you call?

209
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,080
I wanted to eat your pigs feet, that's why I called.

210
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,750
The store's been long gone.

211
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,150
How can you request that?

212
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,740
I want to eat your's specifically

213
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,820
You must be craving pig feet because of your morning sickness,

214
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,470
ask your husband to go buy you some.

215
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,240
No, I have to eat your homemade pig feet specifically.

216
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,840
What is this crow-drops-lower-jaw-while-yawning kind of talk?

217
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,680
So what your saying is that you want me to make you pig's feet right now? Is that it?

218
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,190
During pregnancy, they say if you don't eat what you crave, the baby will be small.

219
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,190
Ah, hmph, no manners,

220
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,910
What time is it right now that you want me to make you pig's feet?

221
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,670
And furthermore, when it comes to pig feet, I'm personally disgusted by it.

222
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,290
I'm sorry but go just buy some.

223
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,410
I didn't want to have to resort to cheap rhetoric but

224
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,740
It looks like I'll have to call oppa.

225
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,360
Your brother only knows how to deliver pig's feet. Your brother knows nothing about how to make pig's feet.

226
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,090
Not that oppa..

227
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,800
Sugar Entertainments President Kang Bong Soo!

228
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,540
Bong- Bong Soo oppa?!

229
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,920
For your sake I wanted to keep my mouth shut

230
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,740
I guess, to you, a friendship with me is nothing special.

231
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,650
So if my brother is nearby, hand him the phone.

232
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,950
There should be some in the fridge.

233
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,910
It shouldn't take long to prepare.

234
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,110
So just hold on a bit, Agasshi.

235
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,140
Why pig's feet this late?

236
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,420
Agasshi wanted to eat it and asked me to deliver it.

237
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,340
She has a lot of nerve.

238
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,540
Who's she to ask for pig's feet this time of night?

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,490
What are you doing right now?!

240
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,040
How is being pregnant something special like earning a government post,

241
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,500
I'm going to call and scold her.

242
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,180
It's fine,

243
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,240
Mother hasn't even looked in her once,

244
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,360
at least I should look after her a bit.

245
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,760
And since it's due to pregnancy cravings,

246
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,560
I should do this.

247
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,560
What's with that look?

248
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,680
Honey, you're trying to score some points with me.

249
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,760
What?

250
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,570
If it was old you, you would have used all kinds of curse words and grumbled

251
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,000
you're boiling pig feet at midnight without any complaint.

252
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,660
Here!

253
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,980
Come be held by this broad chest.

254
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,330
I'll hug you til your ribs crumble.

255
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,630
Get out of here before your ribs crumble to bits by getting beaten by the pig feet.

256
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,630
She's pretending to fuss while she likes it.

257
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,380
To-night...

258
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,140
We're gonna do it!

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,470
Earlier, I was too harsh.

260
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,490
Even if i was mad,

261
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,160
I shouldn't have said that.

262
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,360
I just felt very frustrated,

263
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,820
so don't think much of it.

264
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,030
I...'ve done what I could do

265
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,860
Not once did I feel that Chae Won is

266
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,490
another's daughter.

267
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,390
But it seems it looked that way in your eyes.

268
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,120
Honey..

269
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,120
If I just wasn't here,

270
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,830
wouldn't our kids,

271
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,950
be able to get married?

272
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,800
What are you saying right now?

273
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,340
I..

274
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,670
even though it's true that Se Yoon is my child,

275
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,120
if I'm not Chae Won's mom..

276
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,910
Let's stop for now.

277
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,040
Honey, Choon Hee.

278
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,490
That person,

279
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,630
what is she thinking right now?

280
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,150
You must be tired, so rest.

281
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,680
I'll be in the next room,

282
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,830
So don't worry right now.

283
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,830
Sleep well.

284
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,400
Should I just sleep next to you tonight?

285
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,120
What?

286
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,910
It may be scary sleeping alone.

287
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,160
Let me sleep here.

288
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,540
Right over there, I'll do nothing but sleep.

289
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,950
Are you joking again?

290
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,640
I'm not joking.

291
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,860
I'm saying this because I'm really scared.

292
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,150
No way..

293
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,640
Just sleep in your room.

294
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,150
I know..

295
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,700
I was just joking.

296
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,310
Mom.

297
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,320
It's mom.

298
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,780
Don't answer.

299
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,160
Father also called several times.

300
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,820
They'll be worried.

301
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,450
let's turn off our phones until the end of our wedding tomorrow.

302
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,140
Until the wedding tomorrow,

303
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,990
I don't want to be in contact with anyone.

304
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,680
<i> The phone you have called is turned off at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

305
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,480
I heard from Grandfather.

306
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,690
Me, your wedding

307
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
I'll be happy about.

308
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,130
Have a beautiful wedding

309
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,450
and return home.

310
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,100
And to Se Yoon too,

311
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,490
tell him that I said congratulation.

312
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,540
I really wanted..

313
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,520
to see the wedding of you both.

314
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,970
I love you daughter,

315
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,840
and also son.

316
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,140
I feel weird..

317
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,730
<i>Chae Won and I,</i>

318
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,550
<i>will get married tomorrow as planned.</i>

319
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,540
<i>Hurry and go.</i>

320
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,440
<i>I hope you are happy together.</i>

321
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,510
<i>I don't have any thoughts of holding onto you.</i>

322
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,860
I'm sorry Mom.

323
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,140
What are you saying?!

324
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,840
Oh no, right now Chae Won is eloping without his parent's knowing? Is that what your saying?

325
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,510
What do you mean thief wedding (eloping)? I gave them permission.

326
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,630
Wait so everyone sitting here doesn't count and you are the only human here?

327
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,540
Are you saying if Mr. Um Pang Dal allows it, it's okay to go through the marriage ceremony?

328
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,050
Wow, total score! Chae Won noo-na (older sis) caused a big problem!

329
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,720
Hey, tsk.

330
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,370
But,

331
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,780
Does Se Yoon's family know this?

332
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,420
I bet Seol Joo was foaming at the mouth and fell backwards.

333
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:41,020
Is thief-wedding (eloping) in style these days? Gi Ok that wench and now Chae Won too...why are they acting like this?

334
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,240
The Uhm women, this won't do. We have to smack them back to their senses.

335
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,990
I didn't think Se Yoon would act this way. Disappointing.

336
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,810
Why?

337
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,050
Then now, how are we related to each other?

338
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:06,050
To the big-sis-in-law, is Se Yoon a son or son-in-law? It's really confusing.

339
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,590
Why do YOU need to worry about something like that?

340
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,760
Aren't you worried then?

341
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,950
I will leave first.

342
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,460
You barely ate last night's dinner too.

343
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,300
I have no appetite.

344
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,700
I will be back.

345
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,610
Aigoo.

346
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:34,430
Of course at this juncture would any food go down his throat?

347
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,850
Aigoo, how nicely this family situation is becoming.

348
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,280
Aigoo.

349
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,160
My wife, I'm finding out that she's a sleepyhead.

350
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,970
I already did my morning exercise and washed my face.

351
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:10,110
I was tossing and turning all night because I couldn't fall asleep. I think I finally fell asleep at dawn.

352
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,750
Did you sleep well Se Yoon?

353
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,910
Of course, as soon as I laid my head on the floor, I fell asleep soundly.

354
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,100
I saved some warm water for you to wash up. I'll help you.

355
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,050
Wait one moment.

356
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,070
For today, I'll give you a full service.

357
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,670
Full service?

358
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,610
I'll wash your face.

359
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,310
That's alright.

360
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,100
What's alright?

361
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,250
Only if you marry me, I won't let you get a drop of water on your hands.

362
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,820
Cleaning, doing laundry, washing dishes...

363
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,430
I'll do everything.

364
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,940
you're lying.

365
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,470
What do you mean I'm lying?

366
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,640
You just have to trust me.

367
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,860
That's alright.
I'll do it.

368
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,000
Ah... You really don't listen to me well.

369
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:17,660
Even before marrying, you don't listen to your husband very well. After marrying, won't you just nag and torment me?

370
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,930
What?

371
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,580
So please listen to your husband, my dear wife.

372
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,630
It's me, Ahjumma.
 Seul Hong's mom.

373
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,880
I think Sul Joo has turned off her cell phone, that's why I'm calling her at home.

374
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,560
Can I talk to Sul Joo?

375
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,520
Madam is not awake yet.

376
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,870
What time is it now...?

377
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,510
She drank late into the night.

378
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,280
I understand Ahjumma.

379
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,640
Please tell her that she must call me when she wakes up.

380
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,810
Did you call Unni, Sul Joo?

381
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,580
I think she's sleeping in after drinking late into the night.

382
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,890
Figures.

383
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,870
If the wind blows wouldn't it blow away, if grabbed wouldn't it break, (cared for as if one was fragile)

384
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,160
how much she devoted herself to Se Yoon.

385
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,090
To say it in a word, it's a sitting duck

386
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,880
Just in case, please don't misunderstand me, ok?

387
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,610
You know I'm a witness who's watched them for 30 years.

388
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,090
Seol Joo really did devote all to Se Yoon.

389
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:50,920
Things that Seol Joo did for Se Yoon... I couldn't do 1/100th or 1/1000th of that for my Soo Rung.

390
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,670
But,

391
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,190
I don't mean

392
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,450
to say that Sul Joo did a good thing..

393
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,130
I know.

394
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,080
I won't misunderstand, so don't worry.

395
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:24,500
<i>♫ I can't love you?</i><b><i>♫ I can't get closer to you?</i></b>

396
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,950
Where are we?<b><i>♫ Do we grow apart if I love you?</i></b>

397
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,360
We don't have much time left until the wedding ceremony. We have to get ready fast.

398
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,090
Get ready for what?

399
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,960
Are you going to get married like that?

400
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,430
<i>♫ I'm crying and waiting.</i>

401
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:50,930
<i>♫ Living like this isn't living.</i>

402
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,220
This would look good on you.

403
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,620
<i>♫ My longing for you becomes unbearable.</i><b><i>♫ I can't bear to forget you.</i></b>

404
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,620
<i>♫ I still only</i>

405
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,760
Do you like it?<b><i>♫ love you.</i></b>

406
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:23,880
<i>♫ I'll love you as long as I live.</i>

407
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,510
I can't think!
 Sit down, please.

408
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,610
My blood feels like it's getting dried up. How can I just sit around?

409
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,660
What about Joo Ri?

410
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,700
I don't know. She didn't even come to work?

411
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,000
That... rotten...

412
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,710
She gulped down the company with one swallow. Now, she's not even coming to work?

413
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:56,020
Not long ago, I was a puppet president. You applauded Joo Ri that she is taking care of everything for the company.

414
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,540
Aren't you disliking her too much?

415
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,540
They say even the king of Hades closes one eye in front of money.

416
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:09,050
She almost ruined the company that was running well, do you think I'd look at her kindly?

417
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,210
How did it go?

418
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,810
I'm sorry President.

419
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,030
LK Investment Firm also refused to lend the capital

420
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,380
just now

421
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,990
we've received a notification that the company is in preliminary bankruptcy.

422
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,910
What...rotten...h

423
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,680
Please notify the creditors immediately. We have to avoid the final bankruptcy.

424
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:35,220
In this kind of situation, there will be unreasonable demands from the creditors side.

425
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:42,050
We can't idly sit by and watch when the entire Geum Yoong company's employees might lose their jobs in a split moment.

426
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,620
The restructuring are debt-redemption plans have been readied, right?

427
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,860
Yes.

428
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,890
But...

429
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,950
the stockholders seem to be very nervous.

430
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:59,140
I'll give my life not to get delisted, so tell them not to worry.

431
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,810
Our Geum Young food will not die this easily.

432
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,660
Ok, I will catch a taxi now so just wait a bit.

433
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,740
Aigoo, where are you going?

434
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,020
I'm going to take a ride to Seong Gook Dong.

435
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,340
Why? Did something happen to Sul Joo?

436
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,780
I got a call form the ajumma there, and it feels weird.

437
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,080
What is weird?

438
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,990
She locked the door and there's been no sound from within it

439
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,780
somehow feels like a bad omen.

440
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,210
Ah...then

441
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,340
I'm worried so if anything happened call me.

442
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,300
Ok.

443
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,510
I'm sure nothing bad will happen.

444
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,640
right about now...

445
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,530
would the ceremony for the kids have begun?

446
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,670
Congratulations on getting married Chae Won.

447
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,070
You must be busy, thank you for coming.

448
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,830
Days like today is when we play hooky.

449
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,920
You look very beautiful.

450
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,500
Doesn't she?

451
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,580
Oh boy. Your condition is more serious then I thought (more deeply in love with her so brags about her).

452
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,120
What about my brother-in-law?

453
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,900
He went inside the church.

454
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,250
I'll be going inside.

455
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,230
Thank you.

456
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,620
For trusting me and being courageous..

457
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,840
I'll make it, so that it'll be easy to say "I'm glad I listened to him."

458
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:15,340
The Minister wants to start the ring exchange. I'll be right back.

459
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,430
Is it still...ajumma?

460
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,880
Yes.

461
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,200
Sul Joo, I came.

462
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,960
Are you still sleeping?

463
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,520
Open the door Sul Joo!

464
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,680
Something doesn't seem right.

465
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,110
You have a key right? 
 Yes.

466
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,070
Sul Joo?

467
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,710
Sul Joo? Sul Joo?

468
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,570
Why is she like this?

469
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,000
What is that?

470
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,810
What kind of medicine is that?

471
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:42,360
That is... It looks like anti-anxiety medication that madam always takes.

472
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:49,480
It looks like she took them while drinking.

473
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,860
Sul Joo? Wake up. Sul Joo?

474
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:01,120
Sul Joo. Come to your senses! Sul Joo!

475
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,980
<i>Hey! Come to your senses!</i>

476
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,380
You should call your mother before the wedding starts.

477
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,130
She must be very worried. Call her.

478
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,700
I'll call her when it ends.

479
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,440
Ok.

480
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,980
Are you guys all prepared?

481
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,900
Yes, Pastor.

482
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,080
<i>I heard from Grandfather.</i>

483
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,880
<i>I will accept the decision you've both made.</i>

484
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,830
<i>Have a beautiful and nice, </i>

485
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,190
<i>wedding ceremony and come back, alright?</i>

486
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,780
<i>Also, tell Se Yoon,</i>

487
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,370
<i>that mom sends her congratulation.</i>

488
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,160
<i>I really wanted to see the wedding between you two.</i>

489
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,860
<i>I love you, my daughter.</i>

490
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,180
and also son.

491
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,120
Chae Won!

492
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:13,290
Come Quickly, we're starting.

493
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,070
Ok, I'm coming.

494
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:39,030
We'll now start the wedding ceremony for the groom, Lee Se Yoon, and the bride, Min Chae Won.

495
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,310
Groom, enter.

496
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,570
Wow, looking cool.

497
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,350
Next, the bride will enter.

498
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,040
Bride, enter.

499
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,800
The bride will enter.

500
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,100
Bride come in.

501
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,170
I'll go outside and check.

502
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,080
I don't see the bride.

503
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,880
Chae Won! Chae Won!

504
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,520
Where are you?

505
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,040
The wedding started.

506
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,510
Just where are you?

507
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,710
Answer me!

508
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,130
Hello?

509
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,010
Chae Won?

510
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,980
Where are you right now?
I'm asking where you are.

511
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,660
Se Yoon.

512
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,660
Mom went to the emergency room in an ambulance.

513
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,330
They said she's in critical condition.

514
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,440
What did you say? 
 My aunt just called me and your mom...

515
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,720
They said she took some medication.

516
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,440
<i>Hurry up and go back to Seoul.</i>

517
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,240
Chae Won. 
 She must have been having such a hard time.

518
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,990
How can I go through with this wedding?

519
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,560
Do you think we'll be happy if we get married?

520
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,740
I can't.

521
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,500
Where are you?

522
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,300
First lets meet and talk.

523
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,470
I'm going to Seoul right now,

524
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,910
so you should see your mom, hurry.

525
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,790
Chae Won? Chae Won?

526
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,490
Chae Won?

527
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,460
<i>♫ In your eyes... </i>

528
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,940
<i>♫ If I could see you...</i>

529
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,850
<i>♫ Me, who's in your eyes...</i>

530
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,420
<i>♫ If I could see myself again...</i>

531
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,240
<i>♫ In your mind... </i>

532
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,610
<i>♫ I'm right here.</i>

533
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,520
<i>♫ If I could only go back</i>

534
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,680
<i>♫ into your heart again...</i>

535
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,900
<i>♫ In your eyes...</i>

536
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,270
Chae Won's mom.

537
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,170
What about Sul Joo?

538
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,120
She's still in there.

539
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,130
How is the patient, doctor?

540
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,690
If she had come later then we would have had a big problem.

541
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,450
When she arrived at the hospital, her breathing was about to stop.

542
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,420
So, she's alright right now?

543
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,370
She's over the hump, but she needs complete rest.

544
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,770
The patient has been misusing her medicine.

545
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:12,980
If she wants to stop using medicine, she needs to be treated in the hospital for a while.

546
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:19,110
Yes, you've worked really hard doctor. Thank you.

547
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,580
Sul Joo?

548
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:51,700
The housekeeper said that Se Yoon's father also left the house yesterday.

549
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:53,830
What?

550
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:58,090
The luckiest wife in all of Korea...

551
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,650
How could this have happened?

552
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,510
Is anyone home?

553
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,740
What brings you here?

554
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,860
Is Gong Kang Sook here?

555
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,230
I'm Gong Kang Sook.

556
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,820
I came to deliver a pot of flowers.

557
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,990
What is this about?

558
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,110
Who sent it?

559
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,700
By any chance, Kang Bong Soo?

560
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,400
Ok,

561
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,210
That's fine.

562
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,070
Ok then, I'll be leaving.

563
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,160
Bye.

564
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,320
Maybe because he's a successful man, his scale is different.

565
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,260
Instead of a few roses, he gives me a huge pot of flowers.

566
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,920
There's even a card.

567
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,080
He's very attentive.

568
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,490
I happened to go by a flower shop. I thought the bright flowers look like you, so

569
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,010
I'm sending them to you.

570
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,580
They are azaleas.

571
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:35,030
Azaleas symbolize first love.

572
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,430
First love.

573
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,680
This man! Why is he making me moved like this?

574
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,320
What is the occasion for the flowers?

575
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,540
When I saw those bright flowers as I passed by the flower shop, I thought of your wife.

576
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,000
Congratulations on the pregnancy.

577
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,150
Thank you.

578
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,460
But,

579
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,150
What kind of flower is this?

580
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,530
They are azaleas.

581
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,480
Azaleas symbolize first love.

582
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,540
First love?

583
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,670
A writer said this...

584
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,730
All love is first love.

585
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,150
The fact that you met the person and fell in love...

586
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,760
Definitely, that love happened for the first time in this life.

587
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,570
Ah... I thought I was the only romantic here.

588
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,900
My boss is one too!

589
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,670
Thank you.

590
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:41,940
Even though I may be a little awkward, there is a romantic side to me also.

591
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,580
Did you come all the way to my house to deliver the flowers?

592
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,690
Ah, I almost forgot.

593
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,080
Kang Jin,

594
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,580
I got your schedule to go on the air.

595
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,760
Broadcasting schedule?

596
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,880
Honey.

597
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,470
Bo Reum's mom.

598
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,120
Did mom go out?

599
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,800
No, she's watering the flowering plant.

600
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,770
Flowering plant?

601
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,700
What flowering plant?

602
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,930
She got it as a present from her friend.

603
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,280
Oh.

604
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,650
Tell your mom that I'm back and want her to come out.

605
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,070
Ok.

606
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,380
Wow, it's hot.

607
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,410
Dad says to come quickly and help him wash up.

608
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,170
Wash his back? What non-sense!

609
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,460
Tell him to take a shower.

610
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,790
<i>if your heart goes that way...</i>

611
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,160
<i>without thinking...</i>

612
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,930
I don't know how long it's been since I've received a present of flowers.

613
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,520
Thank you, Oppa.

614
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,500
And I didn't quite realize how Azalea blossom could be this stunning in the past.

615
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,960
Oppa your sincerity is

616
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,420
being conveyed...

617
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,840
Did this wife of mine get affected by heat?

618
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,410
what's all this fuss sending a text to a wrong person?

619
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,710
Oppa's sincerity is

620
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,930
What?

621
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,060
Oppa?

622
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,530
Isn't this cheating?

623
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,010
I bet my feeling has been conveyed with that text?

624
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,080
Oppa.

625
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,020
Ah, if you review the financial analysis report you will see that this situation is

626
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,540
not a bankruptcy in the red, but in the black.

627
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,420
Since it's a momentary cashflow shortage,

628
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,440
you the creditors could either provide the investment

629
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,670
or...ah...

630
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:14,050
ah...if you could extend the repayment period then

631
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,760
ah...I'll turn this crisis and

632
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,030
make into an opportunity.

633
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,440
There are two things our side wants.

634
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:26,460
Resignation of the entire current board of management team and,

635
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,150
the biggest share holder and the highest board member Ms. Bang Yong Ja will

636
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,400
by using privately owned assets contribution

637
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,900
take responsibility for the poor management.

638
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,070
Private assets contribution, did you say?

639
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,450
I understand.

640
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,150
If we can save the company, we will do anything.

641
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,480
Ah, that's enough.

642
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,230
President Kim Chul Kyu, step out of it.

643
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,860
I already transferred the shares and gave up my control so that should be enough

644
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,980
What do you mean, contributing privately owned assets?

645
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,260
Don't you think that's a bit too much.

646
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,430
I knew they would emerge like that.

647
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,050
If it wasn't for the alternative plan we've made,

648
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,140
with one misstep,

649
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,360
we could have become penny-less beggars and gotten out on the street.

650
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,840
What do you mean you've worked on an alternative ahead of time?

651
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,820
You remember she directed Hong attorney to exchange all real-estate property and the bank savings into cash.

652
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,020
That means we can't keep the promise we made to the creditors, isn't it?

653
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,610
Aigoo, aigoo, that simpleton.

654
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:30,420
Are you saying that we should give up our total assets and go out on the street?

655
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,520
I know what you're saying is true but...

656
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,700
After siphoning everything down to the last penny

657
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,680
and then I'm going to tell them to go take a hike.

658
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,660
What are they gonna do when I say I've got not a penny?!

659
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,360
<i>If you think our Chae Won as a real daughter,</i>

660
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,020
<i>you won't be acting like this.</i>

661
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,740
<i>If Se Yoon is your son then of course Chae Won is also your daughter,</i>

662
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,860
<i>how can you, as if unaffected,</i>

663
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,500
<i>say "let the two marry"?</i>

664
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:31,240
<i>What kind of relatives does that make us?</i>

665
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,870
<i>But really to Sister in law, is Se Yoon a son or a son in law?</i>

666
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,430
<i>What good comes from revealing the fact that Se Yoon is your son?</i>

667
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:48,050
<i>Eventually, isn't wounding the kids the only result?</i>

668
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,010
Why here?

669
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,110
Father, I want to go ahead and buy you clothes at least once.

670
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,030
I'm an old man who's headed for the Hades shortly,

671
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,100
clothes, what for?

672
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:25,330
Let's go inside, Father.

673
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,320
This one is handmade cloth.

674
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,490
It is the premium quality.

675
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:36,820
And this is a little lower priced Nam Huay burlap,

676
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,750
Chung Yang burlap, Moo Joo burlap

677
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,720
We also have Myung Joo and In Gyun.

678
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,460
Take your time looking,

679
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,840
and picking with the help of your daughter in law.

680
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,710
Father,

681
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,760
They say if one prepares the shroud ahead of time, one

682
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,390
will live for a long, long time.

683
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,420
Which is why we're buying them now,

684
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,510
instead of right now,

685
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,000
you're going to wear this after 20 years from now, okay?

686
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,500
Unexpectedly,

687
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,950
there are quite a variety.

688
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,390
Which one do you like?

689
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:34,540
This precious thing...can I receive it so shamelessly?

690
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,390
It's my desire, so please accept.

691
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,140
My thinking,

692
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,560
this one is good, Father.

693
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,240
Fabric is good and

694
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,370
stitches are neat, too.

695
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,310
That's fine.

696
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,450
It's all for naught when the flesh rots

697
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,670
There's no need to spend money on this.

698
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,960
Just get the least expensive.

699
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,120
I

700
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,700
have a lot of money squirreled away without Hyo Dong knowing.

701
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,360
Don't worry about anything.

702
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,580
Let's just take this one, Father.

703
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:18,330
There's no point spending money on useless things.

704
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,620
It's because this is the first present I am able to give you.

705
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,580
I want to give you the best I can.

706
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,040
Father,

707
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,830
make a promise with me.

708
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,310
This shroud

709
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,610
you have to wear it after 20 years have passed, okay?

710
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,980
You must.

711
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,270
Father, promise me.

712
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,780
I promise.

713
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,860
Who told you you can go in there?

714
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,320
Dad.

715
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,450
In your eyes, do you not see your grandfather, grandmother, mother and father?

716
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,490
What kind of worst behavior is this?
Is this what I taught you?

717
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,020
I'm sorry.

718
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:47,260
You did as you please and cause all this havoc, and you think it'll end by you just saying "I'm sorry"?

719
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,930
Where is Se Yoon? Why are you here alone?

720
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,310
We...

721
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,910
We didn't get married.

722
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:05,720
What?

723
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,720
I'm here.

724
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,700
Mom, I'm here.

725
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,100
Se Yoon is here.

726
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:02,370
<i>Mom, you really are a scary person.
Even after you've committed such wrong, </i>

727
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:10,350
<i>how can you, for 30 years, hold up a front as if nothing was wrong?</i>

728
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:16,450
<i>Whenever I think about it, it gives me the creeps and I'm horrified.</i>

729
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,720
<i>Honestly, I can't handle seeing your face.</i>

730
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,480
I'm really sorry, Mom.

731
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,370
For giving you a heartache,

732
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:39,960
I am really sorry.

733
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:11,170
I warmed it up, so drink some.

734
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,280
Thank you.

735
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,340
She drank alcohol with valium, so

736
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,610
she's gone into a shock.

737
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,230
Her stomach was pumped and is receiving an emergency care,

738
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,970
so no need to worry too much.

739
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,960
Not having the wedding because the bride disappeared..

740
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,650
Se Yoon must have been really surprised.

741
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,620
I'm..

742
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,300
an idiot, aren't I?

743
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,350
I was really just going to close my eyes,

744
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:06,000
and think only about me and Se Yoon.

745
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,200
But I couldn't.

746
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,790
I must really be an idiot.

747
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,560
It's not because your an idiot.

748
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,790
My daughter's heart is just,

749
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,440
really soft and kind.

750
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,580
That's why.

751
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,050
Se Yoon.

752
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:48,390
Must have been really hurt and disappointed.

753
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,960
When I think about it,

754
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,300
My chest hurts so much I feel like I'll die.

755
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,520
I know what you mean.

756
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,530
Our Se Yoon.

757
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:08,650
Se Yoon must really be suffering and hurting.

758
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:22,280
I'm sorry, Chae Won. I'm sorry.

759
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:29,130
Mom is really sorry.

760
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,940
Are you feeling better?

761
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,570
You...

762
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,530
How did you get here?

763
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,890
What about the wedding?

764
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,570
Did it go well?

765
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,510
What about Chae Won?

766
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,330
Where..

767
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,630
is Chae Won?

768
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,740
The wedding,

769
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,910
Didn't happen.

770
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,410
What?

771
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,890
Aah.

772
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,150
Are you ok, mom?

773
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:13,970
Here, drink this medicine.

774
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,360
Chae Won! Chae Won!

775
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,470
There's a big problem.

776
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,580
What's going on so early in the morning.

777
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,640
What's wrong? 
 What happened?

778
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,230
Why, What's wrong? 
 What's wrong Hyung?

779
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:35,280
Dad what's wrong? What happened?

780
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,580
Your mom...Your mom..

781
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:43,400
What about Chae Won's mom?

782
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,280
She left home.

783
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,070
What?!?!

784
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,590
Dad, what do you mean she left home?

785
01:00:55,590 --> 01:01:00,200
She left divorce papers and left without a word.

786
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,810
What is this?

787
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,450
Your right. These are Divorce papers.

788
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:11,490
Why would she divorce you so suddenly?

789
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,580
Dad? Dad?

790
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,480
She appeared to be normal last night. Why the divorce all of a sudden?

791
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,590
What on earth is this?

792
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:27,530
Mom? Mom?

793
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,680
Se Yoon!

794
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,090
Mom...

795
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,300
Mom has left home.

796
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,230
What did you say?

797
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,950
She turned off her phone so there is no way to contact her.

798
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:04,690
I was wondering if she had contacted you.

799
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:11,320
If she calls me, I'll have my secretary to call you.

800
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,230
What?

801
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,000
Besides meeting for work,

802
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,520
I hope there won't be any meetings for personal reasons.
