So good.

And with the vanilla frosting,

5
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:09,929
it would make a lovely
cupcake wedding cake.

6
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:11,230

for a free sundae.

19
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,040
Well, what if you're wrong,

20
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,458
and she is the real deal?

21
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,493
A cupcake wedding cake
could be a lot of money.

22
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:42,628
We have to crack her B.S.

23

and then <i>us.</i>

- Doug Franklin.

- Where'd you meet?
- He's a fireman.

29

- He rescued my cat.
- Aw.

30

No "aw."
That's an insurance commercial.

- So where's the wedding?
- Barefoot on the beach.

Oh, no, thanks.
I can do it.

176
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,351
I was an Eagle Scout.

177
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:42,652
Man, there's just
not enough occasions

178
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,221
where I can brag about that.

179
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:47,457
The room is cute,
but really tiny.

180
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:52,059
We're gonna need a bigger
space, unless we're Hobbits.

181
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:53,797
Is this the door
to the adjoining room?

182
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:56,933
Well, that is an adjoining room, but
it's not included in your package.

183
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,368
Oh, damn it!

184
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:02,936
We should've known Han's package was
gonna be smaller than he said it is.

186
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,578
I'm sorry.
All the other cabins are booked.

187
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,747
I'll bring you some bedding
for the couch

188
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:13,516
at an additional price.

Well, I guess you guys

191
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,990
are the couple,
so I'll sleep on the couch.

192
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,158
I can sleep anywhere.

193
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,326
First two years of my life,

194
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:26,660
my bed was a pile
of unopened mail.

195
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,131
A big, roaring fire

196
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,133
is gonna be so romantic.

197
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:31,568
Come over here closer to me,

198
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:33,002
you big Eagle Scout.

00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:36,336
Well, now you sound
like my Scoutmaster.

Hey, don't start anything
you can't finish in a minute.

201

Max'll be right out.

202
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:44,848
Something tells me she's
not a consistent hand-washer.

203
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:46,115
You do your thing.

204
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,317
I'm just gonna sit right here,

205
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:49,486
and watch my man build a fire.

206
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,154
Oh, great, this is cedar!

207
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,388
It's gonna smell so awesome.

208
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,891
I love falling asleep
to the sound of a fire.

209
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,259
Oh, my God.

00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,393
I know, no business stuff,

211
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,362
but I just got a text
about a big order.

212
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:01,097
That's fine,
just remember this weekend--

213
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:03,166
Oh, I know, me and you.

214
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,169
Me and you,
me and you--

Max! Max.

Turns out the B.S. Bride
isn't B.S.

217
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:11,875
She wants pricing
on a wedding cupcake cake,

218
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,244
and a groom's cupcake cake,
for 300 guests.

[Exhales]
Great!

220
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,812
Almost as great
as these little fuzzy shoes!

221
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:20,850
They were
in a sealed plastic package.

222
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:22,886
I'm the first one
to ever open them.

223

To the sauna.

227
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,795
Hopefully, I'll be abducted
on my way,

228
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:34,063
but know
that even though I'm gone,

229
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:37,100
I'm happier up there
with my alien lover.

230

True, they don't have lips,

231
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:41,471

do have crazy-long fingers.

There might be bears.

00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,311
There were always bears
at my chalet in Aspen,

in the woods,
lying on the floors, everywhere.

I'll order more food.

350
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,484
No, sit!
Sit.

351
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:31,087
I'm the bad one.

352
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:33,355
This soup is "duh-mazing."

353
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:34,790
Just a word I made up

354
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,425
for when something's
so amazing, you're stunned,

355
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,127
and all you can say
is "duh."

356
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,862
Duh-mazing.

357
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:42,131
Yes, I'd like
to order anoth--

358
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:44,500
Yes, I'll hold.

359
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:47,834
I think the hold music
is just Roger singing.

360
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:49,305
Okay, hang up the phone.

361
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:50,773
Go sit and eat.
Come on.

362
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:52,341
Hurry before Max
eats the table.

363
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:54,310
No, you eat.

364
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,112
After all,
it's our special weekend.

365
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:57,480
I want you to enjoy it.

366
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,614
Well, okay,

367
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,416
but only because
it's a special occasion.

368
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,484
Good!

369
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:02,685
I'm gonna go take
a hot shower.

370
00:13:02,686 --> 00:13:03,986
Besides, it's always better
to make love

371
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:05,254
on an empty stomach.

372
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:08,588
That must be why there
are so many people in India.

373
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:11,193
Max, I got a favor to ask you.

374
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:13,028
Do you think you can go visit
your bear friends next door,

375
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,763
maybe give us
some private time?

376
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:17,633
It'll be your birthday gift
to me.

377
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:19,135
Oh!

378
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:21,704
It would be
my birthday gift to you

379
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:23,139
because it's your birthday.

380
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,274
Yeah, just
for, like, two hours.

381
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,542
Okay, one hour.

382
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:27,810
I'll skip the foreplay,

383
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,378
and that'll be
my birthday gift to myself.

384
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,946
[Laughs]

385
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:33,916
Cool, then I'll just
go do that, then.

386
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,751
I mean, Caroline
went to all this trouble

387
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:37,786
to get you a trip
for your birthday, I assume.

388
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:39,054
I know,

389
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:41,090
and I was really looking forward
to some birthday sex

390
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,858
since we haven't really
connected that way

391
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:45,094
since the shop started
giving you guys so much trouble.

392
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,263
But the shop's been
in trouble for weeks.

393
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:50,597
Yeah, so maybe I'll only need,
like, a half hour with her.

394
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,269
I need my book.
I'm gonna take a bath instead.

395
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,037
That tub is <i>so</i> amazing.

396
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:56,172
I'm just gonna soak in it

397
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:58,174
and blissfully
forget all my problems.

398
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:00,209
As well as some other things.

399
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,211
Max is gonna go visit
Yogi and Boo Boo next door

400
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:03,679
and give us some private time.

401
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
She can't do that.

402
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:05,981
It's their man-iversary.

403
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:07,449
They need their private time.

404
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,385
Yes, but you guys

405
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:12,288
are celebrating
a special thing, too.

406
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,190
What?
What are we celebrating?

407
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:16,225
Andy's birthday.
Oh, damn it!

408
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:18,994
Now, I went and spoiled
all the special sexual things

409
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:21,830
you had planned for him.

410
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:23,432
[Groans]
Damn it, Max!

411
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,534
Now, you <i>did</i> give it all away.

412
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,870
We were gonna do missionary,

413
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:29,404
and...

414
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:31,904
...the other one.

415
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,312
[Sighs]

416
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,812
Okay.

417
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,447
Okay, I'm sorry.
I forgot.

418
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:41,150
I don't know how.
I <i>knew</i> today was your birthday.

419
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,552
It's tomorrow.

420
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:45,054
So yippee!

421
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:46,288
She hasn't missed it.

422
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:47,623
All's right with the world.

423
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:48,724
[Laughs]

424
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:51,627
I'm gonna go visit
the berenstains.

425
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:54,029
This weekend wasn't
about my birthday, was it?

426
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,165
[Knocks at door]
Come on, come on.

427
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,633
Get your hand out
of his honeypot

428
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,502
and get over here.

429
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:01,804
I'll be gone in a second,

430
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:04,707
and then you guys can
jump-start your sex life again.

431
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,076
What do you mean
"jump-start"?

432
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:08,444
How could you tell Max

433
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:09,645
that we haven't had sex?

434
00:15:09,646 --> 00:15:11,447
You haven't even
discussed that with me.

435
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:12,615
Come on, aliens.

436
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:14,350
If you're ever going
to abduct me,

437
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:16,252
this would be the time.

438
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:17,786
Don't take the attention
off the fact

439
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,789
that you forgot my birthday.

440
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,591
Oh, God,
I wish I was a cartoon,

441
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:23,926
so I could run
right through this door,

442
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:27,260
and leave behind
a body-shaped hole.

443
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,530
- Oh, hey, Max.
- Hey.

444
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:29,531
Mind if I hibernate
for a minute?

445
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:30,833
Oh, sure, come on in.

446
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,735
We were just gonna eat
and then dye our chest hair.

447
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,737
[Laughs]

448
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:37,206
Close that damn door now.

449
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:38,974
Thanks, it was just getting
a little tense in there.

450
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:41,410
- She forgot his birthday.
- Mm, ouch.

451
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:42,711
Well, he forgot mine once,

452
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:45,381
and now it's his ankle tattoo.

453
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,082
Max, please, I insist.

454
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,250
You don't have
to ask me twice.

455
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,386
You gonna
eat the pretzel roll?

456
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,621
Andy, I'm sorry
about your birthday.

457
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:53,989
It just went out of my head.

458
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,157
I feel bad.

459
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:56,158
And I feel sick.

460
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,826
Can you stop swinging the bed?

461
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,828
Sorry, I'm nervous.

462
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:01,363
Yeah, you're nervous a lot,

463
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:03,666
which is why our other bed
isn't moving at all.

464
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:04,733
No, no, no, no, no, don't go.

465
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:06,935
Come back.
Come back to the sex bed.

466
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:08,203
Let's get some sex going!

467
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:10,839
Come on! We can
get this bed moving now!

468
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
See!

469
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,609
See?

470
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,445
Hey! Oh, hi!

471
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:19,281
Oh, it's your birthday!
It's your birthday!

472
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,849
It's tomorrow.

473
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,451
Okay.
Okay.

474
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:23,952
I can do better, see?

475
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:25,421
Here we go!

476
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:27,222
Now, here we go!

477
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:30,556
Wanna see me twerk it?
Oh!

478
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:35,564
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

479
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,466
If I'd had any food,
I would throw up.

480
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:38,934
Okay, yeah, have a seat.

481
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:40,636
Let's have some bread.

482
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:42,471
[Exhales]

483
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:45,074
Has it really been that long
since we had sex?

484
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,408
Sweetie, after that dance,

485
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,742
it's hard to believe
you've ever had sex.

486
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:52,181
It hasn't been <i>that</i> long.

487
00:16:52,182 --> 00:16:53,382
The shop opened on the 12th,

488
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:55,651
so it's...

489
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:57,419
What?

490
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,687
No, it's just interesting

491
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,889
you had no problem
remembering that date.

492
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,858
Let me ask you a question.

493
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:04,460
Where do you think
you're going?

494
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:05,694
What do you mean?
I'm here.

495
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:06,929
No.

496
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,163
Where do you think
you're going?

497
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:10,399
Like, where do you see
your life in a year?

498
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,134
Well, pretty soon, Max and I

499
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:13,369
will be out
of this rough patch,

500
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,536
and full force
with the business,

501
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:16,071
doing weddings and big events,

502
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:18,407
and then Max and I will
probably open another store,

503
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:19,475
get a bigger apartment.

504
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:22,411
Okay, and am I
in there somewhere?

505
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:24,847
Oh, come on.
I was getting to you.

506
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:26,048
Were you?

507
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,617
When? When were you
getting to me?

508
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:31,286
After your business
is a success?

509
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:32,488
No! Now.

510
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:35,491
Come on.
Sex time in the sex bed.

512
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,662
Wanna do it on the floor?

513
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,432
This is so comfortable!

514
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:49,638
You put a belt on this,
you could wear it out.

[Chuckles]

516
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:52,574
Just don't try that
at your in-laws' house

517
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:54,576
with a matching turban.

518
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:57,279
Dirk, my father
worked 40 years in the factory

519
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,647
before he lost his arm.

520
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:00,816
- He doesn't get "camp."
- Okay.

521
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:01,817
Now get up here, lady.

522
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:02,985
We're having cookies and milk.

523

You guys rock.

524
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:07,055
I promise I won't
stay here all night.

Don't wanna get trapped
in the middle

[Chuckling]

528
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:12,928
Please, honey.

529
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:14,730
You are perfectly safe
in this bed.

530
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:17,466
We haven't had sex in a year.

531
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:19,234
Why would you tell her that?

532
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,936
Well, she told us about
her friends not having sex.

533
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:22,371
I thought it was on the table.

534
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:24,406
But <i>we</i> haven't even
discussed that.

535
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:27,740
Mother ship, make it happen!

536
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:32,211
This is the time to abduct me.

537
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:35,884
Hi. Max, you can come back.
Andy left.

538
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:37,486
He said he'd find
his own way home.

539
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:40,820
- He left?
- Because you're not having sex?

540
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,725
Max, you told the bears
we're not having sex?

541
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:44,893
Why would you share that?

542
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:46,195
Exactly, Caroline.

543
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:47,930
And why would you
tell Max that,

544
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:50,165
when you never even brought
it up in our Gestalt therapy?

545
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,935
I was planning on addressing
it with you this weekend.

546
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:55,037
You think I'd spend $500
on this room

547
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:56,338
for milk and cookies?

548
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,140
I think we're all forgetting

549
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,209
how good that soup was.

550
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,477
Well, I'm sorry
if I haven't been feeling

551
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:02,678
very attractive lately.

552
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,180
I tell you how handsome
you are every day.

553
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:08,514
Don't you guys
look exactly alike?

554
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,053
Are you okay?

555
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:12,387
I'm all right.

556
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,556
You wanna get in bed
and cuddle for a little while?

557
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:16,158
No, it's--
yeah.

558
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,726
Come on.
Yeah, get in here.

559
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,995
There you go.
There you go.

560
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:22,064
Both: Whoo!

561
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,100
Oh, good.
You're alive.

562
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:26,735
When I heard you left
and walked through the woods,

563
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:30,069
I wondered,
"was there anal probing?"

564
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,609
By an alien, not a grifter.

565
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,943
You texted you wanted
to see me?

566
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:37,713
Well, someone did.

567
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:39,248
Happy Birthday!

568
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:40,415
Now, come on, blow.

569
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,017
I don't really
feel like doing that.

570
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:45,220
Welcome to our world.

571
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:49,458
Andy, I'm so sorry
about everything.

572
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:50,592
It's okay.

573
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:52,361
I had a lot of time
to think on the bus,

574
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,196
and the other bus,
and the bus I had to take

575
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:55,831
when that bus broke down.

576
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:57,065
If it makes you
feel any better,

577
00:19:57,066 --> 00:20:00,235
I have rope burns
all down my back.

578
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:02,905
Andy, I'm sorry
about your birthday.

579
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:04,406
We told each other
those dates a month ago.

580
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,375
I wouldn't expect you
to remember mine.

581
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:08,176
May 28th, 1987.

582
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:09,878
10:30 in the morning.

583
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:13,212
10:30 at night,
so you're not perfect.

584
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,851
Look, you have
a really busy life,

585
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:18,420
and you're really ambitious,
which I admire,

586
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,989
but I wanna be more than someone
you get to eventually.

587
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,357
And you deserve that.

588
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:24,526
It's just I have to put
the business first right now--

589
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:25,694
And I get that.

590
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:29,028
I just--I think we
should take a break.

591
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:30,699
You wanna take a break?

592
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,769
Maybe, yeah.

593
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,970
Are you saying take a break

594
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:36,038
'cause you really
mean "break up,"

595
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,606
but you're trying to be nice?

596
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:40,208
Maybe, yeah.

597
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,343
I'm sorry if this
seems sudden,

598
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:42,678
but I know me,

599
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:45,113
and maybe it's better sooner
than later.

600
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:46,882
I'm back!

601
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:48,450
And I brought my bridesmaids!

[Giggling]

603
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:53,088
Looks like business
is picking up.

604
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,057
It's gonna be hard
not to see you.

605
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:56,925
Yeah, it will be.

606
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:59,361
I work 10 feet away.

607
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:00,529
This way, ladies.

608
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,231
We're gonna taste
every cupcake they have!

609
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:05,934
This is the time to take me!

610
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:07,235
Come on, final offer!

611
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,271
E.T.? Alf?

612
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:11,406
Christina Ricci?
