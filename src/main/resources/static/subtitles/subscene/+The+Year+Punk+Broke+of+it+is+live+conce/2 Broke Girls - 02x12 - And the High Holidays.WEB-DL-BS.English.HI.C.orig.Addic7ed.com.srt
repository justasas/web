in our cupcake shop.

What?
You said it was a private party,

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,527
and this is a party
I keep near my privates.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,129
Fine, but they can't
smell it on your breath,

6
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:15,613
So eat a mint after.

7
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:17,649
No need.
It's peppermint Schnapps,

8
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,617
'cause I think ahead.

9
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,704

What's up, Andy?

40
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:48,191

she was doing with her hands.

hadn't paid your rent.

we just don't have--

Just tell him the truth.

We can't pay our rent,
life sucks,

set up for this month:
The <i>Quinceanera</i>

68
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:00,831
for that pregnant girl,
and then her baby shower.

69
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,666
Plus, the holidays
are coming,

70
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,768
so we should
get our decorations up asap,

71
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,403
or Santa won't know
where to find us.

72
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:07,938
Oh, he'll know
where to find us.

73
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,106
We'll be
the two evicted girls

out of a Dumpster.

one of the reindeers now.

We found the Grinch.

00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:29,693
No wonder it's so angry,
it's working for minimum wage.

80
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:35,999
Oh, you're hanging
the Christmas decorations.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,634
I already put up
the mistletoe.

82
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,902
Where?

83
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:42,236
Let's just say
it's very well-hung.

84
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,178
Well,
all my checks are in,

85
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,914
so I have to run
and make a cupcake delivery.

86
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,549
Here, take this
and put it in the till.

87
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,017
I did a cupcake run
last night too.

88
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,753
- Wait, who orders cupcakes
at 2:00 a.m.?

89
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,689
Um, my friends.

90
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,023
You don't have
any friends.

91
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:02,259
I have so many friends.

92
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,427
Who are your friends?

93
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:04,961
Some people I know.

94
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,363
Then how come
I've never met them?

95
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:08,532
Well, they don't like you.

96
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:09,966
But they don't know me.

97
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:12,436
They don't like
what they've heard about you.

98
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,805
But who would they have
heard things from but you?

99
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,973
Maybe from
my other group of friends.

100
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:19,043
They don't like you either.
Later.

101
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:24,848
Max, you can turn around.

102
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,284
That's right,
I followed you.

103
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:31,755
Sorry for following you.

104
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:33,724
It's just, you have
the hair and jacket of a woman.

105
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:36,159

think that was me?

My beard is much thicker.

108
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:41,398
Well, where are we going?

109
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,899
Why are we
in this seedy building

110
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,301
that smells
like marijuana?

111
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:47,037
Oh, my God, is this
where your mom lives?

112
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,340
You think
my mom lives indoors?

113
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:52,275
Okay, look,
for the last few nights,

114
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:54,544
my dealer calls me
after she sells pot to people,

115
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,713
and then I sell those people
the munchies they need.

116
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,049
Max, this is New York.
That's illegal!

117
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,551
No, giant sodas
are illegal.

118
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,887
This is me selling cupcakes
to make our rent.

119
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,822
And besides,
it's not a big deal.

120
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:07,758
Pot's legal in Washington,
Massachusetts,

121
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,259
Colorado, and California.

122
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,194
Well, thank you
for the stoner's summary

123
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,896

but we don't live

124

in any of those places,

125
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,166
and I do not approve of pot
at all.

126
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,868
It makes people
lazy and lethargic,

127
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,903
and drains
all one's ambitions.

God, you're fun.

129
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,674
Look, on the other side
of this door

130
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:27,677
is money to help us make
the $600 more we need for rent.

131
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:29,446
It's totally up to you.

132
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,848

or not knock?

Oh, thanks, but we actually
just had some dank nugs.

I don't want to rush you,

but me and dank nugs
have to get home.

How easy was that?

151
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,492
And we didn't even
have to open the shop.

152
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:17,394
I mean, what is the problem
with doing this?

153
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:19,129
You're right,
I overreacted.

154
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,298
We're not selling pot.
We're selling cupcakes.

155
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,532
We didn't break any laws.

165
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:45,155
I told you not to get involved
with drugs!

166
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,256
I told you!

167
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:49,326
- Shut it, Carol! Shut it!
- Oh!

168
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:55,799
I can't believe
that just happened.

169
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,133
I know, it's like,
"let it go, Carol."

170
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,572
We're done with drugs.
I was right.

171
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:05,642
And now you know
why my friends don't like you.

172
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,298
And remember,
we do private parties,

173
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,967
wedding parties,
birthday parties--

174
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,669
All right, there's a dozen.
What's the special occasion?

175
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,738
My cat died.

176
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:24,072
We also do funerals,
divorces...

177
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,845
And sad Friday nights alone.

178
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:30,715
[Mouthing words]
Thank you.

179
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,550
Okay, so that's
48 more dollars.

180
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:35,884
Now, all we need is--
For 72 more cats to die.

181
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,356
Max, there's no need
to kill imaginary cats.

182
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,024
Let's just send out
positive energy,

183
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,727
and the universe
will provide.

184
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,030
Swing and a miss, universe.

185
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,032
Surprise!
I was in the neighborhood

186
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,667
and thought I'd stop by
and say hello.

187
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,403
Under any other circumstance,
I'd say, "never do that again,"

188
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,906
but today, I'm saying,
"how many cupcakes do you want""

189
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,175
and I'm thinking of a number
between 10 and 20.

190
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,644
I'm kind of trying
to watch my waist.

191
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,747
Well, you're closer to it
than most people.

192
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:07,185
I'm gonna start you
with 12 cupcakes.

193
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,487
Full price,
'cause you're family.

194
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,521
[Phone ringing]

195
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,523
Oh, my God!
The phone ringing

196
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,192
and a customer
at the same time?

197
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,660
See, Max,
it's all happening.

198
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,261
Between the money
we just got last night

199
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:19,497
and that pregnant girl's
<i>Quinceanera</i> / Baby shower,

200
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,998
we're gonna make our rent.

201
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,968
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.
Oh, <i>hola,</i> Estella.

202
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,204
<i>Si,</i>
the <i>Quinceanera</i> / Baby shower.

203
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:28,272
<i>Que?</i>

204
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:31,606
Oh, no.
Deported?

205
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,812
Oh, you can't afford it.
[Chuckles]

206
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,118
My <i>mal.</i>

207
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,452
Well, sorry, it didn't work out.
<i>Gracias</i> for calling.

208
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:45,256
Well, that's disappointing,

209
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,457
but we should have
seen it coming.

210
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,791
She couldn't
afford condoms either.

211
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,395
It's cool.

212
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:52,630
I'll just call Keefer

213
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:54,098
and try to do
a couple more cupcake runs.

214
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,834
No, that's not cool,
that's dangerous.

215
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:59,003
It'll all work out.
You know what?

216
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,538
I'm just gonna go over
and ask Andy

217
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,907
if he'll float us some cash
till the holiday rush kicks in.

218
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:03,941
He did offer.

219
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:05,977
We should put up
some Christmas lights,

220
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,412
a menorah for Chanukah,
and for Kwanzaa...

221
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,746
While I'm gone, why don't you
Wikipedia Kwanzaa?

222
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:16,217
Well...
Here's the first eight.

223
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:18,156
And how many cupcakes
would you like "to go"?

224
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,525
I'm thinking of a number
between 40 and 50.

225
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,661
How come you never push
the food at the diner like this?

226
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:26,995
Oh, that's where
I know you from.

227
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,035
Start eating.

228
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,708
I didn't do it.
It's so not hot.

229
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,078
He's my boyfriend.
I mean,

230
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,847
it's not like borrowing money
from family.

231
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,216
You don't sleep
with your family.

232
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,550
Not all families
are the same, Caroline.

233
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:51,887
Besides, we're fine.
The universe will provide.

234
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,858
Well, the universe
better provide in,

235
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,393
like, a second, 'cause look,
there's the landlord.

236
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,328
He just went
into that Moroccan place.

237
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,329
What are we gonna do?

238
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,463
- Hide!
- What?

239
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,399
Well, I should go.

240
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,900
It's too late for that!

241
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,035
Lock the door, hit the lights,

242
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,304
and crawl over here,
and stay low!

243
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,573
Stay down
till we're out of sight.

244
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,574
Ow!

245
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,908
Ow. Ow, it hurts!

246
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,879
Oh, please.
Like this is the first time

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,315
you've been on your knees
in the bathroom.

248
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,517
Caroline, you don't have to
stay on the ground anymore.

249
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,086
I feel like
this is where I belong now.

250
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:24,989
[Keys jangling]
Yo, Baker girls.

251
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,324
Max, he's in the shop.

252
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,492
- Okay, go, out the window.
- Really?

253
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:30,228
If he can't see us,
he can't evict us.

254
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,331
Go.

255
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,967
It's a little high.
Are you sure?

256
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,136
You've heard "When God closes
a door, he opens a window"?

257
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:40,404
He's running
from his landlord.

258
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:41,607
Go.

259
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,476
Okay, here goes.
I love you, Max.

260
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,248
What about me?
What should I do?

261
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,017
Put the money for those
cupcakes on the counter.

262
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:58,856
Who are you?

263
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,140
Uh...

264
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:02,190
<i>No hablo ingles?</i>

265
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:07,476
All right, all right,
good news.

266
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:10,112
I just found $3
in my pocket.

267
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:11,781
Oh, and a peanut M&M,

268
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:13,949
so we don't have to
spend money on dinner.

269
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,951
Caroline,
why are you putting it off?

270
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,353
You know
what you have to do.

271
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,622
Go over to the couch and
put your hands in that crack.

272
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:22,458
It's every poor girl's
rite of passage.

273
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:25,461
Oh!

274
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:26,462
What?

275
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:28,732
I think something
just licked me.

276
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,568
I'll just check our purses.
Here's yours.

277
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:33,836
Uh, no, no, no.
I already checked that.

278
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:34,970
There's nothing in mine...

279
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,505
Except that baggie of pot

280
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:39,041
that Keefer gave me
as a Christmas present.

281
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,843
Max, this is not
a Christmas present.

282
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,612
This is a giant, illegal,
fat sack of weed.

283
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:46,315
Yeah,
with a Rudolph sticker,

284
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:48,250
which makes it
a Christmas present.

285
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:51,153
See?
His nose and his eyes are red.

286
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:54,487
I want this out of my sight.
You gotta get rid of it.

287
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,192
[Scoffs]
Well, it's gonna take me

288
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:58,727
at least 45 minutes
to smoke all that.

289
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,229
Max, I'm serious,

290
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,431
I'm not comfortable
with that fat sack of weed.

291
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:05,101
Stop saying
"fat sack of weed."

292
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:07,670
You're like someone's dad
overusing the word "awesome."

293
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:10,172
I'll just put it up here,

294
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:13,506
next to the half a Vicodin
I was saving for new year's.

295
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:15,544
[Screams]

296
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:17,446
Oh, no!
The pot!

297
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:18,814
The pot is in the pot!

298
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,350
It's in the butter
I was using to make cupcakes.

299
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:22,418
Maybe this is
the universe's way

300
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:24,420
of telling you
to stop doing drugs.

301
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:27,754
Or is it telling us
to sell them?

302
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:32,828
Max, we are
not that desperate.

303
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,263
We're not making
pot cupcakes.

304
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:36,365
I'd rather just see
what the holidays bring.

305
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:38,734
Well, this isn't Bethlehem,
it's Brooklyn.

306
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,503
There's no frankincense
and myrrh,

307
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:43,172
there's only frankenberry
and "myrrh-ajuana."

308
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,721
These turned out great!
Good idea, universe.

309
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:56,991
I knew you smoked weed.

310
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,394
Oh, my God.
I can't believe the smell.

311
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:02,563
It's like a skunk
skunked a skunk.

312
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,732
I know.
It's like a port-a-potty

313
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,868
on the last day
of Coachella.

314
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,470
Oh, no,
Chestnut's smelling this.

315
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:11,673
I got my horse stoned.

316
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,241
Oh, relax.

317
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:16,044
He's just trying
to fit in at school.

318
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,179
Do you think
the neighbors can smell it?

319
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,914
Do you think
they're gonna call the cops?

320
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,250
Chill out!
How can someone be this paranoid

321
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,919
before they're high?

322
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,087
Here, taste this.

323
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,455
Max, I don't do pot.

324
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,057
I tried it a couple times
in college.

325
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,858
It totally changed
my personality.

326
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:34,192
Then <i>please</i>
have some pot right now.

327
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:36,364
Come on, it's business.

328
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,066
I need you to taste it
and tell me how it is,

329
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,634
'cause I can't tell.
At this point,

330
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:42,003
everything I put in my mouth
tastes like pot.

331
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:46,806
Hey, it's pretty good.

332
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:51,209
In fact,
it's kind of delicious.

333
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:53,381
We should charge
15 apiece for these.

334
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:55,950
That's $540.
That's our rent.

335
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,552
A few more bites
of that cupcake,

336
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:59,887
and that math would've
taken two hours longer.

337
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:01,255
[Pounding at the door]

338
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,124
Oh, my God!
It's the cops!

339
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,059
It's probably
that same SWAT team!

340
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,894
I told you not to get involved
with drugs!

341
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:08,896
I told you!

342
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:12,230
Shut it, Caroline!
Shut it!

343
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,469
Relax, it's Sophie.

344
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,803
Hi, girls.
I got my period.

345
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:20,742
Yeah, I got killer cramps.

346
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:23,911
It's like I got a tractor
in my uterus.

347
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,880
Sophie, we're sorry
you're not feeling well.

348
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,482
Yeah, you know,
it's times like these

349
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,283
I think God's a bitch.

350
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:31,252
Ugh!

351
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:34,586
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

352
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:38,159
What's that smell?

353
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,494
Nothing.
It's nothing.

354
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:41,963
Maui wowie!

355
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,297
Oh, you girls
have been holding out on me!

356
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:49,668
Oh!
All right! Okay!

357
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,940
This is what
I'm talking about!

358
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:55,910
Oh, my God,
good-bye, killer cramps!

359
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,079
Hello, pot party!

360
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,413
I am picking up
what you are laying down.

361
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,651
Mmm!

362
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:08,386
I think we found
our new product spokesperson.

363
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:12,190
[Humming]

364
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:13,528
Here it is.

365
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,029
I've been here once before
with Keefer.

366
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,365
Judah's a really chill guy,
kind of a tech genius.

367
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:18,766
Think we can probably
sell them all here.

368
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:20,268
Are you okay?

369
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,537
You haven't spoken
the entire way over here,

370
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:23,871
which is either
a side effect of the pot,

371
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,973
or my early
Christmas present.

372
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:28,075
No, I'm fine.
I feel exactly the same.

373
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,777
It hasn't changed me
at all.

374
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,245
Ooh!
Careful with the box,

375
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,580
'cause you're smearing
the cupcakes.

376
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:35,416
Oh, what does it matter?
We're all gonna die.

377
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,453
Is this that other personality
you were telling me about?

378
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,521
No, it's still me.
Not that I matter.

379
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,790
None of us do.
We're all gonna die.

380
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,059
Oh, crap.

381
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,327
Hey, Max!

382
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,795
I was so happy
that you called.

383
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,298
And we're so happy
you're addicted to marijuana.

384
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,400
You know it always
leads to heroin--

385
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:53,634
Which leads to death.
We get it.

386
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:56,671
You're the one
not-fun stoner.

387
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,973
Hey, guys, the chicks
are here with the edibles.

388
00:15:58,974 --> 00:15:59,974
All: Edibles!
- We're having a little bit

389
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,175
of a celebration.

390
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:03,010
Okay, so cupcakes.

391
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:04,979
They're 15 apiece,
good quality.

392
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,248
And guys, we have to sell
all of them, or tomorrow,

393
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:09,851
we'll be eating
out of a Dumpster.

394
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,220
Does anyone
have any uppers?

395
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,554
I have to sit down.
I mean, life. Ugh!

396
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:17,892
I'm so tired of pretending
it's all gonna be okay.

397
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,627
It's not.

398
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,362
You should get that mole
checked out.

399
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:24,696
I don't feel good
about it.

400
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,400
Dude, this chick
is freaking me out.

401
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:29,036
Just take it easy, Dave.
We'll just get some food in her.

402
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:30,605
I got a buddy on the way
with pizza.

403
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,073
Guys, I'm sorry about her.

404
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,975
It's like bringing your mother
to a strip club.

405
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:36,043
Not for me. That'd be like
taking my mom to work.

406
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:37,478
[Laughs]

407
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,547
Strippers,
how about their lives?

408
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:40,948
They got no way out.

409
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:42,583
Can I talk to you,
before you start performing

410
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,753
an acoustic ballad
about strippers with moles?

411
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:51,225
What's the point, Max?

412
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:53,861
Go, if you're gonna hit me,
hit me.

413
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,329
What is happening
with you?

414
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,663
I didn't even know
blonde people could be sad.

415
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,134
Max, I have to tell you
something.

416
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,370
[Whispering] Come here.
It's a secret. Come here.

417
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:05,540
We're not gonna make it.

418
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,608
But you're the one
who's always telling me

419
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,843
everything's gonna be fine.

420
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:11,746
Yeah, I was lying.

421
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,515
[Knocking at the door]

422
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,217
Where's the weed,
homeslizzy?

423
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,319
[Chuckles]
Perfect timing, Andy.

424
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,222
These are the girls
who are selling edibles.

425
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,457
No, that's my girlfriend,
Caroline.

426
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:26,360
That sucks for you, dude.

427
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,432
What are you doing here?

428
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:38,270
She is really
getting the hang of that.

429
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,275
And around 4:00 a.m.,
you finally called me

430
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:44,278
from an IHOP in Greenpoint,
and I came and picked you up.

431
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,013
You were covered in syrup,
yelling,

432
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:49,083
"the Mayans were right!
The Mayans were right!"

433
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:52,687
There's my little stoner.

434
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:56,021
Andy, I don't get stoned.
It was just last night.

435
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:57,692
I know.
You told me all about it

436
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,260
when you called
at 4:00 a.m.

437
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:02,594
Sorry,
and I'm mortified to ask,

438
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,498
but did you and I
have phone sex?

439
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:07,832
That was you and me.

440
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,072
Stoned Caroline's got game.

441
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,474
Hey, Max told me
about the rent.

442
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,042
Why didn't you tell me
you guys needed help?

443
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:17,178
I guess I just
didn't want to have to admit

444
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,513
to you or to myself
that we're in real trouble.

445
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:22,847
Plus, being a charity instead
of a girlfriend is so not hot.

446
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:26,087
Uh, there is nothing
you can do that is not hot.

447
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,688
Oh, then whatever you do,
do not look at the video

448
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,157
Max has of me, rolling around
in the IHOP parking lot,

449
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:32,593
covered in syrup.
[Laughs]

450
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,595
I want you to have this.

451
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:37,632
Cash it, don't cash it.
Do whatever you want,

452
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,900
but just know that my success
doesn't mean anything

453
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,370
if I can't
share it with you.

454
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,071
Thank you.

455
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:47,405
Andy, that is so amazing,
and I really appreciate it,

456
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,143
but I can't take it.

457
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:50,811
Well, it's a win-win.

458
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:53,247
At least it got your hand
in my pants.

459
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:56,350
And remember,
if you ever need it, it's there.

460
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,786
I'm talking about my penis.
[Laughs]

461
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,492
Andy offered to pay our rent,
but I said no.

462
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:11,162
That is the whitest thing
I've ever heard.

463
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,300
It was really sweet
of him,

464
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:16,137
but I didn't want to take money
from a man I'm sleeping with.

465
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,005
Wait, are you telling me
there are women

466
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:21,339
who don't take money
from men they're sleeping with?

467
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,811
What's gonna happen, Max?

468
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:25,513
I don't know.

469
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:28,847
But we do have
Christmas decorations,

470
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:30,451
so let's put them up.

471
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:31,519
Wait a minute.

472
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,020
You're the one
pushing Christmas?

473
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:34,689
Who are you, me?

474
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,558
No, I still have
my dignity.

475
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,392
Speaking of Christmas,
here are the 21/2 wise men.

476
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,267
- What's up?
- Caroline called me last night.

477
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,302
Told me that you two
couldn't pay your rent,

478
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,037
that you were losing the shop.

479
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,371
That girl can talk.

480
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:57,311
She called me too, and said
you didn't have your rent,

481
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:59,980
and also that, for sure,
the rising waters of the ocean

482
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:03,314
will swallow us
and kill us all.

483
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,022
So we put together
what we had, and... here.

484
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:09,690
Consider it
an early Christmas gift

485
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:10,891
from all three of us...

486
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,661
Even though I gave 350,
Earl gave 100,

487
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:16,664
and he gave 50.

488
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,200
Thank you,
but we can't take it.

489
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:22,534
Yes, you can.
We're family.

490
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:25,439
500 whole dollars?

491
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,341
[Sobbing]
Thank you, guys.

492
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:30,344
<i>[Christmas Time is Here</i>
by Vince Guaraldi]

493
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:33,678
And we have
something special for you.

494
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,354
What makes it special?

495
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:43,688
The love
she puts into 'em, man.

496
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,863
You can smell the love
all around her.

497
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,869
Mmm.

498
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,939
You know, Max,
I think we're gonna make it.

499
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,075
I like
not-stoned Caroline.

500
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:02,576
We're gonna keep you
off the drugs.

501
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:04,478
You mean
because I'm more positive?

502
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,247
No, 'cause we may
have to sell your urine

503
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:09,250
for next month's rent, and
I'm gonna need that pee clean.

504
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:12,584
[Laughter]

505
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:17,925
