00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:04,559
Previously on 2 Broke Girls!

2
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,585
Sophie, this is
so generous of you

3
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,504
to offer to buy us dresses
for the gala,

4
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:33,422
but as much as my shoes
love being back

5
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:35,591
- in their place of birth...
- Oh, your shoes were born here?

6
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:39,387
Mine were born in China,
but I adopted them at payless.

7
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:41,013
Maybe we should
find something cheaper,

8
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,723
at one of
those consignment stores.

9
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:45,393
"Consignment stores"?

10
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:47,603
Come on,
what are we, gypsies?

11
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:51,399
This is big fancy ball.
We need ball gowns.

12
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,401
Never really been
a fan of balls.

13
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:55,027
In fact, always thought
they got in the way,

14
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,779
but here we are.

15
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:58,573
Well, we do have
to look amazing

16
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:00,616
if we're approaching
Martha Stewart with a cupcake,

17
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:02,410
so we'll find
a way to pay you back

18
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,912
and start by doing some
cleaning jobs for you for free.

19
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:08,916
No! Every year
I give money to charity,

20
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,376
and I like
you two girls

21
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:13,796
way more than the babies
with the broken smiles.

22
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:17,133
So don't worry.
I got plenty of cash.

23
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:19,719
Aww, a roll of hundreds.

24
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,930
Reminds me of my Christmas
stocking stuffers.

25
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,892
Yeah, this is fun day.

26
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:29,604
I'm like Richard Gere
and you're my two hookers.

27
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:31,105
Well, when you put it
like that,

28
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:33,774
I'm a little
more comfortable.

29
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:36,027
Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

30
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,946
Hi, how are you?
We don't have a lot of time.

31
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:40,573
We have to be
at work by 6:00.

32
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:42,783
Can you show us your best
formal spring couture?

33
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:46,078
Perhaps you ladies
might be more comfortable

34
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:47,580
down in ready-to-wear.

35
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,665
As I said,
we're in a bit of a rush.

36
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:51,751
We might move a little quicker
if you dropped the attitude

37
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,170
and picked up
some dresses.

38
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,381
Show her your wad.

39
00:02:57,381 --> 00:02:59,634
Let's look
at some dresses.

40
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,761
Yeah, and get us
some champagne,

41
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,055
like in the movies.

42
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:06,349
# The patron, own,
let's go get it on #

43
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:07,975
# the zone, own,
yes, I'm in the zone #

44
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,102
# is it two, three,
leave a good tip #

45
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:11,437
# I'm-a blow off my money
and don't give two...#

46
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:13,439
# I'm on the floor,
floor #

47
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,107
# I love to dance #

48
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,777
# so give me more, more #

49
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:18,819
# till I can't stand #

50
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,280
# get on the floor, floor #

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,823
# like it's your last chance #

52
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:25,117
# if you want more, more #

53
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:27,620
# then here I am #

54
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,666
# starships
were meant to fly #

55
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,586
# hands up
and touch the sky #

56
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:39,298
# can't stop,
'cause we're so high #

57
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:42,844
# let's do this
one more time #

58
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:47,306
# starships
were meant to fly #

59
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:50,726
# hands up
and touch the sky #

60
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:54,146
# let's do this
one last time #

61
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,648
# hands up #

62
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:58,526
# we're higher than
a mother...#

63
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:03,656
# #

64
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,658
# higher than a mother...#

65
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:07,326
# jump in my hoopty
hoopty hoop #

66
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:09,078
# I own that #

67
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:11,163
# and I ain't paying
my rent this month #

68
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:13,040
# I owe that #

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,042
# but... who you want
and... who you like #

70
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:17,003
# dance your life,
there's no end in sight #

71
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:19,547
# twinkle, twinkle,
little star #

72
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:21,507
# now, everybody,
let me hear you say #

73
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,219
# starships
were meant to fly #

74
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,764
# hands up
and touch the sky #

75
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:33,186
# starships
were meant to fly #

76
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:36,856
# hands up,
and touch the sky #

77
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:39,358
# let's do this
one more time #

78
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:41,944
# oh oh oh #

79
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:50,451
One, two.

80
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:53,496
Han, did you just go up
on your tiptoes like a big boy?

81
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:56,082
Well, I wasn't expecting
a photo opportunity.

82
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:58,292
And I left my tom cruise
man-heels at home.

83
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,877
Max, give him a break.

84
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:02,088
This is a man who was
too short to be a jockey.

85
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:03,214
Oleg, give me your camera.

86
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:04,716
I must approve picture.

87
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:06,467
We've taken it
three times already.

88
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:09,387
Han, if you want
a nip slip, just ask.

89
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:12,015
My dress is too pretty
for this conversation,

90
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:14,434
so I'm gonna go get the cupcake
from the refrigerator.

91
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:17,770
And I'm going to warm up
my new town car for the ladies.

92
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,189
New?

93
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,443
What is this, 2002?

94
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:24,986
I hope so,

95
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,405
then I will have chance
to meet you for first time

96
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,490
all over again.

97
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,411
Now this is not
professional driver talk.

98
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:36,414
Hey, fancy ball Buster,
what's your deal?

99
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:37,832
You told him to get
a dream and a drive,

100
00:05:37,832 --> 00:05:39,000
and he did.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,419
Max, I have two sore spots.

102
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,463
Trusting men and...

103
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:44,797
And here, where that
crazy Jamaican

104
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:47,258
wove my extensions
too tight.

105
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:49,260
I'm thinking I should wait
to put the cupcake

106
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,304
in the cupcake purse
till we get out of the car.

107
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:53,097
We want our beer batter
maple bacon cupcake

108
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:54,849
to represent
our cupcake business.

109
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:56,351
We have a new record.

110
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,646
She cupcake four times
in one speech.

111
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:02,440
We should go.
Upper East Side from Brooklyn

112
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,275
at this time of day
is crazy.

113
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:06,110
But we came in here
to show Earl.

114
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,320
Maybe Earl decided
not to come

115
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,821
since he had the night off.

116
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:10,948
Max, we really should
be there at the start.

117
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:13,576
That's prime Martha Stewart
stalking time.

118
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:14,952
You're right.
And Martha will probably

119
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:16,287
have to leave early
to get up to bake;

120
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:18,289
A little something
I knows about.

121
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,249
The only difference
between Martha and I

122
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:21,668
is she probably doesn't
have to worry about

123
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:23,127
waking up her roommate
who lives

124
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,420
four feet from the oven.

125
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:27,340
But otherwise, twinsies!

126
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:33,304
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

127
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:35,264
Earl, slow down,
your heart.

128
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,349
Sorry I'm late, ladies.

129
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,101
But if I run any faster,
the cops

130
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,978
tend to pull guns on me.

131
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,438
Got held up
at the florist shop,

132
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:44,607
but I made it.
Here you go, ladies.

133
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:47,568
Aww, Earl,
you got us flowers?

134
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:48,945
Wrist corsages.

135
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:50,279
I hope they're still
in style.

136
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,864
They're a classic, Earl.

137
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:53,366
Like you.

138
00:06:55,618 --> 00:06:59,414
Mmm, that was
worth the run.

139
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:00,540
Let's go, ladies.

140
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,501
Oleg is waiting
to drive you.

141
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,421
And you drive me crazy.

142
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:08,715
Yeah, yeah.
Tell it to the marines.

143
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,425
Here, Earl,
take my phone.

144
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:13,219
I can't fit it
in the purse with my cupcake.

145
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:15,430
Have the best time
in the world.

146
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,849
And say hello
to "huge" Jackman for me.

147
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,485
That is not a good sign.

148
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,071
That car is smoking harder
than Bob Marley

149
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:34,741
on a rasta holiday.

150
00:07:38,703 --> 00:07:41,497
Sophie, if my cousin Yuri
said he would be here

151
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:43,416
in half hour
with parts to fix,

152
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,376
he will be here
in half hour.

153
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:46,544
Actually, it's been
40 minutes.

154
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:48,463
Your cousin is like you.

155
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:51,841
- He takes too long to come.
- Oh, this is news.

156
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:54,677
Suddenly a woman
wants a man to finish fast.

157
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,137
Oh, please.

158
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:58,306
Sex is not
a carnival cruise.

159
00:07:58,306 --> 00:07:59,515
I'm a busy woman.

160
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:01,726
You get on,
you get off.

161
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,603
Can I get a hit off that?

162
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:05,688
We'll just have to wait,
I guess.

163
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,191
I mean, if I still lived
in Manhattan, I'd hail a cab.

164
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,651
But that's not gonna happen
out here in the boondocks!

165
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:12,487
Plus, even if we could
afford a cab,

166
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:14,864
we'd be stuck forever
in rush hour gridlock.

167
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,199
Could you take it down
a notch?

168
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,492
Hipsters are starting
to look at us

169
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,410
like we're trying too hard.

170
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,953
Where did han go?

171
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,538
He said he might
have a plan.

172
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:25,583
Oh, my lord and Taylor!

173
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:40,098
That little mother
can ride.

174
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:50,191
You two look like
two princesses in a fairy tale.

175
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:51,693
Are you feeling safe?

176
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:53,111
I couldn't feel any safer

177
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:55,571
if we were riding
a rubber into town.

178
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,115
Here we go.
Bye, guys.

179
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:00,201
- Bye.
- Go, Chestnut!

180
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,422
Oh, check it out.
You see what I see?

181
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:14,090
Hello, officers.

182
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,633
We're on way to the ball
down the street,

183
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:16,926
and we were wondering
if we could please leave

184
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:18,594
our horse with your horses?

185
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:19,929
And I can save you
the time

186
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,264
on the breathalyzer test;

187
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:22,932
No, we are not drunk

188
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:25,059
or on some bachelorette
party scavenger hunt.

189
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,436
Our car broke down
in Brooklyn,

190
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,229
so we rode over
the Brooklyn bridge and up.

191
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:30,898
You rode a horse
across the Brooklyn bridge?

192
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,900
That's badass.

193
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,153
Yes...
And illegal.

194
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:37,488
In that case,
we took the tunnel.

195
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:40,074
Well, I think we can help
you two ladies.

196
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,243
Not gonna happen, Dave.
We're on duty.

197
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:44,203
Officers, we're already
a little late.

198
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:45,913
And with all due respect,
we don't have time

199
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:47,498
to play good cop,
bad cop.

200
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:50,918
Or in your cases,
hot cop, hot cop.

201
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:53,713
Well, I think we can help
you ladies.

202
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:55,256
Let's get you down
off of there.

203
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:57,800
I got the one
in the low-cut.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,046
Thanks officer hot
and officer hotter.

205
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,900
Max, I'm really impressed
with how well

206
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,694
you're maneuvering around
in that long skirt.

207
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:12,822
Yeah, I was a serving wench
at a medieval times restaurant.

208
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,365
It's a breeze
when I'm not carrying

209
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:17,660
a tray loaded
with Turkey legs and ale.

210
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,495
There's the "will call"
table.

211
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,372
Walk in front
and I'll hide behind you,

212
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,916
as I'm the most hated woman
in New York.

213
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,626
So basically,
I'm a human shield?

214
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,671
Well, you have more up here
to stop anything.

215
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,340
- Max!
- What?

216
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,550
Did someone pull a gun?

217
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,302
I knew that
was gonna happen.

218
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,053
No, I screamed because
I saw the couple

219
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,307
whose sworn statement
put my father in prison.

220
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:40,641
Max!

221
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,976
Acid in your pretty face?

222
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,686
Sorry, I stayed up
all night reading

223
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,980
what people want to do
to you in your hate mail.

224
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,815
What was it?

225
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,693
I went down so fast,
I may have smeared my cupcake.

226
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:53,779
That's the filthiest sounding
clean thing I ever heard.

227
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,698
It's fine. Good.

228
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,742
Now let's go get those cheap
plastic security bracelets

229
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:01,412
that ruin
our expensive gowns.

230
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,331
- Can I get your name?
- Caroline...

231
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,582
Channing.

232
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,875
I'm sorry, what?

233
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:06,876
Caroline...

234
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,503
Channing.

235
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:10,171
What's with you?
Just say your name.

236
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,547
Channing.

237
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,509
Did you say channing?
Caroline channing?

238
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,637
Wait, are you
<i>that</i> Caroline channing?

239
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,431
Shh, yes, and I personally
called the R.S.V.P. number.

240
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,724
It has to be there.

241
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:24,310
Channing,
channing, channing...

242
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,479
No, I don't see
"Caroline channing."

243
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,606
Shh.
Maybe it's under my name.

244
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,399
Max black.
I'm with her.

245
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,945
Black... no, no, no,
I don't see any blacks here.

246
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:36,948
You mean besides
the ones working security?

247
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:40,243
Let me check with Paul Platt,
the party planner.

248
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:41,702
He's on the phone
with him right now.

249
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,248
Hey, Brody.
Both: Oh, no.

250
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:47,834
There's a problem
with the list.

251
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,919
She's not on it.
Her.

252
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,088
- Caroline channing.
- Sh

253
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:53,422
Paul, I've got
Caroline channing,

254
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,966
and she's not on the list.

255
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:58,177
If everybody in this line
could just wait until

256
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,889
we get the Caroline channing
situation under control...

257
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,475
If you say "channing"
one more time,

258
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,727
I'm going to actually
pull your voice box out.

259
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,188
And its s so much
more violent than it sounds.

260
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,690
Yes, Paul,
I'll tell them.

261
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,024
There's been
a little mix-up.

262
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,484
Five more minutes
will get you right in.

263
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:17,029
You're not getting in.

264
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,116
Well, that's it.
We tried.

265
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:21,826
- We gave it our best shot.
- Oh, no.

266
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,703
This is the closest
I have ever gotten

267
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:26,122
to anything in my life
almost working out.

268
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:28,666
- We are not giving up.
- How are we getting in?

269
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,294
- Security's everywhere.
- Yeah, out here,

270
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:32,753
but not
at the servers' entrance.

271
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,380
I catered this
last year.

272
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,132
That's right,
we're going backdoor.

273
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:39,552
Ooh!

274
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,889
That lady
just punched me.

275
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:46,058
I knew
that was gonna happen!

276
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:55,943
So you can
just walk in here?

277
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,904
Anyone can
just walk right in?

278
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:59,572
Well, it helps
that last year

279
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,157
I made out with
the tent flap guard, Rico,

280
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:03,117
but basically,
yeah, anyone.

281
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,660
When I think
of all the times

282
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,579
I left my purse
on a table here unattended,

283
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:09,373
I shudder...
Shudder.

284
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,834
Okay, so we can't
get in the actual building

285
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,336
without being caterers,

286
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,629
so we have to change
into those uniforms.

287
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:15,963
Wait.

288
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,089
You never mentioned
anything about

289
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,633
a rent-a-clothes
situation.

290
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:21,344
Small price to pay
for us making it.

291
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:25,932
Is it? Is it
a <i>small</i> price to pay?

292
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:30,937
Hurry, we have
a superstar to stalk!

293
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,189
I thought I would hate it,
but I'm kind of into it.

294
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,857
I'm very Janelle Monae.

295
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,568
No, you're Janelle
I-have-no-Monae.

296
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,612
What are we going to do
with our dresses?

297
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,447
We can't leave them out here.
I need them inside.

298
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,407
I have to look amazing
when I meet Martha Stewart.

299
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,243
What does it matter
what we're wearing?

300
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:46,827
We're still going to be
the two crazy girls

301
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,871
chasing her down
with a cupcake.

302
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,332
- That's why it matters.
- Oh, ooh!

303
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:52,750
I know.
Here.

304
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,085
Help me get
the shelves out of this.

305
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:55,336
We can hang
our dresses in here

306
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,213
and push them in.
Brilliant.

307
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,507
Kind of like the Louis Vuitton
travel wardrobe I used to have.

308
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:03,344
Or the service elevator
I was born in.

309
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:06,889
Coming through, hot food.

310
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,766
Look out, very hot!
Man, it's hot.

311
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,017
You're a waiter,
not a weatherman.

312
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,644
Hey, pretty girls,

313
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,980
I like the way you push around
that big steel box

314
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,275
why don't you come over here
and I'll have sex with you?

315
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:20,444
A display like that
really makes you appreciate

316
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,280
oleg's nuanced wit.

317
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:27,034
Okay, let's go right
to the ladies room

318
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,286
so we can change.

319
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,038
Is it that way
or that way?

320
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,164
What?

321
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,583
Shh, Johnny!

322
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,751
How'd he get invited?

323
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,795
This used to be
an exclusive event.

324
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,088
He's "made it,"

325
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,798
he goes where
"made it" people go.

326
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,758
Why are we hiding
from that lowlife?

327
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,428
If he sees me
in another waiter uniform,

328
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:47,430
I'm the sad girl
always in the uniform.

329
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,182
If he sees me
in that dress at the ball,

330
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:50,224
he can suck it.

331
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:54,145
Ladies room, that way.

332
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:00,318
The ladies room
is right down here.

333
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:03,821
Push harder. Harder!

334
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:06,032
Do you want Martha
to see you dressed like that?

335
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,533
- Move! Coming through!
- Excuse us.

336
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,911
Food emergency.

337
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:11,245
Fingers, fingers,
fingers, fingers.

338
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,747
Coming through,
coming through.

339
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:13,998
- Excuse us.
- Look alive, red!

340
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,501
- I almost hit you.
- Hold up.

341
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,461
Now just hold up.
What is going on right now?

342
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:20,004
You can't bring
food in here.

343
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,173
Oh, it's not food.
That would be weird.

344
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,509
It's dresses.
We have to change into these,

345
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:25,968
'cause she has this guy
she wants to impress,

346
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,386
and I have to change
into it

347
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,222
because I'm stalking
Martha Stewart.

348
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:31,974
Ooh, I'd be
a terrible spy.

349
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,351
Usually I don't get
the long stories

350
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:34,644
till the end of the night,

351
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:36,103
and by then,
the girls are crying

352
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,689
and begging me
for Wisdom and tic tacs.

353
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,066
I'll go first.

354
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,609
I have to get two of these
in one dress.

355
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,528
Miss, do you have
a shoehorn?

356
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,204
Come on,
chanel shoes!

357
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,499
Come on,
chanel knockoffs.

358
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,708
Why are you
not dressed yet?

359
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,919
'Cause ladies take forever.

360
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,963
It's all the spanx.

361
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,715
Well, go, use my stall.
I want to go stick my head out,

362
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,177
and see if I
can scope out Johnny.

363
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,304
No, ma'am, no!
Not fair, ma'am.

364
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,265
Try the handicapper.
This side.

365
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,559
Good idea.

366
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,563
I cannot
get a break tonight.

367
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,235
- Psst, yo, Max.
- Johnny!

368
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,153
Who are you looking for?

369
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,197
The Dominos guy.

370
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,782
I was hiding in there,
'cause five more minutes,

371
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,409
the pizza's free.

372
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,536
I was hoping
I'd run into you.

373
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,912
Eh, no big deal.

374
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,956
Pretty big deal.
You look amazing.

375
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:42,043
Amazing. I will go
as far as amaze-balls.

376
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,670
Thanks.

377
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,046
You look like a guy
in a commercial

378
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,799
who has a ring and puppy
hidden somewhere.

379
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,467
Can you believe it?

380
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,261
We're both
at this shmancy thing.

381
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,762
Look how far we've gotten.

382
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,223
Actually,
when you think about it,

383
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:59,477
we didn't get
very far at all.

384
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,396
Nope, you're right.
We didn't.

385
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,525
Yeah, why?

386
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,694
Timing, I guess.

387
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,739
Timing?

388
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,157
Okay, whatever.

389
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,452
You know, from now on,
when I think of you,

390
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,747
I'm gonna think of you in this
and not the uniform.

391
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,917
You know,
from now on,

392
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,837
maybe you shouldn't
think of me at all.

393
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,464
Gotta go,
Mr. Manhattan.

394
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,845
That was awesome!
Caroline, where are you?

395
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,263
I'm almost dressed.

396
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,933
I just had the perfect
in-your-face good-bye

397
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,184
with Johnny.

398
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,645
And speaking of
"in your face,"

399
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,939
he couldn't take his eyes
off my boobs...

400
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,857
Boobs that
he can never have,

401
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:49,194
now that
he's getting married.

402
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,865
Damn, girl, you look good.
What you doing later?

403
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:59,412
Can I get your number?

404
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,041
Oh, no, the cupcake got
a little smushed in my purse.

405
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,710
We can't show this
to Martha Stewart now.

406
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,295
Sure, we can.

407
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,463
You think she never
had a cupcake smush on her?

408
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,131
I doubt that very much.

409
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,967
Martha Stewart
is perfect.

410
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,844
Her feet don't even
touch the ground.

411
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,762
The woman probably doesn't
even go to the bathroom.

412
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,726
Martha Stewart's
hardly perfect.

413
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,854
And how are you
this evening?

414
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,064
No, you're right,
Martha Stewart isn't perfect.

415
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,316
Oh, I never said that!

416
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,987
In fact, I hear
she's a real ballbuster.

417
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,321
You did not hear that.

418
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,282
Yep, a real ballbuster,
you know?

419
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,908
No, I do not know.

420
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:42,080
Would you mind handing me
a towelette please?

421
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,332
Oh, one's fine.
Thank you so much.

422
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,668
But the fact that Martha
Stewart <i>is</i> so tough...

423
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,628
Caroline, you need
to get out here right now.

424
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,923
The fact that she
is a real ballbuster...

425
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,758
Oh, dear God, help me.

426
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,427
Is what I like
and respect about her.

427
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,095
I mean,
the woman's a genius.

428
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,598
Now it's getting
interesting.

429
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,016
And besides, you can't
really believe gossip.

430
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,309
Look at all
that hate mail I got

431
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,019
with people
calling me a bitch,

432
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,520
and I'm not a bitch.

433
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,981
Well, that's debatable.

434
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,234
- Martha Stewart, hi.
- Hello.

435
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,778
I'm Caroline, and this is
my business partner, Max,

436
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,488
and we have
a start-up cupcake business.

437
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,366
Dude, are you serious?
You're still going for it.

438
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,993
I know this is
highly inappropriate,

439
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,536
but we brought
a cupcake here tonight

440
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,038
in hopes that
you might taste it.

441
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,290
So you want me
to taste your cupcake

442
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,791
in the ladies room.

443
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,044
What's inappropriate
about that?

444
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,505
We're a start-up business.
We've got to take risks.

445
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,881
This is Max.
She's the baker.

446
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,257
You're the baker.

447
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,510
I'm the baker.

448
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,136
Hm, it looks
quite appealing.

449
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,514
Oh, my God.

450
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,098
I know this
is a social event,

451
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,309
so I'm so sorry
for making it about business.

452
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,685
When you're in business
for yourself,

453
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,479
you have
to take every situation

454
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,314
as a business opportunity.

455
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:53,235
Look, I have
five of these in here.

456
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,238
I love your magazine.

457
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,114
I read every single issue

458
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,409
until they realized I didn't
even go to that doctor.

459
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,370
Well, in spite
of the fact

460
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,413
that you have not
yet washed your hands...

461
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,374
I was just changing
my dress in there.

462
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,334
- I'll taste it.
- You will?

463
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,962
I like
your entrepreneurial drive.

464
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,172
And I have a feeling
that it's actually

465
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,383
the only way I'm gonna
get out of here alive.

466
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:21,054
That is our beer batter maple
bacon spring break cupcake.

467
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,682
- Hm, clever name.
- Thank you.

468
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,350
It is a little smushed,
though. That's unfortunate.

469
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,020
I told you.

470
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,400
Mmm.
Quiet tasty.

471
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,735
I like it.

472
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,238
Do you girls have a card?

473
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,033
Get it out, get it out,
get it out.

474
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,870
Ah, thank you very much.

475
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,330
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

476
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,250
Well, you know who'd
really like that cupcake?

477
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,377
Stoners.

478
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,132
She said
"Max's homemade cupcakes."

479
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:00,468
Both: Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

480
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:04,097
Martha Stewart
likes our cupcakes!

481
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:11,396
