00:00:01,883 --> 00:00:02,851
Hi, I'm gonna be your waitress

00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:04,851
'cause my mother drank.

3
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:07,601
We need a sec.

00:00:07,603 --> 00:00:10,604
Feelin' kinda generous,
take two.

5
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:13,707
Then he said to me,
"Dude, your vagina is weird."

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:14,941
Dude, that's insane.

7
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:15,976
It is so not weird.

8
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:17,711
Your vagina's awesome.

00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,079
Okay, I'm ready.

10
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:21,581
Now I need a sec.

11
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,849
Well, it's over.

12
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:24,217
I can't say it any more.

The vagina's gone mainstream.

What's next?
A clothing line at target?

00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:31,191
Aw, Max, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:32,726
It's your favorite word.

17
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:34,461
And my favorite body part.

18
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:35,829
But now everyone's saying it.

Well, we can
pick another word for it.

20
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:39,499
Something cute, like cookie.

21
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,134
Yeah, it sounds like
a good idea

22
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:42,903

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,371
Oh. Oh.

183
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:49,805
It happened.

184
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,241
I split my spanx.

00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:03,507
Martha Stewart, please.

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,927
It's Michelle Obama.

00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,395
What's this about?

188
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:12,500
My sheets shrunk
and I am pissed.

Hello?

with a busted muffin tin,

00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:22,109
or Alicia keys
with a wonky shower curtain.

193
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,011
And it really didn't work
when you were

on her panini press.

This morning you used toilet
paper as a coffee filter...

And then used it
as toilet paper.

I know this
sounds silly to you,

232
00:08:47,496 --> 00:08:48,729

233
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:50,130
putting on these pearls
every day

234
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:52,433

confident,

she liked them,

send Martha an email,

standing in her office,

The only restaurant trade
I'm interested in

is if we can exchange you
for anybody else.

and get the cupcake.

what I'm saying is,

are taking over.

to Martha Stewart

and demand a damn blurb,

332

with the machines...

for never telling me
that our former plan was magic.

340

We'll just reintroduce
ourselves and our cupcakes

341
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,196
to Martha and impress her
all over again,

a necklace that I hate.

Ugh, no!

364
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,341

and she did.

00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:06,720
She was very gracious.

405

Yeah, maybe cornered
was the wrong word.

kind of a problem.

Martha came on to me.

All right. Okay.

414

This is not going as well
as we had hoped.

415

without my magic pearls.

536
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,393
and I have possible U.T.I.

537
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,064
Sophie...

538
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,900
Why don't you just admit it,
you and Oleg?

539
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:48,135
What?

540
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,870
It's not like I want him.

541
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,872
It's just that
where I come from,

542
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,174
you never throw anything away.

543
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,611
Here you go, ladies.

544
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,314
Enjoy the extra tips
from your credit cards,

545
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:02,649
because when Han
flips that switch,

546
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:04,451
the only tip
I can give you is,

547
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,620
don't wash your hair
every day.

548
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,989
It dries it out.

549
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:11,925
Okay.
Here comes the future.

550
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:14,661
One, two--

551
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:17,297
[electricity crackles]

552
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,465
[Sighs]

553
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,535
This old building
sucks me so hard.

554
00:20:22,637 --> 00:20:24,304
Congratulations, ladies.

555
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,573
This is your lucky night.

556
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,675
Speaking of luck,

557
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,410
here are your pearls.

558
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,412
I found most of them,
but I think

559
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:33,513
Chestnut ate a few.

560
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,048
You can dig for those
later yourself.

561
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,416
Max.

562
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:37,884
And it won't look the same,

563
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:39,920
because you have to string them
on this cheap-ass wire

564
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:41,989
I got at the hipster
bead store...

565
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,925
Beading Off.

566
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,660
We can add this
Earl bonus money

567
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,928
to our cupcake business total.

568
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,963
Yeah, that 150
will really put a dent

569
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,898
in the 250,000 we need.

570
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,000
We'll get there, Max.

571
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,468
Because you and
I have something

572
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,370
Martha Stewart
and machines don't.

573
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:57,504
Unpaid bills?

574
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,606
Mushrooms growing
on our bathroom rug?

575
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,541
No, each other.

576
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,543
Aww, a year later you're still

577
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:06,446
trying to get me
to feel things.

578
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:07,714
Do you wanna know
the real reason

579
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,850
I thought this necklace
was so lucky?

580
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:13,286
I was wearing it
the day I met you.

581
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:14,821
So, I'm gonna have some extras

582
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,390
do you wanna
make one for yourself?

583
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:18,225
Nah, I've had
plenty of pearl necklaces,

584
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:21,228
and I find them
more sticky than lucky.

585
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,397
[Cell phone chimes]

586
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:26,833
Max,
ms@marthastewartinc.com.

587
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:29,136
"Haven't forgotten
about you, girls.

588
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:30,637
Martha Stewart."

589
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:32,406
Just when I thought I was out,

590
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:35,342
she pulls me back in again.
