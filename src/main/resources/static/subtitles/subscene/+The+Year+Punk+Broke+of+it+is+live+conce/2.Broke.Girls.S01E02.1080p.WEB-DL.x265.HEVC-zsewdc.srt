1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,826
Hi, ready to order?

2
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:06,744
Do you have anything
that's really special?

3
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:09,998
Not according to my
high school guidance counselor.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,866
I'll have the veggie plate.

5
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:13,835
But instead of beets,
I want kale.

6
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:16,337
And instead of broccoli,
more kale.

7
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:18,339
I want the veggies steamed.

8
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:20,074
And instead of dressing,
I want lemons.

9
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:22,010
Don't you need
to write this down?

10
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:23,845
I'm afraid if I start
writing that down,

11
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:27,131
it'll turn into a suicide note.

12
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,550
I'm assuming
this table's gonna have

13
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:30,185
a lot more of those requests.

14
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:33,221
Yes, I could tell by the hats.

15
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:46,401
Earl, I have something new
I want you to try.

16
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,319
That's the exact same sentence

17
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:51,272
that got me hooked
on cocaine in the '80s.

18
00:00:51,274 --> 00:00:53,708
It's my new cupcake flavor.

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,295
Delicious dark chocolate
the ladies can't help but love.

20
00:00:57,297 --> 00:00:59,497
I'm calling it
"The Earl."

21
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:02,383
I know you got that right.

22
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:03,635
Hi, I'm here.

23
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:05,786
I was running late
so I decided to hail a cab.

24
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:07,955
And then I remembered I didn't
have any money on me.

25
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:10,341
And then I remembered
I didn't have any money at all.

26
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:13,011
So I walked the whole way here.

27
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:15,263
The apartment's
three blocks away.

28
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:16,314
Yes, I know.

29
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:18,799
Three blocks
and 15 "Hola chicas" away.

30
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:21,352
Well, you can't be late again.

31
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:23,271
I'm already worried
about me being late...

32
00:01:23,273 --> 00:01:25,473
every month.

33
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:28,526
On my way here, a homeless man
asked me for money.

34
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:30,945
And I told him
that I usually always give,

35
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,414
but that my father was indicted
in a Ponzi scandal

36
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,417
and I've lost my family fortune
and my Manhattan townhouse,

37
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:38,819
so I've been sleeping
on a couch in Brooklyn,

38
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,788
but, in spite of it all,
I'm still optimistic

39
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,540
that you and I
will achieve success

40
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:45,326
in our exciting new cupcake
business venture.

41
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,884
I prefer to think
of Bob near the bridge

42
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:54,469
as our first investor.

43
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:57,355
Pickup!
Special sandwich.

44
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:59,724
I can think
of even more special sandwich.

45
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:04,362
You, me
and the hot blonde giraffe.

46
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:07,031
Well, she recently
lost her dignity,

47
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,666
so you might have a shot.

48
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:11,736
Hello today!

49
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:13,404
I have nametag for you.

50
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:16,374
Only your second day
and look, nametag already.

51
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,993
As new owner, I am killing it.

52
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:20,027
Thank you.

53
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:21,462
Oh, it says "Carolin."

54
00:02:21,464 --> 00:02:23,414
It's Caroline.
With an "E."

55
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,199
I'm Caroline.

56
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:27,719
As new owner, I am sucking it.

57
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,704
Just put it on.

58
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:31,389
You can't tell an Asian
he made a mistake.

59
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:34,359
He'll go in the back
and throw himself on a sword.

60
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,010
Thank you,
Mr. Lee.

61
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:37,395
You may call me Han.

62
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:39,013
H-a-n.

63
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:40,932
No trap in my name.

64
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:43,234
I'm thinking we should take

65
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:45,486
the first step
in our new cupcake business

66
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:47,555
by writing
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes"

67
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:48,890
up on the specials board.

68
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,558
No, I can't have
my name up there.

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,745
Everyone I owe money to
thinks I live in Seattle.

70
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:57,999
Oh, we used to own Seattle.

71
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,251
Max, we've got to get
the name out there.

72
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:01,285
Create a buzz.

73
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:02,370
Ooh, good idea!

74
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:03,287
Let's create a buzz.

75
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,555
Exactly,
in order to launch--

76
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:07,041
I'm mocking you.

77
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,926
When in doubt,
I'm always mocking you.

78
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,428
Seriously, Max.

79
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,797
This new cupcake business
is our lifeline.

80
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,549
A way out for both of us.

81
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:17,552
And I wanna thank you again
for letting me move in.

82
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:19,804
If there's anything
I can do to help you--

83
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:22,473
You mean besides
starting to wait on tables?

84
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:23,891
I meant, anything I can do

85
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:26,527
to help you through
your breakup with Robbie.

86
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:29,947
Oh. Thanks,
but I'm fine.

87
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,015
And we're working.

88
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:33,401
Well, one of us is.

89
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,253
Are you sure you're fine?

90
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:37,455
'Cause I heard you
crying last night.

91
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:38,790
I don't cry.

92
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:43,294
I sold my tear ducts to an organ
bank for cash two years ago.

93
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:44,862
I was on the couch.

94
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:47,715
And I heard you crying alone
in your bedroom.

95
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:50,551
Really?
What did the crying sound like?

96
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:55,807
Like...

97
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,676
I wasn't crying.

98
00:03:58,678 --> 00:03:59,894
Well, then what
were you d--

99
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:03,464
Oh! So none of
my business.

100
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,933
That's right.
And remember that.

101
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:07,301
Got it.

102
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:08,603
In fact, let's just say
that anything having to do

103
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:11,489
with my bedroom, my tables,
or my life--

104
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:12,573
you should stay away from.

105
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:13,974
Boundaries.
Got it.

106
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:17,645
And please
don't tell anyone at work

107
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,147
I let you move
into my apartment.

108
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,649
That is one boundary
we both don't want crossed.

109
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:23,618
Why?

110
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,620
Hey, roomies.

111
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:27,805
That's why.

112
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:35,384
Hope those sheets are okay.

113
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,626
Oh, don't worry about it.

114
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:38,161
I know they're the best
you could afford.

115
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,946
Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.

116
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,198
Max, that oven is so hot.

117
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,517
Could you do me a favor
and open the back door?

118
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,618
We've known each other two days

119
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,020
and you're already
asking for back door?

120
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,463
Dear God!

121
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,799
I forgot
you're Equestrian Barbie.

122
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,485
You came with a horse.

123
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:06,304
No.

124
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,206
Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.

125
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:15,096
Chestnut.

126
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:18,482
No need to yell,
he's a champion.

127
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,434
Champion stink bomb.

128
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,520
It's smelling pretty ripe
out in that yard.

129
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,656
That's not Chestnut,
that's Brooklyn.

130
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,058
Okay, well, I'm watching
"The Champion"

131
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,364
drop some steaming hot
"Brooklyn" right now.

132
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,484
Max, I've been thinking about
how you completely overreacted

133
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:38,502
to your name
up on the specials board.

134
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,538
Do you think it's
a fear of success?

135
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,091
I am too poor
to have a fear of success.

136
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,710
At Wharton Business School,
we learned

137
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,179
that every new venture can bring
up a certain amount of fear.

138
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,348
Is there any way
to do a yelp review

139
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,633
of Wharton Business School?

140
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:55,970
Maybe you're having
a hard time imagining

141
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,938
this cupcake business
could ever even happen

142
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,275
because nobody ever believed
in you or your dreams.

143
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,510
I'm guessing.

144
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:05,429
I can make this happen, Max.

145
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,765
For me, for you, for us.

146
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,900
Just keep making
those amazing cupcakes.

147
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,603
And I'll do the rest
till you believe.

148
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,071
I believe
everything you just said

149
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,291
and that children
are the future.

150
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,546
Max, it's me!

151
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:41,632
I know it's you.

152
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,651
You sleep with a knife
under your pillow?

153
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,938
It's the only home security
system I can afford.

154
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,140
And I'm a cutter.

155
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:52,827
I can't sleep on that couch.

156
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,997
I think Ikea might be the
Scandinavian word for sciatica.

157
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,483
And there's weird sounds
in the street.

158
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,836
And I don't have
my white noise machine.

159
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,454
Well, that's
Puerto Rican noise.

160
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,655
You'll get used to it.

161
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,925
Can I just lay down here
and get a little sleep?

162
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,845
I don't even let the men
I sleep with sleep with me.

163
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,597
I can't get into
your issues right now.

164
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,633
I just need to sleep!

165
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,270
Fine, get in then.

166
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,805
What is that?

167
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:24,442
Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.

168
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,927
Cool ranch and bacon?

169
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:29,012
Dude, they're delicious.

170
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,115
Because of your breakup
with Robbie?

171
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,399
Just get in.

172
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:35,653
I have to be in the city
to babysit in five hours.

173
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,526
Oh, great,
you're like a nightlight.

174
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:47,298
You're so blonde.

175
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,000
Thank you.

176
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,723
Max, someone's
in the living room.

177
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,392
Max, someone's in the bedroom!

178
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,810
Robbie!

179
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,612
What's up, babe?

180
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,314
Robbie, what are you
doing here?

181
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,715
We broke up.

182
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,684
Still?

183
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,569
Yes, still.
You hit on me.

184
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,321
And then she caught you
with someone else

185
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,722
in these very sheets.

186
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,608
Which I'm hoping she washed.

187
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,826
Oh, I get it.

188
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,496
You blew me off
'cause you like the ladies.

189
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,198
Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.

190
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,834
And right now,
it's the two ladies I like.

191
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,836
Robbie, if I were
gonna go lesbian,

192
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,456
she would be the last "les"
I'd "bian."

193
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,091
Listen, babe--

194
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,242
You really hurt her.

195
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:33,344
Stop.

196
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,347
She sleep-eats trans fats
thanks to you.

197
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,415
Here, stuff all of these
in your mouth.

198
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:43,086
Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.

199
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:45,105
Robbie, this isn't cool at all.

200
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,257
Mm-mm.

201
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,426
Showing up here
after what you did?

202
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,261
You go, girl.

203
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:54,565
I have something to say to you
and you had better listen.

204
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,602
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

205
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,939
What are you,
the relationship ghost?

206
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,407
Robbie, just go!

207
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,377
I can't say what I need to in
front of the relationship ghost.

208
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,212
I'll call you
to come get your stuff

209
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,330
and we can talk then.

210
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:10,614
Leave the key.

211
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:14,718
Straight up, Max,
you're breaking my heart.

212
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,838
You're the only woman
that I feel this way about.

213
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:24,094
Here.

214
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,347
Ladies, I don't know
what's going on here,

215
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:29,567
but it would've been
a lot sexier if I was in it.

216
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,905
Are you okay?

217
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,307
If you wanna talk, I'm here.

218
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:40,494
Can I get a hit off that?

219
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:49,653
You think these are good?

220
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,773
God, we're poor.

221
00:09:57,979 --> 00:09:59,046
Morning!

222
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,664
It's a beautiful day.

223
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,285
These shades belong down.

224
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,387
From now on, think of me
as a vampire

225
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,139
without all
the annoying marketing.

226
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,391
Bad news.

227
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,977
A pipe broke in the street
so the water's off.

228
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,729
Good news, when I went out
to get us two coffees,

229
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:19,016
I spoke to Juan and Javier,
two city workers.

230
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,119
And they assured me the water'll
be on no later than 3:00.

231
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,570
I also stopped
at the health food store

232
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:25,356
and got us
a fresh-squeezed juice to split.

233
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,124
It's ginger-apple-strawberry.

234
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,358
That was the name of the hooker

235
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,662
who had this apartment
before me.

236
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:34,832
What is this?

237
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,250
From me.

238
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,469
It says "Thanks for letting me
sleep in your bed last night."

239
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,006
I prefer my usual cash
on the bedside table.

240
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,042
When I went
to the cute coffee place,

241
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,377
I spoke to the counter girl,
Nabulangi--

242
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:50,147
If someone named Nabulangi
is making an appearance

243
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,132
in the first sentence,
I have to sit down.

244
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:55,218
And she said
her manager'll be in at 11:00.

245
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,721
So I thought I'd chanel it up,

246
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,889
walk on over there,

247
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,558
introduce myself
and your fabulous cupcakes.

248
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,778
That's exactly what
I was gonna do.

249
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,531
I'm just gonna go say good-bye
to Chestnut and get going.

250
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,416
You know, having
only one cute outfit

251
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:14,855
takes hours off
getting dressed.

252
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:18,625
Oh. That is a lot
of fresh Brooklyn.

253
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,077
Morning, Chestnut.

254
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,046
It's a beautiful--

255
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:26,249
No. Way.

256
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:40,981
Look, Chanel Number Two.

257
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:44,601
Tell me it's mud.

258
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,269
T-tell me it's mud.

259
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:48,789
It's mud?

260
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,207
What is that?

261
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,627
A carrot?

262
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,830
There's carrots in the mud?

263
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,970
There's no water.

264
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,339
Oh, get it off me, please.

265
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:06,340
Please do something.

266
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:08,475
Just get it off me,
get it off me.

267
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,510
Stop!

268
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:10,961
This is dry-clean only.

269
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,130
Max, please, please take me

270
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,183
somewhere they have
a hot shower, I beg of you.

271
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,636
Calm down, it's just mud.

272
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:19,153
Max, please--

273
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,739
Don't touch me!

274
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,037
Thank you so much
for taking me to shower

275
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,222
at your babysitting job.

276
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:31,073
Well, I didn't have
much of a choice.

277
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:33,509
You pulled the pillow knife
on me.

278
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:34,710
I'll just introduce myself
to your boss

279
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,695
and tell her what happened.

280
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:37,713
Look, I don't want Peach
to know you were here.

281
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,832
This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.

282
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,033
Got it.

283
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:42,552
You get in there, you
take a five-minute shower,

284
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,036
clean it up and go.

285
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:46,656
Fine, I'll hide in the hallway
till she's gone.

286
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:50,059
No need, just follow me in.
She never really looks at me.

287
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,394
Morning!

288
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,013
Hi, Max.

289
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,682
Go!

290
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:57,716
Hey, Peach.

291
00:12:57,718 --> 00:12:59,602
Uh, hair and makeup.

292
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,853
What's the big occasion?

293
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,105
Pilates.

294
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:05,224
Max, good news.

295
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:08,160
They found a way
to make diamonds more sparkly?

296
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:12,031
I got Brad and Angelina
a playdate

297
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,333
with another set of twins
in the building.

298
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,668
It starts in five minutes.

299
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,786
Cool, what are their names?

300
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:18,904
6B.

301
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:20,873
Bye-bye,
Brangelina.

302
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,341
Mommy loves you.

303
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,427
Guys?
Before you leave,

304
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,678
stop at this one.

305
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,079
Angelina could
use a little help.

306
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:30,099
Contour that neck,
she's a fatty.

307
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,884
Peach, come on,
that's baby fat.

308
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:34,387
Still, kids can be cruel.

309
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,189
Don't you listen
to your mommy, Angelina.

310
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,358
She never eats.

311
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,528
Oh, no, she doesn't.

312
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,915
Here it is.

313
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,400
Caroline with an "E."

314
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:49,601
I have your new
and correct nametag.

315
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:50,987
Oh, thank you, Han.

316
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:53,939
Oh.

317
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:56,158
I've seen something
I should not have.

318
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,778
I will just put correct nametag
here on counter.

319
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,250
So sorry, but many thank yous.

320
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:05,751
What are you doing?

321
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:07,970
I know you said
you don't want it up there.

322
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,955
But now that you see it...

323
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:11,641
How does it feel?

324
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,225
It feels like
you're not listening to me

325
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,727
at this job or at my other job.

326
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,646
I said a five-minute shower
and get out.

327
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,230
Did you take a nap at Peach's?

328
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,815
The thread count
was calling to me.

329
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,601
Peach found blonde hairs
in her bed

330
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:24,570
and thought her husband
was cheating on her.

331
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,356
Which he is,
but that's not the point.

332
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:30,026
You almost ruined
a perfectly happy fake marriage,

333
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:31,694
and there are
innocent children involved.

334
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,196
Well, I have some good news.

335
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:35,815
Look, it's Nabulangi.

336
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:37,833
I invited her in
to taste your amazing cupcakes.

337
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,453
And when she loves them,
we'll have an in at her bakery.

338
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,038
Come over and say hello.

339
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,323
No, I can't now. I wanna call
Robbie before we get too busy.

340
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:46,008
Tell him when to come over
and get his stuff.

341
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,209
Max, wait.

342
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:48,778
No, don't distract me.

343
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,429
I wanna sound cool and hot
and all like,

344
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,332
"You can't have me
anymore, sucka."

345
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,433
Max--

346
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,018
Robbie, it's me.

347
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,188
Classy burp
on your outgoing message.

348
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,506
Max, I--

349
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:01,557
No.

350
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,442
I need you to come
get your stuff tomorrow.

351
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,061
I don't know how
you've been surviving

352
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:08,230
without your chin-up bar
and Axe body spray.

353
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:09,198
Max, hang up.

354
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,650
I already called him.

355
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:13,703
You called Robbie?

356
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:14,787
You've done so much for me.

357
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,622
I wanted to do
something for you, too.

358
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,124
So I called Robbie
and I had him come over,

359
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,575
and I gave him his stuff.

360
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:21,827
Now you won't have to go through
with all that mess.

361
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:25,531
And I think you'd be pleased,
I really let him have it.

362
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,867
What is with you
and boundaries?

363
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:30,553
You're in my bed,
you're in my boss' bed,

364
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,004
and now you go and call Robbie?

365
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,806
You're like--
you're like your big-ass horse.

366
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,707
Charging in everywhere
you don't belong.

367
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,876
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

368
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,813
In spite of what you say
about the sounds I heard

369
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,264
coming from your bedroom
the other night,

370
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:43,899
I know you're upset.

371
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,553
I was masturbating.

372
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:51,690
I love my job.

373
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:55,044
I need to see you
outside. Now.

374
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:57,079
Don't get involved with her.

375
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,064
She takes money
from the homeless.

376
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:01,117
Not true, Bob's an investor.

377
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,334
Be right back.

378
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,538
Good cupcake, right?

379
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,042
Max, I don't know
how smart that was,

380
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:12,678
blowing by our only potential
business contact.

381
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,048
You stole my breakup scene.

382
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,933
The only remotely good thing
about breaking up with a guy

383
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,918
is telling him how much better
you are than him

384
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,604
when you give him back
his stuff.

385
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,222
I don't know if you noticed,

386
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:25,107
but my entertainment budget
is pretty low

387
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,859
and I was really
looking forward to that.

388
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,395
And then you went and stole it.

389
00:16:29,397 --> 00:16:30,946
But I guess
you couldn't help it,

390
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,749
'cause that's what you channings
do, you steal things.

391
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,452
Huh.

392
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,870
Interesting.

393
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,706
Okay, you wanted
a breakup scene?

394
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,907
You're in one.

395
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,242
I'm breaking up with you.

396
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:44,443
Oh, okay.

397
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,912
The cupcake business is over,
the dream is dead.

398
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:49,948
Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi
will be devastated.

399
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,635
I don't need you
or your cupcakes to survive.

400
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,836
I'll figure something else out.

401
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,639
Because, aside from your
constant Wharton putdowns,

402
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,057
I'm a business genius

403
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,925
and I will always land
on my feet.

404
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,227
Oh, really?

405
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,479
'Cause today you kind of
landed on your front.

406
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,181
We're done.

407
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,466
After work tonight,
I'll get my things and be gone.

408
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,819
Ooh, you gonna load up
your dream-filled wheelie bag

409
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,471
and ride away
on sir muds-a-lot?

410
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:15,357
Go ahead.
Be as negative as you want.

411
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,461
'Cause you're in charge
of your own future again.

412
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:20,344
Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.

413
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,309
Max...

414
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:36,078
Are you up?

415
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,813
No.

416
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:40,465
Max, are you mad?

417
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:41,466
Yes.

418
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:44,252
Are you up and mad?

419
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:46,722
No and yes.

420
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:49,174
Oh, your bed's so soft.

421
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:52,678
That's my boob.

422
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,148
I know I moved out,
but I came back.

423
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,633
I took the rest
of our dead dream money

424
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:01,653
and bought some cocktails
for myself and some people.

425
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:03,939
And myself.

426
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:05,574
Did you bring me back
any of those?

427
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,859
'Cause I can't
listen to this sober.

428
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:10,278
Max...

429
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,615
I have nothing.

430
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:16,451
I really need
the cupcake business.

431
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:19,654
I can be different.

432
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:20,906
No, you can't.

433
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:23,792
No, I can't.

434
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:27,379
But I can be better.

435
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,830
Please?

436
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:31,600
Please, let's do this.

437
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,802
I know you have
a fear of success.

438
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:37,505
You do, because no one
ever believed in your dreams.

439
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:41,176
But I believe in your dreams.

440
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:43,195
We have a dream.

441
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:45,680
God, you are so drunk.

442
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:49,618
So you probably
won't even remember this.

443
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,423
I'm sorry I said that stuff
about your father.

444
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,124
Did you hear me?

445
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:59,861
Max, are you up?

446
00:18:59,863 --> 00:19:05,801
Hey, do you have any more
of those poor people chips?

447
00:19:05,803 --> 00:19:10,038
What's up, hangover three?

448
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,306
Why are these up?

449
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:14,810
I thought we were vampires.

450
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:17,929
Here, I took the rest
of last night's cupcake money,

451
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:21,867
and brought you a coffee
and a fresh juice.

452
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,102
Which means that,
after two days in business,

453
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:27,522
we are $23 down
from where we were.

454
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:31,109
So we're still building
our cupcake business?

455
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:32,327
Sure.

456
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:34,329
All we need is how much?

457
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,865
$250,000.

458
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:39,835
Which is awesome.

459
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:43,121
Max, I'm sorry
I crossed all those boundaries.

460
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:44,339
It's cool.

461
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:46,291
Me and drunk Caroline
worked it all out.

462
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,293
In fact...

463
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:53,265
She signed this paper.

464
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:57,202
"I, drunk Caroline,
am a..."

465
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:59,020
What's that word?

466
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:02,023
Punk ass ho.

467
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:03,475
Thanks.

468
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:07,028
"I, drunk Caroline,
am a punk ass ho.

469
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,531
"I promise to keep
my big mouth shut,

470
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,451
"and replace all
of Max's poor people chips.

471
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:18,439
I will no longer meddle
in her relation-chips."

472
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:21,793
You laughed about that
until you threw up.

473
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,078
Oh, and if you're wondering,

474
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,331
no, the puke stains
will not void this contract.

475
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:32,453
God!

476
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:34,806
I forgot again
that we have a horse.

477
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,308
Max, get him out of here.

478
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,538
He doesn't know I'm a waitress.

479
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:42,308
Chestnut.

480
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:48,737
He is a champion.

481
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:50,523
He learned that a lot
faster than you did.
