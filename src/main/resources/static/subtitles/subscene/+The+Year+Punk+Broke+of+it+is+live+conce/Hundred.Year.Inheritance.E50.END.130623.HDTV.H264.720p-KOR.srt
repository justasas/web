00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:08,562
<i>Final Episode 50</i>

2
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:23,546
You said you would make sure I never get my hands in water loudly.

3
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:26,049
Making me even shave you.

4
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:27,563
Lee Se Yoon sshi

5
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:30,938
Isn't this joke a little too harsh?

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,246
Look at you just lying still and not even responding.

7
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:41,746
You can fool the doctors and everyone else, but

8
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:44,836
you can't fool my eyes.

9
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,841
Se Yoon, I know you are listening to everything I am saying.

10
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:54,334
<i>The patient's present condition is not just unconscious, but</i>

11
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:57,596
<i>it looks like he will progress into a vegetative state.</i>

12
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:59,686
<i>Vegetative state?</i>

13
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:03,012
If the patient remains unconscious for more than one month,

14
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,193
<i>it will be difficult to regain consciousness.</i>

15
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:07,303
<i>It is for certain.</i>

16
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:09,663
They said Se Yoon was in a vegetative state...

17
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:11,851
That can't be true.

18
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:17,071
When I say it

19
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:19,206
The eyes that always looked at me

20
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:22,609
were always sparkling.

21
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:29,806
So, hurry up and get up.

22
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,281
All the times you gave me a hard time,

23
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:37,658
you have to repay it.

24
00:01:39,356 --> 00:01:41,526
Let's see.

25
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:46,393
<i>Hundred Year Inheritance</i>

26
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:50,216
After shaving, you became more handsome.

27
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:32,000
Here drink this medicine, it is good for you.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,766
I made it, so

29
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,212
Get up, and

30
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:38,222
drink it all up.

31
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:40,082
I am fine.

32
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:42,293
What do you mean you are fine?

33
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:45,690
At times like this you are supposed to keep your eyes straight.

34
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,507
And take care of your body.

35
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:51,953
If Chae Won's mom gets sick to, then it will be a big problem.

36
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:53,813
So, get up.

37
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,355
Drink it all up.

38
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:57,312
Get up.

39
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:21,370
My own child is like that,

40
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,903
How can I drink this as a mother.

41
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,862
Why are you saying nonsense.

42
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:30,206
Because you haven't collapsed is why the kids are doing their best.

43
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:31,631
Don't say anything, and

44
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,550
drink it up.

45
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,131
Hurry.

46
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:44,476
Even if it doesn't go down, force it down.

47
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:47,002
Don't even leave a drop.

48
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:51,035
Good, Drink it all up.

49
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,651
Aigoo...

50
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,734
One's mind can be so tricky.

51
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:14,809
Not long ago, Sister,

52
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:19,744
you took Se Yoon away from me.

53
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:23,057
I wanted to kill you with my hate.

54
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:26,719
Since, Se Yoon turned out like that

55
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,871
I think I can connect with you.

56
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:35,790
Sister, you are also in torture as well, like me.

57
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:38,819
Sister, like me,

58
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,183
you must be hurting.

59
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:44,791
We both are

60
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,583
Se Yoon's mother.

61
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,857
You thinking like that,

62
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:54,050
I am thankful.

63
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,171
Sister, as you said,

64
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:00,717
If I raised Se Yoon,

65
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,552
I would have probably placed him far away,

66
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:07,606
or sent him to an orphanage.

67
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:11,210
Like Se Yoon right now.

68
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:16,000
I wouldn't have raised him that well.

69
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:19,596
You did well.

70
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:20,996
For you to

71
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:23,839
make me feel embarrassed.

72
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,387
It is not to make you feel embarrassed.

73
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,631
Unni,

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,224
come to Seoul with me.

75
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:39,793
Don't you miss Se Yoon?

76
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,012
It may seem belittle of me, but

77
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,357
I will remain here.

78
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,762
I want to repent.

79
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,930
I'm a person that doesn't have the courage to be next to Se Yoon.

80
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,485
From here,

81
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,869
I will volunteer and pray

82
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,804
for Se Yoon's full recovery.

83
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,602
For Se Yoon,

84
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:06,473
protect Se Yoon.

85
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:08,121
Promise me.

86
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,166
Sister.

87
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:25,167
After coming from the hospital, you became totally mute.

88
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:29,203
Are you in shock?

89
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:34,176
You don't need to think of it as serious.

90
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,236
Every time I went alone,

91
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:38,282
I felt lonely, and

92
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:42,446
All the wives with their husbands,

93
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:45,496
That is why I took you along.

94
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,403
If you don't like it, I will go alone from now on.

95
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,383
I knew you were a strong person.

96
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:56,677
It is really amazing.

97
00:06:57,713 --> 00:07:03,396
A child without its daddy is hard to do.

98
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:09,485
Why did I do that?

99
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:13,469
A child that looks like you,

100
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,671
I want one.

101
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:18,883
Ma Hong Joo.

102
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:20,745
A Mamma boy,

103
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:23,638
I don't know why I like you either.

104
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,382
That's just what I want to do.

105
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,508
That is all.

106
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:56,245
<i>Se Yoon sshi!</i>

107
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:57,921
<i>Please wake up.</i>

108
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:00,194
<i>Se Yoon sshi!</i>

109
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,331
What is wrong?

110
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:07,283
Why are you like this?

111
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:09,874
Please get yourself together.

112
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:13,293
He was just fine a bit ago, but then it's strange.

113
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:13,947
Se Yoon shhi!

114
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:16,228
Hey look, get yourself together.

115
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:19,435
Nurse! Nurse!

116
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:20,899
Se Yoon sshi!

117
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:24,002
I will call the doctor here in a moment. Please lay him down to the side.

118
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,045
We have to keep his airway clear.

119
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,928
To the side. To the side.

120
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:31,190
Wait just a little bit.

121
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,634
The doctor will be here, so it should be fine.

122
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,486
The patient is fine.

123
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,636
Why is he like this all of a sudden?

124
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:52,960
It is something that can happen after the surgery.

125
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,078
Everything is fine and stable.

126
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,601
After a little bit more treatment in the ICU,

127
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:01,189
we will move him back.

128
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,920
Yes, thank you.

129
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:15,400
It is nothing too severe. So, don't worry.

130
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:19,890
Thank you for today.

131
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:22,379
Are you okay?

132
00:09:23,616 --> 00:09:24,679
Yes, I am fine.

133
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,720
There is no problem.

134
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,867
You look very courageous.

135
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:35,832
For me at the beginning it was uneasy and hard, but

136
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:39,061
when I think about it,

137
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,157
the fact that I can even wait for him,

138
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,539
I think it's a great blessing.

139
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:49,210
We are breathing the same air.

140
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,153
That is true.

141
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:59,911
When I see you, I have the thought of having more courage.

142
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:02,778
Lately,

143
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:05,965
there's been another life that I'm waiting for.

144
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:12,098
Hong Joo is pregnant.

145
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:16,621
Congratulations.

146
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:22,140
Do I have any traits to be a father?<br> It made me want to run away.

147
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:25,072
When I see you,

148
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:28,510
I have the thought of having more courage.

149
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:46,636
Aiyoo... You're very tired, aren't you?

150
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,723
Congratulations, Mom.

151
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:55,815
What... What are you saying out of the blue?

152
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:59,722
What should I be congratulated for?

153
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,519
That... What is that...?

154
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:13,594
Isn't that an ultrasound picture of a baby?

155
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:18,153
Whose is it?

156
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,662
What do you mean "whose"?

157
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:21,925
It's mine.

158
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:25,111
What do you mean it's yours?

159
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,353
Congratulations, Mom.

160
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,857
It looks like you are going to have a grandchild in a few months.

161
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:33,443
You... Did you have a mishap?

162
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,776
Hong Joo...

163
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:40,036
Hong Joo... is pregnant.

164
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:44,602
What... What happened to her?

165
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,262
Hello?

166
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:12,497
Hey, do you think my son is a pushover?

167
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:14,910
It's been a long time, Mother.

168
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,459
Have you been well?

169
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,831
Ah... That's enough!

170
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,923
Didn't you take every penny that you could for your alimony?

171
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:26,104
Now, you're saying the baby you're carrying is Cheol Gyoo's?

172
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:28,372
You're framing him?

173
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,055
What do you mean by that?

174
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:31,900
To say it bluntly,

175
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,967
how can you guarantee the baby you're carrying is Cheol Gyoo's?

176
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,415
How would I know you didn't get pregnant by fooling around with others?!

177
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,507
Mother, you're still the same.

178
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:44,694
You... I want to...!

179
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,207
I'll make it short.

180
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:51,890
Just pay back my money.

181
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,828
Money? What do you mean?

182
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,702
You only lived with him for a few months, and

183
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:58,844
you took away all our assets. Does it make any sense?

184
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,398
Are you that worthy?

185
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:02,921
Mother.

186
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:06,822
Ah! Mother or Father...That's enough!

187
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:09,905
I'm in a very difficult situation right now.

188
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:12,917
I really need that money.

189
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,039
Let's meet first thing tomorrow.

190
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:17,522
We'll talk when we meet.

191
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,895
If I meet with you, I don't think it will help with my pregnancy.

192
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,855
So, I'm sorry, but I have to refuse.

193
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,023
Then...

194
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,294
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey... don't hang up!

195
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,841
Hey! I'm not done talking yet!

196
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:33,746
HEY!!

197
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,671
This wench...

198
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:41,280
Her rude behavior hasn't changed at all.

199
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:47,628
Do I look at it this way or that way?

200
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:19,662
<i>Damn it!</i>

201
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:23,510
What's the matter, Mom?

202
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:27,662
Hey, read this. Aigoo... Aigoo...

203
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:29,015
<br>

204
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:32,160
The merger of Tae San Group and Geum Ryung Foods...

205
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,299
The CEO is Ma...

206
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:36,679
Chairman Ma Hong Cheol's only daughter, Ms. Ma Hong Joo?

207
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,910
Hey, hey, when she met with you, did she say she got married or

208
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,796
anything like that?

209
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,996
No. She didn't say anything like that.

210
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,973
You have to get back with Hong Joo again!

211
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:56,741
What's this? You were so upset yesterday!

212
00:14:56,741 --> 00:15:01,132
She's pregnant. We can't just ignore that!

213
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,802
A man should be responsible.

214
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:10,148
It's your baby. We have to take care of it together.

216
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:35,302
You came?

217
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:39,383
Se Yoon...?

218
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:42,539
He was transferred to the ICU last night.

219
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:46,012
Why? Did he turn for worse?

220
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,981
He had convulsions all of a sudden.

221
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:51,916
You should have called if something like that happened.

222
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:54,370
Did his condition deteriorate?

223
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:57,899
They said it is common among patients who had neurosurgery.

224
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,021
In a little while, they said he will be moved to a regular floor, so

225
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:03,246
don't worry too much.

226
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:11,453
Aigoo... What would happen if the days just go by?

227
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:15,023
Your insides must be turning into ash.

228
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:25,248
You came?

229
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,852
Aigoo...Whoosha...

230
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:33,761
It looks like a lot more than before.

231
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:35,340
Right?

232
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm back.

233
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,342
Oh, Chae Won...

234
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:41,259
Are you just coming back from the hospital?

235
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:42,297
Yes.

236
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:45,931
Se Yoon... Se Yoon hasn't made any progress yet?

237
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,149
Yes.

238
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,785
Did they deliver the salt?

239
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:53,714
A little while ago, we received ten sacks of refined salt.

240
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,817
Are you changing out the salt?

241
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,871
Yes. Starting this month, I want to change to refined salt.

242
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:01,087
Okay.

243
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,938
Here...

244
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:14,746
By the way, you re-registered your marriage with Bo Reum's mom, didn't you?

245
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,116
No, we didn't do it yet.

246
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,100
If you just put it off like that, not only her first love...

247
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:23,921
What would happen if her second love shows up?

248
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,112
Hyungnim!

249
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,137
Did I say something incorrect?

250
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,290
So, let's just go to town hall and do it!

251
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,418
How many times do I have to tell you? I absolutely cannot re-register until I get a formal proposal from you!

252
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:43,297
I stopped by the bank on the way back from the hospital.

253
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,903
Bank?

254
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:49,777
Yes. We have to share the profit as I promised before.

255
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,560
<br>

256
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,559
You worked hard all this time.

257
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,442
-Thank you.<br>-Thank you.

258
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:04,543
Oh my goodness!

259
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,770
It's this much?!

260
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,840
Let me see. Let me see.

261
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:15,166
This is definitely a jackpot!

262
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,348
This wife...

263
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:22,460
We were supposed to split it precisely in halves.

264
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:28,170
<br>

265
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,669
If father were to see this, he would have been happy.

266
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:35,221
I feel that way.

267
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,352
How pretty!

268
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:56,431
By the way...

269
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,904
You can't say two different things with one mouth.

270
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:01,850
You said you would buy everything I want.

271
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,206
Honey, you definitely promised, ok?

272
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:05,030
I got it.

273
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,644
Gangnam's madam must have had a hard time working at the factory and living with in-laws.

274
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:14,153
I am so proud that if it were up to me, I would buy the whole store for you.

275
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:18,864
Only you know the hardship I had.

276
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,600
Pick anything you want.

277
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,653
Ok.

278
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:37,329
Let's get out of here.

279
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:40,948
Why? You don't like anything?

280
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:45,513
Come on.

281
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:49,359
Why did you come out empty-handed?

282
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,322
Oh, if I were to buy that purse...

283
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:56,080
How many boxes of our factory noodles do we have to sell?

284
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:01,601
I... really can't buy it because it makes me too nervous.

285
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:04,180
In the past, you were able to easily buy more expensive things than that.

286
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,362
That was then.

287
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:10,657
As the eldest daughter-in-law of a noodle factory, it doesn't suit me.

288
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,608
Let's go.

289
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:30,019
I will show you what's romantic!

290
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,212
You would never have imagined this.

291
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,793
Bo Reum's Mom. Bo Reum's Mom.

292
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,215
Mother.

293
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:01,346
Wait.

294
00:21:02,505 --> 00:21:04,104
What's that?

295
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,726
It's sparkling a lot.

296
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:25,011
Isn't it a diamond ring?

297
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,314
It's a diamond!

298
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:30,102
But why is this here?

299
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:34,168
Just what "surprise" are you going to show me?

300
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,618
Come here. Come here.

301
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,878
Wait a moment.

302
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,799
What is Son-in-Law Kang holding in his fist?

303
00:21:54,264 --> 00:21:56,074
There's nothing.

304
00:21:56,534 --> 00:21:59,009
The other hand.

305
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,843
In that short time you touched other people's things!

306
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:07,042
Give it to me.

307
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:10,509
Give it to me now!<br>I can't do that for free, brother-in-law.

308
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:14,552
Give it. Give it!

309
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:16,890
Give it.

310
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:21,655
Spit it out! Give it to me!

311
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:23,947
I didn't put it in my mouth.

312
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,874
What is it, Bo Reum's Dad?

313
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:32,419
The diamond ring that I was about hold while proposing to you was swallowed by him!

314
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:34,241
What?

315
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:39,357
You're really doing everything!

316
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,556
Stop playing around, spit it out.

317
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:44,963
Give it! Give it! Give it!

318
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:54,238
How can you swallow the ring?!!?

320
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:30,870
Chae Won.

321
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,650
-Did you run here? <br> -Yes.

322
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,073
I thought I may not make it to the visiting hour.

323
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:39,531
Is Se Yoon's guardian here?

324
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:41,480
-Yes <br>-Yes, I'm here.

325
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,563
The patient has woken up.

326
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:44,958
What?

327
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,295
What?

328
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:51,733
Se Yoon?

329
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:57,358
Se Yoon, are you regaining your senses?

330
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:03,625
Do you know who I am, Se Yoon?

331
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:10,573
Mom...

332
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,735
Chae Won...

333
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,429
Yes, yes. It's Mom.

334
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:23,863
It's mom, Se Yoon.

335
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,714
Thank you.

336
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,798
Thank you, Se Yoon.

337
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,492
For waking up like this, I thank you, my son.

338
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,728
You've worked hard throughout this time, Se Yoon.

339
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,449
Thank you.

340
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:04,556
Hello?

341
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:06,897
It's Chae Won, Mom.

342
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:09,215
Se Yoon...

343
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:12,449
Did something happen?

344
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:15,410
Se Yoon woke up.

345
00:25:18,787 --> 00:25:20,432
Really?

346
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:23,047
<i> Yes, he woke up awhile ago. </i>

347
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:29,104
Ah...really!

348
00:25:32,053 --> 00:25:34,010
Thank you, thank you.

349
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,781
You and your mom worked hard during this, Chae Won.

350
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:40,684
Thank you.

351
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:54,665
Thank you, Chae Won. Thank you very much.

352
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:05,453
What? Aigoo, is this a dream or is it real?

353
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:11,998
Is it true Se Yoon has regained consciousness? He can recognize people too?

354
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:14,830
Yes, yea. I'm on my way now.

355
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,733
Aigoo.

356
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,914
Our Se Yoon, woke up?

357
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:24,209
Yes, Mother-in-law. Just awhile ago,

358
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:27,943
Yes, he recognizes everyone and he's mentally unscathed.

359
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:31,730
That's great. It's great.

360
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,002
Now the big sister-in-law and Chae Won can rest easy.

361
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:39,316
I couldn't stand to watch the mother and daughter during this. I'm so glad.

362
00:26:39,316 --> 00:26:42,065
Your father is smiling from heaven right now.

363
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:45,907
Ah yes. Father-in-law helped us from up above.

364
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:48,593
Shouldn't we slaughter a pig and put on a feast for the village, mom?

365
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:52,331
Let's do it. What could possibly stop us?!

366
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:53,644
Let's do it!

367
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:56,657
Ah...so glad...

368
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,900
Mom!

369
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,760
I heard you became a total popper?

370
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,405
This woman is just...

371
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:09,128
Do we really have to live together with your mother?

372
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:11,507
Can't it just be you and me?

373
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,929
Korea's biggest Mamma boy.

374
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:18,810
I understand.

375
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:22,101
My mom changed so much.

376
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:26,599
She is not the old Bang Yong Ja chairman anymore. That person doesn't exist anymore.

377
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:31,122
She's swearing to become the best mother-in-law

378
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:33,683
of the Republic of Korea, and is burning with desire so

379
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,688
Just trust me for the last time.

380
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,344
She always has only the burning desire, pah!

381
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:45,441
Aigoo, Aigoo.

382
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:53,793
Sit down.

383
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:07,921
Aigoo, it's not like you're carrying just yourself. What deep bow should be necessary?

384
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:15,191
Aiyoo between us two, what formality should be observed, Ms. daughter-in-law?

385
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:17,897
Have you been well all this time?

386
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:19,904
Ah, by the way,

387
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:22,272
I totally forgot.

388
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:29,442
Aigoo, our daughter-in-law is looking so fine.

389
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:35,790
What fine? My shoulder's laden with burden due to the unexpected responsibility for the company.

390
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:44,003
By the way, how did you become the CEO?

391
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:51,394
Cheol Gyu gave me whole bunch of Geum Ryong shares when we divorced, so I became the majority share owner instantly.

392
00:28:56,926 --> 00:29:02,849
I've heard that you've treated badly on the account of you being the child born on the wrong side of the blanket,

393
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,515
but in reality

394
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:06,527
it doesn't seem that's true.

395
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:11,206
I have a good relationship with my oldest brother since we are half siblings.

396
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:13,642
Ah...I see.

397
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:35,381
Now that I get a chance to say it, after making you leave like that

398
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:38,485
my heart ached so much.

399
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:42,721
I bet you were upset, huh?

400
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,136
It's all passed now.

401
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:51,425
That's right. It's all in the past. Let's brush off all things in the past and

402
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:56,221
let's start anew with new attitude.

403
00:29:57,536 --> 00:30:02,929
From now on, I'm going to consider you my real daughter not a daughter-in-law.

404
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,401
If you do that I'll appreciate it.

405
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:12,787
By the way, you're not saying you'd like to live here together, right?

406
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:29,190
What to do?

407
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:34,866
Daughter-in-law must have heard the rumor and is aware,

408
00:30:35,744 --> 00:30:39,555
that we got caught by the evil conman so

409
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:42,568
we've become penniless.

410
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:48,095
Even though this house is small and uncomfortable,

411
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:51,557
let's think on our situation and

412
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:54,955
I hope you can understand us.

413
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:57,611
Then come to our house.

414
00:30:58,072 --> 00:30:59,316
Where is your house?

415
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,598
-Your last house. <br>-Our house?

416
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,250
Yes.

417
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:09,208
You...you mean you bought the house I used to live in?

418
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:17,191
If sister-in-law doesn't have any suitable job lined up, start working in our company starting next week.

419
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:20,801
I'll find a post for you in the business planning department.

420
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,051
Really?

421
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:26,221
You are my chief secretary?

422
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,118
Why aren't you answering? You don't like it?

423
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:38,144
Aigoo, what do you mean "not like it". He's like this because he does like it.

424
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:40,070
Aigoo, he likes it!

425
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:45,762
Aiyoo, you have become our family's savior!

426
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,334
A savior, I say.

427
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:51,462
You've revived the nearly collapsed husband's family...

428
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:56,388
You are the most devoted daughter-in-law among the daughters-in-law!

429
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,199
<i>Aigoo.</i>

430
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:03,471
<i>Aigoo.</i>

431
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:06,697
Aigoo, you good luck charm.

432
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:14,540
Chae Won worked hard throughout this time.

433
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,986
Every morning she brushed your teeth and shaved your face.

434
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:20,913
Even though she's my daughter,

435
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:23,944
I was really touched.

436
00:32:26,356 --> 00:32:29,981
I only did the things that are normal to be done.

437
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,074
That's why I'm saying this,

438
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:39,852
what do you think about quickly getting them married?

439
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:41,926
What do you think,

440
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,872
Chae Won's father?

441
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:45,948
Then,

442
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:49,078
do you give your blessing for the kids' marriage?

443
00:32:49,078 --> 00:32:51,963
I'm very sorry for everything.

444
00:32:52,662 --> 00:32:55,082
If I just hadn't objected,

445
00:32:55,082 --> 00:32:59,174
the kids wouldn't have had to go through this much trouble.

446
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:03,112
I'm sorry.

447
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:06,438
Sister-in-law,

448
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:08,269
I'm sorry.

449
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:12,793
Thanks, Honey.

450
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:17,861
Congratulations, Se Yoon.

451
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,779
Thank you.

453
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:29,647
It's time for Se Yoon to take his medicine.

454
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:57,041
Congratulations, How do you feel?

455
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:58,715
Good.

456
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:00,824
But, Doctor.

457
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,800
I have no feeling in my hands and it's hard picking up a cup.

458
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:08,652
I also have no feeling in my legs.

459
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:11,786
My condition won't continue like this, right?

460
00:34:12,794 --> 00:34:14,639
In your case,

461
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,878
though there isn't any specific nerve damage in your limbs

462
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:20,863
there is a slight possibility that you may have disability

463
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:23,843
due to undetected neurological nerve damage.

464
00:34:28,174 --> 00:34:30,302
What you just said,

465
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:35,418
does it mean that I might not be able to walk?

466
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,845
Right now there is nothing that I can confirm.

467
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,648
You must have patience

468
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:45,338
and do your best rehabilitating yourself.

469
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:47,859
There is no other way.

470
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,100
Surely,

471
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:09,596
it's not like Se Yoon won't be able to walk, right?

472
00:35:09,596 --> 00:35:10,859
It's not it.

473
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,554
That won't happen.

474
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:15,366
Don't worry about anything.

475
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:17,731
It should be like that.

476
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:20,619
There shouldn't be any problem.

477
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:24,181
Don't worry,

478
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:27,321
Calm your heart.

479
00:35:56,096 --> 00:36:00,493
I thought you would've thrown out that ring with anger.

480
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,141
I'm thankful that you still had it.

481
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:07,166
Truthfully that day,

482
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:12,064
I got a plane ticket from your mom and went to the airport.

483
00:36:12,948 --> 00:36:17,519
I was planning on giving up on everything and following you.

484
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:19,662
So don't be angry anymore, okay?

485
00:36:19,662 --> 00:36:23,337
How can I get mad at you?

486
00:36:23,337 --> 00:36:27,140
You're the person that has been with me all this time protecting me.

487
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,420
Se Yoon.

488
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,244
Thanks.

489
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,117
I owe you a life-long debt of gratitude.

490
00:36:35,898 --> 00:36:39,020
I'll give you a chance to repay me.

491
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,918
Since father-in-law gave us his permission to marry, so let's

492
00:36:41,918 --> 00:36:43,949
I'm sorry.

493
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,292
I can't even walk...

494
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,436
In this situation,

495
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:53,722
how am I supposed to propose to you?

496
00:36:53,722 --> 00:36:55,114
Se Yoon...

497
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:57,244
I'm sorry.

498
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:08,863
Be careful, careful.

499
00:37:08,863 --> 00:37:10,343
Carefully.

500
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:11,486
Over there.

501
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:13,847
-Yes. <br>-Yes.

502
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,929
You came, Mother.

503
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:25,752
Aigoo, I feel so relieved to be home

504
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:28,212
and away from living amongst those ignorant and inelegant women!

505
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:31,439
Aigoo, there's no other heaven!

506
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:33,591
Aigoo, where did Mrs. Park go?

507
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:35,656
I sent Mrs. Park away.

508
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,002
Oh.

509
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:41,524
So there is another worker besides Mrs. Park coming?

510
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:45,291
With Mom here, why would we need another worker?

511
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:46,772
What?

512
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:48,453
Wait.

513
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:52,852
You mean, then are you telling me to be responsible for the kitchen duty too?

514
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:56,592
So am I supposed to do it?

515
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:57,928
No,

516
00:37:57,928 --> 00:38:01,320
Well...

517
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:10,775
This is my room.

518
00:38:10,775 --> 00:38:12,457
Why is this your room?

519
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,102
This naturally is my...

520
00:38:14,102 --> 00:38:15,938
It's the biggest room in this house,

521
00:38:15,938 --> 00:38:19,745
and you want to use it all by yourself?

522
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:20,323
What?

523
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:22,699
If you want to be living off of a daughter-in-law,

524
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:25,664
be sensible, okay?

525
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,170
Living off of daughter-in-law?

526
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,040
Ai, hey,

527
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,751
Mother-in-law says because I'm pregnant I should use the master bedroom.

528
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,346
Seems like Mom changed alot.

529
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:45,793
Right? Didn't I tell you.

530
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:50,268
I told you that she became Korea's best mother-in-law.

531
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:52,470
Thanks, Mom.

532
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:09,835
I heard you turned down when Chae Won asked you to propose to her?

533
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:12,196
Just in case I can't walk due to a side effect of the accident,

534
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:15,387
or other disabilities

535
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:18,512
I couldn't decide to marry with ease.

536
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:19,459
Se Yoon...

537
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:23,565
I don't want to laden Chae Won with that sort of burden.

538
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:24,814
I can't do that.

539
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:27,427
Why are you only thinking about the bad?

540
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:31,372
Let's think more positively, shall we?

541
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,027
<i> I can't even walk... </i>

542
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:55,980
<i> I can't propose to you, Chae Won. </i>

543
00:40:00,977 --> 00:40:04,487
Aiyoo.

544
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:05,989
Ah...

545
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,503
what brings you here?

546
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:10,256
I'm a person in charge of the banquet

547
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:12,180
for the International Conference of Asian Arts &amp; Culture

548
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,302
named Bahg Gyu Sik.

549
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:18,996
Operation Center of Cheong Hwa Dae (Blue House = US's White House)?<br><i>"Chef Bagh Gyu Sik"</i>

550
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,512
I'm a chef.

551
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:23,126
What?

552
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:24,816
But why did you come-

553
00:40:24,816 --> 00:40:28,000
Your noodles have excellent reputation.

554
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,275
Thank you.

555
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:33,157
My job is to make dishes at the Blue House,

556
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:36,389
at this time, I've come to be responsible for the banquet

557
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:38,453
during the International Conference for the Asian Arts &amp; Culture,

558
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:42,362
I came in hope of offering your noodles during the banquet.

559
00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:44,183
Our noodles?

560
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:45,381
Yes.

561
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:48,320
I also wanted to watch how the unique tasting Son-Gook-Soo (hand made noodle)

562
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,364
was being made, exactly.

563
00:40:52,364 --> 00:40:53,911
Oh, yes.

564
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,771
Come this way.

565
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:57,109
I'll give you a guided tour.

566
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:59,922
Yes, thank you.

567
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:06,453
Bo Reum's Mom. Mom!

568
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:10,294
We will start with the easiest step first.

569
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:15,674
♫ <i> I can’t love you. </i> ♫

570
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:18,988
♫ <i> I can’t approach you. </i> ♫

571
00:41:18,988 --> 00:41:24,156
♫ <i> Why do you get farther away when I love you? </i> ♫

572
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,439
Even among the patients who are diagnosed as paraplegic

573
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:30,093
some are known to walk again if they focus on rehabilitation process.

574
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:32,914
So, don't give up.

575
00:41:32,914 --> 00:41:38,725
♫ <i> Although I’m standing in that spot, crying as I wait. </i> ♫

576
00:41:38,725 --> 00:41:45,671
♫ <i> Living doesn’t feel like living.</i> ♫

577
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:52,567
♫ <i> Why did I come to love you? </i> ♫

578
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:56,372
♫ <i> My longing keeps growing bigger, </i>

579
00:41:56,372 --> 00:42:02,837
♫ <i> I can’t bear to forget you. </i> ♫

580
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:09,200
♫ <i> So I still only love you. </i> ♫

581
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:20,082
Se Yoon.

582
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,200
Are you not here?

583
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:36,435
Did Lee Se Yoon go somewhere?

584
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,630
He told the doctor that he would go on a trip for a few days.

585
00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:42,145
A trip?

586
00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:43,556
Where did he go?

587
00:42:43,556 --> 00:42:47,321
I'm not sure.

588
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,502
<i>"The telephone of the person you're trying to reach is turned off..."</i>

589
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:06,121
Just where did he go when he's not completely healed?

590
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,415
Fox, a fox. There isn't more cunning fox amongst all the foxes, doctor.

591
00:43:14,448 --> 00:43:20,322
Aigoo, when my son's around, she pretends to be so nice

592
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:22,072
but as soon as he's gone

593
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:25,137
right away her true nature comes out!

594
00:43:25,153 --> 00:43:30,000
Aigoo, she is beyond wicked!

595
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,116
Since the subject came up,

596
00:43:33,116 --> 00:43:36,337
she checks the housekeeping ledger and checks even the receipt...

597
00:43:36,337 --> 00:43:41,264
Man, oh man. She's so cheap and nasty, I can't stand it!

598
00:43:41,823 --> 00:43:47,719
I mean, doesn't she know I've earned as much as money as she does back in my hay day?

599
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:51,444
She is such a know-it-all and a showy of her wealth that

600
00:43:51,444 --> 00:43:53,664
I just can't stand it.

601
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,509
In a word, a turn-off!

602
00:43:56,523 --> 00:43:58,514
I'm bet you were upset.

603
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:01,834
For sure I'm upset.

604
00:44:01,854 --> 00:44:06,087
I feel like inside here is all charred completely black and

605
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:10,538
is only left with ashes.

606
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:12,226
I see.

607
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:19,999
I mean, what kind of a person treats her mother-in-law

608
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,227
less than the dog she has?

609
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:25,144
I mean...

610
00:44:25,175 --> 00:44:26,443
A dog, you say?

611
00:44:26,443 --> 00:44:27,908
Yes.

612
00:44:27,908 --> 00:44:30,131
To her dog,

613
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:35,144
she does all kinds of pampering for the dog giving snacks on time

614
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:39,327
but she never ask her mother-in-law whether she ate or has skipped a meal

615
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,164
not even in passing.

616
00:44:43,198 --> 00:44:47,139
In a word, she's inhuman.

617
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:51,393
So the major source of your frustration is your daughter-in-law.

618
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,452
Yes.

619
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:57,634
I would like to live in a world without a daughter-in-law.

620
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:01,653
I feel each day

621
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,024
is beyond suffering.

622
00:45:04,024 --> 00:45:06,806
We are in a war without a gun sound.

623
00:45:06,806 --> 00:45:11,132
I can't stand it because it's so repulsive!

624
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:24,109
I feel so much better now that I've poured my heart out.

625
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:27,393
Who is that over there?

626
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:29,374
Isn't that Chae Won?

627
00:45:29,398 --> 00:45:32,706
Hey, our baby.

628
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:44,832
It's been awhile.

629
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:46,405
How did you come-

630
00:45:46,405 --> 00:45:50,256
I came to get treatment in the mental health department.

631
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:51,865
Mental health department?

632
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:56,699
Aihoo, I'm mentally struggling a little these days.

633
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:58,681
Is something wrong?

634
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:02,185
No, it's just...

635
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,229
<i>Just laugh, laugh.</i>

636
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:12,829
<i>Just laugh.</i>

637
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:16,118
<i>You have all the fun you can have with another man, do all things you should or shouldn't do with him</i>

638
00:46:16,118 --> 00:46:19,109
<i>and deny all by saying "I can't remember any of it" </i>

639
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,047
<i>and return to the way things were before?</i>

640
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:25,110
<i>I will ask for forgiveness after confessing the truth.</i>

641
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,677
<i>You are going to live as if nothing happened, is that right? </i>

642
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,472
<i>Wow! You really live the world as you wish.</i>

643
00:46:32,472 --> 00:46:37,781
<i>I'll return Cheol Gyoo to you, Mother.</i>

644
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:45,066
<i>I will unconditionally get a divorce.</i>

645
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,372
<i>So, please leave my father alone.</i>

646
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:57,217
I understand your feelings now.

647
00:46:57,261 --> 00:46:59,157
What?

648
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:02,152
These days,

649
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:05,664
I suffer unfair treatment from my daughter-in-law,

650
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,813
I'm saying that I now understand what you were feeling.

651
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:15,041
It is said there's no person above another nor below

652
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:20,233
and there should be no mother-in-law above daughter-in-law and vice-versa,

653
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,648
as I keep on suffering,

654
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:28,466
I feel as though I have come to understand you.

655
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:32,140
Why are you saying this so suddenly?

656
00:47:32,404 --> 00:47:36,221
I'm being punished right now.

657
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:39,497
All the things I did to you are being returned to me exactly.

658
00:47:39,514 --> 00:47:44,052
I'm being punished by the daughter-in-law right now.

659
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:48,690
I didn't know it back then,

660
00:47:48,723 --> 00:47:53,763
but I have come to understand your feelings a bit.

661
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:58,368
Throughout that time,

662
00:47:58,368 --> 00:48:01,131
I was too harsh.

663
00:48:02,772 --> 00:48:05,122
Forgive me.

664
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:11,946
If I don't apologize to you now,

665
00:48:11,946 --> 00:48:13,757
for the rest of my life,

666
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,555
as I live or die, go left or right,

667
00:48:16,555 --> 00:48:18,816
I'll remain exactly as I am now

668
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:22,305
being treated less than a dog.

669
00:48:22,335 --> 00:48:26,229
So, I'm sorry.

670
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:44,745
What's with your face?

671
00:48:44,763 --> 00:48:47,961
Since you're caring for the sick, you have to eat better, don't you know?

672
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:52,224
Buy something to eat and put some products on your face.

673
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:54,175
It's fine.

674
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:56,556
It's my sincere effort so just take it.

675
00:48:56,556 --> 00:48:59,387
This is all I have right now.

676
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:07,405
<i> Mom, where are you right now? </i>

677
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:11,626
Uh, I came out to run an errand.

678
00:49:11,626 --> 00:49:16,339
I informed you that today was Coco's vaccination day. Did you go to the vet?

679
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:21,660
Hey! Hey, your mother-in-law is about to die of anger!

680
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,181
Do you think you should care about a mere dog, right now?!

681
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:26,840
<i> Mom! </i>

682
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:31,486
I understand. I'm going.

683
00:49:33,312 --> 00:49:35,327
I'll see you.

684
00:49:46,912 --> 00:49:49,108
I'm back.

685
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,624
Is there no one home?

686
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,264
Where did they all go?

687
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:59,294
Mom? Aunt?

688
00:50:05,694 --> 00:50:08,225
Grandmother isn't here either.

689
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:12,527
Se Yoon was like that too.

690
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:15,511
Where did everyone go without a word?

691
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,320
Hello?

692
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,120
Chae Won, There's a problem.

693
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,489
Why? What happened?

694
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:29,456
Right now, all the noodles we supplied to Arts & Culture conference are spoiled.

695
00:50:29,456 --> 00:50:31,762
We have a mess on our hands with food-poisoning.

696
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:33,606
The noodle was spoiled?

697
00:50:33,606 --> 00:50:35,315
There's no way that could happen.

698
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:37,862
I'll go over there right now.

700
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:57,146
Today you can't cry like the last time, okay?

701
00:50:57,146 --> 00:50:59,280
Ok, am I an idiot?

702
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,401
Don't make a mistake,

703
00:51:01,422 --> 00:51:03,085
just do as you always have.

704
00:51:03,085 --> 00:51:05,619
If you do that then first place will be yours.

705
00:51:06,255 --> 00:51:09,313
Maybe it's because this is live broadcasting? I'm so nervous.

706
00:51:09,343 --> 00:51:11,726
Even my heart feels like it's clanking.

707
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:14,606
Our "Blessing" is going to criticize

708
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:17,015
that daddy is a coward.

709
00:51:17,015 --> 00:51:18,534
So, fighting!

710
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,377
"Blessing"!

711
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:25,020
Daddy will have glorious victory on the stage! Fighting!

712
00:51:25,098 --> 00:51:26,499
-Fighting! <br> -Fighting!

713
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:27,267
Awesome!

714
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:31,844
Next contestant is this contest's Teuroteu genre's favored candidate

715
00:51:31,844 --> 00:51:34,640
Ddool Uh's Gang Jin!

716
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:05,587
We'll announce.

717
00:53:05,587 --> 00:53:07,967

Kang Jin's, Dooruh.

00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,150
Yes!

721
00:53:32,274 --> 00:53:33,938
Honey!?

722
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,579
Uh?<br>Hur!

723
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,199
Why is he fainting after singing so well?

724
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:44,802
I say he does all kinds of craziness.

725
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:47,724
Call them and check whether they should go to the hospital.

726
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,041
There's no reason to. He just fainted from loss of nerves.

727
00:53:51,041 --> 00:53:54,107
Never mind, mom. Don't worry about a thing.

728
00:53:54,107 --> 00:53:57,452
I think uncle-in-law will be up on YouTube again!

729
00:53:57,452 --> 00:53:58,820
It's admirable though.

730
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:00,099
1st place is 1st place, no?

731
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:03,823
That's what I'm saying. When you go out in public, that song is played constantly!

732
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,480
Gang hubby is definitely an outstanding person.

733
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,635
Hey, can anyone take the 1st place?

734
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:14,072
Chae Won came.

735
00:54:14,072 --> 00:54:14,939
Oh!

736
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,703
Let's go.

737
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:27,413
Excuse me!

738
00:54:27,966 --> 00:54:30,203
How do I get to the International Conference center?

739
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:32,082
By any chance, are you Min Chae Won?

740
00:54:32,198 --> 00:54:33,363
Yes.

741
00:54:33,465 --> 00:54:34,964
Please follow me.

742
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:38,627
There's no way the noodles are spoiled.

743
00:54:38,627 --> 00:54:41,205
Please let me meet with the person in charge of food preparation.

744
00:54:41,535 --> 00:54:43,408
First, follow me.

746
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,247
Mom!

747
00:54:55,488 --> 00:54:56,458
Mother-in-Law!

748
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:00,659
What's going on?

749
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,450
First of all,

750
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:06,242
let's change your cloth into this.

751
00:55:09,094 --> 00:55:10,936
Just what is going on?

752
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:12,332
Throughout this time,

753
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:16,333
Because of us things have been hard. It's a present.

754
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:17,851
What?

755
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:21,116
We've decided to have a small wedding ceremony just with the family.

756
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:24,742
You'll marry Se Yoon, right?

757
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:27,413
I want to do that but,

758
00:55:27,884 --> 00:55:29,575
Se Yoon hasn't-

759
00:55:29,974 --> 00:55:32,034
Don't worry.

760
00:55:32,235 --> 00:55:36,025
Of course the bridegroom has agreed so we could hold the ceremony, Ms. Bride.

761
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:37,517
Se Yoon

762
00:55:38,196 --> 00:55:39,698
agreed?

763
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:44,617
Where in the world is there a man that wouldn't like a beautiful bride like you?

764
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:56,120
<i>A big thanks to all our faithful viewers.</i>

765
00:55:58,801 --> 00:56:00,491
Chae Won!

766
00:56:02,685 --> 00:56:03,856
Aiyoo!

767
00:56:03,856 --> 00:56:06,350
My daughter is really very beautiful.

768
00:56:06,468 --> 00:56:08,999
The celestial fairy has descended from the heaven!

769
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:12,290
Dad.

770
00:56:13,825 --> 00:56:14,741
Throughout this time,

771
00:56:15,656 --> 00:56:18,166
I'm sorry for upsetting you all this time.

772
00:56:18,297 --> 00:56:21,408
If we talk about feeling guilty, I should be more sorry.

773
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,033
Don't cry.

774
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:26,792
Your make-up will get messed up.

775
00:56:30,391 --> 00:56:31,800
Don't cry, don't cry.

776
00:56:37,057 --> 00:56:39,158
Groom, enter.

785
00:57:18,891 --> 00:57:22,851
After their wedding ceremony ends, should we take a photo since we're all dressed up like this?

786
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:25,866
I've never seen a human being that asks to recycle a wedding ceremony.

787
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:29,308
Still, the diamond ring isn't recycled.

788
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:31,567
I'm wearing considering that it's your sincere effort.

789
00:57:31,807 --> 00:57:34,787
I feel all grossed out when I think how the ring was in Roof-top's belly!

790
00:57:35,307 --> 00:57:38,188
No matter how hard try I just can't like that guy.

What happened?

799
00:59:09,736 --> 00:59:11,616
I want to surprise you.

800
00:59:11,637 --> 00:59:13,990
so I put unbelievable amount of effort in physical therapy!

801
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,160
This is all thanks to you, Chae Won.

802
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,162
For holding my hand,

803
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:22,366

804
00:59:23,213 --> 00:59:25,163

805
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:28,675
Thank you.

00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:41,158
What did I say.

807
00:59:41,637 --> 00:59:45,250
Chae Won's Grandfather is helping from heaven.

808
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:48,908
Thanks, Choon Hee.

809
00:59:49,108 --> 00:59:50,919
For giving birth to such an amazing son.

810
00:59:51,066 --> 00:59:54,983
Thanks Sister, for raising him to be such an amazing person.

Thanks for the delicious noodles.

01:00:34,075 --> 01:00:36,368
Yes, thank you.

814
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:37,575
Glad you came.

815
01:00:53,638 --> 01:00:58,569
Even though the world has become a place that believing its prosperity gave right to look down upon noodles

816
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,429
the noodles during hardship

817
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:05,510
is a thankful food that filled the hungry bellies

818
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:09,751
and economic and readily available food eaten during the wedding or ancestral rites ceremony

819
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:14,282
and is a warm food that melted the coldness in hearts.

820

I hope that you who have come to continue the 4th generation family business

821
