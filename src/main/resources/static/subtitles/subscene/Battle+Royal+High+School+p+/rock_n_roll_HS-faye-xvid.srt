350
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,382
         Me.                    
                I know.         

351
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:56,667
            I know, I know.     
         Me.                    

352
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,186
Go and monitor                  
the halls.                      

353
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:09,196
     Since assuming office      
     this morning,              

354
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:11,532
     I've noticed a number      
     of peculiar incidents      

355
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,733
      Among the members         
      of the student body,      

356
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:17,371
    All having to do            
    with rock-'n'-roll music.   

357
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:20,240
    Miss Togar, I have          
    no particular love          
    for rock-'n'-roll,          

358
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,910
But it doesn't seem to me       
that listening to it            

359
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,878
         Actually hurts         
         the students.          

360
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:28,248
             <i>(laughs)</i> but that's
             where you're wrong,
             Mr. Mcgree.        

361
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:30,350
    Recently,                   
    I have been doing a study   

362
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,520
         Of mice subjected      
         to rock-'n'-roll music.

363
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,091
     Here we have a picture     
     of this mouse,             

364
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:41,111
  A typical member              
  of the genus <i>rattus rodenti,</i>  

365
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:44,264
     As he appeared             
     before the start           
     of my investigation -      

366
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,767
      Clean, good-natured,      

367
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:52,306
  Content to scamper playfully  
  about his cage.               

368
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:57,978
      This is a picture         
      of the same mouse...      

369
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:01,615
One week after the introduction 
of rock-'n'-roll music.         

370
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:03,066
I never dreamed.                

371
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:05,119
                 Oh, the results
                 were dramatic. 

372
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,287
            He lost all interest

373
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,490
                  In keeping    
                  his cage tidy.

374
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:10,957
        How scientific.         

375
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,243
             He played          
             his electric guitar
             far into the night,

376
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,478
             Keeping the other  
             test animals awake.

377
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:16,780
He did?                         

378
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:18,782
              And he met        
              this female mouse,

379
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:21,284
      And they have been sharing
      a cage together           

380
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:22,953
                 Out of wedlock.

381
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:25,172
That's fascinating,             
Miss Togar.                     

382
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:29,176
                     Yes, it is.

383
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:31,611
         Is she crazy?          

384
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:33,230
She's a principal.              

385
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,232
            Monitor the hall,   
            monitor the hall.   

386
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,168
         I am sick              
         of monitoring the hall.

387
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:40,204
        Yep.                    

388
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:43,574
                Let's go monitor
                the freshman.   
        Good idea.              

389
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,708
                        Get him.

390
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,543
      All right,                
      up against the wall.      

391
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,212
          Spread 'em.           

392
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,981
All right, what the hell        
do you think you're doing       
out here?                       

393
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:52,816
I was just getting              
my books.                       

394
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,785
     Listen,                    
     you have a hall pass?      
Well, no.                       

395
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:58,788
      <i>(both)</i> no hall pass?      
            Hit him, hit him.   

396
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,326
Guys, I'm allergic to violence. 
I break out in blood.           
                 Hit him anyway.

397
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,761
     Calm down.                 
     Let me see some id.        
     I haven't got all day.     

398
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:06,763
I need it                       
for the sock hop tonight.       

399
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:09,733
        The sock hop.           
        Who'd dance with you?   

400
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:13,337
    All you have is a buck?     
                 I'll have that.

401
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,273
         Is this you?           
Well, I take                    
a bad picture.                  

402
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,642
    Tell me about it.           
             <i>(both)</i> ugh.        

403
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:22,246

a demerit.                      
What's a demerit?               

404
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,715
     If you get enough of 'em,  
     you wind up in Miss Togar's
     office.

407
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,257
            Hit him now.        
            Hit him. Hit him.   

408
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,526
      I have a great idea.      
      Let's go monitor          
      the girls' gym.           

409
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,027
                      All right.
              Ok?

                          A fox?

538
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:36,252
Tom Roberts is so boring,       
his brother is an only child.   

539
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:38,755
            He's not half as hot
            as Joey Ramone.     

540
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:40,089
Who's Joey Ramone?

     He just happens            
     to be the lead singer      
     of the Ramones.            

544
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:50,400
          I wish we could       
          see them this Thursday
          at their concert.     

545
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:51,902
    So what's stopping you?     

546
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,738
We can't cut classes            
to stand in line                
for tickets.

                That's right.   
         Oh, please.            

548
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,242

      no one will care          

549
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:02,345
If you've ever been             
to high school, much less       
skipped a few classes.          

550
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:05,181
You all act                     
as if everything's              
so important around here.       

551
00:28:05,182 --> 00:28:07,517
      Just because Togar        
      is stuck in the '50s      

552
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:10,086
    Doesn't mean                
    there isn't life            
    after high school.          

553
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:12,556
     I've got my own future     
     to think about.            

554
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,591
    I know I can write          
    for the Ramones.            

555
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,393
    All I've gotta do           
    is get my songs to them.    

556
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:19,462
     They won't be in town      
     for another year,          

557
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:21,464
         So I've got to         
         see them now.          

558
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:23,466
Hey, we wanna go                
as much as you,                 

559
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,468
But we can't all                
cut classes.                    

560
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,470

instituted immediately.

  if they wore neckties.
