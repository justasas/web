350
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:39,182
         Me.                    
                I know.         

351
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:40,467
            I know, I know.     
         Me.                    

352
00:18:40,468 --> 00:18:42,986
Go and monitor                  
the halls.                      

353
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:52,996
     Since assuming office      
     this morning,              

354
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:55,332
     I've noticed a number      
     of peculiar incidents      

355
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,533
      Among the members         
      of the student body,      

356
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:01,171
    All having to do            
    with rock-'n'-roll music.   

357
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:04,040
    Miss Togar, I have          
    no particular love          
    for rock-'n'-roll,          

358
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,710
But it doesn't seem to me       
that listening to it            

359
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:08,678
         Actually hurts         
         the students.          

360
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,048
             <i>(laughs)</i> but that's
             where you're wrong,
             Mr. Mcgree.        

361
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,150
    Recently,                   
    I have been doing a study   

362
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:17,320
         Of mice subjected      
         to rock-'n'-roll music.

363
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,891
     Here we have a picture     
     of this mouse,             

364
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:24,911
  A typical member              
  of the genus <i>rattus rodenti,</i>  

365
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:28,064
     As he appeared             
     before the start           
     of my investigation -      

366
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,567
      Clean, good-natured,      

367
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:36,106
  Content to scamper playfully  
  about his cage.               

368
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:41,778
      This is a picture         
      of the same mouse...      

369
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,415
One week after the introduction 
of rock-'n'-roll music.         

370
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,866
I never dreamed.                

371
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,919
                 Oh, the results
                 were dramatic. 

372
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,087
            He lost all interest

373
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,290
                  In keeping    
                  his cage tidy.

374
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,757
        How scientific.         

375
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:57,043
             He played          
             his electric guitar
             far into the night,

376
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,278
             Keeping the other  
             test animals awake.

377
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,580
He did?                         

378
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:02,582
              And he met        
              this female mouse,

379
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,084
      And they have been sharing
      a cage together           

380
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:06,753
                 Out of wedlock.

381
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,972
That's fascinating,             
Miss Togar.                     

382
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:12,976
                     Yes, it is.

383
00:20:12,977 --> 00:20:15,411
         Is she crazy?          

384
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:17,030
She's a principal.              

385
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:19,032
            Monitor the hall,   
            monitor the hall.   

386
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,968
         I am sick              
         of monitoring the hall.

387
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:24,004
        Yep.                    

388
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,374
                Let's go monitor
                the freshman.   
        Good idea.              

389
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,508
                        Get him.

390
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,343
      All right,                
      up against the wall.      

391
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:32,012
          Spread 'em.           

392
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:34,781
All right, what the hell        
do you think you're doing       
out here?                       

393
00:20:34,782 --> 00:20:36,616
I was just getting              
my books.                       

394
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:39,585
     Listen,                    
     you have a hall pass?      
Well, no.                       

395
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:42,588
      <i>(both)</i> no hall pass?      
            Hit him, hit him.   

396
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:46,126
Guys, I'm allergic to violence. 
I break out in blood.           
                 Hit him anyway.

397
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,561
     Calm down.                 
     Let me see some id.        
     I haven't got all day.     

398
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,563
I need it                       
for the sock hop tonight.       

399
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:53,533
        The sock hop.           
        Who'd dance with you?   

400
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:57,137
    All you have is a buck?     
                 I'll have that.

401
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:00,073
         Is this you?           
Well, I take                    
a bad picture.                  

402
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:02,442
    Tell me about it.           
             <i>(both)</i> ugh.        

403
00:21:02,443 --> 00:21:06,046

a demerit.                      
What's a demerit?               

404
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:09,515
     If you get enough of 'em,  
     you wind up in Miss Togar's
     office.

407
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,057
            Hit him now.        
            Hit him. Hit him.   

408
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:19,326
      I have a great idea.      
      Let's go monitor          
      the girls' gym.           

409
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:20,827
                      All right.
              Ok?

00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:20,052
Tom Roberts is so boring,       
his brother is an only child.   

539
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:22,555
            He's not half as hot
            as Joey Ramone.

Who's Joey Ramone?

     He just happens            
     to be the lead singer      
     of the Ramones.            

544
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:34,200
          I wish we could       
          see them this Thursday
          at their concert.     

545
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,702
    So what's stopping you?     

546
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:38,538
We can't cut classes            
to stand in line

      no one will care

00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:46,145
If you've ever been             
to high school, much less       
skipped a few classes.          

550
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:48,981
You all act

so important around here.       

551
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,317
      Just because Togar        
      is stuck in the '50s      

552
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:53,886
    Doesn't mean                
    there isn't life            
    after high school.          

553
00:27:53,887 --> 00:27:56,356
     I've got my own future     
     to think about.            

554
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:58,391
    I know I can write          
    for the Ramones.            

555
00:27:58,392 --> 00:28:01,193
    All I've gotta do           
    is get my songs to them.    

556
00:28:01,194 --> 00:28:03,262
     They won't be in town      
     for another year,          

557
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:05,264
         So I've got to         
         see them now.          

558
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:07,266
Hey, we wanna go                
as much as you,                 

559
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:09,268
But we can't all                
cut classes.

instituted immediately.

  if they wore neckties.
