1
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,745
Mr. Andrews, Mr. Kudo, Mr. Fairchild.

2
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:42,414
Morning.

3
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:45,000
Mr. Jensen,
didn't see you at the History Club meeting.

4
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:46,836
That was the idea.

5
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:50,005
Mr. Edwards, how did the castration go
on that polo pony?

6
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:51,423
You're next, pal.

7
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:53,592
Nice tie, teach. Clip-on?

8
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:56,345
- Daddy's boy.
-Bite me!

9
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,516
Wellington Academy. Are you white?

10
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:02,810
Hold, please. I'll put you right through.

11
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:07,857
Wellington Academy. Are you white?

12
00:01:08,524 --> 00:01:09,900
Hold, please. I'll put you through.

13
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:17,074
Mr. Clark, your father's waiting for you.

14
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:24,206
How are you doing, Mr. Clark?
Looking good.

15
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,293
- Thank you, Mr. Kuntzler, I'm fine.
-Good.

16
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:35,092
There he is, the man of the hour.

17
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:43,392
Son, don't just stand there. Come join us.

18
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:46,270
For a moment,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

19
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:47,938
Father, I really need to talk to you.

20
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:51,650
Plenty of time for that, son.
Sit down. I have something to tell you.

21
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:54,445
Sit down, Richard, and smoke.

22
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:58,449
- But, Father--
-Now, everyone smokes a pipe here.

23
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:00,326
I do it. Your grandfather did it.

24
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,161
Even the Indians smoked on this land...

25
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:05,456
before they traded it away
for some chickens and a pound ofjewellery.

26
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,875
- But, Father, I hate--
-Suck.

27
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,214
Son, it gives me great pleasure
to announce that we're promoting you...

28
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:16,300
to Assistant Vice Chairman
of the History Department.

29
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:20,721
Father, that's why we have to talk.

30
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,640
Yes, there's lots to talk about.

31
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:25,684
You'll need a telephone,
and we'll move you from the basement--

32
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:29,396
Father, for once in your life,
will you just listen to me?

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,856
Oh, my-

34
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,612
Look, I've taken a job...

35
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,156
at Barry High School.

36
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:44,995
For the moment, I will assume that you've
found a sense of humour and are joking.

37
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:46,705
I'm not joking.

38
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:49,667
Richard, if you do this, you will fail.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,710
You will fail.

40
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:56,382
And mark my words, you'll come crawling
back here with your tail between your legs.

41
00:02:56,465 --> 00:02:59,885
You're wrong, Father.
I'm going to succeed at Barry High School.

42
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,557
And I have no intention of ever crawling
back here with anything between my legs.

43
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:15,961
Barry High.

44
00:04:35,898 --> 00:04:38,943
Hey, could you point me
to the faculty parking lot?

45
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:41,904
Thanks a lot.

46
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:55,978
Where?

47
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,961
Beautiful morning.

48
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,894
- Come on, give me a break.
-All right.

49
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:38,354
Man.

50
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:41,232
Hold it. What is this?

51
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,365
- No, wait a minute.
-What the heck is this? Get on in there.

52
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,200
Come here.

53
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,912
- You had them last week.
-I know what you mean.

54
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:57,081
All right, give me $3.

55
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,044
My brother, 24 carats, $24.

56
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:04,213
No, thank you. I already have a--

57
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:14,849
<i>Falique Abdul, please come to the office.
One of your fathers is here.</i>

58
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,560
You watch it, okay. Okay?

59
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:24,358
- Who's that?
-How the hell should I know?

60
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:39,290
Well, what have we got here?
Griff, welcome back, bro.

61
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:41,542
So you finally got what you wanted?

62
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,129
It's a nice little business.
Keeps us in pocket change.

63
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:47,965
I knew it was you that set me up, bro.

64
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:51,677
If it bothers you that much,
go ahead, make your move.

65
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:54,305
Or did that year in juvie soften your cheese?

66
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:57,725
This is my turf now.
You show me respect. Me.

67
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:01,312
Paco de la Vega-El Camino-Cordova-Jose
Cuervo- Sanchez-Rodriguez...

68
00:08:03,147 --> 00:08:04,398
Junior.

69
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:07,359
Are we not forgetting a name?

70
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:09,862
- What's that?
-Skid mark.

71
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:14,658
All right, you toughs. Break it up.

72
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,077
Now, cut it out.

73
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,247
You boys ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

74
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,625
School is no place for fighting.

75
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,960
What are you looking for?

76
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,712
I'm looking for the rest your posse...

77
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:29,465
that's going to keep me
from ripping you a new asshole.

78
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,135
I will pretend for the moment
that you meant that in a nice way.

79
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,846
But I am warning you,
I'm about to lose my temper.

80
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,224
Now, I want you boys to shake hands.

81
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,143
Go on.

82
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,606
There. See?

83
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:49,443
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

84
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:54,907
It's always best to shake hands,
unless someone just sneezed into it...

85
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,745
or if they have a stump.
That could be a little weird.

86
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:02,748
All right, now go on, everybody.
Get back to class.

87
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:04,250
Cross me again, Griffy-boy...

88
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,669
and even Mr. Rogers here
won't be able to save your ass.

89
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:09,296
- Go on. Bye.
-Let's go, dogs.

90
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,383
Gentlemen, I believe classes are this way.

91
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:14,885
They're not at school here anymore.

92
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:17,638
- Are you in school here?
-Yeah.

93
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:21,183
- First day?
-No, not really. I was--

94
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:25,104
Mine, too. I'm a new teacher, Mr. Clark.
What's your name?

95
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:28,315
- Griff McReynolds.
-Nice to meet you, Griff.

96
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,069
You know, son,
I remember my first day at school.

97
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:34,613
Hope you live through this one, chump.

98
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:36,949
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

99
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:41,328
<i>Today begins sexual awareness week.
Please contact Nurse Johnson in the hall.</i>

100
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:44,123
Here you go, you little slut.

101
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,625
Excuse me. I'm looking for Room 134.

102
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,295
Thank you.

103
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:52,464
<i>Keep moving. I repeat, keep moving.</i>

104
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,758
<i>Pick up that can.</i>

105
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:57,803
<i>Where are you going?
The little girls' room is that way.</i>

106
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,222
<i>Hey, take off those colours.</i>

107
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,641
<i>Yeah, you. Lose the cigarette.</i>

108
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:08,647
<i>Take a hike, Gumby.
Get rid of the sunglasses.</i>

109
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:11,609
Excuse me. But this kind of behaviour...

110
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,778
I'd bet the principal would frown
on this sort of thing.

111
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,906
Evelyn Doyle, Principal.

112
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:21,118
Look, pinhead, I don't know
what nursery school you come from...

113
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:23,454
but here you screw up, you die.

114
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:27,500
Every bad kid in the city
is dumped into our laps.

115
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,668
Excuse me, Ms. Doyle, with all due respect...

116
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:32,129
I don't think there is such a thing
as a bad kid.

117
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:35,841
At least, they don't start off that way.
They just need someone they can relate to...

118
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:39,637
and I can reach them.
I know what's def, what's wack...

119
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,014
what's jam, what's straight-up booty.

120
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:45,518
Mr. Clark,
how long have you been teaching here?

121
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:47,728
Twenty minutes!

122
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:52,191
I've been here over 20 years.
Don't you question my authority on this.

123
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,026
Excuse me.

124
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,115
Pardon me.

125
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:02,535
Are you having a hard time
finding your way around?

126
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,411
Yes. I'm looking...

127
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,580
for Room 134.

128
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,751
- Hi. Victoria Chapell.
-Richard Clark.

129
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:14,046
Nice to meet you, Mr. Clark.
It's down this way.

130
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,882
What do you teach, Ms. Chapell?

131
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:20,135
I'm Principal Doyle's
administrative assistant.

132
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:24,348
Drama coach. You did say Room 134?

133
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:25,975
Yes.

134
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:31,647
This is it. All of our classrooms
are in dire need of repair.

135
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,442
Ever since the legislature passed
that "Three F's and You're Out" law...

136
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:37,319
a lot of schools have closed.

137
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:40,322
The school board decided
it just wasn't worth it.

138
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:42,992
I guess they just gave up on these kids.

139
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:46,495
So we've been squeezed for money
ever since.

140
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:49,081
We've been forced to--

141
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:55,713
Guess I'll get that later.

142
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:59,550
Mr. Clark, are you by any chance related
to Thaddeus Clark...

143
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,302
Headmaster at the Wellington School?

144
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,387
Yeah. He's my father.

145
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:07,016
Every school in the district
uses his book as a faculty primer.

146
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:11,145
You know,
I don't see the family resemblance.

147
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:13,981
Most people think I take after my mum.

148
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,235
Look at this place.
Boy, it has great character.

149
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:22,281
Sure, it needs a little paint and plaster...

150
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,535
and floorboards...

151
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,209
and pest control.

152
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:35,336
With a little elbow grease--

153
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:41,634
Jesus!

154
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:46,138
And some new wiring,
she'll be back to shape in no time.

155
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,892
Smell those seats.

156
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:54,939
It says, "Teach me. I want to learn."

157
00:12:56,815 --> 00:13:00,277
- You must think I'm a silly idealist.
-No.

158
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,490
I really admire your dedication.

159
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:08,869
Your wife must be very proud of you.

160
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:11,372
Actually, I'm not married.

161
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:13,874
I find that surprising.

162
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:18,546
It's pretty hard to be married,
if you've never had a steady girlfriend.

163
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:23,843
I'm much too busy with work
to think about much else other than work.

164
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,638
That's very admirable.

165
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:32,852
The last time I heard someone talk like that
was old Mr. Riley.

166
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:36,188
He was head of the History Department
until last semester.

167
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:37,731
Retired?

168
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,776
If you can call
being beaten to death retiring.

169
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,111
Coffee?

170
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,367
The lounge.

171
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:55,416
- I'm going in. Cover me.
-Good luck in Home Ec, Lou.

172
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:03,174
It's a little early to start drinking,
don't you think?

173
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:04,633
Who stops?

174
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:12,892
Hi, I'm Richard Clark.
I'm a new history teacher here.

175
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:19,773
- What department do you teach in?
-I don't know. Something on the third floor.

176
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,320
Richard, I'd like you to meet somebody.

177
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:28,407
This is Bernie Raveling,
our athletic director, and...

178
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,618
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Raveling.

179
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:33,871
- Letting the moustache grow in, I see.
-Richard--

180
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:36,707
From the looks of the stubble,
I'd say it's going to be a beaut.

181
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,584
I had one in college myself.

182
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:42,213
Richard, that's Ms. Wells,
the girls' gym teacher.

183
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,927
Did I mention how attractive you look,
Ms. Wells?

184
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,472
That blue sweat suit really brings out
the colour of your eyes.

185
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,058
You coming on to me, pickle dick?

186
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,352
No. I'd never dream of it.

187
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:00,940
- Not good enough for you?
-Well, it's been a real pleasure.

188
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:06,403
They should really fix the lighting in here.

189
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,745
<i>AH right, settle down, you people.</i>

190
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,456
<i>Knock it off. Quiet!</i>

191
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:19,834
<i>I want quiet.</i>

192
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,257
<i>It's a new semester.
That means new I.D. cards...</i>

193
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:30,052
<i>strip searches and fresh fingerprints.</i>

194
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:32,763
Shut up!

195
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,562
<i>As you know, Mr. Amott...</i>

196
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:42,982
<i>our assistant principal, is still missing.</i>

197
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:46,610
<i>If you know of his whereabouts,
or if you have him...</i>

198
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:48,737
<i>contact me immediately.</i>

199
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:52,241
<i>And also don't forget,
in less than two months...</i>

200
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:56,203
<i>the state will administer
the Academic Proficiency Test.</i>

201
00:15:56,704 --> 00:16:01,750
<i>Anyone planning on going to college
is required to take these exams.</i>

202
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:05,004
<i>Don't forget Career Day on Fridays.</i>

203
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:08,174
<i>The United States Marines
and the Michigan Militia...</i>

204
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:10,843
<i>will have recruiters here on campus.</i>

205
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,053
<i>AH right, listen up!</i>

206
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,306
<i>We have a new teacher.</i>

207
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:17,516
<i>His name is Richard Clark.</i>

208
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,393
<i>It's his first day.</i>

209
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:24,106
<i>Give him at least a week
before you do something terrible to him.</i>

210
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,775
<i>Mr. Clark, do you have anything to say?</i>

211
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,527
<i>Now, you all should know--</i>

212
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,321
Actually, yes.

213
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:37,953
<i>I was asked a while back,
what teaching meant to me.</i>

214
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:42,750
<i>My reward,
is being able to shape and mould...</i>

215
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,169
<i>agile young minds like yours.</i>

216
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,422
<i>Someday you will be the world's leaders.</i>

217
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:54,887
<i>But the important thing is,</i> I <i>see in</i> you...

218
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:57,389
<i>the future of America.</i>

219
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,433
You suck!

220
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,602
That's enough, miss!

221
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:06,941
She's the school's librarian.

222
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,068
Jeez, talk about low morale.

223
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:21,497
All right, please settle down.

224
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,926
There. That's more like it.

225
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:35,970
I know.

226
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:37,847
I'm the enemy.

227
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,015
I'm the "grown-up."

228
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:44,270
But, darn it, I was a kid once, too.

229
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,731
And I haven't led a choirboy's life.

230
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,734
I've got my share of parking tickets.

231
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:53,112
At a baseball game once...

232
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:57,616
I moved down to the expensive seats.

233
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,537
Yeah. I'm not proud of it.

234
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:05,249
In order to get to know you...

235
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,459
I've devised a little system.

236
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:09,086
When I call your name...

237
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,130
I would like you to stand up...

238
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:13,799
and then you tell me a little something
about yourself.

239
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:19,013
Natalie Thompson.

240
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:22,808
- Is there a Natalie Thompson here?
-I'm here.

241
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:25,186
- What's up, girl?
-Why are you late?

242
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,564
- Because the bell rang before I got here.
-Well--

243
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,239
All right. Before you came in, we were just
talking about sharing personal information.

244
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:39,783
Perhaps you can tell us something
about yourself.

245
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:43,204
For the last week,
I've had a yeast infection that's extremely--

246
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:45,039
Not that personal.

247
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:48,292
Something about what you enjoy doing.

248
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,002
I like writing poetry.

249
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,047
A poet. I love poetry.

250
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:56,759
Perhaps you have a nice one
you'd like to share with us.

251
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:58,010
Okay.

252
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:02,806
Here's one I wrote yesterday.

253
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:05,809
"Oh, hopelessness

254
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,938
"unrelenting, blood-drenched

255
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:12,358
"intestine-twisting hopelessness

256
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:17,863
"So thick and mucous-like
in a stinking, vomit-filled void

257
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:22,034
"I am but a rancid carcass on the highway

258
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,370
"Road kill for the maggots

259
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:28,123
"Floating in shark-filled bile,
like wildebeest entrails"

260
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,544
That's as far as I got.
I would have finished but...

261
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,130
I couldn't find anything
to rhyme with "festering drippage."

262
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:39,134
Well, thank you, Natalie.

263
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:42,346
Is it Anthony Jefferson?

264
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,223
Anferny.

265
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,016
I beg your pardon?

266
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,396
- Anferny.
-Anferny?

267
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:55,609
Anferny, I thought I wrote it down wrong.

268
00:19:57,027 --> 00:20:00,614
All right. Tell us a little something
about yourself, Anferny.

269
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:03,617
You know. I like chilling with my boys...

270
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,744
blazing up a fat blunt...

271
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:07,538
rizzeezing my mizzonkey...

272
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:09,707
hitting skins with my old lady...

273
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,918
hanging my ass over the line,
tagging freeway bridges.

274
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:16,297
I'm down with that poetry shit, too.
You want to hear?

275
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,841
- Sure.
-All right.

276
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:22,469
"My benevolence is upset
and so is my pride

277
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:25,139
"That's why I took my bitch

278
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:26,682
"for a ride

279
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:30,477
"I'm down with the bros
and I'm up on my shiznit

280
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:35,024
"because I love it when I'm just laid back
chilling with my bitch"

281
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,071
"Whichever one of them hoes I'm with"

282
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:44,325
<i>I call it, Love Can Be A Wonderful Thing.</i>

283
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,202
Thank you, Anferny.

284
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:51,040
That was quite romantic.

285
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,335
Julie Rubels. Miss Rubels?

286
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:57,004
That's Mrs. Rubels.

287
00:20:57,254 --> 00:21:00,007
See, right after I got out of prison,
I met Tito...

288
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,510
and that's when little Juan and Maria
came along.

289
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:09,558
I certainly hope
you learned a valuable lesson.

290
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:10,976
Yes.

291
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,481
Basically, as far as vasectomies go,
never use the home kit.

292
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,652
Thank you, Julie.

293
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:22,404
Griff McReynolds?

294
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,241
Where's Griff? Griff.

295
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,451
We had the pleasure
of meeting earlier today.

296
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,328
Hey, Griff, let me ask you something.

297
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:32,540
Where do you see yourself in, say, 20 years?

298
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,334
Living in your house, homes...

299
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:37,503
with your cracker ass buried
under the front porch.

300
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,266
Hi.

301
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:52,059
Excuse me.

302
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,233
Hi.

303
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:03,112
- How was your first day?
-Not bad. Not bad at all.

304
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:05,489
I think I may be reaching them.

305
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,450
Victoria?

306
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,870
Do you think
you could give me a ride home?

307
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:13,706
I seem to have misplaced my car.

308
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:18,210
Don't worry about it.
All the teachers lose their cars the first day.

309
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:21,297
Of course I'll give you a ride.

310
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:24,675
That is,
if you promise to help me chaperone...

311
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:26,552
the Welcome Back dance tonight.

312
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:29,847
Really?

313
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:33,225
I'd love to.

314
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:35,227
Great.

315
00:22:35,895 --> 00:22:38,439
So I'll meet you out in the parking lot
in five minutes?

316
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:39,773
Okay.

317
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,323
- Tripping, right?
-Right.

318
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:06,425
All right, peep this out, y'all.
We going to pump it up a little bit like this.

319
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:07,718
Yeah.

320
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:12,097
Listen, I have a record I want you to play.

321
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,893
Don't you think the kids would enjoy
a nice song with a melody?

322
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:17,978
What you got, homes?

323
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:21,273
It is a rare, one-of-a-kind, original pressing.

324
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:24,652
Yeah? All right, man.
I'm going to put it on here for you.

325
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:26,779
- Thanks.
-No problem.

326
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:51,971
Yo, man, these jams be kicking, man.

327
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:55,391
You got any more of this funky fresh shit
lying around the crib?

328
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,938
- Hey.
-Hi.

329
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:03,566
You're in my history class, right?

330
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:06,151
- I'm Griff McReynolds.
-Natalie Thompson.

331
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:09,113
That was a pretty nice poem
you read in class today, Natalie.

332
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:11,365
- Thanks.
-How do you think of all that stuff?

333
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:13,534
I try not to, you know?

334
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:16,620
Is it true you used to run the gang
before Paco?

335
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:19,582
Yeah, but I'm through with gangs. Word up.

336
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:23,419
I mean, in juvie I had time to do
some thinking and some reading.

337
00:24:23,502 --> 00:24:26,297
You're different from everybody else here.

338
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,758
Most of the boys I know,
they're all crude and immature.

339
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:33,053
Most of the time,
they just want to stare at girls' breasts.

340
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,598
- You know what I mean?
-Sorry. What?

341
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,100
This is my song.

342
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:41,854
- You want to bust one?
-I don't know. We just met.

343
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:45,149
Come on. It's just an innocent little dance.

344
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:47,860
Okay.

345
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:17,890
Yeah.

346
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:33,656
All right, boys, let's party.

347
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:36,992
Yo, Mr. DeMarco in the house. Beat it.

348
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,542
- Paco.
-What up?

349
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,503
What's the 411 on my shipment?

350
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:50,965
Same as always.
Mr. A's Restaurant, Friday nights.

351
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:54,343
You bring the cash. We bring the boot.
You know the drill.

352
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,847
You tell Mr. A to expect me.

353
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,183
I'll do that.

354
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:05,938
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got to go mingle with my customers.

355
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:08,107
See, real money talks.

356
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:11,026
Let's see if yours does.

357
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,321
I mean, there was a time...

358
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:18,242
when I tried all the self-help groups
like Outward Bound...

359
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:22,788
and that other one where a bunch of men
sit around a campfire naked...

360
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,040
beating drums and abusing themselves.

361
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,712
Then I tried drugs.
Prozac, Zantac, Monoxodil.

362
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:32,298
But in the end,
you know what I found worked for me?

363
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,841
Dim sum.

364
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:36,343
Whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed by life...

365
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,512
I just head to Chinatown.

366
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:42,933
Yo, Mr. Clark, Paco and his boys heading up
in here. You want us to serve them fools?

367
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:47,271
Look. Anferny, instead of using your fists...

368
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,523
try using this.

369
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,150
Head-butting?

370
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:54,695
Never mind.
Just pick a window and guard it.

371
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:56,864
Richard,
you're not really going to try and stop...

372
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,866
Paco and his gang from coming in, are you?

373
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:01,452
- They come to all the dances.
-Not anymore.

374
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:04,705
What if they got guns and knives
and everything?

375
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:07,583
Who'd bring guns and knives to a dance?

376
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:12,880
In that case,
maybe we'd better call the police.

377
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:17,134
No, wait. The last time they tried that,
four people ended up in the hospital.

378
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:20,930
I can see your point.
We can't have kids going to the hospital.

379
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:24,517
Who said anything about kids?
The cops were beaten senseless.

380
00:27:26,018 --> 00:27:27,436
All right.

381
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,315
You take care of the music. Anferny,
you and your guys, you come with me.

382
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:32,900
Let's go.

383
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:39,907
Say, nice leather jacket.

384
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,076
- Men's Warehouse?
-Shut up, teach.

385
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,787
We're coming in, so stand aside.

386
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,582
Not this time, gentlemen.
This dance is for Barry students only.

387
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,585
We're not gonna have any gangs
inside our school.

388
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,255
- Who's gonna stop us?
-My gang.

389
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:56,799
We already up inside the school.

390
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:59,051
You call them bunch of pussies a gang?

391
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:02,346
Look, Paco, if you're interested
in coming back to school...

392
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:03,931
-and working towards a career--
-Shut up!

393
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,267
Are you gonna move aside...

394
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,894
or am I gonna have to turn your eyebrows
into a moustache?

395
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,312
Paco...

396
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:15,693
-why don't you chill out, man?
-Stay out of this, Griff.

397
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,822
- Since when you been down with O.P.P?
-What you tripping about?

398
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:23,075
- You with my girl.
-I am not your girl, Paco.

399
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,911
- Since when?
-We went on one date.

400
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,164
If I had known
you were gonna rob that liquor store...

401
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,166
trust me, I never would have gone.

402
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:31,625
No one got hurt, did they?

403
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,670
Only 'cause the clerk was wearing
a bulletproof turban.

404
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:36,755
All right, that's enough.

405
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,300
Fine. I don't want you anyway,
you super freak.

406
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:41,218
You're a real jack-off, you know that?

407
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,765
That's enough. I mean it.

408
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:50,102
We're all civilised human beings here.

409
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,396
Certainly we can come up
with a compromise.

410
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:55,399
All right. I just got some fresh wheels.

411
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,526
How about a chickee run?

412
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,530
- You're a real idiot, you know?
-That's good. Chickee run.

413
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,282
Isn't that better than fighting?

414
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:06,160
Okay, everybody, let's go. Back to dancing.

415
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:10,164
- And we'll see you in, what?
-Ten minutes. Beck's Bluff.

416
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:12,917
- See you at the Bluff.
-Thanks, pal.

417
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,669
Chickee run.

418
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:22,551
See? There's always an intelligent way
to solve our differences.

419
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:26,138
My God, Richard, do you have any idea
what you've just done?

420
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,941
Get lost, punk.

421
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:47,368
All right.

422
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:52,122
First one to jump out of the car
before the edge of the cliff loses.

423
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,043
Now remember, no ramming, no swerving...

424
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:59,171
and absolutely no use of brakes at any time.

425
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:02,299
All right, listen up, guys. Here's the deal.

426
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,468
When I drop this scarf...

427
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,887
you boys are gonna go.

428
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,889
N°jumping the gun.

429
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,433
Ready...

430
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:19,608
set...

431
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,787
Se!

432
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,641
Richard, just promise me you'll be careful.

433
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:55,477
Remember some things are irreplaceable.

434
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:59,023
Irreplaceable?
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

435
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:04,278
I was talking about my car!

436
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,955
Hey.

437
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:22,421
Griff. Paco. Listen to me, boys.

438
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,840
Going fast never solved anything.

439
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,426
This is no way to resolve a dispute.

440
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,470
We can work this mess out.

441
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:31,847
I want you both to get out of your cars
right now...

442
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,725
and we'll settle this in an adult manner...

443
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:36,560
like a fistfight.

444
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:44,985
There. That's better.

445
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,691
Nobody panic.

446
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,193
I'm okay.

447
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,114
Here's the tip.
Nobody has to know about this.

448
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,783
Our little secret.

449
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,132
<i>Firefighters from all over
Southern California...</i>

450
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:52,636
<i>are still trying to contain the flames
that have blackened over 200 acres...</i>

451
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,139
<i>and caused several blocks of homes
to be evacuated.</i>

452
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,976
<i>The charred remains of three cars
were found in the rubble.</i>

453
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:02,479
<i>One, a classic Corvette,
has been described by experts...</i>

454
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,607
<i>as being irreplaceable.</i>

455
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:09,653
I think we've heard enough bad news
for one day.

456
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,655
What we've been hearing are rumours...

457
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,451
that some of our students
may have been involved in this fire.

458
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:17,828
And very possibly, a teacher.

459
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,125
You wouldn't know anything about that,
would you, Mr. Clark?

460
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,127
No.

461
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:27,129
You know, Clark...

462
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,717
I've been thinking
that maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

463
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,637
I happen to be a woman
who has strong opinions...

464
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,515
about how this place should be run.

465
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:41,310
It's just possible
that you and I don't see eye-to-eye...

466
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:43,854
on our philosophies of education.

467
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,650
I've always been a woman of few words.

468
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,277
No miracles.

469
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:51,987
Dumping ground.

470
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:55,157
I'll need more words than that, ma'am.

471
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,412
All right. I'll spell it out for you.

472
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:03,290
Our primary job here...

473
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:08,087
is to warehouse these delinquents,
until such time as they can be released...

474
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,422
into the general population...

475
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,633
or sent to a real jail.

476
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:17,596
Look, although I may admire
and even appreciate your ideals...

477
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,015
I know what works, Mr. Clark.

478
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,143
I know what to expect from these kids...

479
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,938
and they know what to expect from me.

480
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:31,110
My hope is that you can fit into the pattern
here at Barry.

481
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:34,029
I guess I should get to class.

482
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,408
I've certainly enjoyed our chat...

483
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:40,870
and I'll take everything you've said to heart.

484
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,038
Clark!

485
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,623
Mr. Clark...

486
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,837
Chickee run, man. Yeah.

487
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,257
- Mr. Clark, you were smoking last night.
-Thanks, Anferny.

488
00:34:54,216 --> 00:34:55,467
My man!

489
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,346
For you, Mr. Clark.

490
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,016
Richard, you forgot your briefcase.

491
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,227
How sweet. Is that for me?

492
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,771
Sorry about your car.

493
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,583
All right. I want everyone to take their...

494
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,002
seats.

495
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:35,174
Today, I'd like to talk about...

496
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,140
All right. I guess I won't need this anymore.

497
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:49,021
Let's begin, shall we?

498
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,441
Yesterday,
I was about to start with the Bill of Rights...

499
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,944
and what they mean to all of us.

500
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,531
Who can tell me about the Founding Fathers
and their doctrine?

501
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:18,008
Let me go, man.

502
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,594
That's not funny. Let go.

503
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,681
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

504
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:27,101
<i>This is Principal Doyle
welcoming you once again...</i>

505
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,645
<i>to Barry High': weekly Career Day.</i>

506
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:32,523

508
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:41,949
What's up, man?
I see you got a bright future ahead of you.

509
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,245
You wouldn't understand, Paco.
I'm trying to help my family.

510
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:49,957
See now, this is the shit
that's going to feed your family, not some...

511
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,667
rinky-dink job.

512
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,336
Go ahead, man. I'm sure you could use it.

513
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,215
I got a big deal going down, all right,
with DeMarco at Mr. A's Restaurant.

514
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,926
- You remember the zip code, right?
-Yeah.

515
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,803
I need a good mule.

516
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:06,265
- Are you up for it?
-I can't even think about that right now.

517
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:10,019
Who's asking you to think?
Ask Alonzo here. Thinking hurts.

518
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,447
Richard?

519
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:23,282
Hello?

520
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,813
You tell your boyfriend this is only
the beginning. He better back off.

521
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,440
Get your hands off of me!

522
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,944
Come on, I know you want this.
I read Mike Tyson's book.

523
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,798
Javier, come quick and bring your tools.

524
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,601
Don't worry, Victoria, I'm here.

525
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,522
Let me handle this.

526
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,611
Here, put this on.

527
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,830
Animal.

528
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,916
Get off of her.

529
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,756
Here, sit down.

530
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,557
Victoria.

531
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,393
No. Stay away from me.

532
00:39:57,102 --> 00:39:59,772
-It's okay. It's me.
-I know.

533
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,775
What the hell's going on here?

534
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,610
I was attacked.

535
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,738
Dressed like that, what do you expect?

536
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,573
And alone with him.

537
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,784
It wasn't just me. There were three of us.

538
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,245
That makes it all better.

539
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:18,499
No. I was wrestling with the other guy.
He was trying to have sex with her.

540
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,044
I don't care what your arrangement was,
or how it went wrong.

541
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:23,963
Now you listen to me, Clark.

542
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,174
Either you shape up,
or I'll bounce you out of here...

543
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,468
faster than a homo at Fort Dix.

544
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,309
- Does it hurt here?
-A little.

545
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,689
And here?

546
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,778
- How about here?
-I can't feel your hand.

547
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,115
That's because I'm touching myself.

548
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,162
I better get you something to wear.
You have a T-shirt around here anywhere?

549
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,663
Top drawer.

550
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,672
Here we are.

551
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,385
Poor thing. You must be exhausted.

552
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,806
Let me loosen that bra and get you some air.

553
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,642
Richard...

554
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,563
Victoria, I'm sorry about all this.
It's all my fault.

555
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:26,358
If they think by attacking you
they can scare me off, they're nuts.

556
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:30,112
They can attack you all they want.
I'm gonna get through to these kids.

557
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,948
Sure, getting them to come to class,
it's a small victory...

558
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,494
-but it isn't enough.
-Richard, they have to want to learn.

559
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,872
That's exactly my point.
And I think Griff is the key.

560
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,999
He seems to be a leader. Now...

561
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,377
if I could just reach him,
I could get through to the others--

562
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,463
You have to be careful.

563
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,090
If you raise their expectations...

564
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,344
their hopes, and their dreams,
and then you fail?

565
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,387
It's worth the risk.

566
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,306
These are all basically good kids.

567
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:01,018
They deserve the same experiences
that we all had in high school.

568
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,355
Dating, going to proms,
and begging for sex.

569
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,982
Richard, you have to trust me on this one.

570
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,110
I'm your friend.

571
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,906
I'm more than a friend.

572
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,451
To me?

573
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,955
Yes. Why not?

574
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:26,961
Well, no one who's ever looked like you
has ever looked at me.

575
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,630
That's their loss.

576
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,137
You know, I have never been very good
at relationships.

577
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,393
In fact, most of mine always ended with,
you know:

578
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,813
"Hey, what are you doing in bed
with that other woman?"

579
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,732
And that was me talking.

580
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,530
Victoria, I do find you very attractive.

581
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,830
What's wrong?

582
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,499
I'm scared.

583
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,378
It's okay, you can be on top.

584
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,381
No, it isn't that.

585
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,512
Trouble just seems to follow me around.

586
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,391
Everywhere I go, there's always someone
looking to bust my balls.

587
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,351
Don't worry, Richard.

588
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,104
Your balls are safe with me.

589
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,617
My God, you're a virgin.

590
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,036
No, I still have my panties on.

591
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,377
- I still can't...
-Richard, I'm over here.

592
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,106
Driver, I'm the next stop.

593
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,069
Forget it, pal.
We don't stop in this neighbourhood.

594
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,793
<i>GMT?</i>

595
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,008
- Here you go, darling.
-Thanks, Sam.

596
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,970
Watch your back.

597
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,267
Here's your cola, Griff.

598
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,649
- G riff.
-M r. Clark.

599
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,280
- What are you doing here?
-I live here.

600
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,450
I realise a lot of these men do,
but you can get help for this, son.

601
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,163
No. I mean my mom and I
live in an apartment upstairs.

602
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,418
Listen, Griff.
The reason I came here is because I--

603
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,964
I sense that you want to make something
of yourself...

604
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,176
and if you help me,
we can turn the school around.

605
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,678
Why me, man?
You'll have to get somebody else.

606
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,305
Who do you think is watching my little...

607
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,141
brothers and sisters
while my moms is working? I'm all they got.

608
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,727
You remind me a lot of myself
when I was your age...

609
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,063
except I was white and had
both parents and lived in the suburbs...

610
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,733
and I didn't have any brothers or sisters.

611
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,944
Maybe you remind me of somebody else.

612
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,740
Griff, don't you have a dream?

613
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,828
- You wouldn't be interested, man.
-Sure I would. Tell me.

614
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,459
- Promise you won't tell anyone.
-You have my word.

615
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,674
- I want to go to college.
-College? You got to be...

616
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,970
I'm sorry. Listen, Griff, I'll make you a deal.

617
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,723
You help me get these kids to learn...

618
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:12,228
and I promise you, I will do everything
in my power to get you into college.

619
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,605
Don't try to play me, Mr. Clark.

620
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,817
I've been promised stuff before
that hasn't come true.

621
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,237
I'm saying, where would I get the money
for college from?

622
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,156
- You ever hear of scholarships?
-Yeah!

623
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,616
Well...

624
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,744
you probably won't get any of those.

625
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,831
But there are plenty of other ways.
I promise you.

626
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,624
Don't just take my word for it, all right?

627
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,918
You go home, you talk it over
with your mother.

628
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,419
I'm sure she'll agree with me.

629
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,713
Here.

630
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,719
Listen, Griff,
you don't have to live in a community...

631
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:49,139
infested with crimes, and drugs, and gangs.

632
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:54,061
You don't have to end up in some sleazy bar
with a bunch of washed-up bums...

633
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,939
watching some over-the-hill stripper
expose herself...

634
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,608
for a few measly dollars in her G-string.

635
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,670
Okay. Now, in the next six weeks...

636
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:24,300
lam gonna try and cram as much knowledge
into your brains as is humanly possible.

637
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,971
Or as space will allow.

638
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,308
Now, this is your textbook for the semester.

639
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,813
They open like this.

640
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,652
Now all of you try it.

641
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,227
Good.

642
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,355
All right. Let's get to work.

643
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,816
Maybe we should start
with some basic English.

644
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,318
Now, who can give me a complete sentence?

645
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,822
Yo, you wack punk,
you be going down the hard way.

646
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,533
All right, that's a good sentence.
Let's examine it.

647
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:34,328
"Yo" is a common colloquial greeting...

648
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,496
comma...

649
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,375
"you wack punk...

650
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,545
"you be going..."

651
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:46,090
This is just bad syntax.
Who can give me another sentence?

652
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,552
- Julie.
-I think my water broke.

653
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,803
Good.

654
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,222
"I think..."

655
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,152
- What's the capital of Nebraska?
-Lincoln.

656
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,445
- Right. Who freed the slaves?
-Lincoln.

657
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,448
Right. Charles Keating cooked the books
of what S and L?

658
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,992
- Lincoln.
-Yes.

659
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,494
- Who makes the best town car?
-Cadillac.

660
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,621
No.

661
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,458
- Lincoln!
-Amazing.

662
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,544
Now we're getting somewhere.

663
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:36,140
You and three of your G's
are on someone else's turf.

664
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,643
You're cruising along in your fly ride
about 20 miles per.

665
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:43,397
There's a posse of eight homies just sitting
in front of their crib, they're just...

666
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,608
chilling on the porch
playing some fresh jams.

667
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,652
- Who they got on the box?
-I think they're riffing with Tag Team...

668
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,780
maybe some Ice, Snoop, Biggie,
Junior MAFIA, whatever.

669
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,408
They decide that they want to throw down.

670
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:58,037
So, you and your boys, you pile out
of your hooptie for the face-off.

671
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,333
They have six baseball bats and two chains.

672
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,668
You have three brass knuckles...

673
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,838
and two sawed-off pool cues,
you know, jimmy sticks.

674
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,841
Now, what I want to know is
what is the ratio...

675
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,385
of metal weapons to wooden ones?

676
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,269
Over here, over here, Mr. Clark, Julie knows.

677
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:51,090
Okay, pop quiz. Who was the first president
to use the telephone?

678
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,466
- Anferny.
-Nixon.

679
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,634
No. Griff.

680
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:54,760
- Garfield.
-Yes.

681
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,220
First president to be on television?

682
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,513
Anferny.

683
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,391
- Johnny Carson.
-No, he was never president. Natalie.

684
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,017
- Eisenhower.
-Yes.

685
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:05,229
Who was the last president to blow chunks
on a Japanese head of state?

686
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,522
Anferny.

687
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,940
- Bush?
-Yes!

688
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,075
Good day, Ms. Doyle.

689
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,082
Good morning, Ms. Doyle.

690
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,380
You looking fine, Ms. Doyle.

691
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,946
Mr. Arnott? Where have you been?

692
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,574
They released me.

693
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,498
Everyone...

694
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:09,919
state law prohibits Mr. Clark
from being here today, so he's at home...

695
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,839
probably a little nervous,
but I'm sure rooting for all of you.

696
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:15,466
All right, here we go.

697
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,302
The Academic Proficiency Test.

698
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:22,681
You have eight hours in which to complete
this exam. Good luck to all of you.

699
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,309
Begin work now.

700
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,403
<i>Every day people are discovering
just how fun and easy it is...</i>

701
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,406
<i>to get a precision-layered haircut
with the incredible...</i>

702
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,867
<i>Flowbee Precision Haircutting System.</i>

703
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:43,911
<i>Don't be fooled by imitators.</i>

704
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,463
<i>Flowbee cuts from
a half-inch to six inches long.</i>

705
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,810
<i>Can't do it wrong.
Get a close-up on this. Squeeze.</i>

706
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,020
<i>Go ahead. Show your abs.</i>

707
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,167
Shit.

708
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,816
All right, time's up.

709
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,111
Come on. Time's up. Close your booklets.

710
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,906
I'm sure you all did very well.

711
00:54:02,198 --> 00:54:04,825
Scores will be posted
at the end of this week.

712
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:13,000
How do you think you did on the test?

713
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,754
I don't know. For the first time in my life,
I feel like I did something right.

714
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:17,922
Me, too.

715
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,466
- Check this out.
-What is it?

716
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,761
It's my future. Remember that college
I was telling you about?

717
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,846
- Yeah.
-They wrote me back yesterday.

718
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:29,099
- Yeah.
-Now I feel like I got a real chance to get in.

719
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,102
Guess I owe a lot to Mr. Clark?

720
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:35,606
Yeah, you know, I think all the kids
pretty much feel the same way.

721
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,399
I mean, think about it.

722
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:40,694
We could both end up
at the same school together.

723
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,782
Griff, this is the happiest
lever remember being.

724
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:48,285
It's the first time in my life I haven't prayed
for a gas line to rupture...

725
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,579
under my building while I was smoking.

726
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:53,582
Natalie, I'm glad you're happy.

727
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,752
Come on.
There's something I want you to see.

728
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:57,878
Okay.

729
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,215
Mr. Clark has taken this place on
as a special project.

730
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,301
"Fie, my lord, fie!

731
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,264
"Out, damned spot. Out, I say."

732
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,641
Line!

733
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,102
"Who would have thought the old man
to have so much blood?"

734
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:17,022
"Who would have thought the old man
to have so much blood in him?"

735
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,321
Take it off!

736
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,830
Hustle up, man. Come on, hurry up.

737
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,750
Yeah, sweet.

738
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:41,213
This ought to take care of our little problem.

739
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:43,132
Let's get out of here, Paco.

740
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,186
Hey, give it a rest.

741
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,398
Everyone, I just want to say
before the test scores arrive...

742
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:04,320
that I am so proud of all of you.

743
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,746
Well?

744
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,583
As I expected,
every student in this class failed.

745
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,462
The lowest scores in the country.

746
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,925
- But there must be some mistake.
-That's right.

747
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:30,262
And you're it. See for yourself.
Figures don't lie.

748
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,974
We're not dealing
with Rhodes scholars here.

749
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:38,103
It's time I just accepted what I am
and get on with my life.

750
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,357
No, G riff, wait.

751
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:44,151
See what you've done?

752
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,948
I told you to leave them at the bottom
of the barrel, where they belong.

753
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,324
Griff, wait.

754
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,787
Consider yourself terminated
as of right now.

755
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,247
Natalie, wait.

756
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,499
Chuckie, wait.

757
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:03,462
Wait, Ms. Doyle,
you're making a huge mistake.

758
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:06,507
Mr. Clark has helped this school.
He's a good teacher.

759
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,760
And I'm not just saying that
because we slept together.

760
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,807
Clean out your desk by the end of the day.

761
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,363
- Richard, wait.
-No.

762
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,949
You were right all along.

763
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:35,661
I didn't know what I was getting into
with these kids.

764
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,622
Richard.

765
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,502
I'm out of here.

766
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,380
What's wrong with all of you?

767
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,466
Have you forgotten
how much Mr. Clark has helped us?

768
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,304
You had a D average
before Mr. Clark started tutoring you.

769
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,723
Now you're on the honour roll.

770
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,518
And this boy. Everyone thought he had
Tourette's syndrome until Mr. Clark...

771
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:02,271
discovered he was
a Hindu exchange student.

772
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,710
You suck!

773
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:30,758
You can come back.
Look at me. I'm living proof.

774
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,221
Call me.

775
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,225
Richard, wait!

776
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:40,976
Richard.

777
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:54,281
I'm telling you,
I'm really worried about Richard.

778
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:56,575
I've been calling his house
for the past three days...

779
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:58,077
and I keep getting the same message:

780
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,788
"Hi. I'm not here, and I may never be again."

781
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:01,956
Julie?

782
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:06,210
Buddy up with a mangy dog
or a small child.

783
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,754
Hey, Nat, are you okay?

784
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:13,259
- I'm afraid Griff's gonna join Pacca-'s gang.
-Come on.

785
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:14,844
Check this out.

786
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:19,265
Word on the street is Paco and his little
punk dogs slipped those mentals we took.

787
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:24,353
What I'm saying is, they switched the tests.
That's why everybody flunked.

788
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:27,690
You know, you guys.
I probably didn't need no help.

789
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:31,610
- Oh, my God, this is awful.
-Then we just got to find Mr. Clark.

790
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:35,197
Yeah, but where?
Where do you find a man that depressed?

791
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,367
Wait a minute. Dim sum.

792
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:40,828
Chinatown. Come on.

793
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:48,919
Okay, this is it. Julie, Natalie...

794
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,881
-why don't you two head down that way?
-Okay.

795
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:55,217
Anferny, go down to the south end
of the block, and I'll go down this way.

796
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,635
All right.

797
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,308
Please, let this be the one.

798
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:29,376
Richard,
what are you trying to do to yourself?

799
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,296
Richard, snap out of it.
Don't you recognise me?

800
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:34,089
Mum?

801
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,467
No, it's me.

802
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:43,015
Father O' Flannery?

803
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,320
Mister?

804
01:00:57,154 --> 01:01:00,407
You okay? Mister, you okay?

805
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:04,745
This girl over there, she asked about you.
Come. Now.

806
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,498
- Richard, thank God.
-Victoria?

807
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:11,043
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I didn't know you drank.

808
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,045
I drank?

809
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:16,215
I thought it was just my pet gorilla here.

810
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:19,260
How many fingers?

811
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:25,975
Come on, Mr. Clark, snap out of it.
We got to get Griff out of that drug deal.

812
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:29,311
Maybe we should just
let the cops handle this.

813
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:33,399
That would be fine if I didn't mind waiting
20 years to see Griff again.

814
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,943
Don't worry. I'll just go in and get him.

815
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,320
Mr. Clark, you can't just go in there
and be like:

816
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:43,617
"Okay, Griff, we're going home,"
else you gonna be going home in a box.

817
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,786
The only way we're going to get Griff
out of there...

818
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,289
is you got to show up in the back room
with the cash.

819
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,499
You got the cash, you the man.

820
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:54,128
- Where am I gonna get the cash?
-Man, DeMarco gonna be there.

821
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:57,131
What you think he carry in his briefcase?
Food stamps?

822
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:00,718
Your job is to make his cash your cash.

823
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:11,479
- Did you get it?
-it's all in there.

824
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:16,442
Good.

825
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:19,153
We just got time to eat.

826
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:24,366
All right, everybody, wait here.

827
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,622
<i>- I'll</i> handle this.
- You not out in 20 minutes...

828
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:32,333
me and my G's is coming in after you,
straight up.

829
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:36,295
Go in there and represent, Mr. Clark.
You can do it.

830
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:39,089
I can do this.

831
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:45,304
- What are you doing here?
-I'm here to help you.

832
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:48,265
Richard, if anything happens,
I want to be here with you.

833
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,267
Thanks.

834
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:55,147
How are we gonna know
which one is DeMarco?

835
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:58,984
- We'll just take a wild guess.
-Where?

836
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,945
Come on.

837
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:10,329
<i>- Someday you will be the world's leaders.
-You suck!</i>

838
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,042
Where you going?

839
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:18,504
It's a mistake, man. I can't do this.

840
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,175
I thought we settled this, Gritty-boy.

841
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,595
You better decide right now. You in or out?

842
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:29,807
- I ain't asking again.
-Define "in or out."

843
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:34,353
In, you're with us, and out, you're dead.

844
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,273
Works for me.

845
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,700
Where the hell's our waiter?

846
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,910
Good evening, gentlemen...

847
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:53,414
and welcome to Mr. A's
fine dining establishment.

848
01:03:54,415 --> 01:03:58,878
I'm Zack. I'll be your waiter this evening,
and this is my trainee, Paula.

849
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,631
I'm an Aries.
I enjoy water sports and dancing.

850
01:04:02,715 --> 01:04:05,217
- And my hobbies are origami--
-Enough small talk.

851
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:07,303
Just bring us two thick T-bones.

852
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:09,388
Yes, sir.

853
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:13,142
Would you like those
with or without the bones?

854
01:04:15,603 --> 01:04:18,606
And a couple of glasses of water.

855
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:21,775
All right.
Let me tell you about our water then.

856
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,778
It comes from the Los Angeles aqueduct...

857
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:28,032
where it flows down
a lovely cement channel on a bed of--

858
01:04:28,115 --> 01:04:32,203
I don't care where it came from.
Just bring it to us.

859
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,121
I'll take that. It's his birthday.

860
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:36,582
Would anyone care
for some desserts this evening?

861
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:39,960
Look, you little weasel.
Just bring us what we asked for.

862
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:43,631
Unless you want me to stick
this bread stick up your ass.

863
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:45,674
It sure would taste better if you didn't.

864
01:04:47,343 --> 01:04:49,595
You might want to try buttering it first.

865
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:05,069
Hey, stand back.

866
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:08,113
Come on. We've got to change disguises.

867
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:19,959
You ready?

868
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,922
Yeah, but unfortunately
we've got this other thing we gotta do first.

869
01:05:25,381 --> 01:05:27,383
Let's see what's in this thing.

870
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:28,801
Jesus!

871
01:05:29,552 --> 01:05:30,761
Hurry.

872
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,891
Manny, zap that sauce for me, will you?

873
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,977
Got it.

874
01:05:48,863 --> 01:05:50,573
Now, what do you want?

875
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,078
I'm here to see Mr. A.

876
01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:57,705
Who the hell are you?

877
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:01,542
I'm Mr. B.

878
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:07,756
Mr. D couldn't make it. He's out with Mr. C.

879
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:12,178
You're early.

880
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:28,777
DeMarco's early.

881
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:31,447
Say what? You?

882
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:36,118
Mr. Clark, Miss Chapell,
what are you doing here?

883
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,246
No need to be so formal, boys.

884
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,749
We're not in school anymore.

885
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:45,836
Two seconds you gonna be
one dead teacher. How's that for formal?

886
01:06:46,337 --> 01:06:49,256
Now, we work for DeMarco,
buying and selling drugs.

887
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,176
We're lowlife scumbags. Just like you.

888
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:56,263
- What are you talking about?
-What better cover than...

889
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:58,307
a teacher and a secretary?

890
01:06:58,641 --> 01:07:00,559
Administrative assistant.

891
01:07:01,602 --> 01:07:03,229
Yes, all right.

892
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:07,900
All right, enough of this small talk.
I've got business with Mr. A. Where is he?

893
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,360
I'm right here.

894
01:07:12,947 --> 01:07:15,324
- Clark?
-Ms. Doyle?

895
01:07:15,908 --> 01:07:18,244
Around here they call me Mr. A.

896
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:19,787
Mister?

897
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:22,581
I inherited the business
from my late husband.

898
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,626
- I'm shocked.
-What?

899
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:28,337
That a woman can run a business?

900
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,714
No. That you were ever married.

901
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:35,803
All right. Let's do it.

902
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:39,014
What exactly is she doing here?

903
01:07:40,015 --> 01:07:41,642
She's my bitch.

904
01:07:46,981 --> 01:07:49,400
Well, my significant other.

905
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,653
We've been slapping skins
for quite some time now.

906
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:57,491
You say you work for DeMarco.
Why should I believe you?

907
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:00,786
Why would I have his briefcase
unless I was working for him?

908
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,788
That doesn't prove anything.

909
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:05,624
You could have seen him
down in the restaurant...

910
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:09,170
dressed up like a waiter,
created some kind of diversion...

911
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:12,006
while she snatched it from under the table.

912
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,718
That's a little far-fetched, don't you think?

913
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:19,930
Wait a minute. Think about it.
You think he's capable of all that?

914
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:23,225
Hey, all right.

915
01:08:23,309 --> 01:08:25,311
What's the big idea?

916
01:08:25,478 --> 01:08:28,689
- You work out?
-All right. Knock it off.

917
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:35,196
I say we off him now,
and then do what we want with their bodies.

918
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:37,740
Easy, Paco, easy.

919
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:41,619
So, you like getting high, Clark?

920
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:44,246
Who doesn't?

921
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:47,917
Then perhaps you'd like to sample
the finest crank in town.

922
01:08:48,626 --> 01:08:52,880
Sure. Load me up a spike.
Let's get this party into gear.

923
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:59,178
- Look man, he's clean. No tracks.
-I take mine in the ass.

924
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:07,520
Got used to it as a kid. Shots.

925
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:11,190
You're starting to piss me off, man.

926
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:14,026
Maybe you don't have enough holes
in your head already.

927
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:17,571
Excuse me.
Something seems to be riding up here.

928
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:22,243
What's going on there?

929
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:24,995
Nothing I know rides up that high.

930
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,122
Here.

931
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,125
Tie off.

932
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:42,555
You really should have someone
look at that. It could be malignant.

933
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:45,724
Quit stalling.
We don't want to be here all night.

934
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:49,103
Here's looking at you, kid.

935
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:09,331
This shit be kicking.

936
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:13,919
Man, I'm wasted off my ass
and you're still ugly.

937
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,101
False alarm.

938
01:10:30,436 --> 01:10:32,813
Some idiot put a gun in the microwave.

939
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:35,483
Good stuff?

940
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:39,570
So what have you got to say for yourself?

941
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,113
Nothing, really.

942
01:10:41,697 --> 01:10:45,659
Except it's going to be an interesting
morning tomorrow, after my coffee.

943
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,787
I'll need at least two magazines.

944
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:54,710
- So it's all here?
-As far as you know.

945
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,129
- Half a million?
-Really?

946
01:10:57,922 --> 01:10:59,632
Yes, down to the penny.

947
01:11:00,007 --> 01:11:03,302
Now, I'll just take my stuff
and be on my way.

948
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:05,638
Wait here.

949
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:21,654
Griff, you got to get out of here.

950
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:24,782
You're throwing your life away,
messing around with these drug dealers.

951
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:27,535
- Look who's talking.
-No, he's not a real drug dealer.

952
01:11:27,618 --> 01:11:30,162
He's just pretending. He's here to save you.

953
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:34,166
- You risked your life to come here for me?
-Yeah, of course I did.

954
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,418
Well, not the risking-my-life part.

955
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:41,257
Anyway, look, Paco switched the tests, and
the police are probably already on their way.

956
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,133
We got to get out before--

957
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:49,390
- It's the waiter and his trainee.
-Yeah. Where the hell's our dinner?

958
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:53,477
You jughead.
They're the ones who stole our briefcase.

959
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:55,813
DeMarco, what's going on?

960
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:58,482
Is this your idea of a straight deal?

961
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:04,488
- We thought Clark was your guy.
-I never seen him before tonight.

962
01:12:09,827 --> 01:12:13,205
Hey. Another one of these,
one of us is gonna have an orgasm.

963
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:17,793
Clark, you never should have messed
with me. I don't want him found.

964
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,587
No problem.

965
01:12:30,723 --> 01:12:31,807
No.

966
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:36,103
- Come on, G's. They're down this way.
-You guys.

967
01:12:36,187 --> 01:12:37,438
In the house.

968
01:12:44,487 --> 01:12:47,364
Doyle is getting away. Stop her.

969
01:12:50,326 --> 01:12:52,745
Seems to me
we've got some unfinished business.

970
01:12:52,828 --> 01:12:54,997
You're forgetting a couple things,
aren't you?

971
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,084
- Yeah, what's that?
-Richard's not here to help you this time.

972
01:12:59,168 --> 01:13:00,503
And?

973
01:13:00,586 --> 01:13:02,671
I have a frozen pig's foot.

974
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:52,972
What's he doing?

975
01:13:56,225 --> 01:13:58,018
What's going on?

976
01:13:58,435 --> 01:13:59,770
Come on!

977
01:14:01,105 --> 01:14:04,233
Look! There's a bigger man,
and he's got a gun!

978
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:34,472
- Christ!
-Sorry.

979
01:14:37,933 --> 01:14:40,644
This was a new suit, pickle dick.

980
01:14:50,946 --> 01:14:52,490
Get back.

981
01:14:53,616 --> 01:14:57,661
What are you fossils staring at?
Eat your vegetables.

982
01:15:07,463 --> 01:15:12,218
Get back! I'm gonna walk out of here.
You punks get out of the way.

983
01:15:12,718 --> 01:15:16,722
I'm gonna count to three, and if you're
not moving, I'm gonna start shooting.

984
01:15:16,806 --> 01:15:18,390
Do what she says, kids.

985
01:15:18,474 --> 01:15:21,811
Chill, Mr. Clark.
She ain't shooting nothing but the breeze.

986
01:15:21,894 --> 01:15:25,481
You kids are even bigger boneheads
than I thought.

987
01:15:25,564 --> 01:15:28,651
And everybody knows it, too,
except for this fool.

988
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:32,154
You know, Ms. Doyle, that's just what you...

989
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:35,074
and people like you,
want everyone to think, isn't it?

990
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:38,828
That somehow, no matter what goes down,
we just can't cut it.

991
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:41,997
You use that as an excuse to hold us back...

992
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:46,418
but Mr. Clark showed us
that there is another way.

993
01:15:46,669 --> 01:15:48,462
Another way to flunk.

994
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:51,549
Think we failed that test? Listen up.

995
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:56,095
If x is 1?, plus the square root of 4,
minus 6...

996
01:15:56,428 --> 01:15:57,638
what's X?

997
01:15:58,013 --> 01:15:59,223
Thirteen.

998
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:02,893
Famous Russian author of
The Brothers Karamazov?

999
01:16:02,977 --> 01:16:04,478
Who is Dostoyevsky.

1000
01:16:04,562 --> 01:16:07,273
The Gadsden Purchase formed parts
of what two states?

1001
01:16:07,356 --> 01:16:09,525
Arizona and New Mexico.

1002
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:11,026
All right, I'll shoot him.

1003
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:13,195
- What's the capital of Ecuador?
-Quito!

1004
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:14,655
Back off! I mean it.

1005
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:18,242
- NASA's Apollo Program ended what year?
4975!

1006
01:16:18,325 --> 01:16:19,410
Stay away from me.

1007
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:21,954
Who was responsible
for the first moonwalk?

1008
01:16:22,037 --> 01:16:23,414
Michael Jackson!

1009
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:26,750
What did he say?

1010
01:16:28,127 --> 01:16:32,047
No, I'm just playing, man.
It was Louis Armstrong's brother, Neil.

1011
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:33,465
What group...

1012
01:16:33,549 --> 01:16:37,595
is responsible for the consumption
of the most doughnuts in Los Angeles?

1013
01:16:37,678 --> 01:16:38,888
- Police!
-Right.

1014
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:40,973
Nobody move. Get your hands up.

1015
01:16:41,557 --> 01:16:43,350
This isn't what it looks like.

1016
01:16:43,434 --> 01:16:45,102
Say hello to Mr. A.

1017
01:16:45,186 --> 01:16:48,147
So this is Mr. A.
We've been looking for him for years.

1018
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:49,815
