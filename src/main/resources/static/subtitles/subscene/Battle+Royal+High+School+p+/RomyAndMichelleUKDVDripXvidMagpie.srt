1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,395
Take this pink ribbon
off my eyes

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,638
I'm exposed
and it's no big surprise

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,469
Don't ya think I know
exactly where I stand

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,678
This world is forcing me
to hold your hand

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,270
'Cause I'm just a girl
Well, little old me

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,791
Well don't let me
out of your sight

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,195
Oh, I'm just a girl

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,197
All pretty and petite

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,757
So don't let me
have any rights

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,874
Oh I've had it
up to here

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,995
The moment that
I step outside

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,079
So many reasons
for me to run and hide

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,398
I can't do the little things
I hold so dear

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,230
'Cause it's all those
little things that I fear

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,239
'Cause I'm just a girl
I'd rather not be

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,638
'Cause they won't let me
drive late at night

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,753
Oh, I'm just a girl
Guess I'm some kind of freak

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,510
'Cause they all sit
and stare with their eyes

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,760
Oh, am I making myself clear

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,353
I'm just a girl

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,870
I'm just a girl in the world

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,788
- How much is this, Lori?
- It's very expensive.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,797
It's very expensive.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,275
Look, I got money
to spend in here.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,076
I don't think we have anything for you.
You're obviously in the wrong place.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,156
Please leave.

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,829
You know, even though we've watched
"Pretty Woman" like 36 times...

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,589
- I never get tired of making fun of it.
- Oh, I know.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,555
Aww, poor thing. Look!
They won't let her shop.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,514
Yeah, like those salesgirls in Beverly
Hills aren't bigger whores than she is.

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,471
I know!

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,117
Oh, my God, listen to that
sad, sad music as she leaves.

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,717
It's like, boo-hoo. Uhh.

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,190
But it is actually
kind of sad.

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,278
Anything you see here we can do, by the
way. Get ready to have some fun, okay?

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,436
- Okay.
- Mary Pat, Mary Kate,
Mary Frances, Tovah.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,791
- Let's see it, come on!
Let's see the outfit.
- How divine!

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,514
Exactly how obscene--

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,599
I just get really happy
when they finally let her shop.

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,351
Okay, so I have
nothing to wear.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
We don't even have time to make
anything new before we go out.

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,310
Well, what about this?

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,797
- Did you lose weight?
- Actually, I have been trying
this new fat-free diet I invented.

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,674
All I've had to eat for the past
six days are Gummi Bears,
jelly beans, and candy corns.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,236
God, I wish I had
your discipline.

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,954
- This is it
- Work this

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,116
- Diddy-bum diddy-bum pow
- Here it is

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,754
I can't believe
how cute I look!

49
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,759
I know! You know what? This is like
the cutest we've ever looked.

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,316
Oh, it's definitely the cutest.
Don't you love how we can just
say that to each other...

51
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,795
- and we know that we're
not being conceited?
- Oh, I know.

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,798
No, we're just
being honest.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,275
- Be my lover, Wanna be my lover
- Lover

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,836
Go ahead and take your time
Boy you gotta feel secure

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,838
Before I make you mine
Baby you have to be sure

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,236
You wanna be my lover
Wanna be my lover

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,830
God. I hope some cute guys get here
tonight. They were cute last night.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,077
- Oh, they were cute.
- Really cute!
- Oh!

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,919
- Hey, Michele! Romy!
- We'll take two Diet Cokes?

60
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,032
Right, with extra cherries.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

61
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,188
Okay. I have the yuckiest taste
in my mouth from those taquitos.

62
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,959
- Eeew.
- I hope I don't get indigestion.

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,629
Hey, remember that time I barfed
from bad Mexican food? It was so gross.

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,594
- Oh, my God, I hate
throwing up in public.
- Me too! Ooh.

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,352
I can't believe it. There are
absolutely no guys here tonight.

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,710
I know. None.

67
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
Come on, Michele, let's just
go dance with ourselves.

68
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,351
Okay.

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,277
Put your hands in the air

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,994
'Cause there's a party over here
So grab yourself a beer

71
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,271
And we could
get on with the world

72
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,109
Swear to God.
Sometimes I wish I were a lesbian.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,471
You wanna try and have sex sometime?
Just to see if we are?

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,832
What? Yeah, right, Michele.
Just the thought of having sex
with another woman creeps me out.

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,353
But if we're not married by
the time we're 30, ask me again.

76
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,119
- Okay.
- Tell me can you feel the

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,276
Masked girls comin'
with the fever, fever, fever

78
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,552
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,832
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,192
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

81
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,791
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

82
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,799
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,309
- Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
- Two-four-three.

84
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,353
- Stayin' alive
- Two-four-three.

85
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,675
Two-four-three.

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
Two, four, three.

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,959
Two, four, three.

88
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,517
Service.
Number 243.

89
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,437
It's beautiful.
Is that real wood?

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,471
During this century, boys.

91
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,554
Come on, Ramon. Quit jerking off
and bring the car around.

92
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,873
- It's about time.
- Mm. Romy!

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,673
You are looking hot today.

94
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,792
Yeah. That's because
I'm sweating like a pig in here.

95
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,559
Well, the air conditioning is
working in the service office.

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,629
You might wanna come by
and, uh, cool off later?

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,752
Yeah, Ramon.
That'll happen.

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,270
Sorry, ma'am.
He is such an asshole.

99
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,039
Mm.

100
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,720
- I'm in a hurry.
- Well--

101
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,233
I'm going as fast as I can,
Ms Mooney. Heather.

102
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,476
Heather Mooney?

103
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,670
From Sagebrush High
in Tucson?

104
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,996
- Yeah?
- It's Romy!

105
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,395
- Romy White!
- You're shittin' me.

106
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,876
No, this is so weird. I didn't
know you were living in L.A.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,276
Well, now that you know, will
we be getting together a lot?

108
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,353
So, God!
You're driving a new Jaguar?

109
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,835
- What do you do?
- Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?

110
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,748
- The ones that burn down real fast?
- "Twice the taste, in half the
time, for the gal on the go"?

111
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,873
I invented the
quick-burning paper.

112
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,837
Wow!

113
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,474
- You goin' to the reunion?
- What reunion?

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,273
Our ten-year high school
reunion in Tucson?

115
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,790
You're kidding me. It's been
ten years since high school?

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,357
- God. Where have I been?
- I'm stumped. Where?

117
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,790
- Anyway, are you going?
- I'd rather put this out in my ass.

118
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,676
I wonder why we didn't
get an invitation.

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,360
I mean, I'm sure Michele would
have told me if she got one.

120
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,550
- Michele Weinberger?
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,594
- Do you live with Michele Weinberger?
- Yeah.

122
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,475
I just thought maybe she'd
be married to Sandy by now.

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,034
- Sandy Frink?
- Yes, Sandy Frink.

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,276
He could barely contain his erection
every time she was around.

125
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,312
Why do you think he always
carried that huge notebook?

126
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,318
The Frink-a-zoid
and Michele, I am sure.

127
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,228
Besides, didn't you have a thing
for Sandy in high school?

128
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,275
I did not have a "thing." I did not have
a "thing." I did not have a "thing."

129
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,277
I was very much
in love with him.

130
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,630
Very much in love,
and there's a difference.

131
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,038
There's a difference.

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,957
There's a difference.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,116
I have to go now.

134
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,517
Well! I guess I won't be
seeing you at the reunion.

135
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,790
- But I'll tell everyone you said "hi."
- Why don't you tell everyone...

136
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,310
I said to go fuck themselves, for making
my teen years a living hell?

137
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,998
Oh, yeah, right!

138
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,038
Finally--

139
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,758
Michele. You will never guess
who I just ran into.

140
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,475
- God, I cannot believe
it's already been ten years.
- I know.

141
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,989
- Oh.
- You know...
- There she is.

142
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,476
Oh! God,
she was so weird.

143
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,672
- She still is.
- Why was she, like, always
going behind that building?

144
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,275
It was long ago

145
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,109
Seems like yesterday

146
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,915
Saw you standin' in the rain

147
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,715
- Then I heard you say
- Got a light?

148
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,549
- I want your love
But it comes out wrong
- Thank you.

149
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,559
- I want to live, but I don't belong
- Thank you! Thank you,
I really appreciate that...

150
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,831
because I'm not a human being
or anything, you pathetic turd!

151
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,798
Blood and roses
Blood and roses

152
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,230
Blood and roses

153
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,115
- Roses, roses
- There should be a cigarette
you could smoke all the way
through between classes.

154
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,800
What a waste.

155
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,957
- Okay.
- Find us.
- Oh. Okay.

156
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,916
Oh, my God, do you remember
what a big controversy it was...

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,476
for us to have our
picture taken together?

158
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,309
Yeah, well, Danny Weller, like,
"lodged the complaint," and, you know--

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,671
'Cause, "alphabetically,
he's supposed to be between us."

160
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,591
And then we said, "Okay, Danny.
If you want to be between us...

161
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,598
you can come to Michele's house on
Friday night, and we'll be waiting."

162
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,711
That's right. He came over and
we're like, "Danny, it was a joke."

163
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,434
I know! And then we turned
the sprinklers on him!

164
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,149
Oh, my God.
Didn't he die?

165
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,677
- I think so.
- Yeah.

166
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,750
- Oh, my God. Michele.
Look at the "A" group.
- Mm-hmm.

167
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,235
Christie Masters,
Kelly Possenger...

168
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,555
Lisa Luder
and Cheryl Quick.

169
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,272
So, who would you say
was in the "B" group?

170
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,278
Oh. The drama crowd. You know,
like Casey Degan and Mark Black.

171
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,598
- Uh-huh. God, I had the hugest
crush on Casey. 'Member?
- Oh, yeah.

172
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,517
God, I wonder why
he never liked me.

173
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,952
Young man, there's
no need to feel down

174
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,957
I said, young man--

175
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,514
So, what group would
you say we were in?

176
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,074
Well, we definitely
weren't in the "A" group.

177
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,078
But you know what? We weren't
really in the "B" group, either.

178
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,236
Okay, we weren't in
the "C" group, were we?

179
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,035
What? Oh, no. Michele, come on.
I mean, that was like,
all the honour students and like...

180
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,674
the rejects; you know, like
Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.

181
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,031
- Eeew, look at them.
- We were definitely not in that group.

182
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,515
- Ecch.
- She blinded me with Science

183
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,519
Michele! Oh, Michele.
Over here!

184
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,437
Want me to get your
huge notebook for you?

185
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,030
Oh! Heather! I wanna
take another picture of you and
Sandy for the yearbook and--

186
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,037
Oh! I wanna
interview you too...

187
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,628
because I think it would make a really
interesting article for the "Roundup."

188
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,320
Ohh, Toby! Fuck off.

189
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,715
Okay. But can I take
a picture of you first?

190
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,711
So, Romy, what group
were we in?

191
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,753
Well, you know, I'm not sure that
we were really in any group.

192
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,599
I think maybe we were
more like loners.

193
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,838
- Oh, my God! There we are!
- Yeah, and alone. Look.

194
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,157
You know, even though I had
to wear that stupid back brace,
and you were kinda fat...

195
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,077
we were still totally
cutting edge.

196
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,192
- I love it when it's hamburger day.
- Uh-huh.

197
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,552
Okay, smile! Great!
Thanks a lot!

198
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,752
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, please.
- Hello, girls.

199
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,758
Don't forget, you have
detention after school today.

200
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,759
- Oh, we won't, Mr Lish.
- Yeah, we're really
looking forward to it.

201
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,272
- God!
- Can you believe he just got married?

202
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,269
- Like, how desperate is she?
- I know, it's like:
"Hi. This is my husband.

203
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,631
He dissects crayfish, but he
has a really good personality."

204
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,992
He's the kind of man
that I desire

205
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,432
Sets the summer sun
on fire

206
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,439
- I want candy
- Oh, my God.

207
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,190
- I want candy
- Michele. Billy Christianson.

208
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,630
- Oh, he's so cute.
- He is cute.
- Really cute.

209
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,918
- Hey
- Hi, Billy.
- Hey

210
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,951
Hey

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,957
Hey

212
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,355
- Hey
- Ow! Billy!

213
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,109
Oh, Billy, gosh,
you're so slimy.

214
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,596
I cannot believe he's
with Christie Masters.

215
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,518
I know. She is, like,
so transparent.

216
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,551
Did you hear her report
in Miss Weigatt's class?

217
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,673
She actually thinks she's gonna be a
TV anchorwoman. What a "deludanoid."

218
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,034
Those weirdos are
staring at us again.

219
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,993
- They're obsessed with us.
- Look at what they're wearing.

220
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,554
Where do you even get
outfits that hideous?

221
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,478
They made them in Home Ec
from their own patterns.

222
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,034
Actually, I think
they're semi-interesting.

223
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,033
In a freakish, off-putting
sort of way. Never mind.

224
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,957
- Christie.
- Uh.
- Come on, I'm hungry.

225
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,799
No, Billy. Wait.
I wanna have some fun.

226
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,718
Lisa, gimme the bag.

227
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,553
Here you go.
You are so bad.

228
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,352
- What? What?
- She is out of control.

229
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,356
Michele? Christie Masters
is coming over here.

230
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,189
- Wow. She never comes over.
- Okay, just act cool.

231
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,391
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Christie.

232
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,150
- So. You girls gonna try out
for the spring musical?
- Us?

233
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,592
Yeah, you should.
It'll be fun.

234
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,518
- Okay. Why not?
- Yeah. So, um, what
musical are they doing?

235
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,552
- "The Music Man."
- You're kidding!

236
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,070
Oh, the Wells Fargo wagon
ls a-comin' down the street

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,919
I love "The Music Man."

238
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,591
Okay. Can I have
the rest of this?

239
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,110
Um, w--

240
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,993
Mm. It's good.

241
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,911
See ya!

242
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,191
She can be really nice
when she wants to be.

243
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,077
Michele!

244
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,711
- Uh-oh. Don't look now.
Here come the Frink-a-zoid.
- Oh, God! He is such a geek!

245
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,879
Hi, Michele. Gee, Michele,
you're looking really lovely today.

246
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay. See you in Biology.

247
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,117
I-l-l thought I ought
to tell you, Michele, that...

248
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,552
Christie Masters stuck
magnets on your back.

249
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,511
- What?
- She stuck--

250
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,631
Michele, you do have
magnets on your back!

251
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,672
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

252
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,075
Oh, my God.
Help me.

253
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,997
Oh, my God.

254
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,074
Oh, don't let them see you get upset.
That's what they want.

255
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,435
Oh, my God.

256
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,279
- Hey!
- I'm pretending you just
did something hilarious.

257
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,550
Now, you laugh at me.
Come on, do it.

258
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,593
God, that was so rude. I mean, you
couldn't help it if you had scoliosis.

259
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,748
I know. And what a bitch, taking
your hamburger. I mean, what was that?

260
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,559
God, remember the prom?
You got so thin by then.

261
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,998
Oh, I know. I was so lucky,
getting mono. That was, like,
the best diet ever.

262
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,795
I wonder, if I had gotten
my brace off sooner, if
somebody would have invited me.

263
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,036
I mean, other
than Sandy Frink.

264
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,230
Well, nobody
invited me either.

265
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,480
Well, at least we looked fantastic,
and that is the most important thing.

266
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,116
- We were cool on craze
- Oh, gee. Nice outfits. Really.

267
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,233
- When l, you
- Oh, look, it's the Madonna twins.
- And everyone we knew

268
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,150
Could believe, do, and share
in what was true, Oh, I said

269
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,840
Okay, this is so typical.
Of course, we're like the only ones...

270
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,996
who don't look like
we're going to a hoedown.

271
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,157
-Oh, I know. This town is like so unhip.
-Ecch.

272
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,716
- I can't wait till we move to L.A.
- Me too!

273
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,310
Everything's gonna happen for us there,
Michele, and we'll never look back.

274
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,113
- Okay.
- Dance hall days

275
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,239
- Dance hall days
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

276
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,430
That hurt.
But it looked really good.

277
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,437
Dance hall days

278
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,357
Oh, everybody!

279
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,755
- Dance hall, dance hall days
- Okay, everyone.

280
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,475
Uh, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

281
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,115
It's time to announce
the king and queen of the prom.

282
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,198
- Ahh!
- And the winners are...

283
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,717
Billy Christianson
and Christie Masters!

284
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,071
Ohh! Ohh!

285
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,510
- Duh.
- Oh, it's me!

286
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,710
Boo-hoo!
I'm so surprised!

287
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,035
Thank you. Thank you.

288
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,469
God, Billy looks
cute in his tux.

289
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,989
- He does look cute.
- Really cute.

290
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,193
Do you think, since it's
the last night of school and
I might never see him again...

291
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,437
that maybe he would
dance with me?

292
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,154
I bet he would.
I mean, it's senior prom.

293
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,555
Nobody's going to say "no"
to anyone tonight.

294
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,470
Michele, since this is the
last night of school and all...

295
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,478
would you care
to dance with me once?

296
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,670
No.

297
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,196
I'll dance with you.

298
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,518
Nah. It's no fun unless
you really love the person.

299
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,593
Thanks, anyway.

300
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,234
Okay. Who can name the capitals
of all the 50 states?

301
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,238
Okay, Toby. Fuck off.

302
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,478
Heather! Can't you be
a little bit more sensitive?

303
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,388
Me? Me? Me be
more sensitive?

304
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,317
You are a jerk-off!

305
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,353
Another kiss
is what it takes

306
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,391
- Albuquerque.
- You can't sleep

307
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,317
- You can't eat
- Albany.

308
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,396
There's no doubt

309
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,431
You're in deep

310
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,519
Your throat is tight
You can't breathe

311
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,952
Another kiss is all you need
Whoa-oh-ohh

312
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,231
- Why are you tormenting me?
- You like to think
you're immune to the stuff

313
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,354
- Why don't you go fuck a sheep
or your sister or yourself?
- Oh, yeah

314
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,869
Brain-dead
redneck asshole!

315
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,117
Can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it

316
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,074
You're addicted to love
You see the signs

317
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,316
But you can't read

318
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,353
You're runnin' at
a different speed

319
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,519
Your heart beats
in double time

320
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,756
- Another kiss
- Um, Billy?

321
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,677
- And you'll be mine
- Hi.

322
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,952
- A one-track mind, you can't be saved
- Do you wanna dance?

323
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,277
- Oblivion is all you crave
- I mean, it's just 'cause...

324
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,119
this song is,
like, so great.

325
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,708
Mm. Never mind.

326
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,912
Unless, you know,
you want to.

327
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,349
- Whoa, you like to think
- Yeah. I mean--

328
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,391
- That you're immune to this stuff
- Y-Y-- Sure. Why not?

329
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,718
- Oh, yeah
- Really?
- Wh-- Um--

330
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,637
- It's closer to the truth
- Could you wait here?

331
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,320
- To say you can't get enough
- I-l-l'll be right back.
- Okay.

332
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,149
- Okay.
- You know, you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love

333
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,068
Might as well face it
You're addicted to love

334
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,997
- Might as well face it
- Hey, Christie.

335
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,476
- You're addicted to love
- That Romy girl just asked
me to dance with her.

336
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,910
- Might as well face it
- Oh, you're kidding me!
Oh, that's pathetic!

337
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,158
- Might as well face it
- W-W-W-What should I do?

338
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,271
Let me take care of this.

339
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,877
- Michele?
- Oh, God. Okay, so what did he say?

340
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,833
- "Sure. Why not?"
- Oh, my God!

341
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,758
- Thanks a lot, Romy.
- What?

342
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,836
Thanks for stealing
my boyfriend.

343
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,157
- What are you talking about?
- Billy just broke up with me.

344
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
Apparently he's had a crush on
you since Mr Roswell's class.

345
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,272
And now that he knows that
you like him, he doesn't want
to "pretend" with me any more.

346
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,836
My life was perfect
and you've ruined it.

347
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,679
Go for it
Groove ahead

348
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,598
I swear to God, Christie,
I didn't even think he'd dance with me.

349
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,395
- To whip it, Whip it good
- Wow. She is really P.O.'d.

350
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,990
- This is so cool!
- Oh, I know.

351
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,999
You know what is so weird?
I had this dream, where Billy
was like, in love with me.

352
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,795
And I mean, he was in
a wheelchair, but still, it's like
it's coming true or something!

353
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,115
- Uh-huh.
- How's my hair?

354
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,073
Perfect. Okay, Romy, you look so
good with blonde hair and black roots.

355
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,237
- It's like, not even funny.
- I have to say...

356
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,069
this is turning out to be one of
the very best nights of my entire life.

357
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,236
Yay, yay!

358
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,392
Lyin' in my bed I hear
the clock tick

359
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,829
And think of you

360
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,793
Caught up in circles

361
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,833
Confusion is nothing new

362
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,555
Flashback to warm nights

363
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,911
Almost left behind

364
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,749
- Suitcase of memories
- You know, maybe he's, like,
passed out in the bathroom.

365
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,677
- You want me to go check?
- Time after, Sometimes

366
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,837
- You picture me
- He's not in the bathroom, Michele.

367
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,191
I'm walkin' too far ahead

368
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,198
- I'll dance with you, Romy.
- You're callin' to me

369
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,154
- I can't hear what you've said
- Okay.
- Okay.

370
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,193
Then you say "Go slow"

371
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,551
I fall behind

372
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,319
The second hand unwinds

373
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,911
If you're lost you can look
and you will find me

374
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,349
Time after time

375
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,871
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

376
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,275
Time after time

377
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,951
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

378
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,469
Time after time

379
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,037
- If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting
- I will be waiting

380
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,516
Time after time

381
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,437
Time after time

382
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,630
We just waited and waited.

383
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,639
- God, I was such an idiot.
- But wait till he sees you now.

384
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,433
You are so much cuter
than you were in high school.

385
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,233
- I guess I'm cuter.
- Yeah!

386
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,591
And look at the way we live.
I mean, just our lifestyle.

387
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,837
You know, I mean, we live in L.A,
and they are still stuck in Tucson.

388
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,834
You know what, Michele?
You're right.

389
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,758
We are gonna go back there
and blow them away.

390
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,956
Boy, there's a lot
of questions to answer.
Why do we have to fill these out?

391
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,548
They wanna know what we've been
doing for the past ten years.

392
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,878
- Oh!
- Okay. Here we go.

393
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,877
- Ahh!
- "Name."

394
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,310
- Ah! We're having so much fun already.
- Oh, I know!

395
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,512
- I cannot wait for this reunion.
- Me too!

396
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,789
"Occupation."
Cashier.

397
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,117
- Unemployed.
- No. Don't write that.

398
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,913
Um, okay, so your last job
was as a salesgirl?

399
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,431
- So say you're a freelance
fashion consultant.
- Ooh! Clever.

400
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,552
"Relationship Status."
Married.

401
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,036
- Nope.
- Engaged?
- No.

402
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,789
- Living with someone?
- Should I say you?

403
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,876
- I guess so.
- Okay.

404
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,398
- You know, Michele?
- Yeah?

405
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,478
- Now that I'm looking at this...
- Uh-huh?

406
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,637
our lives don't seem as
impressive as I thought.

407
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,955
- They don't?
- Well, do you think it's impressive...

408
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,231
that we're still single, and we've
been living together for ten years...

409
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,352
and I'm a cashier
and you're unemployed?

410
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,630
Well, not super impressive.

411
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,991
Well, then, what's the point of going
if we're not going to impress people?

412
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,908
Well-- Uh.

413
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,715
Romy, I still really,
really, really want to go.

414
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,278
- I know. Me too.
- Well then, can't we just,
like, think of something?

415
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,838
- Okay. Well, the reunion is still
like two weeks away, right?
- Right.

416
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,192
And all we really need is maybe some,
like, better jobs and boyfriends. Right?

417
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,629
Yeah!

418
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,072
But, okay. If those things were so easy
to get, wouldn't we already have them?

419
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,031
Well, I mean, we never
really tried before.

420
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,709
I mean, we never really had
a good enough reason, like going
to a reunion, to motivate us.

421
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,671
That's true.

422
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,157
Okay. So we're just gonna have to make
ourselves more impressive, that's all.

423
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,955
So I'm gonna go out and bag us
some boyfriends, while you can
look for a cool new job.

424
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,389
- Okay.
- Plus, I hate to say it...

425
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,397
but I really think that
we should lose some weight.

426
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,317
Oh.

427
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,834
Oh. Unh.

428
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,396
Okay. I don't think that, like,
one chip makes a difference.

429
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,590
It wasn't even
a whole chip.

430
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,749
All right. According to this chart,
if we want to lose a pound a day...

431
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,235
we have to burn twice
as many calories as we eat.

432
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,353
So, that means, if we want
to burn 4,000 calories...

433
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,676
we only have to run
20 miles a day!

434
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,997
Oh! Hey, Romy, remember
Mrs Chivas' class?

435
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,076
There was, like,
always a word problem.

436
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,350
Like, there's a guy in
a rowboat going "X" miles...

437
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,790
and the current is going, like,
you know, some... other miles...

438
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,514
and, how long does it take him
to get to town?

439
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,111
It was like, who cares? Who wants to go
to town with a guy who drives a rowboat?

440
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,800
Okay, guys, let's jump.

441
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,869
- Hey, Michele?
- Yeah?
- What does this remind you of?

442
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,594
Well, I know.
This lady is totally sick.

443
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,596
Uh, lemme just
say that, um...

444
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,996
I am, like, really familiar
with the entire Versace line,
and if you would just...

445
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,319
give me a chance, I know I could,
like, sell the shit out of the stuff.

446
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,638
And, uh, to me,
fashion is just, it's like...

447
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,354
everything. It's--

448
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,756
By the way, that blouse-- Hi.
That blouse looks great on you.

449
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,634
- Oh! Thank you!
- And see, I make a great salesperson...

450
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,796
'cause I just have this,
like, really believable way...

451
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,993
of telling people that they
look really good, even though
I'm just, like, you know--

452
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,032
I think
she heard me.

453
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,152
Thank you so much
for coming.

454
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,512
- That's okay, you're welcome.
- I don't think we'll be
requiring any new staff.

455
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,552
- You aren't taking on any what?
- Staff. Employees.

456
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,796
Ohh! Oh, "staff."

457
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,559
Okay, I didn't understand
with your big accent.

458
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,592
I couldn't
figure it out. Okay.

459
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,549
Fine. You know, you really shouldn't
let people fill out applications...

460
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,992
if you don't want them to
actually try to get a job here.

461
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,875
- It's a compli--
- No, no. That's all I have to say.
- Goodbye.

462
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,878
If there ain't no love
then there ain't no use

463
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,356
Ooh, better walk on by
Better walk on through

464
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,190
Hi. Hey, um, great suit.
Is that an Armani?

465
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,757
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- I thought so. So, what do you do?

466
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,838
- I'm a suit salesman.
- Oh, uh-oh

467
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,590
Would you excuse me?
I cut my foot before,
and my shoe is filling up with blood.

468
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,998
Ooh, if there ain't no love
then there ain't no use

469
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,669
Ooh, better walk on by
Better walk on through

470
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,315
Hey, hey, there's a woman in the world
that you can't use

471
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,552
Ain't no love, Ain't no use
Ain't no love

472
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,038
Yeah, well, my first choice was
to work at a boutique on Rodeo Drive,
but this would be okay.

473
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,233
Well, thank you. Unfortunately, we
don't have any openings here right now.

474
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,157
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

475
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,512
Although we might have
an opening at our discount outlet.

476
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,632
Okay, well, what street
would that be on?

477
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,632
Come on, Michele. At this point,
any job is better than no job at all.

478
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,354
A discount outlet? Me?

479
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,350
Fine.

480
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,948
So, any boyfriends yet?

481
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,313
No. All the guys with good jobs
must be going to some other club.

482
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,149
Oh, you know where Dana met her new
boyfriend? He's a William Morris agent.

483
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,909
Oh! Showbiz!
Good job! Where?

484
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,671
Hi. My name is Romy,
and I'm an alcoholic.

485
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,588
- Hi, Romy!
- Hey.

486
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,156
And you also get a five-percent
employee discount...

487
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,748
over and above our
everyday low prices.

488
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,475
You could make curtains
for the motorhome with this.

489
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,639
- I got this tie for a dollar.
- You paid a whole dollar for that?

490
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,433
- You betcha.
- Ah!

491
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,148
She's one
of our regulars.

492
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,959
So, what do you think?

493
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,799
I-l'd like to go away.

494
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,950
I know I'm supposed to wait
in that line, but listen.

495
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,868
I wouldn't even be here if this
weren't, like, a dating emergency.

496
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,152
Our cutoff is 25.
Try VH-1.

497
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,710
The reunion's less than a week
away. I mean, I just can't
believe you turned down a job.

498
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,274
Well, I thought the idea
was to impress people.

499
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,871
I mean, how am I going
to impress anyone by selling
Ban-Lon smocks at Bargain Mart?

500
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,319
I'm sick of this.
I'm gonna go weigh myself.

501
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,192
Oh, God! I've been killing myself
for eight days and I gained a pound.

502
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,632
That's impossible! Did you
deduct 16 pounds for your shoes?

503
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,877
Just forget it.
I'm not going.

504
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,709
- What?
- Come on. Get real, Michele.
We're idiots.

505
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,789
We can't get jobs and boyfriends,
and lose weight, in two weeks.

506
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,388
But I thought
you said we could.

507
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,192
Wow. God, the top female
executives are all so pretty.

508
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,869
Those aren't the actual executives,
Michele. Those are models.

509
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,560
Oh, I thought
they looked familiar.

510
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,831
God, they really look like
executives, don't they?

511
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,916
That's only because they're
wearing those stupid suits...

512
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,838
and phoney glasses,
and carrying briefcases.

513
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,193
- Huh!
- Oh, my God, Michele, that's it!

514
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,232
We can go to the reunion, and
just pretend to be successful!

515
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,510
I mean, who's gonna know?
They're in Tucson, we're here.

516
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,995
We could just show up
looking like businesswomen.

517
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,237
Oh, my God!
Oh!

518
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,239
Wait. Ohh. But if the people at the
reunion see us drive up in a Nova...

519
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,033
won't they know we're not
really businesswomen?

520
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,674
If you can make us
the clothes...

521
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,633
I can get us the car.

522
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,959
Clear out, boys.
I need to talk to Ramon.

523
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,877
Go!

524
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,679
Yes, cara mia?

525
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,110
Michele and I have this
high school reunion to go to...

526
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,879
and we need to show up
in a really cool car.

527
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,912
- Yeah?
- Todd told me that he gave
you a really great deal...

528
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,398
- on an XJS convertible and
that you're fixing it up.
- Yeah?

529
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,956
So...

530
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,640
can I borrow your car?

531
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,320
Well, if I loan
you my car...

532
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,079
what do I get?

533
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,909
- Uh, what do you want?
- Ohh, Romy...

534
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,996
you know what I want.

535
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,999
Oh, forget it. I'm not going
to have sex with you
just to borrow your stupid car!

536
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,190
I gotta get something.

537
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,876
Okay.

538
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,279
Close the blinds,
and we'll work something out.

539
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,755
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh, Ramon!

540
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,872
- Ohh, Ramon, ohh! Ohh!
- Check this out.

541
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,753
- Oh, yes. Ohh.
- Oh, yeah.

542
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,075
- Oh, man!
- Ohh! Ohh!

543
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,873
Ohh, Ramon!
Ohh, Ramon!

544
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,673
Ohh! Oh, yes.

545
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,836
You are Columbus,
and I am America.

546
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,350
Discover me, Ramon!
Just discover me.

547
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,995
Hey, uh-- Explosions.
The earth is moving.

548
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,591
Explosions!
The earth is moving!

549
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,952
Ah, ooh-- is that an earthquake?
No, it's Ramon.

550
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,949
Is that an earthquake?
No, it's Ramon!

551
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,230
Ahh! It's Ramon!

552
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,353
Man stallion, fill me
with your giant love wand!

553
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,471
What? No, I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

554
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,831
Well, say something nice
about my penis!

555
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,191
Oh, Ramon, your penis
is so powerful. I'm coming!

556
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,995
- Okay, thanks. Get off me now.
- Aw, come on, wh--

557
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,554
- You wanted it to be believable.
- Aww.

558
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,468
I'm just a girl
in the world

559
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,037
That's all that
you'll let me be

560
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,597
Oh, I'm just a girl
living in captivity

561
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,836
Oh, my God!
You did it!

562
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,556
Yeah, I did.
All right, let's get going.

563
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,036
Oh, this is gonna
be so much fun.

564
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,390
- So, what'd you have to do to get it?
- I had to give all the guys...

565
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,398
in the service department
hand jobs.

566
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,432
Well, while you were doing that,
I taped all the nostalgic songs...

567
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,870
from high school,
to get us in the mood.

568
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,673
- Michele?
- Huh?
- I was kidding.

569
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,839
- What?
- You actually think I would
do something like that?

570
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,350
For a car?

571
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,119
- Okay, just get in.
- Okay.

572
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,392
Hey, look what else
I got us, little lady.

573
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,114
- Oh, my God. It's a flip phone!
- Uh-huh.

574
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,196
- How'd you get this?
- I bought it.

575
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,796
Okay.

576
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,717
- Are ya ready?
- Ready.

577
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,274
Let's do it.

578
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,197
Tonight
I gotta cut loose

579
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,117
- Footloose
- Footloose!
- Footloose!

580
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,595
- Kick off my Sunday shoes
- Kick off my Sunday knees?

581
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,349
- Oowhee, Louise
- I have no idea what
the rest of the lyrics are.

582
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,313
- Me neither. Whoo!
- Jack, get back

583
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,352
- Watch out, Tucson, here we come!
- Come on before we crack

584
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,435
- Shit!
- Aww.

585
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,557
- Loose your blues
- Watch out, Tucson, here we come!
- Everybody cut footloose

586
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,229
Footloose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes

587
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,237
- Shit!
- Aww.

588
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,912
- Footloose
- Whoo!

589
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,439
- You're playin' so cool
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

590
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,915
Obeyin' every rule

591
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,554
- Dig way down in your heart
- Down in your art--

592
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,875
- You're yearnin', burnin'
- You're flurnin', burnin', earnin'

593
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,912
- Somebody to tell you
- Somebody better tell you

594
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,271
- That life ain't passin' you by
- You have one hell of an eye

595
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,479
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

596
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,068
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

597
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,156
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

598
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,635
- Everybody, everybody cut footloose
- Footloose

599
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,109
I got your picture
I got your picture

600
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,595
I'd like a million of ya
all to myself

601
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,154
I want a doctor
to take a picture

602
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,714
So I can look at you
from inside as well

603
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,549
- You got me turning up and turning down
- Okay, I give up. What are you doing?

604
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,910
Pass this car.
This kid is so obnoxious.

605
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,474
- Turning Japanese
- Oh, my God. What is with that kid?

606
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,955
I don't know.
He is sick!

607
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,279
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

608
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,030
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

609
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,754
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

610
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,269
Oh, I'm sorry. No.

611
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,358
No, not you. No. I was trying
to scare your little boy.

612
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,350
Oh, my God.
Are my lips that big?

613
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,713
Woke up this mornin'
happy as can be

614
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,956
- Some more of that?
- Yeah.

615
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,469
All right. Now, just remember,
from this point on...

616
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,229
we are sophisticated, educated,
successful career women.

617
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,989
Right. Okay.

618
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,749
God, this underwear is totally
riding up my butt crack.

619
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,955
Yeah. Hello.
Um, we need something to go.

620
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,790
- Okay.
- Do you have some sort of
businesswoman's special?

621
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,430
- Come again?
- Well, we're businesswomen.

622
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,997
- Yeah. From L.A.
- And you know some places have,
like, a lunch special.

623
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,839
For businesswomen.

624
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,077
We don't have
anything like that.

625
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,670
Well, then why don't you
just give us, um, two burgers
and fries and Diet Cokes...

626
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,076
- 'cause we're in a hurry.
- Mm. We're due in Tucson later.

627
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,988
For a business thing.
You know.

628
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,031
What kind
of business you in?

629
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,838
I can't believe we never thought
of what to say we did for a living.

630
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,520
Oh. Which one
of these guys...

631
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,279
will I have sex with
at the reunion?

632
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,556
Ooh!
Casey Degan!

633
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,638
- Aaah!
- Come on! Now, we're
running out of time.

634
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,949
I know. Why don't we say
that we own our own company?

635
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,389
Ooh, good.
Like what?

636
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,115
- Like, what if we invented something?
- Like what?

637
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,392
Well, okay, l-l think it should
be like something that-that
everybody has heard about...

638
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,478
but-but nobody really
knows who invented it.

639
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,670
Oh, my God! I've got it!
Post-lts!

640
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,917
- Everybody knows what Post-lts are!
- Yeah!

641
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,112
They're the little yellow things
with the stickum on the back, right?

642
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,151
Okay.

643
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,033
Okay, we're-we're working in this
advertising agency after college.

644
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,151
- Ooh, college! Good one!
- Yeah.

645
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,352
And we have, like, this big,
like, presentation...

646
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,277
to make to,
like, a client.

647
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,073
- Hmm!
- So-so-so we're, like, brainstorming...

648
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,714
and all of the sudden
we're out of paper clips!

649
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,071
- Good!
- And so, okay-- So then l, l, like--

650
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,316
Okay, I say--
I say-- Okay--

651
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,591
"Wouldn't it be great if there
was, like, this, like, stickum
on the back of this paper...

652
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,554
"so, like, it-it would just--
if I laid it on top of that
other paper it would just stay...

653
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,477
you know, like,
without a paper clip?"

654
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,158
- Yes!
- Ahh!

655
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,396
So then you've got, like, this
grandfather or this uncle...

656
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,034
that, like, has, like, a-- Iike a--
Iike a paper company or a paper mill...

657
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,038
and-and he's, like, really into it,
and the rest is history!

658
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,435
Oh, my God!
It is perfect!

659
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,518
Wow!
Don't you think?

660
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,359
Well, yeah, but--

661
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,358
- "Well, yeah, but" what?
- I don't know.

662
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,472
I mean, it just sounds like you invented
Post-lts all by yourself, you know.

663
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,956
-I mean, what did I do?
-Well, it was your grandfather or uncle.

664
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,839
Yeah?

665
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,713
Okay, you know,
so we could say that...

666
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,637
you were,
like, the designer.

667
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,832
Like, I thought of them, but you
thought of making them yellow.

668
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,320
Well, no, but it's like
most of these people...

669
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,715
have, like, known us
since elementary school.

670
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,593
I just think that you're
more believable as a designer...

671
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,235
rather than
as an inventor, you know?

672
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,999
- Uh-huh.
- You're my lover

673
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,317
Not my rival

674
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,237
- What are you doing?
- Look.

675
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,112
You're obviously
pissed at me.

676
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,037
No. Uh-uh. Why should
I be pissed at you?

677
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,151
Just because now I know
how you really feel about me.

678
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,032
Oh, my God,
I knew this would happen.

679
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,232
I mean, I try, for once,
to be honest with you...

680
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,157
and it blows up
in my face.

681
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,954
God!
You wanna be honest?

682
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,833
Okay, good!
Let's be honest!

683
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,957
I let you
have the ideas!

684
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,036
- What?
- Yeah, I let you have the ideas...

685
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,549
so you won't feel so bad
that I'm cuter.

686
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,275
- You are not cuter, Michele.
- I am so cuter.

687
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,789
It's, like, common knowledge, Romy.
Everybody thinks so.

688
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,354
I'm the Mary
and you're the Rhoda.

689
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,835
That's ridiculous. You're the Rhoda.
You're the Jewish one.

690
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,713
Oh, my God. I'm talking
cuteness-wise, Romy, okay?

691
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,910
And cuteness-wise,
I'm the Mary.

692
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,238
That's crazy! You have absolutely
no proof that you're cuter!

693
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,749
Oh, proof? You want proof?
Okay, fine.

694
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,314
- Who lost their virginity first?
- Oh, big wow!

695
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,398
With your cousin Barry.
I wouldn't brag about it.

696
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,877
Okay, so who always gets asked to
dance first when we go to clubs, huh?

697
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,309
No wonder you couldn't
find us boyfriends, Romy.

698
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,548
Well, so what?
You can't even get a job!

699
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,468
- I carry you, Michele!
Without me, you'd be lost!
- That is such a lie!

700
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,353
Oh, yeah? Well, let's just see.
Let's split up and see what happens.

701
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,471
W-What do you mean,
split up?

702
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,275
When we get to Tucson,
we're going our own separate ways.

703
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,231
Okay. Good.

704
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,157
Fine.
I don't care.

705
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,918
- Fine!
- Fine.

706
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,110
As of Tucson,
we're finished.

707
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,276
Well, drive fast!

708
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,353
Always something there
to remind me

709
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,833
Wow.
Billy Christianson?

710
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,150
Romy. Romy White.

711
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,590
No. No way.

712
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,870
My God, you--
you look fantastic.

713
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,675
I mean, l-- I never would have
recognized you in a million years.

714
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,030
Thanks.

715
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,630
So, what have you been doin'
since high school?

716
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,991
Well,
believe it or not...

717
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,236
I invented Post-lts.

718
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,439
So I told Prescott...

719
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,870
"You can either pay me the 150
or I am out of here. Bye-bye."

720
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,039
I mean, there are at least 12
other major markets that would
put me on the air tomorrow.

721
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,038
Wow. So you did it?
You're an anchorwoman?

722
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,755
No.
I'm a weather girl.

723
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,189
On the highest-rated
5:00 news in Tucson.

724
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,072
- Oh.
- So...

725
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,749
Michele,
what are you up to?

726
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,270
Uh, okay.
Um, I invented Post-lts.

727
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,994
- You're kidding!
- You must've made a fortune!

728
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,076
Well, yeah.

729
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,997
No offence, Michele...

730
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,078
but how in the world
did you think of Post-lts?

731
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,957
Um... well...

732
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,877
uh...

733
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,434
And I invented them
totally by myself.

734
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,348
I mean, all Michele did was say,
"What about making them yellow?"

735
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,237
Really?

736
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,310
- Actually, I invented
a special kind of glue.
- Oh, really?

737
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,034
Well, then I'm sure you wouldn't
mind giving us a detailed account...

738
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,199
of exactly how you concocted
this miracle glue, would you?

739
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,197
No. Um--

740
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,039
Well, ordinarily
when you make glue...

741
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,357
first you need to
thermoset your resin...

742
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,553
and then after it cools
you mix in a, um, epoxide.

743
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,875
Which is really just
a fancy-schmancy name...

744
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,151
for any simple,
oxygenated adhesive, right?

745
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,193
But then I thought maybe-- just maybe--
you could raise the viscosity...

746
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,199
by adding a complex glucose derivative
during the emulsification process.

747
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,198
And it turns out,
I was right.

748
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,195
Huh?
I don't believe it.

749
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,676
You must be the most successful
person in our graduating class.

750
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,598
Uh-huh.
And you're not. Bye.

751
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,951
Always something there
to remind me

752
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,997
This is so great.

753
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,477
Romy?

754
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,157
Can I ask you
something?

755
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,713
Romy! You will not believe
what just happened!

756
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,149
Michele, can't you see
that I am busy?

757
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,556
Fine.
Okay, just forget it.

758
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,714
Whoa! Oh. Oww.

759
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,115
Oww. Oww. Oww.

760
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,639
Oh!

761
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,228
Oh! Come on!

762
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,119
Oh, God!
Are you all right?

763
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,754
- What do you think?
- I am so sorry.

764
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,633
My-My-My driver
didn't see you.

765
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,752
Please. Come.

766
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,429
I have boxes of Kleenex
in my limo.

767
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,357
Let me make it up
to you.

768
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,639
Okay.

769
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,993
Oh, my God.

770
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,476
- Here. Help yourself, Michele.
- Thanks.

771
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,716
Wait. How do you
know my name?

772
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,912
It's me, Michele.
Sandy.

773
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,759
- Sandy Frink?
- Uh-huh.

774
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,189
But you're so dreamy.

775
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,117
Well, when I made
my first million...

776
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,198
my present to myself
was a new face.

777
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,117
Okay, I'm not
just saying this...

778
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,356
but you really picked
a good one.

779
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,391
Thanks.

780
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,916
I had this notebook...

781
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,033
with "Mrs Romy Christianson" written
on it, like, about a thousand times.

782
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,833
Now you think
I'm some sort of geek.

783
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,755
No. No.

784
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,872
No, not at all.

785
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,436
I'm flattered.

786
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,555
Hi, Billy.

787
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,069
I've been lookin'
all over for you.

788
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,677
You wanna dance once?

789
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,553
You know,
for old times' sake.

790
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,950
No, thanks.

791
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,314
I owe this one to Romy.

792
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,192
Hey, you guys, they're about
to announce the winners of the vote.

793
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,278
- Come on!
- Vote? What vote?

794
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,075
- Let's go. We gotta get in there.
- Okay.

795
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,075
Wait, I can't
find my top.

796
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,549
Where are you?

797
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,997
Hey, how you guys
doin' tonight?

798
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,193
I bet, uh, everyone
is as anxious...

799
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,709
as I am to hear
the results of the vote.

800
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,558
What vote?

801
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,276
The person voted Most Changed
for the Better Since High School is--

802
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,549
It's a tie.
It's a tie.

803
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,797
The Most Changed for the Better
Since High School are...

804
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,913
Romy White
and Michele Weinberger.

805
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,238
Honey, go on up there
and get your medal.

806
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,157
Okay.

807
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,511
How weird. I didn't
even know we were voting.

808
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,276
Get me another daiquiri.

809
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,477
Here you go.

810
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,033
Um, I'm sorry.
I couldn't find my top.

811
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,431
Honey,
that is beautiful.

812
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,036
May I take that
for you, sir?

813
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,835
No, no, no.
You leave me alone.

814
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,436
Looking at your medal
from the reunion again, dear?

815
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,353
You miss her,
don't you?

816
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,237
Duh.

817
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,837
Michele...

818
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,269
have you been terribly unhappy
with me all these years?

819
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,595
Oh, no.
No, Sandy.

820
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,472
Oh, good.

821
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,036
I've just been lonely
with no one to talk to.

822
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,955
Why don't you call her?

823
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,077
- Okay.
- Yeah.

824
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,477
- Hello?
- Billy Christianson?

825
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,717
Oh, no, no,
I'm-l'm Billy Junior.

826
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,992
Oh, Billy, honey,
is your mommy home?

827
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,838
Well, yeah.

828
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,396
Yeah, but, uh, she can't come
to the phone right now.

829
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,317
She-She's on
her deathbed.

830
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,590
- Romy.
- Oh, dear.

831
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,676
Billy, honey...

832
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,476
tell your mommy that
Michele Weinberger-Frink...

833
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,397
is on the phone...

834
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,479
and would very much
like to speak with her.

835
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,875
No.

836
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,911
Not until you admit...

837
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,316
that I'm the Mary,
and you're the Rhoda.

838
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,840
I'm the Mary.

839
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,757
I'm the Mary!

840
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,829
I'm the-- You're a pasty hag
on a deathbed.

841
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,833
I'm the Mary.
Everybody knows.

842
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,190
Way to go, honey.

843
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,995
Oh, God.

844
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,917
Oh, we're really here.

845
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,350
- Oh, God.
- Good evening, sir.

846
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,471
Thanks for not
waking me up, Romy.

847
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,875
God, what a bitch.

848
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,753
Don't get me wrong

849
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,075
If I'm looking
kind of dazzled

850
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,831
I see neon lights

851
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,673
Whenever you walk by

852
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,515
Don't get me wrong

853
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,792
- Hey, Romy White.
- Hey.

854
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,708
- Where's Michele?
- I don't know.

855
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,070
Um, anybody see
Billy Christianson?

856
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,839
- Try the bar.
- Thanks, man.

857
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,870
Don't get me wrong

858
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,549
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
You-you can't go in without a name tag.

859
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,511
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

860
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,517
Uh, Michele Weinberger.

861
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,031
Oh, my God, Michele Weinberger!
My God, you look great!

862
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,436
It's me, Toby.
Oh, Toby Walters.

863
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,835
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

864
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,030
Um, oh, here it is.
Here is your name tag.

865
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,310
And, um, Romy
is already inside.

866
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,955
- I could care less.
I am not here with Romy.
- You're kidding me.

867
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,230
No, we're not
even friends any more.

868
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,272
We had this big falling out
over Post-lts.

869
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,351
- Post-lts?
- It's a long story.

870
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,277
- See ya.
- W-W--

871
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,233
I'm only off to wander

872
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,033
Across a moonlit night

873
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,269
Once in a while

874
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,356
Two people meet

875
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,359
Seemingly, for no reason
they just pass on the street

876
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,315
Suddenly thundershowers
everywhere

877
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,396
Who can explain
the thunder and rain

878
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,511
But there's somethin'
in the air

879
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,915
Ooh, excuse me.

880
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,871
Hi, Romy.
How are you?

881
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,037
- Lisa Luder?
- Yes.

882
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,914
So, where's the rest
of the "A" group?

883
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,315
Oh, they're around here
someplace.

884
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,476
We sort of lost touch
over the years.

885
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,479
Wow. Isn't it weird when you're
not friends with your friends any more?

886
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,196
I mean, Michele and I just fell
out of touch about two hours ago.

887
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,117
Because she's selfish...

888
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,435
and she always,
like, devalues me.

889
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,357
And I'm sick of it,
you know?

890
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,794
God, you guys are easy
to talk to.

891
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,717
I invented Post-lts.

892
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,635
- You know, the yellow things
with the stickum on the back?
- Yes, I know what they are.

893
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,399
So, uh,
what are you up to?

894
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,399
I'm an associate fashion editor
for Vogue.

895
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,671
Wow! Wh--
Good job!

896
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,917
Boy, I must have, like,
every single issue of Vogue...

897
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,032
for the past ten years.

898
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,197
Okay, well, it was
very nice talking with you.

899
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,390
Nice talking to you too.

900
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,713
Okay, Romy.

901
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,559
It might just be
fantastic

902
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,429
Don't get me wrong

903
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,677
It was so cute.

904
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,075
My mom gave us
a new car seat for the baby.

905
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,078
And when the box arrived, little
Jake looks up at me and says...

906
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,191
"Mommy,
is that the baby?"

907
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,312
- Oh.
- I wish.

908
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,519
Hey, everyone.

909
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,393
- And so we meet again.
- Oh, hi.

910
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,669
Romy White.

911
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,917
You're the chubby girl.

912
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:13,352
Oh, well, I was, but I haven't
been for a really long time.

913
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,914
So, what are
all of you up to?

914
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,793
Christie, in the yearbook you said
that you wanted Jane Pauley's job.

915
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,753
Are you a big TV news
anchorwoman now?

916
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,236
Oh, no, I don't even
watch TV any more.

917
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,909
My priorities have changed
since I became a mommy.

918
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,429
Can you believe
this is number three?

919
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,835
Wow, three kids.

920
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,996
God, you must feel
really tied down.

921
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,911
Not at all.
I feel very fulfilled.

922
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,749
Besides, Billy always
wanted a big family.

923
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,033
- Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

924
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,072
- You married Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

925
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,714
For almost ten years now.

926
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,479
Billy's in
real estate development.

927
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,155
So, how about you?
Any kids?

928
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,757
Oh, uh, no.

929
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,555
I just haven't had time, you know, what
with running my own business and all.

930
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,477
Your own business?

931
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,036
Yeah.
I invented Post-lts.

932
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,357
No, really.
What do you do?

933
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,832
That's what I do.
I invented Post-lts.

934
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,872
Oh. You're kidding me.

935
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,590
Well, I've made
a lot of money.

936
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,632
Oh, you know who they say
has made a ton of money? Sandy Frink.

937
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,557
- The Frink-a-zoid?
- Yeah.

938
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,229
He invented some special kind
of rubber that's used in every
tennis shoe in North America.

939
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,828
Hey, if anybody
needs to make a call...

940
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,394
I've got a phone.

941
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,957
- Is Sandy Frink here?
- Uh, no.

942
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,833
-Uh, you can't go in without a name tag.
-Fuck off!

943
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,112
Heather Mooney? Oh, my God,
you're exactly the same.

944
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,674
Oh, my God.
Heather Mooney is here?

945
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,670
This ought to be so good.

946
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,235
Oh, God, don't look now.
It's Heather Mooney.

947
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,999
- What?
- Hello, Romy.

948
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,509
Uh-- E-- Uh-- You--

949
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,076
Oh, uh-- Heather,
you said you weren't coming.

950
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,590
Yeah, well, since Sandy
and Michele aren't married--

951
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,995
What a waste
of a tank of gas, huh?

952
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,431
Okay, well, come on.
I'll help you go find him.

953
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,870
Uh, he's not here. I already asked Toby
Dumbfuck. Obviously, I've interrupted.

954
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,798
Why don't you just go back to ignoring
me like you did in high school?

955
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,717
No, you can stay.

956
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,958
We're just discussing our class
success stories. So, what are you up to?

957
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,913
Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?
I invented the quick-burning paper.

958
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,191
- Wow, we have a whole class
full of inventors.
- Meaning?

959
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,117
Oh, you know, Sandy Frink
invented something too.

960
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,993
- Hey, isn't that Sandy over there now?
- What did Sandy invent?

961
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,477
- Some kind of rubber.
- Romy here invented Post-lts.
- You did not.

962
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,589
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

963
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,630
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

964
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,988
Yeah, l--
Well, who did then?

965
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,236
A guy named Art Fry
from the 3M Corp.

966
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,715
We studied it
in business school.

967
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,999
You're kidding me.

968
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,714
You just
made all that up?

969
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,200
Oh, God,
you are so weird.

970
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,796
- Why don't you just leave her alone?
- Michele.

971
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,957
Oh, it's
the back brace girl.

972
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,674
- Hi, back brace girl.
- Hi, back brace girl.

973
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,553
Oh, shut up.

974
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,636
And what are you
picking on us for anyway?

975
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,035
We are not the ones
who got fat.

976
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,913
We're pregnant,
you half-wit.

977
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,793
Oh, yeah, well...

978
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,957
I hope your babies
look like monkeys.

979
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,911
Come on, Romy.

980
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,396
- Oh, Romy.
- Oh, please, go away.
Just leave me alone.

981
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,432
Why did I even
come back here?

982
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,120
Well, you know what? There are worse
things than telling some dumb story...

983
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,117
and having everybody
laugh at you.

984
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:38,519
- Like what?
- Like losing your best friend.

985
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,437
You know? I mean,
I had the worst dream, Romy.

986
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,678
I dreamt that we weren't friends
and we were really, really old.

987
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,360
But I mean, like, we were, like,
really, really old.

988
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,436
And-And we weren't friends.

989
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,517
I can't stand that
we're mad at each other.

990
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,473
Okay, I'm sorry
I said all those things.

991
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,319
You're as cute as me.
You are.

992
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,069
And-And in some cultures,
maybe cuter.

993
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,509
I'm sorry too.

994
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,633
I shouldn't have said that you weren't
smart enough to invent Post-lts.

995
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,513
Well, I mean,
maybe I'm not.

996
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:17,349
Although in my dream,
I did know the formula for glue.

997
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,110
So, are we friends again?

998
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,637
Well, duh.

999
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,711
Okay.

1000
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,637
And you know what,
it doesn't even matter...

1001
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,832
that we told, like, what,
four people some dumb lie.

1002
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,190
Who cares?

1003
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,880
Hi, everybody.

1004
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,117
Settle down. Hi.

1005
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,710
I'm Christie
Masters-Christianson.

1006
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,033
I have been asked
to formally welcome you all...

1007
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,675
to Sagebrush High's
ten-year reunion.

1008
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,431
We have come a long way
in the past ten years.

1009
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,393
Our own Lisa Luder is helping
set the style for the country...

1010
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,034
as a fashion editor
for "Vogue" magazine.

1011
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,074
And Travis McKinney
is in his fifth year...

1012
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,317
as a member of the
Dallas Cowboys football team.

1013
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,310
And...

1014
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,715
Romy and Michele claimed...

1015
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,434
they invented Post-lts.

1016
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,717
All I ever wanted was
for people to think...

1017
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,637
that we were better
than we were in high school.

1018
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,991
And now we're just a stupid joke,
just like we always were.

1019
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,274
No, Romy.

1020
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,157
Can I tell you the truth?

1021
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,070
I never knew that we weren't
that great in high school.

1022
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,475
I mean, we always had
so much fun together.

1023
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,511
I thought high school
was a blast.

1024
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,677
And until you told me that
our lives weren't good enough...

1025
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,190
I thought everything
since high school was a blast.

1026
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,914
I think we should go back
out there as ourselves...

1027
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,793
and just have fun
like we always do.

1028
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,831
The hell with
everyone else.

1029
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,633
I don't think I can.

1030
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,832
Well, do you think you can
stop being such a baby?

1031
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,877
God, I feel like
I've been, like...

1032
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,797
chasing you all over
this reunion.

1033
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,717
We have come
all this way.

1034
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:51,311
Now we are going to enjoy ourselves
whether you like it or not.

1035
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:55,228
God, Michele, I've never seen this side
of your personality before.

1036
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,237
You're so bossy
and domineering.

1037
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,713
- I like it.
- Me too.

1038
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,388
She's got it

1039
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,273
Yeah, baby
she's got it

1040
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,269
- I don't believe it.
- What?

1041
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,719
They're ba-ack.

1042
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,759
Well, I'm your Venus

1043
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,677
- Nice outfits.
- I'm your fire

1044
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,553
Post-lts must be
really lucrative.

1045
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,000
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Oh, yeah, Michele, I am so sure.

1046
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,914
What the hell is
your problem, Christie?

1047
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,315
Why are you always
such a nasty bitch?

1048
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,679
Do you get some kind of sick pleasure
from torturing other people?

1049
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,190
I mean, yeah, okay, so Michele and I
did make up some lame story.

1050
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,914
We only did it because we wanted you
to treat us like human beings.

1051
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,837
But you know what
I finally realized?

1052
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,918
I don't care if you like us
'cause we don't like you.

1053
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,837
You're a bad person
with an ugly heart...

1054
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,713
and we don't give a flying fuck
what you think.

1055
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,834
- Come on, Michele.
- Okay.

1056
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,599
And, yeah.

1057
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,632
It's unbelievable.
They're as deluded about their lives...

1058
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,716
as they are about
those hideous clothes.

1059
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,632
Actually, Christie,
they've got nice lines...

1060
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,876
a fun,
frisky use of colour.

1061
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,152
All in all, I'd have to say
they're really not bad.

1062
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,155
Well, we still think
they're ridiculous.

1063
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,077
Don't we, girls?

1064
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,032
Why don't you just let them
think for themselves for once?

1065
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,549
You're just jealous...

1066
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:05,754
because unlike a certain ball-busting,
dried-up career woman I might mention...

1067
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,155
we're all happily married.

1068
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,350
That's right, Christie.

1069
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,471
Keep telling
yourself that.

1070
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,999
- I do love those outfits.
- Yeah, sure do.

1071
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,951
- Oh, great.
- Thanks.

1072
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,991
Michele made them.

1073
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,829
Well, I just sewed them.
We both designed them.

1074
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,520
- Fifty-fifty.
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1075
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,278
That's so cool.

1076
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,717
Well, it's been really
terrific seeing all of you.

1077
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,910
- Come on, Michele.
- Oh, okay, bye.

1078
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,790
Hi.

1079
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:52,592
I am sorry that I blew
your big lie for you.

1080
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,269
Hey, that's okay.
It was better this way anyway.

1081
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,439
It's ironic, isn't it? I really thought
you guys had it made in high school.

1082
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,152
- Us?
- Yes, you.

1083
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,953
With your long hair
and your long legs...

1084
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,116
walkin' on your legs,
flippin' your hair.

1085
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,071
I can't compete with that.
You made Sandy crazy.

1086
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,668
And the whole time
you were makin' my life hell...

1087
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,189
the "A" group was making
your life hell; I didn't know.

1088
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,677
You know what? I bet in high school
everybody made somebody's life hell.

1089
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,873
Mm-mmm, not me. Never had the
opportunity to make anyone's life hell.

1090
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,356
You know what? I bet that's not true.
You were really unpleasant.

1091
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,277
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. God.

1092
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,516
Heather?
Oh, I'm off duty.

1093
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,200
Um, since you never
got around to it in high school...

1094
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,788
I was wondering
if you could sign my yearbook.

1095
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,912
And, uh, please don't
tell me to fuck off...

1096
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,917
because it really hurts
my feelings.

1097
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,277
- I hurt your feelings?
- Yeah, all the time.

1098
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,153
Tremendous!
That's tremendous!

1099
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,714
Go get your stupid yearbook.
I would be happy to sign it.

1100
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,469
Okay, great.
I'll-l'll be right back, okay?

1101
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,319
Michele, I think maybe
we should leave.

1102
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,829
There is no way this reunion
is gonna get any better.

1103
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:04,795
Hey, everybody, Sandy Frink
just landed in a helicopter!

1104
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,836
Sandy Frink
has a helicopter?

1105
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,712
Yeah. Apparently he's worth,
like, millions.

1106
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,230
He invented some kind of
special rubber or something.

1107
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,828
Like for condoms?

1108
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,233
Whoa-ohh-ohh

1109
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,191
The hot summer night

1110
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,595
Fell like a net

1111
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,358
I've gotta find
my baby yet

1112
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,998
You think I'm cute

1113
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,237
A little bit shy

1114
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:50,911
Mama, I ain't
that kind of guy

1115
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,352
That's Sandy Frink?
What the hell was I thinking?

1116
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,879
Whoa-ohh-ohh

1117
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,317
Sandy, hi.

1118
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,431
- Doctor, Doctor, give me the news
- You look so rich.

1119
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,553
- I got a bad case of lovin' you
- I mean, great.

1120
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,796
No pill's gonna
cure my ill

1121
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:17,358
I got a bad case
of lovin' you

1122
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,030
Michele.

1123
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:26,075
- After all these years,
you still take my breath away.
- Thanks.

1124
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,510
So you must be, like,
the most successful person...

1125
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,471
in our entire
graduating class.

1126
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,952
Well, I guess that depends
on how you define "success."

1127
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,629
If, to you, success means
having a house in Aspen...

1128
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,435
one in Acapulco, a penthouse in
New York, a mansion in Malibu...

1129
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,074
a 60-foot yacht,
an eight-seat Windstar...

1130
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,078
a Bell Jet Ranger, a Bentley,
a personal trainer, a full-time chef...

1131
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,997
a live-in masseuse
and a staff of 24...

1132
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,236
then, yeah...

1133
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,351
I guess I am successful.

1134
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,237
But no matter
how much I accumulate...

1135
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,477
there's still one thing
I just don't have.

1136
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,192
Your own country?

1137
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,316
I don't have you,
Michele.

1138
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,837
Will you dance with me?

1139
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,350
Only if Romy
can dance with us.

1140
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,277
Sure.

1141
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,196
Lying in my bed

1142
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,996
I hear the clock tick
and think of you

1143
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,873
Caught up in circles

1144
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,834
Confusion is nothing new

1145
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,873
Flashback
Warm nights

1146
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,992
Almost left behind

1147
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,908
Suitcase of memories

1148
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,397
Time after
Sometimes you picture me

1149
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,195
I'm walkin'
too far ahead

1150
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,232
You're callin' to me

1151
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,399
I can't hear
what you've said

1152
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,559
Then you say "Go slow"

1153
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,752
I fall behind

1154
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,348
The second hand unwinds

1155
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,837
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

1156
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:38,554
Time after time

1157
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,832
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

1158
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,554
Time after time

1159
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,992
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

1160
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,429
Time after time

1161
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,357
If you fall
I will catch you

1162
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,040
- I'll be waiting
- I will be waiting

1163
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,673
Time after time

1164
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,517
Time after time

1165
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,196
Time after time

1166
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,672
Time after time

1167
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,075
Time after time

1168
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,631
See, I told you
it would pay off...

1169
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:19,035
to go to those clubs
every night.

1170
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,069
Come on.

1171
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,439
Oh, Jesus,
Mary and Joseph.

1172
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,391
What do you want?

1173
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,910
You were right. I was
a brain-dead, redneck asshole.

1174
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,996
Although I never screwed
a sheep or my sister.

1175
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,190
Why not?
Couldn't catch 'em?

1176
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:45,233
I guess I deserve that.
I was a jerk.

1177
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,757
But I was so miserable
in high school...

1178
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,758
I don't think I spoke more than
two words the entire time.

1179
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,793
I just couldn't
breathe there, you know?

1180
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,195
Plus, I had this
really bad stutter.

1181
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:03,116
Listen, you, uh,
wanna go somewhere quiet?

1182
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,231
Somewhere
where we can talk?

1183
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,636
- You-You wanna talk to me?
- Yeah.

1184
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,036
Okay, cowboy, I don't know
what your trip is...

1185
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,993
- but if this is some kind
of a sick game--
- What? No.

1186
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,714
If you fuck with me
in any way, I will rip...

1187
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,957
each and every appendage from your body,
starting with your dick, capisce?

1188
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,869
Look, I j-just
w-wanted to talk.

1189
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,676
Okay.

1190
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,631
What the hell.

1191
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,079
What is your name?

1192
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,997
- Clarence.
- I like your hat, Clarence.

1193
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,951
- Thank you.
- Pick up the pace.

1194
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,554
You wait here.
I'll prep my chopper.

1195
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,477
- Okay.
- All right.

1196
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,959
Oh, my God, somebody's
puking in the bushes.

1197
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,877
Eeewww!

1198
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,916
Hey, how you guys doin'?

1199
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,119
Billy?

1200
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:11,630
- Chubbo?
- The name is Romy.

1201
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,191
Romy and Michele.

1202
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,192
So, weren't you guys, like,
totally in love with me in high school?

1203
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,356
She was.

1204
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,116
You wanna get a room?

1205
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,470
But you're married.

1206
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,876
- To Christie.
- Yeah, but you've got children...

1207
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,037
and you're a successful
real estate developer.

1208
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:46,036
I do drywall for her old man's
construction company.

1209
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:49,709
And-And you know this new kid?
Don't even know if he's mine.

1210
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,277
So--

1211
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,595
How about that room?

1212
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,917
Okay.

1213
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,314
Why don't you go
and get that room?

1214
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,876
Go and wash your face
and take off all your clothes...

1215
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,956
and I'll be up there
in five minutes.

1216
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,718
All right!

1217
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:18,515
Your fantasy
is gonna come true...

1218
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,596
tonight.

1219
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,116
- See you later.
- Ugh-- Okay.

1220
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,158
- God.
- Now he's gonna see what
it feels like to wait.

1221
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,999
- That's such a good one.
- Ladies.

1222
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:45,194
- God, can you believe we're
going home in a helicopter?
- I know. It's so cool.

1223
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,710
I just wish everybody inside the reunion
would come out and see us lift off.

1224
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,319
Ohh!

1225
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,237
Thank you.

1226
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,033
Oh.

1227
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,671
Oh, my God! I'm so glad you didn't
bring your big notebook with you.

1228
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,392
Michele.

1229
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,069
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth

1230
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,954
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1231
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,470
They say in heaven
love comes first

1232
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,831
We'll make heaven
a place on earth

1233
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,350
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1234
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,756
Billy. Billy!

1235
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,269
Billy, where are you?

1236
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,716
Billy. Damn it.
Damn it!

1237
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,190
Oh, my God.
Is that Heather?

1238
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,993
Go for it, Heather!

1239
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,317
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth

1240
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,949
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1241
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,550
They say in heaven
love comes first

1242
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,477
Thanks for stopping by.

1243
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,511
Yeah. Enjoy your fashions.

1244
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,437
Have a Romy and Michele day.

1245
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,994
- That was a good one.
- Thanks.

1246
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,350
I cannot believe
how busy we've been.

1247
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,189
I know. Hey, maybe we can
pay back Sandy this week.

1248
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,153
Um, I think we're about, like,
two years away from that.

1249
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,999
Oh. Okay.

1250
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,590
Heather, um, has anyone ever told you
that smoking can kill you?

1251
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,757
No. No one. Thank you.

1252
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,348
Okay, but if you burn it,
you bought it.

1253
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,869
Like I give a shit.
I look like an asshole.

1254
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,150
What? Nuh-uh.
You look totally cute.

1255
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,637
This dress exacerbates the genetic
betrayal that is my legacy.

1256
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,990
Okay, I don't even know what you're
talking about because of those words...

1257
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,917
but come here.

1258
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,998
- Ow!
- God, that has been bugging me.

1259
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,715
- Stay away from my bikini area.
- Um, okay.

1260
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,877
- I'm in a rush. Ring it up if you must.
- Okay.

1261
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,956
Let me have the tag, please.

1262
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,877
Thank you.

1263
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,797
You really do look cute.

1264
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,115
- You know what?
- Huh?

1265
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:14,313
Despite that surly demeanour, I think
we've just given her a big gift.

1266
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,556
Okay, I mean,
to give someone...

1267
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:20,116
Iike Heather Mooney the chance
to express herself through fashion--

1268
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,549
We could've really
changed her life.

1269
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,638
Yeah. For me though,
it's like...

1270
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,513
I've given birth to
my own baby girl, you know?

1271
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,596
Only she's, like,
a big giant girl...

1272
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,473
who smokes
and says "shit" a lot.

1273
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,433
- You know?
- Yeah.

1274
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,075
- Yeah. Let's fold scarves!
- Okay.

1275
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,317
- You know what, Michele?
- Huh?

1276
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,829
I think you are, like,
the funnest person I know.

1277
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,076
Me too.
With you.

1278
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,438
See the people
walkin' down the street

1279
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,472
Fall in line
Just watchin' all the feet

1280
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,034
They don't know
where everyone can go

1281
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,469
But they're walkin'
in time

1282
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,160
They got the beat
They got the beat

1283
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:15,637
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat

1284
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,752
All the kids
just gettin' out of school

1285
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,792
They can't wait
to hang out and be cool

1286
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,036
Hang around
till quarter after twelve

1287
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,754
That's when

Kids got the beat

Go Go music
really makes us dance

1291
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:04,072
In the crowd
it puts us in a trance

1292
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,316
We want to
So just give us a chance

1293
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,034
That's when
