1
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:12,472
Take this pink ribbon
off my eyes

2
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:16,893
I'm exposed
and it's no big surprise

3
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:20,897
Don't ya think I know
exactly where I stand

4
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:26,319
This world is forcing me
to hold your hand

5
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:30,073
'Cause I'm just a girl
Well, little old me

6
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:34,786
Well don't let me
out of your sight

7
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,289
Oh, I'm just a girl

8
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:39,374
All pretty and petite

9
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:44,129
So don't let me
have any rights

10
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:49,468
Oh I've had it
up to here

11
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:56,892
The moment that
I step outside

12
00:00:57,017 --> 00:01:01,146
So many reasons
for me to run and hide

13
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:05,650
I can't do the little things
I hold so dear

14
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:10,697
'Cause it's all those
little things that I fear

15
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:14,868
'Cause I'm just a girl
I'd rather not be

16
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:19,456
'Cause they won't let me
drive late at night

17
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:23,752
Oh, I'm just a girl
Guess I'm some kind of freak

18
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:28,715
'Cause they all sit
and stare with their eyes

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,179
Oh, am I making myself clear

20
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:42,104
I'm just a girl

21
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,774
I'm just a girl in the world

22
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,861
- How much is this, Lori?
- It's very expensive.

23
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,947
It's very expensive.

24
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,533
Look, I got money
to spend in here.

25
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:59,538
I don't think we have anything for you.
You're obviously in the wrong place.

26
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:01,707
Please leave.

27
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:05,544
You know, even though we've watched
"Pretty Woman" like 36 times...

28
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:09,464
- I never get tired of making fun of it.
- Oh, I know.

29
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:14,636
Aww, poor thing. Look!
They won't let her shop.

30
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,765
Yeah, like those salesgirls in Beverly
Hills aren't bigger whores than she is.

31
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,809
I know!

32
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:25,647
Oh, my God, listen to that
sad, sad music as she leaves.

33
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,358
It's like, boo-hoo. Uhh.

34
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:33,030
But it is actually
kind of sad.

35
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,369
Anything you see here we can do, by the
way. Get ready to have some fun, okay?

36
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,621
- Okay.
- Mary Pat, Mary Kate,
Mary Frances, Tovah.

37
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:45,125
- Let's see it, come on!
Let's see the outfit.
- How divine!

38
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,961
Exactly how obscene--

39
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:52,215
I just get really happy
when they finally let her shop.

40
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,136
Okay, so I have
nothing to wear.

41
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,930
We don't even have time to make
anything new before we go out.

42
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,308
Well, what about this?

43
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:05,979
- Did you lose weight?
- Actually, I have been trying
this new fat-free diet I invented.

44
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:10,025
All I've had to eat for the past
six days are Gummi Bears,
jelly beans, and candy corns.

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,737
God, I wish I had
your discipline.

46
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:16,573
- This is it
- Work this

47
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,825
- Diddy-bum diddy-bum pow
- Here it is

48
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,578
I can't believe
how cute I look!

49
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:25,749
I know! You know what? This is like
the cutest we've ever looked.

50
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:29,461
Oh, it's definitely the cutest.
Don't you love how we can just
say that to each other...

51
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,047
- and we know that we're
not being conceited?
- Oh, I know.

52
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:35,175
No, we're just
being honest.

53
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:38,804
- Be my lover, Wanna be my lover
- Lover

54
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:45,644
Go ahead and take your time
Boy you gotta feel secure

55
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,772
Before I make you mine
Baby you have to be sure

56
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:52,317
You wanna be my lover
Wanna be my lover

57
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:56,071
God. I hope some cute guys get here
tonight. They were cute last night.

58
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:59,449
- Oh, they were cute.
- Really cute!
- Oh!

59
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,411
- Hey, Michele! Romy!
- We'll take two Diet Cokes?

60
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:05,664
Right, with extra cherries.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

61
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:11,044
Okay. I have the yuckiest taste
in my mouth from those taquitos.

62
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,922
- Eeew.
- I hope I don't get indigestion.

63
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:17,759
Hey, remember that time I barfed
from bad Mexican food? It was so gross.

64
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:21,888
- Oh, my God, I hate
throwing up in public.
- Me too! Ooh.

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,108
I can't believe it. There are
absolutely no guys here tonight.

66
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,569
I know. None.

67
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:38,363
Come on, Michele, let's just
go dance with ourselves.

68
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,407
Okay.

69
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:42,409
Put your hands in the air

70
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:45,245
'Cause there's a party over here
So grab yourself a beer

71
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,665
And we could
get on with the world

72
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,669
Swear to God.
Sometimes I wish I were a lesbian.

73
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:56,173
You wanna try and have sex sometime?
Just to see if we are?

74
00:04:56,298 --> 00:05:00,719
What? Yeah, right, Michele.
Just the thought of having sex
with another woman creeps me out.

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,475
But if we're not married by
the time we're 30, ask me again.

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,353
- Okay.
- Tell me can you feel the

77
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,605
Masked girls comin'
with the fever, fever, fever

78
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,068
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

79
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:20,530
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

80
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:25,077
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

81
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:29,873
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

82
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:34,044
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

83
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,672
- Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
- Two-four-three.

84
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:40,884
- Stayin' alive
- Two-four-three.

85
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,303
Two-four-three.

86
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,599
Two, four, three.

87
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,979
Two, four, three.

88
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:57,734
Service.
Number 243.

89
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,736
It's beautiful.
Is that real wood?

90
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,863
During this century, boys.

91
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:10,288
Come on, Ramon. Quit jerking off
and bring the car around.

92
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:22,092
- It's about time.
- Mm. Romy!

93
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:25,012
You are looking hot today.

94
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:28,265
Yeah. That's because
I'm sweating like a pig in here.

95
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,143
Well, the air conditioning is
working in the service office.

96
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:36,440
You might wanna come by
and, uh, cool off later?

97
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:39,693
Yeah, Ramon.
That'll happen.

98
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:43,363
Sorry, ma'am.
He is such an asshole.

99
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:46,241
Mm.

100
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:49,036
- I'm in a hurry.
- Well--

101
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:54,791
I'm going as fast as I can,
Ms Mooney. Heather.

102
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,127
Heather Mooney?

103
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:59,421
From Sagebrush High
in Tucson?

104
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:04,968
- Yeah?
- It's Romy!

105
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,471
- Romy White!
- You're shittin' me.

106
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:11,099
No, this is so weird. I didn't
know you were living in L.A.

107
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:14,644
Well, now that you know, will
we be getting together a lot?

108
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,941
So, God!
You're driving a new Jaguar?

109
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,527
- What do you do?
- Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?

110
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:26,615
- The ones that burn down real fast?
- "Twice the taste, in half the
time, for the gal on the go"?

111
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,911
I invented the
quick-burning paper.

112
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,997
Wow!

113
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,750
- You goin' to the reunion?
- What reunion?

114
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,670
Our ten-year high school
reunion in Tucson?

115
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:43,340
You're kidding me. It's been
ten years since high school?

116
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:48,095
- God. Where have I been?
- I'm stumped. Where?

117
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,682
- Anyway, are you going?
- I'd rather put this out in my ass.

118
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:55,727
I wonder why we didn't
get an invitation.

119
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,522
I mean, I'm sure Michele would
have told me if she got one.

120
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,816
- Michele Weinberger?
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:05,028
- Do you live with Michele Weinberger?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:10,117
I just thought maybe she'd
be married to Sandy by now.

123
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:12,786
- Sandy Frink?
- Yes, Sandy Frink.

124
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,122
He could barely contain his erection
every time she was around.

125
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:18,291
Why do you think he always
carried that huge notebook?

126
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:21,420
The Frink-a-zoid
and Michele, I am sure.

127
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:25,507
Besides, didn't you have a thing
for Sandy in high school?

128
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:30,762
I did not have a "thing." I did not have
a "thing." I did not have a "thing."

129
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,848
I was very much
in love with him.

130
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:35,308
Very much in love,
and there's a difference.

131
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:39,896
There's a difference.

132
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:41,898
There's a difference.

133
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:46,236
I have to go now.

134
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:52,909
Well! I guess I won't be
seeing you at the reunion.

135
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:55,287
- But I'll tell everyone you said "hi."
- Why don't you tell everyone...

136
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:58,957
I said to go fuck themselves, for making
my teen years a living hell?

137
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:00,709
Oh, yeah, right!

138
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,007
Finally--

139
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:12,971
Michele. You will never guess
who I just ran into.

140
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:18,935
- God, I cannot believe
it's already been ten years.
- I know.

141
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:21,563
- Oh.
- You know...
- There she is.

142
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:25,192
Oh! God,
she was so weird.

143
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,528
- She still is.
- Why was she, like, always
going behind that building?

144
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:40,624
It was long ago

145
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:44,628
Seems like yesterday

146
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:48,590
Saw you standin' in the rain

147
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:52,552
- Then I heard you say
- Got a light?

148
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:56,556
- I want your love
But it comes out wrong
- Thank you.

149
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:00,727
- I want to live, but I don't belong
- Thank you! Thank you,
I really appreciate that...

150
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:04,147
because I'm not a human being
or anything, you pathetic turd!

151
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:11,405
Blood and roses
Blood and roses

152
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,991
Blood and roses

153
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:20,080
- Roses, roses
- There should be a cigarette
you could smoke all the way
through between classes.

154
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:22,874
What a waste.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,169
- Okay.
- Find us.
- Oh. Okay.

156
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,298
Oh, my God, do you remember
what a big controversy it was...

157
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:34,011
for us to have our
picture taken together?

158
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:38,015
Yeah, well, Danny Weller, like,
"lodged the complaint," and, you know--

159
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,518
'Cause, "alphabetically,
he's supposed to be between us."

160
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:46,648
And then we said, "Okay, Danny.
If you want to be between us...

161
00:10:46,773 --> 00:10:49,776
you can come to Michele's house on
Friday night, and we'll be waiting."

162
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,987
That's right. He came over and
we're like, "Danny, it was a joke."

163
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,823
I know! And then we turned
the sprinklers on him!

164
00:10:56,908 --> 00:11:00,787
Oh, my God.
Didn't he die?

165
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:04,458
- I think so.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:10,797
- Oh, my God. Michele.
Look at the "A" group.
- Mm-hmm.

167
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:13,383
Christie Masters,
Kelly Possenger...

168
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:15,802
Lisa Luder
and Cheryl Quick.

169
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,724
So, who would you say
was in the "B" group?

170
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:23,852
Oh. The drama crowd. You know,
like Casey Degan and Mark Black.

171
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:28,357
- Uh-huh. God, I had the hugest
crush on Casey. 'Member?
- Oh, yeah.

172
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,359
God, I wonder why
he never liked me.

173
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:34,988
Young man, there's
no need to feel down

174
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:37,074
I said, young man--

175
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,743
So, what group would
you say we were in?

176
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,412
Well, we definitely
weren't in the "A" group.

177
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:45,540
But you know what? We weren't
really in the "B" group, either.

178
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,793
Okay, we weren't in
the "C" group, were we?

179
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:51,755
What? Oh, no. Michele, come on.
I mean, that was like,
all the honour students and like...

180
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,508
the rejects; you know, like
Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.

181
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:58,011
- Eeew, look at them.
- We were definitely not in that group.

182
00:11:58,136 --> 00:12:00,597
- Ecch.
- She blinded me with Science

183
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:04,768
Michele! Oh, Michele.
Over here!

184
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:06,770
Want me to get your
huge notebook for you?

185
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:10,524
Oh! Heather! I wanna
take another picture of you and
Sandy for the yearbook and--

186
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,609
Oh! I wanna
interview you too...

187
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:15,320
because I think it would make a really
interesting article for the "Roundup."

188
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:18,115
Ohh, Toby! Fuck off.

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,617
Okay. But can I take
a picture of you first?

190
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:24,788
So, Romy, what group
were we in?

191
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,001
Well, you know, I'm not sure that
we were really in any group.

192
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:31,962
I think maybe we were
more like loners.

193
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,383
- Oh, my God! There we are!
- Yeah, and alone. Look.

194
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:39,845
You know, even though I had
to wear that stupid back brace,
and you were kinda fat...

195
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,847
we were still totally
cutting edge.

196
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:45,100
- I love it when it's hamburger day.
- Uh-huh.

197
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:49,646
Okay, smile! Great!
Thanks a lot!

198
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:52,983
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, please.
- Hello, girls.

199
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:56,111
Don't forget, you have
detention after school today.

200
00:12:56,236 --> 00:13:00,282
- Oh, we won't, Mr Lish.
- Yeah, we're really
looking forward to it.

201
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:09,166
- God!
- Can you believe he just got married?

202
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:14,379
- Like, how desperate is she?
- I know, it's like:
"Hi. This is my husband.

203
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:17,883
He dissects crayfish, but he
has a really good personality."

204
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:22,429
He's the kind of man
that I desire

205
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:27,059
Sets the summer sun
on fire

206
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:31,229
- I want candy
- Oh, my God.

207
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:36,193
- I want candy
- Michele. Billy Christianson.

208
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:39,780
- Oh, he's so cute.
- He is cute.
- Really cute.

209
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:48,413
- Hey
- Hi, Billy.
- Hey

210
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,540
Hey

211
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,626
Hey

212
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:55,128
- Hey
- Ow! Billy!

213
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:59,049
Oh, Billy, gosh,
you're so slimy.

214
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:02,678
I cannot believe he's
with Christie Masters.

215
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,722
I know. She is, like,
so transparent.

216
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,849
Did you hear her report
in Miss Weigatt's class?

217
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:12,145
She actually thinks she's gonna be a
TV anchorwoman. What a "deludanoid."

218
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,734
Those weirdos are
staring at us again.

219
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:20,821
- They're obsessed with us.
- Look at what they're wearing.

220
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:23,490
Where do you even get
outfits that hideous?

221
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:26,535
They made them in Home Ec
from their own patterns.

222
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,204
Actually, I think
they're semi-interesting.

223
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,546
In a freakish, off-putting
sort of way. Never mind.

224
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:39,548
- Christie.
- Uh.
- Come on, I'm hungry.

225
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:42,509
No, Billy. Wait.
I wanna have some fun.

226
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:45,554
Lisa, gimme the bag.

227
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:53,729
Here you go.
You are so bad.

228
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:58,734
- What? What?
- She is out of control.

229
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:06,033
Michele? Christie Masters
is coming over here.

230
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:10,037
- Wow. She never comes over.
- Okay, just act cool.

231
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,544
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Christie.

232
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:22,507
- So. You girls gonna try out
for the spring musical?
- Us?

233
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:27,137
Yeah, you should.
It'll be fun.

234
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:33,310
- Okay. Why not?
- Yeah. So, um, what
musical are they doing?

235
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:36,480
- "The Music Man."
- You're kidding!

236
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:40,150
Oh, the Wells Fargo wagon
ls a-comin' down the street

237
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:43,111
I love "The Music Man."

238
00:15:43,236 --> 00:15:47,991
Okay. Can I have
the rest of this?

239
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:51,662
Um, w--

240
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:54,665
Mm. It's good.

241
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,837
See ya!

242
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:04,257
She can be really nice
when she wants to be.

243
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:07,260
Michele!

244
00:16:09,513 --> 00:16:14,184
- Uh-oh. Don't look now.
Here come the Frink-a-zoid.
- Oh, God! He is such a geek!

245
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:18,522
Hi, Michele. Gee, Michele,
you're looking really lovely today.

246
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:22,818
Okay. See you in Biology.

247
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:28,156
I-l-l thought I ought
to tell you, Michele, that...

248
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:32,786
Christie Masters stuck
magnets on your back.

249
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:34,830
- What?
- She stuck--

250
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:37,040
Michele, you do have
magnets on your back!

251
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:40,210
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

252
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:42,713
Oh, my God.
Help me.

253
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:44,715
Oh, my God.

254
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:50,012
Oh, don't let them see you get upset.
That's what they want.

255
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:54,558
Oh, my God.

256
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:57,519
- Hey!
- I'm pretending you just
did something hilarious.

257
00:16:57,644 --> 00:16:59,896
Now, you laugh at me.
Come on, do it.

258
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:16,621
God, that was so rude. I mean, you
couldn't help it if you had scoliosis.

259
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:22,002
I know. And what a bitch, taking
your hamburger. I mean, what was that?

260
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:27,007
God, remember the prom?
You got so thin by then.

261
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:32,679
Oh, I know. I was so lucky,
getting mono. That was, like,
the best diet ever.

262
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:36,641
I wonder, if I had gotten
my brace off sooner, if
somebody would have invited me.

263
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,977
I mean, other
than Sandy Frink.

264
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:41,271
Well, nobody
invited me either.

265
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:46,735
Well, at least we looked fantastic,
and that is the most important thing.

266
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,573
- We were cool on craze
- Oh, gee. Nice outfits. Really.

267
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:55,869
- When l, you
- Oh, look, it's the Madonna twins.
- And everyone we knew

268
00:17:55,994 --> 00:18:00,999
Could believe, do, and share
in what was true, Oh, I said

269
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:03,794
Okay, this is so typical.
Of course, we're like the only ones...

270
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,046
who don't look like
we're going to a hoedown.

271
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:09,341
-Oh, I know. This town is like so unhip.
-Ecch.

272
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:13,053
- I can't wait till we move to L.A.
- Me too!

273
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:16,807
Everything's gonna happen for us there,
Michele, and we'll never look back.

274
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:19,726
- Okay.
- Dance hall days

275
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:26,108
- Dance hall days
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

276
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:28,402
That hurt.
But it looked really good.

277
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,487
Dance hall days

278
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,489
Oh, everybody!

279
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:34,991
- Dance hall, dance hall days
- Okay, everyone.

280
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:38,870
Uh, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

281
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:42,666
It's time to announce
the king and queen of the prom.

282
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,877
- Ahh!
- And the winners are...

283
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:53,719
Billy Christianson
and Christie Masters!

284
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:57,222
Ohh! Ohh!

285
00:18:57,347 --> 00:19:00,809
- Duh.
- Oh, it's me!

286
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:06,231
Boo-hoo!
I'm so surprised!

287
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,650
Thank you. Thank you.

288
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:11,194
God, Billy looks
cute in his tux.

289
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,822
- He does look cute.
- Really cute.

290
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:21,330
Do you think, since it's
the last night of school and
I might never see him again...

291
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:24,708
that maybe he would
dance with me?

292
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,544
I bet he would.
I mean, it's senior prom.

293
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,047
Nobody's going to say "no"
to anyone tonight.

294
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:44,561
Michele, since this is the
last night of school and all...

295
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:47,689
would you care
to dance with me once?

296
00:19:47,814 --> 00:19:49,983
No.

297
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:55,739
I'll dance with you.

298
00:19:55,864 --> 00:20:00,243
Nah. It's no fun unless
you really love the person.

299
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:05,540
Thanks, anyway.

300
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,293
Okay. Who can name the capitals
of all the 50 states?

301
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:11,421
Okay, Toby. Fuck off.

302
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:15,842
Heather! Can't you be
a little bit more sensitive?

303
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:19,930
Me? Me? Me be
more sensitive?

304
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:21,932
You are a jerk-off!

305
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:26,144
Another kiss
is what it takes

306
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,271
- Albuquerque.
- You can't sleep

307
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,273
- You can't eat
- Albany.

308
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,442
There's no doubt

309
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,569
You're in deep

310
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:38,824
Your throat is tight
You can't breathe

311
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:43,453
Another kiss is all you need
Whoa-oh-ohh

312
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:46,873
- Why are you tormenting me?
- You like to think
you're immune to the stuff

313
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:52,212
- Why don't you go fuck a sheep
or your sister or yourself?
- Oh, yeah

314
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:54,840
Brain-dead
redneck asshole!

315
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:58,218
Can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it

316
00:20:58,343 --> 00:21:02,347
You're addicted to love
You see the signs

317
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:04,683
But you can't read

318
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:08,895
You're runnin' at
a different speed

319
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:13,233
Your heart beats
in double time

320
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:15,569
- Another kiss
- Um, Billy?

321
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,571
- And you'll be mine
- Hi.

322
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,034
- A one-track mind, you can't be saved
- Do you wanna dance?

323
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,495
- Oblivion is all you crave
- I mean, it's just 'cause...

324
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,457
this song is,
like, so great.

325
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:31,168
Mm. Never mind.

326
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:34,504
Unless, you know,
you want to.

327
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:37,049
- Whoa, you like to think
- Yeah. I mean--

328
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:39,176
- That you're immune to this stuff
- Y-Y-- Sure. Why not?

329
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:43,680
- Oh, yeah
- Really?
- Wh-- Um--

330
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,682
- It's closer to the truth
- Could you wait here?

331
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:48,477
- To say you can't get enough
- I-l-l'll be right back.
- Okay.

332
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:52,481
- Okay.
- You know, you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love

333
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:56,568
Might as well face it
You're addicted to love

334
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:58,570
- Might as well face it
- Hey, Christie.

335
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:02,199
- You're addicted to love
- That Romy girl just asked
me to dance with her.

336
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:05,786
- Might as well face it
- Oh, you're kidding me!
Oh, that's pathetic!

337
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:10,207
- Might as well face it
- W-W-W-What should I do?

338
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:12,417
Let me take care of this.

339
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:21,385
- Michele?
- Oh, God. Okay, so what did he say?

340
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,471
- "Sure. Why not?"
- Oh, my God!

341
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,687
- Thanks a lot, Romy.
- What?

342
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:33,855
Thanks for stealing
my boyfriend.

343
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,317
- What are you talking about?
- Billy just broke up with me.

344
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:40,112
Apparently he's had a crush on
you since Mr Roswell's class.

345
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:44,741
And now that he knows that
you like him, he doesn't want
to "pretend" with me any more.

346
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:48,453
My life was perfect
and you've ruined it.

347
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:51,415
Go for it
Groove ahead

348
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,459
I swear to God, Christie,
I didn't even think he'd dance with me.

349
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:58,422
- To whip it, Whip it good
- Wow. She is really P.O.'d.

350
00:22:58,547 --> 00:23:02,175
- This is so cool!
- Oh, I know.

351
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,346
You know what is so weird?
I had this dream, where Billy
was like, in love with me.

352
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:10,308
And I mean, he was in
a wheelchair, but still, it's like
it's coming true or something!

353
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:12,728
- Uh-huh.
- How's my hair?

354
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:15,814
Perfect. Okay, Romy, you look so
good with blonde hair and black roots.

355
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:19,109
- It's like, not even funny.
- I have to say...

356
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:23,113
this is turning out to be one of
the very best nights of my entire life.

357
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:25,365
Yay, yay!

358
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:43,258
Lyin' in my bed I hear
the clock tick

359
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:45,802
And think of you

360
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:48,889
Caught up in circles

361
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:53,101
Confusion is nothing new

362
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:56,980
Flashback to warm nights

363
00:23:57,105 --> 00:24:00,484
Almost left behind

364
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:04,488
- Suitcase of memories
- You know, maybe he's, like,
passed out in the bathroom.

365
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:06,490
- You want me to go check?
- Time after, Sometimes

366
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:09,785
- You picture me
- He's not in the bathroom, Michele.

367
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,288
I'm walkin' too far ahead

368
00:24:13,413 --> 00:24:16,416
- I'll dance with you, Romy.
- You're callin' to me

369
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:20,545
- I can't hear what you've said
- Okay.
- Okay.

370
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:24,758
Then you say "Go slow"

371
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:28,261
I fall behind

372
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:31,139
The second hand unwinds

373
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:35,936
If you're lost you can look
and you will find me

374
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:38,480
Time after time

375
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:43,193
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

376
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:45,696
Time after time

377
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:50,575
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

378
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:53,203
Time after time

379
00:24:53,328 --> 00:24:57,958
- If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting
- I will be waiting

380
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,586
Time after time

381
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:03,588
Time after time

382
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:05,882
We just waited and waited.

383
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:10,053
- God, I was such an idiot.
- But wait till he sees you now.

384
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:12,973
You are so much cuter
than you were in high school.

385
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:15,892
- I guess I'm cuter.
- Yeah!

386
00:25:16,018 --> 00:25:19,396
And look at the way we live.
I mean, just our lifestyle.

387
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:22,774
You know, I mean, we live in L.A,
and they are still stuck in Tucson.

388
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:30,073
You know what, Michele?
You're right.

389
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:33,118
We are gonna go back there
and blow them away.

390
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:40,625
Boy, there's a lot
of questions to answer.
Why do we have to fill these out?

391
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:43,337
They wanna know what we've been
doing for the past ten years.

392
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:47,841
- Oh!
- Okay. Here we go.

393
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:49,926
- Ahh!
- "Name."

394
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:53,513
- Ah! We're having so much fun already.
- Oh, I know!

395
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:56,850
- I cannot wait for this reunion.
- Me too!

396
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,313
"Occupation."
Cashier.

397
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:04,775
- Unemployed.
- No. Don't write that.

398
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,694
Um, okay, so your last job
was as a salesgirl?

399
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:12,407
- So say you're a freelance
fashion consultant.
- Ooh! Clever.

400
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:15,661
"Relationship Status."
Married.

401
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:19,289
- Nope.
- Engaged?
- No.

402
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:23,210
- Living with someone?
- Should I say you?

403
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:25,379
- I guess so.
- Okay.

404
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:33,220
- You know, Michele?
- Yeah?

405
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:36,431
- Now that I'm looking at this...
- Uh-huh?

406
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:39,726
our lives don't seem as
impressive as I thought.

407
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:42,145
- They don't?
- Well, do you think it's impressive...

408
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,565
that we're still single, and we've
been living together for ten years...

409
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:48,819
and I'm a cashier
and you're unemployed?

410
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:51,196
Well, not super impressive.

411
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:54,700
Well, then, what's the point of going
if we're not going to impress people?

412
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:58,787
Well-- Uh.

413
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:09,006
Romy, I still really,
really, really want to go.

414
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:14,803
- I know. Me too.
- Well then, can't we just,
like, think of something?

415
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:20,600
- Okay. Well, the reunion is still
like two weeks away, right?
- Right.

416
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:25,147
And all we really need is maybe some,
like, better jobs and boyfriends. Right?

417
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:27,691
Yeah!

418
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:32,320
But, okay. If those things were so easy
to get, wouldn't we already have them?

419
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:34,364
Well, I mean, we never
really tried before.

420
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:38,201
I mean, we never really had
a good enough reason, like going
to a reunion, to motivate us.

421
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,245
That's true.

422
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,916
Okay. So we're just gonna have to make
ourselves more impressive, that's all.

423
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:48,879
So I'm gonna go out and bag us
some boyfriends, while you can
look for a cool new job.

424
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:51,423
- Okay.
- Plus, I hate to say it...

425
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:53,508
but I really think that
we should lose some weight.

426
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:55,510
Oh.

427
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:01,266
Oh. Unh.

428
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:04,978
Okay. I don't think that, like,
one chip makes a difference.

429
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:07,272
It wasn't even
a whole chip.

430
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:20,994
All right. According to this chart,
if we want to lose a pound a day...

431
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,580
we have to burn twice
as many calories as we eat.

432
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:27,876
So, that means, if we want
to burn 4,000 calories...

433
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:31,338
we only have to run
20 miles a day!

434
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:34,800
Oh! Hey, Romy, remember
Mrs Chivas' class?

435
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:36,968
There was, like,
always a word problem.

436
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:39,346
Like, there's a guy in
a rowboat going "X" miles...

437
00:28:39,471 --> 00:28:42,933
and the current is going, like,
you know, some... other miles...

438
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:45,769
and, how long does it take him
to get to town?

439
00:28:45,894 --> 00:28:50,565
It was like, who cares? Who wants to go
to town with a guy who drives a rowboat?

440
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:53,360
Okay, guys, let's jump.

441
00:28:56,947 --> 00:29:00,742
- Hey, Michele?
- Yeah?
- What does this remind you of?

442
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:03,578
Well, I know.
This lady is totally sick.

443
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,963
Uh, lemme just
say that, um...

444
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,508
I am, like, really familiar
with the entire Versace line,
and if you would just...

445
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:22,055
give me a chance, I know I could,
like, sell the shit out of the stuff.

446
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,560
And, uh, to me,
fashion is just, it's like...

447
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:29,396
everything. It's--

448
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:32,941
By the way, that blouse-- Hi.
That blouse looks great on you.

449
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:36,987
- Oh! Thank you!
- And see, I make a great salesperson...

450
00:29:37,112 --> 00:29:39,239
'cause I just have this,
like, really believable way...

451
00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:43,618
of telling people that they
look really good, even though
I'm just, like, you know--

452
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,002
I think
she heard me.

453
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:55,255
Thank you so much
for coming.

454
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,801
- That's okay, you're welcome.
- I don't think we'll be
requiring any new staff.

455
00:29:59,926 --> 00:30:02,971
- You aren't taking on any what?
- Staff. Employees.

456
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:05,307
Ohh! Oh, "staff."

457
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:08,185
Okay, I didn't understand
with your big accent.

458
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,355
I couldn't
figure it out. Okay.

459
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,569
Fine. You know, you really shouldn't
let people fill out applications...

460
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:22,199
if you don't want them to
actually try to get a job here.

461
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:27,287
- It's a compli--
- No, no. That's all I have to say.
- Goodbye.

462
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:30,415
If there ain't no love
then there ain't no use

463
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,044
Ooh, better walk on by
Better walk on through

464
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:39,091
Hi. Hey, um, great suit.
Is that an Armani?

465
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:43,845
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- I thought so. So, what do you do?

466
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,057
- I'm a suit salesman.
- Oh, uh-oh

467
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:52,020
Would you excuse me?
I cut my foot before,
and my shoe is filling up with blood.

468
00:30:53,522 --> 00:30:56,608
Ooh, if there ain't no love
then there ain't no use

469
00:30:56,733 --> 00:31:00,445
Ooh, better walk on by
Better walk on through

470
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,241
Hey, hey, there's a woman in the world
that you can't use

471
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:11,790
Ain't no love, Ain't no use
Ain't no love

472
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:17,504
Yeah, well, my first choice was
to work at a boutique on Rodeo Drive,
but this would be okay.

473
00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:21,883
Well, thank you. Unfortunately, we
don't have any openings here right now.

474
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:23,885
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

475
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:28,432
Although we might have
an opening at our discount outlet.

476
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:31,685
Okay, well, what street
would that be on?

477
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:58,795
Come on, Michele. At this point,
any job is better than no job at all.

478
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,631
A discount outlet? Me?

479
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,802
Fine.

480
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:08,513
So, any boyfriends yet?

481
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:14,102
No. All the guys with good jobs
must be going to some other club.

482
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:18,106
Oh, you know where Dana met her new
boyfriend? He's a William Morris agent.

483
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:22,027
Oh! Showbiz!
Good job! Where?

484
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:26,990
Hi. My name is Romy,
and I'm an alcoholic.

485
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:31,078
- Hi, Romy!
- Hey.

486
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:34,790
And you also get a five-percent
employee discount...

487
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:37,501
over and above our
everyday low prices.

488
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:41,380
You could make curtains
for the motorhome with this.

489
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:45,717
- I got this tie for a dollar.
- You paid a whole dollar for that?

490
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:48,637
- You betcha.
- Ah!

491
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,687
She's one
of our regulars.

492
00:32:58,689 --> 00:33:02,734
So, what do you think?

493
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:05,696
I-l'd like to go away.

494
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,460
I know I'm supposed to wait
in that line, but listen.

495
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:24,548
I wouldn't even be here if this
weren't, like, a dating emergency.

496
00:33:24,673 --> 00:33:29,011
Our cutoff is 25.
Try VH-1.

497
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:53,577
The reunion's less than a week
away. I mean, I just can't
believe you turned down a job.

498
00:33:53,702 --> 00:33:56,246
Well, I thought the idea
was to impress people.

499
00:33:56,371 --> 00:34:01,043
I mean, how am I going
to impress anyone by selling
Ban-Lon smocks at Bargain Mart?

500
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:07,758
I'm sick of this.
I'm gonna go weigh myself.

501
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:25,359
Oh, God! I've been killing myself
for eight days and I gained a pound.

502
00:34:25,484 --> 00:34:29,988
That's impossible! Did you
deduct 16 pounds for your shoes?

503
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:33,367
Just forget it.
I'm not going.

504
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:37,371
- What?
- Come on. Get real, Michele.
We're idiots.

505
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:42,668
We can't get jobs and boyfriends,
and lose weight, in two weeks.

506
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:45,379
But I thought
you said we could.

507
00:35:11,071 --> 00:35:15,409
Wow. God, the top female
executives are all so pretty.

508
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,331
Those aren't the actual executives,
Michele. Those are models.

509
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:24,126
Oh, I thought
they looked familiar.

510
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:27,546
God, they really look like
executives, don't they?

511
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:29,715
That's only because they're
wearing those stupid suits...

512
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,759
and phoney glasses,
and carrying briefcases.

513
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:38,348
- Huh!
- Oh, my God, Michele, that's it!

514
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:41,518
We can go to the reunion, and
just pretend to be successful!

515
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:43,895
I mean, who's gonna know?
They're in Tucson, we're here.

516
00:35:44,021 --> 00:35:46,481
We could just show up
looking like businesswomen.

517
00:35:46,606 --> 00:35:49,860
Oh, my God!
Oh!

518
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:54,031
Wait. Ohh. But if the people at the
reunion see us drive up in a Nova...

519
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:56,950
won't they know we're not
really businesswomen?

520
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:59,703
If you can make us
the clothes...

521
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:02,789
I can get us the car.

522
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:19,806
Clear out, boys.
I need to talk to Ramon.

523
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:21,808
Go!

524
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:28,899
Yes, cara mia?

525
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:32,486
Michele and I have this
high school reunion to go to...

526
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:35,364
and we need to show up
in a really cool car.

527
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:38,533
- Yeah?
- Todd told me that he gave
you a really great deal...

528
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:44,247
- on an XJS convertible and
that you're fixing it up.
- Yeah?

529
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:47,959
So...

530
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,754
can I borrow your car?

531
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:53,548
Well, if I loan
you my car...

532
00:36:53,674 --> 00:36:56,426
what do I get?

533
00:36:56,551 --> 00:37:00,430
- Uh, what do you want?
- Ohh, Romy...

534
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:02,599
you know what I want.

535
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:06,770
Oh, forget it. I'm not going
to have sex with you
just to borrow your stupid car!

536
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:09,064
I gotta get something.

537
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:13,944
Okay.

538
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:19,574
Close the blinds,
and we'll work something out.

539
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:25,288
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh, Ramon!

540
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:28,542
- Ohh, Ramon, ohh! Ohh!
- Check this out.

541
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:31,545
- Oh, yes. Ohh.
- Oh, yeah.

542
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,964
- Oh, man!
- Ohh! Ohh!

543
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:36,883
Ohh, Ramon!
Ohh, Ramon!

544
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:39,803
Ohh! Oh, yes.

545
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:44,141
You are Columbus,
and I am America.

546
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:47,811
Discover me, Ramon!
Just discover me.

547
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:51,606
Hey, uh-- Explosions.
The earth is moving.

548
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:56,403
Explosions!
The earth is moving!

549
00:37:56,528 --> 00:38:00,949
Ah, ooh-- is that an earthquake?
No, it's Ramon.

550
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:06,163
Is that an earthquake?
No, it's Ramon!

551
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:08,540
Ahh! It's Ramon!

552
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:12,836
Man stallion, fill me
with your giant love wand!

553
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:15,047
What? No, I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

554
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:18,550
Well, say something nice
about my penis!

555
00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:22,054
Oh, Ramon, your penis
is so powerful. I'm coming!

556
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:26,016
- Okay, thanks. Get off me now.
- Aw, come on, wh--

557
00:38:26,141 --> 00:38:28,685
- You wanted it to be believable.
- Aww.

558
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,773
I'm just a girl
in the world

559
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:37,527
That's all that
you'll let me be

560
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:42,282
Oh, I'm just a girl
living in captivity

561
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:47,746
Oh, my God!
You did it!

562
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:52,668
Yeah, I did.
All right, let's get going.

563
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:56,296
Oh, this is gonna
be so much fun.

564
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:58,757
- So, what'd you have to do to get it?
- I had to give all the guys...

565
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:01,885
in the service department
hand jobs.

566
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:05,055
Well, while you were doing that,
I taped all the nostalgic songs...

567
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,642
from high school,
to get us in the mood.

568
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:11,561
- Michele?
- Huh?
- I was kidding.

569
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:15,899
- What?
- You actually think I would
do something like that?

570
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:19,569
For a car?

571
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,447
- Okay, just get in.
- Okay.

572
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:31,081
Hey, look what else
I got us, little lady.

573
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:33,917
- Oh, my God. It's a flip phone!
- Uh-huh.

574
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:36,086
- How'd you get this?
- I bought it.

575
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:42,968
Okay.

576
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:51,226
- Are ya ready?
- Ready.

577
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:53,895
Let's do it.

578
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:55,897
Tonight
I gotta cut loose

579
00:39:56,023 --> 00:39:57,899
- Footloose
- Footloose!
- Footloose!

580
00:39:58,025 --> 00:40:00,485
- Kick off my Sunday shoes
- Kick off my Sunday knees?

581
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,406
- Oowhee, Louise
- I have no idea what
the rest of the lyrics are.

582
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:07,492
- Me neither. Whoo!
- Jack, get back

583
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:10,662
- Watch out, Tucson, here we come!
- Come on before we crack

584
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:14,916
- Shit!
- Aww.

585
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:25,469
- Loose your blues
- Watch out, Tucson, here we come!
- Everybody cut footloose

586
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:29,306
Footloose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes

587
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:31,391
- Shit!
- Aww.

588
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:37,314
- Footloose
- Whoo!

589
00:40:40,317 --> 00:40:43,070
- You're playin' so cool
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

590
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:45,656
Obeyin' every rule

591
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:48,408
- Dig way down in your heart
- Down in your art--

592
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,827
- You're yearnin', burnin'
- You're flurnin', burnin', earnin'

593
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:53,997
- Somebody to tell you
- Somebody better tell you

594
00:40:54,122 --> 00:40:57,501
- That life ain't passin' you by
- You have one hell of an eye

595
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:01,880
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

596
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:04,591
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

597
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:06,760
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

598
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:09,346
- Everybody, everybody cut footloose
- Footloose

599
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:25,487
I got your picture
I got your picture

600
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:28,073
I'd like a million of ya
all to myself

601
00:41:28,198 --> 00:41:30,742
I want a doctor
to take a picture

602
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:33,412
So I can look at you
from inside as well

603
00:41:33,537 --> 00:41:37,416
- You got me turning up and turning down
- Okay, I give up. What are you doing?

604
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,876
Pass this car.
This kid is so obnoxious.

605
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,631
- Turning Japanese
- Oh, my God. What is with that kid?

606
00:41:44,756 --> 00:41:47,217
I don't know.
He is sick!

607
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:52,764
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

608
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:57,728
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

609
00:41:57,853 --> 00:42:00,564
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

610
00:42:00,689 --> 00:42:03,191
Oh, I'm sorry. No.

611
00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:06,403
No, not you. No. I was trying
to scare your little boy.

612
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:12,659
Oh, my God.
Are my lips that big?

613
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:19,291
Woke up this mornin'
happy as can be

614
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:21,626
- Some more of that?
- Yeah.

615
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:24,254
All right. Now, just remember,
from this point on...

616
00:42:24,379 --> 00:42:28,175
we are sophisticated, educated,
successful career women.

617
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,095
Right. Okay.

618
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,016
God, this underwear is totally
riding up my butt crack.

619
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:42,481
Yeah. Hello.
Um, we need something to go.

620
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:47,527
- Okay.
- Do you have some sort of
businesswoman's special?

621
00:42:49,154 --> 00:42:51,323
- Come again?
- Well, we're businesswomen.

622
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:56,078
- Yeah. From L.A.
- And you know some places have,
like, a lunch special.

623
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:59,039
For businesswomen.

624
00:42:59,164 --> 00:43:02,417
We don't have
anything like that.

625
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:06,171
Well, then why don't you
just give us, um, two burgers
and fries and Diet Cokes...

626
00:43:06,296 --> 00:43:09,716
- 'cause we're in a hurry.
- Mm. We're due in Tucson later.

627
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:13,804
For a business thing.
You know.

628
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:15,931
What kind
of business you in?

629
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:29,277
I can't believe we never thought
of what to say we did for a living.

630
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:32,072
Oh. Which one
of these guys...

631
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:34,950
will I have sex with
at the reunion?

632
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,370
Ooh!
Casey Degan!

633
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:41,581
- Aaah!
- Come on! Now, we're
running out of time.

634
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:48,171
I know. Why don't we say
that we own our own company?

635
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:50,716
Ooh, good.
Like what?

636
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:54,594
- Like, what if we invented something?
- Like what?

637
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,057
Well, okay, l-l think it should
be like something that-that
everybody has heard about...

638
00:43:59,182 --> 00:44:02,269
but-but nobody really
knows who invented it.

639
00:44:02,394 --> 00:44:04,563
Oh, my God! I've got it!
Post-lts!

640
00:44:04,688 --> 00:44:07,941
- Everybody knows what Post-lts are!
- Yeah!

641
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:11,278
They're the little yellow things
with the stickum on the back, right?

642
00:44:11,403 --> 00:44:13,405
Okay.

643
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:16,408
Okay, we're-we're working in this
advertising agency after college.

644
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:18,618
- Ooh, college! Good one!
- Yeah.

645
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:21,955
And we have, like, this big,
like, presentation...

646
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,957
to make to,
like, a client.

647
00:44:24,082 --> 00:44:26,877
- Hmm!
- So-so-so we're, like, brainstorming...

648
00:44:27,002 --> 00:44:29,629
and all of the sudden
we're out of paper clips!

649
00:44:29,755 --> 00:44:33,133
- Good!
- And so, okay-- So then l, l, like--

650
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:35,469
Okay, I say--
I say-- Okay--

651
00:44:35,594 --> 00:44:38,889
"Wouldn't it be great if there
was, like, this, like, stickum
on the back of this paper...

652
00:44:39,014 --> 00:44:43,018
"so, like, it-it would just--
if I laid it on top of that
other paper it would just stay...

653
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:45,020
you know, like,
without a paper clip?"

654
00:44:45,145 --> 00:44:46,772
- Yes!
- Ahh!

655
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:49,107
So then you've got, like, this
grandfather or this uncle...

656
00:44:49,232 --> 00:44:51,860
that, like, has, like, a-- Iike a--
Iike a paper company or a paper mill...

657
00:44:51,985 --> 00:44:54,988
and-and he's, like, really into it,
and the rest is history!

658
00:44:55,113 --> 00:44:57,491
Oh, my God!
It is perfect!

659
00:44:57,616 --> 00:45:00,702
Wow!
Don't you think?

660
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:03,664
Well, yeah, but--

661
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:06,792
- "Well, yeah, but" what?
- I don't know.

662
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,045
I mean, it just sounds like you invented
Post-lts all by yourself, you know.

663
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,674
-I mean, what did I do?
-Well, it was your grandfather or uncle.

664
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:16,677
Yeah?

665
00:45:16,802 --> 00:45:19,680
Okay, you know,
so we could say that...

666
00:45:19,805 --> 00:45:21,682
you were,
like, the designer.

667
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:25,018
Like, I thought of them, but you
thought of making them yellow.

668
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,690
Well, no, but it's like
most of these people...

669
00:45:29,815 --> 00:45:32,192
have, like, known us
since elementary school.

670
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:35,195
I just think that you're
more believable as a designer...

671
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,991
rather than
as an inventor, you know?

672
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:41,868
- Uh-huh.
- You're my lover

673
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:45,330
Not my rival

674
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,332
- What are you doing?
- Look.

675
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,335
You're obviously
pissed at me.

676
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,337
No. Uh-uh. Why should
I be pissed at you?

677
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:54,548
Just because now I know
how you really feel about me.

678
00:45:54,673 --> 00:45:56,508
Oh, my God,
I knew this would happen.

679
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:59,845
I mean, I try, for once,
to be honest with you...

680
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,847
and it blows up
in my face.

681
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:09,980
God!
You wanna be honest?

682
00:46:10,105 --> 00:46:12,983
Okay, good!
Let's be honest!

683
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:16,236
I let you
have the ideas!

684
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:18,405
- What?
- Yeah, I let you have the ideas...

685
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,033
so you won't feel so bad
that I'm cuter.

686
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:24,911
- You are not cuter, Michele.
- I am so cuter.

687
00:46:25,037 --> 00:46:27,539
It's, like, common knowledge, Romy.
Everybody thinks so.

688
00:46:27,664 --> 00:46:30,208
I'm the Mary
and you're the Rhoda.

689
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,794
That's ridiculous. You're the Rhoda.
You're the Jewish one.

690
00:46:32,919 --> 00:46:35,797
Oh, my God. I'm talking
cuteness-wise, Romy, okay?

691
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:38,091
And cuteness-wise,
I'm the Mary.

692
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:42,596
That's crazy! You have absolutely
no proof that you're cuter!

693
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:45,223
Oh, proof? You want proof?
Okay, fine.

694
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:47,893
- Who lost their virginity first?
- Oh, big wow!

695
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:51,104
With your cousin Barry.
I wouldn't brag about it.

696
00:46:51,229 --> 00:46:55,776
Okay, so who always gets asked to
dance first when we go to clubs, huh?

697
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:58,320
No wonder you couldn't
find us boyfriends, Romy.

698
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:05,869
Well, so what?
You can't even get a job!

699
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:09,956
- I carry you, Michele!
Without me, you'd be lost!
- That is such a lie!

700
00:47:10,082 --> 00:47:12,959
Oh, yeah? Well, let's just see.
Let's split up and see what happens.

701
00:47:13,085 --> 00:47:15,170
W-What do you mean,
split up?

702
00:47:15,295 --> 00:47:19,132
When we get to Tucson,
we're going our own separate ways.

703
00:47:19,257 --> 00:47:21,176
Okay. Good.

704
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:23,178
Fine.
I don't care.

705
00:47:23,303 --> 00:47:25,013
- Fine!
- Fine.

706
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:27,307
As of Tucson,
we're finished.

707
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:30,602
Well, drive fast!

708
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:26,992
Always something there
to remind me

709
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:43,133
Wow.
Billy Christianson?

710
00:48:45,302 --> 00:48:47,637
Romy. Romy White.

711
00:48:47,763 --> 00:48:51,224
No. No way.

712
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,602
My God, you--
you look fantastic.

713
00:48:53,727 --> 00:48:57,564
I mean, l-- I never would have
recognized you in a million years.

714
00:48:57,689 --> 00:49:00,025
Thanks.

715
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,779
So, what have you been doin'
since high school?

716
00:49:03,904 --> 00:49:07,282
Well,
believe it or not...

717
00:49:07,407 --> 00:49:09,618
I invented Post-lts.

718
00:49:20,796 --> 00:49:22,339
So I told Prescott...

719
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:25,926
"You can either pay me the 150
or I am out of here. Bye-bye."

720
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:30,263
I mean, there are at least 12
other major markets that would
put me on the air tomorrow.

721
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:33,392
Wow. So you did it?
You're an anchorwoman?

722
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:37,270
No.
I'm a weather girl.

723
00:49:37,396 --> 00:49:39,815
On the highest-rated
5:00 news in Tucson.

724
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,775
- Oh.
- So...

725
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,612
Michele,
what are you up to?

726
00:49:45,737 --> 00:49:49,282
Uh, okay.
Um, I invented Post-lts.

727
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:52,119
- You're kidding!
- You must've made a fortune!

728
00:49:52,244 --> 00:49:54,287
Well, yeah.

729
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:56,289
No offence, Michele...

730
00:49:56,415 --> 00:49:59,501
but how in the world
did you think of Post-lts?

731
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,589
Um... well...

732
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:06,591
uh...

733
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:11,346
And I invented them
totally by myself.

734
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:15,434
I mean, all Michele did was say,
"What about making them yellow?"

735
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,437
Really?

736
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:29,990
- Actually, I invented
a special kind of glue.
- Oh, really?

737
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:32,826
Well, then I'm sure you wouldn't
mind giving us a detailed account...

738
00:50:32,951 --> 00:50:37,164
of exactly how you concocted
this miracle glue, would you?

739
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:41,335
No. Um--

740
00:50:42,502 --> 00:50:45,339
Well, ordinarily
when you make glue...

741
00:50:45,464 --> 00:50:48,800
first you need to
thermoset your resin...

742
00:50:48,925 --> 00:50:53,180
and then after it cools
you mix in a, um, epoxide.

743
00:50:53,305 --> 00:50:55,599
Which is really just
a fancy-schmancy name...

744
00:50:55,724 --> 00:50:59,019
for any simple,
oxygenated adhesive, right?

745
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:03,231
But then I thought maybe-- just maybe--
you could raise the viscosity...

746
00:51:03,357 --> 00:51:07,402
by adding a complex glucose derivative
during the emulsification process.

747
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:10,530
And it turns out,
I was right.

748
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:14,701
Huh?
I don't believe it.

749
00:51:14,826 --> 00:51:18,330
You must be the most successful
person in our graduating class.

750
00:51:18,455 --> 00:51:21,375
Uh-huh.
And you're not. Bye.

751
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,878
Always something there
to remind me

752
00:51:34,513 --> 00:51:36,390
This is so great.

753
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:41,061
Romy?

754
00:51:43,021 --> 00:51:44,898
Can I ask you
something?

755
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:50,696
Romy! You will not believe
what just happened!

756
00:51:50,821 --> 00:51:53,240
Michele, can't you see
that I am busy?

757
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:56,785
Fine.
Okay, just forget it.

758
00:52:02,582 --> 00:52:05,293
Whoa! Oh. Oww.

759
00:52:05,419 --> 00:52:07,796
Oww. Oww. Oww.

760
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:09,381
Oh!

761
00:52:09,506 --> 00:52:12,092
Oh! Come on!

762
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:16,138
Oh, God!
Are you all right?

763
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:18,890
- What do you think?
- I am so sorry.

764
00:52:19,016 --> 00:52:21,893
My-My-My driver
didn't see you.

765
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:25,147
Please. Come.

766
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:28,984
I have boxes of Kleenex
in my limo.

767
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:30,986
Let me make it up
to you.

768
00:52:34,072 --> 00:52:35,449
Okay.

769
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:48,337
Oh, my God.

770
00:52:48,462 --> 00:52:51,965
- Here. Help yourself, Michele.
- Thanks.

771
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,301
Wait. How do you
know my name?

772
00:52:54,426 --> 00:52:57,637
It's me, Michele.
Sandy.

773
00:52:57,763 --> 00:53:00,599
- Sandy Frink?
- Uh-huh.

774
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:03,143
But you're so dreamy.

775
00:53:03,268 --> 00:53:05,145
Well, when I made
my first million...

776
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,357
my present to myself
was a new face.

777
00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:10,359
Okay, I'm not
just saying this...

778
00:53:10,484 --> 00:53:12,694
but you really picked
a good one.

779
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:14,821
Thanks.

780
00:53:16,365 --> 00:53:18,492
I had this notebook...

781
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:22,788
with "Mrs Romy Christianson" written
on it, like, about a thousand times.

782
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:27,793
Now you think
I'm some sort of geek.

783
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:31,880
No. No.

784
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:35,133
No, not at all.

785
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:38,845
I'm flattered.

786
00:53:41,807 --> 00:53:44,184
Hi, Billy.

787
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:46,812
I've been lookin'
all over for you.

788
00:53:47,646 --> 00:53:49,523
You wanna dance once?

789
00:53:49,648 --> 00:53:52,526
You know,
for old times' sake.

790
00:53:59,992 --> 00:54:02,327
No, thanks.

791
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:06,873
I owe this one to Romy.

792
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:36,987
Hey, you guys, they're about
to announce the winners of the vote.

793
00:54:37,112 --> 00:54:40,198
- Come on!
- Vote? What vote?

794
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:44,161
- Let's go. We gotta get in there.
- Okay.

795
00:54:47,956 --> 00:54:50,417
Wait, I can't
find my top.

796
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:54,046
Where are you?

797
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:08,060
Hey, how you guys
doin' tonight?

798
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:12,439
I bet, uh, everyone
is as anxious...

799
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:15,067
as I am to hear
the results of the vote.

800
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:16,985
What vote?

801
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:21,907
The person voted Most Changed
for the Better Since High School is--

802
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:27,412
It's a tie.
It's a tie.

803
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:30,791
The Most Changed for the Better
Since High School are...

804
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:35,087
Romy White
and Michele Weinberger.

805
00:55:40,425 --> 00:55:44,805
Honey, go on up there
and get your medal.

806
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,807
Okay.

807
00:55:46,932 --> 00:55:50,310
How weird. I didn't
even know we were voting.

808
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:14,042
Get me another daiquiri.

809
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:24,678
Here you go.

810
00:56:26,304 --> 00:56:30,475
Um, I'm sorry.
I couldn't find my top.

811
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:38,191
Honey,
that is beautiful.

812
00:58:06,446 --> 00:58:08,490
May I take that
for you, sir?

813
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:12,452
No, no, no.
You leave me alone.

814
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:22,462
Looking at your medal
from the reunion again, dear?

815
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:27,592
You miss her,
don't you?

816
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:30,595
Duh.

817
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,306
Michele...

818
00:58:35,976 --> 00:58:41,064
have you been terribly unhappy
with me all these years?

819
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:43,483
Oh, no.
No, Sandy.

820
00:58:43,608 --> 00:58:45,444
Oh, good.

821
00:58:45,569 --> 00:58:49,156
I've just been lonely
with no one to talk to.

822
00:58:51,992 --> 00:58:54,286
Why don't you call her?

823
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:57,539
- Okay.
- Yeah.

824
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:07,341
- Hello?
- Billy Christianson?

825
00:59:07,466 --> 00:59:10,719
Oh, no, no,
I'm-l'm Billy Junior.

826
00:59:10,844 --> 00:59:15,182
Oh, Billy, honey,
is your mommy home?

827
00:59:15,307 --> 00:59:17,100
Well, yeah.

828
00:59:17,225 --> 00:59:20,812
Yeah, but, uh, she can't come
to the phone right now.

829
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:22,814
She-She's on
her deathbed.

830
00:59:22,939 --> 00:59:25,192
- Romy.
- Oh, dear.

831
00:59:25,317 --> 00:59:27,361
Billy, honey...

832
00:59:27,486 --> 00:59:32,366
tell your mommy that
Michele Weinberger-Frink...

833
00:59:32,491 --> 00:59:34,368
is on the phone...

834
00:59:34,493 --> 00:59:38,622
and would very much
like to speak with her.

835
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:47,381
No.

836
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:49,508
Not until you admit...

837
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:53,053
that I'm the Mary,
and you're the Rhoda.

838
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:56,723
I'm the Mary.

839
00:59:56,848 --> 00:59:58,725
I'm the Mary!

840
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:04,022
I'm the-- You're a pasty hag
on a deathbed.

841
01:00:05,148 --> 01:00:09,236
I'm the Mary.
Everybody knows.

842
01:00:09,361 --> 01:00:11,697
Way to go, honey.

843
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:26,086
Oh, God.

844
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:28,088
Oh, we're really here.

845
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:32,718
- Oh, God.
- Good evening, sir.

846
01:00:32,843 --> 01:00:34,928
Thanks for not
waking me up, Romy.

847
01:00:35,053 --> 01:00:37,431
God, what a bitch.

848
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:00,245
Don't get me wrong

849
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:04,750
If I'm looking
kind of dazzled

850
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:10,756
I see neon lights

851
01:01:11,882 --> 01:01:14,760
Whenever you walk by

852
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:18,764
Don't get me wrong

853
01:01:20,098 --> 01:01:23,226
- Hey, Romy White.
- Hey.

854
01:01:23,352 --> 01:01:27,314
- Where's Michele?
- I don't know.

855
01:01:27,439 --> 01:01:29,775
Um, anybody see
Billy Christianson?

856
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,653
- Try the bar.
- Thanks, man.

857
01:01:35,322 --> 01:01:38,950
Don't get me wrong

858
01:01:39,076 --> 01:01:42,788
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
You-you can't go in without a name tag.

859
01:01:42,913 --> 01:01:44,831
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

860
01:01:44,956 --> 01:01:46,917
Uh, Michele Weinberger.

861
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:51,630
Oh, my God, Michele Weinberger!
My God, you look great!

862
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:55,175
It's me, Toby.
Oh, Toby Walters.

863
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,678
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

864
01:01:57,803 --> 01:01:59,971
Um, oh, here it is.
Here is your name tag.

865
01:02:00,097 --> 01:02:02,349
And, um, Romy
is already inside.

866
01:02:02,474 --> 01:02:06,144
- I could care less.
I am not here with Romy.
- You're kidding me.

867
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:08,522
No, we're not
even friends any more.

868
01:02:08,647 --> 01:02:11,692
We had this big falling out
over Post-lts.

869
01:02:12,901 --> 01:02:14,903
- Post-lts?
- It's a long story.

870
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:16,905
- See ya.
- W-W--

871
01:02:22,327 --> 01:02:25,205
I'm only off to wander

872
01:02:27,332 --> 01:02:30,210
Across a moonlit night

873
01:02:33,171 --> 01:02:35,674
Once in a while

874
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:37,843
Two people meet

875
01:02:37,968 --> 01:02:42,014
Seemingly, for no reason
they just pass on the street

876
01:02:42,139 --> 01:02:47,185
Suddenly thundershowers
everywhere

877
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:49,354
Who can explain
the thunder and rain

878
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:51,565
But there's somethin'
in the air

879
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:54,067
Ooh, excuse me.

880
01:02:54,192 --> 01:02:56,111
Hi, Romy.
How are you?

881
01:02:56,236 --> 01:02:59,406
- Lisa Luder?
- Yes.

882
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:03,452
So, where's the rest
of the "A" group?

883
01:03:03,577 --> 01:03:05,954
Oh, they're around here
someplace.

884
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,206
We sort of lost touch
over the years.

885
01:03:08,332 --> 01:03:12,377
Wow. Isn't it weird when you're
not friends with your friends any more?

886
01:03:12,502 --> 01:03:17,299
I mean, Michele and I just fell
out of touch about two hours ago.

887
01:03:17,424 --> 01:03:19,301
Because she's selfish...

888
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:21,720
and she always,
like, devalues me.

889
01:03:21,845 --> 01:03:23,722
And I'm sick of it,
you know?

890
01:03:27,893 --> 01:03:30,437
God, you guys are easy
to talk to.

891
01:03:30,562 --> 01:03:32,439
I invented Post-lts.

892
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:38,612
- You know, the yellow things
with the stickum on the back?
- Yes, I know what they are.

893
01:03:38,737 --> 01:03:41,490
So, uh,
what are you up to?

894
01:03:41,615 --> 01:03:45,661
I'm an associate fashion editor
for Vogue.

895
01:03:45,786 --> 01:03:49,081
Wow! Wh--
Good job!

896
01:03:49,206 --> 01:03:52,459
Boy, I must have, like,
every single issue of Vogue...

897
01:03:52,584 --> 01:03:55,712
for the past ten years.

898
01:03:55,837 --> 01:03:59,007
Okay, well, it was
very nice talking with you.

899
01:03:59,132 --> 01:04:01,301
Nice talking to you too.

900
01:04:02,928 --> 01:04:05,806
Okay, Romy.

901
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:08,767
It might just be
fantastic

902
01:04:10,394 --> 01:04:12,813
Don't get me wrong

903
01:04:22,656 --> 01:04:24,533
It was so cute.

904
01:04:24,658 --> 01:04:27,035
My mom gave us
a new car seat for the baby.

905
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,163
And when the box arrived, little
Jake looks up at me and says...

906
01:04:30,288 --> 01:04:32,374
"Mommy,
is that the baby?"

907
01:04:32,499 --> 01:04:35,627
- Oh.
- I wish.

908
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:37,921
Hey, everyone.

909
01:04:38,046 --> 01:04:40,924
- And so we meet again.
- Oh, hi.

910
01:04:42,092 --> 01:04:43,301
Romy White.

911
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:46,680
You're the chubby girl.

912
01:04:46,805 --> 01:04:51,310
Oh, well, I was, but I haven't
been for a really long time.

913
01:04:51,435 --> 01:04:53,979
So, what are
all of you up to?

914
01:04:54,104 --> 01:04:56,982
Christie, in the yearbook you said
that you wanted Jane Pauley's job.

915
01:04:57,107 --> 01:05:00,068
Are you a big TV news
anchorwoman now?

916
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:03,697
Oh, no, I don't even
watch TV any more.

917
01:05:03,822 --> 01:05:07,534
My priorities have changed
since I became a mommy.

918
01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:10,162
Can you believe
this is number three?

919
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:12,664
Wow, three kids.

920
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:14,916
God, you must feel
really tied down.

921
01:05:16,668 --> 01:05:20,047
Not at all.
I feel very fulfilled.

922
01:05:20,172 --> 01:05:24,051
Besides, Billy always
wanted a big family.

923
01:05:26,678 --> 01:05:29,556
- Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

924
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:32,726
- You married Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

925
01:05:32,851 --> 01:05:35,479
For almost ten years now.

926
01:05:35,604 --> 01:05:38,357
Billy's in
real estate development.

927
01:05:40,859 --> 01:05:43,236
So, how about you?
Any kids?

928
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:45,947
Oh, uh, no.

929
01:05:46,073 --> 01:05:49,910
I just haven't had time, you know, what
with running my own business and all.

930
01:05:50,035 --> 01:05:51,912
Your own business?

931
01:05:52,037 --> 01:05:55,624
Yeah.
I invented Post-lts.

932
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,086
No, really.
What do you do?

933
01:06:00,295 --> 01:06:04,800
That's what I do.
I invented Post-lts.

934
01:06:04,925 --> 01:06:07,969
Oh. You're kidding me.

935
01:06:10,722 --> 01:06:12,891
Well, I've made
a lot of money.

936
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:16,061
Oh, you know who they say
has made a ton of money? Sandy Frink.

937
01:06:16,186 --> 01:06:18,063
- The Frink-a-zoid?
- Yeah.

938
01:06:18,188 --> 01:06:21,900
He invented some special kind
of rubber that's used in every
tennis shoe in North America.

939
01:06:22,025 --> 01:06:24,611
Hey, if anybody
needs to make a call...

940
01:06:24,736 --> 01:06:27,280
I've got a phone.

941
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:46,633
- Is Sandy Frink here?
- Uh, no.

942
01:06:46,758 --> 01:06:49,636
-Uh, you can't go in without a name tag.
-Fuck off!

943
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:54,099
Heather Mooney? Oh, my God,
you're exactly the same.

944
01:06:54,224 --> 01:06:56,768
Oh, my God.
Heather Mooney is here?

945
01:06:59,646 --> 01:07:01,982
This ought to be so good.

946
01:07:05,319 --> 01:07:07,779
Oh, God, don't look now.
It's Heather Mooney.

947
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:10,657
- What?
- Hello, Romy.

948
01:07:10,782 --> 01:07:13,285
Uh-- E-- Uh-- You--

949
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:16,997
Oh, uh-- Heather,
you said you weren't coming.

950
01:07:17,122 --> 01:07:20,667
Yeah, well, since Sandy
and Michele aren't married--

951
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,170
What a waste
of a tank of gas, huh?

952
01:07:24,755 --> 01:07:26,757
Okay, well, come on.
I'll help you go find him.

953
01:07:26,882 --> 01:07:30,344
Uh, he's not here. I already asked Toby
Dumbfuck. Obviously, I've interrupted.

954
01:07:30,469 --> 01:07:33,388
Why don't you just go back to ignoring
me like you did in high school?

955
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:35,390
No, you can stay.

956
01:07:35,515 --> 01:07:39,811
We're just discussing our class
success stories. So, what are you up to?

957
01:07:39,936 --> 01:07:42,898
Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?
I invented the quick-burning paper.

958
01:07:43,023 --> 01:07:46,318
- Wow, we have a whole class
full of inventors.
- Meaning?

959
01:07:46,443 --> 01:07:48,320
Oh, you know, Sandy Frink
invented something too.

960
01:07:48,445 --> 01:07:51,323
- Hey, isn't that Sandy over there now?
- What did Sandy invent?

961
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:55,994
- Some kind of rubber.
- Romy here invented Post-lts.
- You did not.

962
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:57,162
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

963
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:58,246
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

964
01:07:58,372 --> 01:07:59,665
Yeah, l--
Well, who did then?

965
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:02,000
A guy named Art Fry
from the 3M Corp.

966
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,586
We studied it
in business school.

967
01:08:07,673 --> 01:08:09,049
You're kidding me.

968
01:08:09,174 --> 01:08:11,885
You just
made all that up?

969
01:08:25,357 --> 01:08:28,026
Oh, God,
you are so weird.

970
01:08:29,653 --> 01:08:31,780
- Why don't you just leave her alone?
- Michele.

971
01:08:31,905 --> 01:08:35,075
Oh, it's
the back brace girl.

972
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,911
- Hi, back brace girl.
- Hi, back brace girl.

973
01:08:38,036 --> 01:08:40,914
Oh, shut up.

974
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,083
And what are you
picking on us for anyway?

975
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:45,585
We are not the ones
who got fat.

976
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:48,588
We're pregnant,
you half-wit.

977
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:51,591
Oh, yeah, well...

978
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:54,886
I hope your babies
look like monkeys.

979
01:08:55,012 --> 01:08:56,930
Come on, Romy.

980
01:09:08,358 --> 01:09:13,071
- Oh, Romy.
- Oh, please, go away.
Just leave me alone.

981
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:17,284
Why did I even
come back here?

982
01:09:17,409 --> 01:09:20,078
Well, you know what? There are worse
things than telling some dumb story...

983
01:09:20,203 --> 01:09:22,164
and having everybody
laugh at you.

984
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:27,794
- Like what?
- Like losing your best friend.

985
01:09:27,919 --> 01:09:29,796
You know? I mean,
I had the worst dream, Romy.

986
01:09:29,921 --> 01:09:34,217
I dreamt that we weren't friends
and we were really, really old.

987
01:09:34,343 --> 01:09:37,012
But I mean, like, we were, like,
really, really old.

988
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:39,181
And-And we weren't friends.

989
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:44,478
I can't stand that
we're mad at each other.

990
01:09:44,603 --> 01:09:47,564
Okay, I'm sorry
I said all those things.

991
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:50,525
You're as cute as me.
You are.

992
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:54,446
And-And in some cultures,
maybe cuter.

993
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:56,990
I'm sorry too.

994
01:09:57,115 --> 01:10:01,286
I shouldn't have said that you weren't
smart enough to invent Post-lts.

995
01:10:01,411 --> 01:10:04,289
Well, I mean,
maybe I'm not.

996
01:10:04,414 --> 01:10:08,293
Although in my dream,
I did know the formula for glue.

997
01:10:11,963 --> 01:10:14,299
So, are we friends again?

998
01:10:16,093 --> 01:10:17,969
Well, duh.

999
01:10:20,305 --> 01:10:22,224
Okay.

1000
01:10:22,349 --> 01:10:24,226
And you know what,
it doesn't even matter...

1001
01:10:24,351 --> 01:10:27,562
that we told, like, what,
four people some dumb lie.

1002
01:10:27,688 --> 01:10:30,023
Who cares?

1003
01:10:30,148 --> 01:10:32,818
Hi, everybody.

1004
01:10:32,943 --> 01:10:36,196
Settle down. Hi.

1005
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:39,950
I'm Christie
Masters-Christianson.

1006
01:10:42,619 --> 01:10:45,497
I have been asked
to formally welcome you all...

1007
01:10:45,622 --> 01:10:49,292
to Sagebrush High's
ten-year reunion.

1008
01:10:56,091 --> 01:10:59,469
We have come a long way
in the past ten years.

1009
01:10:59,594 --> 01:11:02,556
Our own Lisa Luder is helping
set the style for the country...

1010
01:11:02,681 --> 01:11:05,309
as a fashion editor
for "Vogue" magazine.

1011
01:11:14,192 --> 01:11:16,820
And Travis McKinney
is in his fifth year...

1012
01:11:16,945 --> 01:11:20,198
as a member of the
Dallas Cowboys football team.

1013
01:11:24,536 --> 01:11:25,412
And...

1014
01:11:25,537 --> 01:11:27,914
Romy and Michele claimed...

1015
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,751
they invented Post-lts.

1016
01:11:51,063 --> 01:11:52,939
All I ever wanted was
for people to think...

1017
01:11:53,065 --> 01:11:54,941
that we were better
than we were in high school.

1018
01:11:55,067 --> 01:11:58,445
And now we're just a stupid joke,
just like we always were.

1019
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,908
No, Romy.

1020
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,911
Can I tell you the truth?

1021
01:12:07,579 --> 01:12:11,041
I never knew that we weren't
that great in high school.

1022
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:13,543
I mean, we always had
so much fun together.

1023
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:15,671
I thought high school
was a blast.

1024
01:12:15,796 --> 01:12:18,965
And until you told me that
our lives weren't good enough...

1025
01:12:19,091 --> 01:12:22,636
I thought everything
since high school was a blast.

1026
01:12:22,761 --> 01:12:25,472
I think we should go back
out there as ourselves...

1027
01:12:25,597 --> 01:12:28,475
and just have fun
like we always do.

1028
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,602
The hell with
everyone else.

1029
01:12:30,727 --> 01:12:33,522
I don't think I can.

1030
01:12:33,647 --> 01:12:36,858
Well, do you think you can
stop being such a baby?

1031
01:12:38,151 --> 01:12:40,028
God, I feel like
I've been, like...

1032
01:12:40,153 --> 01:12:42,030
chasing you all over
this reunion.

1033
01:12:42,155 --> 01:12:44,032
We have come
all this way.

1034
01:12:44,157 --> 01:12:48,829
Now we are going to enjoy ourselves
whether you like it or not.

1035
01:12:48,954 --> 01:12:52,916
God, Michele, I've never seen this side
of your personality before.

1036
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:55,002
You're so bossy
and domineering.

1037
01:12:56,628 --> 01:13:00,716
- I like it.
- Me too.

1038
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,766
She's got it

1039
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:12,769
Yeah, baby
she's got it

1040
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,983
- I don't believe it.
- What?

1041
01:13:18,108 --> 01:13:19,484
They're ba-ack.

1042
01:13:22,154 --> 01:13:23,697
Well, I'm your Venus

1043
01:13:23,822 --> 01:13:25,699
- Nice outfits.
- I'm your fire

1044
01:13:25,824 --> 01:13:28,702
Post-lts must be
really lucrative.

1045
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:38,545
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Oh, yeah, Michele, I am so sure.

1046
01:13:41,131 --> 01:13:43,675
What the hell is
your problem, Christie?

1047
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,178
Why are you always
such a nasty bitch?

1048
01:13:47,888 --> 01:13:50,724
Do you get some kind of sick pleasure
from torturing other people?

1049
01:13:50,849 --> 01:13:54,394
I mean, yeah, okay, so Michele and I
did make up some lame story.

1050
01:13:54,519 --> 01:13:57,230
We only did it because we wanted you
to treat us like human beings.

1051
01:13:57,356 --> 01:13:59,232
But you know what
I finally realized?

1052
01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:02,444
I don't care if you like us
'cause we don't like you.

1053
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:04,446
You're a bad person
with an ugly heart...

1054
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:07,449
and we don't give a flying fuck
what you think.

1055
01:14:13,288 --> 01:14:15,916
- Come on, Michele.
- Okay.

1056
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:18,794
And, yeah.

1057
01:14:18,919 --> 01:14:21,963
It's unbelievable.
They're as deluded about their lives...

1058
01:14:22,089 --> 01:14:24,132
as they are about
those hideous clothes.

1059
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:29,262
Actually, Christie,
they've got nice lines...

1060
01:14:29,388 --> 01:14:31,598
a fun,
frisky use of colour.

1061
01:14:31,723 --> 01:14:36,061
All in all, I'd have to say
they're really not bad.

1062
01:14:45,862 --> 01:14:49,616
Well, we still think
they're ridiculous.

1063
01:14:49,741 --> 01:14:51,618
Don't we, girls?

1064
01:14:57,749 --> 01:15:00,961
Why don't you just let them
think for themselves for once?

1065
01:15:01,086 --> 01:15:03,588
You're just jealous...

1066
01:15:03,714 --> 01:15:09,011
because unlike a certain ball-busting,
dried-up career woman I might mention...

1067
01:15:09,136 --> 01:15:11,513
we're all happily married.

1068
01:15:11,638 --> 01:15:13,807
That's right, Christie.

1069
01:15:13,932 --> 01:15:16,018
Keep telling
yourself that.

1070
01:15:28,322 --> 01:15:31,158
- I do love those outfits.
- Yeah, sure do.

1071
01:15:31,283 --> 01:15:33,201
- Oh, great.
- Thanks.

1072
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:35,329
Michele made them.

1073
01:15:35,454 --> 01:15:39,333
Well, I just sewed them.
We both designed them.

1074
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:42,127
- Fifty-fifty.
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1075
01:15:42,252 --> 01:15:43,962
That's so cool.

1076
01:15:45,589 --> 01:15:47,549
Well, it's been really
terrific seeing all of you.

1077
01:15:47,674 --> 01:15:49,843
- Come on, Michele.
- Oh, okay, bye.

1078
01:15:50,927 --> 01:15:51,803
Hi.

1079
01:15:53,513 --> 01:15:57,851
I am sorry that I blew
your big lie for you.

1080
01:15:57,976 --> 01:16:01,688
Hey, that's okay.
It was better this way anyway.

1081
01:16:01,813 --> 01:16:06,026
It's ironic, isn't it? I really thought
you guys had it made in high school.

1082
01:16:06,151 --> 01:16:07,819
- Us?
- Yes, you.

1083
01:16:07,944 --> 01:16:10,739
With your long hair
and your long legs...

1084
01:16:10,864 --> 01:16:12,991
walkin' on your legs,
flippin' your hair.

1085
01:16:13,116 --> 01:16:15,035
I can't compete with that.
You made Sandy crazy.

1086
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,746
And the whole time
you were makin' my life hell...

1087
01:16:17,871 --> 01:16:20,374
the "A" group was making
your life hell; I didn't know.

1088
01:16:20,499 --> 01:16:25,045
You know what? I bet in high school
everybody made somebody's life hell.

1089
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:29,424
Mm-mmm, not me. Never had the
opportunity to make anyone's life hell.

1090
01:16:29,549 --> 01:16:33,053
You know what? I bet that's not true.
You were really unpleasant.

1091
01:16:33,178 --> 01:16:35,055
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. God.

1092
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,391
Heather?
Oh, I'm off duty.

1093
01:16:37,516 --> 01:16:40,185
Um, since you never
got around to it in high school...

1094
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:42,896
I was wondering
if you could sign my yearbook.

1095
01:16:43,021 --> 01:16:46,149
And, uh, please don't
tell me to fuck off...

1096
01:16:46,274 --> 01:16:48,235
because it really hurts
my feelings.

1097
01:16:49,611 --> 01:16:52,781
- I hurt your feelings?
- Yeah, all the time.

1098
01:16:52,906 --> 01:16:55,784
Tremendous!
That's tremendous!

1099
01:16:55,909 --> 01:16:58,453
Go get your stupid yearbook.
I would be happy to sign it.

1100
01:16:58,578 --> 01:17:02,374
Okay, great.
I'll-l'll be right back, okay?

1101
01:17:02,499 --> 01:17:05,335
Michele, I think maybe
we should leave.

1102
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,963
There is no way this reunion
is gonna get any better.

1103
01:17:08,088 --> 01:17:13,135
Hey, everybody, Sandy Frink
just landed in a helicopter!

1104
01:17:14,261 --> 01:17:16,305
Sandy Frink
has a helicopter?

1105
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:18,265
Yeah. Apparently he's worth,
like, millions.

1106
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,935
He invented some kind of
special rubber or something.

1107
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:24,646
Like for condoms?

1108
01:17:29,484 --> 01:17:32,362
Whoa-ohh-ohh

1109
01:17:36,241 --> 01:17:39,619
The hot summer night

1110
01:17:39,745 --> 01:17:42,122
Fell like a net

1111
01:17:43,749 --> 01:17:48,128
I've gotta find
my baby yet

1112
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,966
You think I'm cute

1113
01:17:53,091 --> 01:17:56,345
A little bit shy

1114
01:17:56,470 --> 01:18:01,224
Mama, I ain't
that kind of guy

1115
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:05,854
That's Sandy Frink?
What the hell was I thinking?

1116
01:18:05,979 --> 01:18:07,439
Whoa-ohh-ohh

1117
01:18:12,277 --> 01:18:14,154
Sandy, hi.

1118
01:18:14,279 --> 01:18:16,365
- Doctor, Doctor, give me the news
- You look so rich.

1119
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:20,661
- I got a bad case of lovin' you
- I mean, great.

1120
01:18:20,786 --> 01:18:22,996
No pill's gonna
cure my ill

1121
01:18:23,121 --> 01:18:28,794
I got a bad case
of lovin' you

1122
01:18:30,295 --> 01:18:32,631
Michele.

1123
01:18:32,756 --> 01:18:37,886
- After all these years,
you still take my breath away.
- Thanks.

1124
01:18:38,011 --> 01:18:41,473
So you must be, like,
the most successful person...

1125
01:18:41,598 --> 01:18:43,517
in our entire
graduating class.

1126
01:18:44,977 --> 01:18:48,188
Well, I guess that depends
on how you define "success."

1127
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:52,025
If, to you, success means
having a house in Aspen...

1128
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:55,988
one in Acapulco, a penthouse in
New York, a mansion in Malibu...

1129
01:18:56,113 --> 01:18:58,740
a 60-foot yacht,
an eight-seat Windstar...

1130
01:18:58,865 --> 01:19:01,868
a Bell Jet Ranger, a Bentley,
a personal trainer, a full-time chef...

1131
01:19:01,994 --> 01:19:03,870
a live-in masseuse
and a staff of 24...

1132
01:19:03,996 --> 01:19:06,206
then, yeah...

1133
01:19:06,331 --> 01:19:08,417
I guess I am successful.

1134
01:19:10,168 --> 01:19:13,505
But no matter
how much I accumulate...

1135
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:16,883
there's still one thing
I just don't have.

1136
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:19,720
Your own country?

1137
01:19:21,972 --> 01:19:24,016
I don't have you,
Michele.

1138
01:19:27,811 --> 01:19:29,771
Will you dance with me?

1139
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:35,527
Only if Romy
can dance with us.

1140
01:19:35,652 --> 01:19:37,529
Sure.

1141
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:58,300
Lying in my bed

1142
01:19:58,425 --> 01:20:03,305
I hear the clock tick
and think of you

1143
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:06,308
Caught up in circles

1144
01:20:06,433 --> 01:20:10,437
Confusion is nothing new

1145
01:20:10,562 --> 01:20:14,650
Flashback
Warm nights

1146
01:20:14,775 --> 01:20:17,903
Almost left behind

1147
01:20:18,028 --> 01:20:21,990
Suitcase of memories

1148
01:20:22,115 --> 01:20:26,662
Time after
Sometimes you picture me

1149
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:30,624
I'm walkin'
too far ahead

1150
01:20:30,749 --> 01:20:33,794
You're callin' to me

1151
01:20:33,919 --> 01:20:38,131
I can't hear
what you've said

1152
01:20:38,256 --> 01:20:42,469
Then you say "Go slow"

1153
01:20:42,594 --> 01:20:45,806
I fall behind

1154
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:48,517
The second hand unwinds

1155
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:53,188
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

1156
01:20:53,313 --> 01:20:56,024
Time after time

1157
01:20:56,149 --> 01:21:00,487
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

1158
01:21:00,612 --> 01:21:03,323
Time after time

1159
01:21:03,448 --> 01:21:07,953
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

1160
01:21:08,078 --> 01:21:10,497
Time after time

1161
01:21:10,622 --> 01:21:12,499
If you fall
I will catch you

1162
01:21:12,624 --> 01:21:15,293
- I'll be waiting
- I will be waiting

1163
01:21:15,419 --> 01:21:17,004
Time after time

1164
01:21:19,131 --> 01:21:21,008
Time after time

1165
01:21:22,801 --> 01:21:24,845
Time after time

1166
01:21:26,471 --> 01:21:29,516
Time after time

1167
01:21:29,641 --> 01:21:32,019
Time after time

1168
01:21:33,645 --> 01:21:35,731
See, I told you
it would pay off...

1169
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:38,233
to go to those clubs
every night.

1170
01:21:43,322 --> 01:21:44,531
Come on.

1171
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:51,163
Oh, Jesus,
Mary and Joseph.

1172
01:21:51,288 --> 01:21:53,206
What do you want?

1173
01:21:53,332 --> 01:21:56,877
You were right. I was
a brain-dead, redneck asshole.

1174
01:21:57,002 --> 01:21:59,046
Although I never screwed
a sheep or my sister.

1175
01:21:59,171 --> 01:22:01,340
Why not?
Couldn't catch 'em?

1176
01:22:01,465 --> 01:22:05,552
I guess I deserve that.
I was a jerk.

1177
01:22:07,346 --> 01:22:09,222
But I was so miserable
in high school...

1178
01:22:09,348 --> 01:22:12,351
I don't think I spoke more than
two words the entire time.

1179
01:22:12,476 --> 01:22:16,563
I just couldn't
breathe there, you know?

1180
01:22:16,688 --> 01:22:19,066
Plus, I had this
really bad stutter.

1181
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:24,196
Listen, you, uh,
wanna go somewhere quiet?

1182
01:22:24,321 --> 01:22:26,406
Somewhere
where we can talk?

1183
01:22:26,531 --> 01:22:29,951
- You-You wanna talk to me?
- Yeah.

1184
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,497
Okay, cowboy, I don't know
what your trip is...

1185
01:22:33,622 --> 01:22:36,583
- but if this is some kind
of a sick game--
- What? No.

1186
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:39,419
If you fuck with me
in any way, I will rip...

1187
01:22:39,544 --> 01:22:42,798
each and every appendage from your body,
starting with your dick, capisce?

1188
01:22:44,216 --> 01:22:47,928
Look, I j-just
w-wanted to talk.

1189
01:22:50,889 --> 01:22:52,933
Okay.

1190
01:22:53,058 --> 01:22:54,977
What the hell.

1191
01:22:56,144 --> 01:22:57,521
What is your name?

1192
01:22:57,646 --> 01:22:59,523
- Clarence.
- I like your hat, Clarence.

1193
01:22:59,648 --> 01:23:01,566
- Thank you.
- Pick up the pace.

1194
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,705
You wait here.
I'll prep my chopper.

1195
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,707
- Okay.
- All right.

1196
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:21,378
Oh, my God, somebody's
puking in the bushes.

1197
01:23:21,503 --> 01:23:23,380
Eeewww!

1198
01:23:26,425 --> 01:23:28,635
Hey, how you guys doin'?

1199
01:23:29,553 --> 01:23:30,929
Billy?

1200
01:23:32,097 --> 01:23:35,642
- Chubbo?
- The name is Romy.

1201
01:23:37,352 --> 01:23:39,354
Romy and Michele.

1202
01:23:41,106 --> 01:23:45,610
So, weren't you guys, like,
totally in love with me in high school?

1203
01:23:45,736 --> 01:23:47,863
She was.

1204
01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:56,997
You wanna get a room?

1205
01:23:57,122 --> 01:23:59,458
But you're married.

1206
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:03,003
- To Christie.
- Yeah, but you've got children...

1207
01:24:03,128 --> 01:24:06,298
and you're a successful
real estate developer.

1208
01:24:07,924 --> 01:24:11,511
I do drywall for her old man's
construction company.

1209
01:24:11,637 --> 01:24:15,349
And-And you know this new kid?
Don't even know if he's mine.

1210
01:24:17,184 --> 01:24:19,061
So--

1211
01:24:19,186 --> 01:24:21,480
How about that room?

1212
01:24:26,193 --> 01:24:28,070
Okay.

1213
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:32,658
Why don't you go
and get that room?

1214
01:24:32,783 --> 01:24:36,370
Go and wash your face
and take off all your clothes...

1215
01:24:36,495 --> 01:24:38,538
and I'll be up there
in five minutes.

1216
01:24:38,664 --> 01:24:40,374
All right!

1217
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:45,379
Your fantasy
is gonna come true...

1218
01:24:45,504 --> 01:24:47,547
tonight.

1219
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:51,218
- See you later.
- Ugh-- Okay.

1220
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:02,729
- God.
- Now he's gonna see what
it feels like to wait.

1221
01:25:02,854 --> 01:25:05,691
- That's such a good one.
- Ladies.

1222
01:25:07,818 --> 01:25:13,198
- God, can you believe we're
going home in a helicopter?
- I know. It's so cool.

1223
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:16,868
I just wish everybody inside the reunion
would come out and see us lift off.

1224
01:25:16,994 --> 01:25:18,537
Ohh!

1225
01:25:18,662 --> 01:25:20,539
Thank you.

1226
01:25:23,959 --> 01:25:25,544
Oh.

1227
01:25:30,841 --> 01:25:35,595
Oh, my God! I'm so glad you didn't
bring your big notebook with you.

1228
01:25:35,721 --> 01:25:37,389
Michele.

1229
01:25:37,514 --> 01:25:41,226
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth

1230
01:25:41,351 --> 01:25:45,272
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1231
01:25:45,397 --> 01:25:48,942
They say in heaven
love comes first

1232
01:25:49,067 --> 01:25:52,446
We'll make heaven
a place on earth

1233
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:56,116
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1234
01:25:56,241 --> 01:25:59,661
Billy. Billy!

1235
01:25:59,786 --> 01:26:02,289
Billy, where are you?

1236
01:26:03,415 --> 01:26:06,918
Billy. Damn it.
Damn it!

1237
01:26:13,592 --> 01:26:15,761
Oh, my God.
Is that Heather?

1238
01:26:15,886 --> 01:26:18,680
Go for it, Heather!

1239
01:26:18,805 --> 01:26:22,142
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth

1240
01:26:23,518 --> 01:26:25,937
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1241
01:26:26,063 --> 01:26:29,691
They say in heaven
love comes first

1242
01:26:29,816 --> 01:26:31,693
Thanks for stopping by.

1243
01:26:31,818 --> 01:26:33,820
Yeah. Enjoy your fashions.

1244
01:26:33,945 --> 01:26:35,822
Have a Romy and Michele day.

1245
01:26:35,947 --> 01:26:38,492
- That was a good one.
- Thanks.

1246
01:26:38,617 --> 01:26:40,952
I cannot believe
how busy we've been.

1247
01:26:41,078 --> 01:26:44,956
I know. Hey, maybe we can
pay back Sandy this week.

1248
01:26:45,082 --> 01:26:48,043
Um, I think we're about, like,
two years away from that.

1249
01:26:48,168 --> 01:26:51,004
Oh. Okay.

1250
01:26:57,469 --> 01:27:01,014
Heather, um, has anyone ever told you
that smoking can kill you?

1251
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:04,309
No. No one. Thank you.

1252
01:27:04,434 --> 01:27:07,020
Okay, but if you burn it,
you bought it.

1253
01:27:07,145 --> 01:27:09,648
Like I give a shit.
I look like an asshole.

1254
01:27:09,773 --> 01:27:12,025
What? Nuh-uh.
You look totally cute.

1255
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:16,697
This dress exacerbates the genetic
betrayal that is my legacy.

1256
01:27:16,822 --> 01:27:19,157
Okay, I don't even know what you're
talking about because of those words...

1257
01:27:19,282 --> 01:27:21,159
but come here.

1258
01:27:21,284 --> 01:27:24,371
- Ow!
- God, that has been bugging me.

1259
01:27:24,496 --> 01:27:28,250
- Stay away from my bikini area.
- Um, okay.

1260
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:31,545
- I'm in a rush. Ring it up if you must.
- Okay.

1261
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,714
Let me have the tag, please.

1262
01:27:33,839 --> 01:27:35,716
Thank you.

1263
01:27:35,841 --> 01:27:37,718
You really do look cute.

1264
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:44,308
- You know what?
- Huh?

1265
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:48,687
Despite that surly demeanour, I think
we've just given her a big gift.

1266
01:27:48,812 --> 01:27:51,023
Okay, I mean,
to give someone...

1267
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:54,735
Iike Heather Mooney the chance
to express herself through fashion--

1268
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:57,279
We could've really
changed her life.

1269
01:27:57,404 --> 01:28:00,490
Yeah. For me though,
it's like...

1270
01:28:00,615 --> 01:28:03,493
I've given birth to
my own baby girl, you know?

1271
01:28:03,618 --> 01:28:05,662
Only she's, like,
a big giant girl...

1272
01:28:05,787 --> 01:28:08,665
who smokes
and says "shit" a lot.

1273
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:11,752
- You know?
- Yeah.

1274
01:28:11,877 --> 01:28:15,547
- Yeah. Let's fold scarves!
- Okay.

1275
01:28:18,091 --> 01:28:19,968
- You know what, Michele?
- Huh?

1276
01:28:20,093 --> 01:28:22,596
I think you are, like,
the funnest person I know.

1277
01:28:22,721 --> 01:28:24,931
Me too.
With you.

1278
01:28:33,774 --> 01:28:36,777
See the people
walkin' down the street

1279
01:28:36,902 --> 01:28:39,946
Fall in line
Just watchin' all the feet

1280
01:28:40,072 --> 01:28:42,616
They don't know
where everyone can go

1281
01:28:42,741 --> 01:28:45,160
But they're walkin'
in time

1282
01:28:45,285 --> 01:28:47,954
They got the beat
They got the beat

1283
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:52,626
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat

1284
01:28:59,091 --> 01:29:02,135
All the kids
just gettin' out of school

1285
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:05,305
They can't wait
to hang out and be cool

1286
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,641
Hang around
till quarter after twelve

1287
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:10,477
That's when
they fall in line

1288
01:29:10,602 --> 01:29:12,980
They got the beat

Kids got the beat
Yeah, kids got the beat

01:29:36,795 --> 01:29:39,965
Go Go music
really makes us dance

1291
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:43,135
In the crowd
it puts us in a trance

1292
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:45,470
We want to
So just give us a chance

1293
01:29:45,595 --> 01:29:48,307
That's when
we fall in line

1294

'Cause we got the beat
