00:00:00,323 --> 00:00:04,817
Tokuma Japan Corporation presents:

2
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:13,927
Over there!

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,095
Damn, they're going at it!

4
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,422
Man, even Hontani got knocked out cold!

5
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,220
Baba's the only one left now.

6
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:40,093
The Club's rep is history!

7
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,561
Damn! The entire Karate
Club is dead meat!

8
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:47,125
Captain Baba's the only one left!

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,795
Hey, that's Hyoudo, right?
He's kicking ass!

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,374
He's such a talented fighter,
number one in the club.

11
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,137
It's not surprising you've got
the hots for him, Megumi.

12
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:57,305
Hey, over there! There's
your rival!

13
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:04,478
Takayanagi is not just in Hyoudo's
class, but also in his clubs...

14
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:09,857
Ohh... I'm so jealous! She gets
to be with him all the time...

15
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:15,224
And, on top of that, she's charming...

16
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:17,766
...and she's got a
positive attitude.

17
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,428
On the other hand, look at you!

18
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:25,099
At this rate, she's gonna beat you
out. Is that what you want?

19
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:29,308
But... when I meet
Riki face to face...

20
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:31,313
...I never know
what to say...

21
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:34,373
...so all I can do is to watch
him from a distance.

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,454
Captain Baba, if you please...!

23
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,057
Sure... But it's not too late
to change your mind...

24
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,126
Think about it. If you quit
Karate, what will you do?

25
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,537
After defeating you, Baba,
I'll fight the masters...

26
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:58,199
...of all the schools, until I'm the
best in the world. That's all.

27
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:04,203
My, how glorious! The world's
best, huh? Cocky, aren't we!

28
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:07,475
You never know until you try, Baba.

29
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,698
Not bad, Hyoudo! Try
this on for size!

30
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,903
You dodged my Seikenzuki punch!

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,544
They don't call you "Captain" for nothing.

32
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:41,379
You're trying to regain your
mental balance...

33
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:44,011
...by maintaining a space between
us to observe my movements.

34
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:47,650
But, Captain Baba, I've made up my mind...

35
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,088
...and after I've finished
with you...

36
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,184
...my study of unconventional
techniques will continue.

37
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:54,456
Then I'll be the best damn fighter
in the entire world!

38
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:57,958
Gotcha!

39
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,970
Baba!

40
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:17,778
C... Captain! Captain!

41
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:35,200
Oh? Ryou, what's up?
Watcha doin' here?

42
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:37,636
Look who's talking! What's
up with you, Riki?

43
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:40,607
Huh? Oh, you mean
about today...?

44
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:44,010
I just wanted to test my limits,
you know, not just Karate...

45
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:48,245
You never told me anything
like that! Why so sudden?

46
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,081
Hey, wait!

47
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,587
I don't know why myself, but
I just felt like fighting!

48
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:55,623
What's that supposed to mean?!

49
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:59,219
Riki, do you know what you're doing?

50
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,387
Oh, leave me alone!

51
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:05,467
No I won't! Baba said he's gonna
resign because you beat him.

52
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:07,628
What will happen to our Club then?

53
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:08,738
Who knows.

54
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,602
What're you talking about?!
It's all your fault!

55
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:17,179
Baba said that in order for me to quit, I had
to knock out the entire club... So I did.

56
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:21,047
Besides, I had to quit the club in order to
compete with guys from other clubs.

57
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,353
Figures. You're only thinking
about yourself.

58
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:27,320
And what about the meet next month?!
Without you, we're screwed.

59
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,880
Hey, wait!

60
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,585
I haven't been doing karate
for the good of the club...

61
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:34,061
...and I wasn't competing for the
good of the school either!

62
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:36,688
You bastard! Don't you
run away from me!

63
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:40,395
I haven't finished talking
to you! Riki!

64
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:43,131
Well, see ya tomorrow!
Bye now!

65
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:46,265
You stubborn fool!

66
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:56,484
Legend of the True Demons
Battle Royal High School.

67
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,466
Lord Byoudo, the Dimensional
Gate has been opened...

68
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,806
As the legend foretells, when
the Gate is opened...

69
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:59,212
...the Leopard-headed warrior will appear
and face a being of the Dark Realm...

70
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:02,843
At that time, the legendary
warrior shall be born...

71
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,549
Your Majesty, thy power is
flowing into the Gate...

72
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,057
"Flowing?" You mean, my powers are
flowing into another dimension?

73
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:14,654
A dimension into which a passage is open?

74
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:20,801
Aye. Perhaps, it is being transmuted
into the power of Fate...

75
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,896
...the power that will produce
the legendary warrior.

76
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:29,275
Or perhaps it is already taking some
form in the other dimension...

77
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:34,078
If that is not the case, then perhaps
it is a trap laid by someone...

78
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:43,690
Perhaps it is the work of the heavens,
a plot to limit your Majesty's power...

79
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:47,319
...but why would anyone
wish such a thing...?

80
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,497
I care not...

81
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,695
The Dimensional Gate has been opened!

82
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,765
Your Highness!

83
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:06,013
The time has come to fight!

84
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,647
OK, so what I had just pointed
out to you was...

85
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:10,413
Hmm...? What's wrong,
Hyoudo?

86
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,384
Oh! Riki, you're
drooling!

87
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:16,253
The time has come to fight!

88
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:20,622
Yo, Riki! Wake up! You're
still in class!

89
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:24,423
That numbskull! What's
he thinking?!

90
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:27,631
Wake up, Hyoudo!

91
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,971
Yowch!

92
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,542
Damn, was I dreaming?!

93
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,509
Damn, was I dreaming?!
Dreaming what?!

94
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:33,643
Dreaming what?!

95
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:34,871
Stand!
Dreaming what?!

96
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:38,447
Hey, Hyoudo! I'm not
done with you!

97
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,811
Bow!

98
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,818
Lunch, dudes!

99
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,285
I'm gonna go buy some baked
goodies. Want anything?

100
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:47,889
Could you get me my usual?

101
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:49,116
No problemo!

102
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:52,694
There's a faculty meeting this afternoon to
discuss the mess you caused yesterday...

103
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:55,697
...and now you fall asleep in my class,
and even mumble while you're at it!

104
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:56,925
You're a real whiz!

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,366
You see, the Karate Club Captain, Baba,
is resigning to take responsibility.

106
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:01,970
The Club advisor, Mr. Ishiguro,
is not very happy.

107
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,405
It's possible you might get
left back, Hyoudo!

108
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:07,369
So, you did that?!

109
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:11,436
Everybody in school is talking about
the "Leopardmask Man!"

110
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:16,418
Riki thinks about nothing but putting
himself in the spotlight!

111
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,254
You beat the entire Karate Club?

112
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:18,743
You beat the entire Karate Club?
Yup...

113
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:20,515
Didn't know you were that strong!

114
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:21,624
What are you guys talking about?

115
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:22,825
You don't know?!

116
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:24,224
You don't know?!
Nope...

117
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,888
He fought the entire Karate Club, and
beat them all, just so he could quit!

118
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,499
No shit! Really? Wow!

119
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,828
But, why did you have to
wear a Leopard mask?

120
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:34,061
To get attention.

121
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:38,198
Besides, I found it in my house.
And I thought it was cool, so...

122
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:43,036
With this on, I'll be the #1 fighter
in the world, in all schools!

123
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:48,140
Captain Baba! Please reconsider,
for the sake of the Club!

124
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:49,683
Thanks...

125
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:51,845
...but I won't change
my mind.

126
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:55,823
I just handed in my resignation. You
see, I wasn't strong enough.

127
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,560
But, it was all Riki's fault...

128
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,790
But, it was all Riki's fault...
No, it was all mine.

129
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,124
Captain Baba!

130
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:05,291
I'm sorry if I sound selfish...

131
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:08,293
Here ya go! They didn't have
meat-pies today...

132
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:09,861
...so I brought cutlets and
egg sandwiches instead.

133
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:11,406
Twelve of 'em, as usual!

134
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,599
Thanks!

135
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:16,377
And so, I'll wear my mask like
a guerilla soldier...

136
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:20,280
...and I'll beat the hell out
of the other schools.

137
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:22,044
Eventually, the media is gonna flip over me!

138
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,779
And then I'll be in the papers
and on TV everywhere...

139
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,514
...and I'll get to mouth off
about everything!

140
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,020
And then? And then?
Then what?

141
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:31,126
Listen. Then, I'll get on the nerves of
those pro fighters with big egos...

142
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:34,391
...and when they accept my challenge,
the rest is history.

143
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:36,364
I'll just keep on kicking their butts,
and I'll be a major celebrity!

144
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:40,162
A World-Class celebrity from our
class?! That's awesome, man!

145
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:41,600
Say, if you'd like, you can have this.

146
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:43,137
Huh...? Are you sure?

147
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:47,902
I mean, if a future celebrity
has my lunch now...

148
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:51,606
...when you become real celebrity, I can
brag about it in my neighborhood!

149
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:55,377
Oh yeah? Thanks, man!

150
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:56,619
Here, it's for you!

151
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:58,610
Here, it's for you!
Then, if you don't mind!

152
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:04,288
Us country guys, we're so square!
You can have mine too!

153
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:05,762
Gee, thanks!

154
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:06,963
Gee, thanks!
Have mine too! Please!

155
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:07,096
Have mine too! Please!

156
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:07,930
Thanks!
Have mine too! Please!

157
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,064
Thanks!

158
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:09,766
Thanks!
Mine too!

159
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:09,899
Mine too!

160
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,833
And mine, please!
Mine too!

161
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,095
Why, everybody, thank you very much!

162
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,233
Huh...?! Ryou, you too?
You got a lunch for me?

163
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,901
Oh, you want my autograph!

164
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:28,183
What're you so happy about?! Baba
resigned from the Club, you know!

165
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:12,659
Master Byoudo... Pray, caution...
Do not underestimate them...

166
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,762
Naive fools...

167
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:20,302
Hmm...?

168
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,234
Two...

169
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,705
Three...

170
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:30,168
I see...

171
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:35,207
Why'd you do that...?!
Hey...? Guys?!

172
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:39,721
Uh-oh... Did I hit my head
too hard or...

173
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,584
She's cold...

174
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:49,688
It's hard! Huh...?

175
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,858
A... A classroom?!

176
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:56,268
What happened to the hallway?!
I DID hit my head hard!

177
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,704
Lemme see what's there.

178
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:03,438
That's weird... I didn't know we
had a classroom like this!

179
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:09,542
Lend me your ears...

180
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:16,354
Among my world's many legends,
one foretells this tale...

181
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:19,883
...that when the Gate of Light opens, a
Leopard-headed warrior will appear.

182
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:23,295
It is in his Otherworld that a fierce
battle will be fought...

183
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:27,268
But before the victor can conquer
the two worlds...

184
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:31,272
...he becomes the Leopard-headed
warrior, whom I must face.

185
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,036
The time that has been foretold has come!

186
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:41,014
Oh, fuck that shit! I'll kick your
ass! Come out and fight!

187
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:51,349
"I am Byoudo, Master of the Dark Realm..."

188
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,889
Byoudo, the Master of the Dark Realm?!

189
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:03,063
Damn! There's a few
too many of them!

190
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:16,080
I am Byoudo, the Master of the Dark Realm...

191
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:19,078
You're the Harem-King that
I saw in my dream!

192
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:22,887
I had imagined that it was merely
a matter of defeating you...

193
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,225
However, there is one thing
I must confirm...

194
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,190
W... What the...?

195
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:57,449
Got anything else you wanna show me?

196
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:03,823
Just as I had expected...

197
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,460
This was all a diabolical
trap, sprung on me...

198
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,369
...by someone who could not tolerate
my relentless increase in power.

199
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,335
Whatever you say, you fruitcake!

200
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:16,867
Stop mumbling and get on with it.
What's next...? Get a move on!

201
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,208
As you wish.

202
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:21,272
Raise your left arm...

203
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:24,282
And then what?

204
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:26,880
Ah...! Shit!

205
00:14:26,956 --> 00:14:29,618
You think you're funny...
You asshole...

206
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,592
Don't be foolish...

207
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:33,786
You paralyzed me!

208
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:36,989
I've realized, by coming here,
what the legend is saying.

209
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:41,366
By making me defeat you, it is warning
against extravagance on my part.

210
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:42,937
Huh...?

211
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:48,271
Don't you realize that you are another part
of me, a part that exists in this world...

212
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,335
You are my counterpart.

213
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:54,142
Oh shit... this guy's
a total nutcase!

214
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:56,581
Thanks, but I already have a father...

215
00:14:56,652 --> 00:15:02,648
...besides, it's almost time for class, so
we'll have to continue this chat later...

216
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:08,895
You think I'm a "nutcase."
You want to run away.

217
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:11,797
Oh my counterpart, what
a pitiful soul you are.

218
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:16,872
You can read my mind too?!
Come where I can see you!

219
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:19,600
My powers... Return to
where you belong...

220
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,733
What do you think you're
doing?! Stop it!

221
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:26,638
STOP!

222
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,618
You made me hit my head!

223
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:31,552
You made me hit my head!
What's the matter, Hyoudo?!

224
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:33,018
What the... I guess I was
dreaming after all.

225
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:35,350
And you think you're gonna be
the World Champion?! Ha!

226
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:37,482
You've got a long way to go, pal!

227
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:42,719
The hallway...

228
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,662
What's wrong?

229
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:47,203
Oh? It's Baba...

230
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:49,671
Oh? It's Baba...
What...?! It is!

231
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:52,997
Captain Baba! Hyoudo's gonna
apologize about the match...

232
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:55,009
...so please
reconsider!

233
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:56,112
What're you talking about!

234
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:57,739
What're you talking about!
Don't you see, it's all your fault!

235
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,280
Oh? Didn't he
hear me?

236
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:02,340
Captain Baba!

237
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:10,514
X- 0... 201-0... Echo 4513...

238
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:14,393
The subject has shifted around point Alpha by
amount Delta, location relatively unchanged.

239
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,725
Have you completed calculating
the total energy level?

240
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:20,461
It's being redone since the previously
computed value was infinite...

241
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:26,473
My guess is that a space-time continuum
distortion has affected our computers...

242
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:31,970
An infinite energy reading...
and an anti-matter node...

243
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:36,078
Without a doubt, the data clearly
indicates that it's...

244
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:39,553
...more than enough to change
the future of this planet.

245
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:41,988
It's been a while since we've
dealt with a major case.

246
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:49,196
Zankan! There's a body of energy
approaching point X-0!

247
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:52,701
It's appeared out of nowhere, and is
unlike the one we detected earlier!

248
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:54,537
It's a hyper-psycho-kinetic-wave!

249
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:57,005
It's a hyper-psycho-kinetic-wave!
What...?! What's the location?

250
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,474
Sir! It's at X-0!

251
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,838
That's dangerous! I'd better
go check it out!

252
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:05,548
Which one?

253
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:06,582
Which one?
The anti-matter node...

254
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:06,649
The anti-matter node...

255
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:07,850
Please be careful...
The anti-matter node...

256
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:07,917
Please be careful...

257
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,908
Please be careful...
Yeah...

258
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:16,685
In there?

259
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:20,362
Is that him? But, he's not
an anti-matter being...

260
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:24,622
The other one's here already?
That must be him...

261
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,691
The psycho-kinetic wave
activity... it's amazing!

262
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:29,736
You really can't tell a book
by it's cover, after all...

263
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:31,363
He couldn't have... not
from that far away!

264
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:34,704
There's no way he could spot me when
the Anti-ESPer Jammer's activated!

265
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:36,911
Have they started?

266
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:43,683
Starting today, I am the master
of the gangs in this territory...

267
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:45,878
Sez who...?!

268
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:47,886
What is this, a fuckin' joke?

269
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:53,760
Don't make us laugh! Fighting and
wussy sports ain't the same!

270
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:57,764
So, what're you gonna do
about it? C'mon, man!

271
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,891
Eat this!

272
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:06,365
You're a dead man, you asshole!

273
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:09,341
I thought you wanted to fight,
not show me your toys!

274
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:16,811
How do you like my toy now, asshole?

275
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:19,585
Like I said, a toy...

276
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:23,516
You can't finish me with toys...

277
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:27,057
W... What're you... a
fuckin' monster?!

278
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:34,561
Die, you bastard!

279
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:37,399
Women... should
be cuddled!

280
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:40,633
Bastard! Leggo!
Stop! Stop!

281
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:43,134
Who the fuck are you?

282
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:47,309
One, who by exterminating
creatures such as you...

283
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:51,012
...strives to perfect his humble
skills. That is who I am.

284
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:53,545
Exterminate me?

285
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:55,783
What're you... a Demon Master
or something?

286
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:58,791
"A Demon Master?" Do
they even exist?

287
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:02,464
You don't know, I see.

288
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:04,055
You gonna hurt me with that little stick?

289
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,133
L... L... Let go of me!

290
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:09,937
I can feel the demon inside him...
His aura is totally inhuman!

291
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:14,031
You are all mine to devour! And
there is nowhere to run!

292
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:30,248
That's an unusual chunk of wood.

293
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:32,317
But it's of no use, and now
you can't even move.

294
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:36,124
Behold, this is your fate!

295
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:44,202
What's the matter?

296
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:46,540
This way, the girl may die...

297
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:51,077
But I have no choice!

298
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:58,180
I never dreamed that creatures existed
that could transform people like this...

299
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:17,004
So, I didn't dispatch it completely!

300
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,214
Oh no you don't!

301
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:45,230
It's no use!

302
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:50,800
You can't run away from me!

303
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,581
There you are!
A fairy?

304
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:38,982
So, the man and the cat...

305
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:44,356
...were both controlled
by you!

306
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:49,989
That school has to be it... Now,
this is getting interesting...

307
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,734
Sound off! Loud!

308
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:52,968
Sound off! Loud!
Fight!

309
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:53,101
Fight!

310
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:53,302
Again!
Fight!

311
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:53,402
Again!

312
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:53,669
Again!
Fight!

313
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,802
Fight!

314
00:21:53,802 --> 00:21:53,969
Again!
Fight!

315
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:54,102
Again!

316
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:54,369
Again!
Fight!

317
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:54,503
Fight!

318
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:54,670
Again!
Fight!

319
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:54,803
Again!

320
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:54,837
Again!
Fight!

321
00:21:54,837 --> 00:21:55,170
Fight!

322
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:55,337
Again!
Fight!

323
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:55,471
Again!

324
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:57,795
OK... see ya tomorrow!

325
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,771
Catch you tomorrow!

326
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:02,137
...and, get this, guess what
Yamauchi is up to...

327
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:05,769
Hey, guys, wait up! Don't
leave me behind!

328
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:15,116
That must be him.

329
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,988
Either he's very inexperienced,
or his power is so great...

330
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,426
...that he's barely able
to contain it.

331
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:25,957
Hmm...? He's come... Just as I
expected, he's come for me...

332
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:29,360
Wanna do it?

333
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:34,540
Are you the Demon Master of
this world? Wanna try me?

334
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:38,938
Oops! Wrong one!

335
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:43,950
Damn!

336
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:48,986
Hey, what's going on?
Weird!

337
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:52,616
Think you've gotten away from me?

338
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:56,658
The primary subject has teleported.
Can you tell me its new location?

339
00:22:57,132 --> 00:23:00,499
Roger. The subject has moved
to... grid-ref 2031...

340
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:04,096
It's the park, above a small
hill, 2 km to the east.

341
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:06,764
Got it. Keep him under
surveillance.

342
00:23:06,842 --> 00:23:09,208
I'll switch over to our secondary subject.

343
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,333
Roger.

344
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:14,008
Incredible!

345
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:16,880
He's clearly following the primary subject.

346
00:23:16,952 --> 00:23:18,886
This is no trivial matter.

347
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:27,862
I'll keep on monitoring their activities.
Analyze the data for me.

348
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:30,623
He must be in there.

349
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:36,970
So, you've come.

350
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,874
You monster! There's no
escape for you now!

351
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,879
Reveal yourself!

352
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,543
H... Hold on! I was only trying
to kick a pebble...

353
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:54,145
...but then I missed it and
kicked the car instead!

354
00:23:54,723 --> 00:23:57,157
Don't try to fool me!

355
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:04,095
How's this possible?! Can
he read my mind?!

356
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,191
No!

357
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:08,959
Do not mock me!

358
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,701
None of your impudence!

359
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:22,842
His powers are several magnitudes
greater than the first creature's!

360
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,032
Your attempts at intimidation
are most entertaining.

361
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:42,466
The world is full of all kinds of people...

362
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,171
Th... This can't be
happening...

363
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:53,740
Popping out of the wound...
Now, that's impressive!

364
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:58,216
That was a unique maneuver you used.

365
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:01,278
Your powers are nothing
like the first creature's.

366
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:03,719
Now, listen to what I have to say!

367
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:06,692
I'm not interested in carrying out
a conversation with a monster!

368
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,062
Damn!

369
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:12,523
Listen to me before you attack!

370
00:25:14,136 --> 00:25:16,434
You took away my sword...

371
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:20,331
We can still fight after I'm
done talking to you!

372
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:26,075
I am Byoudo, the Ruler of the Dark Realm...

373
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:29,117
I have arrived to this world in hopes
of making a prophecy come true...

374
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:33,746
However, I fell into a trap laid
by one of my followers.

375
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:37,222
Is that your justification for implanting
yourself inside people...

376
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:39,921
...transforming them
into monsters?!

377
00:25:40,062 --> 00:25:42,826
Wait! This body is that
of Riki Hyoudo.

378
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:48,165
He is my counterpart in this world, in
whom all my powers are contained...

379
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:49,726
...all because
of the trap.

380
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:52,103
We have merged into one body, but
my own will is being suppressed...

381
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,008
...by your counterpart?

382
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,169
...by your counterpart?
Exactly!

383
00:25:56,745 --> 00:26:00,841
You see, the monsters you fought were
the Fairy Master and her minions.

384
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:04,477
And, the reason I am here is to
destroy their breeding nests.

385
00:26:04,553 --> 00:26:07,044
They are a nuisance, if left alone...

386
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:09,454
Take a look at this...

387
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:12,891
They have characteristics very
similar to those of wasps...

388
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:15,225
They first invade other living organisms...

389
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:18,460
...then hunt for new prey,
to feed their offspring...

390
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:24,470
They breed like roaches, you see... If left
alone, there'll be no end...

391
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:28,470
In the time that it took me to destroy
one, 30 more have appeared...

392
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,477
There'll be no end to it, that's for sure...

393
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:34,115
They are the true demons, who prey
on peoples' weaknesses...

394
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:36,650
You gruesome maggots!

395
00:26:36,718 --> 00:26:39,152
Their master... once
my follower...

396
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:41,746
...plotted to revolt
against me.

397
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:45,259
This world teems with prey that'll
become food for the Fairies...

398
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:49,320
If we don't put an end to them
now, before they spread...

399
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:52,298
...this world will become theirs.
You won't enjoy it, I'm sure.

400
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:53,332
Indeed...

401
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:58,235
Therefore, I'd like to postpone
our duel until a later date...

402
00:26:58,306 --> 00:26:59,330
Are we agreed?

403
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:03,740
Fine. Until we defeat those fairies, or whatever
they are, our duel will be a matter for the future.

404
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:08,977
I'm Toshimitsu Yuuki, people
call me a "Demon Slayer."

405
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,454
A Demon Master from another
universe, and the fairies...

406
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:20,995
This doesn't sound too simple...

407
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:22,425
What's up?

408
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:26,830
Zankan? The second of those anti-
matter bodies has started moving.

409
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:28,961
It's at a location 3km from
your current position.

410
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:31,004
Roger!

411
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:40,644
Toshimitsu Yuuki...

412
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:45,014
Hyoudo...

413
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:47,077
Riki...

414
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:50,347
Riki...

415
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:53,690
Oh! A shooting star!

416
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:56,526
My dear shooting star, please
hear my wish...

417
00:27:57,232 --> 00:27:58,790
Yeah, right!

418
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:02,303
If wishes really did come true, then
everything would be so easy...

419
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:05,539
Besides, I've got a major rival
in Megumi Takayanagi...

420
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:07,939
Oh, this isn't easy, is it, Teddy?

421
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:13,910
But... I'm still in love
with Riki Hyoudo...

422
00:28:13,982 --> 00:28:15,973
Huh...?

423
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,462
Oh! A fairy?

424
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:32,764
Let me make your wishes come true...

425
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:37,261
Let me lend a helping hand...

426
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:57,787
Someone's following me...
from behind...

427
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:01,295
Behind the trees, eh? I wonder
if it's some kinda pervert...

428
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:04,059
Well wouldn't that be interesting...

429
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,657
Who's there?! Show yourself!

430
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:27,144
Whaaat?! A teddy bear?!

431
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:30,691
This is unbearably weird!

432
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,624
Don't scare me like
that! Geez!

433
00:29:32,694 --> 00:29:35,492
First you're a leopard, now you're a bear?!

434
00:29:35,563 --> 00:29:36,962
It's you, isn't it, Riki!

435
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:53,542
Ladies have to be careful when
walking alone at night.

436
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:59,687
You're much too fluffy to
be a serious opponent!

437
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:04,847
Such strength! Not bad
for a stuffed animal!

438
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:10,995
Stay out of this!

439
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:12,394
What... the hell...?!

440
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:16,299
Huh? The bear is only
a virtual image...

441
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:18,862
The real object is that
little stuffed animal...

442
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,172
What...?! It's energy is derived from
emotional stress?! Impossible!

443
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:24,939
This can't be!

444
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:27,412
I don't believe it!

445
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:30,317
How can emotional stress
take on tangible form?!

446
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:33,411
What's going on around here?!

447
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,526
I'm sorry if I've frightened
you. Are you OK?

448
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,423
Wh...? Y... Yeah...

449
00:30:41,262 --> 00:30:43,560
I see. I'm glad.

450
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:44,893
Allow me...

451
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:48,594
Thank you very much...
Er... if I may ask...

452
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:51,262
Oh, me?

453
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:55,833
My name is Zankan. I'm a Space-
Time Continuum Inspector.

454
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,402
Since yesterday afternoon,
we've been monitoring...

455
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:02,143
...a rash of spatial distortions
near your school.

456
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:05,812
The stuffed bear we just saw may be
a side-effect of the distortions.

457
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:09,084
There are a few questions I'd like to
ask you regarding that, if I may.

458
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:10,714
Huh...?!

459
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:13,259
Oh, I know! Allow me
to escort you home.

460
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:16,320
That way, I can ask you the
questions while we walk.

461
00:31:16,698 --> 00:31:19,223
O... OK!

462
00:31:21,436 --> 00:31:23,529
Oh? Where did
you go?

463
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:25,038
Hey, Teddy!

464
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:27,334
Have you become jealous
of Hyoudo or something?

465
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:30,244
You failed?

466
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:33,678
What's that all about?
I'm going to bed!

467
00:31:36,785 --> 00:31:39,913
Good night, Hyoudo.

468
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:44,419
A 2-meter high
teddybear...

469
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:46,926
...and a detective from
outer-space, you say?

470
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:51,256
That space-detective
person... er...

471
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:54,859
...inspector So-and-so... was
asking things about you.

472
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:58,565
Have you done something that would
make them investigate you?

473
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:01,937
Do you have a fever or something? Or, you
had a nightmare or something, I bet.

474
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:05,806
Erase her memory of last night...

475
00:32:05,947 --> 00:32:08,472
Huh...? What was
I just saying?

476
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:13,280
Wow! Takayanagi is at it already,
in the middle of the day! Cool!

477
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:15,184
Uh-huh...

478
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:18,815
Oh...? Megumi, you
don't look good.

479
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,828
I'm alright...

480
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:22,023
I'm alright...
Yo, Hyoudo!

481
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:25,564
Someone from another school is here to chal-
lenge you in anything-goes Martial Arts!

482
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,531
Huh...?

483
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:32,333
I would wager that the space-detective
has come to investigate.

484
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:33,408
So where is he?

485
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:36,571
He's already in the
Karate Dojo, waiting for you!

486
00:32:36,711 --> 00:32:38,542
Gotcha! I'll be
right there!

487
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:42,413
Alright!

488
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:46,384
Riki...

489
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:50,547
You must be Hyoudo.

490
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:53,394
And you are?

491
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:54,986
And you are?
I'm Zankan.

492
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,328
As a person, and as a warrior, will
you accept this challenge?

493
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:03,296
You're here "as a person, and as
a warrior," eh? Interesting.

494
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:06,772
Fine. I'll accept anyone's
challenge.

495
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:09,877
Yo, Hyoudo! Man, what's up with you?!
This is the Karate Dojo, of all places!

496
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:12,003
Take your shoes off!
Your shoes!

497
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,571
Oops, forgot about that!

498
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:17,919
And, put these on too.

499
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,284
And, put these on too.
I know.

500
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:22,886
You forgot your Leopard Mask too.

501
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:23,958
Oh, I don't need that anymore.

502
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,326
Oh, I don't need that anymore.
Huh? You're not gonna use it?

503
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:25,460
Huh? You're not gonna use it?

504
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:25,994
That's right.
Huh? You're not gonna use it?

505
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:26,127
That's right.

506
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:26,928
That's right.
How come?

507
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:27,061
How come?

508
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:29,461
Quiet, man! Just shut up and watch!
How come?

509
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,157
Sorry to keep you waiting.

510
00:33:35,303 --> 00:33:37,362
Just what brings you here?

511
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:40,269
I am here to see whether or not
we can have a little talk.

512
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:05,098
Not bad.

513
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,134
Huh...? My arms
and legs!

514
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:10,066
He made it look as if he was merely
dodging your strikes...

515
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:12,129
...but he got to your
pressure points.

516
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:15,071
Well?

517
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,472
What's up?!

518
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:19,273
Huh...? I feel like I've met
that guy somewhere...

519
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:21,541
Next, he'll probably finish you off.

520
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:23,378
Don't tell me like it's happening
to someone else!

521
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,750
If I can't move, you're gonna
be feeling the pain too!

522
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:30,187
If you fail to dodge my next strike...

523
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:33,193
...you're going
to die!

524
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:34,694
Is that what you want?

525
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:37,161
Oh, FUCK!

526
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:43,198
Alright!

527
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:49,939
Looks like a draw.

528
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:52,410
Well... something like
that, I suppose.

529
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:56,181
If there's something you wanted to
discuss, talk to the Man Himself.

530
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:59,647
Looks like there's still a chance to talk.

531
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:02,250
Wanna go up to the roof or some place?

532
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,188
Sure. I'd like that,
if you don't mind.

533
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,197
I knew you'd come...

534
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,108
I've been waiting here, confessing my
uncertainties. The wait has paid off.

535
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:27,011
You are surely a demon that seeks
out people's weaknesses...

536
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:35,821
Why are you uncertain? You're the
mighty destroyer of demons!

537
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,915
Let me lend a helping hand...

538
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:41,393
A aura barricade!

539
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:44,394
You've made your move, I see.

540
00:35:47,302 --> 00:35:49,270
You think you've fooled me?

541
00:35:53,808 --> 00:35:55,435
Only one remains...

542
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:57,203
I shall say this unto thee...

543
00:35:57,278 --> 00:36:00,907
Art thou so afraid of my powers that you
must cower within your barriers?

544
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:02,607
What?!

545
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:07,344
Fool! Byoudo took your sword,
and now you know fear!

546
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:09,615
Silence!

547
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:13,784
I'm not so naive as to fall for your tricks.

548
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:15,726
Reveal yourself, Fairy Master!

549
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:18,630
Whatever you do, you can't
break these barriers.

550
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:23,797
I am Kayn, the Demon Master of the fairies.

551
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:27,101
"The Demon Master
of the fairies...?"

552
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:30,836
I am here in this world to
assassinate Byoudo.

553
00:36:30,912 --> 00:36:32,641
Behold this...

554
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:35,841
Byoudo, not satisfied with
ruling the Dark Realm...

555
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:39,148
...has come to this world intending
to rule it as well.

556
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:43,550
There's nobody on this planet strong enough to interfere
with whatever you are really capable of doing.

557
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:46,593
If you refrain from using your powers,
and merely observe, I will permit it...

558
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:49,061
...but if you intend to include yourself
in this planet's history...

559
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,655
...then I am officially obligated
to do something about that.

560
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:58,862
I shall become the ruler of this world regardless of your obligations.
If you must interfere... then you may challenge me at any time.

561
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:02,739
But, you want to delay our duel
at a later time, correct?

562
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:05,005
As soon as you've defeated this
Fairy Master, or whatever it is...

563
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,979
...I advise you to go
back to your world.

564
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:09,209
If you don't return freely, then
I will have to use force.

565
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:12,576
I do not take orders from anyone.

566
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,950
I suggest you learn how.

567
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:17,023
What is it that you want to say?

568
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:20,719
If Byoudo should become
the ruler of this world...

569
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:25,255
...then all living souls will be forced to
follow his orders, upon pain of death.

570
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,698
That is undesirable.

571
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:30,462
Well...? I propose
we join forces.

572
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:32,802
If we do, then this world...
and the Dark Realm...

573
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:35,502
...will once again
be at peace.

574
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:39,136
I refuse!

575
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:45,784
If you can't defeat me, how can
you possibly defeat Byoudo?

576
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:48,819
How did you break the barriers?!

577
00:37:51,826 --> 00:37:54,920
They were useless from the very beginning.

578
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:58,022
Even though your conscious
will refuses me...

579
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:01,034
...your true desire is
to defeat Byoudo.

580
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:03,400
Your body betrays you...

581
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:13,575
Allow me make your dreams come true...

582
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,552
W... What are
you doing?!

583
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:22,582
Let us merge together...

584
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,926
...and become a being...

585
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,723
...transcending any mere
Demon Master...

586
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:32,232
B... Begone!

587
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,291
Begone!

588
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:53,420
There will be a school meeting
during the 3rd and 4th periods.

589
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:56,889
All 1st-year and 2nd-year students
must report to the gym.

590
00:38:56,958 --> 00:39:01,622
All student council members from
each class, and class officers...

591
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:02,797
...report to the council room at once.

592
00:39:02,797 --> 00:39:04,499
...report to the council room at once.
Megumi, how are you feeling?

593
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:04,632
Megumi, how are you feeling?

594
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:06,601
To repeat... There will be a school...
Megumi, how are you feeling?

595
00:39:06,601 --> 00:39:06,667
To repeat... There will be a school...

596
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,658
To repeat... There will be a school...
Maybe you should skip the meeting.

597
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:11,033
It's OK, I'm fine.

598
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,451
Say, Riki? Have I been acting
weird at all lately?

599
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:28,020
Yup. You're a pervert.

600
00:39:28,155 --> 00:39:30,555
That's not what I meant!

601
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:34,459
It's just that... I've been very forgetful
these past few days.

602
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,654
Really?

603
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:42,068
Oh... Sandy...

604
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,666
Zankan?

605
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:48,472
What is it?

606
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:50,975
I've just detected strong psycho-
kinetic-wave activity.

607
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:57,951
The location is S-205... N-50... Z-124...
just 200 meters from your location!

608
00:40:03,024 --> 00:40:05,015
That must be him.

609
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:09,456
Psycho-kinetic-wave activity
is very unstable.

610
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,624
That's very disturbing. I'd
better go check it out.

611
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,294
Sandy, I'll have to interrupt
my stakeout of Hyoudo.

612
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:16,358
Will you take over for me?

613
00:40:16,504 --> 00:40:18,495
OK. Be careful.

614
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:26,780
And... I feel like my false memories
are more real...

615
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:30,813
Oh! Takayanagi! Is Hyoudo
playing hooky again?

616
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:31,782
Huh...?!

617
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:34,752
If he doesn't go to the meeting,
he'll be in big trouble.

618
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:37,950
Takayanagi, could you do me a
favor and go look for him...

619
00:40:38,025 --> 00:40:39,890
I'll go talk to the committee
in the meantime.

620
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:54,835
What's the rush? Where
are you going?

621
00:40:55,476 --> 00:40:58,036
I see that your psycho-kinetic-
wave activity is unstable...

622
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,843
Is there an emergency you have to take
care of while school's in session?

623
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:04,681
I'd be very interested in knowing.

624
00:41:04,752 --> 00:41:06,845
Would you mind telling me?

625
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:10,618
So, you're the one who's been following
me around these last few days.

626
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:13,626
I'm sorry... but I have
to get going.

627
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:16,730
Hold it right there! I have to verify
something right now!

628
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:23,799
Just as I thought!

629
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:33,373
You intend to stop me?

630
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:35,539
I see that your "business"
must be very important...

631
00:41:36,784 --> 00:41:38,149
In which case...

632
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:39,709
...there's even more
reason...

633
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:41,914
...why I cannot
let you go!

634
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,457
Even if it means a duel to the death!

635
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:47,459
Are you sure about that? Because
it is you who will die.

636
00:41:48,562 --> 00:41:50,154
We'll see about that!

637
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:56,035
Now they're going at it?!

638
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,434
"Chemistry Lab."

639
00:42:02,877 --> 00:42:04,868
Hmm...?

640
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:24,125
Who's there?!

641
00:42:45,486 --> 00:42:48,182
My, my... What an
awful sight.

642
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:50,917
Your folks are gonna weep when they
see you lookin' like this, guys.

643
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,301
Seems like you have surely
stopped being human.

644
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:05,361
In which case, it's time for you
to stop being alive.

645
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,314
It's no use. You can't
break those bonds.

646
00:43:23,758 --> 00:43:27,159
Bye.

647
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:38,166
Do you understand now? Return
to where you came from.

648
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:41,172
Not bad. You've obviously been
possessed by the Fairy Master!

649
00:43:42,443 --> 00:43:43,842
You fool!

650
00:43:44,512 --> 00:43:48,642
You could've lived if you
hadn't bothered me...

651
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:52,078
That's just what I wanted to hear.

652
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:53,880
What?

653
00:43:54,855 --> 00:44:00,384
Without solid evidence, I cannot
simply destroy a suspect.

654
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:04,892
But thanks to your confession...
I need not restrain myself!

655
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,793
I see. Very interesting.

656
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:13,898
In that case... without restraint...
I'll destroy you!

657
00:44:14,675 --> 00:44:16,768
You're the one who will die!

658
00:44:16,844 --> 00:44:18,573
I don't know what your motives are...

659
00:44:18,646 --> 00:44:21,877
...but your powers threaten
this world's stability.

660
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:26,511
As the Space-Time Continuum Inspector,
I cannot allow you to proceed.

661
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:29,681
Behold my true powers!

662
00:44:30,724 --> 00:44:32,658
Take your best shot.

663
00:44:34,228 --> 00:44:37,664
Oh... Hyoudo...

664
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:39,832
You're awake.

665
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,164
It's all right now. Nothing
to worry about, OK?

666
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:49,074
Hyoudo! Hyoudo!
Hyoudo!

667
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,476
Uh... Ah... It's OK. I wasted those
assholes, so don't worry.

668
00:44:53,614 --> 00:44:55,673
I've always loved you!

669
00:44:55,749 --> 00:44:58,582
I've always been watching you...

670
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:01,085
Er...? Huh?

671
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:18,528
Hyoudo... Help me...

672
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:28,578
What a fool...

673
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:32,676
It thought that we wouldn't notice.

674
00:45:33,487 --> 00:45:35,717
This must be the mother of the
ones we just destroyed.

675
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:37,723
So, this is the 3rd Fairy...

676
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:40,383
It would've been cool if that little
act had lasted a little longer.

677
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:42,452
Bummer!

678
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:51,729
I'll end up killing you...
Help me!

679
00:45:52,773 --> 00:45:53,797
Yo, Mr. Narrator!

680
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:56,842
Her consciousness hasn't been devoured yet.

681
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:59,106
I take it that she loves me a great deal.

682
00:45:59,246 --> 00:46:02,044
Not YOU! The one
she loves is ME!

683
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:05,743
I can't hold on any longer...
Come on... Hyoudo...

684
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:07,753
Quickly... finish me...

685
00:46:07,888 --> 00:46:09,879
Yeah. I'll kill you...

686
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:34,375
Such an inferior demon, trying
to pull off such a lame stunt!

687
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:37,281
Even though you're just lumps of meat,
I'm not finished with you yet!

688
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:47,324
Eat this!

689
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:50,259
You fool! Things like that are
of no use against me.

690
00:46:50,931 --> 00:46:52,922
What?!

691
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,158
Gotcha!

692
00:46:59,707 --> 00:47:01,641
As I said, it is of no use against me.

693
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:02,937
So I'll send it back to you!

694
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,011
You eat it!

695
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:05,478
You eat it!
OH SHIT!

696
00:47:15,622 --> 00:47:17,385
C'mon, C'mon, get me if you can!

697
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:20,859
I'll make minced-meat
out of you!

698
00:47:33,841 --> 00:47:36,833
Fuck! This guy won't even
obey the Laws of Physics!

699
00:47:36,977 --> 00:47:41,471
What's the matter? Was this it? Was
that all of your "true powers?"

700
00:47:41,548 --> 00:47:43,345
Our duel is not over yet.

701
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:46,349
Fine. Time to get
serious!

702
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:14,170
Let me see... Now the
real work begins.

703
00:48:18,552 --> 00:48:21,544
Forget her. Why bother?

704
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:23,315
You stay quiet!

705
00:48:52,086 --> 00:48:54,486
You've got some interesting moves.

706
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:58,751
Don't worry... just one blow from
this, and you're history.

707
00:48:58,892 --> 00:49:00,382
Why, thank you for your consideration.

708
00:49:11,939 --> 00:49:13,372
Prepare yourself!

709
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:26,878
You think I'll fall for the same
trick over and over again?!

710
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:06,281
Most Excellent!

711
00:50:20,874 --> 00:50:23,069
It's obvious that you are exhausted.

712
00:50:23,143 --> 00:50:25,134
Even in my Dark Realm, the
reconstruction of Life...

713
00:50:25,212 --> 00:50:27,305
...takes more energy
than anything else.

714
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:29,372
Those guys must be finished.

715
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:40,517
What a fool...

716
00:50:41,962 --> 00:50:43,953
Such naivet.

717
00:50:49,036 --> 00:50:50,970
A spiritual forcefield!

718
00:50:51,038 --> 00:50:53,666
Seems I'm a mite too late.

719
00:50:54,908 --> 00:50:57,433
Looks like you will no longer
bother the Fairy Master.

720
00:50:58,045 --> 00:51:01,742
Yuuki... A coup de gr? E?
That ain't like you.

721
00:51:02,616 --> 00:51:04,948
You look pretty exhausted.

722
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:08,749
Even so, why don't we pick up where
we left off, and resume our duel.

723
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:13,216
Sure. Let's!

724
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:30,501
Don't attempt to block his attacks
directly... or you'll surely die!

725
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:32,578
I'd appreciate it if you tell me
these things in advance!

726
00:51:32,646 --> 00:51:34,546
What with everything I did
earlier, I'm pooped!

727
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:35,579
Then flee!

728
00:51:35,716 --> 00:51:38,241
You make it sound like he's already won!

729
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:40,387
You didn't tell me it would be like this!

730
00:51:40,387 --> 00:51:43,151
You didn't tell me it would be like this!
The Lord of the Dark Realm, fleeing?

731
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,757
I won't permit it!

732
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,694
In coming to this world, you've acquired all manner of
human weaknesses. How could anyone fear you now, Byoudo?

733
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:01,734
Now I get it...

734
00:52:10,384 --> 00:52:12,375
He's one of them...

735
00:52:17,524 --> 00:52:19,185
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

736
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:23,023
Silence! I did it
to defeat you!

737
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:48,478
Just think, those punks in the laboratory
were almost enough to destroy you...

738
00:52:48,555 --> 00:52:51,922
So much for the "Lord
of the Dark Realm..."

739
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:56,894
If we get hit again, we're dead meat!
What the fuck do we do now...?

740
00:53:02,235 --> 00:53:05,329
Badly wounded, I see...

741
00:53:05,472 --> 00:53:07,497
He's coming for me!

742
00:53:14,014 --> 00:53:16,949
Now it's merely a matter of time.

743
00:53:17,884 --> 00:53:20,717
Byoudo... Fleeing
in terror...

744
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:21,955
What?!

745
00:53:21,955 --> 00:53:23,286
What?!
Yuuki!

746
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:28,226
You asshole! How
could you?!

747
00:53:30,664 --> 00:53:33,428
How could you let the Fairy
Master take you over?!

748
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,300
You've lost your soul...

749
00:53:43,443 --> 00:53:48,244
...and you've defeated yourself...
You, who were once a Master!

750
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:54,415
Now look at you!

751
00:53:54,554 --> 00:53:56,545
Take your own advice!

752
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:05,562
That horn will continue to slowly
bore into you, until you die!

753
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:07,657
Savor the pain!

754
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:14,339
As subjects of the Dark Realm, we had
to endure the torment you inflicted...

755
00:54:14,408 --> 00:54:17,036
Now the anguish is yours to enjoy!

756
00:54:18,812 --> 00:54:22,805
This is Byoudo? The Lord
of the Dark Realm?!

757
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,713
Now the time of our sweet
vengeance is at hand!

758
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:32,225
Face the truth!

759
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:35,786
You came to this world...

760
00:54:38,932 --> 00:54:42,424
...only to be beaten to a pulp, thanks
to your foolish counterpart.

761
00:54:42,502 --> 00:54:44,493
You're history...

762
00:54:57,784 --> 00:54:59,615
Have you lost your mind, Byoudo...?

763
00:54:59,753 --> 00:55:01,846
I owe you my thanks...

764
00:55:01,922 --> 00:55:05,153
The pain from this horn has rendered
my counterpart unconscious...

765
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:06,783
...and now I am
in control.

766
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,229
Now I can use my powers in any way I desire!

767
00:55:12,098 --> 00:55:13,998
Don't make me laugh!

768
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:16,034
Witness my powers!

769
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:30,806
Byoudo, you bastard!

770
00:56:07,454 --> 00:56:08,716
Uh-oh!

771
00:56:08,788 --> 00:56:10,187
Shit!

772
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:17,228
No, he's not on the 3rd Floor
either! Oooh, that idiot...!

773
00:56:17,531 --> 00:56:19,761
Where is he?!

774
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:34,142
Oh, there you are! I was
looking all over for you!

775
00:56:34,281 --> 00:56:36,545
NO! Stay away!

776
00:56:36,616 --> 00:56:38,914
This... This ain't what
it looks like, OK?

777
00:56:39,052 --> 00:56:41,316
Riki...

778
00:56:41,454 --> 00:56:42,921
This is all a big mistake!

779
00:56:42,989 --> 00:56:45,219
Wait! Will you wait?!
Look, I'm tired, OK!

780
00:56:46,393 --> 00:56:47,485
Knock it off! Listen
to what I...

781
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:50,152
Just what'cha got to say, you jerk?!

782
00:56:50,297 --> 00:56:52,595
Eyaah! Stop that! Stop!
I abhor violence!

783
00:56:52,732 --> 00:56:55,098
Jerk! Bastard! Rat! You stop
right there, you pervert!

784
00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:58,600
Zankan? How long do you plan
to hang around down there?

785
00:56:59,506 --> 00:57:02,498
Oh, yeah... Er, why WAS I here in the
first place? I can't remember.

786
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:04,044
Beam me up, Sandy!

787
00:57:04,044 --> 00:57:06,035
Beam me up, Sandy!
Roger!

788
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:50,056
As if you'll be turning everything
to cold stone...

789
00:57:50,123 --> 00:57:55,161
...you gaze with bated
breath... Medusa!

790
00:57:55,228 --> 00:58:00,300
When you've finished sifting through
all the lines men always feed you...

791
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:05,372
What do you want? What
do you want to do?

792
00:58:08,842 --> 00:58:11,778
Using the passion inside you, you make
yourself amazingly seductive...

793
00:58:11,778 --> 00:58:11,845
English Voice Cast Using the passion inside
you, you make yourself amazingly seductive...

794
00:58:11,845 --> 00:58:14,080
Using the passion inside you, you make
yourself amazingly seductive...

795
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:19,219
You transform into one cool
babe... Medusa!

796
00:58:19,285 --> 00:58:24,324
Your fingertips glisten at the moment
you're ready to cast your spell...

797
00:58:24,424 --> 00:58:29,429
What do you want? What
do you want to do?

798
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:40,240
I'll let you see my sinful dreams, deep
inside my eyes you'll see...

799
00:58:40,306 --> 00:58:41,408
For the perfect life, I've got
to put on the magic!

800
00:58:41,408 --> 00:58:43,810
For the perfect life, I've got.

801
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,445
For the perfect life, I've got
to put on the magic!

802
00:58:45,512 --> 00:58:52,152
For the perfect life, I've got
to put on the spell!

803
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:57,791
Shining, Shining, Shining Girl!
