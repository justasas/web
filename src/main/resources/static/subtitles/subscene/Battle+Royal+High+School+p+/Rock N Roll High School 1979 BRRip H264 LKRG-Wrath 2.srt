00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:20,570
Come on, girls.
That's right.

346
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:22,272
Peppy!

347
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:25,574
Keep that up
till I get back.

348
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:36,736
Well, you're probably wondering
why I called you here.

349
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:37,786
Me.
I know, I know.

350
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:39,120
Me.
I know.

351
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,405
I know, I know.
Me.

352
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:42,924
Go and monitor
the halls.

353
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:52,933
Since assuming office
this morning,

354
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:55,269
I've noticed a number
of peculiar incidents

355
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,470
Among the members
of the student body,

356
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:01,108
All having to do
with rock-'n'-roll music.

357
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,976
Miss Togar, I have
no particular love
for rock-'n'-roll,

358
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,646
But it doesn't seem to me
that listening to it

359
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,614
Actually hurts
the students.

360
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,984
<i>(laughs) but that's
where you're wrong,
Mr. Mcgree.</i>

361
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,086
Recently,
I have been doing a study

362
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,255
Of mice subjected
to rock-'n'-roll music.

363
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,826
Here we have a picture
of this mouse,

364
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,846
<i>A typical member
of the genus rattus rodenti,</i>

365
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:27,999
As he appeared
before the start
of my investigation -

366
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,501
Clean, good-natured,

367
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:36,040
Content to scamper playfully
about his cage.

368
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:41,712
This is a picture
of the same mouse...

369
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:45,348
One week after the introduction
of rock-'n'-roll music.

370
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:46,799
I never dreamed.

371
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,852
Oh, the results
were dramatic.

372
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,020
He lost all interest

373
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:53,223
In keeping
his cage tidy.

374
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:54,690
How scientific.

375
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:56,975
He played
his electric guitar
far into the night,

376
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:59,210
Keeping the other
test animals awake.

377
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:00,512
He did?

378
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,514
And he met
this female mouse,

379
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:05,016
And they have been sharing
a cage together

380
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:06,685
Out of wedlock.

381
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:08,904
That's fascinating,
Miss Togar.

382
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:12,907
Yes, it is.

383
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:15,342
Is she crazy?

384
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:16,961
She's a principal.

385
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:18,963
Monitor the hall,
monitor the hall.

386
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:21,899
I am sick
of monitoring the hall.

387
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,934
Yep.

388
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,304
Let's go monitor
the freshman.
Good idea.

389
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:28,438
Get him.

390
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,273
All right,
up against the wall.

391
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:31,942
Spread 'em.

392
00:20:31,943 --> 00:20:34,711
All right, what the hell
do you think you're doing
out here?

393
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:36,545
I was just getting
my books.

394
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:39,514
Listen,
you have a hall pass?
Well, no.

395
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:42,517
<i>(both) no hall pass?
Hit him, hit him.</i>

396
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:46,055
Guys, I'm allergic to violence.
I break out in blood.
Hit him anyway.

397
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:48,489
Calm down.
Let me see some id.
I haven't got all day.

398
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,491
I need it
for the sock hop tonight.

399
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:53,461
The sock hop.
Who'd dance with you?

400
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:57,065
All you have is a buck?
I'll have that.

401
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,001
Is this you?
Well, I take
a bad picture.

402
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:02,369
<i>Tell me about it.
(both) ugh.</i>

403
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,973
Listen, I'm gonna give you
a demerit.
What's a demerit?

404
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:09,442
If you get enough of 'em,
you wind up in Miss Togar's
office.

405
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:12,112
<i>(both) %% demerit, demerit
well, what for?</i>

406
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:14,981
<i>Because...
(both) ...You're ugly.</i>

407
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,983
Hit him now.
Hit him. Hit him.

408
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,252
I have a great idea.
Let's go monitor
the girls' gym.

409
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:20,753
All right.
Ok?

410
00:21:20,754 --> 00:21:22,989
<i>(muffled speech) </i>

00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,792

412
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:34,799
<i>(turns music off)
what are you doing, Riff?</i>

413
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,569
Gym class called
on account of boredom.

414
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,637
Got some of my homework
instead.

415
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:42,439
Homework?
Yeah, for Mr. Mcgree's
songwriting class.

416
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,475
I've written a song
for the Ramones.

417
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:46,943
<i>(%% rock)

447
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:11,405
Next I investigated reports
of loss of hearing
by individuals

448
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:13,874
Due to the high decibel level
involved

449
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,210
In playing
rock-'n'-roll music.

450
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:19,846
Put on these
ear protective devices,

451
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:21,915
As I am going to -
Mr. Mcgree -

452
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,184
Play a song by the Ramones

453
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,786
At the decibel level
consistent with that used

454
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:29,622
In your average concert.

455
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:31,724
Your standard mouse

456
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:33,726
And your standard speakers.

457
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:35,628
Now, back, back.

458
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:39,898
This is
the rock-o-meter.
Gee.

459
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:45,020
It is used to measure
comparative rock-'n'-roll
intensity levels.

460
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,856
Watch the mouse
while I turn it on.

461
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:49,791
<i>(%% "teenage lobotomy"

462

00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:25,490

I think they're trying
to tell us something.

478
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:35,015
Ok.

1, 2...

515
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:10,821
They're dancing.

516
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:13,389
Oh, no, Miss Togar,
it's calisthenics.

517
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,658
Where are their books?

518
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:18,427
This is a gym class.

519
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:21,797
They're exercising
their bodies.

520
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:23,432
1, 2...

521
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:27,437
What these girls need
is to exercise their minds.

522
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:29,671
1, 2...
3, 4.

523
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,872
1, 2...

524
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:33,608

she's crazy.

525
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:34,609

532
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:49,089
All right, girls.
Come on, let's go.

533
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,492
<i>(all) whoo!
(blowing weakly) </i>

534
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:09,608
Uh, Cheryl, do you think
Tom Roberts is cute?

535
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:11,910
Yeah,
but he's such a dork.

536
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:14,879
No, he's not.
I think he's a fox.

537
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,281
A fox?

538
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:19,951
Tom Roberts is so boring,
his brother is an only child.

539
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:22,453
He's not half as hot
as Joey Ramone.

540
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:23,787
Who's Joey Ramone?

541
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:25,889
Where have you been -
Mars?

542
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,825
Earth calling Kate.

543
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:31,095
He just happens
to be the lead singer
of the Ramones.

544
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:34,097
I wish we could
see them this Thursday
at their concert.

545
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:35,599
So what's stopping you?

546
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,435
We can't cut classes
to stand in line
for tickets.

547
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:40,437
That's right.
Oh, please.

548
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:42,939
Ten years from now,
no one will care

549
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,042
If you've ever been
to high school, much less
skipped a few classes.

550
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,877
You all act
as if everything's
so important around here.

551
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:51,213
Just because Togar
is stuck in the '50s

552
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:53,782
Doesn't mean
there isn't life
after high school.

553
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:56,252
I've got my own future
to think about.

554
00:27:56,253 --> 00:27:58,287
I know I can write
for the Ramones.

555
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:01,088
All I've gotta do
is get my songs to them.

556
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:03,157
They won't be in town
for another year,

557
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:05,159
So I've got to
see them now.

558
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,161
Hey, we wanna go
as much as you,

559
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:09,163
But we can't all
cut classes.

560
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:11,165
Well, I guess
it's up to me, then,

561
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,166
But you'll have to
cover for me, Kate.

562
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,702
I'm gonna take
a three-day leave
from Camp Lombardi

563
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:17,137
And be first in line.

564
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:19,973
If anyone wants to join me
at front-row center,

565
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:21,808
Why, you just let me know.

Hello, Mr. Eaglebauer.

605
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:03,457
How are you doing?
Great, thank you.

Please, sit down,

What can I do
for you, Kate?

Well, I wanna go out
on a date.

609
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:15,268
Say no more.
Eaglebauer enterprises
has a man for you.

610
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:19,522
Tell me, have you had
much experience with boys?

611
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:24,043
Well... Once I played nurse
with a boy next door

612
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:27,096
And got sued
for malpractice.

613
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:31,549
I wish part of Riff
would rub off on me.

614
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,368
Everything's so easy for her.

615
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:37,339
Did you have
any one particular person
in mind?

616
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,475
Well, I was kind of hoping

617
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:43,077
That you might fix me up
with...

618
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:45,095
With Tom Roberts.

619
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:48,432
Tom Roberts?
Yeah.

620
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:50,617
I love him.
He's a great guy.
I love him.

621
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,469
Well, can you do it?

622
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,020
This will never work.

623
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:57,256
Tom will never like me.
I don't know who I'm kidding.

624
00:31:57,257 --> 00:31:59,258
What possible reason
could there be

625
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:01,728
To put myself
through all this?

626
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:03,730
Sex.

627
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:06,265
I must admit,
as far as reasons go,

628
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:08,300
It must be one of the best.

629
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,836
Kate, I've known Tom
ever since he was a freshman,

630
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:12,805
When I sold him
his first touchdown.

631
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,708
Believe me, you're just
the type of girl he goes for.

Eaglebauer, what are we
doing up here?

635
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:31,555
I thought we were gonna
start training today.

636
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:33,641
This is the perfect spot
for it.

637
00:32:33,642 --> 00:32:36,075
Most romantic setting
in the city.

638
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:40,230
Just you, the skyline
and your training partner.

639
00:32:40,231 --> 00:32:43,433
Training partner?

640
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:45,135
Hi, Tom.

641
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:48,253
I was kind of expecting
Riff Randell.

642
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:51,273
Eaglebauer, I don't know
whether I can go through
with this.

643
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,375
Couldn't I just practice
with myself?

644
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:56,294
You done too much of that
already.
Yeah.

645
00:32:56,295 --> 00:33:00,232
Now, for the next three days,

646
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:03,935
You two are gonna have
nothing but fun.

647
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:07,505
Now, the first lesson -
necking.

648
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:12,143
The place - lovers' Lane.

00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:19,616
Well, you're young.

652
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:26,456
Now, what's the first thing
you guys do?

653
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:30,493

Now, this next step
can either make or break
a successful date.

657
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:34,051
One-handed approach
to strap unfastening

that must be mastered.

659

Now watch closely
as I demonstrate.

660
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:43,277
There's the hook.

661
00:34:43,278 --> 00:34:46,379
The snap.

662
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,781
There is the double hook.

663
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,084
There is
the dreaded minihooks.

664
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,439
And, if you play
your cards right,

665
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,325
The easy-open frontal assault.

666
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:26,315
Isn't it sad when a family
has to suffer so much?

667
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:28,384

It may have taken me
two million lawns to mow,

Look at all this stuff!

873
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:39,760
Color TV, stereo,
wet bar, waterbed!

874
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:42,429
I'll tell ya,
I never knew gettin' laid
was so expensive.

875
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,265
Ok, I hope I can remember
everything you taught me,
though.

876
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:46,767
Tom, you're nervous.

877
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:50,169
Here, have a drink.
It'll calm you down.

878
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,637
Thanks.

879
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:54,240
Hey, and whatever you do,
don't worry.

880
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:56,742
Since Riff lost her tickets
to the concert,

881
00:47:56,743 --> 00:47:58,727
You can move right in.

882
00:47:58,728 --> 00:48:00,629
She'll be a pushover.

883
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,965
Besides, look how far
you've come in three days.

884
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:06,968
Yeah, but the question is
how far will she go tonight?

885
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:12,306
"if the unknown is 'y'
and the binomial is 'x,'

886
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:16,794
What is the function
of the equation 'z'?"

887
00:48:18,513 --> 00:48:20,264
Riff.

888
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:22,349
Riff.

889
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,885
Riff!
Huh? Uh...

890
00:48:24,886 --> 00:48:26,854
Oh, uh, the, uh,

891
00:48:26,855 --> 00:48:30,590
The, uh, major export
of Ecuador is kapok.

892
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:33,959
Very good, but that's geography,
and this is calculus.

893
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,127
Ooh, sorry.

894
00:48:35,128 --> 00:48:37,763
Look at your math book.
It looks brand new.

895
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:39,882
I bet you've never
even opened it.

896
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,984
I only use it
on special equations.

studying tonight.

899

Yeah, I've gotta
get home, anyway.

900
00:48:49,675 --> 00:48:52,344
I'm expecting Tom
to call me tonight.

901
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:54,613
You really like him,
don't you?

902
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:57,348
Mm-hmm. I've been seeing
a lot of him lately.

903
00:48:57,349 --> 00:48:58,616
You have?
Mm-hmm.

904
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:00,618
Eaglebauer says we were made
for one another.

905
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:01,885
Oh, he did?

906
00:49:01,886 --> 00:49:04,921
I think tonight
could be pretty special.

She's on the line.

Great. Just remember
what I told you.

00:49:11,895 --> 00:49:15,765
Yeah. Hello. Hello, Riff?

00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:18,534
Hi. It's Tom.

<i>Tom?
Yeah, Tom Roberts.

914

No.

Oh, yeah. Hey, Kate,
it's Tom Roberts on the phone.

917
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:31,363
Tom? Why would he
call me here?

918
00:49:31,364 --> 00:49:32,865
So how's it been?

919
00:49:32,866 --> 00:49:34,316
Oh.

920
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:36,116
<i>Little dry lately.</i>

921
00:49:36,117 --> 00:49:39,820
Yeah,
but I hear it's raining
cats and dogs in Idaho.

922
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:44,524
Yes. Yes! Oh, man,
it's goin' great.

00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:46,560
<i>Great. (mutters) </i>

924
00:49:46,561 --> 00:49:49,729
Listen, I'm just lying here
in my new van,

925
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,915
On my beautiful waterbed,

926
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:54,651
Listening to the Ramones'
brand-new album

927
00:49:54,652 --> 00:49:57,453
On this fantastically
expensive stereo

928
00:49:57,454 --> 00:50:01,557
Wondering if you'd like to maybe
go out tonight and get drunk?

929
00:50:01,558 --> 00:50:03,392
All right.

930
00:50:03,393 --> 00:50:06,111
Listen, I really wish
you'd reconsider-- what?

931
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:08,313
Sure, I'll go out
with you tonight.

932
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:10,983
You can't do that.
He's mine.

933
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:12,234
You will?

934
00:50:12,235 --> 00:50:15,170
<i>Just find a date
for Kate, ok?</i>

935
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:20,608
Great, I will. Listen,
I'll pick you both up
in about an hour.

936
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:22,310
We got it!

937
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,478
Riff, how can you
go out with him?

938
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:28,048
I never thought about Tom
until you mentioned him.

939
00:50:28,049 --> 00:50:29,549
What?!

940
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,651
It'd be a change for me,
don't you think?

941
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:35,756
I never went in much
for the jock type.
Oh, cut it out.

942
00:50:35,757 --> 00:50:38,625
What about me?
What about tonight?

943
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:41,677
Don't worry. You'll
be in the back seat
with Eaglebauer.

944
00:50:41,678 --> 00:50:44,597
<i>He's lots of fun.
(gags) </i>

945
00:50:44,598 --> 00:50:47,033
I don't wanna have fun.
I wanna be with Tom.

946
00:50:47,034 --> 00:50:51,203
<i>(chuckles) hey,
I'm only kidding, Kate.</i>

947
00:50:51,204 --> 00:50:55,573
I wouldn't do that
to you, huh?

948
00:50:55,574 --> 00:50:57,575
I'll take care of Eaglebauer.

949
00:50:57,576 --> 00:51:00,412
You can have Tom
all to yourself.

950
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:02,948
Hmm?
Shouldn't kid like that,
Riff.

951
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:04,950
<i>(mocks) shouldn't
kid like that.</i>

952
00:51:04,951 --> 00:51:07,717
You know how hot I am
for him.
Hot?

953
00:51:07,718 --> 00:51:09,786
Yes, hot.
Whoa.

954
00:51:09,787 --> 00:51:13,290
"hot," off the lips of Kate.
My goodness. Ha-ha.

955
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,193
Ha-ha, we did it!
We did it.

956
00:51:16,194 --> 00:51:19,196
I got you a date
with Kate. Whoo-hoo.

957
00:51:19,197 --> 00:51:20,964
Hot equals Joey Ramone.

958
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:23,866
No, hot equals Tom.
Ehh.

959
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:27,770
Aw, I can't believe it.
I can't believe it was
that easy.

960
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:31,540
He looks like a little cherub
or something. Looks like
he's gonna fly away to Heaven.

961
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,459
He's so sweet-looking,
kinda like a cream puff.

962
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,561
That's why I like him.

963
00:51:36,562 --> 00:51:39,264
I like Joey Ramone 'cause
he's tall and handsome.

964
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:42,834
He looks like a poem to me.
A poem?

965
00:51:42,835 --> 00:51:46,387
We get them drunk,
we go in the back,
we hit the waterbed...

966
00:51:46,388 --> 00:51:48,389
We gotta take turns
in the back.

967
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,824
All he eats is pizza.

968
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:55,445
I just love the way
he holds the pizza
dripping above his mouth.

969
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,148
He slithers and slides it
into his mouth.

<i>It's so sexy the way it...

Great, great.

Oh, this is nice.

Kate, do you realize
they're all really brothers?

1057
00:56:00,072 --> 00:56:03,408
Imagine being the only sister
in the Ramones' family.

With the hottest band this side
of the iron curtain -

1071
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:40,926
The Ramones!

1072
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:43,395
<i>(man) you know it, Steve.</i>

1073
00:56:43,396 --> 00:56:46,231
<i>(woman)

1075
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:52,136
But first, I'd like to
introduce the two winners

1076
00:56:52,137 --> 00:56:54,038
Of the Charity ticket raffle

1077
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:57,091
Donated by the principal
of Vince Lombardi high!

1078
00:56:57,092 --> 00:56:59,460
<i>(man) Togar eats it!</i>

1079
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:01,862
<i>(woman yells) </i>

<i>(concert over radio)</i>

1082
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:15,624
Now, that's a step
in the right direction.

1083
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:18,861
And to keep this administration
moving forward,

1084
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:21,564
I've made a list
of new school policy,

1085
00:57:21,565 --> 00:57:25,200
Which I would like
instituted immediately.

1086
00:57:25,201 --> 00:57:27,769
Take this down.

1087
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:30,988
Girls - skirts
below their knees

1088
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:34,892
And boys' hair
above their collar.

1089
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:39,296
And I think it would be tidy
if they wore neckties.

1090
00:57:40,365 --> 00:57:42,633
And lunch is to be cut down

1091
00:57:42,634 --> 00:57:44,134
To half an hour

1092
00:57:44,135 --> 00:57:48,605
Because I am doubling up
on silent study hall.

1093
00:57:48,606 --> 00:57:53,059
Well, I think that
should teach them a lesson
in deportment.

1094
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,877
How do you spell that?

1095
00:57:54,878 --> 00:57:58,114
D-e-portment.

1096
00:57:58,115 --> 00:57:59,881
Now I want you to meet
the two winners

1097
00:57:59,882 --> 00:58:02,718
Of the screamin' Steve
ticket contest -

1098
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:05,553
Riff Randell
and Kate Rambeau!

<i>(all) yay, Riff!</i>

1101
00:58:08,724 --> 00:58:10,725
You're live
on the air, girls.

1102
00:58:10,726 --> 00:58:13,994
Why don't you say a few words
to the folks at home? Go.

1103
00:58:13,995 --> 00:58:17,298
On behalf of the students
from Vince Lombardi high
who are here tonight,

1104
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:19,566
I'd just like to say
one thing -

1105
00:58:19,567 --> 00:58:23,820
Screw you, principal Togar.
We made it to the concert,
anyway! Yeah!

1106
00:58:23,821 --> 00:58:29,243
Who says today's youth
has nothin' to say, huh?

1107
00:58:29,244 --> 00:58:32,529
<i>(inaudible yelling) </i>

1108
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:35,715
Those girls have turned
the whole school against me.

1109
00:58:35,716 --> 00:58:38,067
Hansel, Gretel.

1110
00:58:38,068 --> 00:58:41,003
I want you to crash
that concert.

1111
00:58:41,004 --> 00:58:44,223
I want Randell and Rambeau
brought back here immediately.

1112
00:59:13,951 --> 00:59:16,686
So you're Kate Rambeau, huh?
Yeah.

1113
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:19,822
<i>I just loved your latest
scientific American.</i>

1114
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:21,524
Thanks.

1115
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:23,925
Hey, would you two
lovely ladies

1116
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:26,161
Like to see
screamin' Steve in action

1117
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,446
As he interviews
the Ramones?

1118
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:31,583
Oh, great. I know
just the questions to ask.

1119
00:59:31,584 --> 00:59:33,585
That's beautiful, 'cause
I can't think of a thing.

1120
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:37,154
I've waited so long
to see them. I know
they're gonna love my songs.

1121
00:59:37,155 --> 00:59:39,590
I can believe it.
Ya ready? Here we go.

1122
00:59:40,825 --> 00:59:43,761
Hey, you wanna keep it down
out here?

1123
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:46,197
They're tuning up.
How'd you get in there?

1124
00:59:46,198 --> 00:59:50,300
Professional secret.
What's this stuff?

1125
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:55,121
Stuff is gonna prove
to the Ramones that I can
write songs for them,

1126
00:59:55,122 --> 00:59:57,123
So out of my way, dew drop.

1127
00:59:57,124 --> 01:00:01,160
I'm sorry, but
the Ramones' manager,

1128
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:03,161
A personal
friend of mine,

1129
01:00:03,162 --> 01:00:05,897
Put me in charge
of keeping everyone out.

1130
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:08,734
What's all the trouble,
Angel, baby, huh?

1131
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:10,736
Screamin'.
Well...

1132
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:13,472
Good to see ya.
Long time, right?

1133
01:00:13,473 --> 01:00:15,774
Uh, who are these two?

1134
01:00:15,775 --> 01:00:18,743
These are screamin' Steve's
contest winners.

1135
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:21,796
Oh, uh, sorry, girls,
you'll have to wait outside.

1136
01:00:21,797 --> 01:00:23,798
Oh, man...
Can't we just watch?

1137
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:29,386
Angel dearest, why don't you
see these sweet young things
to their seats?

1138
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:33,157
We'll go ourselves,
thanks.

1139
01:00:33,158 --> 01:00:35,759
It's gonna be ok. Yeah.

1140
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,862
Screamin', I was wondering
if you could give us
a little more airtime.

1141
01:00:38,863 --> 01:00:40,864
I'm hittin' it
once an hour.

1142
01:00:40,865 --> 01:00:42,798
You can do
a little better.

1357
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:09,076
Ok. Ok, girlie, the boys'll
take a look at 'em

1358
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,878
And get back to you
tomorrow, huh?

1359
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,363
Yeah, we're gonna be in town
one more day,

1360
01:14:13,364 --> 01:14:16,049
And if we like 'em,
we'll come pay you
and Mr. Mcglibb a visit.

1361
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:18,618
Say hi to Vince
for us.
Oh, wow.

1362
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:22,556
This is the happiest day
of my life.

1363
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:26,592

<i>(birds chirping) </i>

1365

And I say to you parents,

1366
01:14:37,554 --> 01:14:40,805
This high school
is a failure.

1367
01:14:40,806 --> 01:14:44,275
The past semester
has been a black Mark

1368
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:48,446
On the proud tradition
of Vince Lombardi high.

1369
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:53,350
Student Riff Randell alone
has disrupted classes...

1370
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:56,136
They can't say I haven't
contributed anything.

1371
01:14:56,137 --> 01:14:58,372
...And banded the students
against me

1372
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:01,792
To attend a concert
of the Ramones.

1373
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:04,094
Hey, yeah!
That's right.

1374
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:08,130
...That awful
rock and roll music.

1375
01:15:08,131 --> 01:15:12,301
You see before you
my first major step

1376
01:15:12,302 --> 01:15:15,705
In putting this school
back on the winning track.

1377
01:15:15,706 --> 01:15:18,124
I give you...

1378
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,458
The final solution.

1379
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:21,843

01:15:21,844 --> 01:15:23,844

<i>(boy) we've gotta stop her!</i>

1385
01:15:37,476 --> 01:15:39,777
Somebody stop her!
She can't do that!

1386
01:15:39,778 --> 01:15:41,011
<i>(boy #2) hey!</i>

1387
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:50,286
Miss Togar,

1388
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:53,706
I cannot stand by
and allow you to do this.

1389
01:15:53,707 --> 01:15:55,492
Then stand aside,
Mr. Mcgree.

1390
01:15:55,493 --> 01:15:57,443
Let me through.

1391
01:15:57,444 --> 01:15:59,878
<i>(Eaglebauer) she's
burning our records!
We gotta stop her!</i>

1392
01:15:59,879 --> 01:16:01,763

1393

Togar!

1394
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:13,141
That's the last straw, Randell.

1395
01:16:13,142 --> 01:16:14,825
Detention... For life!

Hey, come on, you guys.
Follow me into the school.

1406
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:57,632
I regret that I have
only one life to give
for rock-'n'-roll.

1407
01:16:57,633 --> 01:17:01,269
You belong in school with us,
Mr. Mcgree. Come on.

1408
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:05,021
Things sure have changed
since we got kicked out
of high school.

1409
01:17:05,022 --> 01:17:08,158
Oh. Where are you going?
To Mr. Mcgree's class.

1410
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,694
Well, I'm happy
to see some students
still are interested

1411
01:17:10,695 --> 01:17:12,496
In their studies.

1412
01:17:12,497 --> 01:17:14,498
We're not students.
We're the Ramones.

1413
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:18,167
Ramones? You're responsible
for making that horrible
rock-'n'-roll music?

1414
01:17:18,168 --> 01:17:20,636

<i>(cheering) </i>

1524
01:23:18,233 --> 01:23:21,069
Attention!
Give it to me.

1525
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:22,836
Attention, students.

1526
01:23:24,456 --> 01:23:25,790
<i>(Togar) attention, students.</i>

1527
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:28,392
Hey, quiet!
Quiet, everybody! Listen!

1528
01:23:28,393 --> 01:23:32,296
This is your principal -
Miss Evelyn Togar!

1529
01:23:32,297 --> 01:23:35,032
I wanna speak
to Riff Randell.

1530
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:38,368
Quiet! Come on.
Into my office.

1531
01:23:38,369 --> 01:23:40,403
I don't think
it's working.

1532
01:23:40,404 --> 01:23:42,606
I know how to...
You don't think it's working?

1533
01:23:42,607 --> 01:23:46,242
Start talking, Togar.
It's your dime.

1534
01:23:46,243 --> 01:23:49,778
Ok, Randell. I know we've had
our differences in the past,

1535
01:23:49,779 --> 01:23:52,614
But I think it's time we tried
to understand one another.

1536
01:23:52,615 --> 01:23:55,100
I think the problem is clear.

1537
01:23:55,101 --> 01:23:58,804
I am a reasonable,
well-educated, mature
adult member of society,

1538
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:04,008
And you are a spoiled
heathen punk who has
taken over my school.

1539
01:24:04,009 --> 01:24:06,376
<i>(applause) </i>

1540
01:24:13,685 --> 01:24:15,885
So let's make a deal.

1541
01:24:15,886 --> 01:24:19,222
I can have you expelled
and turned over to the police.

1542
01:24:19,223 --> 01:24:21,791
But I'm gonna
forget about that

1543
01:24:21,792 --> 01:24:24,794
And just put one black Mark
on your permanent record

1544
01:24:24,795 --> 01:24:27,514
That will follow you throughout
the rest of your life...

1545
01:24:27,515 --> 01:24:29,698
<i>(all murmur) </i>

1546
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:32,634
...If you'll just
come out of there right now.

1547
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:35,821
<i>(all protest) </i>

1548
01:24:35,822 --> 01:24:40,392
I don't think one more
black Mark is gonna make
too much of a difference.

1549
01:24:40,393 --> 01:24:44,462
Eaglebauer, your partner,
comes through again.
All right.

1550
01:24:47,933 --> 01:24:50,101
<i>(screams) </i>

1551
01:24:50,102 --> 01:24:54,538
Here's what I think about
your school records, Togar!

1552
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:58,575
You handled that very well,
Miss Togar.

1553
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,650
What's that?

1554
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:11,220
I don't know. I...

1555
01:25:11,221 --> 01:25:13,155
Miss Togar!

1556
01:25:13,156 --> 01:25:15,725
<i>(both yelling) </i>

1557
01:25:24,467 --> 01:25:29,070
Well, now they've done it.
Destroying government property.

1558
01:25:29,071 --> 01:25:32,574
I think ya failed,
Miss Togar. I think we're
gonna have to do it my way.

1559
01:25:32,575 --> 01:25:35,142
I think you're right.

1560
01:25:35,143 --> 01:25:38,145
Randell, I just talked
to the chief of police.

1561
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:41,549
You're not out in five minutes,
he's going to Storm
the building.

1562
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:43,383
Well, you heard it, folks.

1563
01:25:43,384 --> 01:25:46,619
Miss Togar has just
given the students
of rock-'n'-roll high

1564
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:47,954
An ultimatum.

1565
01:25:47,955 --> 01:25:52,024
A classic confrontation
between mindless authority

1566
01:25:52,025 --> 01:25:54,360
And the rebellious
nature of youth.

1567
01:25:54,361 --> 01:25:57,630
The moment of truth
is at hand. What will
these kids do next?

1568
01:26:19,751 --> 01:26:21,719
Boy, this sure is
rock-'n'-roll high school.

1569
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,622
Yeah, we liked it so much,
we're gonna play it
on our next album.

1570
01:26:24,623 --> 01:26:28,424
To show our appreciation,
we're gonna make you
an honorary Ramone.

1571
01:26:28,425 --> 01:26:31,044
<i>(students cheering) </i>

1572
01:26:31,045 --> 01:26:32,846
<i>(girl yells) </i>

1573
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:37,250
Hey, guys, people say
that your music is loud

1574
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:40,136
And destructive
and lethal to mice,

1575
01:26:40,137 --> 01:26:43,389
But I think you're
the Beethovens of our time.

1576
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:45,357
That was a good one,
Mr. Mcgree.

1577
01:26:55,634 --> 01:26:58,569
<i>(timer ticking) </i>

1578
01:27:08,112 --> 01:27:10,447
Kate, is it a go?
It's a go.

1579
01:27:10,448 --> 01:27:13,183
All right!
Everybody follow me.
We're gonna evacuate.

1580
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:15,602
I guess we should
rush the building.

1581
01:27:17,438 --> 01:27:18,671
Not so fast. Look.

1582
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:24,276
They're coming out.

1583
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,280
It's over.

1584
01:27:28,281 --> 01:27:30,082
We won.

1585
01:27:30,968 --> 01:27:33,768
Ladies and gentlemen,
school is out.

1586
01:27:33,769 --> 01:27:37,205
It appears as if the final bell
has rung for these students.

1587
01:27:37,206 --> 01:27:39,674
Has Riff Randell given up?

1588
01:27:39,675 --> 01:27:41,843
Has she and her
fellow classmates

1589
01:27:41,844 --> 01:27:44,878
Failed Miss Togar’s
final exam?

1590
01:27:44,879 --> 01:27:47,614
Is this the end
of rock-'n'-roll high?

1591
01:27:47,615 --> 01:27:51,018
Just what do you
have to say for yourself,
young lady?

1592
01:27:51,019 --> 01:27:54,321
I have seen the errors
of my ways.

1593
01:27:54,322 --> 01:27:58,457
I'd just like to say
to all students everywhere

1594
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:01,795
That you may think the school
is yours for a while,

1595
01:28:01,796 --> 01:28:05,865
But it's always
run by the principal
and her administration.

1596
01:28:05,866 --> 01:28:07,300
That's nice.

1597
01:28:07,301 --> 01:28:09,869
Vince Lombardi high is...

1598
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:13,255
Is your school, Miss Togar,

1599
01:28:13,256 --> 01:28:15,190
So you can have it.

1600
01:28:15,191 --> 01:28:18,510
Well, I'm very happy to see
that you've come to your senses.

1601
01:28:18,511 --> 01:28:20,813
And what would you have done
with the school, anyway?

1602
01:28:20,814 --> 01:28:24,098
Rock the roof off it.
Hit it, Marky!
