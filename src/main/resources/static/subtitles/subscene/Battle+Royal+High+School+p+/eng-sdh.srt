00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:14,885
(Griff) They're not at
school here anymore.

172
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:16,428
Are you in school here?

173
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,763
Yeah.

174
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:19,807
First day, huh?

175
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,183
No, not really. I was--

176
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:24,854
Mine, too. I'm a new teacher, Mr.
Clark. What's your name?

177
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:26,480
Griff. Griff McReynolds.

178
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:28,357
Oh, nice to meet you, Griff.

179
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,069
You know, son, I remember
my first day at school.

180
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,114
Hope you live
through this one, chump.

181
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:37,032
<i>(woman on speaker)
Your attention, please.</i>

182
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:39,159
<i>Today begins
Sexual Awareness Week.</i>

183
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:41,328
<i>Please contact Nurse
Johnson in the hall.</i>

184
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:44,123
Here you go, you little slut.

185
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,625
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Room 134.

186
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,295
Thank you.

187
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:52,464
<i>Keep moving.
I repeat, keep moving.</i>

188
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,758
<i>Pick up that can.</i>

189
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:57,636
<i>Where are you going? The little
girls' room is that way.</i>

190
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,222
<i>Hey, take off those colours.</i>

191
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,641
<i>Yeah, you.
Lose the cigarette.</i>

192
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:06,979
<i>Take a hike, Gumby.</i>

193
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,647
<i>Get rid of the sunglasses.</i>

194
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:11,609
Excuse me.
But this kind of behaviour...

195
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,778
Well, I'd bet the principal would
frown on this sort of thing.

196
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,906
Evelyn Doyle, Principal.

197
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:21,118
Look, pinhead, I don't know what
nursery school you come from,

198
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:23,204
but, here,
you screw up, you die.

199
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:27,249
Every bad kid in the city
is dumped into our laps.

200
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,668
Excuse me, Ms. Doyle,
with all due respect,

201
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:31,921
I don't think there is
such a thing as a bad kid.

202
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:33,756
At least, they don't
start off that way.

203
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,716
They just need
someone they can relate to

204
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,512
and I can reach them. I know
what's def, what's wack,

205
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,014
what's jam,
what's straight-up booty.

206
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:45,518
Mr. Clark, how long have
you been teaching here?

207
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:47,478
20 minutes!

208
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:49,647
I've been here over 20 years.

209
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:52,566
Don't you question
my authority on this.

210
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,026
Excuse me.

211
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,907
Pardon me.

212
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,368
Are you having a hard time
finding your way around?

213
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,245
Yes. I'm looking

214
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:06,455
for Room 134.

215
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:09,333
Hi. Victoria Chapell.

216
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,751
Richard Clark.

217
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:14,046
Nice to meet you, Mr. Clark.
It's down this way.

218
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,882
What do you teach,
Ms. Chapell?

219
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:20,135
I'm Principal Doyle's
administrative assistant.

220
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:24,348
Drama coach.
You did say Room 134?

221
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:25,975
Yep.

222
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:28,811
(Victoria)
Well, this is it.

223
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:31,564
All of our classrooms
are in dire need of repair.

224
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,566
Ever since
the legislature passed

225
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,442
that "three F's and
you're out" law

226
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:37,319
a lot of schools have closed.

227
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:40,322
The school board decided
it just wasn't worth it.

228
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:43,242
I guess they just
gave up on these kids.

229
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:46,495
So we've been squeezed
for money ever since.

230
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,205
We've been forced to--

231
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:49,665
[crashing]

232
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:50,791
Ooh.

233
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:55,713
Guess I'll get that later.

234
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:59,550
Mr. Clark, are you by any chance
related to Thaddeus Clark,

235
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,302
Headmaster at
the Wellington School?

236
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,762
Yeah. Yeah, he's my father.

237
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:07,850
Every school in the district uses
his book as a faculty primer.

238
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:10,853
You know, I don't see
the family resemblance.

239
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:13,731
Most people think I
take after my mum.

240
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:15,858
(Richard)
Look at this place.

241
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:16,984
[gasping]

242
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,320
Boy, it has great character.

243
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:22,281
Sure, it needs
a little paint and plaster...

244
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:26,535
and floorboards...

245
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,162
[groaning]

246
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:29,914
[rats squeaking]

247
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,334
And pest control.

248
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:35,336
But a little elbow grease...

249
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:37,254
[electric buzzing]
[whimpering]

250
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,215
[gasping]

251
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:40,424
Yow!

252
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:41,717
Jesus!

253
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:46,138
...and some new wiring, and she'll
be back to shape in no time.

254
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,892
Smell those seats.

255
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:54,939
It says, "Teach me.
I want to learn."

256
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:59,318
You must think I'm
a silly idealist.

257
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,070
No. No.

258
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,490
I really admire
your dedication.

259
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,744
Your wife must be
very proud of you.

260
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:11,163
Actually, I'm not married.

261
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:13,874
I find that surprising.

262
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,794
It's pretty
hard to be married,

263
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:18,796
if you've never had
a steady girlfriend.

264
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,717
I'm much too busy with work to think
about much else other than work.

265
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,638
That's very admirable.

266
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:32,852
The last time I heard someone
talk like that was old Mr. Riley.

267
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:36,188
He was head of the History
Department until last semester.

268
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:37,731
Retired?

269
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,526
If you can call being
beaten to death retiring.

270
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:41,861
Coffee?

271
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:43,863
[school bell ringing]

272
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,826
(Victoria)
The lounge.

273
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:53,706
(boy #1)
I'm going in. Cover me.

274
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,416
(boy #2)
Good luck in Home Ec., Lou.

275
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:03,174
It's a little early to start
drinking, don't you think?

276
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:04,633
Who stops?

277
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:12,892
Hi, I'm Richard Clark. I'm a
new history teacher here.

278
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:17,271
What department
do you teach in?

279
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:19,857
I don't know.
Something on the third floor.

280
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,320
Richard, I'd like
you to meet somebody.

281
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:28,407
This is Bernie Raveling,
our athletic director, and...

282
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,409
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Mr. Raveling.

283
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:32,745
Letting
the moustache grow in, I see.

284
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:33,913
Richard--

285
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:35,289
From the looks
of the stubble,

286
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:36,790
I'd say it's
going to be a beaut.

287
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:38,584
I had one in college myself.

288
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:42,213
Richard, that's Ms. Wells,
the girls' gym teacher.

289
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,927
Did I mention how attractive
you look, Ms. Wells?

290
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,472
That blue sweat suit really brings
out the colour of your eyes.

291
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,058
You coming on to me,
pickle dick?

292
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,101
No. I'd never dream of it.

293
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:58,521
Oh. Not good enough for you?

294
00:14:58,604 --> 00:15:00,814
Well,
it's been a real pleasure.

295
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,483
[bell ringing]

296
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:06,195
They should really fix
the lighting in here.

297
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,745
<i>(Evelyn) All right,
settle down, you people.</i>

298
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,456
<i>Knock it off. Quiet!</i>

299
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:19,834
<i>I want quiet.</i>

300
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,085
[horn blaring]

301
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,257
<i>It's a new semester.
That means new I.D. cards</i>

302
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,551
[interpreters speaking

303
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,511
<i>Strip searches and

304
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:32,763
Shut up!

305
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,562
<i>Now, as you know, Mr. Amott,</i>

306
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:42,982
<i>our Assistant Principal,
is still missing.</i>

307
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:46,360
<i>If you know of his whereabouts,
or if you have him,</i>

308
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:49,029
<i>contact me immediately.</i>

309
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:52,241
<i>And also don't forget,
in less than 2 months</i>

310
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:55,995
<i>the state will administer
the Academic Proficiency Test.</i>

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,220
<i>AH right, listen up!</i>

317
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,306
<i>We have a new teacher.</i>

318
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:17,516
<i>His name is Richard Clark.</i>

319
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,393
<i>It's his first day.</i>

320
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:24,106
<i>Give him at least a week before
you do something terrible to him.</i>

321
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,775
<i>Mr. Clark,
do you have anything to say?</i>

322
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,527
<i>Now, you all should know--</i>

323
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,404
A-a-actually, yes.

324
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:32,907
[groaning]

325
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:37,953
<i>I was asked a while back,
what teaching meant to me.</i>

326
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:42,750
<i>My reward, is being
able to shape and mould</i>

<i>Someday you will be

329
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:54,887
<i>But the important
thing is, I see in you</i>

330
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,181
<i>the future of America.</i>

331
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,266

You suck!

336
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:21,497

please settle down.

There. That's more like it.

340
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:35,970
I know.

341
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,763
I'm the enemy.

342
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,890
I'm the "grown-up."

343
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:44,270
But, darn it,
I was a kid once, too.

344
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,731
And I haven't led
a choirboy's life.

345
00:17:47,815 --> 00:17:50,526
I've got my share of
parking tickets. Whoa.

346
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:53,112
At a baseball game once,

347
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:57,616
I moved down to
the expensive seats.

348
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,537
Yeah. I'm not proud of it.

349
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:05,249
Now, in order to get
to know you,

350
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,459
I've devised a little system.

351
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:09,086
When I call your name,

352
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,130
I would like you to stand up

353
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:14,800
and then you tell me a little
something about yourself.

354
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:16,886
[sighing]

355
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:18,846
Natalie Thompson.

356
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:21,182
Is there
a Natalie Thompson here?

357
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:22,808
I'm here, here.

358
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:24,018
What's up, gin?

359
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:25,186
Why are you late?

360
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,771
Because the bell
rang before I got here.

361
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:29,440
<i>Well--</i>

00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:34,820
All right. Before you
came in,

364
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:37,239
we were just talking about
sharing personal information.

365
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:39,783
Perhaps you can tell us
something about yourself.

366
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:43,204
For the last week, I've had a yeast
infection that's extremely--

367
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:45,039
Not that personal.

368
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:48,042
Something about
what you enjoy doing.

369
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,793
I like writing poetry.

370
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:53,422
(Richard)
A poet. I love poetry.

371
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:56,759
Perhaps you have a nice one
you'd like to share with us.

372
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:58,010
Okay.

373
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,598
Here's one I wrote yesterday.

374
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,684
"Oh, hopelessness,

381
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,544
That's as far as I got.
I would have finished but

382
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,548
I couldn't find anything to rhyme
with "festering drippage."

Anferny, I thought I
wrote it down wrong.

390

All right. Tell us a little
something about yourself, Anferny.

391
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:03,617
Well, you know,
I like chilling with my boys,

That's Mrs. Rubels.

of prison, I met Tito,

Not bad. Not bad at all.

give me a ride home?

misplaced my car.

00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,841
Dim sum.

519
00:26:33,924 --> 00:26:36,343
Whenever I'm feeling
overwhelmed by life,

520
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,220
I just head to Chinatown.

521
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:40,764
Yo, Mr. Clark, Paco and
his boys heading up in here.

522
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:42,933
You want us
to serve them fools?

523
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:47,271
Look. Anferny,
instead of using your fists

524
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,398
try using this.

525
00:26:49,481 --> 00:26:51,025
Head-butting?

526
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:53,110
Never mind.

527
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:54,695
Just pick
a window and guard it.

528
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:56,864
Richard, you're not really
going to try and stop

529
00:26:56,947 --> 00:26:58,866
Paco and his gang
from coming in, are you?

530
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,159
They come to all the dances.

531
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:01,452
Not anymore.

532
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:04,705
What if they got guns and
knives and everything?

533
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:07,583
Who'd bring guns
and knives to a dance?

534
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,335
[guns clicking]

535
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:12,671
In that case, maybe we'd
better call the police.

536
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:14,548
No, wait. The last
time they tried that,

537
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,634
4 people ended up
in the hospital.

538
00:27:17,384 --> 00:27:18,761
I can see your point.

539
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:20,721
W-we can't have kids
going to the hospital.

540
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:24,141
Who said anything about kids?
The cops were beaten senseless.

541
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,935
[all chuckling]

542
00:27:26,018 --> 00:27:27,186
All right.

543
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:29,396
You take care of the music.
Anferny,

544
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,315
you and your guys,
you come with me.

545
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:33,108
Let's go.

546
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:39,907
Say, nice leather jacket.

547
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,033
Men's Warehouse?

548
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:44,829
Shut up, teach. We're
coming in, so stand aside.

549
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,664
Not this time, gentlemen.

550
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,582
This dance is for
Barry students only.

551
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,585
We're not gonna have any
gangs inside our school.

552
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,878
Who's gonna stop us?

553
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:54,255
My gang-

554
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:56,799
We already up
inside the school.

555
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:58,926
You call them bunch
of pussies a gang?

556
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,887
Look, Paco, if you're interested
in coming back to school

557
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,181
and working towards a career.
Shut up!

558
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,016
(Paco)
Are you gonna move aside

559
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,686
or am I gonna have to turn your
eyebrows into a moustache?

560
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:10,312
(Griff)
Paco,

561
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:13,232
why don't you chill out, man?

562
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:15,401
Stay out of this, Griff.

563
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,112
Since when you
been down with O.P.P?

564
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:19,572
What you tripping about?

565
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:20,865
You with my girl.

566
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:22,825
I'm not your girl, Paco.

567
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,160
Since when?

568
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:25,911
We went on one date.

569
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,330
If I had known you were gonna
rob that liquor store,

570
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:30,166
trust me,
I never would have gone.

571
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:31,625
No one got hurt, did they?

572
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,670
Only 'cause the clerk was
wearing a bulletproof turban.

573
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:36,547
All right, that's enough.

574
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,091
Fine. I don't want you
anyway, you super freak.

575
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,010
You're a real jack-off,
you know that?

576
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,262
[all shouting]

577
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,765
That's enough. I mean it.

578
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:49,852
Look, we're all civilised
human beings here.

579
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:52,146
Certainly we can come up
with a compromise.

580
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:55,149
All right.
I just got some fresh wheels.

581
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:57,276
How about a chickee run?

582
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,570
You're a real idiot,
you know?

583
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,530
That's good. Chickee run.

584
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,990
Isn't that
better than fighting?

585
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:05,659
Okay, everybody, let's go.
Back to dancing.

586
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,620
And we'll see you in, what?

587
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:10,164
10 minutes. Beck's Bluff.

588
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:11,499
[all chanting]
See you at the Bluff.

589
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,292
Thanks, pal.

590
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,669
[all chanting]
Chickee run.

591
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:22,301
See? There's always an intelligent
way to solve our differences.

592
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:25,888
My God, Richard, do you have any
idea what you've just done?

593
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,941
Get lost, punk.

594
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:38,484
[whimpering]

595
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:45,574
[crowd chanting]
Chickee run!

596
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:47,368
All right.

597
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,870
First one to
jump out of the car

598
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:52,581
before the edge
of the cliff loses.

599
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,043
(Natalie) Now remember,
no ramming, no swerving,

600
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:59,171
and absolutely no use
of brakes at any time.

601
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:02,299
All right, listen up, guys.
Here's the deal.

602
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,468
When I drop this scarf

603
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,887
you boys are gonna go.

604
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,889
N°jumping the gun.

605
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,433
Ready...

606
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,646
[moaning]

607
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:19,608
Set...

608
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,655
[panting]

609
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:29,201
[hissing]

610
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,787
Se!

611
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,873
[zooming]

612
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:42,089
[engines revving]

613
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,850
(Victoria) Richard, just
promise me you'll be careful.

614
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:55,728
Remember some
things are irreplaceable.

615
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:57,313
Irreplaceable?

616
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,023
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

617
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:04,278
I was talking about my car!

618
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,955
Hey.

619
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,416
[honking]

620
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:22,421
Griff. Paco.
Listen to me, boys.

621
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,840
Going fast never
solved anything.

622
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,426
This is no way to
resolve a dispute.

623
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,470
We can work this mess out.

624
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:31,847
I want you both to get out
of your cars right now

625
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,725
and we'll settle
this in an adult manner,

626
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:36,560
like a fistfight.

627
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:44,985
There. That's better.

628
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,725
[crashing]

629
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:19,562
[groaning]

630
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,691
Nobody panic.

631
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,193
I'm okay.

632
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,070
Here's the tip.

633
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,489
Nobody has to
know about this.

634
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,700
It's our little secret.

635
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,451
[loud explosion]

636
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,132
<i>(female newsreader) Firefighters
from all over Southern California</i>

637
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:50,342
<i>are still trying to
contain the flames</i>

638
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,636
<i>that have
blackened over 200 acres</i>

639
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,139
<i>and caused several blocks
of homes to be evacuated.</i>

640
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,976
<i>The charred remains of three
cars were found in the rubble.</i>

641
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:02,479
<i>One, a classic Corvette,
has been described by experts</i>

642
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,607
<i>as being irreplaceable.</i>

643
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:09,653
I think we've heard enough
bad news for one day.

644
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,655
What we've been
hearing are rumours

645
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,451
that some of our students may
have been involved in this fire.

646
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:17,411
And very possibly, a teacher.

647
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,537
[gasping]

648
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,125
Now, you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you, Mr. Clark?

649
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,002
No.

650
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,962
You know, Clark,

651
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,717
I've been thinking that maybe
we got off on the wrong foot.

652
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,637
I happen to be a woman
who has strong opinions

653
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,515
about how this
place should be run.

654
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:41,310
It's just possible that you
and I don't see eye-to-eye

655
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:43,854
on our
philosophies of education.

656
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,650
I've always been
a woman of few words.

657
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,110
No miracles.

658
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,071
Dumping ground.

659
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,032
I'll need more
words than that, ma'am.

660
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,826
[sighing]

661
00:33:57,451 --> 00:34:00,079
All right.
I'll spell it out for you.

662
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:03,040
Our primary job here

663
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,501
is to warehouse
these delinquents,

664
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,087
until such time as
they can be released

665
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,422
into the general population

666
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,633
or sent to a real jail.

667
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:17,596
Look, although I may admire and
even appreciate your ideals,

668
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,015
I know what works, Mr. Clark.

669
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,143
I know what to
expect from these kids

670
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,938
and they know what
to expect from me.

671
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:31,110
My hope is that you can fit
into the pattern here at Barry.

672
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:34,029
I guess I should get to class.

673
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:37,199
Well, I've certainly
enjoyed our chat

674
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:40,870
and I'll take everything
you've said to heart.

675
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,038
Clark!

676
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,623
Mr. Clark...

677
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,837
Chickee run, man. Yeah.

678
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,505
Mr. Clark,
you were smoking last night.

679
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,257
Thanks, Anferny.

680
00:34:54,216 --> 00:34:55,467
My man!

681
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,346
For you, Mr. Clark.

682
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,016
Richard,
you forgot your briefcase.

683
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,227
How sweet. Is that for me?

684
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,771
Sorry about your car.

685
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,572
[can opening]

686
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,120
[bell ringing]

687
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,458
All right.
I want everyone to take their

688
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,002
seats.

689
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,965
Today,
I'd like to talk about...

690
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,140
All right. I guess I
won't need this anymore.

691
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,646
Well, let's begin, shall we?

692
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,441
Yesterday, I was about to
start with the Bill of Rights

693
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,944
and what they
mean to all of us.

694
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,531
Who can tell me about the Founding

It's all my fault.

by attacking you

You have to be careful.

If you raise
their expectations,

dreams, and then you fail?

00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,387
It's worth the risk.

00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,867
Scores will be posted
at the end of this week.

1044
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:13,000
(Natalie) So, how do you
think you did on the test?

1045
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,252
I don't know.
For the first time in my life,

1046
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:16,795
I feel like I did
something right.

1047
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:17,963
Me, too.

1048
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:19,215
Oh, check this out.

1049
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:20,466
What is it?

1050
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,592
It's my future.

1051
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,761
Remember that college
I was telling you about?

1052
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:24,929
Yeah.

1053
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,222
They wrote me back
yesterday.

1054
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,348
Yeah.

1055
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,642
Now I feel like I got
a real chance to get in.

1056
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,102
Guess I owe a lot
to Mr. Clark, huh?

1057
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,729
Yeah, you know,
I think all the kids

1058
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:35,689
pretty much
feel the same way.

1059
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,441
I mean, think about it.

1060
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:40,736
We could both end up
at the same school together.

1061
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,987
Oh, Griff,

1062
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:44,448
this is the happiest
lever remember being.

1063
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,617
It's the first time in my life
I haven't prayed

1064
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,661
for a gas line to rupture
under my building

1065
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,371
while I was smoking.

1066
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:53,582
Natalie, I'm glad
you're happy.

1067
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,752
Come on. There's somethin'
I want you to see.

1068
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:57,920
Okay.

1069
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,215
(Griff) Mr. Clark has taken this
place on as a special project.

1070

1072
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:10,307

thought the old man

"Who would have
thought the old man

1076
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,647

00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,321

Take it off!

1079
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,955
Hustle up, man.
Come on, hurry up.

1080
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,917
Yeah, sweet.

1081
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,963
This ought to take care
of our little problem.

1082
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,215
Let's get
out of here, Paco.

I just want to say

1088
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,648
before the test scores arrive

1089
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:04,320
that I am so proud
of all of you.

1090
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,746
Well?

1091
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,331

But there must be
some mistake.

00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:25,925
(Evelyn)
That's right.

1097
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:28,469
And you're it.
See for yourself.

Figures don't lie.

1099
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,974
We're not dealing
with Rhodes scholars here.

1100
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:36,101
It's time
I just accepted what I am

1101
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:37,937
and get on with my life.

1102
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,357
No, G riff, wait.

1103
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,693
(Evelyn)
See what you've done?

1104
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,279
I told you to leave them
at the bottom of the barrel,

1105
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:48,948
where they belong.

1106
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,324
Griff, wait.

1107
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:54,787

Chuckie, wait.

1110
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:03,462
Wait, Ms. Doyle, you're
making a huge mistake.

1111
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:05,214
Mr. Clark has helped
this school.

1112
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,507
He's a good teacher.

1113
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,760
And I'm not just saying that
because we slept together.

Richard, wait.

1117
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:29,280
No.

1118
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,824
You were right all along.

1119
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,534
I didn't know
what I was getting into

1120
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,952
with these kids.

1121
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,622
Oh, Richard.

1122
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,502
I'm out of here.

1123
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,380
What's wrong with all of you?

1124
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,466
Have you forgotten how much
Mr. Clark has helped us?

1125
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,510
You. You had a D average

1126
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,429
before Mr. Clark
started tutoring you.

1127
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,598
Now you're on the honour roll.

1128
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:56,765
And this boy.

1129
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,767
Everyone thought
he had Tourette's syndrome

1130
00:57:58,851 --> 00:57:59,977
until Mr. Clark discovered

1131
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,562
he was a Hindu
exchange student.

You can come back.

I'm living proof.

00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,887
Call me.

Richard.

1143
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:54,281
I'm telling you, I'm really
worried about Richard.

1144
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:56,450
I've been calling his house
for the past three days

1145
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,118
and I keep getting
the same message:

1146
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,788
"Hi. I'm not here,
and I may never be again."

Hey, Nat, are you okay?

1150
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:11,131
I'm afraid Griff's
gonna join Pacca-'s gang.

1151
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,259
Oh, come on.

1152
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:14,844
Yo, hey, yo, check this out.

00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:17,221

Paco and his little punk dogs

1154

we took.

1155
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,307
(both)
Huh?

1156
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,434
What I'm saying is,
they switched the tests.

1157
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:24,353
That's why everybody flunked.

1158
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,063
Well, you know, you guys.

1159
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:27,690
I probably didn't need
no help.

1160

Oh, my God,
this is awful.

1161
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,610
Then we just
got to find Mr. Clark.

Yeah, but where?

1163

a man that depressed?

Dim sum.

Okay, this is it.

Uh-huh.

1168
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:51,630
Why don't you two head
down that way? Okay.

1169
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:53,841
Anferny, go down
to the south end of the block,

1170
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,217
and I'll go down
this way.

You okay?
Mister, you okay?

1186
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,077
This girl over there,
she asked about you.

I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1191
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,544
I didn't know you drank.

1192
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,045
I drank?

1193
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:16,215

my pet gorilla here.

(Anferny) Come on, Mr.
Clark, snap out of it.

01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:26,016
We got to get Griff
out of that drug deal.

1199
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:29,103
Maybe we should just
let the cops handle this.

1200
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,271
That would be fine

1201
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:33,399
if I didn't mind waiting
20 years to see Griff again.

1202
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,943
All right. Now, don't worry.
I'll just go in and get him.

1203
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,362
Mr. Clark, you can't
just go in there and be like:

1204
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,447
"Okay, Griff,
we're going home,"

1205
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:43,617
else you gonna be
going home in a box.

1206
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,786
The only way we're going
to get Griff out of there

1207
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,289
is you got to show up in the
back room with the cash.

1208
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,416
You got the cash,
you the man.

1209
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:52,168
Where am I gonna
get the cash?

1210
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:53,919
Man, DeMarco gonna be there.

1211
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:55,880

he carry in his briefcase?

Food stamps?

1213

Your job is to make
his cash your cash.

1214
01:02:09,185 --> 01:02:10,269
Did you get it?

1215
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,687
It's all in there.
