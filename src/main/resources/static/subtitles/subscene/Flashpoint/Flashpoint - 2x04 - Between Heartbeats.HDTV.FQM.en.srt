1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,600
Ed Lane.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,700
It's Ed Lane I want.

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, okay.
Let me start working on that.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Working on that?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, yeah, he's out of range.
I got to track him down.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,100
He's standing next to you.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,600
???

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
-Eight-- is that enough?
-Yep.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,700
You still have Santorini
blue on your hand.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,600
Got to use
the thinner.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,500
Yeah, maybe if you left me some.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,400
I'll bring you
some more tonight.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,200
Flowers, bottle
of thinner.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,900
-Instant romance.
-Hey, by the way,

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,500
it's not Santorini blue;
it's Sanrini sky.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,000
Guys done with
the restock?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,400
Yeah.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
We're meeting
in the briefing room.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
Okay.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,400
Jules, how, uh...

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
how are the renovations coming?

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,900
Oh. 

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,000
Really good: one room left.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,800
A renovation ahead of schedule.
Wow, you getting any help?

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,100
-No.
-Come on.

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,000
Your own two hands...
that's amazing.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,700
-That's got to feel good.
-Yeah, it doe

28
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
Hi, it's Luka.
Leave a message.

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,500
???

30
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,800
??

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,900
???

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,300
??

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,900
???

34
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,400
I'll leave a key for you.
Take anything you want.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,200
I just have one favor to ask.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,500
Look at you.

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,200
Got three hours
till vacation.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,700
Someone's already
the dock

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,700
with his fishing rod
and his nice, cold beer.

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,800
What?

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm right here for you, buddy.
You know why?

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,700
No "I" in "team."

43
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
That's good. You can take
the next crank call,

44
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,100
kick some swatter ass
before you go.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Go for Ed.

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,700
Go for your beleaguered wife.

47
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
Hey, I thought you said
you were gonna pack your own clothes.

48
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,100
They were wet.

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,200
You know that big thing
beside the, uh...

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,100
washing machine?

51
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,500
-It's called a...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,100
Are you gonna pick me up
at noon or what?

53
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,800
Yeah, as soon
as Clark's done music camp.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Hey, where are the fishing rods?

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,600
So, they're in the car.
I packed them myself.

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,800
Ah, he packs the fun stuff.
You gonna be done shift on time?

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Yeah, as long ase don't
get swatted again.

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,700
What's that?

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,500
We're getting a bunch of 911s
from fake caller IDs.

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,400
I just busted in on an old lady
having a cup of tea.

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,500
Well, how about this?

62
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,300
You're late, and I'll swat you.

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,400
Nice.

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Long as you promise to wear
that old lady dress that I like so much.

65
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Goodbye.

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
Okay, I know
it's been a long day.

67
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,400
It's been a long
ten-day shift.

68
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,300
A few more hours.

69
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,700
Let's just keep it
together, okay?

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,300
Now, three swatter calls
in a day.

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,900
-A little hinky.
-Hinky?

72
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,700
Boss, it's starting
to feel personal.

73
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,900
I hear you.

74
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,400
Kira's trying
to do some digging around,

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,700
see if she can find a
connection, but in theeantime,

76
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
what do we do
if we get another call?

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,100
Any suggestions?

78
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,900
If a real call comes in,
we split up.

79
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,700
We don't want to be jammed up
in the wrong end

80
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,200
of the city
chasing our tails, right?

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,600
That's good: splinter unit.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
Splinter unit
for anything unconfirmed.

83
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,300
Wordy, you're in charge of that.

84
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,500
The two of you ride along
if it smells like another prank;

85
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,600
the rest of us...
let's stay here on standby.

86
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,100
Hit the gym, do target practice.

87
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,500
Do something. Let's get it out.

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,600
All right.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,300
I have no choice.

90
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,400
This is what war is.

91
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Your father gave me no choice.

92
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,800
That... that's my bus.

93
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
I'm sorry for you.

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm sorry for everything.

95
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,800
It's terrible to be at war.

96
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't blame me.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,700
Blame your father.

98
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,900
So, what
do you guys say?

99
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,200
Parking lot hoop
Game of 21?

100
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
When's the last time
you ever got 21?

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,300
Afraid of losing
to a family man, huh?

102
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,200
Hey, Clark,
how you doing, buddy?

103
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,400
Look...

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,800
Look, slow down, slow down.

105
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Just... no, just start
from the beginning.

106
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,600
Clark?

107
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Boss, I just got
off the phone with Clark.

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,400
-What happened?
-Some guy came up to him on the street,

109
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,400
started talking crap about me,
about how this is war.

110
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't blame him; blame me.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,500
Hey, sit down.
Sit down.

112
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,400
-Is Clark okay?
-He's okay.

113
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm sure
it's nothing.

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,300
But why don't you go anyway.

115
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
You sure? I was gonna ask...

116
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,700
Yeah, we're covered.
It's slow.

117
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,600
You're going
on vacation.

118
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,900
You are going
on vacation, right?

119
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm going on vacation, yeah.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,200
So, go see
your son.

121
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,300
Get out of town
before the traffic hits.

122
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,700
All right, be safe.
I'll see you.

123
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,000
Alright,
have fun.

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,700
Think he knows?

125
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Who?

126
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,900
Sarge.

127
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,800
Yes, I think
he knows.

128
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,300
Ow... why?

129
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,400
You have blue paint
on your ear.

130
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,400
Well, we might as well
just tell him now.

131
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,100
Get it over with.

132
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,600
I'll do it. I don't care.

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,400
Yeah, and then what?

134
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,300
One of us gets transferred
to another team?

135
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,500
These guys are my family.

136
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,300
Not just yours.

137
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Doesn't mean I want
to give you up.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Jules...

139
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
What?

140
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,100
Team 1, hot call
at Nathan Phillips Square.

141
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,300
Repeat: hot call.

142
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,200
That's City Hall, boss.

143
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
I hear it... Kira?

144
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,800
Reports of shots fired.

145
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,300
Multiple witnesses.

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,400
-Not a prank?
-No, sir.

147
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,800
I've got Inspector Stainton
on the line.

148
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,300
Let's see what's going on.

149
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,400
Inspector?

150
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,300
Sergeant, we got
one serious situation here.

151
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,000
Tell me.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,500
One injured: City Hall security guard's
been shot in the leg,

153
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,000
and we're pinned in here
real bad.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How many shots fired?

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thre four... they're coming
every two minutes.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
Honest to God, we don't know
where they're coming from.

157
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,200
You clear all the civilians,
four-block radius?

158
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,100
We're doing the best we can.
It's summertime in the city.

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,300
Greg.

160
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, we'll be right there.
Containment is the priority.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,900
I'll call you back in three.

162
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Kira, call Team 4.
All hands on deck. Eddie?

163
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,700
Trucks are loaded.

164
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,900
Okay, boys,
let's keep the peace.

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,900

???

169
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,800
Let's get
some shields.

170
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,900
Heads down.

171
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,900
They're pinned behind the car.

172
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,500
How is the victim doing,
Inspector?

173
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
He's holding on.

174
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,800
Sam, Louis, Wordy.

175
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,700
Let's give him some cover.

176
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Get him inside
so the EMT can get to him.

177
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,600
It's been a nightmare;
we got no idea

178
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,100
where these shots
are coming from.

179
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,700
And how are we doing
on containment?

180
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,000
We've evacuated all civilians
into the underground lots,

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,400
but you got people coming in and out
of all these buildings.

182
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Shooter's active.

183
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,000
Like clockwork,
every two minutes.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,600
-Lou?
-I'm on it.

185
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,100
Acoustic locator's
gonna nail his position

186
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,900
as soon as he shoots again.

187
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,100
Beyond the security guard,
there's no other injuries.

188
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,700
Thank God
this guy's not a pro.

189
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,800
Wordy, you get a look
at the wound.

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,300
Yeah. The exit wound's lower
than the entry.

191
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,900
Means he's shooting
from up top.

192
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,800
Okay, it's a target-rich environment
that's almost uncontainable.

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,200
I got no one to talk down.

194
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,500
Any word from counterterrorism?

195
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,600
No, I'm telling you,
no chatter, no warning, no nothing.

196
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
This guy's come
from of where.

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,600
Okay, Spike,
you stay in the Command Truck.

198
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,100
You run all the maps
and the intelligence,

199
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
all information flows
through you.

200
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,300
Copy.

201
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,300
Okay, I'm looking
at 300-meter radius on the 3-D.

202
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Buildings are dense.

203
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,100
Lots of places he can be,
lots of angles.

204
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,400
We got to try to narrow it down.

205
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Find out where the shots
are coming from.

206
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,200
Locaters are online,
so we got ears.

207
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,700
Let's see
if we can get any clues.

208
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,600
Louis, Wordy.

209
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,700
We'll do witnesses.

210
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,600
All right,
you press them for details.

211
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,500
I need to know where
that shot came from.

212
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,300
-Copy.
-The way the ??

213
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,700
did he spin,
did he crumple?

214
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,300
Any visible shimmers, muzzle flashes,
reflection, movement.

215
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,000
Sam, Jules, let's break it dow
Came from the south.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,200
We got a lot of options here.
Where would you go?

217
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Clock tower, classic,
lots of shadows, good concealment.

218
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Building under construction,
lots of visual distraction...

219
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,700
Whoa, whoa.

220
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
Buddy must be lucky

221
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,400
or he knows what
a sniper locator looks like.

222
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,300
He's located himself.

223
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,500
Ricochet directly through the target

224
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,100
to the point of origin.

225
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,000
-The hotel.
-Could be the roof.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,800
Any of those top floors.
A lot of tinted windows.

227
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,900
Let's start with the roof.

228
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,000
tive shooter,

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
we go to him.

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay. I'm gonna brief the Chief.
I'll be in the truck.

231
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,300
All right, use the overhang
for cover.

232
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,300
How many seconds
from his lt shot?

233
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,700
60 seconds.

234
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,300
Sam, grab a shield. Let's go. Go! Go!
I'm going to cover you.

235
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,900
If you don't think
you can make it,

236
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,400
wait till he fires again.

237
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
Copy that

238
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,700
Spike, count us down.

239
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,800
Ten, nine,

240
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
eight, seven, six,

241
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
five, four, three,

242
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,400
two, one.

243
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,000
Two minutes, right?

244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Copy. Over two minutes now.

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,300
All right, he's breaking
his pattern.

246
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,500
Maybe we're
getting warm.

247
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,700
Or he's moved.

248
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,000
Where would you go next,
it was you?

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,200
Clock tower's a no-biner.

250
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,600
Right there.

251
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,300
All those vents, visual distractions,
clean view of the square, boss.

252
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,900
Okay, see it.

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,700
-Inspector?
-Yeah?

254
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,900
Clock tower--

255
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
lock up the whole
southeast quadrant.

256
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,500
Copy that.

257
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,800
-No one in or out. SRU only.
-Done.

258
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
We got a chopper coming in
to sweep the rooftops.

259
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,800
You want a long-range, precision weapon
against a big noisy target?

260
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,700
-I'll call it off.
-Thanks.

261
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,500
-Sam, Jules?
-Almost there.

262
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,100
Somebody opened
those doors.

263
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,700
We're thinking he's moved,

264
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,400
but if he hasn't,

265
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,500
you're looking at booby traps,

266
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,500
ambush, suicide,
suicide by cop.

267
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,600
Maximum caution.

268
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,300
Our friend hit a seven-inch
target from 400 meters.

269
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,400
Roof's clear.
He's not up here.

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
But he was.

271
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,200
It's a .762. Carbon Striations.

272
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,400
He's got an HK G3.
That's nasty.

273
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,900
Shields are safe,
but that'll crack body armor.

274
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,800
This hotel has 43 floors.

275
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,100
Stainton's got uniforms sweeping
the interiors.

276
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,900
The rooftops are up to us.

277
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,700
Clock tower's next.

278
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,100
Copy that.

279
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Wordy, Louis, any luck
with the witnesses?

280
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,800
thing we don't
already know.

281
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,300
All right, move on.

282
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,400
Next highest building,
City Hall,

283
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
both rooftops.

284
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
Copy that.
On our way.

285
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,600
Spike, get forensics up
to the hotel roof.

286
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,700
Right now we're doing
everything we can.

287
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,600
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,300
Every step of the way.
Yeah. Bye.

289
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
Hey, way to start
your vacation.

290
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,900
Team 3,
I need access.

291
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
We kept the elevator
open for you.

292
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,900
What a scene, huh?

293
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
I don't get it.
I really don't.

294
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,100
What kind of a person would
do something like that?

295
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,700
-Thank you.
-Good Luck

296
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,100
Tactically?

297
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,700
-We can't do anything until...
-Until he starts shooting again.

298
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay, so help me out.
Who is this guy?

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Criminal sharpshooter.

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,700
I mean, usually, it's military
or law enforcement...

301
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,200
Yeah, but this guy doesn't seem
to be hitting his mark.

302
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,000
He's trying hard
not to, right?

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
A dozen shots, only one injury,
what are the odds, right?

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
Hit the locator pretty good.

305
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Okay, let's assume
he knows what he's doing.

306
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Typical profile?
Tyrannical sadist.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,700
Antisocial,
wants to play God,

308
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,100
wants control, wants to see
innocent people suffer.

309
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
-Except...
-Except there's only one injury,

310
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,700
not much
of a sadist.

311
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,600
Maybe it's targeted.
Maybe it's revenge.

312
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,500
Maybe it's...
maybe it's personal.

313
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,400
That's what Wordy said in
the briefing room, right?

314
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,700
"Feels like it's personal."

315
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,200
Three swatter calls, one shift.
That's a first.

316
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,000
This guy's trying to wear us out.
It's urban warfare strategy.

317
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,400
You hit the army when they're
tired returning from battle.

318
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,900
All right, I'm going
to check with Kira,

319
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,700
see if she tcked down
those swatter calls.

320
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,800
Sam, Jules.

321
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,500
Uniforms are sweeping the hotel.
We're heading to the clock tower.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,800
Kira forwarded the sound files
from 911 calls this morning.

323
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,100
They come from different
phone numbers?

324
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Yeah, but it sounds
like spoofing to me.

325
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,900
-Spoofing?
-Seems it's perfectly legal

326
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,600
to impersonate
another caller ID

327
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,000
if it's "for entertainment
purposes only."

328
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,900
Oh, my God, he's going
to shoot me!

329
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,100
They guarantee privacy.

330
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,300
They don't release
clients' names.

331
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,200
It's my friend. He says
he's going to shoot himself.

332
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,900
For a little extra they'll mess with
the pitch of your voice.

333
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,500
Help, please, put the gun down!

334
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,200
You hear that?

335
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,300
Three voices, one accent.

336
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,600
Eastern European?

337
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,400
Ed.

338
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,300
Personal.
First York.

339
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,000
No way.

340
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No choice. "It's not me,
it's your father. This is war."

341
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
How did Clark describe the guy
at the bus stop today?

342
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,700
Yeah, European accent. Young guy.

343
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,500
Noay.

344
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,200
-Call your family.
-All right.

345
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,100
Team, listen up,

346
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,400
We think we know
who this guy is.

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,200
???
thing staying at school.

348
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,300
Just sit tight, buddy.

349
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,500
Sit tight till Mom gets there.

350
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,400
Okay, I love you, too.

351
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Kira, get my wife and kid to the
station and lock down the SRU.

352
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,400
Okay, mid-20s, dark hair,
ordinary-looking. Spoke with an accent.

353
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,200
I know.

354
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,500
You shot his father.

355
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,200
He was close enough
to feel the bullet fly.

356
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,500
He took me to court
for wrongful death.

357
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,400
-And he lost.
-Yeah.

358
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,900
Okay.
Kira, Spike,

359
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
I need you to pull u
a wrongful death lawsuit.

360
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,100
Last name: Tomasic.

361
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,000
Copy that.

362
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm also sending out
a photograph of the subject.

363
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,300
News footage of First York.

364
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,700
Boss, I've got
his employment records.

365
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
Next of kin?

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,700
Goran Tomasic.

367
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,100
That's his father.
He's deceased.

368
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,900
y emergency contacts?

369
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
Luka Boblic.

370
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Here, I got a cell number.

371
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
Okay, let's get that guy here
immediately.

372
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Let's send a squad car.

373
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,200
Guys, what are
we doing here?

374
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,300
We've ID'd the subject.
We're looking for him.

375
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,900
He's camouflaged,
or he's hiding.

376
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,200
And what's the next step?

377
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,500
We get in his head;
we anticipate his next move.

378
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,900
Until en...

379
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,100
wait till he shoots again.

380
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,800
Terrific.

381
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,300
Uniforms have locked down
the entrances to the south buildings.

382
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,200
Wordy, Lou, how you guys doing
on the City Hall towers?

383
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
Rooftops are clear.

384
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,400
Going to the
mechanical room.

385
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,500
Where are you?

386
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,600
Just looking for my tennis
racketYou almost ready?

387
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
Listen, there's a squad car
going to come by.

388
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,300
It's going to pick you up.

389
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,100
A squad car?
Why?

390
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,900
Sophie, it's just
a precaution, okay?

391
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
I'll explain as soon as I can.

393
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,000
YeahYeah, okay.

394
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,100
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

395
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,900
We got to find this guy now.

396
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,800
Yeah, Spike found
a photo.

397
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,100
The guy's name is Petar Tomasic.

398
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
Quit his job two weeks ago,

399
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,100
and no one's answering the phone
at his apartment.

400
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,400
Guys, subject is confirmed.

401
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,000
Petar Tomasic. 26 year-old,
Caucasian, dark hair.

402
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Sam, Jules, where are you?

403
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,400
We're heading up
the clock tower.

404
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,300
Sweeping floor
by floor.

405
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,700
Nothing here, Ed.

406
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,600
Copy. Sam, Wordy, Louis,
what's your 20?

407
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,100
Clearing the mechanical room.

1
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,100
Clearing the mechanical room.

2
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,700
Heading to the East Tower.

3
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,500
All right, keep talking to us.

4
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,700
Eddie, Luka Boblic is here.
He was on scene.

5
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,900
You might want to listen in.

6
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,900
Luka, this is Ed Lane.

7
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
I know who you are.

8
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You know why you're here?

9
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
Petar left a message on my phone.

10
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
I heard on the radio what was happening.

11
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
I came down as fast as I could.

12
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,800
No one would let me through.

13
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,200
Petar left a message?

14
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,600
He said, uh, good-bye.

15
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,700
I knew something was coming.

16
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,300
Where is he?

17
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,000
That's just it; we don't know.

18
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,000
So, let's start with the basics, okay?

19
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,300
Does Petar have access to a gun?

20
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,500
I-I don't know.

21
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,600
Last week he told me he was thinking
about getting a rifle from some guy,

22
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,400
black market. I don't know who.

23
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,300
When I heard that, I said,

24
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
"Petar, you do this, I swear,
I'll turn you in myself."

25
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,600
He told me to forget it.
He was just kidding.

26
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,500
I believed him. I believed him.

27
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,100
This isn't your fault, Luka.

28
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Okay, he made his own choice here today.

29
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,000
But you can still help him.

30
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,300
He was...

31
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,300
so angry at everything, everyone.

32
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
He think you ruined his life.

33
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,300
Did he say what kind of rifle it was?

34
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I don't know.

35
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,100
Does he know how to shoot it?

36
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,800
Does your friend know
how to shoot a rifle?

37
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,800
Snipers were how we protected ourselves.

38
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,100
Petar ot eight men dead before he was 16.

39
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,900
Croatia, it was a civil war, sir.

40
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,300
Petar Tomasic was one of the
best snipers in our country.

41
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,200
We were like brothers; we were little
kids together; we grew up together.

42
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,000
So, what happened?

43
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,100
Petar got recruited by the local militia.

44
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,500
He fought alongside his
father against the Serbs.

45
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,200
Everyone called him
"Mali Sniperist"--"Baby Sniper."

46
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,600
He protected our village.

47
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,200
Subject is a skilled sniper,
familiar with urban warfare.

48
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,900
If he was missing his mark,
he was missing it on purpose.

49
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Guys, this is a revenge situation.

50
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,500
Good news: We've narrowed it down.

51
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,200
He's looking for me.

52
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,900
I killed his father at First York Plaza.

53
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,100
Two years, I was at school, he was hiding
in the hills, fighting our enemies.

54
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,000
Until they found out who he was.

55
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
They didn't come after him.
They came after his family.

56
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
They tortured his mother
and they killed her and...

57
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,200
And he nearly went crazy.

58
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
But his father saved him.

59
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
They escaped through two countries on foot.

60
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,700
So, the woman that, um,
that was shot at First York?

61
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,700
His stepmother.

62
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,600
Boss?

63
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,600
Yeah, Kira.

64
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,600
You were right.

65
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,300
Spoofing network confirmed all three 911s

66
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,400
were routed through them
from the same client.

67
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,000
But they don't want to release
the client's name without a subpoena.

68
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,100
Want me to play bad cop on them?

69
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,300
No, thanks, Ki.

70
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,900
I think we may have
what we need right here.

71
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,200
Copy that.

72
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,300
Luka, if we can talk to him,

73
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,900
we may be able to stop him
from harming anybody else.

74
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,800
I know his cell number.

75
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,700
Thank you.

76
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,600
Petar Tomasic?

77
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,100
Petar, it's Greg Parker with the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

78
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,700
Thank you very much for picking up.

79
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,700
Petar?

80
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,900
Petar, I think it's important
that we start talking.

81
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,200
Why?

82
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,400
Maybe I can help you if I can
understand what you're looking for.

83
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,900
- I know what I'm looking for.
- Oh, yeah?

84
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,500
Ed Lane. It's Ed Lane I want.

85
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,400
Okay, okay, let me start working on that.

86
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,200
Working on that?

87
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,800
Well, yeah, he's out of range.
I got to track him down.

88
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,300
He's standing next to you.

89
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,800
I guess you can see everything, huh, Petar?

90
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,300
Like you. You can hear everything.

91
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,800
You can see everything.

92
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Almost.

93
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,200
???

94
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,200
We, we waited till he shot
again, didn't we, Sergeant?

95
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,100
That kid was 24 years of age.
Fresh out of police academy.

96
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,600
You tell me how we could've
prevented that! You tell me!

97
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,100
You want to call the Chief on this?
You call him, you explain it!

98
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,400
No, no, I want to settle this thing.

99
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,500
Confirm Team 4 is containing
east buildings.

100
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,500
Can't tell where the sound came from.
Could be any building in this range.

101
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,100
He's using these curved walls.

102
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,700
Refracting the sound,
he's covering his tracks.

103
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
He's in the vicinity.

104
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
He's accelerating to get a respoe
and he's targeting law enforcement.

105
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,900
He can see me and he's
trying to draw me out.

106
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,100
Boss, if you get him back
on the phone, keep him on it;

107
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,500
I can try acking his position.

108
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
Copy that.

109
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,400
- Knew my dad was a cop, right
- thought he was a farmer.

110
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,400
Yeah, well, before that he was a cop.

111
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Remember the Tower Sniper?

112
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,700
Yeah, 40 years ago,
guy in a clock tower?

113
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,200
- He killed 16 people that day.
- Cops couldn't get to him.

114
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,000
They didn't have the tools or the training.

115
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,200
When it was all over with, they decided
they were gonna do something about it.

116
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,700
You're kidding. Your dad was
part of the first SWAT teams?

117
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,500
No, he was one of the cops
that couldn't do anything.

118
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,400
He bought a farm in the prairies and
raised me and my brothers away from it all.

119
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,400
So, I guess he wasn't exactly
thrilled that you became a cop.

120
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
We got to get this guy.

121
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,600
You know what? He's not answering.

122
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,800
- Luka, you mind calling him on your own phone?
- No.

123
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,500
Boss, boss, the subject's already volatile.

124
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,800
You sure we want to bring
in a third party now?

125
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,700
Yeah, we're out of time.

126
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,700
And you think the kid can talk to him?

127
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,000
No, but he can keep him on the line long
enough for Spike to get a lock on where he is.

128
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
- Okay.
- Luka...

129
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,700
Luka, if you get him talking,
think past his plan to the bigger picture.

130
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,000
- You said you were like brothers, right?
- Right.

131
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,700
Team, we're bringing in a TPI.

132
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,300
Put it on speaker. Spike, I'm coming in.

133
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,700
Petar.

134
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,500
English.

135
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,900
What good is this going to do?

136
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,500
you know what they did.
You know what I have to do.

137
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
He promised me it'd be
different here, but it's not.

138
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,400
Come on. Come on.

139
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,900
I got used to not being afraid.

140
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,800
You don't need to be afraid.

141
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,400
They told me no one will be hurt.

142
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,100
That's what they said
before he shot my father.

143
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,800
Tell them I want Ed Lane to come out.

144
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Or more people will die!

145
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,600
Petar!

146
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,700
Phone's dead.

147
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,100
Doesn't matter. I got it.

148
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
- Where?
- Right there.

149
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,500
He's on the roof.

150
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,300
That was locked down.
How'd he get in?

151
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,500
Jules, Wordy, meet me at the
southeast corner, Bay and Queen.

152
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,200
Copy.

153
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,800
On our way.

154
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,000
Let's stop this guy before
he shoots somebody else.

155
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,900
Eddie, you're the target.
You're not going anywhere.

156
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,000
You're staying covered
right here, okay.

157
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,700
You can act as spotter
from the ground.

158
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,100
- Boss...
- That's an order.

159
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,300
Team, report in.

160
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,900
Leaving City Hall.

161
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,100
There's an employee entrance.

162
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,700
Let's do this fast
before he shoots again.

163
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
We kept the freight elevator
open for you guys.

164
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,400
Stairwell's been blocked off.
No one's been up or down?

165
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,700
Not since we locked it up.
One SRU officer, that's it.

166
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,300
One SRU officer?

167
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
- Alone?
- Yeah.From Team 3.

168
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,500
Thanks.

169
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
Hey, Ed, Team 3 on the scene?

170
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,600
Negative. Team 4. Why?

171
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,200
Copper said an SRU went up to the roof. Solo.

172
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,900
He said he was Team 3.

173
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,000
Jules...

174
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,500
Yeah, I know.

175
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,300
Spike, put out an APB.

176
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,600
Subject may be wearing an SRU uniform
or a mockup identifying himself as Team 3.

177
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,400
We got reports that SRU entered building
southwest corner, Bay and Queen.

178
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,000
We're accounted for.
Team 4's accounted for.

179
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,800
Is there anything else
you can tell us, Luka?

180
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,000
Anything at all?

181
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,800
He's not a bad person. He's not.

182
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,000
He got a job. tried to fit in,

183
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,600
but when his father was killed
right in front of him...

184
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,900
I wanted to help him. The lawsuit--

185
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,500
it was useless, expensive.
It just made it worse.

186
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,800
He got more angry, more bitter.

187
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,400
It was... It was terrible to watch.

188
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,300
Ed, we're at the roof.
We're ready to move in.

189
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,800
Northwest corner by the air vent.
Looks like a rifle barrel.

190
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,600
Copy.

191
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
Guys, they're going in.

192
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,400
Boss?

193
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,900
Yeah, I'm on my way.

194
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,000
- Lou, Wordy?
- Almost tre.

195
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,700
Thanks.

196
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,100
He's not moving.

197
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,700
- Low and slow.
- Copy.

198
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,600
He shot himself. Any signs of trauma?

199
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,600
- It's hard to tell.
- I think we got him.

200
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,900
Police, drop your weapon!

201
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,000
Hands in the air  or we will shoot!

202
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,200
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!

203
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Show me your hands!

204
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,300
It's a decoy!

205
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,600
Where is he?

206
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,900
It's a decoy. Fall back.
Fall back now! Take cover!

207
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,100
Officer down! Officer down!

208
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,300
Medic, come now. Jules has been hit!

209
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,500
Officer down. We need EMS.

210
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,900
Bay and Queen. SRU officer down.

211
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,800
Stay with me, Jules.

212
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,400
Stay with me.

213
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,700
Stay with me.Stay with me.

214
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,500
We're under fire! Get up here now!

215
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Somebody get an angle on this guy!

216
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,700
Shots are coming from City Hall.

217
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,700
Boss, this is about me.

218
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,000
I come out, draw his fire,
you get her out of the way.

219
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Negative. Negative.
We do it as a team.

220
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,600
Copy, Greg. Get her out of there.

221
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Spike, you and me,
West Tower, City Hall.

222
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Low and tight.

223
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,700
- Louis, you cover.
- Yup.

224
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,500
Roof's a grate.

225
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,900
We'll get eyes on the mechanical room.

226
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,000
Keep her sealed off.

227
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,500
Stay tight. Stay tight.

228
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
You're gonna be okay.

229
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,000
- We're getting you out.
- Keep her stiff.

230
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
We're getting you out, Jules.

231
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,500
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

232
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,600
Easy! Easy!

233
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Hang on.We got you.

234
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,400
Come on. Come on.

235
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,800
She's clear!

236
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,300
We've got him. Upper left.

237
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,400
Go.

238
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,800
Hey, got to let her go.

239
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,600
Team 4 Sierra's countering
from the East Tower.

240
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,100
Sam, let's find a Sierra shot.

241
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,700
I got it.

242
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,500
???

243
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,300
Boss, I found a vantage point.

244
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,900
I can see thmechanical roof.

245
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,700
Petar.

246
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,500
??? r the first five minutes of every day,

247
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,300
I forget that he's gone.

248
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
Then I remember, and I see him die.

249
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,400
Okay.

250
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,700
He's got Ed.

251
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,000
He's got a gun to his head.

252
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,500
We're on ouray, Spike.

253
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,500
I don't have a clear shot.

254
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,900
Ed's in my line of fire.

255
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,100
Come on. Come on! Come on!

256
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,200
You know what it's like to do what you
got to do to save your family, okay?

257
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm just... I just...

258
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,000
My family's dead.

259
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,100
- Okay, take a breath.
- You killed my father.

260
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,400
- Petar. Petar.
- ???

261
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,700
Let's just slow it down
here, buddy, okay?

262
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,700
I need you to...

263
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,600
Tomorrow morning, for
the first five minutes...

264
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,000
...your son will forget that you're gone.

265
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,300
I need you to listen to me now,
buddy, all right?

266
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Sam, we need a solution.

267
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,600
I can't get a clear shot.
He's behind the pillar.

268
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,600
Ed, you got to move forward.

269
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,900
I need you to listen to me.

270
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm sorry, but I need you
to listen to me.

271
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,700
Please don't shoot.

272
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,700
Subject's down.

273
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,400
Not a good day for either of us.

274
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,300
Yes, sir.

275
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,200
Just give him a minute, will you?

276
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,200
- Where is she?
- Saint Simon's. We're on our way.

277
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
- I want to go with you.
- Sam.

278
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,300
??? Get there when you can, okay?

279
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,300
We'll be there.
We're not going anywhere.

280
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,500
It's a good job.

281
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Braddock?

282
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,400
What? Please? Please?
He was my friend.

283
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,600
- He's cleared.
- He wasy friend.

284
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,900
Next of kin.

285
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,600
What should I have said to him?

286
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,800
What should I have said?

287
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,600
What? Hey.

288
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,700
You did the best you could do.

289
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,300
Know that.You hear me?

290
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,100
You know that.
That's all you can do.

291
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,100
Go on.

292
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,400
Hey, Jules.

293
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,900
Hey, sweetheart, how you doing?

294
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,700
I got here as fast as I could, Jules.

295
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,700
I'm so sorry.

296
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
I should have protected you.

297
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,400
Jules.

298
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,400
Okay, time to go, buddy.

299
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,700
No way.

300
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,900
There's nothing for you to do here.

301
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,000
If there was, I wouldn't
let you leave. Go on.

302
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,200
She's on my team...

303
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,400
Eddie, you're two hours away,
anything happens, anything changes.

304
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,700
You need to be with your family.

305
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,300
Do you hear me?

306
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,100
Those aren't just words.

307
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
Go on.

308
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,300
???

309
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Hey, kiddo.

310
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,300
How's she doing?

311
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,800
She's stabilized.

312
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,400
She's in good hands. She'll be okay.

313
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,600
And how are you doing?

314
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,600
I'm exhausted.

315
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,400
Yeah. Want to talk about it?

316
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,700
- en we get there, okay?
- Okay. I'll drive.

317
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
Hey, kiddo.

318
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,400
Hey.

319
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,300
Can I sit in the front, Dad?

320
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
All right.

321
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Jump in. Jump in.
