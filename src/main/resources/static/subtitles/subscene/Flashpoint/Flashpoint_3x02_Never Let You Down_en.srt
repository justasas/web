70
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,940
You okay with that, eddie?

71

I know why i'm here.

81
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,390
You're down a guy and i'm replacing him.

82
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,070
Don't hate me for it.

83
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,410
Firefighting unit i served with, we lost one of ours, so...

84
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,120
I know what that's like.

85
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,540
If you wanna talk about it?

86
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,170

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,970
Time and a place.

90
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,320
Winnie: we have gunshot reports at 8112 wolf trail crescent.

91
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,380
Parker: how long since the shot was fired?

92
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,010
Officer: 15 minutes.I'm pretty sure we have a hostage situation in there.

93
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,940
Parker: 'kay, any of your officers try to make contact?

94
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,430
Police officer: no, i told my guys to maintain a hard perimeter and wait for the cavalry.

95
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,580
Thank you.

96
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,580

Sam: no, but she does have a boyfriend.

100
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,390
It's not the first time the neighbour's heard them arguing.

101
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,440
Yeah, but this time it got physical.

102
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,250
All right, guys, i sketched a floor plan based on the neighbour's description.

00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,810

Okay, new deal.Jules, call it.

All right, let's read the scene fast.Time's against us.

131
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,720
Spike, need you in the truck for intel.Jules, the witness.

132
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,840
Priority is the boyfriend's name, a vehicle, a destination, anything.

133
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,140
- Leah: greg?
- Yeah, leah?

134
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,290

" Jules: so, you do know his name?

139
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,450
No.I don't even know her that well.

140
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,730
After the gunshot, did you see anything?Did you hear a car take off?

141
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,290
Oh, totally.

142
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:34,410
A few minutes after the shot, i looked out my window and i saw this car come tearing out of the parking lot.

143
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,470
Great.Did you manage to get a plate number?

144
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,020
No, it moved too fast.

145
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,220
Can you describe the vehicle?

146
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,290
I don't know, four doors, uh, kinda old?

147
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,010
You have to be a little bit more descriptive then that.

148
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,230
Rachel: you know, my grandfather, he used to drive the exact same car.

149
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,570
Kinda smelled inside 'cause my brother...

150
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,880
Do you remember the colour?

151
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,620
- Reddish?
- Reddish.

152
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,150
Okay, so you don't know a make?

153
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,250
'Kay, i don't know cars.

154
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,170
Well, i have a friend who does, so...

155
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,570
You're gonna come with us right now.

156
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,030
He's gonna stay though, okay?

157
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,200
Stay, archie.

158
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,010
Ed: okay, boss, no signs of forced entry here except our handiwork.

159
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,140
Parker: so either she was okay with inviting him in...

160
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,470
Or she was okay with not being shot when he was waving a gun in her face.

161
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,560
What do you got, sam?

162
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,240
Small caliber casing, .380 acp.

163
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,650
This matches the box of ammo wordy found i *****

164
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,550
So the gun was hers.

165
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,250
Rachel: nope.

166
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,480
N wait...

167
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,210
No.

168
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:41,060
Rachel, assuming the subject's vehicle is speeding away as we speak, time is kinda important here.

169
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,530
Rachel: okaywell...i guess it sorta had, like, these long, strehed out cat eyes.

170
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,510
Spike: cat eyes?

171
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,310
Rachel: sorry.

172
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,540
No, no, cat eyes, cat eyes...i can work with cat eyes.

173
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,860
She's in cheschool.

174
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,520
There's nothing here.Nothing to go on.No photos.

175
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,240
Actually, there is.No photos means no family, isolated, maybe estranged.

176
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,810
Right.Th's why she's with the badass boyfriend.

177
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,360
Perceptive.

178
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,870

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,000

Ed: boss, i'm thinking she kept a handgun just in ca.Let him in, hing not to use it.

Parker: yeah, things go sout she goes for the gun...n her bag...

184
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,850
Maybe there's struggle, goes off...

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,730
Ed: and misses.

186
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,670
There's no blood, so that's a positive.

187
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,650
- Spike: boss, i got something.
- Go ahead.

188
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,830
Spike: subject's vehicle is a red nebraska, mid '90s.

Parker: let's put an apb out on the car.One male, one female passenger.

190
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,590
This is an armed abduction.

191
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,910
If they'repotted, do not engage.Sru only.

192
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,580
Copy.I'm gonna patch you into the red lit traffic cams too.

193
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,040
Alison: oh my god, is she l right?

194
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,280
Jules: we don't know yet.We think that she's beenbducted.

195
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,240
It's gotta be jeff.

196
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,330
Is that her boyfriend?

197
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,950

198
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,660

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,130
- So he's her boyfriend?
- Waitress: ex.

203
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,830
Only he doesn't think so.

204
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,120
You know, she keeps trying to break up with him, he keeps try to make up with her,

205
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,520
But this morning it didn't work.

206
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,470
Has h been violent with her?Made any reats?

207
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,190
Yeah, i mean, he's rough with her, he's always putting her down.

208
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,690
Why would she ay with him?

209
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,530
Alison: "i need you, bab" uh, "all we have is each other.

210
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,200
" And she fell fort every time.

211
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,700
It's ke she couldn't think straight.

212
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,860
Jeffrey is what we call "known to the police.

213
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,160
" Break and enter, aggravated assault.

214
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,390
Does he have a registered nraska by any chance?

215
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,410
No, but carjacking seems well within his skill set.

216
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,030
Jules: has she report him for assault ?

217
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,140
Aliso no, she's crazy loyal.

218
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:47,110

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,570
I got a home address.

221
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,990
Okay, team, we're on the move.

222
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,250
Jeff we could, but...i mean, that wouldn't be very smart.

223
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,400
'Cause i don't know where else you're gonna get a deal.

224
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,960

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,790
His name's dale.

248
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,200
He's obsessed with zoe.He's got a re thing for her.

249
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,470

- **** you talk to zoe.

250
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,380
Way look, man, i've seen the way you look at her.She's half your age.

251
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,810
You wanna dance, old man?

252
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,770
Don't you dare touch her again.

253
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,580
E deserves better than you.

254
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,570
I'm telling you, there's something off in the head with that guy.

255
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,290
Ed: boss, the insurance numbers match, items stolen from a pawn shop earlier this morning.

256
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,360
Jeff: must be a mistake.

257
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,110
Are you interrupting my friend?

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,140
Go ahead.

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,770
The alarm was tripped at:05, he's in the clear.

260
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,080
He didn't take zoe.

261
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,030
The good news here, jeff, is that we still get to arrest you for robbery.

262
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,190
What?You can't prove i did it.

263
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,320
Ed: you were caught on the video surveillance camera.Officer wordsworth?

264

Ed: nope.Keep walking, jeff.

- Suspects?
- Spike: nothing solid.

337

- Spike: dale murray.

343
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,540
No.

344
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,790
Jules: she was abducted violently.There was aunshot.

345
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,600
Parker: ma'am, you know anything...

346
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,860
There's a trailer, just west othe city.

347
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,900
That's where he lives now.

348
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,160
Guys, we got a location.

349
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,070

00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,340
The policehought imight be dale; he was the last one to see wendy.

351
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,650
He drove her to the bus station, so she could go back to college,

352
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,210
But she never got there.

353
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,620
Hold on, one second.

354
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,390

357
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,090
Dale said they had an argument.

358
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,280
The police were all over us, investigating dale.

359
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,130
They never told me what was going on.

360
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,550
And i was going crazy and dale just hid in that damn trailer.

361
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,210
No phone, just hiding.

362
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,810
That girl...

363
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,610
She looks like wendy.

364
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,010
Sorry about the rgh ride.

365
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,840
We couldn't take the chance *****.

366
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,390
I put the blaets in the trunk,in the back,to make sure that you were more comfortable.

367
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,620
I hope that was okay?

368
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,750
Was it okay?

369
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,530
Yeah,it was okay.

370
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,170
Good.

371
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,710
You like it?

372
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,150
Yeah,i thought you might wanna put on some new clothes.

373
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,390
Something fresh.

374
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,980
Thank you.

375
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,330
Wendy loves butterflies.

376
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,780
Wendy?

377
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,870
You know,it's time somee cooked for you for a change.

378
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,860
I've got roast chicken,garlic mashed potatoes.

379
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,040
Your favourite,right?

380
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,380
I never would've thought to add the caramelized onions until i saw you do it.

381
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,440
You saw me do it?

382
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,190
Wh you started seeing jeff,i had to keep aeye on you.

383
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,160
I kept my distance,of course i didn't want to interfere.

384
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,980
It's not easy...

385
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,110
Watching you like that.

386
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,020
I am not gonna take my eyes off you again,not for a second.

387
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,100
Anyway...

388
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,530
We're together again,so let's not worry about the past.

389
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,290
Would you like a glass of wine?

390
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,270
No thanks.

391
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,880
Maybe with lunch,yes?

392
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,400
Right.

393
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,530
Okay,good.

394
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,800
Who's wendy?

395
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,370
It's my daughter.

396
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,340
How old is she?

397
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,610
She's 21.

398
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,810
So what does she do?Does she...

399
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,620
I'd rather not ta about it,okay?

400
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
Ugh,i'm sorry.

401
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,820
It's the onions.

402
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,490
No!

403
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,560
Get ready,guys.

404
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,680
Boss said after two miles of dirt road,trailer should be right there.

405
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,410
Any other population up here?

406
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,890
Campgrounds?Cabins?

407
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,050
Not according to the satellite images.Just trs,trees,and more trees.

408
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,450
Let's move it,let's go.

409
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,370
Stop!Stop!

410
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,590
No!Help!

411
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,760
Boss,they werjust here.

412
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,560
Door's open,food on the stove,car's missing...

413
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,850
Table set for two,zoe's still alive.

414
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,790
At least she was untithey left in a hurry.

415
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,070
Hidden in the back of dale's closet...

416
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,620
Pictures of zoe,her class schedule...

417
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,360
Boss,he's had her under the microscope for months.

418
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,770
She didn't even know it.

419
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,080
Sometimes it's the quiet ones you gotta worry about.

420
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,460
All right.Just keep looking.Fast is good.

421
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,620
Copy that.

422
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,500
Guys,transponders on.Fan out,full stealth.

423
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,320
Wordy,contact regional pd,

424
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,260
Get 'em to keep watch for a red nebraka in case our friend's hit the highway.

425
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,250
Leah,you're with me.

426
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,000
You got it.

427
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,550
I'll get the parabolic mic,see what we can pick up.

428
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,880
Well,good news.

429
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,010
Dale and zoe were at the trailer,like you said.

430
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,530
Just ********.

431
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,230
Murray,o you think that...

432
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,940
Your ex-Husband was responsible for your dauter's disappearance?

433
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,860
He started acting odd.

434
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,600
Go on,please.

435
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,890
When i'd try to talk to him,he was...

436
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,950
Nothere.

437
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,030
He stopped bathing,eating...

438
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,450
Lived in his on world,locked away in his tiler,cut off from everyone.

439
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,510
Sounds likee had a breakdown.Did he get any help?

440
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,300
He wouldn't stop staring at her photo,saying he loved her too much.

441
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,980
Aying sorryher.

442
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,470
He started talking about how he wanted to die...

443
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,000
I made him go into the greenfalls institute.

444
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,750
Greenfalls institute.Hold on one moment.

445
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,650
- Team on e team leader,you copy?  - Copy.

446
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,180
'Kay,be advised that the subject has spent time in a mental facili,

447
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,590
Dealing with a possible edp.

448
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,400
You shouldn't have done that.

449
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,100
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,920
Sweetie,you can't r away.

451
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,630
It's not safe for you out here.

452
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,810
I just wanto go home.

453
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,600

I know we ll.

459

No.

460
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,640
No?

461
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,020
I don't understand.Ou used to love it here,don't ou remember?

462
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,400
Honey,you used to beg me to stay,you nevr wanted to go home.

463
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,210
Dale,what do you mean?

464
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,540
Dale?

465
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,430
Vehicle approachin.

466
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,030
Talk to me,spike.

467
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,480
South southwestrom you.

468
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,630
Is it our red neaskan?

469
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,580
Can't hear the make andolour,it's definitely an old car.

470
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,510
I'll bet he's heading back to the trailer.

471
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,680
It's the police.

472
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,900
Ed!He's braked!He's reversing.

473
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,320
Okay,spike,we got him.All the roads lead to the same place.

474
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,420
Follow my transponder signal

475
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,930
How long at greenfalls?

476
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,260
Six months.

477
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,970
And how was he diagnosed?

478
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,330
Severe depression,acute um...

479
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,620
Something paranoid.

480
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,910
Acute lusional paranoia?

481
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,350
He kept imagining he'd finally f...Found wendy...

482
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,610
And that people were trying to take heaway again.

483
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:49,930
But when he was dischar his symptoms were under corol,right?

484
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,590
No.Greenfalls is voluntary.He discrged himself.

485
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,790
When he did,he wouldn't talk to me.

486
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,660
N't touch m he moved his trailer to the woods,spent all his time there.

487
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,190
I filed for divorce a year ago.

488
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,640
Sounds like he never got better.

489
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,130
How could he?

490
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,760
Living with the guilt of what he did.

491
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,990
What do you think he did?

492
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,970
You tell me.

493
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,240
You think he killed wendy.

494
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,220
I'm gonna go make a phone call.I'm gonna be right back.

495
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,350
There's thecar.

496
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,820
We got a visual.

497
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,140
You wanna aroach direct or cover from the truck?

498
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,810
What do you wanna do?

499
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,690
- Hit it hard.  - Copy that.

500
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,500
Vehicle's immobilized,we're moving in.

501
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,320
Aha team approaching on your left.

502
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,970
Bravo on your right.

503
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,090
- Police!  - Police!

504
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,000

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,400
Clear!

506
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,530
He thinks he has a better shot on foot.

507
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Probably knows tse woods inside out.

508
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,440
All right.

509
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,800
Ten mepart.

510
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,140
Do not engage until we're in control position.

511
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,650
Remember,he's still armed.

512
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,290
Wendy murray.

513
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,630
You're gonna have to rresh my memory,sergeant.

514
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,240
She was 18-Years-Old,dettiv she disappeed about three years ago.

515
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,440
She got on a bus,on her way to college never seen agai.

516
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,300
Remember the case.

517
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,720
We beat the bushes on that one.

518
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,990
We chased every lead,ery scrap...

519
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,760
And?

520
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,030
She bought a bus tick.

521
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,200
She intended to get to her destination.

522
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,710
Why she didn't?We don't know.

523
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,430
Ye,but the father,dale,y think he was involved?

524
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,720
We looked at him.

525
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,850
Had to he was our only lead.

526
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,970
But in the d,we found no evidence whatsoever.

527
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,070
The kid had a fight with her dad.She was 18.

528
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,360
Par for the course.

529
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,210
No connection.

530
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,900
Youdon't think she's still out there?

531
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,450
No phone call at christmas,no contact oany kind.

532
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,530
She hasn't got any money,social insurance untouched for three years...

533
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,370
Yeah,i hear i heara.

534
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,290
There's only so long we cakeep looking for a body.

535
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,910
Lookthe ex-Wife,she's convinced that the fther is responsible.

536
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,440
Now,you're saying that there's no reason to suspect this g?

537
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,830
No.I investigate a hundred v missing pers cases a yea.

538
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,940
A lot of them kids.

539
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,480
Where there's no body,there's no closure.

540
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,500
It wouldn'te the first time i've sn parents lose it,start pointing fingers at each other.

541
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,740
Yeah yeah,thanks,detective.

542
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,450
- Dale,stop!  - Quiet!

543
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,370

544
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,480

545
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,320
Where?

546
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,020
750 feet,northeast,straight ahead.

547
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,510
*****To be quiet.

548
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,710

549
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,410
Help!Help !

550
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,760
Wendy,plea!Please,they're gonna hear you.

551
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,070
******

552
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,950
Police!Stop right there!

553
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,790
Police!Don't move!

554
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,650
Dale murray,stay where you are!

555
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,050
There's nowhere to run,dale.

556
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,850
Drop your weapon!

557
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,770
You stay back!

558
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,160
Stay back!

559
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,280
Mrs...mrs...mrs.Murr.

560
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,810
Dale didn'do anything toendy.

561
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,040
He's doing what you'rdoing now.

562
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,760
Wha do you mean?

563
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,120
He's lking for someone to blame.

564
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,670
The only thing in this world worsthan losing a child,isot knowing what happened to her.

565
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,970
Youe blaming dale because that's an answer,and dals blaming himself because that's an answer t.

566
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,500
But its not theight answer.

567
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,780
Because neither one of you are to blame.

568
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,690
I'm sorry,but wendy is gone.

569
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:16,700
Judith,she's gone,and that is what you need to start dealing with.

570
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,250
Now,zoe a dale,they're gonna come home safely,

571
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,150
And when he does,he's gonna need help.

572
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,010
Youan help him,you can be there,if you're willing.

573
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,910
I've got theolution.

574
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,820
We take out dale,zoe'll go over the edge with him.

575
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,140
Copy that.

576
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,630
Team one,status?

577
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,730
Boss,we got h contained,but he's sti got zoe and he's still armed,

578
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,460
And they're looking down at a 150 foot drop.

579
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,480
Okay,team,listenp.

580
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,190
Dale doesn't wanna hurt zoe because he believes that zoe is his daughter.

581
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,740
Go on,sarge.

582
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,490
Lose your daughter,she's missing for the years,and you've got a choice

583
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,640
You can accept that she's dead,or you can believe hat she's still alive.

584
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,200
Aoe looks like his daughter,he gets under his skin.

585
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,310
He's trying to protect her.

586
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,760
And a father always wants to protect his children.

587
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,060
He is desional,no question.

588
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,260
I'm sure he's not very happy to see you right now,is he?

589
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,470
No.He isn't.

590
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,300
Okay,well,that's probly because of the cops planted that seed.

591
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,360
Father gets invesigated,and he stts to feel responsible,so just...

592
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,500
Just go careful,eddie.

593
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,960
We gotta stabilize him here.

594
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,610
We gotta decrease pressure.

595
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,850
'Kay,jes?

596
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,860
Go,sarge.

597
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Jules,want you to this negotiation.I'm gonna be your secdary.

598
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,120
Got it.

599
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,700
Spike,you got ears?

600
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,860
I'll get the mic in up close,report back.

601
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,460
All right,we got watch dale's back here.

602
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,720
Werappel down the cliff,contain him from behind.

603
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,910
It's too risky.He'll see ya.

604
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,400
Plenty of trees for cover.

605
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,030
Static rope willet us down.

606
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,180
We n traverse across to their exact location.

607
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,610
All right.Don't crest that cliff 'til you hear my go.

608
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,880
Copy.

609
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,750
Okay,i got the sweetspot i can hear 'em now.

610
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,240
It's okay,it's okay.

611
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,470
Ey,dale,my name's jules.

612
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
You stay back!

613
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,220
Absolutely.I'monna take a fteps ack here,and give you some space.

614
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,610
Now,rememb,it's all about keepingoe close to him.

615
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,390
He's just found his daughter,he's not gonna let go of her.

616
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,850
Dale,you're really close to the edge rig now.

617
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,650
If you wanna keep her safe,you might wanna take aew steps forward.

618
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,630
Set the anchors no more than ten feet apart.

619
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,870
Lea you got it.

620
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,000
Quick question,sarge.

621
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,500
If he thinks zoe's his daughter...

622
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,900
Don't contradict him,but don't reinforce his delusion eitr.

623
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,460
Findommon ground.

624
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,830
That's right.Your job isn't to cu him,jules.

625
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,090
Your jo's to guide him out of the crisis,that's it,nd you're doing great.

626
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,810
Y just keep doing what you're doing.

627
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:12,580
Hey,dale,can you tl me something about the woman you're with i can tell that she means a lot to you.

You know,i admire what you're trng to do right now.

I do.You're putting up a fight for what you think is right,

630
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,370
You're tting yourself on the line.

631
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,890
No reonse means that you've got his attention

632
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,640
I think we all want the same thing re.

633

Hold on,hold on,i got something.

He says you're playin mind games,jules.

636

I'm not gonna let go!

669

Is this what you call keeping someone safedale?

670
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,180
Listen to me.

671
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,740
I'm sorry that wendy disappeared from your life.

672
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,120
I cannot even imagin what you have been through.

673
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,630
But i do know wht it is like to lose somebody ho had absolutely no business dying...

674
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,670
And to have not had a chance to say gooye;

675
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,700
And to be disgusted with people for just walking do the street li the world's the same place;

676
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,920
That if you had just done something different.

677
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,750
They still might be there.

678
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,930
So you can keep on struggling,

679
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:27,650
Nd get both of yourselves killed,and that will be ur fault.

680
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,830
Or you can let go,and let yoursels live.

681
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,020
What would wendy want you to do

682
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,390
What would she want y to do,dale

683
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,900
