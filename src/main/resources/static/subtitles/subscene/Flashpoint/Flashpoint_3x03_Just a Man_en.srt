1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,830
you're gonna show me that you're
still the guy that i can trust.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,820
man,i told you,when the
time's right i'll do 'em.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,200
is right now!

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,820
there needs to be retribution.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,220
they're gonna die
anyway,might as well be by you.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,320
bravo team,what's your eta on b ward?

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,460
minutes,boss.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,460
you got seconds.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,580
we've gotta get to the
hostages before they do.

10
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,070
she is gonna keep you in
here as long as she lives.

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,790
you do this now,finish
it,no one knows it's you.

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,070
she doesn't show up to
your parole board hearings.

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,040
it's your shot to get out.

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,250
- no!
- let me put it another way!

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,690
you kill her or i kill you; your choice.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,460
so... anton burrows,you've been
incarcerated now for 15 years,

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,690
and this is your fourth appeal
for parole,is that right?

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,990
yes,ma'am.

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,080
and you feel you've been rehabilitated?

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,450
i've tried.

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,820
tried?what,mr. burrows?

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,470
to understand... what i did.

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,420
so i can learn from
it; be a better person.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,870
it says here that you have
become something of an artist.

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,060
participation in therapeutic
activities,that's very positive.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,010
yes,it is.

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,440
do you have something you could show us?

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,070
i... i-i'd rather not.

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,400
all right.

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,050
i-i brought something.

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,310
a statement.go ahead.

32
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,120
"to the amiri family.

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,870
there are no words hat
can express how sorry i am

34
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,400
for what i did to your
family and to mr. amiri.

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,390
i know and you know that...

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,360
there's nothing i can say or do
that will bring mr.amiri back.

37
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,250
i want you to know that i-i'd do anything if i
could go back and change what happened that day.

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,780
ms.amiri,this parole board has
all of your letters on record,

39
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,730
describing the pain that your family
has suffered since mr. burrows' crime.

40
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,860
is there any further statement

41
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,920
that you would like to make at this time
regarding mr.burrows' request for parole?

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,070
what i would like to say... i can't.

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,970
not in front of my mother.

44
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,100
i congratulate mr.burrows on
his success in the visual arts,

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,720
and on his performance for us today.

46
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,920
he says he's "changed"?

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,480
that's nice; we haven't.

48
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,550
in 15 years,it's been the same
life,the same feeling,day after day.

49
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,700
i had so little time with my father,i
can barely remember what he looks like.

50
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:07,390
but i know he was a kind man,a gentle
man,and he was slaughtered by this... animal.

51
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,680
i want him to
die,alone,like my father did.

52
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,740
you don't know what
happened,you don't know me!

53
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,800
i know he meant nothing to you,nothing!

54
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,190
and he was the only father i had!

55
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,950
guards!

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,960
what do you need me to tell you?!

57
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,000
what do you... what
do you want from me?!

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,050
what do you need to hear me say?!

59
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,930
anton,calm down!

60
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,380
and i'll be at your next parole
hearing and the next one...

61
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,990
get him out to the yard,cool him off.

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,240
until you're dead!do you understand me?!

63
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,010
i'll escort these folks outta here.

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,750
they're transferring warshaw
to maximum lockdown tomorrow.

65
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,880
i know.we're going today.

66
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,620
today?are you sure?

67
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,720
we got everything we need.crew's
up to speed.word's already out.

68
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,190
get it started.

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,920
all right,boys,put your cards down.

70
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,700
let's get this started,right now.

71
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,980
follow my lead.

72
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,670
you two doing okay?

73
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,900
we're fine,thank you.

74
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,830
i don't buy that crap either.

75
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,360
you know,they got a book out on how to write
these "boo-hoo" statements to the victims?

76
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,410
what's that?

77
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,800
this is potter,what's the alarm?

78
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,060
- follow me.
- what's going on?

79
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,450
just follow me now!come on,we gotta go.

80
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,750
gimme your money! gimme your money!

81
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,490
get out of my store!

82
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,970
get outta here,man.open
the door!open the door!

83
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,210
for god's sake,open the door!

84
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,570
everybody knows what to do.

85
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,540
break into the box,gear up.

86
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,250
find me some phones.

87
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,050
carter!carter!carter!

88
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,340
we got visitors,hallway 8.

89
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,390
grab 'em; they may come in handy.go.

90
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,350
anything you can!find me a phone!

91
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,460
okay,we've got multiple hostages
and 75 to 100 inmates involved.

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,990
we're looking for
knives,shivs,shanks,improvised maces.

93
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,080
everything is a weapon,so we're strictly
less-lethal: gas,rubber bullets,tasers.

94
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,510
a prison riot and we're less-lethal?

95
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,610
- no firearms in the prison.
- yes

96
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,050
you think it's bad now?throw
a loaded gun into the mix.

97
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,820
and us up against 100 cons
with shanks and shivs isn't?

98
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,330
come on,you ever get hit by a
rubber bullet?take anybody down.

99
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,390
that's good.'cause it's not like we're running into
a place with a dozen guys we've put away or anything.

100
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,580
all we know is it appears
to have started in the yard;

101
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,000
one inmate attacked another unprovoked,the
guards intervened,and things escalated from there.

102
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,610
we'll setup command post here.

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,590
any casualties reported so far?

104
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,230
so far only the inmate and a
guard who was attacked in the yard,

105
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,520
but i've got 3 guards unaccounted for.

106
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,180
they've blacked out cctv cameras,so
we've got a lot of blind spots.

107
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,110
we've been trying to lock down the
wings,but they've disabled the main control.

108
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,770
so all the prisoners
are out of their cells?

109
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,450
except for the ones in maximum lockdown.

110
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,890
okay,folks,priority here is containment.

111
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,450
let's look at the floor plans.

112
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,210
there's a guard station on each wing.

113
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,820
now can we do a manual
lockdown from those stations?

114
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,600
yeah,it's the only way.they've taken the
inner control room; it overrides us here.

115
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,350
taking over 4 guard
stations?letting everyone loose?

116
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,190
this is looking more planned
than spontaneous to me.

117
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,010
warden,how many guards can you give us?

118
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,370
we got 20 already
inside,there's more coming in.

119
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,200
okay,good.

120
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,370
sam,head up alpha team
with jules and spike.

121
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
leah,wordy,you're with me,bravo.

122
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,270
we clear and contain
wing by wing,a through d.

123
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,190
warden,we're gonna use
your guards as backup.

124
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,470
maximum caution.

125
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,140
these gentlemen have
already lost their freedom,

126
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,180
they won't win friends by being
co-operative with us here today.

127
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,620
we're gonna need you on comm,warden.

128
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,020
this your pa?

129
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,180
this is sergeant gregory parker with
the police strategic response unit.

130
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,980
attention all inmates,tactical teams

131
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,940
and reinforcements to the guards are
being deployed throughout the facility.

132
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,790
they have been instructed to take all
necessary steps to resolve this disturbance.

133
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,700
if you return immediately to your
cells,there will be no further repercussions.

134
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,430
sergeant,problem.

135
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,050
who are they,warden?

136
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,650
there was a parole hearing today.

137
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,070
that looks like the victim's family;
they didn't make it out in time.

138
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,820
okay,team,we've got civilians inside.

139
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,740
"a" wing hallway.

140
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,930
sam,new priority.

141
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,810
alpha team to "a"
wing,civilians at risk.

142
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,170
we're to stay less lethal?

143
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,320
until you hear otherwise.let's go.

144
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,850
all right,warden,you run the show here.

145
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,840
any idea what triggered this thing?

146
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,510
we've got good services
here,we're pretty progressive,

147
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,880
- we're not overcrowded...
- yeah,but how about who might be behind it?

148
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,860
well,i haven't had any prisoner
grievances in the last ten months.

149
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,660
they take all their grievances to you?

150
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,810
no,of course not.

151
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,090
then how about telling me about some
of the power players you got in here.

152
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,370
multiple stab wounds,we
have to move him.

153
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,420
boss,we've got the injured inmate.

154
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,570
multiple stab wounds to the chest.

155
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,240
any identifying marks or tattoos?

156
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,480
picture coming your way.

157
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,260
boss,we gotta get him outta here
fast,i'm gonna send him to the e.m.t.s.

158
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,540
- hey,you gotta come here.
- stay where you are!

159
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,240
do not move! do not move!

160
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,280
okay,okay,okay.

161
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,500
they got the guards.

162
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,330
where?

163
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,900
they took 3 guards to "c" wing.

164
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,540
- who took them?
- i didn't see their faces.

165
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,040
you sure about that?

166
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,830
look,i don't need that kinda trouble.

167
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,230
move it.boss,we may have
location on the missing guards.

168
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,050
i'm taking an alternate
route to get the amiris out.

169
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,140
back off,carter.

this is anton burrows,we
have a list of demands.

288
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,720
send us someone out here
who can make decisions.

289
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,960
i know him.

290
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,130
boss,i know him.back in the day,when i
was at 41 division,patrolling gangland

291
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,180
who'd he run with?

292
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,530
he wasn't a gangbanger,he
was more a hang-around.

293
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,120
there's something you should know.

294
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,450

four times?why?

298
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,900

victim's family,the amiri's,

299
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,220
they attend and they make
sure he doe't get out.

308
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,120

313
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,760
anton,i trusted your word once.

314
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,840
they're safe,i swear to you.

315
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,650
i hope so.

316
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,400
anton,i kw who they are.

317
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,330
we demand the following:

318
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,220
increase to two the number
of conjugal visits per moh.

319
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,070
larger number of spac
available for work detail.

320
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,240
three: creation of a prisoner's
advocacy board to addss inmate concerns.

321
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,440
all this for conjugal visits?

322
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,670
there's gotta be
something more going on.

323
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,020
that's it?

324
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,190
for now.

325
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,590
but this thing's not
over until we sait is.

326
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,270
don't forget that.

327
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,420
anton,if anythg happens
to those hostages...

328
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,750
the only way something happens to those
hostages is if you come in here looking for them.

329
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,440
noget us what we want;
you don't have much time.

330
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,130
remember the ridgestone
towers,back  the days?

331
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,280
that's exact what you're looking at
here,unless we get some satisfaction.

332
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,820
you unrstand?do you understand me?!

333
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,240

335
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,310

336
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,750

337
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,290

time.

339
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,180
not if we're gonna sto a breakout.

340
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,180
where are you taking us?

341
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,180
where the boss wants us to go.

342
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,620
move.

343
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,410
the guy right there.

344
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,470
he's trying hard to look
like anton's sidekick.

345
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,320
okay,it's the other way around.warden?

346
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,920
if sloan keller's behind the riot,then this
isn't just about a list of minor grievances.

347
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,640
well,does a breakut make sense?

348
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,870
well,sloan thinks big.

349
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,690
- eie,what's making you feel so sure?
- he brought up the ridgestone towers.

350
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,280
- and?
- gang bust.

351
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,620
a big boss,it was the west end
crew.we had 'em holed up in a standoff.

352
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,850
when we finally went in,they were gone.

353
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,090
they'd cut through the walls
in all the oter apartments.

354
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,820
so sloan wants to break out,but first he triggers a
riot so that the place is surrounded by cops?smart.

355
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,630
the fact that they're here kinda
suggest they're not master criminals.

356
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,430
well,maybe he didn't trigger the
riot.maybe he's just capitalizing on it.

357
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,000
nah,it feels like it was part of a plan.

358
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,400
you sure anton's not playing you?

359
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,340
i know how it sounds.

360
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,680
i got a feeling he's on the level.

361
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,890
where do you figure
they're staging this?

362
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,470
well,"a" and "c" is locked down.

363
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,030
so it's gonna be "b" or "d.

364
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,100
" "d" has the most exposed
ll leading to the outside.

365
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,620
i've got team four positioned
along the perimeter.

366
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,860
so,no one's going anywhere.

367
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,190
all right,what kind of
eyes do we got in there.

368
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,410
couple of cameras is all;
they've knocked the others out.

369
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,780
all right,let's take a
look at "d" wing.entrances?

370
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,580
there's a hallway that
runs to it from here.

371
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,940
comes out right in the back of "d" wing.

372
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,460
so we got the element of surprise.

373
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,040
wordy,spike,you're with me.

374
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,450
- sam...
- we'll grill for intel.

375
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,140
yeah,we're gonna start with the inmates.

376
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,360
let's go.

377
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,120
eddie.one second.

378
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,130
i took a look at anton's file.

379
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,270
it says that anton's lawyer contacted you
at his sentencing as a character witness.

380
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,580
anything i need to know?

381
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,410
you checking up on me or...?

382
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,440
no.jt doing a background.

383
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,400
we grew up in the same neighbourhood.

384
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,710
malvern,right?

385
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,060
yeah.

386
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,570
tough crowd.

387
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,140
look,my folks and his
folks were friends.

388
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,080
he was a little bit younger than me and when his
dad died,he got mixed up with the wrong crowd.

389
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,140
my old maasked me to look out for him.

390
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,190
he's a good kid going off the rails?

391
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,300
he was a good kid.

392
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,450
he was a great kid,he had a big heart.

393
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,640
a rookie uniform...
trying to save the wor,

394
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,970
so i went to his mother and i went to his
teachers and i said,i'll look out for him.

395
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,460
i'll look out for him!

396
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,010
and then one night... and one night i get
a call from a buddy of mine in homicide.

397
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,670
there's a shooting down at...
kingstonoad,convenience store.

398
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,470
that's not your fault.

399
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,580
it doesn't matter.it doesn't matter.

400
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,190
i thought he could beat the odds.

401
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,000
eddie... edd?

402
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,570
do you believe what
anton's telling you now?

403
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,180
i don't know if he's
lling the truth or not,

404
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,310
but i do kno that he coulda killed
those hostages by now if he wanted to.

405
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,520
when they meet those demands,i
mean,what're we gonna do then?

406
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,480
well,we'll make more demands,and
more,until our work here is done.

407
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,600
i thought we were busting out?

408
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,890
who asked you to think?

409
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,590
get back to your pets.

410
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,010
there's no breakout?

411
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,630
sure there is.

412
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,500
for anyone who wan to run straight
into the arms of a swat team.

413
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,440
bomb's good to go.how're
we doing on the blood's?

414
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,730
they've taken care of all four capins.

415
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,840
warshaw's the lastone.

416
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,950
good.

417
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,260
let's go!right there!right there!

418
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,920
up against the wa!hands on
the wall!hands on the wall!

419
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,460
up where i can see 'em!

420
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,310
wordy and  do not move!

421
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,600
don't move! don't move!
all right,let's go.

422
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,330
get 'em outta here.

423
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,390
get 'em outta here.

424
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,160
outta here,now!

425
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,710
this doesn't make any sense.

426
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,160
why?

427
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,230
the bomb,it's good to go,it's set up
really smart,it's solid piece of work.

428
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,440
but it's lame.

429
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,130
what?what do you mean?

430
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,360
i mean it's just propane.

431
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,280
the kind of explosion you're gonna get
from this,y'll get a big flash,a big boom.

432
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,450
but a flash isn't gonna take out a wall.

433
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,940
you need somethin' with actual force,and
this just... it doesn't have any.

434
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,560
spike,those guys looked
ike they were good to go.

435
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,590
well,everything about this looks
good to go,but to go nowhere.

436
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,170
- unless...
- unless the big boom was e whole point.

437
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,240
distraction?

438
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,100
eddie,we've got a
situation in the commissary.

439
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,680
alpha's on their
way,you better move fast.

440
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,150
bomb's diffused,boss.we're on our way.

441
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,500
what happens now?

442
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,550
you've made your demands,now what?

443
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,240
i don't know.

444
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,560
i'm sorry.

445
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,540
- hush,my daughter.

446
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,260
what she said about you
today,you have to understand.

447
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,940
i know.

448
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,320
you know what?

449
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,930
you don't want to hurt us,do you?

450
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,440
why'd you have to come here?

451
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,300
because you killed my father.

452
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,750
left him to die alon you belong here.

453
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,780
ii belonged here,you'd already be dead.

454
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,670
why did you kill my husband?

455
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,700
we know why
- for money,for...

456
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,430
tell me.tell me.

457
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,450
and not what you tell them to get out.

458
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,210
the truth.

459
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,680
why?

460
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:05,590
uh,the place i grew up,either you
get with a ng or the gang gets you.

461
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:14,930
my mom... this... this
cop,they tried to keep me out.

462
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,230
i tried too.

463
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,050
but i just got tired...

464
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:31,480
of trying,of bng scared all the time.

465
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,400
so these guys say to me,"you wanna
get with something,something good?

466
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,330
something strong?

467
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,140
get with us.

468
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,730
see that corner store
over on kingston road?

469
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,310
you gotta rob it.

470
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,790
the guy there,he's used to it.

471
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,360
" give me the money.gimme the money!

472
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:07,200
it was just the way in,you know;
to show they could trust me.

473
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,340
i wanted that so bad...

474
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,070
just to be with something.

475
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,670
so i went in.i had the gun they ga me.

476
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,730
i mean,that store had been hit
ten,twelve times already that year.

477
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,360
gimme the money!

478
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,350
get out of my store!

479
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:46,040
all i wanted was the money.

480
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:57,060
but i guess he was just sick of being
robbed,of being afraid all the time.

481
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,450
but... i did it.

482
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:14,440
ihot and i killed him
because i was afraid.

483
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,140
th's the only "why" i can think of.

484
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,020
i-i killed your father...

485
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,680
and there's nohing i
can do to take it back.

486
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,050
but he didn't die alone.

487
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,400
please don't die.

488
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,350
boss,we got three more victims.

489
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,110
all prisoners.

490
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,960
this was never about a breakout.

491
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,210
they all have the same tattoo.

492
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,970
yeah,these victims are all
satan's blood: leaders,enforcers.

493
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,410
the ones you want to hit when
you're attempting a takeover.

494
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,610
so they triggered a riot
to keep the guards busy.

495
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,840
takntage of chaos to get to his enemies.

496
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,030
tries to distract us with
bogus bombs and bogus demands.

497
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,910
makes sense
- king of the empire.

498
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,700
that's a whole lot more power than
sloan would have in the outside world.

499
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,970
and it's a day on the
inside no one'll forget.

500
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,970
warden,how many other
satan's blood untouchables?

501
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,590
after those guys?just
the top man,terry warshaw.

502
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,860
we got him in custody?

503
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,030
no,he's in "b" wing.

504
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,270
all right,we're on the move.

505
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,080
oss,upload ua photo on the fly.

506
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,060
copy.

507
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,290
that's your man.

508
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,810
boss,we split up into alpha and bravo.

509
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,370
we need to get those hostages secured
before they get a hold of warshaw.

510
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,130

we gotta get to him bere they do.

513
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,950
he's the grand prize.

514
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,980
with warshaw gone,sloan's
ot what he wants.

515
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,360
when he's got what he wants,he's got
no reason to let the hostages live.

516
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,150
we got you,dead man.

517
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,350
you're dead meat,warshaw.

518
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,200
make your mo,man.

519
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,660
what the hell did you
say to that cop,burrows?

520
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,300
you were there,you heard me.

521
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,180
what i heard now was the
sound of a mb not going off.

522
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,430
cops must've got to it
before,means they found out.

523
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,510
means w have a rat.

524
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,550
yeah?well,let's go find him.

525
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,030
oh,i think we already have.

526
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,600
oh,yeah?and it couldn't be the 20
other goons you got working for you.

527
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,450
but if that's the way
you feel,make your move.

528
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,540
but a minute!ke oh,come on.

529
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,760
- okay,sloan,i'm telling you,i didn't...

530
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,100
it's either gonna be all good or 's not.

531
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,510
then i'll hear what you have to say.

532
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,910
so the bomb wasn't about a breakout.

533
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,130
it was saved as their biggest distraction
for their biggest target,warshaw.

534
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,930
boss,it looks like nton played me.

535
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,110

545
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,260
cops got 'em before they
could finish warshaw.

546
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,840
he's in protective
custody now.that's it.

547
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,280
so... things didn't
go all our way today.

548
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,420

549
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,340
so,my question is,which
side are you gonna be on?

550
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,450
same  always,man,my own.

551
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,750
no,you're gonna need protection,especially now
that satan's blood knows how close you ande are.

552
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,870
so,you are gonna show me that
yore still a guy that i can trust.

553
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,770
yeah,man,i told you,when the
time's right i'll take 'em out.

554
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,880

555
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,190
they're gonna die
anyways,might as well be by you.

556
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,670
wordy?

557
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,090
yeah,two seated,not
moving,small; it's gotta be them.

558
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,540
bosswe've located the hostages.

559
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,110
that door's pretty heavy,if
there are obstacles...

560
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,080
yeah,the hostages will be dead
before we get the door open.

561
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,800
there's gotta be ather way.

562
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,280
doesn't lookike it,eddie.

563
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,010
warden,what is this room?

564
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,690
that's an old weight room.

565
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
but it's been closed
over a year for renos.

566
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,030
it's the only part of the
prison that's just brick.

567
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,960
posed an escape risk even
though it's four-storeysp.

568
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,970
well,if they can break
out,we can break in.

569
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,370
hey,spike,how do you feel
about explosive entry?

570
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,990

00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,770
you do this now.finish
it,no one knows it's you.

572
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,860
she doesn't show up to
your parole board hearings.

573
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,840
this is your only shot to get out.

574
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,190

575
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,830

you kill her or i kill you.

576
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,600
