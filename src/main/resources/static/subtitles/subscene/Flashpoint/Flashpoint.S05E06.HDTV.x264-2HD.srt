1
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,218
Kate!

2
00:00:09,253 --> 00:00:11,421
I need you to open this door
right now!

3
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:12,521
Ungh!

4
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:16,592
<i>Don't do this!
You're too close to this thing!</i>

5
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:17,860
<i>You're not seeing this right.</i>

6
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:19,862
A couple more of those,
detective...

7
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:22,764
And I'll open right up.

8
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:25,367
Now I need you
to open the door.

9
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,102
Boss, visual's up.

10
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,776
No, Kate!

11
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:49,290
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>

12
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,292
<i>what you would think
about this.</i>

13
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:55,628
You would make a joke,
that much I know.

14
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:57,130
You'd tease me about it...

15
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,634
about me being here,
talking to a hunk of stone.

16
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:08,107
I know people talk about grief
and...

17
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:11,043
They say that it takes time.

18
00:01:12,312 --> 00:01:14,846
I'm waiting, Evan.

19
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:20,452
It doesn't seem fair though,
right?

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,421
That the 3 years
you have been gone

21
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:25,023
take up so much more
of my heart

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,125
than the seventeen
we spent together.

23
00:01:38,904 --> 00:01:40,237
You shouldn't be here.

24
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:42,672
No one knows I'm here.

25
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,207
<i>He'd be 21 today.</i>

26
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:48,178
It doesn't go away, does it?

27
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,179
<i>You know what I miss?</i>

28
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:51,014
Luke, please.

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,584
<i>We can't do this.</i>

30
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:57,319
You know,
I have something for you.

31
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:59,522
<i>That bike chain bracelet
Evan made,</i>

32
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:02,525
it's been broken
for the longest time.

33
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:07,196
I finally got around
to replacing the pin.

34
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:09,765
He wore it every day.

35
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:11,500
<i>He'd want you to have it.</i>

36
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:13,301
You keep it.

37
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,469
<i>It's yours.</i>

38
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,904
Mrs. A, I think...

39
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:20,741
this can't happen again.

40
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,586
Where is he?

41
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,620
Briefing room.

42
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,122
Hold up. Take a breath.

43
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,756
A street fight, Ed?

44
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,924
We don't know the details.

45
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,759
I spoke to Terry from 52.
He took the call,

46
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,328
a bunch of kids fighting.

47
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,596
Someone swinging
a hockey stick.

48
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,230
Apparently. What's he
doing getting mixed up

49
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,231
in stuff like that? Greg,

50
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,399
you're gonna ask him.

51
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,333
You're damn
right, I'm gonna...

52
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,301
All right, hold up.

53
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,502
You go in hot right now,

54
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,237
it's not gonna help
the situation at all.

55
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,873
Well, I don't wanna help
the situation.

56
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,911
I wanna take a paddle
to the little punk.

57
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,546
When does this get easier?

58
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,348
Well, I hear that they become
a little more manageable

59
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:05,283
when they're... They're 40.

60
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,228
Hey, you know that
beemer that came in yesterday?

61
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,329
The Enduro?

62
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:20,831
Yeah. Got it running.

63
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:22,733
The engine was full
of sand, it was shot.

64
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,101
- It was.
- That's it, sweetie.

65
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,469
Now it's not.

66
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,070
<i>You're a genius,
kid, you know that?</i>

67
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,905
When I was your age,
it would've taken me weeks.

68
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,907
'Course things were
different then.

69
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,009
Yeah. Horsepower
was actual horses...

70
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,410
Coal was the way of the future.

71
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:35,378
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:36,946
Don't get cocky, smartass.

73
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,014
Sorry, honey.

74
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:40,183
You didn't hear that,
all right?

75
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:43,819
Hi. Steven.

76
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:44,954
Boss?

77
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,323
Look, uh, sweetie,

78
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,892
<i>I want you to go out
in the backyard, okay?</i>

79
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,427
Play with the other kids,
all right?

80
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:53,562
You have fun.

81
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:58,133
Hey, I hear there's a meet
and greet in Chatham.

82
00:03:58,201 --> 00:03:59,401
New clients.

83
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,336
Yeah? Where'd you hear that?

84
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,573
All I'm saying is,
now that I've been promoted,

85
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:06,574
maybe I should come.

86
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:10,811
Yeah, we'll see.

87
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,059
Luke, get back here!

88
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:28,995
Luke, get back here!

89
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,464
<i>Come on, Luke!</i>

90
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:44,743
Hey.

91
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:47,879
Ahh...

92
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,617
You okay?

93
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:53,017
I didn't start it.

94
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:54,952
Team one, hot call!

95
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,322
Look, go home.
Ice it, all right?

96
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,323
We'll talk later, all right?

97
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,924
Dad, I didn't start it.

98
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,158
Dean, you know what?

99
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:03,628
The older I get,
the less that matters to me.

100
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,298
Just go home. Now.

101
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:16,340
<i>Car bomb,
284 Mapledawn Road.</i>

102
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:17,574
<i>Suspect fled on a motorcycle,</i>

103
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:20,043
<i>last seen headed eastbound
on Bloor.</i>

104
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:22,178
Reports of a blue El Camino
in pursuit.

105
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:23,714
Spike, Jules, scene
of the explosion.

106
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:26,482
Sam, Leah,
let's find that bike.

107
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:39,129
There you are...

108
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:49,738
Winnie, how far away is EMS?

109
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:51,640
They just passed east mall.

110
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:52,441
Over here, please!
My daughter...

111
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,509
What's her name?

112
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:55,744
Alex. It's her leg.

113
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,111
Alex, can you hear me?

114
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,881
Clear back! Stay back! Back!

115
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:01,483
That's shrapnel
from the explosion.

116
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:04,318
Looks like she twisted it
when she fell.

117
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:05,954
<i>Vehicle spotted
at Queensway and Kipling.</i>

118
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:07,154
We're close.

119
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,457
Sam, come north;
We'll close him in.

120
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:10,558
<i>Copy that.</i>

121
00:06:15,363 --> 00:06:17,498
Yeah, it's me.
Listen, there was a bomb.

122
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:19,366
They got Steven.

123
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,569
Yeah, I'm on the Queensway
following the guy.

124
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:23,670
Ah, dammit.

125
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:32,478
What's happening?!

126
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:35,347
<i>Alex, can you hear me?
Alex?</i>

127
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:37,282
Hypovolemic shock;
She's lost a lot of blood.

128
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:38,450
Just hold this down here.

129
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,585
Okay...

130
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,586
Keep the pressure on.

131
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,188
<i>Okay!</i>

132
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:45,223
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

133
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,594
Alex?

134
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,230
1, 2, 3...

135
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:54,799
Boss, the bomb went off
at a children's birthday party.

136
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:58,803
<i>Two deceased -
Mary-Ann and Steven Miller.</i>

137
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:01,939
Alex! Alex, can you hear me?

138
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:04,174
1, 2, 3...
Keep the pressure on!

139
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,477
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

140
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:08,579
Come on, Alex.

141
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:11,615
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

142
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:15,986
Alex, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Alex?

143
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:17,420
What... what happened?

144
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,421
You're gonna be okay.

145
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:19,856
Thank God...

146
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,658
Ma'am, she's in good hands,
okay?

147
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:25,094
Can you tell me
what happened here today?

148
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:26,762
Sorry. Ma'am?

149
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:27,896
I can't.

150
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,740
Team one, another sighting -
Queen East.

151
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,409
Heading north -
we're blocks away.

152
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:48,349
What did you get, Jules?

153
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:49,517
It doesn't add up.

154
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:50,818
Assassination, broad daylight,

155
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:51,953
a house full of kids.

156
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,288
Like someone's making a point.

157
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:54,622
Yeah, but to who?

158
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,257
This place says
welcome to Mayberry.

159
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,258
Did you get anything
from witnesses?

160
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:58,492
That's the other thing.

161
00:07:58,526 --> 00:07:59,893
A house full of people
and nobody saw a thing.

162
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,429
Yeah, I got the same thing
from the kid's mom.

163
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,332
Something's not right.

164
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,451
Think it's a hobby?

165
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,820
No. I think we're
dealing with bikers.

166
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:31,556
Boss, the hosts of this party

167
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:34,526
are members of the Brigadier
Motorcycle Club.

168
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,094
Okay, team, extreme caution.

169
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,629
Copy that.

170
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:42,167
<i>Boss, I got a call
from detective Kate Andrews,</i>

171
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:43,701
organized crime division.

172
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:44,702
Not a good time, Winnie.

173
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,903
She says it's urgent.

174
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,171
<i>Direct order;
You're to take the call.</i>

175
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,172
<i>Sergeant Parker?</i>

176
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:49,406
Listen, detective,

177
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:50,574
<i>I'm in the middle
of a bomb investigation</i>

178
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:52,676
<i>and chasing two
gangland soldiers.</i>

179
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,411
No, one gangland soldier.

180
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,113
The young man in the car
works for me.

181
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:58,815
<i>He's a CI. He's my asset.</i>

182
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:12,795
We got gunfire.

183
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,797
Agh!

184
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:18,633
Agh!

186
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,226
<i>Sam, Leah, go
direct to gunfire,</i>

187
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,627
we're coming north.

188
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,970
<i>Stop! Right there, stop!</i>

189
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,839
Sam, we've got an active
shooter coming your way.

190
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:13,911
Ungh!

191
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:20,250
I think you got him.

192
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,386
You doing all right, son?

193
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:24,621
Yeah.

194
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:26,389
Winnie, I need you
to connect me to...

195
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:27,857
<i>Luke! Luke!</i>

196
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:31,127
Never mind.
Detective Andrews?

197
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:32,829
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

198
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:34,363
I'm fine.
I'm fine, Mrs. A.

199
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:35,965
What the hell
were you thinking, huh?

200
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,433
<i>You could've been killed.</i>

201
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:38,467
<i>Well, I was trying
to keep eyes on the guy,</i>

202
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,469
like you said.
I said stay clear.

203
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:42,171
Get intel, but stay clear.

204
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:43,639
Mrs. A, he ambushed me.

205
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:44,840
Detective
Andrews, I'm Greg Parker.

206
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:45,974
This is Ed Lane.

207
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:47,209
How're you doing?

208
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,210
That man killed
in the explosion...

209
00:10:48,277 --> 00:10:49,244
Steven Miller...

210
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:50,145
is he a member
of the Brigadiers?

211
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:51,479
He was the leader.

212
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:52,480
<i>What does that
tell you, detective?</i>

213
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:53,815
<i>Is this a war? Looks that way.</i>

214
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,951
The Brigadiers have been
expanding their operations,

215
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:57,052
they've been encroaching
on rival turf.

216
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,286
Which rivals?

217
00:10:58,354 --> 00:10:59,820
Another bike
club - Devil's Guard.

218
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:02,356
<i>They run a lot of meth,
weapons, extortion...</i>

219
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,158
<i>all areas the brigs
have been getting into.</i>

220
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:05,826
Detective, the bomber
didn't have any patches

221
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,494
or any gang markings
or anything.

222
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:08,863
Now you're thinking old-school.

223
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,965
<i>Nowadays, these guys keep
a white-collar profile.</i>

224
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,166
<i>They mow their lawns.</i>

225
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,667
They send their kids
to French immersion.

226
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:14,969
<i>The hogs and the leathers,</i>

227
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:17,336
they only come out
on special occasions.

228
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:20,706
The shooter's not talking.
No ID.

229
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:23,143
I'm sending you a photo now.

230
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,013
Devil's Guard?

231
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:28,648
Could've brought him in
from another chapter,

232
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:30,116
hired someone unaffiliated.

233
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,550
<i>I found something
in the bombers jacket.</i>

234
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,985
An IED detonator.

235
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:36,721
It's rf controlled.
Short range, maybe 200 feet.

236
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:38,090
Why a kid's party?

237
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:39,391
Send a message.

238
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:40,759
Devil's Guard letting us know,

239
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,527
"we can get you any place,
any time..."

240
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,065
It's Brian.

241
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,436
Hey, Brian.

242
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,971
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry,

243
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,340
I just, I...
I wanted to get the guy,

244
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,109
but the cops showed up.

245
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:00,311
No, no, no. I got outta there,

246
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,013
made myself scarce.

247
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:05,715
Okay. Yeah, you got it.

248
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:08,618
Walter's called
an emergency meeting,

249
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:09,786
right now, at the clubhouse.

250
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,054
They want me there.

251
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:13,089
Well, that's not
happening, so relax.

252
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:14,457
You know the dynamics,
detective,

253
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:15,458
<i>what's your guess?</i>

254
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:16,626
They're gonna hit back.

255
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,828
<i>Walter McHale was
second in command.</i>

256
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,029
<i>Now he's the lead,</i>

257
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,762
and he is not one
to back down from a fight.

258
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:21,763
Then we get ahead of it.

259
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:22,898
We bust open
their headquarters.

260
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:23,899
<i>We don't have the evidence.</i>

261
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:25,000
These guys are pros.

262
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,635
They don't store weapons
on site,

263
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:28,304
<i>and they keep
their noses clean.</i>

264
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:30,172
8 months I've been
all over them...

265
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,308
<i>not one single piece
of actionable intel.</i>

266
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:33,943
Send me back in.

267
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:34,944
I mean,
if we're gonna hit back,

268
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:36,077
I can get a time and place,

269
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:38,779
<i>that's actionable, right?</i>

270
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:41,382
Detective, I don't...

271
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,616
I don't wanna step
on your case here,

272
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,552
but you can't be
considering this.

273
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:46,154
Everyone in that clubhouse
is going to be amped up

274
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,155
and on high alert.

275
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:49,057
In his state right now,

276
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:51,192
can your CI keep playing the part?

277
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:55,562
What do you say, Luke?

278
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:56,897
You up for this?

279
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:58,798
Look, this could be the chance
we've been waiting for.

280
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,534
Get Brian, Walter, all of them.

281
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:02,769
You gotta let me try.

282
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,741
'Kay, let's wire him.
He's going in.

283
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:09,441
It gets hot, we can
bust that place wide open.

284
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,477
Spike, Jules,
all hands on deck.

285
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:25,991
We got razor wire,
crash barriers,

286
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:27,993
cameras at every entrance.

287
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,194
Door's reinforced steel.

288
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:30,828
Yeah, no
element of surprise.

289
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,397
Unless we make
our own doors.

290
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:33,932
Okay, the north
wall's got no cams.

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,100
<i>We stay out of line of sight.</i>

292
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,634
Breach charges. Jules with me.

293
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:38,503
Sam, Leah, up top. Let's move.

294
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:43,740
Luke's belt buckle comes
with a mic and a GPS tracker,

295
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:44,841
so we can hear everything

296
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,277
and know where he is
at all times.

297
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:47,577
It doesn't show.

298
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,146
Not unless you're really,
really looking for it.

299
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:50,814
<i>They'll ask you what
happened with the bomber.</i>

300
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:52,082
<i>You keep your story simple,</i>

301
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:53,550
stick as close to the truth
as possible.

302
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,386
Distress code is "bad deal."

303
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:58,187
Okay, yeah, I got it.
Bad deal.

304
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:01,024
Oh, uh, check,

305
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,259
<i>check, check, hello, goodbye.</i>

306
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:05,360
Good to go.

307
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,947
Luke,

308
00:14:26,014 --> 00:14:27,281
my team will be outside.

309
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:28,882
If anything goes wrong,
you just stay down,

310
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,318
we'll get you out safe, okay?

311
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:35,055
Do you know what your job
in there is, son?

312
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:36,722
Bring down the Brigadiers. No.

313
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,959
You get us a time
and the place of the retaliation

314
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:39,960
and that's it.

315
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,227
You get out, all right?

316
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:42,495
You don't go anywhere else,

317
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:44,230
you don't take any assignments,
understood?

318
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:48,835
Understood.

319
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:50,770
All right.

320
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:07,185
Okay...

321
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:17,962
So far so good.

322
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:28,438
We need to talk.

323
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:29,706
<i>Now.</i>

324
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,707
I'm not liking this.

325
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:33,076
He's okay... He's okay.

326
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:38,215
Luke.

327
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:41,283
We got a problem.

328
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,619
Eddie, standby for my go.

329
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:44,920
Alpha team in position.

330
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:47,189
Bravo team in position.

331
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:48,857
Walter, what's the problem?

332
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,493
Shut up.

333
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,195
Brian, come on, what
the hell's going on here?

334
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,197
The man told you to shut up,
Luke.

335
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:59,768
Brian gave
you a direct order to stay,

336
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:01,102
so you take off.

337
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,539
That guy killed Steve,
I had to try and get-

338
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:06,207
- Alpha team...
- Wait!

339
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,078
<i>He hasn't given the signal.</i>

340
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:11,212
He's fine.

341
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,583
He gave you an order!

342
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:17,385
<i>Are you a brigadier, Luke?</i>

343
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,920
Are you one of us?!

344
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:21,222
Look, I know I screwed up.

345
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,892
But I did this for Steve,

346
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,162
<i>for the Brigadiers.</i>

347
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,729
You don't like that,
you better kick me out now.

348
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:31,631
Because if someone
comes at us again,

349
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,468
I'm gonna do
the same damn thing.

350
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,208
All I needed to hear.

351
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,643
Get the guys together.

352
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:47,113
That's a brave kid.

353
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,414
Yeah, he is.

354
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:51,784
Look I was meaning to ask...
"Mrs. A?"

355
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,586
Luke called you that
in the alley.

356
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,888
I've known Luke
for a long time.

357
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:57,356
Friend of my son's.

358
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:58,558
<i>Luke didn't have
an ideal family life,</i>

359
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,192
so he came over a lot.

360
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:01,393
You know how that can be.

361
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,527
Sure.

362
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:04,762
What's your son think of this...

363
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:06,598
<i>you and his friend
working together?</i>

364
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:09,000
My son died three years ago.

365
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,001
I'm sorry.

366
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,669
Thank you.

367
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:12,770
Was he ill?

368
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,307
<i>Boating accident.</i>

369
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:17,108
Well, that must've been
difficult.

370
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,209
It was.

371
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:23,314
Walter you've all heard
what's happened.

372
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,549
<i>It's a real shame.</i>

373
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:28,919
It's a tragedy
that it had to come to this.

374
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:32,422
This club is at a crossroads -
you all know that.

375
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,657
We all loved
and respected Steve.

376
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:37,827
He was our president,
our friend, our brother.

377
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:41,364
But he was blind...
Blind to our enemies,

378
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:43,466
blind to our opportunities...

379
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,602
Doesn't sound like
a war speech, does it?

380
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,036
<i>This is the point I
was trying to make with Steve</i>

381
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,570
for months now.

382
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:49,938
Many of you have.

383
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:53,609
Sorry to say...
He never did see the light.

384
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:57,112
<i>I wish that he had,
I really do,</i>

385
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,880
<i>but take a look around you,
gentlemen.</i>

386
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:01,450
See who's here, who isn't here.

387
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:03,685
<i>These are your real brothers,</i>

388
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,086
the ones standing beside you
right now.

389
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,524
Everybody else...
Like I said, crossroads.

390
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:13,361
<i>Some of us will be going
in one direction,</i>

391
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:15,129
some of us in another.

392
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:17,898
Anybody got a problem
with that?

393
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,534
He's not talking about
going to battle.

394
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,268
He's talking
about taking over.

395
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:22,935
<i>He's talking about a purge.</i>

396
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:24,837
<i>If he's announcing it,
it's already in motion.</i>

397
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,105
How many targets
are still out there?

398
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,274
And where?

399
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:29,643
Geez, Brian...

400
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:30,977
Just keep your mouth
shut and your head down, okay?

401
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:32,812
You'll be fine.

402
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,114
Karl's not here. I know.

403
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:38,651
Dennis, Richard...
Are they all dead?

404
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,286
Good work, Luke.

405
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,388
Karl Borance, Dennis Barber,
Richard Breed.

406
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,556
Who are they?

407
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,226
Loyalists - of Steven Miller,

408
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,261
the assassinated
Brigadiers leader...

409
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,896
and now marked men.

410
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,050
Okay, team,
you heard the news.

411
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,485
The Brigadiers are
cleaning house.

412
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:06,087
We've got three targets.

413
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,521
<i>Spike's sending you photos.</i>

414
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:09,290
Spike, home
numbers, cell phones.

415
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,624
On it.

416
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:11,825
<i>If you wanted to
take out three guys</i>

417
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,993
without tipping your plan...

418
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,227
Make sure they're together.

419
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:16,263
And we know these guys
love bombs.

420
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,563
<i>Spike!</i>

421
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:19,232
<i>No answers
at home or at work.</i>

422
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,667
Cell phones are off,
but I'm getting a GPS ping back

423
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,303
<i>from Karl Borance's phone.</i>

424
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:25,471
He's southeast from here.

425
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:29,808
That's Dennis Barber's
restaurant.

426
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:31,010
It's downtown, lunch hour.

427
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,544
Pretty brash move.

428
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:33,946
Not if they're trying
to play it off as a gang war.

429
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,281
Gives them deniability.

430
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:36,181
Well, they've
shown they're not worried

431
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:37,616
about collateral damage.

432
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:38,918
Let's move.

433
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:40,485
Hey, I'm gonna stay back,

434
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:42,321
make sure Luke gets out
all right.

435
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,222
What's going on?

436
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:45,790
I don't know,
something about this...

437
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:47,225
Ed, you go. I got it.

438
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,326
Go.

439
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:53,831
Winnie, detective Andrews' son,

440
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:56,034
<i>what can you tell me about him?</i>

441
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:57,135
Evan Andrews.

442
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:59,370
Died at 17
in a boating accident.

443
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:00,470
The file's sealed
because the parties involved

444
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:01,771
were minors at the time.

445
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,206
'Kay, contact the officer
that was there.

446
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,008
Maybe he can give us
some more information.

447
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:06,709
<i>Sure.</i>

448
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:11,714
<i>Team, schematics of the
restaurant coming at you.</i>

449
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:12,849
<i>Spike, break this down for me.</i>

450
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,017
If we're dealing with
the same tech,

451
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:15,319
how's this go?

452
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,618
Real simple;
Bomber plants the device,

453
00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:17,586
<i>waits for the targets
to show up,</i>

454
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:19,055
<i>presses a button.</i>

455
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,289
It hasn't gone off yet.
What does that tell us?

456
00:20:20,357 --> 00:20:21,824
Best case,
someone had a change of heart.

457
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,092
<i>More likely...</i>

458
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:24,860
All three of the targets
aren't in place yet.

459
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:26,429
So we call ahead,
start clearing the place.

460
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:28,230
<i>Unless we supervise
the evacuation ourselves,</i>

461
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:29,365
<i>it's too risky.</i>

462
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:30,499
Patrons start running
out of there,

463
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,033
it's gonna cue the bomber.

464
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,301
<i>He's gonna take out whatever
target's are already there.</i>

465
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:34,902
And we show up with
the sirens blaring...

466
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:36,004
same story.

467
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,376
You all right?

468
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:42,477
Yeah.

469
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:45,046
These aren't easy times.

470
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:46,614
Had to be done, right?

471
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:48,315
Okay,
let's bring your guy in.

472
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:50,250
Hang on. Something's up.

473
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:51,718
<i>Tell you what...</i>

474
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:54,254
Walter and I have a loose end
to tie up.

475
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,688
You wanna be part of it?

476
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,690
I mean, you said you wanted
to step up.

477
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,226
Well, today would be
a good day for it...

478
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,397
chance to prove yourself
to the new regime.

479
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,898
Luke, no. Say no.

480
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:11,236
You know what? Never mind.

481
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,738
You've had a hell of a day.

482
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,740
Yeah.

483
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:19,544
I'm in.

484
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,646
No. No, no, no.
What's he doing?

485
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,982
He's giving us Walter;
That's what he's doing.

486
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,183
Not the plan, detective.

487
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,318
<i>Listen to me.</i>

488
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,451
This is our chance.

489
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,785
They're going on
an assassination run.

490
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,154
Which is why we
have to let it play out...

491
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,188
to protect the target.

492
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,456
You mean arrest your man.

493
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,258
Yes! Yeah, that too.

494
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,693
Sergeant,
nothing that happened today

495
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,062
can be traced back to Walter.

496
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,197
So far he can just walk away
from all of it.

497
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:44,467
If he orders this hit,
then we've finally got him.

498
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,505
My investigation, my call.

499
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:52,742
Eddie, CI's on the move
and we're following.

500
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:53,876
<i>What's your twenty?</i>

501
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:55,111
Boss, we're almost
at the restaurant.

502
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:06,388
Hang back, sergeant.
Tracking signal's strong.

503
00:22:06,423 --> 00:22:07,622
We'll follow at a distance.

504
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:14,963
<i>I know you think
I'm pushing him,</i>

505
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:16,364
but you really have
to trust me.

506
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:18,399
He knows what he's doing
and this is what he wants.

507
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:19,900
<i>Yeah? How can
you be sure of that?</i>

508
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:22,002
<i>Because I didn't recruit him.
He came to me.</i>

509
00:22:22,037 --> 00:22:23,671
He wanted to be a CI?

510
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:25,773
No, he wanted to change
his life around.

511
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:27,075
He knew I could help.

512
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:29,510
Well, you were the parent
in his life.

513
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:30,744
<i>You had mentioned it earlier</i>

514
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,512
that he didn't have
a very strong home life

515
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:34,281
and that he was
at your house a lot.

516
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:35,482
I helped out where I could.

517
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:36,583
He must have been grateful.

518
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:37,684
Sometimes.

519
00:22:40,754 --> 00:22:42,956
Okay, team, listen up.
Sam, you're on the trigger man.

520
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,824
<i>This guy's gotta have
a sight line to the restaurant.</i>

521
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:46,426
I want you to find him
and stop him.

522
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:47,826
All right, I'm on it.

523
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,228
<i>Leah, you're with me.
Back service door.</i>

524
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:51,029
Let's clear the place out
quick and quiet

525
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:52,030
<i>without tipping him off.</i>

526
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:53,265
Got it!

527
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,933
Jules, you're out front.
No lights, no sirens.

528
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:56,535
<i>You're looking for
the targeted bikers.</i>

529
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,270
Keeping 'em out
buys us more time inside.

530
00:22:58,305 --> 00:22:59,271
Copy. Spike?

531
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,006
Let me guess. I'm on bomb?

532
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:02,374
You're on bomb.

533
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:11,048
<i>There was one summer where
Evan and Luke got jobs at a garage.</i>

534
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:13,751
Brian Novak was their boss,

535
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:15,286
and when I got wind
of his affiliation

536
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:16,254
with the Brigadiers,

537
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:18,889
I... I just hit the roof.

538
00:23:18,924 --> 00:23:20,657
<i>I went driving over there,</i>

539
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:22,025
and I marched
both those boys out,

540
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,194
one in each hand.

541
00:23:24,262 --> 00:23:26,563
<i>I guess I thought
Luke got the message,</i>

542
00:23:26,598 --> 00:23:28,499
but um... A few months ago,

543
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:30,400
in the middle of the night,

544
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:32,969
Luke showed up at the station.

545
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:37,607
<i>Luke, it's 2 in the morning.</i>

546
00:23:37,674 --> 00:23:39,642
What're you doing here?

547
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:44,847
Whose is that?

548
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:45,881
Mine...

549
00:23:45,949 --> 00:23:47,450
<i>How long?</i>

550
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:48,551
Couple years...

551
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:49,552
<i>I got patched in this week.</i>

552
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:51,719
No, no, don't do that.

553
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:54,289
You just joined
a violent criminal gang...

554
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:55,624
<i>these are the people
I spend my whole life</i>

555
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:56,991
trying to put away.

556
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:58,726
Look, I'm in over my head,
Mrs. A.

557
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:00,061
<i>It's not...</i>

558
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,763
It's not at all
what I thought it would be.

559
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:02,597
Okay...

560
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:04,565
Look, I'm a fully patched
member of the Brigadiers.

561
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,168
I've got names, locations,
jobs.

562
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:08,669
<i>I can give you all of it.</i>

563
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:11,505
<i>He wanted out...</i>

564
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:12,773
<i>He realized he'd made
a mistake,</i>

565
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,076
<i>and he wanted my help
making things right.</i>

566
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,979
<i>You gotta
be clear about this, Luke.</i>

567
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:22,283
You go through this door,
you can't come back.

568
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,284
You understand that, right?

569
00:24:24,318 --> 00:24:25,385
I'm ready.

570
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:30,557
So who are we gonna see,
anyway?

571
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,325
Ron.

572
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:35,428
Who is it?

573
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:36,862
Ron McHale.
Walter's own cousin.

574
00:24:36,897 --> 00:24:38,264
Not a full-time member,
but still involved.

575
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:39,431
Always got along with Steven,

576
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,366
<i>and I should have
seen this coming.</i>

577
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:43,168
Yeah, I need
units at Ron McHale's house...

578
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:45,337
plain clothes, unmarked cars -
right away.

579
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:46,371
No. Go!

580
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:09,026
Yep.

581
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,128
Walter, it's Ron.

582
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,395
You were right.

583
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,464
Okay. Got it.

584
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:19,402
<i>That was Ron.</i>

585
00:25:19,437 --> 00:25:20,903
He's got company.

586
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:27,409
Luke's cover's blown.

587
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,444
What're you talking about?

588
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:29,845
It was a set-up, it was a test.

589
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,813
They suspected he was wired
and they fed us bad intel.

590
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:33,181
No! They would've searched him
in the clubhouse.

591
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:34,883
And we would've busted in
and saved him.

592
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,553
Oh my God.

593
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,096
Let's move! Go, go!

594
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,003
Everyone, can I have
your attention please!

595
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:58,939
<i>This is a police emergency.</i>

596
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:04,711
I need you to stay calm

597
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:06,713
<i>and exit through
the back door, please.</i>

598
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:08,815
<i>Exit through the back door!
Let's go, folks!</i>

599
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:16,389
Folks, please, now! Do it now!

600
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:18,791
<i>Let's go, ladies, let's go!
Here we go!</i>

601
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:20,259
<i>Through the back
of the building!</i>

602
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:21,560
<i>It's an emergency, folks!</i>

603
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:23,329
<i>If I can have you up and out!
Up and out!</i>

604
00:26:23,397 --> 00:26:24,697
<i>Let's go, people, let's go!</i>

605
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,131
Spike - there!

606
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,633
Mr. Barber? Yes.</i>

607
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:28,901
- This your restaurant?
- What's this all about?

608
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,135
<i>- This your usual table?
- Yes.</i>

609
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:31,303
You need to get outta here,
right now!

610
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,304
<i>Your lives are in danger.</i>

611
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:33,772
<i>Go! Go!</i>

612
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:35,840
Okay, two of
the targets are coming out.

613
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:37,342
Got the bomb!

614
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,243
Jules, the missing
target is Richard Breed.

615
00:26:39,312 --> 00:26:41,179
<i>The bomber's waiting
for Richard Breed.</i>

616
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:43,948
Copy.

617
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,924
Where are you...?

618
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:58,595
Okay, they're headed
north - just up there.

619
00:26:58,663 --> 00:26:59,963
Okay, turn right.

620
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,133
<i>Leave it! Drop everything!
Now! Come on!</i>

621
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,301
Let's go! Let's go,
gentlemen, let's go, now!

622
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,208
Ed, he's here!

623
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:13,676
He's down the block;
I can't intercept him

624
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:15,244
without the trigger man
seeing me.

625
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:16,679
<i>How long?</i>

626
00:27:16,714 --> 00:27:17,880
Sixty seconds - he's
halfway down the block.

627
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:19,748
We're not clear yet!
Sam, anything?

628
00:27:19,816 --> 00:27:20,849
Nothing.

629
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:34,529
Oh God...

630
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:40,601
I got him.

631
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:46,474
Thirty seconds, Ed.

632
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:48,308
Ed, when you clear out
the restaurant,

633
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:50,444
clear out the kitchen
and the street out front.

634
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:56,549
Fifteen seconds, Ed.

635
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:04,750
Digital counter-measure;

636
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,317
I'm not gonna be able
to move it!

637
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,657
<i>Ten seconds, Ed.</i>

638
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:18,463
I gotta go.

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,433
Richard Breed!

640
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,802
Let's go! Stay down!
Take cover!

641
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,138
Detonator... charges...

642
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:31,141
Do not go in there!
Stay where you are!

643
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:34,110
Power supply.

644
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:40,283
Drop it!

645
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:44,086
Bomb defused!

646
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:47,156
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

647
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,760
<i>There!</i>

648
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,829
Show me your hands!

649
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:55,897
Do it now!

650
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,567
Luke!

651
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,374
Where is he?!

652
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:32,131
Ungh! Where is he?

653
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:34,233
<i>I'd like to
talk to my lawyer.</i>

654
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:35,635
Ungh!

655
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:37,303
<i>Where is he, Brian?!</i>

656
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:39,205
Detective, you
need to step away.

657
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,206
Not now, Parker!

658
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:41,307
Kate, I know this is hard.

659
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:44,242
But we need clear heads
right now.

660
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:51,683
Keep him
inside and watch him.

661
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:52,851
You got it.

662
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,753
<i>Okay, Eddie, talk to me.</i>

663
00:29:54,787 --> 00:29:55,987
Boss, we're clear.

664
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,288
The targets are safe,
bomber's in custody.

665
00:29:57,357 --> 00:29:59,724
Okay, new priority.
Walter's got Luke.

666
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,091
<i>He knows he's been working
for the cops,</i>

667
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,327
so we need to find him,
and find him fast.

668
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:05,929
Let me see what I can get.

669
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:07,164
Where's Walter?

670
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:09,967
This is time sensitive!
Where is he?

671
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:11,402
Save your breath,
it's not gonna happen.

672
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,870
<i>Hey, we can
protect you from him.</i>

673
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,004
Ed.

674
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,305
Getting nowhere
with the targets either.

675
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Just saved their lives,

676
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:18,708
and they're still not talking.

677
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:20,209
Okay, okay.
Boss, you getting that?

678
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:22,044
<i>We got a whole lot
of nothing here.</i>

679
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,179
Anything?

680
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:24,514
No.

681
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:27,384
Okay, spike, let's run down
brigadier properties,

682
00:30:27,418 --> 00:30:30,452
known hideouts,
business affiliations.

683
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:31,553
On it!

684
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:33,955
Out!

685
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:36,725
No, I don't need you. Out.

686
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:45,567
You don't remember me, do you?

687
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:48,235
The Andrews kid.
You're his mom.

688
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,737
You stormed into my shop
that day.

689
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:51,672
<i>That's right.</i>

690
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:53,408
You should have told me
you were a cop.

691
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:54,675
I was there as a mother.

692
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,343
Oh, so you're the one
who turned Luke?

693
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:57,445
Oof!

694
00:31:00,716 --> 00:31:02,049
I'll take that as a yes.

695
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:05,786
She inside?

696
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,527
<i>*** you know, Luke
could be dead.</i>

697
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:14,895
Are you good with that?

698
00:31:15,863 --> 00:31:17,497
He'd be safe
if he'd stayed in line.

699
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,071
I need you to
open this door right now!

700
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:26,406
A couple more of those, detective...

701
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:30,476
And I'll open right up.

702
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,412
Tell me where Luke is!

703
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:38,150
Spike, the internal
command truck camera...

704
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:39,651
<i>can you patch it to me?</i>

705
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:40,885
On it, boss.

706
00:31:40,886 --> 00:31:42,387
Kate?!

707
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:43,721
<i>Don't do this!</i>

708
00:31:43,756 --> 00:31:44,789
You're too close to this thing.

709
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:46,691
<i>You're not seeing this right.</i>

710
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:48,716
Now I need you
to open the door.

711
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,596
Boss, visual's up.

712
00:31:56,602 --> 00:31:57,936
No, Kate!

713
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:05,543
Tell me where Luke is,
or I will end you.

714
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:11,314
Kate, you harm him,

715
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:14,852
<i>we're no closer
to finding Luke!</i>

716
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:16,653
Come on, lady,
listen to your boss out there.

717
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:18,389
I don't have a boss, Brian.

718
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,988
In case you haven't noticed
I just love to force.

719
00:32:21,325 --> 00:32:23,493
<i>Boss, I got that
information you asked for.</i>

720
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,727
Fast, Winnie.

721
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:25,862
I spoke to an officer
who was on the scene

722
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:27,463
the night
of Evan Andrew's death.

723
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:28,598
<i>Luke Mathers was there.</i>

724
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:29,632
Okay...

725
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,635
He was the one
driving the boat.

726
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:35,972
Look, I have a
family, all right?

727
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:37,339
It was a freak accident.

728
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:38,841
A piling had broken free
and drifted out into the lake,

729
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,308
<i>but alcohol was a factor.</i>

730
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,076
If I cross Walter,

731
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:43,111
<i>then no one's left untouched,</i>

732
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:45,279
and you know that!

733
00:32:45,314 --> 00:32:46,481
When help arrived,

734
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,416
<i>they found Luke
near the overturned boat.</i>

735
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,718
He was half-drowned,
hypothermic,

736
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:51,520
<i>diving down over and over.</i>

737
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,488
Trying to find Evan,
trying to save him.

738
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:57,090
Don't you dare
talk to me about family!

739
00:32:57,158 --> 00:32:58,792
I have a kid!

740
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,429
They had to forcibly
pull Luke out of the water.

741
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:04,231
He's blaming himself...

742
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:05,365
<i>And maybe now Luke's
trying to make amends.</i>

743
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,433
Yeah.

744
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,201
Thanks, Winnie.

745
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:11,104
<i>Kate, I'm coming in!</i>

746
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,074
<i>Kate!</i>

747
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:20,413
Kate...

748
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:37,778
<i>We still need
answers; Give him some air.</i>

749
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:45,418
Okay, the Brigadiers have
ties to two construction companies,

750
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:47,754
some commercial real estate,
a demolition business.

751
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:49,756
Gives them access to properties
all over the city.

752
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,858
Okay, let's start
crossing them off.

753
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:53,626
Winnie, I need every
available unit!

754
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,795
<i>Copy that.</i>

755
00:33:58,031 --> 00:33:59,732
Just lower the gun.

756
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:00,966
<i>Let's talk about
what's happening here.</i>

757
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:02,467
Come on.

758
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:04,403
I have to save Luke.

759
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:06,739
He wanted out,
I pushed him in further.

760
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:08,340
<i>No. No, you didn't.</i>

761
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:09,741
He didn't come to you for help.

762
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:12,543
Yes - to get outta
the Brigadiers, he'd...

763
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:16,980
No. He came to get
you back into his life.

764
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:18,515
What?

765
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:20,784
<i>That night at
the police station</i>

766
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:22,452
<i>wasn't a plea for help.</i>

767
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:24,554
That was a gift - all of it...

768
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:25,789
it was a gift.

769
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:27,390
Joining the Brigadiers,
getting patched in,

770
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:30,828
he did it all for you -
to serve them up.

771
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,129
Now why would he do that?

772
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:34,396
To give you
something that you wanted.

773
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:36,265
To atone...

774
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:37,566
<i>The only way he knew how,</i>

775
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,668
because he blamed himself
for Evan's death,

776
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,671
<i>because he felt guilty
for surviving,</i>

777
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,406
and because he wanted you back.

778
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:45,507
No...

779
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,313
Let's try this again.

780
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:58,954
<i>You need to tell me exactly
what the police know.</i>

781
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:09,329
It's over, Walter.

782
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:10,430
<i>You're done.</i>

783
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:19,940
I pushed him away.

784
00:35:20,908 --> 00:35:22,942
You were grieving, Kate.

785
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:24,177
<i>You were facing a pain</i>

786
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:25,645
that no person
should have to endure.

787
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:27,814
What you did was natural.

788
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:31,350
I let him endanger himself.

789
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:35,789
Hey, and now we're gonna
find him, all right?

790
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:39,658
<i>Do you wanna do right by Luke?</i>

791
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,294
Then you'll be there
when we do.

792
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:45,497
Give me the gun. Come on.

793
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:51,069
<i>Come on.</i>

794
00:35:53,606 --> 00:35:55,239
Let's go find Luke.

795
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,477
Thank you, Kate.

796
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:02,747
Thank you.

797
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:10,821
You see that cruiser, Brian?

798
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:12,055
Yeah.

799
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,457
We're gonna walk to it,

800
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,025
which means you've got
30 seconds to change your mind.

801
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,360
Or what? You gonna
wave a bigger gun in my face?

802
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:17,561
Just be quiet, Brian.

803
00:36:17,595 --> 00:36:19,530
This is a listening walk
for you.

804
00:36:19,564 --> 00:36:20,864
Richard Breed is alive.

805
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:23,133
So is Karl Borance
and Dennis Barber.

806
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,468
Your coup failed.

807
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:25,868
I don't know
what you're talking about.

808
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,503
You backed the wrong guy,
Brian.

809
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:29,004
Walter's going down,
I promise you that.

810
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:30,973
We will get him,
and when we do...

811
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:32,542
Where does that leave you?

812
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,310
That's a hell
of an enemies list:

813
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:37,447
Brigadiers, Devil's Guard,
and us - the cops.

814
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:38,681
Now, if I were you,
I'd think real hard

815
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:40,316
about which one of these groups
is least likely

816
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:42,116
to kill your family
in the night,

817
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:46,588
and then I might try
to ally myself with them.

818
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,857
Walk's over. Get in.

819
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:51,493
Wait...

820
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,831
You'll protect my family?

821
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:57,098
We will.

822
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,801
- The Matador Ballroom.
- Eddie, Batador Ballroom.

823
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:08,676
<i>Spike?</i>

824
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:10,143
Got it.
The old Windemere hotel...

825
00:37:10,178 --> 00:37:11,912
one of the brigadier's
demolition contracts.

826
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,847
<i>4108 Dovercourt.</i>

827
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:15,047
We're close.

828
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:16,649
Winnie, have all
units fall back,

829
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:18,150
wait for the SRU to approach.

830
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:19,452
<i>Copy that.</i>

831
00:37:30,196 --> 00:37:32,264
<i>Based on the floor
plan, three points of entry.</i>

832
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:34,332
Spike, Sam, take the west
wall; Leah, take the east;

833
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:36,802
Jules and I'll take the South.

834
00:37:45,077 --> 00:37:46,143
Good to go.

835
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,791
All right, enough.

836
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,759
We're done.

837
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:04,594
Two armed subjects,
threat level red.

838
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:05,995
<i>Breach on my go.</i>

839
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,263
Three...

840
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:07,997
It didn't have
to go like this, Luke.

841
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:08,965
Two...

842
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:09,966
Do it.

843
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:10,934
One.

844
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:12,335
Go!

845
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:13,770
Right there! Put the guns down!

846
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:17,340
Police! Drop your weapon!
On the ground! Do it now!

847
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:18,741
Get on the ground now!

848
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:20,208
Drop your weapon now!

849
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:21,710
Drop it!

850
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,946
Now! Down on the ground!
Down on the ground! Get down!

851
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,213
All right!

852
00:38:25,248 --> 00:38:26,682
Gimme your arm, put
it behind your back.

853
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:29,552
Behind your back!

854
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:30,686
Subjects secure.

855
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,988
We have Walter McHale
in custody.

856
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:36,123

864
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:26,138
Got 'em.

865
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:27,672
Okay.

866
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,608
Luke, I need you to know...

867
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:31,977
I never blamed you
for Evan dying.

868
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:33,012
Mrs. A, I was the one driving...

869
00:39:33,046 --> 00:39:35,147
no, no, no, listen to me,
please.

870
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:36,615
Luke, I pushed you away.

871
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:39,217
- I am so sorry.
- You're sorry?

872
00:39:39,284 --> 00:39:43,321
I was in pain,
and I was confused,

873
00:39:43,355 --> 00:39:46,124
and I turned my back on you...

874
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:49,227
Luke, you've got nothing
to make up for.

875
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:54,031
We both lost someone
that night,

876
00:39:54,098 --> 00:39:57,600
and now I know
what you've always known...

877
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:01,371
The only way through this
is together.

878
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:06,209

Oh yeah, will do.

884
00:40:37,073 --> 00:40:40,141
<i>'Kay, bye.</i>

885
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,245
So a 14-year-old kid's
walking home through the park

886
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,814
when he gets jumped
by four older guys.

887
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:49,316
Do you know how
this story ends?

888
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,784
I have some idea.

889
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:52,453
With a good samaritan
stepping in

890
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:55,189
to fight off the attackers.

891
00:40:55,223 --> 00:40:56,457
Who told you that?

892
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:57,924
Kid's mom.

893
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:00,359
She called you a hero.

894
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:04,530
Is he all right, that kid?

895
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:06,466
Yeah - a couple broken ribs,

896
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,667
but he'll be fine.

897
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:10,303
How does that feel -
being called a hero?

898
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:17,943
Okay, I gotta ask you, Dean.

899
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,578
Why?

900
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:21,213
Why step in?

901
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:22,982
<i>This kid's a stranger.
Those guys might've had knives.</i>

902
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:24,650
Why take the chance?

903
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:26,819
You need me
to explain that to you?

904
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:27,953
I do.

905
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:33,758
I dunno, I guess it was...

906
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:38,096
Something I saw
in the kid's eyes.

907
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,031
Kid on the ground?

908
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:42,734
No. One of the guys
doing the kicking.

909
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:47,470
I could tell he was...
Confused or...

910
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,605
Afraid.

911
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:50,941
Like it was all just happening

912
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,644
and he was caught up in it.

913
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:57,313
Anyway, I just...
Kinda felt bad for him.

914
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,883
Does that make sense?

915
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,218
Yeah, it makes sense.

916
00:42:13,396 --> 00:42:15,264
Hey...

917
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:17,399
You know, that's gonna
look worse tomorrow, right?

918
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:19,534
That's what they say.

919
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:20,635
Yeah.
