1
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:19,179
Stop!

2
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:21,612
You're supposed to stop
for people who need help.

3
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:26,352
Uh-uh, not so fast, Barry Allen.
Forget about them.

4
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:29,149
You can't change other people.
Just a waste of energy.

5
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:30,757
- But…
- Barry…

6
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:33,622
When I was a little girl,
Grandma taught me a prayer:

7
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,991
Accept the things you cannot change.

8
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:38,394
Have the courage
to change the things you can,

9
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:41,399
and have the wisdom
to know the difference.

10
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,462
I don't totally get that.

11
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:47,335
Heh, you will.

12
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,635
Now, all we need is a phone.

13
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,279
There's a gas station.

14
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,976
- Race you.
- Barry!

15
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:38,219
Mom.

16
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,709
And we may never know
exactly what happened...

17
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,853
A break-in gone wrong,
a disturbed mind.

18
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:09,252
But we do know that this was a crime
and a tragedy.

19
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:13,485
And as we commit Nora
to the care of our Lord,

20
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,429
we know her son, Barry, will need
all our prayers and help to see him

21
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,431
<i>through this terrible loss.</i>

22
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:27,937
Happy birthday, Mom.
I'm so sorry.

23
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:30,408
- I should've been there.
- What?

24
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,447
If I just ran a little faster,
I'd have been there.

25
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:37,744
Barry, you were just a boy.
There was nothing you could've done.

26
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,114
We don't know that.

27
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:42,018
If I'd been there,
maybe I could’ve stopped it.

28
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,379
I could’ve saved her.

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,222
Come on, stop doing this to yourself.

30
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,123
What was that saying your mother had?

31
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:49,958
About accepting the things
you can't change?

32
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,603
Well, this is something I can change.

33
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,676
A break-in at the Flash Museum.

34
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,677
- See you later?
- You better.

35
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:33,301
Well, Flash.

36
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,912
Once again, it looks like you're the bottom
and I'm the Top.

37
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,120
Mirror Master and Heat Wave.

38
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,123
Going to a lot of trouble
to steal my old junk, aren't you?

39
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,113
Exhibit's closed, Top.

40
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,956
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

41
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,820
Captains Boomerang and Cold.

42
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,193
The gang's all here.

43
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:09,861
And I thought you forgot about us
as soon as you sent us off to prison.

44
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,267
So this little reunion is about revenge?

45
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:15,672
Not really.
Offing you is just a bonus part of the job.

46
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:17,573
Job? Who hired you?

47
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,181
No offense, heh, none of you clowns
are smart enough to pull this off.

48
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,579
You're quite right, of course, Flash.

49
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:28,289
I knew using these morons
would put you off your guard.

50
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:31,289
- Hey.
- They're motivated by greed.

51
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:34,793
They lack the commitment,
the absolute focus...

52
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:37,124
- To kill me.
- Erase you.

53
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:40,427
I'm gonna bring this shrine to your ego
down on your head.

54
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,470
Along with 10 square blocks
of Central City and everyone around.

55
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:48,074
What? What are you talking about?
We didn't bring any bombs.

56
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,973
Oh, but I did.

57
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:57,184
- What is this?
- Something I attached to your belts

58
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,785
as I made my entrance.

59
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:03,454
I wouldn't unbuckle if I were you.
You'll just set them off.

60
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,887
It's me you want, Thawne.

61
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,961
You don't have to kill
thousands of innocents to bring me down.

62
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,689
No. No, I don't.

63
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:16,236
But I choose to, knowing it will
make your last moments pure agony.

64
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:17,593
Good bye.

65
00:06:21,731 --> 00:06:23,369
You can't escape, Flash.

66
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,913
The adhesive will never completely liquefy,
regardless of speed.

67
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,176
I'm counting on that. Unh.

68
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,486
Now you got no choice, Thawne.

69
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,319
Disarm the bombs
or you blow up with us.

70
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:40,816
Very well.

71
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,487
If it means shattering
your golden throne in history,

72
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,998
linking your name forever
to this city's darkest hour,

73
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,694
then my life is a small price to pay.

74
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,196
I agree.

75
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,507
Your lives aren't worth much.

76
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,214
But Flash's life is.

77
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:15,058
- You called them.
- You've got your posse, I've got mine.

78
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,630
Clearly, you should never do this stuff
without me.

79
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,630
You end up with crap all over yourself.

80
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,471
Focus, GL. Bombs. Batman?

81
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:26,038
It's future tech.

82
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,075
Difficult to disarm without
setting them off, even for me.

83
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:30,836
I could try to vaporize the bombs.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,947
Yes, but you'd be vaporizing
the Rogues as well.

85
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:37,016
Diana's right. What's plan B?

86
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,256
How do we shut off these charges?

87
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,419
You can't. We'll all be dead, shortly.

88
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,689
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

89
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:50,092
We're out of options.

90
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:53,530
Each of you take one of the Rogues
as far from Central City as you can.

91
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,762
We'll attempt to disarm the devices
once sufficiently isolated.

92
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,338
I'm not going to just leave you here.

93
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:03,375
Lantern, we're running out of time.

94
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,877
Hal, go.

95
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:34,267
- I'd suck it in if I were you.
- Uh?

96
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:44,351
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- I am.

97
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,818
I've got a million microbes
eating the bomb's wiring.

98
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,763
Waiting is the worst part.

99
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,519
You may have minimized
the destruction,

100
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:30,749
but the final bomb will still turn
this monument to your ego

101
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,483
into your own tomb.

102
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,797
What are you doing?
You can't escape.

103
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,901
You can't reach the bomb to disarm it.
You're going to die.

104
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,061
You may have my powers, Thawne,

105
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:49,404
but you have almost zero imagination
about using them.

106
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:59,042
Lacks like 25th-century technology
is pretty delicate.

107
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:13,159
I've notified S.T.A.R. Labs to ready a
cozy little cell for you, Professor.

108
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:15,598
I understand the food's not great there,
Zoom.

109
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,898
Enjoy your petty little victories, Flash.

110
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:23,807
But no matter how fast you run,
you can't save everyone.

111
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,572
Not the ones that matter to you.

112
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:32,549
Best to keep your mouth shut
if you don't want bugs in your teeth.

113
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,649
Thawne's a classic sociopath.

114
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:40,818
They have a knack for knowing
just what will get under your skin.

115
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:43,520
Yeah. They do.

116
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:46,133
You okay?

117
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:49,530
Don't worry about me, Bats. I'm fine.

118
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:51,968
Nothing I can't run off.

119
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,029
Sync & corrections: Reef
addic7ed.com

120
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:16,230
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

121
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:22,525
I don't mean to interrupt your beauty
sleep, Lord knows you need it,

122
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:25,639
but the Elongated Kid murderer
isn't gonna catch himself.

123
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:29,333
- Elongated Man was murdered?
- Elongated <i>Kid.</i>

124
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,539
What?

125
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:36,343
Director Singh wants us pulling
all-nighters until we close this case.

126
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,706
Hey, what's going on?

127
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:40,119
<i>We interrupt our programming
to bring breaking news.</i>

128
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,914
We're live outside the Cold Museum.

129
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,058
<i>Citizen Cold
is battling Captain Boomerang.</i>

130
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:47,683
<i>Reportedly, the confrontation began
inside the museum moments ago.</i>

131
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,386
Cold is on the loose already?

132
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:51,998
Do we really have to learn
this stuff on TV?

133
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:54,192
Doesn't anyone call the cops anymore?

134
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,268
Looks like a power struggle
in the Rogues.

135
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,405
- Who are the Rogues?
- The Rogues.

136
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,767
Flash's worst enemies…?

137
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:03,843
Bent on Flash's destruction,
so they can take over Central City?

138
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,072
Okay, we'll continue
this hilarious leg-pulling later.

139
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:10,012
After the Flash has taken care
of Citizen Cold.

140
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:21,092
Barry, are you all right?

141
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:23,718
<i>Mom?</i>

142
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,234
Mom.

143
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:35,499
Oh, that was a nasty spill,
even for you.

144
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:37,076
Let me see your head.

145
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,511
I'm fine. Mom.

146
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:45,548
It's you. You're here.

147
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,551
Heh, well, of course I'm here.

148
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,350
You promised me
you'd take me to dinner on my birthday.

149
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:54,427
It's my birthday.
The end of the world can't stop that.

150
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,632
You forgot. Heh, it's okay, Barry.

151
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,635
It's easy for a busy young man
to forget his old mom.

152
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,637
I could never forget you.

153
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:16,079
Oh, heh. Oh, my.

154
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,312
Barry, what's gotten into you?
Are you all right?

155
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:24,549
People have been acting so strangely with
this terrible war hanging over their heads.

156
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:27,593
War? What? No, Mom, I'm fine.

157
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,357
But everything else has changed,
and I have to find out why.

158
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,659
It probably has something
to do with me being...

159
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:36,133
- Gay?
- What? No.

160
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,670
It's okay. I lave you no matter what.

161
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:43,504
Mom, it's not that. It's something else.

162
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,477
Brace yourself for a shock.

163
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,246
- I'm the Flash.
- Oh.

164
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,514
What's the Flash?

165
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:58,750
You know, the Flash.
Fastest man alive?

166
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:01,623
Fights crime?
Very famous superhero?

167
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:06,426
A superhero?
Heh, you mean like Batman?

168
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,943
Where's the Joker? Unh.

169
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:29,839
Where, Yo-Yo?

170
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:33,052
Tell me where the Joker's funhouse
is this time.

171
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,779
While you can still talk.

172
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:39,783
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. Ow.

173
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,786
Let me help you get it off.

174
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:48,001
Judge Dent was kidnapped last night.
Where did the Joker take him?

175
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:54,636
Even if I did know,
it wouldn't do you any good, Bats.

176
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:57,801
- He's probably already dead.
- Then so are you.

177
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:12,456
Cyborg? I surrender.

178
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,322
To you.

179
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:15,826
Smart.

180
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,564
- Batman.
- You should have let her hit the pavement.

181
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,330
- You shouldn't have thrown her.
- She slipped.

182
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:27,201
- Aren't you wondering how I found you?
- Thermal vision.

183
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,563
Cybernetic hearing.

184
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:31,610
And total access to every camera
on the grid.

185
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:35,078
Must be a nice perk for being
in the president's back pocket.

186
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,046
I've told you it's not like that.

187
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:39,686
As national security adviser,
I can help more people.

188
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:42,083
Like that murdering psychopath?

189
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,952
Maybe you should go help people
in some other town.

190
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,889
We're trying to help all the people,

191
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,427
while there's still a world left.
We need you.

192
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,394
We...?

193
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:56,131
Hologram party. Ingenious.

194
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,169
Saves a fortune on snacks.

195
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:05,040
Enchantress, Pied Piper, Citizen Cold,
Shade, Sandman, The Shazam Kids.

196
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:09,342
It's Batman. Seriously, Batman.

197
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,180
- He's older than I thought.
- But I'm not hard of hearing.

198
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,386
You know why we're here, Batman.
War.

199
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:20,788
Over 100 million people died

200
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,159
when Atlantis sank
Western Europe into the ocean.

201
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,459
Another 32 million slaughtered,

202
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,898
when the Amazons
invaded the United Kingdom

203
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:30,901
and renamed it New Themyscira.

204
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,267
We have to take down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman

205
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:36,569
before their war destroys
what's left of the world.

206
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:41,346
- We can do it.
- That's exactly what Captain Atom said,

207
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:43,814
before he flew over there and vanished.

208
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:47,443
He went in without a plan or backup.
That's where you come in.

209
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,148
If we want to win this thing, we need
the best tactician on the planet.

210
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,259
You.

211
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,897
You can't just turn your back on this.

212
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,124
Not when we've got a chance to stop
this war and save the world.

213
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:04,362
War's over, soldier.
You just don't know it yet.

214
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,404
Everybody lost.

215
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:23,248
- Can I help you, sir?
- Sir? Doris, it's me.

216
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,657
No, I don't need help.
Everything's fine now.

217
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,664
<i>Mommy.</i>

218
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,097
- How is my little angel?
- Awesome.

219
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,437
Daddy took me out to lunch
and we had chicken wings,

220
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,447
and I told him about the invasion drill
we had at school today.

221
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,479
Bruce? Alfred?

222
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:42,569
What happened to you, Bruce?

223
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:46,263
You were the James Bond
of superheroes.

224
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:48,600
What turned you into the Unabomber?

225
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,780
Who are you?

226
00:20:55,938 --> 00:21:01,115
I said who the hell are you?

227
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,887
Bruce, wait. You have to remember.
It's me. It's Barry.

228
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:09,120
Barry Allen. Bruce?

229
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:10,730
- Bruce?
- Bruce.

230
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:13,696
Bruce is dead. I watched him die.

231
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,460
My God.

232
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:18,503
He's the one who died
that night in the alley.

233
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:23,132
Bruce died and you lived.
You're his father.

234
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,674
You're Thomas Wayne.

235
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,377
Pilgrim to Mayflower, do you copy?

236
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:37,252
Where the hell are you?
I'm at the rendezvous point.

237
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:40,656
There's no sign of the package
or any other members of the resistance.

238
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,727
And I'm up to my neck in Amazons.

239
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,357
You're an American.

240
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:14,153
But you're going to tell me
a little more about yourself.

241
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:17,854
- Who are you?
- No. Ugh.

242
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,727
He's resisting the Lasso of Truth.

243
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:22,198
How is that possible, Queen Diana?

244
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:24,133
It's not.

245
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,205
Who are you, and what are you doing
in New Themyscira?

246
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:36,876
My name is Colonel Steve Trevor
of the United States Special Forces.

247
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,612
- I'm here to retrieve Lois Lane.
- Who is Lois Lane?

248
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,120
Lois Lane is a Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist

249
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,054
who's been embedded
in New Themyscira for three months,

250
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:48,125
gathering intel
on your Amazons for Cyborg.

251
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,629
She's, unh... She's also one of the most
beautiful woman I've ever met.

252
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,987
Until now, you mean.

253
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:55,871
Our information was correct.

254
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:58,029
Cyborg is amassing the outside
world's super-humans,

255
00:22:58,193 --> 00:23:00,139
in an attempt
to interfere with our war.

256
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,141
He will fail.
Now, find me this Lois Lane.

257
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:09,044
Yes, my Queen.
May I deal with the prisoner for you?

258
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:10,404
No.

259
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:13,012
The Queen of the Amazons
is a servant to her people.

260
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,252
Nothing is beneath her.

261
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:36,943
I told you, everything changed.

262
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,136
You have nine more fingers.

263
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:43,146
I suggest you tell me
how you found out about me.

264
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:47,952
In my world,
I'm a hero named the Flash.

265
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,181
Bruce took me here, showed me...

266
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,884
I used to be a doctor.

267
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:59,790
Mention my dead son again and I will
break out my surgical instruments.

268
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:11,802
My ring. Let me show you
that I'm telling the truth.

269
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,311
My uniform is in that ring.

270
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,308
I'll humor you.

271
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:28,053
See? I told…

272
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,110
Not what you were expecting?

273
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:36,732
- No. Thawne.
- Who?

274
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,838
The man this uniform belongs to.

275
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:42,441
My opposite, the Reverse-Flash.
Eobard Thawne.

276
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:46,102
- What kind of name is <i>Eobard?</i>
- The 25th-century kind.

277
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:49,738
He replicated the accident that allowed me
to tap into the Speed Force,

278
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,010
became a criminal,
Professor Zoom.

279
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:53,374
"Speed Force?"

280
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:58,151
The Speed Force allows both of us to bend
the laws of physics using super speed.

281
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:00,350
He can travel through time.

282
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:04,524
You're suggesting that he changed
something in the past...

283
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:07,360
That changed everything. It's crazy.

284
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:10,265
My mom's alive. You're Batman.

285
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:14,271
And Diana and Arthur
are about to start World War Ill.

286
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,767
But why give me this?

287
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:21,276
He hates you.

288
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,042
So much he'll destroy everything
to kill you.

289
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:27,847
But his psychosis requires
that you know he's responsible.

290
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,650
Could anyone, even Thawne,
be that deranged?

291
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,391
You'd be amazed the monsters
this world can create.

292
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:40,733
We have to stop this, Dr. Wayne.

293
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:42,766
Catch Thawne,
find out what he changed,

294
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:45,496
and change it back before Aquaman
and Wonder Woman

295
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:47,538
kill everyone on the planet.

296
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:51,667
Not saying I believe you,
but in your reality...

297
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:54,814
- Is my son...?
- Bruce is alive.

298
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,916
He's Batman.

299
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,285
If I were to help you,
what exactly would we need?

300
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:06,153
Just what's over there
and unbelievably bad weather.

301
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:10,594
Welcome to Gotham.

302
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,358
I thought you were supposed to be smart.

303
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:24,810
I am smart, captain. Very smart.

304
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,607
Unfortunately,
having the greatest intellect on Earth

305
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,010
doesn't always help one
do the impossible.

306
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,709
You better be able to pinpoint
that son of a bitch.

307
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:35,616
Aquaman's doomsday device
should be easy for me to find,

308
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,848
simply by locating the power source.

309
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,391
A weapon capable
of wiping out continents

310
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:42,995
would require an astonishing
amount of energy.

311
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:44,994
Based on my analysis
of the shockwave,

312
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:47,793
our course should take us
right over the origin point.

313
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:50,368
And there's nothing. Not a blip.

314
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,028
I'm taking a big risk
coming this close to his waters.

315
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,335
- How close are we?
- See for yourself.

316
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,748
That's a lot of death.

317
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,109
Even for me.

318
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:12,487
I suggest if you want to prevent further
tragedies of this magnitude...

319
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:37,878
Battle stations!

320
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:40,282
A bit too late for that, I think.

321
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,030
Surface-dwellers, my lord.
Not Amazons.

322
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,403
Meddlers, Orm. They're in my way.

323
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:50,705
Well, at least I know I was right.

324
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:54,348
No survivors.

325
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:02,159
This is crazy. You ought to be in Arkham.

326
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:05,821
Maybe so, but I need to recreate
the conditions of the accident

327
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,490
that turned me into the Flash.
Strap me in.

328
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:19,107
You know, they say that lightning
doesn't strike the same place twice.

329
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:21,247
"They say" a lot of things.

330
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,508
Now why don't we pull the switch
and find out?

331
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,321
Come on.

332
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:53,311
Come on, I'm here.

333
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,811
I'm right here!

334
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,136
Oh, my God.

335
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:42,956
<i>I wish you had better news for me, Cyborg.</i>

336
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:47,589
<i>This cloud of war grows ever darker,
and I fear we've run out of options.</i>

337
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:52,865
l just need a little more time,
Mr. President.

338
00:31:53,028 --> 00:31:57,272
<i>Victor, there is no more time.
Lex Luthor is dead.</i>

339
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,775
<i>His mission failed.</i>

340
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:02,347
<i>But at least we know the estimated
location of Aquaman's WMD.</i>

341
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,383
Sir, let my team take
out the Atlantean device.

342
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,046
<i>Cyborg, you did your best recruiting
meta-humans to help us end this conﬂict,</i>

343
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:14,455
<i>but our top analysts say without
the Batman, you have no team.</i>

344
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,892
<i>It's time to send in
the real heroes, son.</i>

345
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:18,360
The military?

346
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,899
The Atlantean tech will see them coming
from half a world away.

347
00:32:22,057 --> 00:32:23,730
<i>Let our boys worry about that.</i>

348
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:26,771
<i>Thank you for everything
you've done for this country, Victor.</i>

349
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:30,637
<i>But as of now, you're relieved of duty.</i>

350
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,193
<i>War, war, war!</i>

351
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:44,971
No…

352
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,417
No!

353
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,262
Lie down.
You have third-degree burns.

354
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:47,627
You're lucky to be alive.

355
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:55,374
Somehow I remember things
from this timeline.

356
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:58,416
How Aquaman destroyed
most of Europe.

357
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,712
Maybe that lightning jagged
your memory.

358
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:03,321
But I can remember my world as well.

359
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:07,016
A world where Aquaman would die
before harming innocent people.

360
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:12,928
My memories are changing, realigning
with this new history Thawne's created.

361
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,966
Soon I'll forget my timeline
and everyone in it.

362
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:18,934
My wife, your son.

363
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,734
- We're getting that world back.
- Huh. How?

364
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,906
We try again.

365
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:32,144
Try again.

366
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:34,810
But, sire, the device is too dangerous.

367
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:38,446
Our attack on New Themyscira
destroyed an entire continent,

368
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,389
but still left the Amazon's
new homeland untouched.

369
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:47,625
More unholy magic from those witches.
Next time we will level their island.

370
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:52,400
Please, my Emperor.

371
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,733
We tried to use only a fraction
of the power,

372
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:56,739
and now it is even less stable.

373
00:36:56,898 --> 00:37:00,277
I fear we could sweep clean the ocean floor
as well as the surface world.

374
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,635
I see.

375
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:03,977
Then we will take the witches' island
by force.

376
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,516
Inch by bloody inch, if necessary.

377
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,314
They will pay
for what they did to Queen Mera.

378
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:15,387
I told you never to speak her name.

379
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,257
Yes, my liege.

380
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:19,762
Prepare the armadas
for surface invasion.

381
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,595
The Amazons' judgment is at hand.

382
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:38,813
Because of you, I'll be responsible
for the deaths of millions.

383
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:55,347
The odds against recreating exact
variables in the original accident are...

384
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,963
Then just try to douse the flames
a little faster this time, okay?

385
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:53,954
Told you I was fast.

386
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,762
This is Lois Lane of <i> The Daily Planet</i>.

387
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,996
My battery is about to die
and l will likely be joining it soon.

388
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:25,149
Earlier today the Amazons captured
some of Aquaman's advance scouts.

389
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:29,921
Wonder Woman's lasso made them
spill their guts, literally.

390
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:50,839
Aquaman is leading his army through
the English Channel tomorrow.

391
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:53,781
The Amazons are worried
that if he gets his secret weapon

392
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,285
past their shield,
they'll be vulnerable.

393
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:58,126
They remain defiant in the face of...

394
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:15,066
If there is an afterlife...

395
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,709
A cushy anchor job
would not be out of line.

396
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:37,386
Amazons, be ready for...

397
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:46,001
Who are you? What are you?

398
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:53,241
Don't worry, hot legs.
We're on your side.

399
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,909
Yes, fear not, good lady.

400
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,914
Though our appearance
is somewhat frightful, we're...

401
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,484
The Resistance, I know.

402
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:04,179
Grifter, Godiva, Mrs. Hyde,
Canterbury Cricket.

403
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,329
And some kind of demon from hell?

404
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:17,198
To my share of chaos I make my claim
and Etrigan is my name.

405
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,134
Oh, great, he rhymes.
That's not going to get old fast.

406
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:23,832
Heh, Lois Lane's famous mouth.

407
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:26,569
I can't believe you didn't get
an arrow shot through it.

408
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,580
I would have, if it weren't for whichever
one of you can run at super-speed.

409
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,411
So who do I thank?

410
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:36,521
I don't know what you think just happened,
but there ain't no speedster on this team.

411
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:39,157
Now, let's get out of here
while we still can.

412
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,963
Never seen anything like it.

413
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:51,136
Your burns are healing.
You should be dead.

414
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:53,272
Your bedside manner sucks.

415
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,874
If I didn't have the Speed Force
helping me heal, I'd find another doctor.

416
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,006
I run a casino.

417
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,237
Haven't been a doctor in 20 years.

418
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:05,441
Here. You need a suit,
and I'm not about to loan you one of mine.

419
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,450
What? It's friction-proof, isn't it?

420
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:19,991
I had to at least make some
last-minute alterations.

421
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:22,657
Very snazzy.
I suggest you take it for a test run,

422
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:25,099
and make sure you can break
that time barrier.

423
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:26,761
Once we know that...

424
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,510
So I'm finally on the other end
of that trick.

425
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:55,300
Come on, Barry. Faster.

426
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,903
Faster.

427
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:26,955
If you would just slip these
over your shoes, Mr. Jordan.

428
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:29,795
Sure. Cleaning bill here must be murder.

429
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:31,493
What's your name?

430
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:35,334
I'm afraid we don't have time
for introductions, Captain Jordan.

431
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:39,444
- Pity.
- I was warned about you.

432
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,638
But the president wanted the best pilot,
so you're stuck with me.

433
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:45,349
Why don't you show me
what you've got hidden away here,

434
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:47,476
and I'll show you what
I can do with it?

435
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,815
Holy crap…

436
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:53,856
I was hoping this would shut you up.

437
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:56,757
Crashed in the California Desert
eight years ago.

438
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,830
Our scientists have been
piecing it back together since then.

439
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:05,733
Its handling capabilities are,
well, beyond anything that we have.

440
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,102
May be a little tricky to get the hang of.

441
00:44:11,265 --> 00:44:13,609
Ooh, and who's this handsome devil?

442
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,270
- Pilot.
- Died on impact?

443
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:17,313
Kicked off just as my men found him.

444
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:19,542
Report said he muttered
something in English:

445
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:21,482
"Beware my power."

446
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:25,749
Then a glowing ring floated off his finger
and shot into space.

447
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,722
His ring flew away?

448
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:30,328
You're about to fly
a dead alien's spaceship,

449
00:44:30,484 --> 00:44:32,987
and that's the part
you have trouble believing?

450
00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:34,354
Touché.

451
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:38,359
You understand, Jordan,
this mission is no cake walk. In fact...

452
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:40,733
In fact, in all likelihood,
it's a one-way trip.

453
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:44,741
And if I'm afraid, if I want to back out,
no hard feelings, something like that?

454
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:46,537
Something like that.

455
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:49,614
General Lane, all my life,
I felt like something

456
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,046
really special was waiting for me.

457
00:44:52,206 --> 00:44:54,049
Something nobody else
on earth could do.

458
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:58,714
I think l just found it.
So the last thing I am is afraid.

459
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:04,328
This thing is unbelievably slow,
just like me.

460
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:06,362
You move pretty fast to my eyes.

461
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,933
Not fast enough to break the time barrier,
which I need to do.

462
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:14,233
The only thing I can figure is that another
speedster is co-opting the Speed Force,

463
00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:17,171
keeping me from accessing
enough energy to time-travel.

464
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:22,178
But there is no other speedster.
Not in the real world. My world.

465
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:23,940
So it has to be Zoom.

466
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:26,210
He's the only one
who could’ve done this.

467
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:29,149
He's deliberately preventing me
from changing things back.

468
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,812
Then nothing can be done.

469
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,687
Even if we knew the trigger point, there's
no one to go back in time and fix it.

470
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:36,795
Superman could.

471
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:41,331
I already told you, there's no meta-human
that fits that description in this reality.

472
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,968
I'm not so sure.

473
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:47,630
In my new memories of this timeline,
I saw something.

474
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:51,265
- A meteor. It hit a city.
- Metropolis.

475
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:52,632
Thirty years ago.

476
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:57,113
The same day Superman's rocket
crashed in my reality.

477
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,448
So this never happened in your world?

478
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,024
- It must be a paradise.
- It's not.

479
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,489
But at least there was hope.

480
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:11,129
What makes you think
your space baby survived?

481
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:12,485
He's a tough cookie.

482
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:16,159
- Where's your contact?
- Don't worry. He's always on time.

483
00:46:20,394 --> 00:46:22,465
I have to admit, I didn't expect your call.

484
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,830
Cyborg?

485
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:30,047
- Vic? You look different.
- Have we met?

486
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,912
No, he's new. Super-speed.
Goes by the Flash.

487
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:35,349
You still need a strategist
for your little army?

488
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:37,045
Someone to put together a team

489
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,350
to shut down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman?

490
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:42,392
- I... Yes.
- I'll do it.

491
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,430
But my way, and I pick the team.
Starting with the Flash.

492
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:49,761
Then we want to find the alien
who crash-landed here in Metropolis.

493
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:51,835
Alien? What are you talking about?

494
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:53,192
The meteor.

495
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:56,035
It's not what your pals
at the Pentagon said it was.

496
00:46:57,698 --> 00:47:01,373
Classified information.
We need it and you can get it.

497
00:47:08,943 --> 00:47:11,389
Why aren't you telling him
about me and the timeline?

498
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:14,458
- I'm not lying.
- You're misleading him.

499
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:16,959
He has a right to know
what our real plan is.

500
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:19,825
Don't preach to me.
I got enough misplaced morality

501
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:22,900
to handle with the big metal
Boy Scout on our hands.

502
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:25,401
He wants to stop the war.
So do we.

503
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:26,867
That's all he needs to know.

504
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,807
There's something there,
but it's above even my clearance.

505
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:35,270
I don't hack into government systems,
Batman.

506
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:36,744
You do now.

507
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:39,248
If you want me
on your little suicide squad.

508
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:09,748
I'm cycling the motion sensors
and security cameras,

509
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:11,906
but the loop won't go unnoticed
for long.

510
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:13,779
Early morning skeleton crew.

511
00:48:13,941 --> 00:48:16,046
Well, do your thing.

512
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:36,668
I'm trusting
that this is <i>absolutely</i> necessary.

513
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,276
That's why we're here.

514
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:42,413
Listen, I don't know
what changed your mind or why,

515
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:46,381
but with you on board,
we can save the world from this war.

516
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,746
Thank you.

517
00:48:47,908 --> 00:48:49,819
Focus on the mission at hand, Stone.

518
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:50,069
Sir, are you okay?

519
00:49:53,107 --> 00:49:54,484
Is that Clark?

520
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:56,882
This is the most powerful being
on the planet?

521
00:49:57,044 --> 00:49:59,251
Help me.

522
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:03,259
Whoa, easy there, friend.
Everything's going to be fine now.

523
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,626
- Friend?
- That's right.

524
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:10,394
Cyborg here is your friend.
I'm your friend too.

525
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:20,372
This must be some kind of mistake.

526
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:23,606
- A rogue division of the government…
- Keep telling yourself that.

527
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,615
We should have left him where he was.
He'd be safer.

528
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,720
He needs the sun.

529
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:32,255
Don't know if you can understand me,
but what happened to you was wrong.

530
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:34,757
- Most humans aren't like them.
- They're worse.

531
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:36,690
No. People are good.

532
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,797
In fact, some of them risk their lives
for the greater good.

533
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,832
- They're called heroes.
- Heroes?

534
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:46,062
Don't worry, friend.
Everything is going to be okay.

535
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:47,796
I thought heroes never lied.

536
00:50:54,902 --> 00:50:58,543
Cyborg, stand down!
You have exceeded your authority.

537
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:02,016
Return the stolen government property
or face immediate fire.

538
00:51:02,176 --> 00:51:05,646
You don't understand.
They were using this man as a lab rat.

539
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,656
I don't think they care, Vic.

540
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:12,795
So beautiful.

541
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:16,458
I have orders from the president
of the United States.

542
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,594
- Maybe I can end this peacefully.
- Yeah, maybe.

543
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:23,636
No!

544
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,510
Friends.

545
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,001
Superman, close your eyes!

546
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:02,743
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a seizure.

547
00:53:02,863 --> 00:53:06,140
Memories collapsing in on each other.
We gotta get him out of here.

548
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,442
Fight it, Allen. Don't forget my son.

549
00:53:15,576 --> 00:53:16,776
Hell, yeah!

550
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:18,788
<i>Highball, this is Papa Bear.</i>

551
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,265
<i>- Cut the chatter.</i>
- Oh, did I say that out loud?

552
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,581
I didn't know.

553
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,571
<i>You're only 1000 miles from drop zone.</i>

554
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:26,792
<i>- Commence radio silence.</i>
- Happily.

555
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,454
<i>One last thing, Jordan.
On behalf of all humanity…</i>

556
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:33,179
Oh, shut your hole already.
You're ruining this for me.

557
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:38,740
There you are, baby.
Hold still for Highball.

558
00:53:43,737 --> 00:53:46,775
"Beware my power", asshole.

559
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:09,471
Continue invasion preparations.

560
00:54:14,968 --> 00:54:17,175
- Who the hell is this?
- He's with us.

561
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,045
Now shut up. What's the story?

562
00:54:20,207 --> 00:54:23,313
Some kind of failed kamikaze attack
on Aquaman's weapon.

563
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:27,391
- The pilot was Hal Jordan.
- Hal's dead?

564
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:28,753
That's not all.

565
00:54:28,915 --> 00:54:31,725
The president sent a coalition fleet
to New Themyscira.

566
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:33,592
The Amazons decimated it.

567
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:35,825
Troops are being ordered
to Washington D.C.,

568
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:38,401
to protect the President
and members of Congress.

569
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:41,937
Yeah, as our fearless leaders
make a mad dash for the bunkers.

570
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:43,295
What does it mean?

571
00:54:43,397 --> 00:54:48,574
It means the final battle between Atlantis
and the Amazons has begun.

572
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:50,840
But we haven't even started yet.

573
00:54:51,004 --> 00:54:52,540
There's nothing we can do now.

574
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,312
Enjoy the things you love
with the time we have left.

575
00:54:55,475 --> 00:54:57,819
There's bound to be looting
in Gotham by now.

576
00:54:58,645 --> 00:54:59,988
I don't want to miss that.

577
00:55:00,147 --> 00:55:02,650
You're just gonna give up
and wait for the inevitable?

578
00:55:02,816 --> 00:55:04,659
Is that what your heroes do here?

579
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:07,162
Look, you guys may not know me.

580
00:55:07,321 --> 00:55:10,928
But all of us have powers,
skills and abilities.

581
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:13,731
Where I come from,
heroes use those powers

582
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:17,865
to fight to make the world a better
place, whether it's their world or not.

583
00:55:18,031 --> 00:55:21,444
But Superman...
You said he was our last, best hope.

584
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,741
We're alive, Vic.
And where there's life, there's hope.

585
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,105
We'll go to London,

586
00:55:26,106 --> 00:55:29,053
fight both sides
and save the world in the process.

587
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,221
Okay. Then we go. Now.

588
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,224
I'll signal the others.
Maybe they can meet us there.

589
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,529
Bruce would have come.

590
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,922
What the hell. Let's do this.

591
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:44,468
Is the Batplane big enough
for all of us?

592
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:46,865
The what?

593
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:55,738
Bruce's Batplane was a little more stoic.

594
00:55:55,902 --> 00:55:58,109
Your Batman
didn't have to ferry high rollers

595
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,478
with deep pockets
in and out of his casino.

596
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,416
So he wouldn't need
a fully stocked bar aboard.

597
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:06,285
Everything is top shelf.
Help yourself.

598
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,551
I don't drink.

599
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:11,093
Shocking.

600
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:13,754
I'm glad I could persuade you
to come along.

601
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,120
You didn't.

602
00:56:15,222 --> 00:56:19,602
Ever since I told Cyborg I'd help, I've been
scanning for intel coming out of Europe.

603
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,762
During your little Braveheart speech,

604
00:56:21,928 --> 00:56:25,398
l heard an intercepted message
you may find interesting.

605
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:26,805
What?

606
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:30,058
Lois Lane was an embedded
reporter turned resistance fighter.

607
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,139
She saw something in New Themyscira.

608
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,945
A super being who could move
in the blink of an eye.

609
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:36,308
Thawne.

610
00:56:36,343 --> 00:56:39,620
If it was him, why let Lane live,
much less help her?

611
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:43,091
- And if he's as fast as you...
- Why let himself be seen?

612
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,252
Incoming!

613
00:56:56,797 --> 00:57:00,438
Sire, the aircraft has
been intercepted and nullified.

614
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,705
Would that all our shots be so lucky.

615
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:04,712
We have more than luck, Orm.

616
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,940
Death to the under-dwellers! Unh.

617
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:09,439
Kill them. Kill them all.

618
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:27,420
Behold man's final mad disgrace.

619
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:31,194
He chops his nose to spite his face.

620
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,541
You've got to put an end to this.

621
00:58:42,702 --> 00:58:45,546
You're going to destroy the only world
we've got.

622
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,447
You won't have it much longer,
surface-dweller.

623
00:58:58,084 --> 00:59:01,497
Plan B. Take down
as many on both sides as you can.

624
00:59:01,655 --> 00:59:04,158
Maybe we can kill enough of them
to call off this war.

625
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:34,995
Fight your way to the leaders.

626
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:38,864
Once we have Aquaman
and Wonder Woman, this war is over.

627
01:00:10,991 --> 01:00:12,834
You murdered my wife, Diana.

628
01:00:12,993 --> 01:00:16,372
She tried to assassinate me, Arthur.
I was protecting myself.

629
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,703
Yet you wear her helmet like a trophy.

630
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,243
No. A warning.

631
01:00:31,745 --> 01:00:33,588
I can't believe I ever loved you.

632
01:00:33,747 --> 01:00:35,021
You never did.

633
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:41,887
Now!

634
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:54,776
Shazam!

635
01:00:58,439 --> 01:00:59,884
Captain Thunder.

636
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:05,285
I'm happy to see that a real man is here
to watch the end of man's world.

637
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:11,422
Fall, damn it, fall!

638
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:26,329
Sweet.

639
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:38,874
I like your style, Batman.

640
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,083
A pity we never teamed up
when the world still existed.

641
01:02:43,243 --> 01:02:45,780
Batman and Grifter, the boy idiot.

642
01:02:45,946 --> 01:02:47,789
Take your team up the right flank and...

643
01:03:02,896 --> 01:03:05,877
Don't worry, Batman.
I'll stop the blood flow.

644
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:07,637
You'll be as good as new.

645
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:10,247
Don't be stupid, Allen.

646
01:03:10,404 --> 01:03:15,581
I may not be a very good doctor, but
even I know a dead man when I see one.

647
01:03:20,781 --> 01:03:24,160
- They're gonna die.
- We're dead already.

648
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:26,730
Find the speedster.

649
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,366
Flush him out.

650
01:03:28,522 --> 01:03:31,093
Change all this.

651
01:03:31,258 --> 01:03:32,458
No.

652
01:03:33,026 --> 01:03:35,438
I won't stand by while people are...

653
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:43,669
Hello, Barry.

654
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,408
Thawne.

655
01:03:46,873 --> 01:03:50,343
- I love what you've done with the place.
- This is all your fault.

656
01:04:11,231 --> 01:04:12,972
This has worked out so well.

657
01:04:13,133 --> 01:04:15,340
That's why I let Lois Lane see me,
you know.

658
01:04:15,502 --> 01:04:16,981
I knew it would bring you.

659
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,248
Not that you wouldn't have ended up here
anyway, you hero, you.

660
01:05:35,282 --> 01:05:37,455
What did you do to the world?

661
01:05:37,617 --> 01:05:39,290
Oh, Barry.

662
01:05:39,453 --> 01:05:41,694
That's the beauty of all this.

663
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:43,857
I didn't do any of it.

664
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:47,832
You did.

665
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:52,204
Think, Barry.

666
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:56,212
Isn't there some little thing, some little
good deed you might have done?

667
01:05:57,671 --> 01:06:01,244
- I saved someone.
- Yes.

668
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:06,546
I saved her. I saved Mom.

669
01:06:08,448 --> 01:06:11,827
- That's right.
- No. No.

670
01:06:11,985 --> 01:06:13,760
It wouldn't have changed all this.

671
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,560
It wouldn't have changed
what happened before her murder.

672
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,703
Bruce's parents, Clark's landing.

673
01:06:18,859 --> 01:06:21,897
Oh, but it did.

674
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:25,172
Break the sound barrier
and there's a sonic beam.

675
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:29,007
You broke the time barrier, Flash.
Time beam.

676
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:32,639
Ripples of distortion radiated out
through that point of impact,

677
01:06:32,806 --> 01:06:35,548
shifting everything just a tiny bit.

678
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:36,909
But enough.

679
01:06:37,043 --> 01:06:40,217
Enough for events to happen
slightly differently.

680
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:44,786
I just wanted to save her.

681
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:49,195
Her hero. How noble. Oh, wait.

682
01:06:49,356 --> 01:06:52,565
You didn't stop JFK
from getting assassinated,

683
01:06:52,726 --> 01:06:55,229
or made sure Hitler stayed
in Art School.

684
01:06:55,395 --> 01:06:59,434
You saved your mommy.
You missed her.

685
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,708
And in a supreme act of selfishness,
shattered history like a rank amateur,

686
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:08,717
turned the world into a living hell
moments away from destruction.

687
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:10,479
And I'm the villain?

688
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,240
No!

689
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:43,977
This form is not your own.

690
01:08:44,137 --> 01:08:45,844
How is the enchantment broken?

691
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:49,010
With a word.

692
01:08:49,175 --> 01:08:51,917
Speak the word.

693
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:55,914
Shazam!

694
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:21,412
The era of the land-dweller
is at an end, hero.

695
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:28,048
Your metal skull
will decorate my great hall.

696
01:09:41,628 --> 01:09:43,073
Hero.

697
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:46,210
Friend.

698
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:21,967
Submit.

699
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,407
You are beaten.

700
01:10:25,572 --> 01:10:26,772
Surrender?

701
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,187
Then what?

702
01:10:30,343 --> 01:10:33,688
You'll let the men of Atlantis
live as your slaves?

703
01:10:33,847 --> 01:10:35,047
The men? No.

704
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:38,924
You are a pestilence the mother Gaia
has suffered for too long.

705
01:10:39,085 --> 01:10:44,694
- But perhaps Atlantis' daughters...
- There will be no glorious victor, Diana.

706
01:10:44,858 --> 01:10:46,058
No prize.

707
01:10:48,395 --> 01:10:51,672
What I do now,
I do for the good of all.

708
01:10:52,565 --> 01:10:54,101
As do I.

709
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:21,506
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out of here, before he...

710
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:28,345
It's too late.

711
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:41,249
Good job, Barry.

712
01:11:41,414 --> 01:11:45,123
The world is about to end, thanks to you.

713
01:11:45,285 --> 01:11:47,731
I hope your mother has a good view of it.

714
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:50,993
You can't let this happen, Thawne.
You'll die too.

715
01:11:51,157 --> 01:11:55,071
- As you say in this era, totally worth it.
- Unh.

716
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:03,472
As long as I can siphon off the Speed
Force, you can't escape this timeline.

717
01:12:03,636 --> 01:12:06,318
I'm afraid there just isn't enough
Speed Force to go around.

718
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:16,917
There is now.

719
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:18,784
You killed him.

720
01:12:18,852 --> 01:12:20,422
Not necessarily.

721
01:12:26,025 --> 01:12:28,631
Not if you go back in time and fix this.

722
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:40,144
The only way to save the world
is to keep this world from ever happening.

723
01:12:40,306 --> 01:12:42,377
Take this.

724
01:12:43,676 --> 01:12:45,519
Run.

725
01:13:53,112 --> 01:13:54,716
Barry!

726
01:13:54,881 --> 01:13:56,622
Stop, you'll kill everyone!

727
01:14:11,898 --> 01:14:15,641
Barry! Stop! You have to stop!

728
01:14:15,802 --> 01:14:17,577
What the hell?

729
01:14:18,404 --> 01:14:19,604
Get away.

730
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:46,536
Mom, I'm so sorry.

731
01:15:03,216 --> 01:15:04,416
- Barry.
- Ah!

732
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,691
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

733
01:15:06,853 --> 01:15:08,890
Gotta run, James.

734
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:14,101
You don't finish the files by Friday,
you'll be stuck here all weekend.

735
01:15:14,661 --> 01:15:17,505
Well, it's not the end of the world.

736
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:25,972
I think I finally got it, Mom.

737
01:15:26,139 --> 01:15:28,619
The things you were trying to teach me.

738
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:32,086
- Barry?
- Iris?

739
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:45,368
Well, heh, that's my kind of hello.

740
01:15:45,525 --> 01:15:49,803
- Is everything all right?
- It is now, honey.

741
01:15:51,097 --> 01:15:53,236
It is now.

742
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:57,339
Just to review,
you brake the <i>chronal</i> barrier,

743
01:15:57,503 --> 01:16:00,177
went back in time,
prevented your mother's murder

744
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,581
and completely changed
the time stream.

745
01:16:02,742 --> 01:16:05,416
Nearly destroying
the entire world along the way.

746
01:16:05,578 --> 01:16:06,886
Yes.

747
01:16:07,046 --> 01:16:09,151
There's still something
I don't understand.

748
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,817
I remember all of it.

749
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:15,455
Not just what happened after
I wake up there, but my whole other life.

750
01:16:15,621 --> 01:16:18,568
I remember every birthday cake
my mother ever baked me.

751
01:16:18,725 --> 01:16:21,296
My room, everything.

752
01:16:21,461 --> 01:16:24,533
Perhaps some kind of temporal
after-effect?

753
01:16:25,365 --> 01:16:28,744
Or perhaps it was a gift.

754
01:16:33,139 --> 01:16:35,676
Yes. A gift.

755
01:16:37,543 --> 01:16:39,682
This is my father's handwriting.

756
01:16:59,665 --> 01:17:02,509
You're one hell of a messenger.

757
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:04,413
Thank you.

758
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,520
