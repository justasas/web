SRU for two now.

28
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:58,921
I met Hank
and I started wondering,

29
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,323
is this all I am?

30
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,658

of the best cops

All of 'em.

The people they're choosing
to marry?

41
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:22,276
Maybe the job just
changes you.

42
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:24,345
I know I was a totally
different person

43
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:25,913

The Logan family.

343
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,941
Vice, undercover,
we did a huge op...

344
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,475
Over a year.

345
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:48,844
There was me, my partner,
there were some other cops.

346
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:50,779
But we were deep under;
I have no idea who they were.

347
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:52,681

You busted them wide open,

348
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,950
you sent the head of the family,
Calum Logan,

349
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,251
away for life, right?

350
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,986
Crown had enough evidence,
we didn't testify.

351
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:01,221
They're a real special kind
of mean, the Logans.

352
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:04,191
So our identities
were kept a secret.

353
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:05,726
Okay, let's move.

00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:08,829
Looks like the secret's out.

355
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,432
Okay, so we have at least
one active shooter,

356
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,901
possibly gunning
for former members

357
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:15,635
of Donna's undercover team.

358
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:17,303
Parker: It could be some
young up and comer,

359
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:18,738
trying to impress his new boss

360
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:21,174
and doesn't give a crap
about collateral damage.

361
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,608
Okay, Spike,

362
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:23,543
I need the names
of those undercover cops.

363
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,810
<i>Anybody gets in your way,</i>

364
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:25,973
<i>you call to the chief</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

365
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,713
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Let's find 'em
,</i> <i>bring 'em to SRU HQ.</i>

366
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:29,315
They'll be safer there.

367
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:31,750
Raf, you and I'll go talk
to the Logan family personally.

368
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:33,052
You think they'll talk to us?

369
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,986
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>I don't need them to talk.</i>

370
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:35,555
I just need them to listen.

371
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:36,989
Donna: I need to make one
of those calls myself.

372
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,657
Parker: No way, Donna.
You're going to SRU too.

373
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:39,824
You're laying low.

374
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:41,293
I'm a gun team leader, Greg.

375
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,595
Ed: Okay, Donna, we know
this is your old case...

376
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:45,129
The man who ran
the undercover squad,

377
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:47,031
Bill Kedrick,
my partner for three years.

378
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:48,333
He was closer to the Logans
than anybody.

379
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:50,202
If they know his name
or where he is,

380
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,203
- he's next.
- Fine.

381
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,504
We put an all call out,

382
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,705
if he's on shift,
he'll hear it.

383
00:15:53,772 --> 00:15:55,539
Yeah, but he took
a leave of absence.

384
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,140
He's in the wind.

385
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:59,176
He's not near a radio.
I know where he is.

386
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:00,678
I'm going to him.

387
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:01,612
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Okay, okay.</i> <i>You know what?</i>

388
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
You and I'll go, all right?

389
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:04,047
Grab a vest, we'll go.

390
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:07,884
She's on the edge, Eddie.

391
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:09,720
I know, I know.

392
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:12,322
I'm gonna keep her
from falling off.

393
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,456
Okay.

394
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:17,110
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Okay, team,</i>

395
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,229
<i>there were five UC officers</i>
<i>on the Logan case:</i>

396
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:22,098
<i>Sabine, Duceppe, Laputto,</i>
<i>Whitter and Kedrick.</i>

397
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:24,100
What's your status, guys?

398
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,202
We're putting Greg Duceppe
in a car right now.

399
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,936
That three leaves more
on the list.

400
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:29,871
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Just leaving Phil
Laputo's apartment.</i>

401
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,173
Unis are escorting to SRU
as we speak.

402
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,709
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>All right, that's good.</i>

403
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:36,144
That leaves us two former
undercover cops to bring in.

404
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:38,280
So far, no word on any other
attempted hits.

405
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:39,748
That's a good thing.

406
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,350
Jerry Whitter is next up.

407
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,950
<i>I want the three of you</i>
<i>to go find him.</i>

408
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,952
<i>He retired last year.</i>

409
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,154
What about the name Kedrick?

410
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,390
Ed and Donna have got
that one covered.

411
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,731
Well, then you better fix it,
I guess.

412
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,232
(Phone keys beep)

413
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:03,370
Yeah, it's me.

414
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:04,471
No, some complications.

415
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,973
<i>But nothing we can't fix.</i>

416
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:08,975
And Kedrick?

417
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:12,178
I'll handle him myself.

418
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:20,408
Still no answer?

419
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:21,776
No.

420
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,345
That doesn't mean anything.
He could be out,

421
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:25,412
or sleeping it off,
I don't know.

422
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,580
Yeah.

423
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:27,914
And no family we can contact?

424
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,316
<i>Donna:</i>
<i>No, he never settled down.</i>

425
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:32,586
He said with our life,
it wouldn't be fair.

426
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:34,321
We were his family.

427
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:35,489
<i>Ed:</i> <i>You know,</i> <i>when
I was in guns and gangs,</i>

428
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,391
<i>half the busts</i> <i>were due to him.</i>

429
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,525
I know.

430
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,060
He taught me a lot.

431
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,661
Yeah, three years undercover
together.

432
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,330
You must've been close.

433
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,333
Donna: Yeah, we were deep.
We were...

434
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,068
Just the two of us.

435
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:52,972
<i>He called me last night</i>
<i>to wish me congratulations.</i>

436
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,643
Hey, Don, it's me.

437
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,445
Uh...

438
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,115
Just saw the news and I just...

439
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,284
I'm probably the last guy
you wanna hear from,

440
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:09,254
but I just honestly
wanted to say...

441
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,390
Congratulations.

442
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,490
And um...

443
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,062
That's it, I guess.

444
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,166
Bye.

445
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,701
<i>Donna:</i> <i>Picked up the message</i>
<i>just before the wedding.</i>

446
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,538
You didn't invite him?

447
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,075
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Raf and I are</i>
<i>at the Logan's bar.</i>

448
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,113
Keep your sidearm ready.

449
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:38,481
What, you think
they'd draw on us?

450
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,316
I don't know
what they're gonna do.

451
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,388
Ida Logan?

452
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:48,657
(Sighs heavily)

453
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,260
I am through talking with cops.

454
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:54,763
My husband made no
deathbed confessions.

455
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,631
Stomach cancer takes
the talk out of you,

456
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:58,167
in the end.

457
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,536
When did your husband pass,
ma'am?

458
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:03,038
I'm losing track.

459
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:04,606
You folks keep finding reasons

460
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:05,840
not to release the body.

461
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:07,141
I don't know, two weeks?

462
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,243
Mrs. Logan,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

463
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:10,244
But what's happening right now,

464
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:11,512
what your family is doing?

465
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:13,715
It'll destroy you
and your family completely.

466
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:16,717
I'm sorry, what...
my family's doing?

467
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,419
What we're doing is grieving.

468
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:20,860
If this was
your husband's idea,

469
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,289
please,

470
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:24,157
take the opportunity
and call it off.

471
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:27,761
I am asking you, please,
to leave us alone now.

472
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,464
We have nothing to do
with your trouble.

473
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:32,599
Show some respect!

474
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:36,636
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>Uh, Mrs. Logan,</i>

475
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:39,538
one of the Garvis brothers
died today.

476
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,808
He worked for your family.

477
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,044
<i>Let me tell his mother</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

478
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:47,080
We already have one
of his brothers in custody

479
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,547
and we can bring
the other one in safely

480
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:50,082
if you'll just...

481
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:53,685
If you'll just stop this.

482
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:57,623
Having people you trust
sit with you,

483
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,591
act like family,

484
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:05,262
and then betray you
and leave you like this?

485
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,132
I would say
to those boys' mothers,

486
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,434
"I am sorry,
my heart breaks for you."

487
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:16,406
<i>But this is worse.</i>

488
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:20,590
Much... worse.

489
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,681
Thanks for your time.

490
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,988
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Boss, you there?</i>

491
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:31,788
Go ahead, Sam.

492
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,256
We're still looking
for Whitter.

493
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:35,591
No answer at his place,
no cell phone listed.

494
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,892
Spike:
Might have something.

495
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,927
Neighbour says
the Whitters play racquetball

496
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:40,562
every Friday.

497
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,964
<i>Club's at Bay and Charles.</i>
<i>Same club, every week.</i>

498
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,498
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Jules, you anywhere near there?</i>

499
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,068
I'm on my way.

500
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:48,037
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Okay, let me know</i>
<i>as soon as you find him.</i>

501
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:50,172
That guy who just left?
You get a look at his ring?

502
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:51,373
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>Nah.</i>

503
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,141
Police association.

504
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,809
You get it at retirement.

505
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:57,745
What's a retired cop doing
hanging around the Logans?

506
00:20:57,813 --> 00:20:59,180
That's what I'd like to know.

507
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:05,153
22, right?
Yeah.

508
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,322
(Knocks twice)

509
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,490
Bill?

510
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:11,858
(Knocks)

511
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:13,827
Bill, it's Donna.

512
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,997
(Door crashes open)

513
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:18,365
Donna:
Bill!

514
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,334
Bill? Are you in here?

515
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:24,971
<i>Bill.</i>

516
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,971
It's all right.

517
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,473
(Panting heavily)

518
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,741
Donna, what...

519
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:31,678
Arne't you supposed to be
getting married?

520
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:37,217
Whitter's game should be over;

521
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:38,618
I'm heading in.

522
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:42,221
We're on our way.

523
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:46,491
Woman:
Nice game.

524
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:48,960
Whitter:
Well, I was winning.

525
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,862
(Woman) - I know.
(Whitter) - I was winning.

526
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,931
Jerry Whitter, Metro PD?

527
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:55,100
Uh, used to be, yeah.
Everything all right?

528
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,235
It will be.

529
00:21:56,302 --> 00:21:57,801
I need you guys
to come to my truck.

530
00:21:57,869 --> 00:21:59,069
Okay.

531
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:00,204
Did you notice anybody
following you today,

532
00:22:00,272 --> 00:22:01,505
or anything
out of the ordinary?

533
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:02,506
No.
A nice quiet day.

534
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:03,673
(Gunshot blasts)

535
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:07,878
Shots fired.

You okay?

Yeah.
Okay.

Just tell me what I did, Don.

545

(Grunts) Mm...

547
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:39,607

No.

No, sir.
This isn't an intervention.

556

Good for you.

All right,
top of the parking garage.

00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:47,654
Southeast stairwell.

00:23:47,722 --> 00:23:48,722
You're gonna come up
behind him,

Donna:
It's not on you, Bill.

I should've been -
I used to be...

I could've at least been there
for you today.

You guys go, okay?

598
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:51,815
I'm gonna head down to vice

Will you wait for them?
Swear.

Swear you'll stay right here.

612
00:25:17,874 --> 00:25:18,940
Lock the door.

<i>Just lock the door.</i>

You should've seen him

He's why I left undercover.

'Cause that's
what happens to you.

Is that what you're gonna say
when they got you downtown?

652
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:39,206
Why all your old friends
are being hunted down?

653
00:27:39,274 --> 00:27:40,573
'Cause you saw my pawnshop ring

654

Bill:
I never gave you their names!

656
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:46,546
Not their full names.
But you gave me plenty:

00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:49,248
First names, dates and details.

658
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,250
Enough to lead to the death
of several people.

659

we're both cops.

No, no... the other cop.
The UC who was with you.

00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:04,396
Who? This is the guy

Jerry!

665
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:08,701
Did I tell you Jerry

I mean, you're in it

674
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:32,789
If the force thought of you

Sort of a freelance consultant
to the criminal underworld.

00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:50,957
Well, since he got out,

704
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:53,594
vice is trying
to keep tabs on him.

705
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,127
Let me see.

706
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,831
Donna, that's Bill Kedrick's
apartment building.

707
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:04,370
Gotta be a good reason
for that.

708
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:06,105
Kedrick would never deal
with the Logans.

709
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,408
<i>Parker:</i> <i>This photo was
taken</i> <i>last week, Donna,</i>

710
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,738
and they have others too.

711
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:11,078
<i>Donna:</i> <i>Well, if vice saw
him</i> <i>at Bill's place,</i>

712
00:30:11,198 --> 00:30:12,095
<i>why didn't they</i>
<i>pick him up there?</i>

713
00:30:12,215 --> 00:30:13,219
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>They didn't know.</i>

714
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:14,646
Donna, you said yourself,
he moves around.

715
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:15,747
He hasn't been on the job
in a while.

716
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,716
He's off the radar.

717
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:18,817
And ask yourself this:

718
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,018
Who else would know
the identities

719
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,453
of those undercover cops?

720
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:23,388
The man I know
would never do it. Never!

721
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:25,123
Donna, you said yourself,

722
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,491
you don't even know this guy
anymore.

723
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,126
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Vice just wants
to sit down</i> <i>with him,</i>

724
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:31,194
get it all straightened out.

725
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,362
You know, the gunman
got the jump on me

726
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:33,597
because he went for Carol.

727
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,865
We thought
he was after whitter,

728
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,734
but he was actually after
Whitter's wife.

729
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,135
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>And the shooting today,</i>

730
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,304
the victim is the wife
of an undercover cop.

731
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,906
<i>Parker:</i> <i>That picture of
you</i> <i>that they had...</i>

732
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,640
In Mexico -
me and Hank.

733
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:45,308
<i>Sam:</i> <i>They weren't ever
trying</i> <i>to get the cops.</i>

734
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,243
No, they're after the wives
and your husband.

735
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:49,846
Hank's at the hospital.

736
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:52,348
I mean, even if it is true,

737
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,017
hitting that wedding,
that's risky.

738
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:56,653
(Cell phone rings)

739
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:00,021
Yeah.

740
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:04,125
You're kidding me?
Where the hell is he?

741
00:31:04,193 --> 00:31:06,462
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>
<i>Thanks, thanks.</i>

742
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:07,930
Hank's not at the hospital.

743
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:09,498
He just left with
a plainclothes police escort.

744
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:10,666
It's him.
It's Kedrick.

745
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:13,401
He ducked the escort.
It's him.

746
00:31:17,673 --> 00:31:19,106
Hank: We should call
Donna, let her know.

747
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:20,475
I told you,
first thing we need to do

748
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:22,009
is to get you to a safe place.

749
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:24,078
But what does this
have to do with me?

750
00:31:24,145 --> 00:31:26,313
<i>Kedrick:</i> <i>Look, you may have
been</i> <i>the target, all right?</i>

751
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:29,450
Donna would want you
to be safe.

752
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:31,918
She ever tell you about me?

753
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:33,553
Yeah, she did.

754
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:35,789
Yeah? What'd she say?

755
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:38,358
She said you were
the best partner she ever had,

756
00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:40,694
and her best friend.

757
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:43,396
Right. So...

758
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:44,998
Trust me on this, all right?

759
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:51,537
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Guys, I got a lock on
the GPS</i> <i>on Hank's phone.</i>

760
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,071
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

761
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:54,607
Let's see if we can figure out
where they're going.

762
00:31:54,674 --> 00:31:56,274
<i>Spike:</i> <i>Ed, that
turn-off</i> <i>they just took,</i>

763
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:58,010
there's an empty warehouse.

764
00:31:58,077 --> 00:31:59,912
Let's bring in the E.M.T.

765
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,614
<i>Donna:</i>
<i>Bill took the Logan's down.</i>

766
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:02,981
I don't care
what happened after,

767
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:05,349
he was the best guy
undercover ever had.

768
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,985
If he has Hank,

769
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,721
then he's doing it because
he's trying to keep him safe.

770
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:11,956
Donna, I saw his file.

771
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:13,224
He didn't take
a leave of absence,

772
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,526
he was let go.

773
00:32:15,494 --> 00:32:17,495
<i>"Conduct unbecoming."</i>

774
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,362
The drinking,

insubordination...

776
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,332
<i>Donna:</i> <i>He was undercover
too long,</i> <i>Greg.</i>

777
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,600
He needed help.

778
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:24,902
And when he started to stumble,

779
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:27,538
everybody that he trusted
and worked with

780
00:32:27,605 --> 00:32:28,972
didn't wanna see the price
that he paid,

781
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,942
so they just turned
their backs on him.

782
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,644
Like being "weak"
was contagious.

783
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:35,377
(Knock at the door)

784
00:32:38,515 --> 00:32:39,715
Hey.

785
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,918
Kedrick:
I got nothing to say to you.

786
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:43,019
Donna:
I'm sorry, Bill.

787
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,319
Kedrick:
I don't want to hear it.

788
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:47,690
I sat in that hearing
for half an hour, alone.

789
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:48,791
My team, my brothers,

790
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:49,892
they all turned
their backs on me.

791
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,292
But you, Donna?

792
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,117
I had a call.

793
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:53,728

795
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,730

She's going to be here.

797
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,000
I planned to be there.

798
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:02,236
I had a call.
I'm an SRU team leader, Bill,

799
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:03,939
I got more than one back
to watch.

800
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:05,106
You remember
what I said to you,

801
00:33:05,174 --> 00:33:07,407
first day we were
on the job together?

802
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:08,876
I said, "whatever happens
in this job,

Okay.

810
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,024
Remember what the other thing
you said to me that day was?

811
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:26,525
To be a good undercover,
you don't lie.

812
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:29,829
Because the lies are harder
to remember then the truth.

00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,185
by both of you
dropping your guns.

873
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,021
Kedrick: I didn't mean for
this to happen, Don, I swear.

874
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,390
Donna: Don't say anything
to me, Bill.

875
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,725
We gotta listen
to what he has to say;

876
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:35,959
that's what we do here.

877
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,194
Donna:
No, not him. No more.

878
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,630
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Bill, you were a good cop.</i>

879
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,800
(Whimpers) Yeah, I wa...

880
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,202
I was a good cop.

881
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,436
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>You did your job,</i>

882
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:49,205
got your man, and then...

883
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,240
Where were you, Don?

884
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:53,475
Don't talk to me!

885
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:55,277
Look at me, Bill.

886
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:56,278
I hear you.

887
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:58,513
<i>You got left behind.</i>

888
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:01,116
When I was alone,
where were you?

889
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:03,585
Where were you?!
I was there always!

890
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:06,488
Always.

891
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:07,672
You pushed me away.

892
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,865
How many nights did I take
your drunk ass home?!

893
00:37:09,985 --> 00:37:11,097
Where were you
when it mattered?

894
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:13,394
I was alone in that bar.

895
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:15,763
The guy comes in and...

896
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:18,099
He told me he was a cop,

897
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,501
and he talked to me
like I still mattered.

898
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:22,636
<i>Donna:</i> <i>All the people that
trusted</i> <i>and believed in you, Bill,</i>

899
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:25,271
and you gave it up
to some guy in a bar?!

900
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:28,575
Parker:
Donna, you're not helping.

901
00:37:28,642 --> 00:37:30,010
Please...

902
00:37:30,912 --> 00:37:33,379
We all do it, right?
(Whimpers uncontrollably)

903
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:35,849
When we trust each other,
we tell our secrets...

904
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,417
When we're alone!

905
00:37:37,484 --> 00:37:38,919
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

906
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:40,686
<i>Yeah, you didn't mean</i>
<i>to give those names up,</i>

907
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:41,854
did ya?

908
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:44,323
<i>I know.</i>

909
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,793
I know that you didn't know
who he worked for, right?

910
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:49,661
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Donna, he is
gonna face</i> <i>justice,</i>

911
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,496
but we have to do this right.

912
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:53,766
You shot my husband...

913
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,667
In the back, Bill.
In the back.

914
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:57,301
Do you remember doing that?!

915
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:58,770
Kedrick: I did that for you!
I did it to save you!

916
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:00,905
<i>Donna:</i>
<i>What're you talking about?!</i>

917
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:04,375
After you left,
they put a gun in my hand.

918
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:05,676
They told me I was the only one

919
00:38:05,745 --> 00:38:07,011
who could get
your husband alone;

920
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,082
that he had to die.
That's what Logan wanted.

921
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,515
Logan's already dead.

922
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,184
Wasn't him.

923
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:15,886
It was Ida, it was his wife.

924
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:17,888
She wanted the hit.

925
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:20,924
<i>Not at the cops,</i>
<i>but at their families.</i>

926
00:38:20,992 --> 00:38:23,761
They told me if I didn't do it,
<i>if I went to the cops,</i>

927
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:26,429
that they would kill you.

928
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:30,199
I couldn't let that happen,
Donna.

929
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,501
I'm sorry.
(Cries pitifully)

930
00:38:34,238 --> 00:38:35,371
I'm so sorry.

931
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:39,475
No!
(Fires weapon)

932
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:40,709
No.

933
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,945
His gun's down,
he's not a threat.

934
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:44,900
<i>You're a police officer.</i>
<i>Get back, guys.</i>

935
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,981
I don't care what I am.

936
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:48,116
Ed: Give her some room.
Donna, you're a police officer.

937
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:49,251
I wanna kill him.

938
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:51,386
Donna, I don't believe that.

939
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:53,221
<i>Come on now.</i>

940
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,322
<i>Donna:</i> <i>You're not supposed</i>
<i>to contradict me, Ed.</i>

941
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,391
Don't contradict me.

942
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,759
<i>I wanna kill him.</i>

943
00:38:57,827 --> 00:39:00,052
- Donna...
- I wanna kill him.

944
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,296
Donna, come on now.
I hear you're angry,

945
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:05,299
but shooting him's
not gonna solve anything.

946
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:06,700
It's not gonna make you
feel better.

947
00:39:06,768 --> 00:39:08,169
<i>Donna:</i>
<i>I don't wanna think, Ed.</i>

948
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:09,503
Shut up!

949
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:12,506
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Can I tell you what I think?</i>

950
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:14,708
I think that man right there,

951
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:17,277
that you once loved
and admired,

952
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:19,813
I think that no matter
how far he's fallen,

953
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,347
no matter what
he's been through,

954
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:24,851
he is still the man
that made you who you are today.

955
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,319
Now, you shoot him, Donna,
it's over.

956
00:39:26,386 --> 00:39:28,087
<i>You will lose everything.</i>

957
00:39:28,155 --> 00:39:29,522
<i>You will never have</i>
<i>the life you want.</i>

958
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:31,157
<i>Donna:</i>
<i>But I...</i>

959
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:33,491
<i>You know the life I wanted</i>
<i>and he took it away.</i>

960
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,560
And what do I have now?

961
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:38,630
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>That's up to you.</i>

962
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:41,399
<i>That's up to you.</i>
<i>It always is, come on.</i>

963
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:42,567

after four weeks

986

of doing nothing all day.

you ever think of a honeymoon?

Love a honeymoon,

All right, just promise me

992

it's not daiquiris
