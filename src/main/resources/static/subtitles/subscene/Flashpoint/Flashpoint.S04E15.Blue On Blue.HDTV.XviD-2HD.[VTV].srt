cracked it open

40
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,594

<i>It's just a weekend, Spike.</i>

Sam?

Primary good.
Spike?

Good with you, man?

I mean...

84
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,776
Okay, last night,

85
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,511
Natalie came home
from coffee with you

86
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,846
and she seemed upset.

87
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:02,180
She was upset?

88
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,649
Well, she was trying
to hide it, yeah.

89
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,851
She asked if you ever stop
with the "kidding around."

90
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:07,485
I don't know, I make jokes,

91
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,019
it's what I do.

92
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,455
You usually your sister's
wing-man?

93
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:12,724
I'm not her wing-man,
okay?

94
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,260
You know what?
Never mind.

95
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:16,394
We're not dating.

96
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:20,097
Well, that's good

97
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,866
'cause that would be weird.

98
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,167
Trouble has a way
of finding her.

<i>David:</i>
<i>Yeah, bank foreclosed.</i>

100
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,806
A friend of mine
told me about it,

00:03:29,874 --> 00:03:31,174
<i>I got it for cheap.</i>

102

You look good.

104
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,447
So do you.

(Chuckles)

106
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,783
Don't sound so surprised.

107
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,951
I just mean considering...

108
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:46,789
Considering everything?

109
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:49,458
Yeah.

110
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:52,895
Well, I'm really glad
that you're doing well,

111
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:54,363
I mean it.

112
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:55,264
David: Yeah.
Speaking of which, this is my uh...

113
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:57,098
My business partner, Albin.

114
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,033
Hey.

115
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:00,602
Natalie, right?

116
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,470
David: Oh, yeah, he knows
everything about you.

117
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:05,607
How you, uh, dazzled your way
into my life,

118
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:06,675
made yourself at home
in my villa,

119
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:07,875
drank my booze,

120
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:08,976
swam in my pool...

121
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:10,044
You were my personal
house guest

122
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,112
for, what, two months,

123
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,047
and then you threw me
to the dogs

124
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:15,283
and breezed away.

125
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,984
Wait a minute, I threw you?

126
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,085
What would you call it?

127
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,087
You packed the bag.
I trusted you.

128
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:22,156
You have no idea!

129
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,435
David: You know, there's no
rules in Colombian jails.

130
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,904
No, um, guards to keep one guy

131
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,906
from doing whatever
to another...

132
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:41,975
Unless you've got something
to bribe 'em with.

133
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:43,109
No one to turn to.

134
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:44,109
You can beg and you can scream,

135
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:46,378
but nobody hears you.

136
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:47,779
Every night, I go back there.

137
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:52,284
I can still smell them
on my skin.

138
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:53,719
I am so sorry,

139
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:55,721
but I did not mean
for any of that to happen.

140
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:56,922
Aggghhh!

Didn't the word go out,
no work on this route?

00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,205
There's a lot of news
satellite hookups

for the Morse hearing.

172
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:28,574
It's too high for that.
It's very specific,

173
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:30,310
so it can't be triggered
accidentally.

174
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:32,245
Spike, you find the location
of the trigger man?

175

</i> <i>Raf and I are heading west.</i>

178
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:40,685
I got it jammed for now,
but if he switches signals...

179
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,254
Copy that, boss.

180
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:44,056
I'm trying the nearest building
with a good vantage.

181
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,490
Copy that.

182
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:47,059
Jules, let's clear those people
outta here.

183
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:49,461
All right, let's move away
from the truck immediately.

184
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:51,963
Move away from the truck now!

185
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,667
Ed: Right there. Bad idea.

186
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:58,436
Freeze right there.

187
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,137
Really bad idea.
Turn around.

188
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:01,138
Put the phone on the ledge,

<i>Parker:</i> <i>Morse is en route to the

guy you bagged last year

195
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,823
at the Lakeshore warehouse?

196
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,692
Yeah, three million worth
of heroin.

197
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,326
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Yeah. Now we just risked</i>
<i>our butts off to save his life.</i>

198
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:27,062
So we can safely get
his sorry butt back in jail.

199
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,630
Must be nice
to get a little closure.

200
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,432
Justice league!
(Spike's phone rings)

201

219
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:12,104
I gotta take care of.

220
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:13,406
If we're all done here,

221
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,207
I'll just come back after
to debrief, okay?

222
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,009
Holleran's gonna wanna hear
about the IED, Spike.

223
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:18,210
Yeah, I know,
and I'll be there.

224
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:19,678
Just...
Your mom?

225
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,580
Uh, it'll be quick.

226
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:23,516
You do it in an hour?

227

Half that.

229
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:26,618

Natalie has told me

Hey, don't worry about it,

Tie her up.

Now, I don't know exactly
what you expect...

274
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,790
<i>Albin:</i> <i>We expect you to hack</i>
<i>into the security mainframe</i>

275
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:45,292
with a spoofed ID
to cover your tracks,

276
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:47,360
override the ID line system

277
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:49,162

278
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:50,697
while you're doing it.

279
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:53,766
Now, I've already got you routed
through an encrypted VPN.

280
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,201
Okay.

281
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,503

<i>You don't need me.</i>
<i>Or Natalie.</i>

Albin:
But we don't have passwords.

288
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:09,081
So you gotta get them

289
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,348
David:
And you gotta move fast

290
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,216
because we are fighting
the clock.

291
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:12,050
What's the rush?

292
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,218
Evidence protocol.

293
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:15,887
What we want gets destroyed
end of shift.

294
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:17,689
That is at 4:00.

295
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:18,656

and to the main evidence depot.

297
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,059
Now, if you need
more persuasion...

298
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,694
Natalie: - Agghhh!
Spike: - No! Okay, okay!

299

And now...
We're into the main security system.

313
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:00,595

I'm ready for them.

315

00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:17,511
<i>Spike:</i> <i>Okay, first
gate's</i> <i>a standard ID check.</i>

319
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:18,980
I set them both up
with a dummy number;

320
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:19,981
it'll check out.

321
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,715
That's the easy part.

322
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:22,850
But once they're in,

323
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,217
if I can't move fast enough,

324
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,652
there is no turning back.

325
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,389
Then you better move fast,
Spike.

326
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:41,533
Man 2:
Bagged and tagged.

327
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:42,768
Down from 52.

No turning back.

332
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,687
Get them in and out.

340
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:23,140
What?
They found the hack?

341
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,341
No. To get through
the second gate,

342
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:25,575
you need the latest password.

343
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,110
You usually get that
via secure email,

344
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:28,845
but I can't find it.
If I had more time...

345
00:13:28,912 --> 00:13:30,279
We don't have more time.

346
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:36,586
Well, here we are...

347
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:37,620
They're at the gate.

348
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:38,688
I told you, once we're...

349
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:39,656
They're at the gate,
get them in.

350
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:41,090
Albin:
David, this hack,

351
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:42,625
the cops will be on us
if we don't move fast.

352
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:43,760
We're moving fast.

353
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:45,461
This is risky.
This is our shot.

354
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:46,795
Spike:
Okay, I got an idea.

355
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:47,629
I'm sending them a password
right now.

356
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:48,864
It's gonna be wrong,

357
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:49,798
you tell 'em to punch it in
anyway.

358
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:51,299
Why?
What're you trying to do?

359
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:53,134
An incorrect password'll set off
an alert in the server.

360
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:54,670
It'll try to verify
the number...

361
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:57,038
Spike: Yeah.
Three times before sounding an alarm.

362
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:58,774
The system's open
during the verification.

363
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,508
And I wanna jump in
during that pause

364
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:01,942
and reset the password.

365
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,444
That way the system will think
it's correct.

366
00:14:03,512 --> 00:14:04,612
What kind of pause?
How long?

367
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,880
Spike:
Half a second.

368
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:07,615
That's the best I can do.

369
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:08,716
(Keys clack)

370
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,787

He's sending a password,

371
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,555
<i>but there's a catch.</i>

372
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:16,257

373
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:17,424

(Keys clack)

381
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,392
- Last chance.

390
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,253
All right.
Two down, one to go.

393
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:28,590

00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:34,563
you're gonna let me

David:
(Laughs)

399
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,400
Wow.
You hear that, Nat?

400
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:40,702
<i>Even after you trick him</i>

407
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:52,647

00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:54,415
<i>and she's on a plane</i>
<i>right back home.</i>

409
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:55,550
Dave, focus.

410
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,588
See, lucky for me,
I had a good friend,

411
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:04,492
<i>who, after 10 months,</i>
<i>tracks me down in hell</i>

412

No. She doesn't get
to walk away.

424
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:29,616
Not this time.

Tell him to fire his weapon.

447
00:17:30,907 --> 00:17:32,074
What?

<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Your guy on the inside,</i>

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,844
tell him shoot
at the fire alarm.

450
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:38,012
If he shoots at the fire alarm,

451
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,681
the doors will open

452
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:41,883
and the guards will fall back
when a live round is fired;

453
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:42,984
that's the protocol.

454
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,589

That place is like Fort Knox.

<i>Spike:</i>
<i>When the fire alarm goes off</i>

479
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:27,847
<i>Team one is a man short,</i>

480
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,182

<i>in the perimeter.</i>

481
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:30,783
We're gonna have a window
before backup shows up.

482

487
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,490
I have the doors unlocked.

488
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:40,692
You wanna tell me

490

Spike, I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

491
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:46,598
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

492
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:47,899
I set off the alarm on purpose.

493
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,800
No! No.
Just do what they say.

494

we become a liability

499

to kill us, okay?

500
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:02,546
I have to draw this out,

501
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,248

<i>Winnie:</i> <i>There's no trace</i>
<i>on his vehicle's GPS.</i>

522
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,922
This is an all-call
for Officer Spike Scarlatti,

523
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,658
badge number 3-4-niner-6.

524
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:54,227
Repeat, Officer Spike Scarlatti
of the Strategic Response Unit,

525
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,829
report in.

526
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:57,164
If you have any information
on his current whereabouts,

527
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:59,465
<i>you need to report</i>
<i>to the SRU immediately.</i>

528
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,335
Come on, Spike, where are you?
Where are you?

529
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,370
<i>Albin:</i> <i>Okay, Spike,</i>
<i>what's the SRU's plan?</i>

530
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:05,872
<i>Spike:</i> <i>They're gonna set
up</i> <i>a command post,</i>

531
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,174
<i>then make a beeline</i>
<i>for the evidence room.</i>

532
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,308
David: - Time?
Spike: - Minutes.

533
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,243
Kenton:
We're in.

534
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,213
Even with the number though...

535
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,648
It'll take some time.

536
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,286
This had better work.

537
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,087
Like I told you,
you do what I tell you,

538
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,622
<i>they're not gonna know</i>
<i>what hit 'em.</i>

539
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,623
<i>They're entering</i>
<i>the surveillance room</i>

540
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:25,623
<i>right now.</i>

541
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,624
But not for long.

542
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,959

546
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,271
<i>Unit commander:</i>
<i>It's been hacked.</i>

547
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,504
The alarm's on
a perpetual loop;

00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:43,606
you don't even know
what it's flagging.

549
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:45,342

<i>Parker:</i> <i>Most secure
building</i> <i>in the city, Eddie,</i>

551

cracked it open

552
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:48,745

553
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,413
Okay, okay.
You stay here, boss.

554
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:51,614
Let's get us back online.

555
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:54,117

Let's move it.

556
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,854

567
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:32,853
Albin: - Out the back?
Spike: - Yeah.

568
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,654
Tell me where to go.

571
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:39,592
Let's go.

Main board is here,
didn't come from us.

577
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,475
Can you get back in?

578
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:57,810
<i>Unit commander:</i>
<i>No. The hack's from off-site.</i>

579
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:59,879
Pretty much impossible,
but somehow they did it.

580
00:21:59,946 --> 00:22:02,080
Maybe they knew the system.
An inside job maybe?

581
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:03,549
If they're good enough
to do this...

582
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:05,518
What went wrong?
Why'd the alarm go off?

583
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,352
<i>Unit commander:</i> <i>The alarm
wasn't triggered</i> <i>from inside.</i>

584
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:09,888
That was set off remotely, too.

585
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,022
What?

586
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:15,660
Guys, the gate alarm
that triggered all this

587
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:17,695
<i>was set off deliberately,</i>

588
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:19,030
from the outside.

589
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:20,465
Why would they blow the whistle
on themselves?

590
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,266
Sam:
Doesn't make sense.

591
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:23,401

Boss, eyes?

592
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:24,735
Parker:
Still blind, buddy.

593
00:22:31,943 --> 00:22:33,243
David:
They're not gonna have time.

594
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,144
Albin: You need to
slow your guys down.

595
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,913

Boss, what's that?

598
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,250
What is that?

599
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,517
It's a number three.

600
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:43,953
Southwest quadrant.

601
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,588
Looks like an exit, Eddie.

602
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,156
I thought all the alarms
were cut.

603
00:22:47,223 --> 00:22:48,558
There's fifty of them.
Maybe the bad guys missed one.

604

Looks like the other side
of the building.

617
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:26,727
What's your take on this?

618
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:28,963
So far,
the evidence locker's clear.

619
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,799
Sam: They must've split up,
headed in opposite directions.

620
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:35,268
That would take some serious
coordinating to do that.

621

Ed.

622
00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:41,341

694
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,437
No, that's bad idea.

695
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:01,172
That stuff,
it's really unstable.

696
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,973
David: He's worked with it before,
he knows what he's doing.

697
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,175
No, listen,
there's another route.

698
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:05,443
(Stammers, frantic)
Just... close...

699
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:06,910
They're like almost outside.
Listen to me.

700
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:08,579
Shut up! Shut up!

701
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:09,212
<i>David:</i> <i>Guys, just do</i>
<i>what you have to do.</i>

702
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,013
Just do it fast.

703
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:38,840
Before I got

704
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:38,119
David, no.
You don't have to do this.

705
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,387
Listen to me, David.

706
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:40,688
David:
Almost there...

707
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:43,023
<i>They're just outside</i> <i>the door.</i>

708
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:44,091
Wait for it.

709
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:49,196
Ed:
Let's go.

710
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:51,965
Please, David, no.

711
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:53,767
<i>David: - Almost...</i>
<i>Spike: - No.</i>

712
00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:55,135
Guys, let's go.

713
00:26:59,273 --> 00:27:00,673
<i>Spike: - David, stop.</i>
<i>David: - One more second.</i>

714
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,908
Spike:
David...

715
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:05,377
Spike: - No!
David: - Almost...

716
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:08,915
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

717
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:11,250
Ed, Ed...

718
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:14,153
Ed: - Tar!
Sam: - C4! Move, move, move!

719
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,753
Spike: - No!
David: - Do it! Do it now!

720
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:17,689
Spike:
No! No!

721
00:27:17,756 --> 00:27:18,824
(Explosion booms)

722
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:24,662
Eddie!

723
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:28,633
<i>Anyone? Status?</i>

724
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:31,202
<i>Team one,</i> <i>somebody talk to me!</i>

725
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:32,569
(Muffled cries)

726
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:38,642
Hey.

727
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,444
Hey, hey, hey!

728
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,613
Why did you do that?

729
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:45,115
I did everything
that you wanted!

730
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:46,150
It's not over yet.

731
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:48,718
- It is for me.
- Get them out.

732
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:49,886
Why should I?

733
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:50,954
You already killed four cops,

734
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:53,655
what else can you do?!

735
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:55,623
Go ahead, threaten me,

736
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:57,092
it's done.

737
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:00,329
(Muffled screams)

738
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:01,596
Spike:
No!

739
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:04,032
Albin: - David!
Spike: - Leave her alone!

740
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,268
Natalie:
(Muffled scream)

741
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:08,069
No! Let her go!

742
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:09,237
Albin: - David!
Spike: - Leave her alone!

743
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:10,938
David, let's get outta here.

744
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:12,773
Finish what you started.

745
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:14,675
Finish what you started!

746
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:16,810
(Breathing heavily, seething)

747
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,014
(Irate)
Agh! Aggghhhhh!

748
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:22,683
Team one, talk to me!
Come on.

749
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,219
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>(Coughs) Boss, no harm.</i>

750
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:31,191
Sam got us out in time,
he got the door closed.

751
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:32,592
It's good to hear.

752
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:34,928
There's debris,
but we can get through.

753
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:38,131
Okay, you got an exit
east wing hall...

754
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,632
<i>One flight up.</i>

755
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,766
Okay, Sam, Jules,

756
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,934
circle around from the outside.

757
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:43,802
Raf, you and me.

758
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,237
Okay, me and you here.

759
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:46,405
Slow and careful.

760
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:48,840
(Keys clack, computer beeps)

761
00:28:54,147 --> 00:28:55,147
They're on the move.

762
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:56,381
What?

763
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,682
<i>Albin:</i>
<i>They're closing in.</i>

764
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,052
We're done.
We're done.

765
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,653
It's time to cut our losses,
David.

766
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,022
David: No-no-no-no-no-no.
We're almost there.

767
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:05,456
We just,
we gotta see this through!

768
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:06,791
What? No...
(Stammers)

769
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:08,293
No, David,
we're not almost there,

770
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,193
this is a mess.

771
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:10,261
No, it's not a mess.

772
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:11,896
We can't be here, David.

773
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:13,496
We're out of time.

774
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:14,664
<i>You know, they're probably</i>
<i>already tracking us.</i>

775
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:16,633
Listen to me, okay?
We can still do this.

776
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,867
Albin:
No, I said we're done!

777
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,137
You are not calling the shots
here, okay!

778
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:22,672
Oh yeah?
It's time to call it a day.

779
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,208
<i>David:</i> <i>Hey! Hey!
</i> <i>We still need him!</i>

780
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:26,810
Albin: - Shut up!
Spike: - You don't wanna do this!

781
00:29:26,877 --> 00:29:28,377
David:
We're not through, Albin!

782
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:29,511
<i>Albin:</i>
<i>Him first, then her.</i>

783
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,547
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

784
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:32,982
No! We're doing this
my way!

785
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,151
Put the gun down!
(Gunshot pops)

786
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:47,963
This doesn't change anything.

787
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,564
I bought you five minutes.

788
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,899
<i>Get them out.</i>
<i>Get them out!</i>

789
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:55,003
Team one, I've got Spike's
last phone conversation

790
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:56,338
from the auto-transcripter.

791
00:29:56,405 --> 00:29:57,973
Give it to us, Winnie!

792
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,407
<i>Winnie:</i> <i>Okay, I was only
able</i> <i>to get his half,</i>

793
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:01,909
so I'm not sure how much sense
this is gonna make.

794
00:30:01,977 --> 00:30:04,378
It starts,
"hey, it still isn't you."

795
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:06,681
Then, "I can come by
after shift."

796
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:08,148
<i>Then, "who's David?"</i>

797
00:30:08,216 --> 00:30:10,184
<i>Then, "get you?</i>
<i>Are you in trouble?</i>

798
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:11,218
<i>I'm gonna tell Sam."</i>

799
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:12,419
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Natalie...</i>

800
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:13,821
Jules: - Who's David?
Sam: - I know him.

801
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:15,089
<i>He's trouble.</i>
<i>What else did Natalie say?</i>

802
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:16,357
<i>Winnie:</i>
<i>Spike was getting directions.</i>

803
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:17,524
He said,
"that's near Witchwood, right?"

804
00:30:17,592 --> 00:30:19,359
Well, it narrows it down
to a neighbourhood.

805
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:20,360
Okay, it's a place to start.

806
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:21,995
I'm on my way.

807
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:23,930
<i>Winnie, you get me some more</i>
<i>by the time I get there.</i>

808
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,064
Sam:
Boss, I'm coming with you.

809
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:26,766
Sam, can you do this with me?

810
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:27,934
She's my sister.

811
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:29,302
Okay, Sam,
you're with the boss.

812
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,671
Jules, command post
in case we get our eyes back.

813
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:32,771
Raf, it's you and me.

814
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,672
They're armed to the teeth.

815
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,007
So are we.

816
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:40,679
Kenton: 'Kay, pop this thing.
Let's go.

817
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:41,914
Why's that door locked?

818
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:43,281
The locks must've reset.

819
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:44,383
Unset them.

820
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:47,820
It's no use, it's manual.

821
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,153
We shoot this,
the unis know we're here.

822
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:50,354
<i>Kenton:</i>
<i>We need another exit.</i>

823
00:30:50,422 --> 00:30:51,288
Scarlatti, this exit's no good.

824
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:52,456
They need something different.

825
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:55,059
I'm looking.
(Computer trills)

826
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:01,198
(Computer beeps)

827
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:04,168
<i>Sam:</i> <i>Natalie was
traveling</i> <i>for three years.</i>

828
00:31:04,236 --> 00:31:06,537
She had her freedom,
she was happy, you know?

829
00:31:06,604 --> 00:31:09,806
And the day she's coming home
we get a call from Bogota,

830
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:11,474
she's in jail.

831
00:31:11,543 --> 00:31:13,510
Apparently she's unaware
that this guy she met,

832
00:31:13,578 --> 00:31:15,913
David, had packed her suitcase
with heroin.

833
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,147
Luckily for her,

834
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:19,382
his fingerprints
were all over the place.

835
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,317
So my dad pulled
every string he had.

836
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,619
As long as she testified
against him,

837
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:24,921
the charges would be dropped.

838
00:31:24,988 --> 00:31:26,689
There's no love lost
between this David

839
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:28,724
and Natalie then.

840
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,292
<i>Sam:</i> <i>I'm guessing he'd be happy</i>
<i>to see her out of the picture.</i>

841
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,161
Hey, Eddie,
we have to stall for time.

842
00:31:32,228 --> 00:31:34,964
<i>We need them</i>
<i>to need Spike alive.</i>

843
00:31:35,032 --> 00:31:36,331
Copy that.

844
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,532
Let's move.

845
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,768
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Okay, right there.</i>

846
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,269
They can backtrack
the way they came in.

847
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:42,270
That doesn't work.

848
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,504
That's the best I got.

849
00:31:43,573 --> 00:31:44,439
<i>David:</i>
<i>Find something else.</i>

850
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:45,540
Everything else is a dead end.

851
00:31:45,608 --> 00:31:47,141
Find another way.

852
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:52,447
It's okay, looks like
we're going in heavy.

853
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:53,681
How's this work?

854
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:55,115
They said the perimeter's
would be thin.

855
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,284
These are hollow point,
more effective.

856
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,119
We're gonna bust right through.

857
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:02,957
Boss, I think I got something.

858
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:05,158
Figured it had to be somebody
who knew what to look for.

859
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:07,962
Vince Albin,
mid-level soldier working for...

860
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:09,328
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Karl Morse.</i>

861
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,463
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>So he knew about the dope.</i>

862
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,298
There's gotta be dozen guys
who did.

863
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:13,967
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Yeah, but according to customs,</i>

864
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,768
when David Fleming flew back
into the country last month,

00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:17,136
he flew back in with Albin.

866
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:18,404
They have a history?

867
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:20,306
That doesn't tell us
where they are.

868
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,741
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Well, maybe it does.
</i> <i>'Cause after Morse got busted,</i>

869
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:24,143
all his assets were seized,
went into foreclosure,

870
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:25,677
including a bunch of houses.

871
00:32:25,745 --> 00:32:26,878
Any near Witchwood?

872
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:27,980
Sending you the number
right now.

873
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,451
Ed:
Police! Stay where you are!

874
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,754
<i>End of the line.</i>
<i>Time to put the guns down.</i>

875
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,656
<i>Do it now.</i>
<i>That's it, slow and careful.</i>

876
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:40,758
Sorry about this.

</i> <i>What're you doing?!</i>

878
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,964
Kenton:
Now, I have a hostage.

879
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,599
Kenton, what the hell
just happened?

880
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,600
What's going on?

881
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,468
You have a hostage?

882
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,137
<i>Kenton:</i>
<i>I shot Hollings.</i>

883
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,506
<i>The cop was getting too close;</i>
<i>I had to improvise.</i>

884
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:00,710
David:
(Exasperated sigh)

885
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,847
SRU caught up.
Kenton took Hollings hostage.

886
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,083
This was not the plan.

887
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,718
This was quick and clean,
in and out.

888
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:10,920
No one even knows.

889
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,622
(Cocks gun)

890
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:17,059
David, this could still work.

891
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:20,262
Your guy is right;
The team has to negotiate now,

892
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:21,530
<i>that's the protocol,</i>

893
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:23,331
and I can do it for you.
Gimme the mic.

894
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:26,902
Raf, that gate...

895
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:27,903
Raf:
Out flank 'em?

896
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:29,003
Go, now.

897
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,975
Hollings:
(Quick, tight breaths)

898
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:36,844
Give me the mic,
I can get them out.

899
00:33:36,912 --> 00:33:39,246
<i>But they have to do exactly</i>
<i>what I tell 'em to say.</i>

900
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:40,514
You have a gun.

901
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:42,717
If I don't get them out,
you can use it.

902
00:33:56,798 --> 00:33:58,732
Hey, can you hear me?

903
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,200
Mm-hm.

904
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:01,701
That was a smart thing
you did there,

905
00:34:01,768 --> 00:34:03,135
grabbing a hostage;

906
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:04,269
it changes the game.

907
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:05,871
Now, I can get you outta there,

908
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:07,139
<i>but you have to say exactly</i>

<i>Do you understand?</i>

910
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,374
Uh-huh.

911
00:34:09,442 --> 00:34:11,977
Start with,
"I just want to talk."

912
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:13,645
Kenton:
I just wanna talk.

913
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:16,848
Okay. You mind telling me
your name?

914
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,016
Trying to make
a personal connection.

915
00:34:18,084 --> 00:34:19,050
Tell him,
"I'll tell you my name,

916
00:34:19,118 --> 00:34:20,218
if you tell me yours."

917
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:21,385
Kenton:
You tell me yours,

918
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:22,420
I'll tell you mine.

919
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:23,588

922

How long you been

Come on now,

<i>Spike:</i> <i>Hey, Ed,</i>

Kenton: I don't wanna

<i>I want you</i>

or people could get hurt.

953
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:19,241
This guy's talking

Almost there.
