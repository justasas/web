Raf: - Excuse me.

(Gunshots pop)

19
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:48,077
And then we are trained

20

Now, this job isn't
about firing guns,

21

Okay. (Claps)

You guys,

31
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:10,697

Good. Good, good.

33
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:15,702
My son, Clark,
he's got other plans;

34
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:17,037

40
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,918
And it was actually
this guy's dad

41
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:35,154
who convinced me
to join this new unit--

42
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:36,355
the SRU.

43
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,691
<i>Wasn't easy--</i>

44

<i>Hundreds apply, few make it in.</i>

45
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:44,029
<i>First you take a psych test,</i>

46
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:45,797
<i>multiple choice--</i>

47
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:47,098
<i>what kind of cop are you?</i>
<i>What kind of human being? -</i>

48
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,967
1600 questions.

49
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:50,268
And you get through that,

50
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,871
<i>then it's fitness tests</i>
<i>and drills.</i>

51
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,706

182
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:07,966
So how is it goin'?

183
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:09,801
You tell me.

184
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:12,838
I think you're doing great.

185
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:15,039
But it's a two-way relationship,
you and the job.

186
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:16,040
You know what I'm saying?

187
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:17,574
I think so.

188
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,244
After a year,

189
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:22,079
you get a taste of how
the job's doing for you.

190
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:24,915
I hear you, boss.
It's all good.

191
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:26,416
Good. Okay.

192
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:29,986
So two girls, huh?

193
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,354
Raf: Actually, it was three,
but who's countin'?

194

195
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,132
David:
Yo! Tobias!

196
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,601
The new graphics look good.

197
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:46,902
Just finished programming.

198
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,504
David: Sweet! How's May?
Big night.

199
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:49,705
She's gonna be awesome!

200
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:52,975
Won't be long
till she's playing here.

201
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,377
Tobias:
You know it!

202
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:57,545
Can I help you?

203
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:00,849
Hey, we're not open yet!

204
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,650
James:
I'm here for him.

205
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:06,454
Hey!

206
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:07,922
We need to talk.

207
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,457
- What're you doing here?
- I need some information.

208
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:12,693
I'm not gonna talk to you.

209
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:15,195
Yes, you are gonna talk to me.

210
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:17,598
(Sirens wail)

211
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,601
Winnie, go for the 911...

212
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,003
David?

213
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,304
<i>David,</i>
<i>this is Sergeant Greg Parker,</i>

214
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,473
<i>I'm with the Strategic</i>
<i>Response Unit.</i>

215
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,275
Can you identify the gunman?

216
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,842
No idea.

217
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:32,345
He came in,
went straight for my friend.

218
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,579
<i>Parker: Okay. Does he know him?</i>

219
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,916
I don't know.
He's shouting at him--

220
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,017
James:
Tell me where she is!

221
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,751
You gotta get here.

222
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:39,752
Oof!

223
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Oh my God!

224
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,291
Parker:
What's going on?

225
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,225
I don't want to hurt you!
Tell me where she is!

226
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,927
Come on, David, talk to me.
What's happening?

227
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,663
Tell me now!

228
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,799
(Fighting grunts)

229
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,272
Ungh!

230
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,507
Aghhhh!

231
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,209
(Gunshot fires)

232
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,547

233
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,648
Eddie...

234
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,152
Get up! Get up!

235
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,153
Get up now!

236
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,454
Start walking!

237
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,555
David! David!

238
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,490
I'm here.

239
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,291
Don't engage him, please!

240
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,694
I just need you to tell me
what he is doing?

241
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:26,797
He's taking him outside.
He's getting away.

242
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:28,766
All right, we're almost there.
You hang tight.

243
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,867
<i>(Gunshot pops)</i>

244
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:31,335
I heard another shot!

245
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:33,470
David, stay inside!

246
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:35,472
Ed: Sam, take the
entrance on Richardson.

247
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,773
<i>Sam: Copy that.</i>

248
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,208
He's getting away,

249
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:40,844
I think he's got Tobias
in the car.

250
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,512
What kind of car is it?

251
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,413
Grey Sedan.
I can't make out the plate.

252
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,015
Ends in a one.
Sixty-one.

253
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,183
Sam, you get that?

254
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,484
(Sirens wail)

255
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,919
Affirmative.
We got him.

256
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:53,221
Raf:
Only one person in the car.

257
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,590

262
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:10,204
Spike: We got an image from the
CCTV, it's gone to your phones.

263
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,606
Jules:
No sign of Tobias.

264
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:12,773
Ed: If Tobias took a
blow to the head,

265
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,108
he could have passed out
in the car.

266
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:14,842
Parker: You heard
three shots, right?

267
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,477
David:
Yeah.

268
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:17,244
Ed: So one when you land,
and the second hit here...

269
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,212
And then one outside.

270
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,547
I'll call in forensics,

271
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:21,147
see if they can account
for the third.

272
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,983
Jules: We didn't see any impact
or ricochet marks outside.

273
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,485
You think he's been shot?

274
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:26,620
What's going on?

275
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,087
Excuse me, who are you?

276
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:29,222
May Dalton. The cop outside
told me to come in

277
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,590
and talk to you.

278
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:32,025
His girlfriend.

279
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:35,595
Where's Tobias?

280
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:38,397
Jules: Listen, May, your
boyfriend was taken by somebody.

281
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,966
- What?
- Somebody came in here, took him outside.

282
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,701
He was armed.

283
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:44,537
Ed: Okay, May, sit down--

284
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,704
May: No, I don't
need to sit down,

285
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:47,339
I need to know what's going on.

286
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:48,941
Ed: We're trying to figure
that out, all right? Spike.

287
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,809
Do you know this man?

288
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:54,612
Oh God...

290
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,183

360
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,976
<i>James: (Menacing) Your problem is</i>
<i>you just don't think.</i>

361
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,145
Michelle: James, I told
you about it last week.

362
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,547
<i>James:</i>
<i>You told me...</i>

363
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:07,915
Michele:
You said it was okay.

364
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,583
The sheets were only on sale
for the weekend--

365
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:11,652
James:
I said it was okay?

366
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,654
You did.

367
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,756
Are you telling me
what I remember now?

368
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:16,690
<i>Michelle: - No. Please...</i>
<i>James: - Are you?!</i>

369
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:18,257
<i>Michelle: No!</i>

370
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,659
James: Because now I have a
car payment that bounces.

371
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,627
- I'm sorry.
- I have a car payment that bounces

372
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,764
because you need new
(Smashes plate) sheets!

373
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,198
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>From now on,</i>

374
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,834
<i>you sign your cheques</i>
<i>over to me, Michelle.</i>

375
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,234
I give you what you need.

376
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,235
You don't need to do that.

377
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,604
Why not?

378
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,205
You planning on making
a move, Michelle?

379
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,342
- Don't...
- Don't you lie to me!

380
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,409
Dad?

381
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,215
Hey, May-be.

382
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,287
Uh, you finish
your Egyptian project?

383
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:51,956
Yeah...
Yeah, almost.

384
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:56,026
Hey um...
Do me a favour?

385
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,864
Help your mom clean up
the plates she broke.

386
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:02,032
You know how she gets.

387
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,401
Thank you, sweetie.

388
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:19,215
He took away all her money
so she couldn't leave,

389
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:20,517
made her think she was crazy,

390
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:22,885
and that he was the normal one.

391
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:25,654
May, moving out,
the restraining order.

392
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:27,255
<i>Your mom changing her name,</i>

393
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:30,058
<i>those are all things</i>
<i>that both of you did right,</i>

394
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,793
<i>and that past is behind you.</i>

395
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:34,530
But it's not!
I mean, look where I am.

396
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:35,864
I'm in a car with two cops.

397
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,298
I mean, no offense, guys,

398
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,633
but you really haven't done
the best job

399
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,401
of keeping him away.

400
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:45,439
<i>He called me today</i>
<i>'cause it's my birthday.</i>

401
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:47,808
How'd he get
my cell phone number?

402
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,144
<i>He even tracked down</i>
<i>where Tobias works.</i>

403
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,712
Now he knows where my mom works.

404
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,080
I mean, what are we supposed
to do?

405
00:15:55,783 --> 00:16:00,587
<i>Tobias has done everything</i>
<i>so that we can feel safe.</i>

406
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:05,759
But I guess that's just
not gonna happen.

407
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:13,465
(Patrons chatter and laugh)

408
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:18,437
- Hello.
- Hi.

409
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:19,905
James:
(Reading her nametag) Uh, Heather,

410
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:21,440
I wonder if you can help me,
I'm looking for someone.

411
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:22,942
Heather: Of course.
Is this person a guest with us today?

412
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,476
No. An employee.

413
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:25,877
Oh, okay.

414
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,278
You'd need to speak
to the resident manager.

415
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:29,246
- Shall I call him?
- Sure.

416
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:33,952
You know, actually,
I just came in to say hi.

417
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,019
It's the manager
I'm looking for...

418
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,021
I have a job interview.

419
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,255
A friend set it up.

420
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:40,758
I have his name here
somewhere...

421
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,258
Floyd Mather.

422
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,194
Mr. Mather.
Right.

423
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,596
<i>Take those stairs</i>
<i>up to the mezzanine,</i>

424
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:48,198
then all the way around
and look for the signs.

425
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,566
Thank you so much.

426
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,901
<i>Concierge: Good luck!</i>

427
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,740
<i>Spike: Boss, James served two</i>
<i>30-day sentences last year--</i>

428
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,109
<i>Assault and violating</i>
<i>a restraining order.</i>

429
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,078
<i>Domestic offenses</i>
<i>go back four years,</i>

430
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:03,746
and he's been out of work
for over a year.

431
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,214
There's gonna be money issues.

432
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,548
I talked to Tobias.

433
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:07,917
Michelle and May
have moved three times

434
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,051
in the last year

435
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,552
and James keeps finding them,

436
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:12,154
<i>and every time he escalates.</i>

437
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:14,255
Parker: Dominating personality,
multiple stressors,

438
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:16,324
his life is out of control.

439
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:21,429
<i>He picks today to lash back</i>
<i>at the one person he can blame.</i>

440
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:23,231
And we know how these things
often go.

441
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:24,599
<i>Jules: Yeah, that's what</i>
<i>I'm afraid of.</i>

442
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,667
Murder-suicide.

443
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:31,772
(Heavy breathing)

444
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,711
I'm looking for the manager.

445
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:38,846
Can I help you?

446
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:41,515
Yes.
Where's Michelle Dalton?

447
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:47,319
May, we're gonna do
everything we can

448
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:48,420
to keep your mom safe.

449
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:50,489
Ed:
This is what we do, May.

450
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:51,958
Nobody needs to get hurt today.

451
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,594
Tell me your name again.

452
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:58,998
Greg Parker.

453
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:00,700
Greg.

454
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,433
Greg and Ed.

455
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:09,041
I wanna be able to hold you

456
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:10,976
to what you just
told to me, okay?

457
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:15,747
Okay, May.

458
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,050
Okay.

459
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:24,521
(Sirens wail)

460
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:29,426
<i>Ed: Let's go!</i>

461
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:30,527
Let's go!

462
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,369
Where is Michelle Dalton?!

463
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:41,871
(Staff screams)

464
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:43,006
Michelle!

465
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:44,207
Where is she?

466
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,443
Michelle!

467
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:48,544
Michelle:
James...

468
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,346
(Frightened whimpers)

469
00:18:56,524 --> 00:18:57,557
(Sirens wail)

470
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,263
Is that him?

471
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,597
Yeah.
That's definitely him.

472
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,867
Spike, we got a positive ID
on James.

473
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:09,069
<i>Concierge says he's looking</i>
<i>for the HR manager.</i>

474
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:10,337
Thank you, Heather.

475
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:11,704
Heather, where can I find
the manager?

476
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:12,872
Uh, mezzanine.
Up those stairs.

477
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,307
Thank you.
Spike, transponders on.

478
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:15,407
Let's move.

479
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:18,110
(Types furiously,
computer trills)

480
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:21,914
Up the stairs, left and left.

481
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:23,316
(Door bangs shut)
May's gonna help us profile.

482
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:24,383
No problem.

483
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,351
May? Spike.
Have a seat.

484
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:27,252
Thanks.

485
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,386
Okay?

486
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:33,892
(Whimpers, frightened)

487
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:41,199
This wasn't necessary,
Michelle?

488
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,667
You know that none of this
had to happen,

489
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:44,835
don't you?

490
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:48,605
<i>All you had to do</i>
<i>was talk to me.</i>

491
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,908
You know what day it is today.

492

underscore Tango, X-ray.
Thank you.

496
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,320
Those dots, is that your team?

497
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,222
Yep, and if my mom
was in trouble?

498
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,023
They're the ones I'd wanna see
coming through the window.

499
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,227
That's-that's inside.
How did you...?

500
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,096
It's magic.

501
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,731
Or hotel security
just gave you their access code

502
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,632
and wi-fi password.

503
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,768
She sees right though me.

504
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,637
Sir, the man who attacked you,
where did he go?

505
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:24,171
Michelle Dalton,
he went after her.

506
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,672
She was just in
the banquet kitchen.

507
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,408
- Banquet kitchen?
- The other side of the hotel,

508
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,076
through that door,
two flights down.

509
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,344
Sam:
Okay, go back to your office.

510
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:31,879
We'll get you help
as soon as we can.

511
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,447
Ed: Team one, James is headed
to the banquet kitchen.

<i>Spike: Copy that.</i>

<i>Boss, you're close.</i>
<i>Down the stairs to your right.</i>

514
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,352
Okay.
Here we go.

515
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,022
He's going to shoot her.

516
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:43,489
No, this is Team One
we're talking about May.

517
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:45,058
May: I need to hear.
Can we hear?

518
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:46,559
Spike: No. You know,
it can get a little bit intense--

519
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:49,095
Spike, I'm not a kid, okay?

520
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:50,496
<i>You said so yourself,</i>
<i>she'll be fine.</i>

521
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:52,933
Now am I here to help
or am I not?

522
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,200
Boss, okay if I patch May
into the conversation?

523
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:57,169
Parker: Okay, Spike,
but use your judgment.

524
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:58,370
<i>Spike: Copy that.</i>

525
00:20:58,438 --> 00:20:59,405
Okay, I'm gonna put it
on speaker.

526
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:00,306
You're gonna hear
the team's mics

527
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,373
and whatever we can pick up

528
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:03,442
from the kitchen
intercom system.

529
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,278
<i>James: I've been more than
reasonable with you.</i>

530

This is what happens

when you push a reasonable man
for too long!

532
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,619
No problem, James.
It's no problem.

533
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:17,088
<i>Put the gun away</i>

534
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,691
and you and I can have
a reasonable talk, okay?

535
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:22,994
All right.

536
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,664
Let's start with this...

537
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:30,968
Where is my daughter?

538
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,604
<i>Where is she?!</i>

539
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:36,206
Parker: Let's get the other
civilians out of the kitchen

540
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:37,674
and get him talking.

541
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,509
Jules: This man needs
to feel in control.

542
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,878
Parker: He's not a fan of
cops telling him what to do.

543
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,545
He doesn't like anyone
telling him what to do.

544
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:44,947
He has to be in charge.

545
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,282
Boss, you copy that?

546
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,450
Parker:
Yeah, Spike, I heard.

547
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:48,451
Raf:
Let's clear the room.

548
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:50,186
Jules:
Yeah.

549
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:51,454
Jules: Excuse me.

550
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:52,654
Raf: Sir, I need you
to leave right now.

551
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,226
I need you to leave now.

552
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,427
Jules: - Come on, let's go.
Raf: - Excuse me...

553
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:00,962
<i>Spike: Subject's standing twenty
feet from the banquet doors,</i>

554
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,097
facing away.

555
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:06,567
James:
(Muffled) How could you do this to me?!

556
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:07,869
<i>Michelle: James, I don't know
what you're talking about!</i>

557
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,104
James:
Don't lie to me!

558
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:10,872
Michelle:
I'm not!

559
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:12,073
<i>James: Don't stand there</i>
<i>and lie to my face!</i>

560
00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:13,408
<i>Don't try to turn this around!</i>

561
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:14,976
<i>You know damn well</i>
<i>this is your fault!</i>

562
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,210
<i>Michelle: Please put the gun down.</i>

563
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:18,212
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what you want me to say.</i>

564
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,447
<i>James: I want you to tell me</i>
<i>the truth!</i>

565
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:21,848
Parker:
James?

566
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,250
My name is Greg Parker.

567
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:26,020
I'd like to talk to you
if that's all right?

568
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,422
This is no one else's business.

569
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,557
I appreciate that,
but what I'd like to do--

570
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,924
James:
Who the hell are you?

571
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:33,226
My name is Greg, like I said,

572
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,361
I'm a professional negotiator.

573
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:36,695
<i>What I'd like to do here</i>

574
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:39,065
<i>is maybe help facilitate</i>
<i>a dialogue.</i>

575
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:42,568
<i>James: A conversation is</i>
<i>what I am trying to do here!</i>

576
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:45,838
I don't need
a professional negotiator

577
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,841
to have a conversation
with my own ex-wife,

578
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,308
for godsake!

579
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:51,677
<i>All right?</i>

580
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,913
What I need is
a little privacy.

581
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,948
Parker: Okay, that's great.
Let's do that.

582
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:57,416
I mean, you're in charge here.

583
00:22:57,483 --> 00:22:58,851
Why don't you just tell
the other people in the room

584
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,253
that it's time for them to go.

585
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:04,422
<i>James: I just wanna talk</i>
<i>to my wife!</i>

586
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:05,990
<i>Parker: I hear you, James.</i>

587
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:07,725
Ed, what's your status?

588
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,427
<i>Ed: Seconds away.</i>

589
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:12,163
<i>Parker: It'd be easier</i>
<i>to have that conversation...</i>

590
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,698
In position.

591
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:14,832
<i>Parker: You're calling</i>
<i>the shots here.</i>

592
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,934
<i>They'll do whatever you say.</i>

593
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,035
<i>Just ask them to leave.</i>

594
00:23:17,102 --> 00:23:18,703
Sam:
In position.

595
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:20,370
<i>Parker: You want privacy?</i>
<i>That's reasonable.</i>

596
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:21,504
<i>You want them to go?</i>
<i>That's fair.</i>

597
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:22,739
Just tell them.

598
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:27,544
James: Okay, okay.
Get out of here!

599
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,279
Everyone get out!

600
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:30,681
Except for you.

601
00:23:30,748 --> 00:23:31,782
Get out now!

602
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:34,952
<i>Get out!</i>

603
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,686
Thank you, James,
that's a good choice.

604
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:39,521
I said, get outta here, now!

605
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,957
Keith:
I'm not going anywhere.

606
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:42,792
You've got something to say,
you can say it now.

607
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,693
No.

608
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,727
What's wrong?

609
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:46,528
Hold it!

610
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,764
You hold it right there!

611
00:23:48,832 --> 00:23:52,634
That's Keith;
that's my mother's boyfriend.

612
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,336
You're him, aren't you?

613
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,906
- James.
- He is, isn't he?

614
00:23:57,974 --> 00:23:59,908
You're the workplace boyfriend.

615
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:01,542
(To himself) Oh boy...

616
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:05,513
<i>James: Congratulations.</i>
<i>How is it?</i>

617
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:07,015
<i>Keith: W-w-what're you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

618
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,115
My ex-wife.

619
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:11,251
How is it?

620
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:14,488
It's my fault.

621
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,690
Last time I talked to him,
I was just trying to help.

622
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:18,225
You mentioned your mother
was seeing someone?

623
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,661
I just said we have to stop
dwelling on the past,

624
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,195
on grudges,
and we have to move on...

625
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:23,196
and then I mentioned Keith.

626
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:24,463
Oh my God!

627
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,065
May! You didn't make
this happen.

628
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,266
Parker: Hey, James, why don't we just
stay on track--

629
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:28,968
James:
I am talking here!

630
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:31,370
Don't you take another step!

631
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,107
Keith: Look, if it's me
you got a problem with--

632
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,942
You back off!

633
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,110
Parker: James, you wanna have
a conversation with Michelle,

634
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:38,344
<i>let's just do that!</i>

635
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:41,079
Let me give you
a friendly warning...

636
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,781
You watch your back.

637
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,517
Michelle: I'm serious, James,
this is between you and me--

638
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:45,351
James: (Voice rising) Watch your
bank account, watch your wallet,

639
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:46,785
watch your goddamn dog!

640
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:47,853
<i>(Screaming) Because this woman,</i>

641
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,555
she will take everything
from you!

642
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,157
(Fire alarm rings)

643
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:57,328
You make 'em stop that!
You shut it off!

644
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,964
Parker:
Yup.

645
00:24:59,032 --> 00:24:59,531
<i>James: Get 'em to turn it off</i>
<i>right now!</i>

646
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,701
James?

647
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,171
Let's you and I just go
and talk. Just...

648
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,039
No problem.

649
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,640
Just the two of us.

650
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:10,942
I know the best way...

651
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,544
way out of here, okay?

652
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,145
(Fire alarm rings)

653
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,153
Okay.

654
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,921
<i>Okay.</i>

655
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,756
I want nice and slow.

656
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,358
Let's go.

657
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,292
<i>Ed: New deal.</i>
<i>Subject's preparing to exit.</i>

658
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,660
Raf, Jules, go around,

659
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,128
<i>isolate Michelle,</i>
<i>and cut him off.</i>

660
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:34,530
Jules: - Copy that.
Raf: - Copy.

661
00:25:37,234 --> 00:25:38,868
(Running footsteps)

662
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:41,404
May:
Wait. W-w-what's he doing?

663
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:42,538
Spike:
Ed?!

664
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:45,941
(Trolley rattles
and slams into James)

665
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,009
(James screams)

666
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:49,511
(Hot oil ignites and roars)

667
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:51,379
<i>Ed: Get down!</i>

668
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:54,282
Sam: - Clear the room!
Ed: - No shot! Get down!

669
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,919
Ed: James Mitchell! Right there!

670
00:25:58,188 --> 00:25:59,354
James Mitchell!

671
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:02,190
They're in the elevator.

672
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:03,657
We lost 'em!
They're gone!

673
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:04,759
Mom!

674
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:12,530
<i>Sam: Units have taken care</i>
<i>of the evac,</i>

675
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:13,965
getting the fire under control.

676
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,399
Ed: Spike, the subject
and his hostage

677
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:16,968
have taken
the service elevator.

678
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,268
<i>Spike: I know, and I'm on it.</i>

679
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:19,036
The elevator they took
is the only one

680
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:20,436
with rooftop access.

681
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:21,938
Raf: - You got control?
<i>Spike: - I do.</i>

682
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:23,039
We get him to the roof,
it's contained,

683
00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:24,273
we keep him away
from civilians.

684
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:25,542
Okay, good. Nice.

685
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,843
Is there a security camera
in there too?

686
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,478
That's just where I was going.

687
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,213
And we also gotta have a phone
that we can hear through.

688
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,815
(Typing furiously)

689
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:34,718
What if he gets out
at the lobby

690
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:36,151
and makes a run for it?

691
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,953
I've got full override
and they go where I say.

692
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:39,588
Guys, I'm gonna send down
another elevator.

693
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:40,723
<i>It doesn't go to the roof</i>

694
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,290
but I can get you through
a window.

695
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:43,759
<i>Ed: Spike, get the uniforms</i>
<i>to the stairs</i>

696
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:44,894
with Remmy's for me and Sam.

697
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:46,662
Copy that.

698
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,030
Sam: 'Kay, there's vents for cover.
You take the low one;

699
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:49,398
I'll get a higher vantage
from the 18th floor.

700
00:26:49,465 --> 00:26:51,033
Ed:
Let's move.

701
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,834
Parker: There's still a
chance we can talk him down.

702
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:53,902
Jules if he wanted to kill Michelle,
he already would've done it.

703
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:56,203
There's something else
he wants.

704
00:26:57,172 --> 00:26:58,540
(Elevator whirs)

705
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,310
James:
(Stressed, breathless)

706
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:07,781
<i>Come on, come on, come on...</i>

707
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,215
<i>Jules: Okay, let's break it down.</i>

708
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,084
This is a guy
who's lost everything.

709
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:12,753
<i>I think what he's fighting for</i>
<i>is a situation</i>

710
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,453
<i>where he's back</i>
<i>in control again.</i>

711
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,321
Even if it's the last thing
he controls.

712
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:17,389
<i>Spike: This might not be</i>
<i>a dead end.</i>

713
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:18,858
He's got May.

714
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,292
It's me he wants.

715
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,761
<i>He doesn't believe</i>
<i>I don't like him.</i>

716
00:27:21,828 --> 00:27:23,796
He wants me, not her.

717
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:25,364
<i>Spike: She's the one thing standing</i>
<i>between him and giving up.</i>

718
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:27,667
She is the light
at the end of his tunnel.

719
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:29,968
The talk's gotta be about her.

720
00:27:30,036 --> 00:27:31,436
(Elevator whirs)

721
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:36,374
What the hell...?

722
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:38,043
(Stabs lobby button repeatedly)

723
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,477
<i>What the hell?</i>

724
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:41,279
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

725
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:42,714
<i>Michelle: Someone else must've
called the elevator.</i>

726
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:44,382
James: I realize
that, bright-eyes!

727
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,783
It still should've stopped
at the lobby

728
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,384
on the way up!

729
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:48,619
(Stabbing button repeatedly)
James, just calm down.

730
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:50,654
We're gonna get there
one way or another.

731
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:52,623
<i>Stay calm, okay?</i>

732
00:27:54,158 --> 00:27:55,192
(Whimpers)

733
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:02,131
The most... precious thing
in the world to me...

734
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:06,102
and you took her from me!

735
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:08,738
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

736
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:10,807
Jules: He thinks cops
are messing with him.

737
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,108
<i>If we want his attention,</i>

738
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:14,010
he's more likely to listen
to the daughter.

739
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:16,012
Use May as a TPI?

740
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,346
Third Party Intermediary;

741
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:19,481
a civilian involved
in negotiations.

742
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,049
Raf: It gives him a reason
to look to the future.

743
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:22,550
She's just a teenager.

744
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,219
Why would you do that to me?!

745
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,254
James...

746
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:28,256
(Screaming) Why?!

747
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:31,392
- Aggghhhhh!
- You're not getting away with it anymore!

748
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,393
<i>Michelle: (Terrified)</i>
<i>James, please!</i>

749
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,528
Spike, turn the speaker off.

750
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:35,863
(James' screaming voice
suddenly cuts out)

751
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,732
What're you doing?

752
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,833
<i>Why are you turning it off?</i>

753
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,300
I'm sorry.

754
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:41,636
Guys, this could be
emotionally traumatic.

755
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,004
Do we wanna put her
through that?

756
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:44,005
I'll do it!
He'll listen to me.

757
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,272
Usually, we try not--

758
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,407
I'm eighteen, okay?
I can make this choice.

759
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,709
<i>Please, let me help my mom,</i>

760
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:50,644
or this will never be over.

761
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:52,779
Boss, she is old enough
to know what she's doing.

762
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:53,680
<i>Spike: Raf's right;</i>
<i>May's not a kid.</i>

763
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:54,881
She's pretty together.

764
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,916
Let me talk to him.

765
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:58,818
(Opens comm link) Go ahead.

766
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:02,421
(Into mic) Greg, I won't even talk
to him if you don't want me to,

767
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,991
<i>but if he sees me up there,</i>
<i>watching...</i>

768
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:07,492
He cares a lot more
about my respect

769
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,494
than he does yours.

770
00:29:09,562 --> 00:29:13,165
(Elevator dings open,
Michelle whimpers)

771
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,034
Subject's on the roof.

772
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,368
(Michelle cries out,
struggling)

773
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,970
James: (Pounds the lobby button)
Come on!

774
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:20,539
(Michelle yelps in pain) Come!

775
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:25,143
Come on! Come on!

776
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,046
<i>Parker: May, we can't control</i>
<i>what your father might do.</i>

777
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:29,213
<i>Ed: You got me and Sam</i>
<i>on Sierra.</i>

778
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:31,482
There's no way
we'll let James harm her.

779
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,650
<i>Jules: It's worth a try.</i>

780
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:34,118
He's heading into an endgame...

781
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:35,553
If he feels that he can
revive his relationship

782
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,321
with his daughter...

783
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,656
Sam: Even if it's from jail,
it's something to hope for.

784
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:41,591
It'll feel more within reach
if he can see her.

785
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:48,165
All right, May.

786
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:50,266
But you have to follow
our instructions

787
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:51,702
and stick to the script.

788
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:53,036
Promise.

789
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:54,236
Parker:
Spike, bring her to the roof.

790
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,805
Spike: Copy that.
Let's go, bella.

791
00:29:57,407 --> 00:29:59,175
(Hard punch,
Michelle cries out)

792
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:00,342
Aggghhhh!

793
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:05,581
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Sam, you got eyes?</i>

794
00:30:07,684 --> 00:30:09,384
Sam: In position. I see 'im.

795
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:10,852
<i>James: You know it's over, right?</i>

796
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,387
Everything changes today.

797
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:14,923
<i>Michelle: What changes?</i>

798
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,825
<i>James: This game you play,</i>
<i>this power game,</i>

799
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:20,028
<i>where your attorney</i>
<i>sucks my account dry,</i>

800
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:22,230
where you sabotage
my reputation,

801
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:25,766
<i>where you play hide and seek</i>
<i>all over the damn city,</i>

802
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,267
<i>and your favorite part--</i>

803
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,635
<i>where you write down the rules</i>

804
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:30,838
<i>about when I can see</i>
<i>my own daughter.</i>

805
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:33,573
- I'm not to blame!
- Did you say something?

806
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:35,242
<i>Spike: We're almost there, guys.</i>

807
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:37,211
<i>James: My little girl is eighteen,</i>
<i>for Christ sake!</i>

808
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:38,979
<i>I just wanna hear her voice.</i>

809
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,114
I call her

810
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:41,848
and none of my messages
get through.

811
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:43,916
So, I'm sorry,
but I gotta wonder why.

812
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:46,185
You have her cell phone number?

813
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:47,486
<i>James: You made me do it!</i>

814
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,421
<i>I had to track you down</i>
<i>and ask you,</i>

815
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:51,924
where the hell is May?!

816
00:30:51,992 --> 00:30:52,925
(Door bursts open)

817
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:54,460
Jules:
Come on.

818
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,428
All right, listen to me.
I want you to talk about hope,

819
00:30:56,496 --> 00:30:58,263
I want you to talk
about the future.

820
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,497
Look at me.

821
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:01,466
I need you to stay positive,
all right?

822
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:02,634
That's all you need to do.

823
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:04,169
We're gonna be
right there with you,

824
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,203
<i>okay?</i>

825
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:06,204
Okay.

826
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:07,538
Okay. Let's do it.

827
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,644
<i>Michelle: If she's not returning</i>
<i>your calls,</i>

828
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:14,044
she's choosing not to.

829
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:15,545
- You have to accept that.
- No! You're a liar!

830
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,081
May:
Daddy?!

831
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:21,051
May!

832
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,988
I'm right here, okay?
I'm right here.

833
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:33,263
James: (Hisses)
Look what you've done!

834
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,531
(Rages) Look what you've done!

835
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,966
<i>The cops, again!</i>

836
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:38,467
You bitch!

837
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:41,137
I need you to get him to focus
on the two of you.

838
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:42,371
All right. Okay.

839
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:43,239
Please, dad,
just let her go, okay?

840
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:44,573
It'll just be you and me

841
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,676
and we can talk
as much as you want.

842
00:31:46,743 --> 00:31:49,412
(Raging) I have survived,
I have pulled through,

843
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,780
<i>and every time</i>
<i>I think I'm close,</i>

844
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:52,682
you do it again!

845
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:55,484
<i>May: Dad, I wanna hear</i>
<i>what you're feeling, okay?</i>

846
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:56,819
Why don't you tell me!

847
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,621
James: When will it be enough?!
When?!

848
00:31:58,689 --> 00:31:59,689
Tell me!

849
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:00,790
Ed?

850
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:02,557
Weapon's not in play.

851
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:03,792
<i>James: What do you want?!</i>
<i>You want me to give up?!</i>

852
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,360
What're you doing?!
You have to stop it!

853
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:07,028
May, when we shoot,
we shoot to kill.

854
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:08,296
It's a last resort.

855
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:09,798
Can't you just shoot him
in the leg,

856
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:11,433
or do something?

857
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,234
It's too risky.
He could fire by reflex.

858
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:14,869
Don't give up on words.

859
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:16,204
<i>James: Do you want me to die,</i>
<i>Michelle?</i>

860
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,539
Would that make you happy?

861
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:19,506
Would that work for you?

862
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:20,841
Sierra two, stand by.
On my go.

863
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:22,543
Copy.

864
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,644
Michelle: (Sobbing)

865
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,217
Don't you dare!

866
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:31,352
May!

867
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,421
Boss?

868
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:37,489
May's got a weapon.
She's got a weapon.

869
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:45,213
May:
Don't you dare!

870
00:32:45,281 --> 00:32:47,547
Jules:
May, drop your weapon!

871
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,116
Parker:
Hold fire!

872
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,089
May: Leave her alone!
This ends now!

873
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,556
Parker:
Okay, she's crossed the line.

874
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:00,127
I've got...
I've got May.

875
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:01,528
I have James!

876
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:04,097
Jules: May, drop your weapon now!

877
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:05,664
Michelle:
May, baby, no!

878
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:07,533
<i>Parker: - May, don't do it!</i>

in the last two minutes

920
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,952
before scorpio command,

921
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,854
there were numerous voices,
raised voices,

922
00:35:51,922 --> 00:35:53,456
shouted instructions.

(In a low, menacing voice)
We had complete control.

926
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:04,200
What you heard
was communication

927
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:05,633
between members of my team.

928
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,769
The raised voices were
our instructions

929
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:10,338
to May Dalton, we were...

930
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:13,241
trying to avoid
the use of lethal force.

931
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:16,678
There were... two gunshots
before scorpio call.

932
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:17,946
Yes.

933
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,681
You allowed her to fire
before scorpio call.

934
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:21,415
She raised her weapon,

935
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,649
her grip was unsteady--

936
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:24,452
You allowed her to fire twice.

937
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,686
Isn't that a breach
of protocol?

938
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,521
You heard the audio.

939
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:30,291
We were trying
to get her to stop.

940
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:31,392
Noted.

941
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:34,661
Your sergeant, Greg Parker,
states...

942
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:36,397
She was in the "tunnel."

943
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:37,964
She steadied her right hand
with her left,

944
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,833
and prepared to fire
a third time.

945
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:45,738
She crossed the line,
I took the shot.

946
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,440
After your sergeant's
scorpio command?

947
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,008
At the same time.

948
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:50,810
And are you convinced that
all options were exhausted

949
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,512
before the use of lethal force?

950
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:58,350
(Threatening tone)
What did I just say?

951
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:00,051
Kowalski:
Well, thank you for your time.

952
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,886

beside me in the truck,

954
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:09,193
how could I not have known?

955
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,528
Jules:
Spike, what,

956
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,563
are we supposed to frisk
all our witnesses?

957
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,698
Sam: Okay, May said she and her mom
never felt safe, right?

958
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,267
That the cops couldn't
protect them?

959
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,335
Spike: That he could track
them down anywhere.

960
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,170
I remember that.

961
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,071
Parker: "Tobias has done everything
so that we can feel safe."

962
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,340
Come on, from that,
we're supposed to know

963
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,342
that Tobias procured her
an illegal gun,

964
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,276
<i>which she kept with her</i>
<i>at all times, just in case?</i>

965
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,577
Parker: She should never
have been on that roof;

966
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,846
that was my fault.

967
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,647
<i>Spike: Boss, don't go there.</i>

968
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,848
We all signed off on it.

969
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,582
<i>Sam: It was a judgment call.</i>

970
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,051
<i>Spike: She insisted--</i>
<i>you all heard that, right?</i>

971
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,719
She said, "let me go up there,
let me talk to him."

972
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,487
Parker: That's irrelevant; She
was emotionally involved.

973
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,722
<i>That wasn't her choice to make.</i>

974
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,524
We made that choice.

975
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,958
Spike: She knew when she said it
that she had a loaded weapon.

976
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,960
I'm just saying.

977
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,628
Sam: All right, bean bag rounds.
Raf and Spike,

978
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,964
if we sent you from here
and here, and we timed it--

979
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,266
Sam, we don't take that risk,

980
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,834
not when the subject
has a weapon

981
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,569
inches from the victim!

982
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:55,638
Sam: I know, but what I'm saying
is we missed an opportunity

983
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,739
when he was distracted
by May coming towards--

984
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,941
Jules: I was the one
who let her run.

985
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:01,743
<i>(Emotions rising)</i>
<i>I had her, hand on shoulder.</i>

986
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:03,478
She was safe.

987
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:04,680
<i>And next thing I know</i>

988
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:06,114
she's running into
the line of fire.

989
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:08,984
Ed: All right, stop!
Just stop.

990
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:13,588
We did nothing wrong.
We followed protocol.

991
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:18,193
An eighteen-year-old girl's dead

992
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,795
and there's nothing right
about that.

993
00:38:20,862 --> 00:38:22,430
<i>She was a brave girl.</i>

994
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:24,566
She deserved to live,

995
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:27,468
and it is a tragedy
that she's gone.

996
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:28,503
<i>But she knew</i>
<i>what she was doing;</i>

997
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:30,171
<i>she was armed.</i>

998
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:32,005
She was an active shooter,

999
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:33,840
and we have a code,
we have rules,

1000
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:37,110
<i>so that when</i>
<i>we are under pressure</i>

1001
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:41,248
we function as a team
and we know what to do.

1002
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:44,451
This one time,
we could've made an exception.

1003
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,452
We could've taken the risk.

1004
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,719
We could've shot to wound.

1005
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:48,621

Raf, that's a slippery slope.

1006

<i>I just do us all a favor</i>

all thinking.

1008
00:38:52,158 --> 00:38:54,627

and...

1009
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:57,830
let her kill him.

1010
00:38:57,897 --> 00:38:59,532
(The team's silent)

1011
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:06,471

1012
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:08,106
<i>No, we couldn't.</i>

1013
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,375
Because that's not
how it works.

1014
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:12,644
We are not judges, we are cops.

1015
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:15,213
We're cops and we all-
all of us--

1016
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:16,481
have to be on the same page.

1017
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:18,049
Parker:
Okay, let's all sit down.

1018

I get that's the job--

1019
00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:21,151
No, no, no!
We don't get to wing it.

1020
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:23,019
We don't get to choose
which rules we're gonna follow;

1021
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:24,087
<i>that's what the bad guys do.</i>

1022
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:27,658
What we do...
we serve the law.

1023
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:32,195

<i>but...</i>

1032
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,420

<i>Raf: I know, I get that, boss.</i>

1037
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:10,765

1038
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,368

1039
00:40:16,806 --> 00:40:18,639
