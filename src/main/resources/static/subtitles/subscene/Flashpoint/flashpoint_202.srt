1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,962
If you want to get out of here alive,

2
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:15,763
then you're going to tell
me what happened in New York.

3
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:20,302
Spike,what's going on? I need
eyes in.Get up there with Jules.

4
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:22,893
What do you want me to say?

5
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:26,319
I will know the truth when I hear it.

6
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:29,178
Alpha One and Two,requesting
permission to enter,sir.

7
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:32,000
We go through the skylight, we'll
spook her. She might use the knife.

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,407
What have I done?What have I done?

9
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:38,353
Boss,I can see this. You're not
seeing it. Sam's not seeing it.

10
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,224
I can see it. We can be in
there within three seconds.

11
00:00:40,234 --> 00:00:43,573
We'll disarm her. The knife is
down. Repeat: the knife is down.

12
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,857
We got to go in,boss. We got to risk it.

13
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,120
- They are escalating.
- Go,go,go,go!

14
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:55,147
Do you see anything?

15
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:57,949
3 hours earlier

16
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,640
Just give me another minute here

17
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:04,398
the fearless explorer probing the
uncharted depths in search for life

18
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:09,494
we know it's a little early but,
when we got the test back, the results

19
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,125
She couldn't wait

20
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:13,006
Just couldn't wait

21
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:14,935
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:21,787
No,no but the test was positive

23
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:23,130
Maybe we misread the results

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,850
No we didn't misread the results, there were
2 very clear blue lines, it was positive

25
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,662
Must have been false positive,
it happens.

26
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:35,999
Maybe you just can't see anything
because it's just too early

27
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:41,767
No, if there been a pregnancy,
if would have seen it.

28
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:44,617
I'm very sorry

29
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:50,692
Look, why don't you get cleaned up
I'll be back in a minute and we'll talk

30
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,830
- It's ok, just schedule something now,
- No.No.

31
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:57,361
- So we dont get too down about it
- No.Sarah,

32
00:01:57,371 --> 00:02:01,296
We just book another appointment for
one last treatment next month,ok?

33
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:04,463
Sara, it's been 4 months of clomad

34
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:08,963
9 IVF procedures over the last 3,5 years

35
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:11,833
And all that time there's only been one fertilization

36
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:16,180
But it took, I was pregnant for four months

37
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:22,053
Yes, and the loss was a shock to your body

38
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:28,704
Last month, we sat
here in this same spot,

39
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:32,571
and I told you that your
chances were very,very slim,

40
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:36,937
and that I did not think that you
should go forward with another treatment.

41
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:40,507
I'm sorry to be so blunt,
but in good conscience,

42
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:45,267
I can't recommend that
you spend another $15,000.

43
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,186
Okay,all clear.

44
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:55,775
Not that I don't appreciate a little
excitement, but come on,I think we're safe.

45
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:59,374
You mind if I don't gamble
my career on what you think?

46
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:01,744
Unless one of your neighbors works
for the SRU, it's not much of a gamble.

47
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,836
Now,headquarters, that's another story.

48
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:05,190
I trust you have an entry plan.

49
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,013
Affirmative. I'm gonna drop
you off a few blocks away,

50
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:09,902
park my vehicle at HQ,
enter through the front.

51
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:13,126
You're gonna wait a few minutes,
stealth through the rear.

52
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:16,149
- I was kidding.
- Yeah,I'm not.

53
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,128
Sarah,when you get home, can you see
if I left my phone on the counter?

54
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,623
We're not giving up,right? We're not...

55
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:27,847
Oh,for God's sake,Sarah,we...

56
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,862
- we're not doing it again.
- Why?

57
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:31,235
We're not doing it again. I'm sorry.

58
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,701
I-I can't get back on
this roller coaster.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,532
I can't keep feeling like every month is
some sort of test that we have to pass...

60
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,499
You know that's not true.

61
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:40,591
What else do you want to throw away,hmm?

62
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,505
I mean,what else gets thrown out the window
just in case maybe this time we're lucky.

63
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,146
What are you talking about,Josh?

64
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:49,670
Everything that we save, sweetheart.

65
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:52,625
Everything,everything that we hoped for.

66
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:56,234
You're the one giving up on our hope.

67
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:01,742
You threw away your work...

68
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:02,990
which you were damn good at.

69
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:05,370
And we agreed. We made
that decision together.

70
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,346
- Okay.
- We agreed that that was the right thing to do.

71
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:09,669
Because you wanted to relax.

72
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:15,436
You wanted to relax and read catalogs and dream
of babies in a house that we can't pay for anymore.

73
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:17,864
I never said I wanted that
house. I don't need a big house.

74
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:21,338
We'll move. We'll get a smaller house.

75
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,382
All our friends who have babies
you don't want to see anymore.

76
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,332
That's not true.

77
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:28,286
You can't go outside because you're scared
you're gonna see another frickin' stroller.

78
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:32,163
I went outside yesterday.

79
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:37,825
- Y-You went outside
yesterday? - Yes.

80
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,030
I've held your hand...

81
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,332
I've stayed up with you at
night. I've dreamed with you.

82
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:46,942
I've given up a lot that I care about.

83
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:51,423
I mean,I've done... everything
that I can do, but I-I...

84
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,107
I-I can't do this anymore.

85
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:58,630
You can't do what?

86
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,008
You know what? I-I should... I'm
gonna go to work. I have to go to work.

87
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,784
- What are you saying?
- I have to go.

88
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:05,242
- Josh!
- Sarah.

89
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:08,736
Josh! G... Josh.

90
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:13,313
What are you saying?

91
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:19,378
I told her,line dry only.
She keeps putting my pants in the dryer.

92
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:21,768
Hold up. Hold up. Your mom
still does your laundry?

93
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:25,395
Hey,she's Italian,okay?
Try and stop her.

94
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:26,432
Gentlemen.

95
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,322
Missed you at choir
practice last night,man.

96
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:31,019
That's another round you owe
the boys. Don't let that add up.

97
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:34,742
You know what? I lay down for 20 minutes,
I opened my eyes, suddenly it was 6:00 a.m.

98
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,201
I hate when that happens.

99
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,590
Samtastic sleeping alone.

100
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,644
What's this world coming to?

101
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,976
Ed,we patrolling today?

102
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:45,730
All right,listen up. The El
Colera gang has three strongholds.

103
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,321
We are gonna split up and cover 'em all.

104
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:51,315
Boss wants us out in
five, so let's go,ladies.

105
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,415
Oh,he's not home! He's not home!

106
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,104
AM COMING UP SOON. WILL TXT
WHN I GT THERE. HANNAH.

107
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:02,618
Oh,no. No.

108
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:06,965

112
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,490
So,you want to cook tonight?
Try your new barbecue?

113
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,754
Relax. We're off.

114
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,672
- How did it go with the guys this morning?
- Fine. Don't worry.

115
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,121
Anyway,who cares whate do?

116
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,748
Uh,the sarge,the chief,
the commander. The rules.

117
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:56,848
- All right,but the thing is...
- Yeah,yeah,yeah.

118
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,671
It's nobody's business.
We're professionals.

119
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,387
Absolutely. You are
utterly professional.

120
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,084
Me,I'm just here for
the sexy sniper chicks.

121
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,103
You doing okay?

122
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:12,030
Yeah. Yeah,I'm good. I'm good.

123
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,112
'Cause,uh,the other
day at the station...

124
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:15,878
Oh,come on. Here we go.

125
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,985
- What?
- Look,I'm just saying.

126
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:22,538
You look through the scope, and
you see things that aren't there.

127
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,265
Maybe you need a break from the action.

128
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:25,532
When was the last
time you had a day off?

129
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:26,876
I don't need a day off.

130
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:29,841
Hey,we could all use a day off,Ed.

131
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,987
All right, thanks,Oprah. I forgot
what a joy it was to ride with you.

132
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:51,788
Hello.

133
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:55,492
- Mrs. Scott?
- You must be Hannah.

134
00:08:55,502 --> 00:09:00,387
I'm,um... I write for... Wired
Magazine. I'm here to see Joshua?

135
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:02,949
Of course. Come in.

136
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:12,478
- If this is a-a bad time,I
could... - No. No,it's a good time.

137
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:15,089
Please,come in. Sit down.

138
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:18,044
You have a lovely home.

139
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,895
Thank you.

140
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,086
Would you,uh... Would you like some tea?

141
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,783
Sure. Thank you.

142
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:43,926
He's,um... He's at work a-actually.

143
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:48,053
I'm sorry. I thought he was here.

144
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:51,076
I-I wanted to talk to you.

145
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:54,732
I'm s... Youtexted me?

146
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,870
I want to know about you and-and him.

147
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,641
How do you mean?

148
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:10,250
I think you know what I mean.

149
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:15,307
Do you know what? I'm gonna go. I'm
sorry that I... that I bothered you.

150
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,773
- Please don't.
- Excuse me.

151
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,290
- I-I have
to... - Don't go.

152
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:22,322
- You let me go!
- Not until you tell me the truth.

153
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:27,188
Look,I just... I just
want... I just want the truth.

154
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:28,253
Okay.

155
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:31,093
So you stay until we talk. Okay?

156
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:34,999
All right. Okay,we can talk.

157
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,784
- I'm calling the police!
- Don't. No,don't!

158
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:39,126
Put it down! Just stay...
Just stay away from me.

159
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:40,229
No. No,don't do that.

160
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,331
- Oh,my God. Help me.
- Put that down!

00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:20,659
We're real close. Boss?

167
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:22,425
Kira,what did 54 Division give us?

168
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:25,131
911 came in ten minutes
ago. Dispatch flagged it.

169
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,607
There's been a wave of violent
home invasions in the neighborhood.

170
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,653
Underground Boys?

171
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:29,978
Same grid. Copy that.

172
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:31,302
Underground Boys?

173
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:34,661
Four in the last two weeks, and all
four came through the basement windows.

174
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,096
Last week,they found some woman at
home,tied her up and robbed the place.

175
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,697
Kira,play the 911,would ya?

176
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:41,887
Here it comes.

177
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:46,647
Oh,my God! Help me,please!
Help me,please! Help!

178
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:47,607
Put that down!

179
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:48,998
How far are you guys?

180
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,092
Three minutes.

181
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:53,038
Okay,don't approach without
cover. They could be expecting us.

182
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:56,455
Get some intel. Hold off on
entry until we go in as a team.

183
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:58,393
Got it.

184
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,709
No signs of forced entry
on black or white wall.

185
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:20,619
Okay. No broken basement windows?

186
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:21,761
That's a negative.

187
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,824
Maybe the Underground
Boys are trying a new MO.

188
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,252
Could be something else. Who knows?

189
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:29,851
Sarah and Josh Scott. She's an
illustrator. Works from home.

190
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,789
He runs a software design company.

191
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,271
Neighbor saw them leave together early this
morning, but she returned home alone around 9:15.

192
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,324
That doesn't sound
like a domestic,does it?

193
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:42,643
Unless the guy came back and walked in on the
wife doing something she didn't want him to see.

194
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:45,215
Or she opened the door
to the intruders herself.

195
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:46,693
Sam,let's move forward on this.

196
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,756
Make contact,but go careful.

197
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:49,859
Yes,sir.

198
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,788
Jules,I'm dialing in.

199
00:12:55,924 --> 00:12:58,602
Kira,can you patch me through
to the source of the 911?

200
00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:05,012
Come on.

201
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:10,175
This is Sam Braddock from the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

202
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:15,098
We're here to resolve the situation, but
we can't help unless you pick up the phone.

203
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,630
We got movement on white Alpha Two.

204
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,019
Throw phone?

205
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:23,562
Okay,team, it's not a domestic.

206
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:25,712
The husband was at work,
and he's on his way.

207
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,622
Boss,we're thinking about a throw phone.

208
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,128
If they pick it up, it
will limit their movements.

209
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:32,007
If they don't,we'll have
the open mike on our side.

210
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,121
All right,copy that.

211
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,153
Here's something weird. I just
talked to the alarm company.

212
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:40,529
The alarm hasn't been triggered today,
and it was armed a few minutes ago.

213
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:43,552
So,what,the intruders come in
and then she sets the alarm?

214
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:44,454
How does that work?

215
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:48,293
If someone's pointing a gun at you and they
tell you to punch in the code,you'd do it.

216
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:50,740
How far are we?

217
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,726
Two minutes out.

218
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,419
Please step away from your window.

219
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:08,887
We are throwing a phone into the house.

220
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:11,622
The window's going to break.

221
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,170
What the hell was that?

222
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:29,251
Please,please answer!

223
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,285
- Please talk to them!
- Shut up!

224
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:33,109
Shut up! You don't get
to tell me what to do!

225
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:34,683
Don't tell me what to do!

226
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:38,041
This is Sam Braddock from the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

227
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:39,778
Get away from my house!

228
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:40,719
This is Sarah?

229
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:44,864
Get down and stay down! Stay down!

230
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,342
- Don't... don't move!
- Okay!

231
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:02,676
I just... I-I just want the truth!

232
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:06,217
- Sarah!
- Don't!

233
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,783
Sarah!

234
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:14,307
Just tell me the truth!

235
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:17,445
Sarge,we lost the ear. She threw
the phone out. It's escalating.

236
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:19,873
Okay,we have a hostage
situation with an unknown weapon.

237
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:21,360
Talk is number one.

238
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,999
But be ready with an immediate
action if the hostage is threatened.

239
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:26,878
Spike,you're less lethal.
Jules,you're Sierra One.

240
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,026
Let's set up the LADD. Number
one on white, number two on black.

241
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:31,504
At least we can keep listening.

242
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:33,001
Copy that.

243
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,409
Sam,I want you to say on the loudhailer.

244
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:37,089
Be persistent with no pressure.

245
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:38,116
You're not taking over?

246
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:40,006
- Negative.
- Copy that.

247
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:44,085
Sarah,I'd really like to know...

248
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:47,021
I don't know what you're talking about.

249
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:51,484
I need to make sure
everyone's okay in there,Sarah.

250
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,514
Ed,I'm gonna run tactics.

251
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:57,923
You and Lou run Command Post.

252
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,860
Wha... Command Post?

253
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,961
Oprah says.

254
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:05,907
Yes,sir.

255
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,719
Let's get a list of all the
license plates parked nearby.

256
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:20,283
- What?
- You... in the truck.

257
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:22,327
What can I tell you?

258
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:23,997
It's backwards day.

259
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:26,050
- Let me through. Get out of my way.
- Sir...

260
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,910
Get out of my way. My wife's
in there. Let me through.

261
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,762
Sarah! Let go of me!

262
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:34,582
Joshua Scott. Mr. Scott.

263
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,077
Thank you,Constable.

264
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,027
What are you doing?

265
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:39,351
We can't let you come any closer.

266
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,606
My wife is in there. She's
in danger. What are you doing?

267
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:44,073
Sir,we're not sure it was your
wife that placed the 911 call.

268
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:45,032
What do you mean?

269
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:48,362
We believe your wife is holding
someone in there against their will.

270
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:50,570
Sarah?

271
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:52,873
No,Sarah would never do that.

272
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,274
Sir,are there any firearms in the house?

273
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:55,877
No,there's no firearms in the house.

274
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:57,604
Stand back,sir,please.

275
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,389
Team,husband claims there
are no guns in the house.

276
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:01,798
We might be looking at a
knife, scissors, razor blade.

277
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:02,882
Look,she would just never do that.

278
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:05,771
- Sir,I can't have you do that. You need to step back.
- Okay,okay.

279
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,091
Now I need you to help me.

280
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:11,500
I need you to help me
with some answers,okay?

281
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,196
What can you tell me about
her state of mind this morning?

282
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:16,634
She was upset. We had
a fight,an argument.

283
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,879
Your wife isn there with an
unknown weapon and a hostage,

284
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:21,211
and we don't want to
make her more upset,okay?

285
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:24,042
I don't think it's a good idea if she
sees you through the window right now.

286
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:26,163
- Okay.
- You got to trust me on this. This is what we do.

287
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:27,305
Okay.

288
00:17:27,324 --> 00:17:31,345
Okay,I want you to come into the truck over
here. Talk to my guys, tell 'em what you know.

289
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:40,596
9:58AM Barricaded hostage situation,
Unknown weapon.

290
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,794
EUP Sarah Scott.

291
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,704
Unidentified hostage.

292
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:47,487
Sergeant Parker to direct tactical plan.

293
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,402
How you doing? I'm Ed Lane. Louis Young.

294
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,358
Have a seat, please,Josh.

295
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,024
You texted him twice this morning.

296
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,058
It's professional. I told you.

297
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:02,352
You're lying.

298
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:06,085
What about "Yesterday was amazing"?

299
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:16,603
Any movement?

300
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,992
No,but I definitely scared
them away from the windows.

301
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:20,480
A little aggressive,huh?

302
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,226
You're doing good.

303
00:18:29,884 --> 00:18:32,034
Okay.

304
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,076
Move as soon as we
got a position on 'em.

305
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,122
Copy.

306
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:42,283
Gordy,we got ears yet?

307
00:18:42,302 --> 00:18:44,337
Getting an audio signal.

308
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:47,264
- Please!
- Tell me the truth!

309
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,824
If we could just go outside,please?

310
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,194
You can just talk to your husband.

311
00:18:53,214 --> 00:18:55,229
Please,let me talk to my wife.

312
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:58,041
Josh,we can't right now. We can't.

313
00:18:58,444 --> 00:18:59,806
Spike's on Less Lethal.

314
00:18:59,826 --> 00:19:01,236
Boss gonna need you with the gas.

315
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:02,580
What do you mean,"lethal"?

316
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,614
Josh,Plan A is less lethal.

317
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,555
Less lethal?

318
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:06,917
Rubber bullets.

319
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,635
How can you be less dead?

320
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:10,708
We dislodge the weapon,
restrain the subject.

321
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,032
This is insane.

322
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:15,046
You have all this hardware for
an upset woman with maybe a knife.

323
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,255
Knife's as bad as a gun.

324
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:20,497
It never sticks,never jams, never runs out of ammo
and you don't need traing to know how to use it.

325
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:23,721
So just sit down and calm yourself.

326
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:29,671
Please,please, I'm so scared! Please?

327
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,843
I've got eyes. Female hostage.
Knife confirmed. Threat imminent.

328
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:37,703
- Spike,stand by.
- Copy.

329
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:40,688
On my go.

330
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:44,747
Please don't hurt me! I'm pregnant!

331
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:51,110
She's pregnant. Hostage is pregnant.

332
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,994
Stand down! Stand down. Stand
down. We got a pregnant hostage.

333
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,854
You...

334
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:01,781
you're having his baby?

335
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,950
No.

336
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:10,053
You're having his baby.

337
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:14,448
Your having his...

338
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:22,500
I knew it. I knew that there
was a reason that,that...

339
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,254
why he'd given up. It was you.

340
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:27,173
Please,you're not making sense.

341
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,064
You're coming with me.

342
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,828
- Please,you need to talk to someone.
- Get up!

343
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:35,590
Okay,team,new rules: No Taser,no
CS gas and no rubber bullets.

344
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,106
Not a lot of tools in the toolkit.

345
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,267
Gordy,we hear anything yet?

346
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:39,860
Yeah,it's not clear.

347
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:41,655
Please! Please!

348
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:43,747
Go up the stairs.

349
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:50,205
- They're wrestling.
- Spike?

350
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,038
I've lost them. I've lost visual.

351
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:57,902
Boss,let me send in
some gas, clear them out.

352
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:59,379
Negative. She's pregnant.

353
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,057
We got to go in,boss. We got to risk it.

354
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:06,903
No!

355
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,287
Enough!

356
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:19,734
Please watch out for the baby!

357
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,634
Enough!

358
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:27,277
Enough,enough. Enough. Enough.

359
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,290
Please,please don't hurt the baby.

360
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:34,954
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

361
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:38,754
Come on. Let's go. Upstairs.

362
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,673
I need to show you something.

363
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:42,785
So you have no idea who this woman is?

364
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:44,953
No.

365
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:47,074
Your wife thinks you're
having an affair with her,Josh.

366
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:50,068
I am,I am not having an affair.

367
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:52,813
You understand the risk
you're taking if you lie to me?

368
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:54,521
I love my wife.

369
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:57,256
We had a tough time, but I love my wife.

370
00:21:57,285 --> 00:22:01,008
I understand that, but what I don't
understand is who she has in that room with her

371
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:02,611
and why she has a knife to her throat.

372
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,914
Mr. Scott, we need you to draw
a floor plan of your house.

373
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:06,191
Both floors,Josh.

374
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,830
Every door-- which way
it opens and every window.

375
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,739
- Okay.
- Thank you.

376
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,083
Eddie,Eddie,what's he saying?

377
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:13,455
That he's not involved with anyone.

378
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:15,595
- You believe him?
- No.

379
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,802
Okay,she says she wants
the truth,and so do I.

380
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:20,298
He was saying they were having a fight
this morning, talking about having a baby.

381
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:23,340
Let's see how that escalated before
this knife starts swinging again.

382
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,211
Lou,I want you to patch
me in on this conversation.

383
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,497
I want Sam and I to hear it.

384
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:28,474
Copy that.

385
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:30,153
Sarah,it's Sam.

386
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:33,195
I'm trying to phone
again. Please pick up.

387
00:22:46,794 --> 00:22:49,126
Did he tell you about this?

388
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,542
What?

389
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:56,688
About the eight years?

390
00:22:56,697 --> 00:22:59,845
I don't know. I don't
know what you're saying.

391
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:04,749
Shut up! Over there. Get over there.

392
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:07,916
Sit down!

393
00:23:07,944 --> 00:23:12,829
I interviewed him for the conference
in New York forWiredmagazine.

394
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:15,420
We had tea.

395
00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:18,472
That's what I meant by
"yesterday was amazing."

396
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:22,119
- You're lying.
- The interview... The interview was amazing.

397
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:25,852
Sarah,I need you to come to the phone
so we can talk about your safety.

398
00:23:34,892 --> 00:23:38,317
- What did you just do?
- Nothing.

399
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,707
- What did you just do?
- Nothing.

400
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,037
We've been trying to have
a baby for eight years.

401
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:47,242
Eight years of hormone
shots, IVF treatments.

402
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:50,112
We took out loans. We
drained the accounts.

403
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,413
It looks like we can afford it,right?

404
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:55,198
But we couldn't.

405
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:58,259
A year ago we get pregnant, finally.

406
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:00,390
But we didn't want to tell anyone
because we wanted to be sure.

407
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:04,228
So we waited-- one
month,two months,three...

408
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:08,048
At four months,we made this...

409
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:10,975
we made this room for the baby.

410
00:24:11,675 --> 00:24:14,391
We let ourselves believe.

411
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,467
We told everyone.

412
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:21,492
And we lost it.

413
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,594
How'd she handle it?

414
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:25,389
She fought back. She's a fighter.

415
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:28,546
I didn't want to give up.

416
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:32,951
For him.

417
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,712
He should be a father.

418
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:39,150
Is she delusional? Mentally unstable?

419
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,096
No. No,I mean she...

420
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,553
she was depressed for a
while, but she's not deluded.

421
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:48,497
Then tell me why she thinks you're having
an affair with a total stranger,Josh?

422
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,407
Boss,we're picking up
some kind of audio signal.

423
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:51,510
What kind of audio signal?

424
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,631
From the house, intercom maybe.

425
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,504
Patch it in.

426
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:57,259
- Josh,you guys have an intercom at your house?
- No.

427
00:24:57,268 --> 00:25:00,176
Walkie-talkies, anything?
We're picking up voices here.

428
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:03,448
I mean,we have a baby
monitor, but it wouldn't be on.

429
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,454
Where?

430
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:06,922
- In the nursery.
- What floor?

431
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:09,360
It's on the second
floor, front of the house.

432
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,895
Can you get it any clearer,Lou?

433
00:25:10,924 --> 00:25:12,652
I'm working on it.

434
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:19,456
Okay,team, we know we're not welcome
here, so let's go stealth, low and slow.

435
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:22,143
Spike and Wordy, I want
you on entry with me. Jules.

436
00:25:22,152 --> 00:25:23,419
My cousin has a baby monitor.

437
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,480
It's a two-way, so the kid can
hear the parents. It's worth a try.

438
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,833
Okay,try to tap into that frequency.

439
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:29,167
Sam,she's not going
to answer that phone.

440
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:30,213
We'll try this way in.

441
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:32,459
Jules,I want you to find a
scorpio position on the roof.

442
00:25:32,478 --> 00:25:35,040
I think I saw a skylight
up there. That'll be Plan B.

443
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:38,447
And bring a camera pole.

444
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:46,882
I just need to get through this without
you trying something again. Okay?

445
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:50,759
Okay,we got ears, and we're
good to talk anytime you say,Sam.

446
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:51,690
Channel 4.

447
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:57,112
Good work,Lou. I'm gonna need you on
entry with me, and get the husband's keys.

448
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:07,381
If you want to get out of here alive,

449
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,526
then you're going to tell
me what happened in New York.

450
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,409
You're going to tell me
why you were there with him.

451
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:21,660
What happened after tea?

452
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,664
Nothing.

453
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:30,643
What was so amazing then,hmm?

454
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:34,011
What do you want me to say?

455
00:26:34,568 --> 00:26:37,523
Huh,what do you want?

456
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:40,815
I lose either way,right?

457
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:45,901
What kind of answer do you expect when
you wave a knife in someone's face?

458
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:51,141
I will know the truth when I hear it.

459
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,047
You're not going to like the truth.

460
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:11,188
Go,Kira.

461
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,395
License plates coming at you.

462
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,468
All right, let's see what we got.

463
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:18,443
Josh,you recognize any of these?

464
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:24,220
Hannah Murray.

465
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:26,562
Oh,my God.

466
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:28,961
She rented a car that's parked
down the street. You know her?

467
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:31,850
She's a reporter from New York.

468
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,423
How do you know her?

469
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,717
Why would she... I
haven't seen her since...

470
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,320
Since when, Josh,since when?

471
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:39,863
Are you telling me that you
had a thing with this woman?

472
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:43,183
We got to know,buddy, 'cause if
you did, that changes everything.

473
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:45,707
I did.

474
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:48,586
I've known Josh for 18 years.

475
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:55,764
Before Sarah, we were
friends,really close,

476
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:58,144
but never more than friends.

477
00:27:58,173 --> 00:28:02,194
From the first moment we met, we
had a connection, you know,like...

478
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,518
a really strong connection like...

479
00:28:09,094 --> 00:28:11,454
the ones you can't really explain.

480
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:15,706
And we lost touch, and then one
day, I'm in New York in a conference,

481
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,873
and we bump into each other and sh...

482
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:22,231
she asked me if she could interview me.

483
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,408
Then I'm talking to him face
to face after all these years,

484
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:30,293
and it's like no time has passed.

485
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:33,546
Sarah and I were in
this really bad place.

486
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,452
I mean,I don't want blame it
on fertility treatments,but...

487
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:42,739
He said somewhere in there it was like you two
stopped having anything to say to each other.

488
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:46,789
Every conversation was about:
when's the next doctor's appointment,

489
00:28:46,818 --> 00:28:50,369
what are the odds, how,how are we going
to afford to pay for the next treatment?

490
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:54,284
And,you know,I-I don't want to
sound like I'm making excuses.

491
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:56,981
I-I don't want to make ex... oh,my God.

492
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,147
Josh was still Josh, but he'd changed.

493
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:02,527
I could see that.

494
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:07,901
He was sadder, like the life
had gone out of him. like...

495
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,942
like he'd forgotten how to laugh.

496
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:14,897
And you,you laughed.

497
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:20,914
Afterwards, I'm lying next to her,
and all I can think about is Sarah,

498
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:24,321
and I'm thinking to
myself, "What have I done?"

499
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,142
Spike,what's going on? I need eyes in.

500
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:30,732
Barricaded?

501
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:33,745
Sarah saw my father through
three rounds of chemo.

502
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:39,963
You know, she was there in the
hospital with me when my father died.

503
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:42,276
Oh,my God.

504
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,351
That one night was the
biggest mistake of my life.

505
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:53,005
It was the night that was always
meant to be. It was just 15 years late.

506
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,997
That night...

507
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,026
Oh,my God, he came alive again.

508
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,202
All right,I'm in position.

509
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:07,966
No joy yet-- I'm going
to try the camera pole.

510
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:11,498
Spike, get up there with Jules.

511
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,686
Sam,Sam, this is our last chance.

512
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:21,824
Unless you got something to go on, I got
to send Jules in on an explosive entry.

513
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,653
No,hold on the entry. Patch me into
the room. Let me give it a shot.

514
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:28,762
I couldn't tell Sarah,
I just... I couldn't.

515
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:34,731
You know,and when I got back, when I got
back,every time I looked at her, I just...

516
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:39,126
I loved her more, and I was so
scared that I was going to lose her,

517
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:41,573
you know,and that just,
that just changed everything.

518
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:44,663
It changed everything.

519
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:48,492
What have I done? What have I done?

520
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:52,638
Josh,you told us the truth.

521
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,621
You did the right thing.

522
00:30:58,953 --> 00:31:00,613
Are you ready Sam?

523
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,734
Yeah.

524
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:05,219
It's on channel 4.

525
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:08,137
- The baby...
- Yeah.

526
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:12,100
Is Josh the father?

527
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:22,906
Sarah? It's Sam,Sarah.

528
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,938
We were able to open a frequency
on that monitor in your room.

529
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:28,529
They're talking about
sending a team in there.

530
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,706
I don't want to send anyone in.
I want you to come out,Sarah.

531
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,834
Oh,God...

532
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,769
It's you.

533
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:41,398
That's why he gave up so easily.

534
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:43,404
'Cause...

535
00:31:43,413 --> 00:31:46,417
he wants to be with you.

536
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:50,601
And the baby.

537
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,949
Sarah,please,I need you to listen to me.

538
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,041
You know what he promised me?

539
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,113
He promised me...

540
00:31:59,142 --> 00:32:03,845
no matter what, through thick
and thin, we'd be together.

541
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,405
Is that what she's saying?

542
00:32:07,837 --> 00:32:09,545
That's what she's saying?

543
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:11,666
And I don't think any
of that's changed,Sarah.

544
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:14,084
No,no,no.

545
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:18,383
No,because when he got back
from New York, he was changed.

546
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:20,274
He was different.

547
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:23,249
Like he was trying too hard.

548
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:30,014
when the doctor told us to stop
trying, I couldn't stop crying.

549
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:35,801
He didn't cry. Not once.

550
00:32:35,811 --> 00:32:39,016
Tell her I did. I...
I just... it was just...

551
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:42,509
just never in front of her, 'cause I
wanted to be strong for her,I wanted...

552
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,513
I wanted to be strong for...

553
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:53,775
Look,just t-tell her I'm here.
Tell her that I... that I love her.

554
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,925
T-Tell her about the Bridge of Sighs.

555
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:57,441
Tell her about the Bridge of Sighs.

556
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,407
Boss,you get that entry option
lined up, you've got to go for it.

557
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,932
No,Ed,hold it.

558
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:04,101
Give the husband a headset.

559
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,667
Mr. Scott?

560
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,491
This is Sam Braddock; I'm
the guy talking to your wife.

561
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,391
Tell me about the Bridge of Sighs.

562
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,204
I got eyes.

563
00:33:15,512 --> 00:33:16,097
Tell me.

564
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:18,045
Knife is pointed down.

565
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,225
What's the subject's state?

566
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:23,208
She's crying,distracted. Boss,threat
is low. I can do this. I can see access.

567
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:26,087
Alpha One and Two,requesting
permission to enter,sir.

568
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,661
We go through the
skylight, we'll spook her.

569
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,072
She might use the knife.

570
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,029
Sir,she does not want to use that knife.

571
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:32,123
Do you know that?

572
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:34,685
This isn't aggression
anymore. This is grief.

573
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:36,797
She's almost done. She
just wants the truth.

574
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:40,818
Boss,I can see this. You're not seeing
it. Sam's not seeing it. I can see it.

575
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:43,687
We can be in there within
three seconds. We'll disarm her.

576
00:33:43,697 --> 00:33:45,770
The knife is down.
Repeat: the knife is down.

577
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,564
The truth is the only
thing she's been asking for,

578
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:50,002
her one demand, and
she's not getting it.

579
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:54,618
Okay. Okay,the knife
is still in her hand.

580
00:33:54,627 --> 00:33:57,746
Constable Braddock will
continue with negotiation.

581
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,625
Sarah?

582
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:07,074
Do you know what?

583
00:34:07,103 --> 00:34:09,684
I'm really not that
great with words,but...

584
00:34:09,703 --> 00:34:12,957
but I've been talking to a guy who is.

585
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,653
And he's been telling
me a lot about you.

586
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:19,261
About how he made a big mistake,
about how much he loves you...

587
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:21,133
That's not true!

588
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:26,190
And he wanted me to tell you...

589
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,513
about the Bridge of Sighs.

590
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:30,307
When my father died...

591
00:34:30,326 --> 00:34:33,867
And when his father died
and he'd lost his job,

592
00:34:33,877 --> 00:34:36,161
you bought two tickets to Venice,

593
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,877
and you said you'd walk over
the Bridge of Sighs together.

594
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:43,416
Yeah. To gain perspective.

595
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:45,844
When you've been through so many...

596
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:47,264
losses together...

597
00:34:47,283 --> 00:34:50,940
you're connected, you
belong to each other.

598
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,629
Always.

599
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:55,009
Sarah,Josh loves you.

600
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:59,068
It's taking about six of us to stop
him from rushing in there,Sarah.

601
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:00,978
You want the truth?

602
00:35:01,006 --> 00:35:04,835
This is it: he loves you.

603
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,664
Subject is down. Hostage has weapon.

604
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:16,083
Go,go,go,go!

605
00:35:21,543 --> 00:35:24,681
Move away from the door!
Move away from the door!

606
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:29,115
Down! Stay down! Put your
hands where I can see them!

607
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:31,312
- Stay down!
- Stay on the ground. Stay on the ground.

608
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:33,625
Keep your hands where I can see them.

609
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:39,143
Eddie,paramedics,right away.

610
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:47,137
Hey,buddy, what's her status?

611
00:35:47,175 --> 00:35:50,582
Unstable. Knife hit a major
vessel. Massive blood loss.

612
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:54,805
Sarah... Oh,my God.

613
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,655
Is she gonna be all right?

614
00:35:57,674 --> 00:35:59,948
We'll take care of her.

615
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:09,296
There. We'll get you in an
ambulance. They'll take a look at you.

616
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:16,570
Okaycome on.

617
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:19,410
Sarah,Sarah...

618
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:23,182
the hospital where the doc
will take a look at you.

619
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:27,673
This didn't have to happen.
This did not have to happen.

620
00:36:27,682 --> 00:36:29,755
There are always variables
that we can't anticipate.

621
00:36:29,765 --> 00:36:30,984
But,Sarge, we could've saved them both.

622
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:32,116
There's no way we could know.

623
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:36,550
"11:06 a.m.Callaghan: Boss,threat
is low. "I can do this. I see access.

624
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,707
"Braddock: She wants the truth.
She's responding. Give me a shot."

625
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:41,271
It was a risk either way.

626
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,835
Blah,blah,blah, blah,blah,blah.

627
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:47,202
"11:09 a.m. "Alpha One and Two, "explosive
entry through Black Charlie Three."

628
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:49,822
I had a connection. She did
not need to be subdued by force.

629
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:53,574
"Subject was lying prone on the
floor, a knife wound to the chest."

630
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:54,783
We know,Jules. We were there.

631
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:57,806
"11:17. Subject in critical
condition. Taken to hospital."

632
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:58,785
We were there.

633
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:01,549
I had eyes in. There was time
to get in. The knife was down.

634
00:37:01,558 --> 00:37:02,921
And then the hostage escalated.

635
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,253
Which she wouldn't have
if we'd already gone in.

636
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:06,788
Sam,you were the negotiator.

637
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:08,439
It's your right to
call it how you see it.

638
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:12,354
We can't second-guess whether an earlier tactical
response might have had a different outcome.

639
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:14,946
Due respect,sir,but it came
down to talk or tactics,

640
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:16,270
and you're the one that called talk.

641
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:16,999
That's right.

642
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:19,773
Because maybe that's the
call a negotiator would make.

643
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:22,143
Look,I'm just saying, all right?

644
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:23,515
I want to know what Ed would have done.

645
00:37:23,544 --> 00:37:25,137
It was the sarge's call!

646
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,479
I want to know,too.

647
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:31,164
Sometimes you do everything right.

648
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,878
Things still go wrong.

649
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:37,008
That's the job.

650
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,246
Situation was gray.

651
00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:41,586
The boss made a
black-and-white call.

652
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:45,309
We saved the hostage. Period.

653
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:50,338
Uh,sorry. The hospital
just called. Sarah Scott.

654
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:52,967
Doctors got her stabilized.
She's gonna be all right.

655
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,332
- That's great,Kira. Thanks for letting us know.
- Okay.

656
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,930
Okay,then. That's good. Right?

657
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:50,422
- Need to talk.
- Take a number.

658
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,567
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

659
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:56,727
Hey,Eddie.

660
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:00,843
I'm sorry.

661
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:03,060
Today should have gone better.

662
00:39:03,828 --> 00:39:06,976
You need to be back where you belong.

663
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:09,461
Team needs you back.

664
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:15,267
I'm thinking,I'm-I'm gonna
get Soph,I'm gonna get Clark.

665
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,163
We're gonna go up and get a
cottage,you know? Regroup,like you...

666
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:20,564
Like you said.

667
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:22,589
That's great. That's great.

668
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:27,858
You know,unless,uh, you feel
useless or something without me.

669
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,289
Decent.

670
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:41,255
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:42,464
I shouldn't have
jumped on you like that.

672
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:44,066
No,it's okay. I get it.

673
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:46,264
We all wanted them out safe.

674
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,534
What?

675
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,039
I don't know if we should do this.

676
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,467
Sneaking around on the team.

677
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,787
We put our lives in
each other's hands,and...

678
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:02,434
Yeah,and you're thinking
we should take a break.

679
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:05,217
I don't know. I don't
know what I'm thinking.

680
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:10,015
Me,neither.

681
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:12,319
Okay,so,take a break tonight?

682
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:14,660
Give us time to think?

683
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:20,764
Or we could think while
priming my drywall.

684
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:24,458
That's not fair.

685
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:27,721
You know how much I
love priming drywall.

686
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:32,452
Yeah,almost as much as you love my
protein-mango breakfast smoothies.

687
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:34,429
Don't do this to me.

688
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:37,270
I'm just saying.

689
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,887
It's all clear.
