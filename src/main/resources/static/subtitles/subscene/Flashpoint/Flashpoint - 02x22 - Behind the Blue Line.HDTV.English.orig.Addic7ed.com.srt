1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,171
Winnie?

2
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:10,168
Winnie!

3
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:11,545
Where were you?

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,494
Just making some copies.

5
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:13,539
We need the briefing room.

6
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:15,714
- Team three's prepping a warrant.
- Tell them to brief somewhere else.

7
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:18,042
- You let him get the drop on you.
- I let him... I was covering you!

8
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:19,708
Hey-hey, cool it!

9
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:20,785
Winnie, those files come in?

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,780
- I'm working on it.
- Winnie.

11
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,221
- I know!
- No talking to witness officers until you've...

12
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,443
I heard you the first time.

13
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:25,777
- Sam!
- You heard the man,

14
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:27,108
- Don't talk to witness officers.
- Sam,

15
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:28,831
- You gotta listen to me.
- Where you going Sam?

16
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,215
I'm gonna shower and go home.

17
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,684
- We're not done here.
- Well, maybe I am.

18
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,721
We got a debrief.

19
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,117
- I got nothing to say.
- It's not an option.

20
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:35,656
Get in there. Now.

21
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,346
- You okay?
- This is a subject officer.

22
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,955
- Yeah, I heard you the first time.
- I'm good.

23
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,509
Eddie, give the man your statement.

24
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:43,497
The rest of you, let's go!

25
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:44,397
Thank you.

26
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,556
Winnie, no one in there until this is done.

27
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:47,943
- Ok.
- Winnie, the files.

28
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:49,158
- Yeah.
- Come on!

29
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:01,961
The key's gonna be
bringing down the stands.

30
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,539
A few sticks of dynamite.

31
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:05,212
You're gonna need more than dynamite.

32
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:06,792
Whatever, just get it for next week.

33
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,351
My guys can't do it next week.

34
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:09,422
Then get new guys.

35
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:11,760
I can't get new guys.
No one wants this job.

36
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:13,394
Okay, I get it, I hear you.

37
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:17,683
A building like this, a heritage
building, so beige, so square,

38
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,168
and so much better when my big ass
tower is going right out of the middle.

39
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:25,944
Word of advice?

40
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:27,905
- Might wanna watch what you say.
-Why?

41
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,920
This place is like a temple to these guys.

42
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:30,893
Morning.

43
00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:31,928
Morning.

44
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:35,988
Tell me again the last time your
guys made the finals? Refresh me.

45
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,378
That's not the point.

46
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:38,715
Wasn't it half century?

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,096
42 years.

48
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:42,975
Yeah, might be time to move on.

49
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:45,061
So,

50
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:47,615
you're telling me these
stands are load bearing.

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,994
Help me get him outta here! Come on!

52
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:01,197
Hot call! Shots fired, Godwin Coliseum.

53
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:35,076
We got it, buddy, thanks.

54
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,523
How you doing?

55
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:38,352
- I've been better.
- You were in there?

56
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:40,475
Yeah, I'm the, uh, demolitions supervisor.

57
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,697
You get a visual on the shooter?

58
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:44,010
No, but we weren't looking
around. We got outta there fast

59
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:45,901
You get sense of what
direction the shots came from?

60
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:49,051
No, place is huge. There's a lot
of concrete, echoes. Like i said...

61
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:51,129
You were getting shot at,
you weren't thinking detail.

62
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:52,083
- I know.
- No, I'm sorry.

63
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,174
- Those the, uh, blueprints to the arena?
- Yeah.

64
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:55,358
You mind?

65
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,579
I'll see you in there.

66
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,061
- This is a friggin' nightmare.
- I understand sir.

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,851
How long is it gonna
take to nail this guy?

68
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:02,493
- If you can tell us...
- I need to get my men in there.

69
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,816
Sir, we're asking you again,

70
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,844
are you sure you can't recall any
detail of where the shots came from?

71
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,066
I didn't see anyone all right?

72
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:09,502
Why don't you get in there
and put my tax dollars to work?

73
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:10,906
- May I?
- Absolutely.

74
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:13,622
- What the hell you doing?
- What you can't tell us,

75
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:14,943
your wound will.

76
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,571
- Dammit!
- small bore,

77
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:19,087
downwards strafe The shot
came from somewhere high.

78
00:03:19,122 --> 00:03:20,500
Which way were you facing?

79
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,107
- What?
- Relative to the front door,

80
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:23,850
- Which way were you facing?
- That way.

81
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:25,737
Okay, so west.

82
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:28,414
So the shots came from
around here somewhere.

83
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:29,724
- Yup.
- Thank you, sir.

84
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,819
Best wishes for a eedy recovery.

85
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,018
I've got uniforms on every door.

86
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,175
Nobody's been in or out.
The guy's likely in there.

87
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:38,462
Could be more than one guy.

88
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:39,999
So everybody else is out of the building?

89
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:41,475
Security company says so.

90
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,382
There's one guard unaccounted
for, but he's on end of shift.

91
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:45,940
Probably gone home,
they're trying to confirm.

92
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,452
All right, good. Let's keep it contained.

93
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:48,800
- Jules?
- Copy that.

94
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:51,273
I'm gonna find you a place
to command post inside.

95
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:52,289
copy.

96
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:53,311
Eddie?

97
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:05,715
April 2nd, 1957.

98
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,168
You know who played here?

99
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,480
The Memphis Flash.

100
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,590
Boss, focus.

101
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,625
The king.

102
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:34,309
Hold-hold-hold hold-hold-hold.

103
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:36,652
Infrared sensor.

104
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:03,020
Everyone's good?

105
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:04,532
- Good.
- No problem.

106
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:13,825
Same impact point, each shot.

107
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,487
It's rigged to go when
someone walks across it.

108
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:18,436
- It's out of ammo.
- Clever.

109
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,681
Yeah, takes a bit of know-how.

110
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:22,790
That matches the angle
of the bullet wound.

111
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:26,001
That rifle's somewhere in the northeast.
I'm guesng somewhere in the blues.

112
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:28,857
Okay, you and Leah check
it out. Low and slow.

113
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:35,059
So, no shooter.

114
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,157
But we got a booby trap.

115
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:38,927
Means we may have more.

116
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:41,165
Sarge, there's a secure
room, east entrance.

117
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,794
Some kind of VIP lounge.

118
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:45,228
Copy that. We'll command post there.

119
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,622
Stove Club Lounge. Players and brass only.

120
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:49,602
I always dreamed of getting in there.

121
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,001
Pretty open.

122
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:00,036
Yeah.

123
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:05,856
The gun's right there.

124
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:07,181
- Ready?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:10,677
Cover me.

126
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:25,665
Jules, I got a serial number.

127
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,611
Great, I'll run it through the registry.

128
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:31,853
Everything you dreamed it was, wordy?

129
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:33,751
Still smell the cigars.

130
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:35,638
All right, we gotta
lot of ground to cover.

131
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:37,922
Boss, what're you thinking profile-wise?

132
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,782
Lots of people not happy
to see this place go.

133
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,728
So what, you shoot
somebody over a building?

134
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:43,982
It's not just a building.

135
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:47,218
Besides Elvis '57, you
got Winston Churchill,

136
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:50,280
the Beatles three times,
70 years of pro-hockey,

137
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:52,244
people met here, people married here.

138
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,966
Right, big emotional investment.

139
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,150
A lot of motives.

140
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:57,435
So, who's pushed far enough
do something about it?

141
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,952
All right, i gotta get
inside of that rink.

142
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:00,845
If he's set more traps
that's where they're gonna be.

143
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,778
Where the heart beats. Go careful, eddie.

144
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,805
Okay, wordy, grab the ball cam.

145
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,348
Sam, Leah, how's your vantage?

146
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,930
About 80 percent.

147
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:11,063
We're almost blind on the north side.

148
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,516
Sarge, got a hit on the rifle.

149
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:16,102
Belongs to a Max
Dykstra, downtown address.

150
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:17,743
Okay, let's send some uni's over there.

151
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:19,044
I got a guy ther on the way now.

152
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,235
I'm gonna try and get some
more background on this guy.

153
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,356
You got anything on
him besides the address?

154
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,134
No record, but he's a
retired hockey player.

155
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,266
One year pro, 1978.

156
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:29,579
That's good news, Jules.

157
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:31,477
Eddie, we may have a line on the object.

158
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,966
Copy that. Wordy.

159
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,063
Let's see if he left us anymore surprises.

160
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,376
This place is massive.

161
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,561
And lots of shadows.

162
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:06,345
Okay, clear.

163
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:08,963
Let's move in, a foot at a time.

164
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,810
We're looking for laser,

165
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,861
trip mechanisms, wires.

166
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,416
Eddie, talk to me!

167
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:29,426
I'm good. Wordy?

168
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:30,727
Uh-huh, no harm.

169
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:32,532
It's live fire!

170
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:34,708
We've got an active shooter.

171
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,446
He's here.

172
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,069
Transcripted by chamallow35

173
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:02,196
for www.Addic7ed.com

174
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,415
Those were targeted shots?

175
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,657
He's here.

176
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,399
He's watchng.

177
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:20,536
Sam, Leah, what do you got?

178
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:24,087
Ricochet mark on the south end.
Could be above us, could be below us.

179
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,938
Didn't see any muzzle flash.

180
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:27,239
He's in our blind spot.

181
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,337
Okay, could be the catwalk,
could be the gondola,

182
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:30,942
could be the grey seats,
it could be the greens.

183
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:33,075
'kay, we don't see anythin on the cam.

184
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,845
We gotta regroup and contain,

185
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,017
take this piece by piece.

186
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,610
Sarge, the owner of the rifle...

187
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,345
- Yeah, Jules, what?
- He was at home.

188
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,114
Then who's firing on my team?

189
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:43,716
It's his hunting rifle. He
says someone must've stolen it.

190
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,005
Claims not to know that it was missing.

191
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,118
And you believe him?

192
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,647
Ex-hockey player, hockey coach,

193
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,102
his rifle goes missing.

194
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:52,001
You know what they call
that in the police business?

195
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:53,419
- Hinky?
- hinky.

196
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:54,497
Interrogate him.

197
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:56,387
Uniforms are bringing him in.

198
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,622
Your unit is trespassing.

199
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:00,976
Leave the building immediately.

200
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:04,165
I repeat, you are trespassing.

201
00:10:04,998 --> 00:10:06,708
Leave right now.

202
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,489
Okay, the wires run
into the press gondola...

203
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,270
It's gotta be the announcer
booth, northeast corner.

204
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,298
Okay. Eddie, we're going up there.

205
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,641
Ed, you can get at it from the
south, but you gotta be careful, okay?

206
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:19,352
It's a long corridor and it's exposed.

207
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:20,958
Copy that. We're on our way.

208
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:21,919
Sam?

209
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,290
We can cover you, he
still might be in there.

210
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:35,202
- Ready?
- Yeah.

211
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,430
Clear.

212
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,066
Ed, you at the door yet?

213
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:40,859
Door's closed.

214
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:43,044
Sam, keep this hallway covered.

215
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:50,141
Clear.

216
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:55,191
Ready?

217
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:08,311
This guy wants to talk, let's talk.

218
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:10,215
This is Sergeant Greg
Parker with the poli...

219
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,281
Hold on.

220
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,189
He's cut the wires. Boss, i
don't think he wants to talk.

221
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:16,324
All right, who the hell is this guy?

222
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:17,527
Thoughts?

223
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:20,059
Young voice. Sounds under 30.

224
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:22,660
He mentioned the word "unit",
maybe there's a military connection?

225
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:25,124
or he knows we're the
strategic response unit.

226
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,465
All right, it's a pretty
sophisticated device for a civilian.

227
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,149
Okay, Jules let's look into
any recently returned vets.

228
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:31,355
It's a pretty wide net.

229
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,890
Cross reference guys
with criminal records.

230
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,937
Boss, you calling me?

231
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:37,109
What? No?

232
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:41,481
- Yeah.
- Why are you still here?

233
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:42,746
I'm glad you called,  is ed...

234
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:44,981
Get your unit outta here.

235
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:47,508
That was him. Where'd
you leave your phone.

236
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:48,922
- On the table, command post.
- You sure?

237
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,117
Yes, I'm sure!

238
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:51,734
There's only one way in there.

239
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,516
Get uniforms on the door.

240
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,414
Let's go, let's go, let's move it.

241
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:01,613
Officer.

242
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:03,605
Anyone walked through that
door in the past five minutes?

243
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,740
No, sir.

244
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:07,391
What, this guy walks through walls.

245
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,076
Let's take it up.

246
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:10,769
Go!

247
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,323
- Ready?
- yeah.

248
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:32,121
Sam.

249
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,336
Boss, give me your hand.

250
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:38,265
he may  have left us a he print.

251
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:49,481
He touched the wall.

252
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:50,996
Right there.

253
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:55,745
Straight ahead.

254
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:08,340
- Dammit rabbit hole.
- Spike.

255
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,092
No rabbit hole on the floor blades.

256
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,635
All right, he's got the upper hand.
He knows this place inside out.

257
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,147
All right, we're gonna need more intel.

258
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:16,994
Or he's gonna spend the afternoon
using this place as a shooting gallery.

259
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,687
When I was a kind, the
*** used to tell us about

260
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:21,691
hidden rooms, and passages.

261
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:25,019
Mostly retired guys, took the job
so they could see the game for free.

262
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,707
If anyone'd know, it'd be them.

263
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:27,679
Jules.

264
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:28,957
I'll find someone.

265
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,808
We should follow his
trail before it cools.

266
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,941
It's a confined space, we
don't know where it goes.

267
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:36,187
Yeah but it's either that or we sit around
waiting for grandpa to show us to our seats.

268
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,230
I'll go with him.

269
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:38,675
All right, no unnecessary risks.

270
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,118
Strict noise discipline.

271
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,566
Spike, I got a door on the left, anything?

272
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:08,601
You're still off the gridge.

273
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:16,828
Deny defeats and rise...

274
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:19,800
Deny defeats and rise on victory wings.

275
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:20,941
That's the dressing room.

276
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:24,676
I've got goosebumps, I'm
not even a hockey fan!

277
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:28,158
Fall back! Go! Go! Go!

278
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:29,785
- Hurry, hurry!
- Sam, Leah, status.

279
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,687
- Sam, talk to me.
- Status, status!

280
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:33,972
Go, go, go.

281
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,588
Move, move, move!

282
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,051
Get the water. let's get the water now.

283
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,015
Let's go.

284
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,736
- Bring it!
- Come on, come on, come on.

285
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,309
I gotta get this off.

286
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:54,913
What the hell is it?

287
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,274
Phosphorus.

288
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:58,535
Who get their hands on phosphorus?

289
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,177
A lot of stuff you can get in the
black market, but white phosphorus?

290
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:03,562
Afghanistan, leftovers from
the war with the Russians.

291
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:05,191
Well, this guy is military.

292
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:06,500
It didn't break the
skin, you're gonna be ok.

293
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:07,969
- And if it had?
- You would ***

294
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:09,961
- it would have damaged the organs.
- Son of a bitch.

295
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:12,419
Winnie crossed reference recent
vets with criminal records

296
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,722
I have 37 names.

297
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:15,105
We need a shorter short list.

298
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,933
They let guys with
records enter the military?

299
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,837
No, they get their records
after they come home.

300
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:20,298
Domestic disturbance,

301
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,019
assaults, DUI.

302
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,823
Possession of controlled subtances.

303
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:26,929
It's about recklessness and agression
on the lack of impulse control.

304
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:30,164
I'm trying to feel something
again. I don't feel something.

305
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,022
Ok.

306
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:35,133
Jules, one fo those 37 vets
might be taken this personnally.

307
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,658
I'm looking for a connection.

308
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:37,993
Sergeant Parker?

309
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:39,340
Yeah?

310
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,000
- You sent for...
- Charlie Howard.

311
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,367
I used to be an usher here 77 to 98.

312
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,097
Hey Charlie. Sergeant Parker,
sir. Thank you for coming.

313
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:49,532
Sergeant Parker, let me
get something straight.

314
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,058
Somebody's trying to stop this demolition

315
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:53,821
and you want me to help  you stop him?

316
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:56,863
Yeah, we hear you Charlie, but it's
his methods that we're not happy about.

317
00:15:56,898 --> 00:15:58,860
His methods Charlie, live fire,

318
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:01,067
chemical assault against my team.

319
00:16:01,102 --> 00:16:02,352
Ok. I got you.

320
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:05,483
And he's a step ahead of us, because
he knows every inch of this place.

321
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:06,715
You mean he's been squatting here?

322
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,226
It's a fair assumption.

323
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:09,261
Wow.

324
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,985
- Maybe he found the bunker.
- The bunker?

325
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,603
Daniel Gotwin's secret apartment.

326
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:16,172
I only saw it once. I mean
the man liked his privacy.

327
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,730
Can you show us where it is?

328
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,204
Hell, no. Hey, not on the map.

329
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,703
Like I said, I only saw
it once, and that was

330
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:24,728
wow, Toron versus Pittsburgh '87.

331
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:25,769
Let me guess, we lost?

332
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:27,199
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

333
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:29,057
All right. Charlie, this
is important here, okay?

334
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:30,040
You remember where?

335
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:32,092
I just remember it was
near a concession stand.

336
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,514
There's 24 concession stands.

337
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:36,339
Why don't you get up there? You know
the old muscle memory might kick in.

338
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:37,384
No, it's too risky Charlie.

339
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,457
Look, I... I gotta be
on my feet, all right?

340
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:41,792
Trust me, I'm the one that feel it.

341
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:45,386
All right, we take him in diamond
formation through the concession stands.

342
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,859
They got great visibility. He'll be safe.

343
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:48,894
Ok.

344
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,386
Wordy, Lee and Sam, let's go.

345
00:16:51,574 --> 00:16:53,929
Hey, let me try him on the
cellphone. Maybe he'll talk to me.

346
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:55,242
You okay if I keep Sam?

347
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:56,677
- Spike?
- Yeah.

348
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:00,707
All right Charlie, let's get
you dress. Guys, let's go.

349
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:03,433
Hey Jules, I'm sending
a text on boss' phone.

350
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:05,693
If this guy's picks up are you gonne
be able to patch him into the headset?

351
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:06,808
No problem.

352
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:11,394
Ok.

353
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:52,384
- Charlie?
- No.

354
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:54,634
I don't know if it's a sign, but

355
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:55,990
that's not it.

356
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:04,454
Braddock?

357
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,727
Aka Badass Junior.

358
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:07,970
That's right.

359
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,446
What do I get to call you?

360
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,923
What are you doing in my AO?

361
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,634
I'm just keeping the piece.

362
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:15,024
Braddock, I need you ***.

363
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,790
Copy that. I just need to know
that everything is gonna be okay.

364
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:19,302
I'm not gonna say it again.

365
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:21,036
I'm just glad to be back in the game.

366
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,075
I haven't been here
since the '94 playoffs.

367
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,915
Chicago, game 5.

368
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,282
See that game?

369
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,434
I want to fucking kill to see that game.

370
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,310
But I had a tournament in Hamilton.

371
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,704
Get out of here.

372
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:36,352
You must have been what? Bantam, pee wee?

373
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,560
Atom.

374
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,618
I didn't have a choice.

375
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,153
Team needed me.

376
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,622
So, how did it go on Hamilton?

377
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,282
It's the best we ever played.

378
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,721
- Really?
- Had to make it worth while, right?

379
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:02,192
Mr. Dykstra? Have a seat.

380
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:04,114
What the hell is going on?

381
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,856
My rifle get stolen, and I'm the
one getting the criminal treatment?

382
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:09,762
- Why didn't you report the theft?
- I didn't know there was a theft until you call.

383
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:13,630
So somebody broke into your garage,
went straight for a conceealed rifle.

384
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,810
- Didn't touch anything else.
- That's right.

385
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:17,579
Or you gave it to someone.

386
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,892
I didn't give it to anyone.

387
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:21,543
Then who knows where you
keep your locked rifle?

388
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,759
Why are you assuming that...

389
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,548
Because you're a hockey coach,
and this is the hockey arena.

390
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,903
And I'm not convinced
that this is a coincidence.

391
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:29,403
I wish I could help you.

392
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,606
Well, you're not leaving until you do.

393
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:33,599
What position did you play?

394
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:35,239
- All of them.
- Really?

395
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,682
You know, the coach made us crossed ***.

396
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:40,061
We had to think each position.

397
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,793
Cover for anyone.

398
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,090
Sounds like my unit.

399
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,541
So, why this place?

400
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:51,006
Nice place.

401
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,237
This is where anything
that ever matter happens.

402
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,170
All right, let's talk about the

403
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:07,108
divisional finals on Hamilton,
1994. Who was on that team?

404
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:11,338
I've 37 names of men who just came
back from military services overseas

405
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:13,026
who had a rocky landing.

406
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:16,600
It's gonna take me about ten minutes to get the
names of the guys in the team you've coached.

407
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:20,233
And about three seconds to narrow
that down to one name in common.

408
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,432
Look, there's a young man in there

409
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,979
and you know him.

410
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,049
And I'm guessing you care about him.

411
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:33,609
If you don't help me right now...

412
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:35,027
Darren Kovacs.

413
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:36,319
Thank you.

414
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:39,128
Subject's name is Darren Kovacs.

415
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:41,108
Thanks Jules. Winnie?

416
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:44,237
Find me family for Darren Kovacs.

417
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:45,304
Copy that.

418
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,528
See if you can get military records too.

419
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:48,831
Those could be classified.

420
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:50,542
Pull strings, whatever it takes Winnie.

421
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:51,597
Got it.

422
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:54,925
First time I saw him play was
right here at the coliseum.

423
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,358
It was a novice league
fundraiser. He blew everyone away.

424
00:20:58,393 --> 00:20:59,554
He was 8.

425
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:02,437
You know when you're here,

426
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,791
you know what you're for.

427
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:08,366
If you're on the stands,
or if you're on the ice.

428
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,394
You know what you're for.

429
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,655
You feel like you belong, I hear you.

430
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,671
I took him under my wing,
helped him out the ladder,

431
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,483
I mean, he... he was
this close to turn it pro.

432
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:18,679
What happened?

433
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:20,413
He comes to me one day, and he...

434
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,624
he tells me he wants to go serve
on another team for a while.

435
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:27,198
You know you can count
on your team. You know?

436
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:28,522
Through all the...

437
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:30,889
the blood, the sweat,

438
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:32,178
the crowd...

439
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,628
That was a promise.

440
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:36,390
Broke my heart to see him go.

441
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:40,288
And not... not just 'cause of the
hockey. We spent so many hours together.

442
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,339
He was such a damn good kid.

443
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,714
He told me he'd come back.

444
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:47,772
He came back.

445
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:49,328
Most of him.

446
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:52,670
You know, when things got bad over there,

447
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:54,756
I...

448
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,264
I had one thing that I could hold on to.

449
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,889
I knew I'd be back here one day.

450
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:04,706
Back at the Goldwin Coliseum.

451
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:06,668
***

452
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:17,344
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

453
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,955
Server uniforms.

454
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,911
This is it, I'm sure. It's in there.

455
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:34,928
All right, we've got a 20 on the
***. Le's get uniforms up here.

456
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:37,475
Send them in the back
through a secure passage.

457
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:39,967
He sat in my living room there, last week,

458
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:43,353
it... it was the first time
I saw him since he got back.

459
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:45,053
I barely recognized him.

460
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:46,611
When I get back here,

461
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,271
and they're tearing it down...

462
00:22:51,573 --> 00:22:53,322
I lived through all that.

463
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,545
And for what?

464
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,826
The lifestyle condos, and the parking lot?

465
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:02,261
He sat there.

466
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:03,492
He was empty.

467
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:06,304
He... he... it was like
he's mind was somewhere else.

468
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:07,851
Like he was sleep walking.

469
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:10,089
What happened to him over there.

470
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:12,459
Never told me.

471
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,397
Condos and a parking lot, just
what downtown needs more, right?

472
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:51,035
Pictures from the front.

473
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,222
Looks like his unit.

474
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:55,910
Sending a picture.

475
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,499
Syotos, Sam?

476
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:04,757
No. He doesn't know Spike.

477
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:06,714
Darren, are you there still?

478
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:08,342
Darren?

479
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:10,746
You guys must be close, he's not talking.

480
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:12,105
Hey guys, guys.

481
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,499
I gotta go.

482
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,761
He's on the move.

483
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:24,972
On three.

484
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,683
One, two, three.

485
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,640
Darren Kovacs!

486
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:40,933
Get down, get down, get down!

487
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:47,929
Eddie?

488
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,013
Flashbag.

489
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,425
In pursue.

490
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,833
- I'm on my way.
- Sam, *** concessions.

491
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,058
He's got down the escalators.

492
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:10,359
Anything?

493
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:11,437
No joy.

494
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,906
He cut the power.

495
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:18,257
Sarge, I got Darren's father on the line.

496
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,985
Copy that Jules. Eddie?

497
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,265
I'm not going in blind
so he can shoot us again.

498
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,433
We get the power on,
we're going after him.

499
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:25,486
Ed?

500
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:27,304
Ed, he's been shooting to miss.

501
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:30,163
You don't know that. He's injured two
people today, Sam, and you're of them.

502
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:31,722
That wasn't personnal. Now it is.

503
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:33,855
- Sam.
- I got a connection boss.

504
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:36,234
I know where this guy is coming from.

505
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:38,222
First solution is to talk, right?

506
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,476
You be objective.

507
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:42,269
But I saw you over here,
I know how it works.

508
00:25:42,304 --> 00:25:43,499
Ok, Ed.

509
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:45,527
Ed, dig in, take cover.

510
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:48,105
Let's do what we do,
let's talk him out. Sam?

511
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,312
Yeah boss.

512
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,706
I'm letting you do this.

513
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:51,843
Thanks boss.

514
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,292
And he has not been getting
any professional help?

515
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:56,789
Uh, asking for help is
not one of his thing.

516
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:58,663
Sounds like your son, huh,

517
00:25:58,698 --> 00:26:01,171
grow up with a lot of
expectations around him.

518
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:03,503
Yeah, but, it never went to his head.

519
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:05,226
Darren was always just,

520
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:07,300
he was always afraid
to disappoint the people

521
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:10,394
who believed in him. That's
why he worked so hard.

522
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:11,917
And then when he came back home?

523
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:14,238
He just... cut himself off.

524
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,529
Started... you know he
wouldn't talk to anybody,

525
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:18,289
he started the drinking, and

526
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:21,175
picking fights with strangers.

527
00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:23,249
Did he ever tell you why?

528
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:25,250
Hang on, I'm nearly there.

529
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,693
Braddock?

530
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:31,757
Yeah.

531
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,755
Where did you get my name?

532
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:38,594
It's... it's our MO. We like
to know who we're talking to.

533
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:42,119
I was in the forces for a
couple years when I was young.

534
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:44,810
And so was my dad. I mean, thats...
this way you're supposed to do.

535
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:46,610
You serve your country.

536
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:50,364
But when Darren told me, that
he wanted to take his turn,

537
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,238
I wasn't happy.

538
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:54,289
It was a bright future
he was putting on hold.

539
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:55,624
I knew it.

540
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:58,935
It killed me to see him do that.

541
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:02,689
But I always told my
son,you make your choices.

542
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:05,027
So I couldn't stand in his way.

543
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:06,962
Where was he deployed?

544
00:27:06,997 --> 00:27:08,425
Kandahar.

545
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:10,324
Hey,

546
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,382
you found his... his musketeers.

547
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,417
Hey!

548
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:16,569
It's Howie Carson, his right winger.

549
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:19,581
And a little higher, Jordan and Pete.

550
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:21,504
Those guys,

551
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,601
they mean everything to him.

552
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:27,246
What happened in Kandahar?

553
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:29,885
Well,

554
00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:32,915
he lost them.

555
00:27:36,914 --> 00:27:39,761
Yeah. And what else do you know?

556
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,576
I know what it was like over there.

557
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:44,964
You know your war.

558
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:47,144
You don't know mine.

559
00:27:47,754 --> 00:27:49,734
I know. Everyone's different.

560
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:53,132
Sam, Darren lost his three closest
friends in a patrol near Kandahar.

561
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:56,419
AED took them out, he walked
away without a scratch.

562
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:57,527
Copy that.

563
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:03,105
You wanna know what my war was Kovacs?

564
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,279
I'm a long distance marksman.

565
00:28:05,314 --> 00:28:06,414
Sniper.

566
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:07,735
Yeah.

567
00:28:08,545 --> 00:28:11,478
And I served with a
friend too. Close friend.

568
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:12,513
Ben.

569
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:15,140
He didn't make it.

570
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:19,020
When I found him, he'd been hammered

571
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:20,825
with a .50 cal.

572
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:23,154
There was nothing of him left.

573
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:26,388
Sam, what's your game plan here?

574
00:28:26,423 --> 00:28:27,978
He has to know, I understand.

575
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:28,929
I get that.

576
00:28:28,964 --> 00:28:30,709
He has to hear that he is not alone.

577
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:32,350
Ok. You don't have to push too hard.

578
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:34,793
Boss, trust me on this.
This is what I can do.

579
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,855
Kovacs, is that Hungarian?

580
00:28:36,905 --> 00:28:39,526
- Yeah.
- Syotos means anything?

581
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:44,124
No.

582
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:46,024
Me and my guys,

583
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,040
we went everywhere together.

584
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:49,552
All for one.

585
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:52,454
But that night,

586
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,681
I was thirsty, so I, huh,

587
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:58,665
slowed down to go to my canteen.

588
00:29:00,124 --> 00:29:03,346
I was 20 paces ahead
when the bomb went off.

589
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:05,567
Darren, you didn't plant that AED.

590
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:07,324
If it hadn't been for me,

591
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,673
Howie never would have sign up.

592
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:14,252
He did it for me.

593
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:19,342
And now, I have his blood on my hands.

594
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:23,911
And you don't know what that's like.

595
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:29,161
Yeah I do.

596
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,420
The shot that took out Ben, that was...

597
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:36,863
that was me.

598
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:41,842
I was given the order, I
was cleared to fire, and I...

599
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:46,464
I took the shot. He was in the
wrong place, in the wrong time.

600
00:29:47,163 --> 00:29:50,788
And I killed my best friend
from 2 kilometers away.

601
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:52,961
I killed him.

602
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,739
I...

603
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:59,464
I thought I was gonna go
crazy, but I got through it.

604
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:05,134
You've got a place in
your mind where you go to,

605
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:08,324
when you can't take it anymore.

606
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:10,966
When you think you're gonna die?

607
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:14,929
And you think that you'd rather
be dead than be where you are.

608
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:15,964
Yeah.

609
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:18,847
And for us, me and Howie

610
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:21,335
this was it.

611
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:27,403
We knew if we could just
make it back, you know...

612
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,635
We'd close our eyes, and

613
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:36,244
we'd imagine ourselves
back here in center ice.

614
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:46,146
Now they're gone.

615
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,041
Howie's gone.

616
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:55,756
And I can't let me back in there.

617
00:30:56,611 --> 00:30:58,164
And I got nothing here.

618
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:01,850
I got nothing to see me through.

619
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,393
I thought it was over for me too, Darren.

620
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:08,435
I know, ok?

621
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:09,994
I know.

622
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:14,611
But I found a different place to
go, a different person to be...

623
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,189
that's why I'm here, so let me help you.

624
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,877
What was your first name again Braddock?

625
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:23,603
It's Sam.

626
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,338
I'm tired Sam.

627
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:35,236
Then let's get some rest.

628
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:38,002
Let's do this together.

629
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,135
Ok.

630
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:43,322
Nicely done Sam. All
right, let's bring him home.

631
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:46,240
All right Darren, I need you to...

632
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:48,631
I need you to put down your gun.

633
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:51,209
Ok, I will.

634
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:54,830
And I need you to come down at the
bottom of the escalators concessions area.

635
00:31:55,768 --> 00:31:57,232
- No.
- Darren.

636
00:31:57,607 --> 00:31:59,084
Center ice.

637
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,287
And it has to be you.

638
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:02,951
Too exposed.

639
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:04,158
Darren I can't.

640
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:05,693
Center ice.

641
00:32:06,197 --> 00:32:07,732
I'll be there.

642
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,303
Almost there.

643
00:32:09,338 --> 00:32:10,650
Nice work Sam.

644
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:12,631
All right, let's do this.

645
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,564
I want his covered boss.

646
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,639
Bring me Sam's rifle. Leah, spot me.

647
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:18,549
Spike, Wordy, you cover Sam.

648
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:21,185
He's unarmed and in plain view.

649
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,967
Basic precautions Sam.

650
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:25,193
He trusts me. If he sees
rifles what does that tell him.

651
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:27,432
Ok, but how do we know we can trust him?

652
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,420
Well, that's your first sign.

653
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:31,498
Yeah.

654
00:32:33,853 --> 00:32:36,396
So, after Darren lost his
friends, what happened?

655
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:39,818
Well, they sent him home.
Before his tour was up.

656
00:32:39,853 --> 00:32:41,225
How did he take that?

657
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,123
He wasn't happy.

658
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:47,646
He applied to get back into combat.

659
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:49,826
But all the requests was denied.

660
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:53,511
They said he was no longer eligible.

661
00:32:57,823 --> 00:32:59,312
In position.

662
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:01,069
You're good to go.

663
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,413
He wouldn't tell me why.

664
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,663
Just that you know, they were
wrong, he was a good soldier...

665
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:08,358
I'm right behind you Sam. Spike?

666
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:10,468
But I knew in my gut,

667
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:13,315
I knew why they wouldn't take him back.

668
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:16,520
There he is.

669
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:25,032
Darren it's me.

670
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:28,056
It's Sam.

671
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,364
You made the right decision.

672
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:42,610
We're gonna get through this ok?

673
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,888
I'm here.

674
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:45,423
You see Sam?

675
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:47,169
I'm a good soldier.

676
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:49,899
Get down on the ground.
Hands on your head.

677
00:33:56,427 --> 00:33:58,080
Get down on the ground. Now!

678
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,986
Stop man. What are... what are you doing?

679
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,255
Think about this.

680
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:07,349
You don't need to do this.

681
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:08,498
Sam, stop.

682
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,462
I mean, think about what you're doing.

683
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,087
I don't have a shot.

684
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,802
Sam, stay right where you are.

685
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,876
I promised we would
get through this, but...

686
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:21,611
Get him to come to you.

687
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,642
But... this is something we can
work through. You just have to...

688
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:28,853
you just have to trust and
we can get through this, ok?

689
00:34:28,994 --> 00:34:30,505
I'm a good soldier.

690
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:32,744
And I needed you to know that.

691
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,865
I know that, buddy, I...

692
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,724
you gotta stay with me,
ok? Please stay with me.

693
00:34:39,306 --> 00:34:40,818
See you on the other side.

694
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:51,951
Subject down.

695
00:34:59,134 --> 00:35:00,541
Why did you do that?

696
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,654
He wasn't gonna shoot.

697
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:07,642
I coulda stock it out.

698
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:22,455
He wasn't gonna shoot.

699
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:26,193
He wasn't gonna shoot!

700
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,376
All right, stay there.

701
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:35,463
Any weapons?

702
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:37,548
No, I'm a security guard. I work here.

703
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,470
- What?
-I work here, I'm a security guard.

704
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:41,650
All right, get up.

705
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:44,205
When the shooting started, I
just went inside, it was stupid.

706
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:45,693
It's ok.

707
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:49,642
As soon as I see him, ***,
and put me in the closet.

708
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,470
Jjust now he came back.

709
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,697
He said he'd shoot me if
I didn't do what he said.

710
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:55,759
- I'm so sorry.
- It's ok.

711
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:58,583
I'm so sorry.

712
00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:02,041
That's my son, that's my son.

713
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:03,833
That's my son in there.

714
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:05,146
Look, you can't go in.

715
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:08,310
That's my son in there.

716
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:24,505
He wasn't gonna shoot.

717
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,829
He was an immediate threat.

718
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,173
It took him 30 seconds to turn the tables.

719
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,564
We gave him the upper hand
because we trusted him.

720
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,146
No. I trusted him.

721
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:34,407
You killed him. It didn't
have to be like that.

722
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,126
He was clearly threatening
both Spike and you.

723
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,411
Sam, you did great, you
just... you lost perspective.

724
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:41,075
You put yourself right
in the line of fire.

725
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,075
I knew him! Do you understand, I knew him.

726
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:47,591
Oki, what do you think he wanted Sam?

727
00:36:48,095 --> 00:36:49,864
He wanted to save the arena.

728
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:51,446
His military files.

729
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:56,233
No, look, he needed a mission,
to... to find the last place left

730
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:58,600
where things made sense.
Where things were fair.

731
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:59,807
He wasn't gonna hurt me.

732
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,296
We couldn't take that chance.

733
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:03,311
You've never taken that chance?

734
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,093
I've seen you do it!

735
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,569
He's got a point.

736
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:10,448
You've done it, I've done it, but
the question is, why did you do it?

737
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:11,927
For Darren?

738
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,743
Or for Ben?

739
00:37:14,763 --> 00:37:18,196
Maybe you wanted a second
chance to save your friend.

740
00:37:20,183 --> 00:37:22,093
- Jules.
- Darren applied to return to service.

741
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:23,875
He wanted to go back.

742
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,222
Why was he denied?

743
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:27,754
Because they found him
psychologically unfit.

744
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:31,586
Darren suffered from post-traumatic
stress, and he wanted to go back.

745
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:35,711
Sam, what was the last thing he said?

746
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:37,890
Huh, he said, huh,

747
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,632
"I'm a good soldier."

748
00:37:40,984 --> 00:37:42,964
Roll back the tape.

749
00:37:48,074 --> 00:37:49,199
Right there.

750
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,300
Pump the volume.

751
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:51,789
Now.

752
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:58,582
What did he say?

753
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,773
"See you on the other side."

754
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,400
He said "see you on the other side."

755
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:14,193
Syotos.

756
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:16,560
***

757
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:18,599
Yeah, but not this time.

758
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,072
He was saying goodbye to you Sam.

759
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:23,732
That's why he wanted to go back.

760
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,474
He thought he should have died with
his friends the first time around.

761
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,398
"I'm so tired."

762
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:35,659
That's when he knew that it was over.

763
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:37,499
Sam.

764
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:41,929
His connection with you was real man.

765
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,859
But he knew what he wanted.

766
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:48,894
And there's nothing you could
have done Sam, to change that.

767
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,945
"It has to be you."

768
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,894
- He wanted me to kill him.
- Come on Sam.

769
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,152
It's all right, I get it.

770
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,019
Look,

771
00:39:12,382 --> 00:39:14,562
when I left the field and I joined the SOU

772
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:16,215
I didn't want to be a point-shoot guy

773
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,867
that could take people from mile away.

774
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:19,273
I wanted to...

775
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:22,144
save people, you know?

776
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,441
And the one I should
have been able to reach,

777
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:28,953
I mean the one guy,

778
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:30,593
I couldn't.

779
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:33,991
I wasn't objective, I put my team at risk.

780
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:36,511
I don't belong here.

781
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:24,453
It doesn't get any easier.

782
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,133
We don't get to win every time.

783
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:33,547
You gotta be at peace with who
you are to get through that.

784
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:37,367
There's a bunch of guys I know,
they're cops, military guys

785
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:40,918
we meet up and we talk, and we
help each other keep it together.

786
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:43,648
Greg and I are going for it tonight.

787
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:46,039
You should come.

788
00:42:18,593 --> 00:42:19,776
