1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,897
We need to go now.
The vents aren't on.

00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:04,332
<i>Spike: The venting system
must've been knocked off-line</i>

3
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:06,867
when Xavier sabotaged
the power generator.

00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:08,035
Woman:
My leg!

5
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,469
I can't feel my leg!

00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:11,905
<i>(Pained cry)</i>

7
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:13,907

<i>Anything over 2500's fatal.</i>

9

2500...

10
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:20,580
Sam: She needs medical
attention, okay?

11
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:21,981
You all do.

12
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:24,350
<i>You need to let everybody out</i>
<i>now.</i>

13
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:25,517
Jules?

14

<i>Jules!</i>

15
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:29,021

(Door beeps)

18
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:48,573
That's a test subject?

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,607
Yes.

20
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,608
It's not contained.

21
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,743
I did.
I double bagged it.

22
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,844
You double seal it,

23
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:54,211
and then you put it
in a container.

24
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:55,412
The subject may be dead,

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,280
but the pathogens
that killed it

26
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,748
are very much alive,

27
00:00:57,815 --> 00:00:59,216
understand?

28
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,718
- Be careful.
- I'm sorry, sir.

29
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,189

31
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,264
Greg Parker.

32
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,065
Dr. Toth, hello.

33
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:20,069
Very well, thank you.
How are you?

34
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:23,039
Okay.
You wanna a tell me why?

35
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,843
Yes, I know what it's in there.

36
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:31,413
Ben, incident report last
month, the 17th.

37
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:34,349
No, that can't be right.

38
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,517
Hey.

39
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:36,385
Set it up in the briefing room.

40
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:37,552
Ben:
You got it.

41
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:39,754
Yeah, I'll be here.

42
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,358
(Lock clanks)

43

(Exhales)

46
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,882
Dammit!

47
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,717
What's going on?

48
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,953
Parker: They forgot
to turn their mics off.

49
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:15,654
Jules and Sam.

50
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:17,256
I thought they were done.

51
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:18,657
Well, they're not.

52
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:20,692
That was the condition,
when she rejoined the team.

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,328
- I know.
- Priority of life.

54
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,063
I gotta tell you, Eddie,

55
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,698
I knew it was happening.

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,567
How long?

57
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,101
Two months.

58
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,903
And I made the choice
to let it go on.

59
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:34,605
What happened to
no mo secrets, Greg?

60
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:35,639
This way, it's just on me.

61
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:37,575
It's not your job, it's mine.

62
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:40,044
It's your job?
What do you mean?

63
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:41,412
When Dr. Toth put this team
on probation

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,014
I gave him my word
that Sam and Jules

65
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:44,215
wouldn't cross the line.

66
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:46,516
Well, what's he gonna do?

67
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:47,684
Greg?

68
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,458
(Keypad beeps)

69
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,693

<i>Turn around!</i>
<i>Hands behind your back!</i>

72
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,998
<i>Move it!</i>

73

<i>Ben: Team one, hot call.
Gear up.</i>

74
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,105
- Go.
- What do you mean? What's going on?

75
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,006
I got no choice.

76
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,041
- Greg!
- Go. Just go.

77
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,377
I don't want the team
distracted by this.

78
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,511
Go!

79
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,546

<i>Ed:</i>
<i>What're we looking at, Spike?</i>

82
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:26,488
All right, it's a level three
biohazard research facility.

83
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:28,189
Meaning what?

84
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:29,790
Spike: Well, meaning it's classified.
But hold on.

85
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:32,027
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>
<i>Private company,</i>

86

<i>Viruses, toxins, pathogens,</i>
<i>all kinds e exotic bacterias.</i>

<i>This stuff gets out,</i>

<i>it's like biological WMD's</i>
<i>with mass casualties.</i>

Ed: Okay, okay. Ben?
<i>Ben: Go ahead.</i>

94
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:52,311
We need a Hazmat team
with a decontamination unit.

Okay, thank you.
Appreciate it.

111
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:22,273
Officer,
I don't know if you're aware,

112
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,774
but our facility...

113
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,276
<i>If the wrong person</i>
<i>were to get their hands</i>

Ed:
We're aware.

116

<i>Bergan: All it would
take is a subway car,</i>

117
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,282
an office building,

118
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,749
a vent.

119
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:33,584
Ed: Doctor, best thing
you can do right now

120
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:35,186
is to let us handle it.

121
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,387
Keep your phone handy,
we'll call you if we need you.

122

125
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,100
Rose, is this building
fully evacuated?

126
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,568
Apart from
the central personnel.

127
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:52,802
We need everybody
outta there now.

128
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:54,503
Tests are still in progress
in the lab.

129
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,972
Samples of sensitive materials
have to be properly contained.

130
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,440
Well, how many people
we talking about here?

131
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,008
Two: Our chief scientist
and his second,

132
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:01,577
and they'll be done
as soon as possible.

133
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,145
Ed: Okay, any word from
the security guard?

134
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:05,280
Rose: No, but one of our
workers was found tied up

135
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:06,615
in the waste disposal lockup.

136
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:07,849
Okay, did he get
any descriptions?

137
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,084
No, he was attacked
from behind;

138
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,651
he didn't see a thing.

139
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:11,419

00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:24,932
We're gonna try to locate
and extract any of the victims.

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,566
Rose?

148
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:27,834
<i>Can you help us out</i>
<i>with staging area inside?</i>

149
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,669
Rose:
I've brought you passcards.

150
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:31,138
Keep them on your person.

151
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,572
These give you access
to the entire building.

152
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,441
I would advise that you don't go
into the clean room

153
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:35,908

154
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:37,310

Let's do it.

157
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,287
Power's out.

158
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,522
Rose:
This shouldn't be happening.

159
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,689
We have precautions
against blackouts.

160
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:52,424
Sam:
You have backup generators?

161
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:54,993
Rose: Of course, but every
second of downtime's dangerous.

162
00:05:58,264 --> 00:05:59,730
What's going on, Ben?

163
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,399
Ben: Active shooter.
No confirmed victims yet.

164
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:04,536
Just keep me informed,
all right?

165
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:06,471
Sure thing, boss.

166
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,073
Greg, I'm sorry to do this.

168
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,177
I'm here to suspend you

00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:55,444
Right there.

172
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:57,814
And he took the guard
in that direction.

173
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,347
Essential personnel?

174
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,817
There, in the clean room.
Laboratory one.

175
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,085

Rose, tell your team
we're on our way.

178
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,690
Guys, with me.
Let's move.

179
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:11,060
Spike, get Rose to help us
into the mainframe.

180
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:12,695
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Suspended.</i>

181
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:16,197
I was expecting
a bigger reaction.

182
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:17,598
Parker:
Conditionally? Permanently? What?

183
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,934
Toth:
That will depend on you.

184
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:22,603
Team one's probation period
is now over.

185
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:23,838
But...

186
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:26,207
I'm left with two
major concerns.

187
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:28,776
One is your judgment
as sergeant,

188
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:29,944
regarding the relationship

189
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:31,411
between Callaghan and Braddock,

190
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,213
which you made the choice
to conceal.

191
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,447
That's right.

192
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:35,782
The other concern,

193
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,250
equally critical
to your team's safety,

194
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:41,154
is your judgment
of your own judgment.

195
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:44,457
<i>Second guessing,</i>
<i>self-doubt...</i>

196
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:48,460
This is the subtext
of all your reports,

197
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:50,062
<i>transcripts,</i>

198
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,964
<i>self-evaluations.</i>

199
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:54,533
You openly question
your own decision-making.

200
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,268
How can you captain a ship,

201
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:59,205
if you've lost
your own compass?

202
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:00,940
Any rebuttal?

203
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,242
Or am I right...

204
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:05,409
that you're relieved
someone else

205
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,712
has finally made the choice
for you?

206
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,415
<i>So...</i>

207
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,053
Please sign here and here

208
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:19,790
and I'll need you to relinquish
<i>your badge and sidearm.</i>

209
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:22,059
What about Braddock
and Callaghan?

210
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,762
They will be reassigned
to different teams.

211
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,396
<i>(Pen thunks on table)</i>

212
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,866
That's not gonna work.

213
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:36,839
Northwest hallway clear.

214
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,442
Lab three clear.

215
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,210
Sam: No sign of a gunmen,
no further shots fired.

216
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,211
Copy that.

217
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,147
(Rose's phone rings)

218
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:45,415
Dr Bergan.

219
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,549
<i>Dr. Bergan:</i>
<i>Rose, fill me in.</i>

220
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:47,651
<i>Rose:</i>
<i>The police are here.</i>

221
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:49,719
They haven't located
the gunmen as yet,

222
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:50,853
and we lost power.

223
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:51,853
<i>Bergan:</i>
<i>How long?</i>

224
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,489
If refrigeration's down...

225
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:55,291
<i>Rose, you know what</i>
<i>that material's worth.</i>

226
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:56,925
Of course I do.

227
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:59,495
But with armed intruders in,
there seems little point...

228
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:01,196
Power's back.
We're good.

229
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:03,165
I'll be there as fast as I can.

230
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:04,466
<i>Spike: Ma'am, I'm gonna need
access to your computers.</i>

231
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:05,934
Rose: I'll call you back.
Spike: Passwords please.

232
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:08,169
Rose: Sure.
Spike: Now.

233
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:10,037
(Computer keys clack)

234
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:12,540
(Lights click on)

235
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,709
SRU. You guys okay?

236
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:16,043
Uh, fine.

237
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:17,445
It's probably best
if you stay outside the lab

238
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:18,913
until these samples
are secured.

239
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,915
Logan: Is that bogeyman
still on the loose?

240
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:22,417
We're working on locating him
right now.

241
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,851
We need you guys to evacuate
as soon as possible.

242
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:27,754
<i>Applewhite: Well, we need at
least another 20 minutes.</i>

243
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:29,088
Some of the samples
started to thaw

244
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:30,457
when we lost power.

245
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:32,326
Filiform gets real cranky
at room temperature.

246
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:35,729
Guys, we need another
20 minutes in here.

247
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,831
Okay.
What's filiform?

248
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:39,265
Rose:
It's a strain of anthrax,

249
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,534
refined and weaponized
during the cold war.

250
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:43,902
We're working on a vaccine.

251
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,104
<i>Parker: If I had told them to end
it, they would have listened,</i>

252
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:48,374
but I didn't.
It's on me, not them.

253
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,242
They made their own choice,

254
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,745
after already having been
granted a second chance.

255
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:54,179
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Come on, doctor,</i>

256
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:55,347
look me in the eye
and tell me if you've ever,

257
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:56,848
in all the calls
we've had this year,

258
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:58,316
seen their judgment
or their performance

259
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:00,251
impaired by their relationship.

260
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,453
Not yet.

261
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,987
But it's only a matter of time

262
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:04,723
before their instinct
to protect each other

263
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,924
overrides the safety
of a citizen.

264
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:08,125
This is why we have

265
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:09,728
the priority of life protocol.

266
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:11,595
You like assuming the worst,
Larry?

267
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:14,164
Don't lecture me, Greg.

268
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:16,433
Imagining I could've
kept someone safe

269
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,301
but didn't?

270
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,738
<i>That's what keeps me up</i>
<i>at night.</i>

271
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,954
(Clang in the distance)

272
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:40,089
Here we go.

273
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:45,159
Police!

274
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:47,596
Raf: Clear!
Sam: Clear!

275
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,130
Ed:
You all right?

276
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,231
<i>Raf: We have the
guard, unharmed.</i>

277
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:51,299
He just left through that door.

278
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:52,401
<i>He took my gun.</i>

279
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:53,101
Ed: One guy?
Guard: Yeah.

280
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,302
Go! Go!

281
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,541
Sam:
We've lost visual.

282
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,242
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>Spike, you seeing him?</i>

283
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,812
<i>Spike: I got nothing.
He's avoiding the cameras.</i>

284
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,046
(Computer key clacks)

285
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:07,748
We heard gunshots.
Any wounded?

286
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:09,517
He shot out
the power generator.

287
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,351
Power generator?

288
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,787
Guard: I didn't have the passkey
to get him into secure storage.

289
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:14,522
He must have known this building
has electronic locks.

290
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:15,789
So he knows the place.

291
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:16,956
Yeah. He was looking
for something

292
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,124
in the deep freeze.

293
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:19,426
When he couldn't find it,
he lost it.

294
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:20,894
And what'd he say?

295
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,161
He said he wasn't gonna let 'em
get away with it.

296
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:23,696
Spike, gunman knows the place.

297
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,064
It sounds personal.

298
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:26,265
Gonna bring the guard
to you right now,

299
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,567
see if he can id the subject.

300
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:29,135
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

301
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:30,937
Rose, we're gonna need photos

302
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:31,970
past and present.

303
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:33,505
<i>Rose:</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

304
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:34,907
<i>Gunman:</i>
<i>No, I couldn't find it.</i>

305
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:36,508
No, the police got in the way.

306
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,577
Look, you gotta come here.

307
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:40,345
That's not...
Look, that's not gonna...

308
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:43,482
No, it's not gonna work
and you know it.

309
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,850
I know what to do.

310
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,285
They're in lockdown.

311
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:50,855
I know where Applewhite is.

312
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:53,758
You just need to get here
as soon as you can.

313
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,461

<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Jules, you good?</i>

All clear.

316
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,200
That's a lot of turnover.

317
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:05,802
Rose: Yeah, one of our
senior operations managers

318
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,437
moved on last year.

319
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:10,006
Got a better offer
and took his team with him.

320
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,475
That's him.

321
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:14,143
Rose: Xavier Dodd.
Ed: Let me see, let me see.

322
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:15,779
We had to let him go
four months ago.

323
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:17,781
Poor performance,
mental health issues.

324

You're gonna help me find them!

Xavier, I need you
to put the gun down now.

332
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,400
You, back up, or I'll shoot!

333
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,438
Tell those guys to stay out!

00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:58,418
Hey! Don't tell me
about filiform, okay?

340
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,853
I know about filiform.

341
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,087
Then you know that
at room temperature

342
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,222
filiform starts to vaporize.

343
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,857
Look.
Look at the pathogen meter.

344
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,358
We're already inhaling spores.

345
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,260
<i>If the exposure in here</i>
<i>crosses threshold level,</i>

346

<i>it's untreatable.</i>

00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,461
Then I guess you'd better
help me soon

348
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,696
rather than later.

349
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:11,898
We need to seal these samples
immediately.

350
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,232
Hey! What did I say?!

351
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,501
<i>Nobody moves,</i>

352
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,869
<i>nobody leaves</i>
<i>until I get what I want!</i>

353
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:18,237
That includes you!

354
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:24,152
Ben:
Sir.

355
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,286
Jules is in the line of fire.

356
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,955
<i>Subject has two hostages.</i>

357
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,223
Parker: What does he want?
<i>Ben: No clear demands yet.</i>

358
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,824
He was fired
for psychological reasons.

359
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,192
All right, I'll get a headset.

360
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,759
Greg, we are going
to the gun cage.

361
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:34,728
No, these are my people.
I need to know what's going on.

362
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:36,396
There's an exposed pathogen
that could become airborne.

363
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:37,530
What kind of pathogen?

364
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:38,665
Anthrax.

365
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,302
All right, forget the headset.

366
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,071
Have Spike patch audio/visual
into the briefing room.

367
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:45,739
Do it now. Right now.
Ben: Yes, sir.

368
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:47,440
Toth: Don't make me call for
an escort off SRU property.

369
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:49,008
Back off, Larry.

370
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:52,411
You know you're officially
under suspension.

371
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,247
Then I've got nothing
left to lose, do I?

372
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:55,681
If you do that,

373
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:56,849
you know your chances
of returning to duty...

374
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:57,950
My team needs me.

375
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,629
Spike? Eddie?
Can you hear me?

376
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:12,964
Boss.

377
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:14,065
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Okay, I've got visual and comm,</i>

378
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,101
I'm with you.

379
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:19,204
Jules: Xavier, can you tell
us what you want here today?

380
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:22,273
How do you know my name, huh?

381
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,241
What did they tell you?
What did they say?

382
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:26,543
They said that you worked here
and you were let go.

383
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:28,245
Spike: Four months ago.
Mental health issues,

384
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:30,948
unreliable work habits,
disparaging the company.

385
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:32,883
<i>Xavier:</i>
<i>Did they say I was unstable?</i>

386
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:34,584
Huh? Paranoid?!

387
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,287
They said you had
mental health issues.

388
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:40,423
Xavier: Ah! Physical health
not so much concern, huh?

389
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,125
<i>Rose: He was an excellent
employee, at first,</i>

390
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:43,526
<i>but then later</i>
<i>he became convinced</i>

391
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:45,861
that one of our vaccines
was making him sick.

392
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,096
His performance suffered,

393
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:48,364
his behaviour became erratic,

394
00:14:48,432 --> 00:14:50,300
and then he threatened
litigation.

395
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,101
<i>Dr. Applewhite had no choice</i>
<i>but to let him go.</i>

396
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:55,837
Ben, I need everything
you can find on this guy...

397
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:58,307
<i>family, home life,</i>
<i>medical records.</i>

398
00:14:58,374 --> 00:14:59,341
Copy.

399
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:00,809
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Boss?</i>

400
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,244
Hey, Spike, let me talk
to your contact there.

401
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:03,979
Rose, it's my boss.

402
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:08,550
Hi, Rose, my name is
Sergeant Greg Parker,

403
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,751
I'm at the SRU.

404
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,353
Is the man actually sick?

405
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:13,922
<i>Rose: His symptoms were
found to be psychosomatic</i>

406
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,757
and stress-related.

407
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:17,725
<i>Parker: Then why would
Xavier take RDA's vaccine?</i>

408
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:18,993
Rose:
Standard precaution.

409
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:20,394
He worked in
our biosafety zones.

410
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,029
Spike: Xavier was a
disposal specialist.

411
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,765
Yes.
It's a high-risk position.

412
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,799
He worked with infected
animal carcasses.

413
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,468
It says he was given
VVA-50,

414
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,203
a three-in-one vaccine
for anthrax,

415
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:31,005
botulism and smallpox.

416
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:34,175
Rose: Yes, all safe, approved,
and sold all over the world.

417
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:36,143
Okay, thank you, Rose.

418
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:40,014
Jules: Do you think
the company's vaccine

419
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:41,214
is what made you sick?

420
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:42,915
I know it did.

421
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,550
<i>Jules: And that's
why you're here today.</i>

422
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:46,453
Xavier: I'm here to get a sample
of the vaccine I was given.

423
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,321
I want my doctor to analyze it.

424
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:51,724
<i>Applewhite: VVA-50 has a shelf
life of one year, Xavier.</i>

425
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,193
There won't be any samples left
of the ba...

426
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,894
Xavier: You're lying!
You're lying!

427
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:56,562
<i>He's a liar!</i>

428
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,563
He's the chief researcher here;
He designs these vaccines.

429
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:00,599
He fired me personally.
He's accountable.

430
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,334
<i>He has every reason</i>
<i>to cover it up.</i>

431
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,935
Maybe I can check it out.

432
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,504
No offense, you I don't trust.

433
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,206
Them I don't trust.

434
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:08,540
<i>All right, Dr. Ouellette's</i>
<i>gonna be here any minute,</i>

435
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,175
then we're gonna
get some answers.

436
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:11,710
<i>Spike: Do you know this Dr.
Ouellette?</i>

437
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:14,545
Rose: Jack Ouellette.
He's an activist scientist.

438
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,981
Been crusading against
vaccine manufacturers for year.

439
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,883
And there's no remaining samples
to analyze?

440
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,018
No.

441
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:24,889
<i>Ed: Ben, let's get
Xavier's wife down here.</i>

442
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:25,923
We need to talk to her.

443
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:27,392
Ben:
Copy that.

444
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,326
Jules: Xavier, there's no
sample on the premises.

445
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:29,926
We checked it out.

446
00:16:31,362 --> 00:16:32,429
No...

447
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:34,498
<i>No...</i>

448
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,501
No! Why should I believe you?

449
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:39,169
<i>Applewhite:</i>
<i>You can check the records.</i>

450
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:41,038
That entire batch
will have been used

451
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:42,039
or discarded by now.

452
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:43,606
It'll be in the records.

453
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:45,041
I wanna see those records.

454
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:46,442
I want Ouellette
to see those records.

455
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,144
I want him to see everything!

456
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:50,146
<i>I wanna know exactly</i>
<i>what I was given!</i>

457
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:52,214
<i>I wanna know exactly</i>
<i>what was in it!</i>

458
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:55,717
Something you put inside me
made me sick.

459
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,120
I hear you.

460
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:02,524
Look at me.
I hear you, all right?

461
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:06,061
<i>Now, if RDA gives</i>
<i>Dr. Ouellette addresses,</i>

462
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:10,098
will you please let these people
finish their work here?

463
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,732
You make that happen,
you got a deal.

464
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,736
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Boss, Xavier's wife is here.</i>

465
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:16,871
Valerie Simmons?

466
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:22,376
Okay, we need to talk
over here.

467
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,612
No, no. This shouldn't be
happening.

468
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,747
They forced him
to take the vaccines.

469
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,015
You know that, right?

470
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,184
It was a condition
of his employment

471
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:31,552
when he started here...

472
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,053
<i>for his "protection."</i>

473
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,089
Compulsory vaccinations.
Just like the Gulf War soldiers.

474
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,292
Parker: Didn't work out too
well for some of them either.

475
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,626
Soon after that

476
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:41,994
he started getting
these muscle cramps,

477
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,263
spasms in his arms
and shoulders,

478
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,898
migraines.

479
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,933
RDA's in-house doctor
said that...

480
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,734
It was all in his mind,

481
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,336
like what he needed
was a better attitude.

482
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,506
But Xavier kept getting worse.

483
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,708
After they fired him,

484
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,277
we tracked down this doctor
who studies vaccines

485
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,512
and their side effects.

486
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,846
And this was Dr. Ouellette?

487
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,616
Yeah, and we went for
a second opinion.

488
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,588
Lou Gherig's disease.

489
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,923
I've ruled out pretty much
every other possibility.

490
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,292
Now, the EMG confirms it.

491
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,793
What is that, like a...

492
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,395
(Clears throat) Brain disease?

493
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:19,863
Over the next few years,

494
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:22,532
your motor functions
will continue to decline,

495
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,201
you'll lose control
of your movement.

496
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,403
<i>Valerie:</i>
<i>And there's...</i>

497
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:29,339
No...

498
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,341
<i>Ouellette: The ALS runs its
course in two to three years,</i>

499
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:32,875
sometimes more.

500
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:36,146
Um, then respiratory failure
sets in.

501
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:39,281
But his mind will be normal?

502
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:40,915
Even though you can't move
or speak,

503
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,151
it's still you in there.

504
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:47,256
Xavier:
Three years...

505
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:52,961
So let me ask you this,
this in-house doctor,

506
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,728
why didn't he discover the ALS?

507
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:56,997
Convenient, isn't it?

508
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:58,566
And you tried legal action?

509
00:18:58,634 --> 00:18:59,800
Three different lawyers.

510
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,202
They all said sorry
for your luck,

511
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,936
there's no proof
the vaccines made him sick.

512
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,873
That's why Xavier was trying
to get a sample for testing.

513
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,208
Why the gun?

514
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,442
He had no choice.

515
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,410
They weren't exactly
gonna let him

516
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:11,411
walk in the front Dr.

517
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:12,879
Oh, and he's dying.

518
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:16,449
You got that part, right?

519
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:17,784
Okay, I need to go to work here

520
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:18,818
and I just need you
to wait outside

521
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:20,420
with this officer, please.

522
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:22,055
It's okay.

523
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:25,191
<i>Parker: Xavier doesn't
have a lot to lose.</i>

524
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:27,259
It's gonna be tricky
working him down from this.

525
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:30,696
(Door closes)

526
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:31,863
Ed:
Dr. Ouellette?

527
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,466
He just called me on the phone.

528
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:36,768
I have nothing to do with this
man's actions here today.

529
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:38,304
Well, that's good.
So let me cut to the chase.

530
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:41,540
Could the vaccine have
caused Xavier's illness?

531
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:43,775
There's a preservative
that's used in some vaccines,

532
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:44,876
squalene,

533
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:46,611
that's recently
been linked to ALS.

534
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,847
I know RDA has experimented
with squalene in the past.

535
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:51,382
Rose: None of our squalene
vaccines ever went to market.

536
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,752
Okay, look, here's the deal.

537
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,188
Xavier wants you to go
through RDA's documentation

538
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,422
and to tell him whether or not
that vaccine is safe.

539
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,690
Can you do that?

540
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,759
If RDA will allow it,
absolutely.

541
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,260
Rose, you made that call?

542
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,162
Yes, I've cleared it
with our CEO...

543
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,964
but no documents
leave this building.

544
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:08,099
Ed:
Okay, Jules.

545
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:14,204
Xavier,
Dr. Ouellette is here.

546
00:20:14,271 --> 00:20:16,639
RDA gave him access
to their files.

547
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:17,974
How do I know?

548
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,943
<i>Ouellette:</i>
<i>Xavier, I'm right here.</i>

549
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,611
I'm gonna check into this
for you, all right?

550
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,214
<i>Make sure they gave you</i>
<i>what they said they gave you.</i>

551
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,949
<i>Xavier:</i>
<i>Okay, good. Good.</i>

552
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,984
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

553
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:30,753
Raf, see if you can find us
some different eyes in.

554
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:31,653
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>On it.</i>

555
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:32,921
Do you remember our deal?

556
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,995
Thank you.

557
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,329
<i>Applewhite: Okay, we've lost a lot of time.
We have to move fast.</i>

558
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:42,530
We need to put these babies
to bed.

559
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,738
Ed, got a window
behind the subject.

560
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:53,141
<i>Ed: Now, stay ready,</i>
<i>in case things go sideways.</i>

561
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,643
Rose: You can search our inventory
on the computer over there.

562
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,946
Backup hard copies filed under
vaccine number over there.

563
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:00,281
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Fast is good, doctor.</i>

564
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:02,448
Facts don't lie.
This won't take long.

565
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:11,357
Jules:
How you holding up?

566
00:21:11,425 --> 00:21:12,792
Xavier:
(Sighs)

567
00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:17,096
I'm dying.

568
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:18,631
I know.

569
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:20,166
I'm sorry.

570
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:23,269
Xavier: You know, first,
it was just small stuff.

571
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:26,237
My muscles started twitching
for no reason.

572
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:27,439
I got a little numbness
and tingling.

573
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:29,675
Didn't think anything of it.

574
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:32,911
But this disease,
it moves fast.

575
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:35,280
<i>Soon, I'm not gonna be able</i>
<i>to feed myself.</i>

576
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:37,949
I'm not gonna be able to move,

577
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:40,718
or dress,

578
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,722
or swallow.

579
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:47,558
Or speak.

580
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,395
<i>I can handle it, so can Val.</i>

581
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:54,532
I mean that's...
That's the way it is.

582
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:58,935
But Gracie...
(Tearing up)

583
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:02,605
She's gonna grow up
watching me lose control,

584
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:04,073
one piece at a time,

585
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:08,010
and waste away.

586
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:15,784
She's not even gonna remember
the sound of my voice.

587
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:21,089
You have ALS?

588
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:23,925
What?
Like you didn't know.

589
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:25,394
Als is very difficult
to diagnose.

590
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:27,363
I'm sorry our doctors
missed it.

591
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,929
I really had no idea.

592
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,432
<i>It's hereditary, right?</i>

593
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,534
Is there a member
of your family perhaps who...?

594
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,171
There isn't.
I thought you had work to do.

595
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:43,210
<i>Parker: Jules, Xavier's
living under a death sentence.</i>

596
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,745
<i>He's waging war against RDA.</i>

597
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:47,013
<i>Is the only thing</i>
<i>that's keeping him going.</i>

598
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:48,915
He needs validation.

599
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,618
Xavier, between me and you,

600
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:54,954
you don't strike me
as an unstable, paranoid man.

601
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:56,456
<i>More like somebody</i>
<i>who's trying to make sure</i>

602
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:59,393
<i>other people don't get sick</i>
<i>like you did.</i>

603
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,459
If I can prove that I'm right,

604
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:01,660
then the money from the lawsuit

605
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:02,828
will help take care
of Valerie and Grace.

606
00:23:02,896 --> 00:23:05,398
There's nothing else
that I can do for them.

607
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:08,133
Do you have a picture of her?

608
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,268
<i>Of Grace?</i>

609
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:27,318
(Machine beeps)

610
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:34,792
Look at those cheeks.

611
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,666
<i>How old is she?</i>

612
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:44,601
<i>Xavier:</i>
<i>She just turned three.</i>

613
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:48,138
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Aw, that's such a great age.</i>

614
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:52,675
She's adorable.

615
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:02,384
<i>Parker: De-escalating.
Nice, Jules.</i>

616
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:05,320
Facing the end of the road.
Sound familiar?

617
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:07,989
<i>Ed:All right,</i>
<i>we've got an answer.</i>

618
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:09,458
Xavier's not gonna like it.

619
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:11,092
Jules, you're in there,
it's your call.

620
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,429
If he escalates,
Sam and Raf move on your order.

621
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:15,430
Copy.

622
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:16,998
(Phone rings)

623
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,232
(Phone beeps on)

624
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,234
Yeah, Ouellette.

625
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:21,735
<i>Dr. Ouellette:</i>
<i>Xavier.</i>

626
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:23,571
I know this isn't the answer
you're hoping to hear.

627
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:26,206
<i>The vaccine is unrelated</i>
<i>to your ALS.</i>

628
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:27,441
(Breathes heavily)

629
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,845
That was, uh...
That was so quick.

630
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,447
I checked everything,

631
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,583
the ingredients list,
phased trial results,

632
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,816
safety records,

633
00:24:36,884 --> 00:24:38,685
chain of custody
right down to your dose.

634
00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:41,488
<i>I don't think the vaccine had</i>
<i>anything to do with your ALS.</i>

635
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:43,723
What're you saying?
You think there's no link?

636
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,091
<i>You're telling me</i>
<i>there's no link?</i>

637
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:47,026
I'm afraid not.

638
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:48,361
I'm sorry, Xavier.

639
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:49,996
That's impossible!

640
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,364
Come on, there's gotta be
some kind of mistake,

641
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:53,599
or they doctored the results
or something!

642
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,267
<i>Right?! Ouellette?!</i>

643
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:57,303
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Jules, I'm coming in.</i>

644
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,106
Okay, just give him a minute.
This is a lot to accept.

645
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:01,740
It's the only explanation!

646
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:04,510
Jules: Xavier, there is nothing
that happened here today

647
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:05,878
that cannot be undone.

648
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:08,047
No, no, no!
Listen, I'm not paranoid.

649
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,315
Okay, I've read about
these cover-ups, right?

650
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,916
They doctored their file

651
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:14,486
<i>or they deleted something,</i>
<i>or they paid people off.</i>

652
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:15,953
Applewhite: Xavier, you
got what you came for...

653
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:17,889
VVA-50 was his baby,

654
00:25:17,956 --> 00:25:19,290
of course he's gonna try
to protect it.

655
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:22,360
You've got the answer,
you need to face...

656
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:23,661
We can check it out, Xavier.

657
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:25,396
Drop your weapon.

658
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:26,363
<i>Xavier: There's no way</i>
<i>I would've got through</i>

659
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:27,831
<i>if they knew the real truth.</i>

660
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:29,766
Jules: Xavier, put
your weapon down now!

661
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:31,402
Xavier:
You did this to me.

662
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:32,802
<i>Jules: You drop your
weapon right now!</i>

663
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,204
<i>Xavier:</i>
<i>You lied to my face!</i>

664
00:25:34,272 --> 00:25:35,972
<i>And you can lie to me,</i>
<i>to my face?!</i>

665
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,175
Jules:
Drop your weapon right now!

666
00:25:38,243 --> 00:25:40,077
Jules: Drop your weapon!
Logan: You let him go!

667
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:41,544
<i>Jules: Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon right now!</i>

668
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:43,413
(Weapon fires, loud explosion)

669
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,813
Spike?

670
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:46,249
Lockdown should happen
automatically.

671
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:47,316
(Locks beep and clank)

672
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:48,884
Sounds like it just did.

673
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:50,586
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Jules! Jules!</i>

674
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:53,156
Jules!

675
00:25:53,223 --> 00:25:54,424
Jules, status!

676
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,351
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Come on, Jules.</i>

677
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:16,488
Jules, status.
What's your status?

678
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,956
(Moans) I'm okay.

679
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,095
(Moaning)

680
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:28,532
<i>Puncture wound.</i>
<i>There's a piece of shrapnel.</i>

681
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,767
It hit an artery.

682
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,068
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Keep pressure on it.</i>

683
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,536
We got injured,
I need to get in there now.

684
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:34,471
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Easy, Sam, easy.</i>

685
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:35,705
We gotta know
what we're dealing with here.

686
00:26:35,773 --> 00:26:37,540
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

687
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:39,142
Team?!

688
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:40,710
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Logan fired.</i>

689
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:41,944
We got a major spill.

690
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:43,546
The refrigeration unit
broke open.

691
00:26:43,614 --> 00:26:46,048
Rose: The bullet must have
hit the HP vapor generator.

692
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:47,317
How much filiform
was stored in there?

693
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:48,618
<i>Rose:</i>
<i>At least twenty units.</i>

694
00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:49,818
And at room temperature
it thaws, right?

695
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:52,087
And the spores become airborne.

696
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:54,290
Sam: The pathogen
meter's 900 and rising.

697
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:57,726
<i>Rose: The good news is the
lockdown itself accelerates the vent.</i>

698
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:00,529
<i>It should bring the pathogen</i>
<i>levels down under control.</i>

699
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:03,899
No, it won't.
The vents aren't on.

700
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:05,466
Spike: The venting system
must've been knocked off-line

701
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,201
when Xavier sabotaged
the power generator.

702
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:09,604
Ed: 'Kay, Raf I need you
in that vent room now.

703
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:11,406
I'm on my way.

704
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:12,674
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Ed, we gotta go in.</i>

705
00:27:12,741 --> 00:27:14,442
I'm suiting up now.

706
00:27:14,943 --> 00:27:18,346
<i>Spike: 1200 parts per
million and climbing.</i>

707
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:20,181
Come on, come on, come on.

708
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:22,248
Logan:
My leg!

709
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,984
I can't feel my leg!

710
00:27:26,788 --> 00:27:28,689
<i>Applewhite: It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.</i>

711
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:30,657
Logan:
(Whimpering)

712
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:31,891
<i>Xavier and Applewhite:</i>
<i>(Grunts of effort)</i>

713
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:34,361
<i>Logan:</i>
<i>(Screams in pain)</i>

714
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:36,029
(Gasps for breath)

715
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:42,935
<i>Applewhite: We're going
to have to reset it.</i>

716
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:45,037
Okay, keep her leg steady.

717
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:46,605
Hands here.
Here!

718
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:47,707
Okay...

719
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:50,242
Okay...

720
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,545
Logan:
(Shrieks from the pain)

721
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:57,014
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

722
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:11,829
I need to find something
for a splint.

723
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:15,699
Jules, can you hear me?

724
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:16,966
Mh-mm.

725
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:18,701
Sniper breathing, okay?

726
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,104
<i>Slow it down, and hold.</i>

727
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:25,107
Lower your heart rate,
you'll lose less blood.

728
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:31,247
<i>We're coming right in.</i>
<i>We'll get you soon, okay?</i>

729
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:35,517
<i>Ed: If filiform's inhaled,
what happens, Rose?</i>

730
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:36,852
If it's under a micron,

731
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,587
hits the bloodstream
with every breath.

732
00:28:38,654 --> 00:28:39,755
If you inhale
over the threshold,

733
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:41,322
there's no going back.

734
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:43,291
There's no real symptoms
at first, but...

735
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,092
But what?

736
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,460
Ultimately?

737
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:46,695
Severe respiratory problems,

738
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:47,996
your skin turns blue,
you vomit blood.

739
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:49,363
It's terminal.

740
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:51,499
Okay, under that threshold,
is it treatable?

741
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:52,900
With antibiotics.

742
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:54,234
Spike:
The threshold is?

743
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:56,404
Rose:
Anything over 2500's fatal.

744
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,306
2500.

745
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:01,141
Xavier, this is Ed Lane
with the SRU.

746
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:03,644
I need everybody
out of that room immediately.

747
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:04,878
<i>Let's just get you</i>
<i>some fresh air,</i>

748
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:06,112
and then I promise you

749
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,680
we will resolve
anything you need.

750
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:14,086
Where are you doing?

751
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:15,889
She needs help
to get out of here.

752
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,991
Jules: Xavier, we're
all leaving right now,

753
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,293
through the decontamination
chamber,

754
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,527
<i>one at a time.</i>

755
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,929
<i>Xavier:</i>
<i>No! (Fires gun)</i>

756
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,632
Nobody's leaving here
until I get some answers.

757
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,934
Jules:
The venting system is off-line.

758
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,637
You know the damage
that filiform does.

759
00:29:31,704 --> 00:29:33,772
<i>Xavier:</i>
<i>Why won't you admit it?!</i>

760
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,373
Applewhite: I'll admit anything,
anything that you want...

761
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,642
<i>Xavier:</i>
<i>I want you to tell the truth!</i>

762
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,812
But the truth is
you just got sick, Xavier.

763
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,481
It's terrible, it's unfair,
but it's not my fault.

764
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,318
He can't face the truth;

765
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,019
means accepting his own death.

766
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,655
<i>Toth: Now the crusade</i>
<i>he and Valerie are on</i>

767
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,256
<i>was all for nothing.</i>

768
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,491
(Whimpering)

769
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,726
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Maybe it's hard to hear,</i>

770
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,895
but maybe the vaccine
didn't make you sick.

771
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,230
How could you possibly
understand this?

772
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,566
This is your last chance!

773
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:03,700
Jules:
Do not raise your weapon!

774
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:06,302
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>Ed, I'm in the vent room.</i>

775
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,671
Talk to me, Raf.

776
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:09,137
It looks like
the whole thing's shut down.

777
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:11,306
Our best bet is to reinitialize
the system manually.

778
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:12,942
Ed: Doctor, I'm going to
ask you one last time

779
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:14,910
before I put any more
of my team in danger,

780
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:17,646
is there any possibility
that Xavier could be right.

781
00:30:17,714 --> 00:30:20,816
<i>Dr. Ouellette only if squalene were
present in the VVA-50's composition.</i>

782
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,785
But I'd have seen that
in the records.

783
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,586
<i>Spike: And hypothetically,</i>
<i>if there had been a cover-up?</i>

784
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:25,987
<i>Ouellette:</i>
<i>No. Not possible,</i>

785
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:27,021
<i>not without doctor in</i>
<i>the records.</i>

786
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:30,257
Not without employees
being aware.

787
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:33,361
Or employees being let go?

788
00:30:33,428 --> 00:30:35,162
What kind of employees?

789
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,631
Depends on the nature
of the cover-up.

790
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:38,199
What are you doing?

791
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:39,801
Spike: Operations manager?
Safety supervisor?

792
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:41,267
<i>Quality control inspector?</i>

793
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:42,569
If it were
a contamination issue,

794
00:30:42,637 --> 00:30:43,504
definitely.

795
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:45,105
There is no cover-up.

796
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:48,174
That many people were let go?

797
00:30:48,242 --> 00:30:49,275
Spike:
Last year.

798
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:50,878
The entire safety
operations team,

799
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:52,613
just before Xavier was hired.

800
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,049
Rose, you replaced
your entire safety department?

801
00:30:56,117 --> 00:30:58,250
What, did you get a result
you didn't like?

802
00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:59,485
As I said before,

803
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:00,720
our safety operations
manager left

804
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:02,688
and took his entire team
with him.

805
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:03,956
I was sorry to see them go.

806
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:05,491
Huh.

807
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,627
Spike, Eddie, think we need
another angle on this.

808
00:31:07,694 --> 00:31:08,861
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Copy.</i>

809
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:11,163
Ben, get me RDA's CEO
on the line.

810
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:13,632
Copy.

811
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:14,733
<i>Ed: Rose, if you're
protecting someone,</i>

812
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,367
now is the time to come clean.

00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:19,004
<i>Ben:</i>
<i>Boss, Dr. Bergan's on the line.</i>

814
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:21,907
Patch him through.
(Phone beeps on)

815
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:23,975
<i>Bergan: Sergeant, I understand</i>
<i>the situation at the lab</i>

816
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:25,577
still isn't resolved.

817
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,579
Parker: Yeah, your former
employee remains convinced

818
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:30,147
that one of RDA's vaccines
made him sick.

819
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:31,815
That's just not possible.

820
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:33,116
Doctor, I'm telling you,
a minute ago,

821
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,484
I would've agreed with you.

822
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:36,153
Excuse me?

823
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,922
<i>Parker: Dr. Bergan, are you

825
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,559
<i>Bergan:</i>
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

826
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:43,961
So, you're not aware
that your entire safety team

827
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,662
was replaced last year?

828
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:47,430
<i>Bergan: Rose told me
they moved on by choi..</i>

829
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:49,832
<i>Parker: And so she replaces</i>
<i>an entire safety department,</i>

830
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,601
and you don't even raise
an eyebrow?

831
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:53,469
<i>Bergan:</i>
<i>I trust Rose implicitly.</i>

832
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,171
<i>Her vision and leadership</i>

833
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:57,640
have single-handedly made

834
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,176
Dr. Bergen, I've got four lives
in jeopardy at your lab,

835
00:32:00,243 --> 00:32:02,143
I'm gonna need
your full cooperation here.

836
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:04,780
You have it, I promise you.

837
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:08,050
I'm taking you up on that.

838
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:12,588

(Jules whimpers)

840
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:20,527
Jules, slow your breath, okay?

841
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:23,898
Count it out,
keep your heart rate real low.

842
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:28,936

the safety team you replaced...

914

We disagreed about the risk,

917

and I gave them
a generous incentive to move on,

918
00:36:51,897 --> 00:36:53,231

a tainted vaccine,
