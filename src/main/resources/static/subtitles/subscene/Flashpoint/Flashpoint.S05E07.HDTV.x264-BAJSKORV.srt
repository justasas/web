1
00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:02,948
Okay, loser buys the coffee.

2
00:00:02,982 --> 00:00:04,116
You're on.

3
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:07,417
<i>All right.</i>

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,659
One.

5
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:17,995
One.

6
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:22,565
Two.

7
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:26,335
You remember how I
take my coffee, right?

8
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:28,838
Two.

9
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:38,380
Agh!

10
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:58,299
<i>Nice shot!</i>

11
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:02,269
You okay?

12
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:03,671
Yeah, I just...

13
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:06,674
I just couldn't get
my breath there.

14
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:10,177
That's 'cause you
shot in that wind.

15
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:12,345
Okay, so coffee.

16
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:15,082
Yeah,
double-double, you bet.

17
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:30,963
<i>You are
valuable to me out here,</i>

18
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,331
<i>and you wouldn't wanna know
what happens</i>

19
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:35,434
<i>if you talk to the police
about this conversation.</i>

20
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,228
I know Lainie Summers.

21
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:05,729
<i>If you ever wanna
see her again...</i>

22
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:08,232
<i>Oh, Elliot!</i>

23
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:27,750
This is a message
for Lainie Summers.

24
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:29,484
Lainie...

25
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:31,286
By the time you see this...

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,722
Um, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry?

27
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,458
But I wanted to thank you
for being so patient with me

28
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:39,494
and such a good friend...

29
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,463
But I can't handle this.

30
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:43,965
I'm sure you
wouldn't want to see her get hurt.

31
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,169
All I can tell you
is there's no other way.

32
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,904
I know you're the only one
who can understand

33
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,839
why I have to do this.

34
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:58,345
I'm so sorry, Lainie.

35
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,520
Hi, how are you?

36
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,554
Good.

37
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,655
Are we good for today?

38
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,623
Yes, yes, I have the results...

39
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:35,880
Not a sound.
You see the gun?

40
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:37,315
You'll be shot
if you try anything.

41
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:38,749
Are we clear?

42
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,651
I'll give you instructions
as we go.

43
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,553
Walk!

44
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:43,754
<i>So, Sam said that, uh,</i>

45
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,289
you went to your dad's place
this morning,

46
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,490
had a little round of "golf"?

47
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:47,725
Yeah.

48
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,459
Yeah, he said you made
a pretty sweet shot.

49
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:52,963
The wind was at, what, forty
with a three o'clock crosswind?

50
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,232
You make a shot like that,
usually we can't shut you up.

51
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:56,666
Greg, there's no
story here, all right?

52
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,068
It was a damn golf ball.

53
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:00,203
<i>Come on, Eddie.
Come on, what's goin' on?</i>

54
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:03,940
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

55
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,374
<i>There's a man trying to
break in across the street.</i>

56
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,508
23 Dittmar.

57
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:09,745
He's going in.

58
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:11,313
Oh my God, he's got a gun!

59
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:13,382
Team,
911 on a possible home invasion.

60
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:14,783
<i>23 Dittmar.</i>

61
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:16,518
Confirmed - one armed subject.

62
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:19,755
<i>Winnie, we're on it.</i>

63
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:20,856
All the way to the end.

64
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,061
<i>No, it turned out
to be some students</i>

65
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,264
<i>just playing a prank.</i>

66
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:33,101
<i>Yeah, I gave them a warning.</i>

67
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:40,274
Help!

68
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:41,375
Help!

69
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:46,713
Code white! I need backup!

70
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,782
Team one, we
got another hot call.

71
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,550
<i>Attempted abduction, U of T.</i>

72
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:51,718
I can re-up team two.

73
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:52,985
Yeah, hold off on that, Winnie.

74
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,420
<i>Sam, Spike,
what's your position?</i>

75
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:55,554
We're almost at the house.

76
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:56,588
<i>We're just arriving, boss.</i>

77
00:04:56,623 --> 00:04:57,756
All right, you stay on it.

78
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:59,691
Winnie, we'll take
the university call.

79
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:01,360
Keep team two on standby.

80
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:02,361
<i>Copy.</i>

81
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,266
He jumped in a car.
He went that way!

82
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,000
<i>- What kind of car?
- I don' know.</i>

83
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:10,468
White, a regular car.

84
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:11,903
You see a license plate?
Can you describe him?

85
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:14,039
Um, a white guy in a suit.

86
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,040
White car, no plates.

87
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:16,207
That's not a lot to go on.

88
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,343
He's long gone.
Let's check the house.

89
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:19,444
Ma'am, any shots fired?

90
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:20,845
Um, when he came out
of the house,

91
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,780
<i>he went to the garage,
and then it wouldn't open</i>

92
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,049
so he screwed, um, a...

93
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,682
what do you call it? -
A silencer on the gun,

94
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,584
and then he started
shooting at the lock.

95
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:28,685
Who lives here?

96
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,021
A single guy, Evan...
No, Elliot.

97
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,222
<i>We hardly know him.</i>

98
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,490
<i>He's super-quiet
and he keeps to himself.</i>

99
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:34,891
Sam, there's a
car running in here!

100
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,260
Wait here.

101
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,095
Winnie, call an ambulance
and find out who lives here!

102
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,163
<i>Copy.</i>

103
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,097
Elliot, are you in there?!

104
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,299
<i>Elliot, can you hear me?</i>

105
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,503
- Elliot?!
- All clear!

106
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,007
Bullet damaged the lock.

107
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,176
Ma'am, do these
garages have inside doors?

108
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,177
No.

109
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:55,244
Let's grab the halligans.

110
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,980
<i>Okay, EMS is on its way.</i>

111
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:58,413
<i>Homeowner's name
is Elliot Thaine.</i>

112
00:05:58,448 --> 00:05:59,882
He's a self-employed accountant.

113
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,917
This is Jules Callaghan,
I'm with the police!

114
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:03,619
We're here to help!

115
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:04,720
<i>You're gonna be okay!</i>

116
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:09,257
We're gonna get this door open!

117
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:11,594
Guys, this place is like
a blank slate.

118
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:13,228
No colour, no books,

119
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,564
nothing on the walls,
no photos.

120
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,832
Hang on.

121
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,502
Think I got something.

122
00:06:21,837 --> 00:06:23,538
The man who broke in,
did you ever seen him before?

123
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:24,739
No, he looked legit.

124
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:25,940
I mean, he was wearing a suit,

125
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:29,676
but I've never seen
a visitor there before.

126
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:30,744
Yeah.

127
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:33,480
Hold on.

128
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:34,781
You the one that was attacked?

129
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:35,782
Lainie Summers

130
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,150
sergeant Parker, officer Lane.

131
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,351
<i>The man had a gun?</i>

132
00:06:38,386 --> 00:06:39,486
- Yeah.
- I got close,

133
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:40,787
but he got into a crowd
of students.

134
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:41,822
<i>He's gone.</i>

135
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,189
Either of you
get a look at him?

136
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:45,291
Dark hair, maybe
six foot, dark clothes.

137
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,626
Any idea where
he was taking you?

138
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,328
No, I got-I got lucky.
I saw the guard.

139
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:51,063
She decked
him, you know, I jumped in...

140
00:06:51,097 --> 00:06:53,332
Some of the kids helped too.
I just... I don't know.

141
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,867
He didn't like the odds.
He just took off.

142
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:57,269
Okay, Winnie, we
need UNI's on campus.

143
00:06:57,303 --> 00:06:58,671
Sweep George street,
the quad...

144
00:06:58,705 --> 00:06:59,739
<i>Copy.</i>

145
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:01,640
Wanna give me a hand with that?

146
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:02,607
Miss Summers...

147
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,242
Doctor Summers.
Lainie's fine.

148
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:06,678
Lainie, any idea why someone
would try to abduct you

149
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,079
in broad daylight?

150
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:10,415
No, I have no idea.

151
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:19,289
It's okay,
Elliot, we got ya.

152
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:20,558
No...

153
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:25,195
How long has he been exposed?

154
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,463
Minimum ten minutes.

155
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,265
He needs oxygen,
non-re-breather mask.

156
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:29,666
All right, Elliot,
you're gonna be okay?

157
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:30,900
We need to get him to
the hospital, run tests.

158
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:33,103
That's a serious amount
of carbon monoxide.

159
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,404
Winnie, call 52,

160
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:35,972
get a detective
to the hospital.

161
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,874
We need to question him
when he pulls through.

162
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:39,609
Copy.

163
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:42,111
<i>Boss, your attempted
abduction, her name's Lainie Summers?</i>

164
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,645
Yes, Spike,
we're with her now.

165
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,115
Elliot Thaine left a
suicide message on his computer

166
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:47,683
and it was for her.

167
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,351
This message
is for Lainie Summers.

168
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:51,687
<i>He's apologizing.
He's visibly stressed.</i>

169
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,889
He's upset, saying goodbye.

170
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:57,226
There's just no other way,

171
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,127
and I hope you can understand.

172
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:00,228
<i>I'm sorry, Lainie.</i>

173
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:03,065
Lainie,
you know an Elliot Thaine?

174
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:04,633
Elliot?
Yeah, of course.

175
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,367
<i>Team one, we have
a hijacked ambulance,</i>

176
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,403
Lansdowne and Dupont.

177
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,205
Lansdowne and Dupont?
You're kidding me.

178
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,673
<i>That's just around the corner!</i>

179
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,674
Two gunmen.

180
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,909
Is one of them in a suit?

181
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:15,077
Left the attendants
on the side of the road

182
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:16,077
and took off with the patient.

183
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:17,178
It's gotta be him.

184
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,746
Elliot Thaine.

185
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,615
<i>- Sam, find that ambulance.
- Copy.</i>

186
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:21,616
How do you know Elliot?

187
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,783
I'm a neuroscientist.

188
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:24,285
<i>Elliot is a research subject
of mine.</i>

189
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,321
He's... He's a friend.

190
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:27,422
Why were you studying him?

191
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:28,823
Elliot, is...

192
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,425
He's one of a kind.

193
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,092
He has a rare kind
of hypermnesia.

194
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,393
He has exceptional memory?

195
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,929
More than
exceptional, it's perfect.

196
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:37,030
Limitless.

197
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,633
<i>Like I said, he's...</i>

198
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,635
He's one of a kind.

199
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,873
<i>Elliot, are you in there?!</i>

200
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:48,108
<i>It's okay, Elliot.
We got ya!</i>

201
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:49,643
<i>Elliot, can you hear me?!</i>

202
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:50,944
<i>We need to get him to
the hospital, run tests.</i>

203
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:53,079
<i>That's a serious amount
of carbon monoxide.</i>

204
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:54,514
<i>Elliot!</i>

205
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,887
Elliot, what were you thinking?

206
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:34,191

207
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:37,882
<i>Okay, team, the ambulance
is heading South on Dansdowne.</i>

208
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,784
<i>I've got transit and taxis
in on the APB,</i>

209
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:41,551
but the ambulance is running
lights and sirens.

210
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:42,653
Copy.

211
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,957
Are we clear?

212
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:49,960
Good.

213
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:51,095
You see,
nothing's gonna happen to her

214
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,797
as long as
you don't disappoint me.

215
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,470
All right, we're good.
Just make sure you stand...

216
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,274
<i>We don't have her.
There were complications.</i>

217
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:06,943
Yeah, well, isn't that a shame.

218
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:10,946
I don't think it's gonna make
much of a difference.

219
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,380
<i>Guys, Lakeshore and Jamison,</i>

220
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:13,982
<i>the ambulance is stopped
at the intersection.</i>

221
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,918
All right, Winnie,
lock off the traffic.

222
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:17,686
He tried to kill himself?

223
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,688
Yeah, I'm sorry. We
know that's hard to hear,

224
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,957
but maybe you can help us
understand why.

225
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,059
<i>And why someone
would wanna take him.</i>

226
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:30,898
One of the first tests
of his memory, I...

227
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:33,767
I gave him these pages.

228
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:35,303
Ma-na-ba-fa...

229
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:38,239
Meaningless random
syllables, four pages of them.

230
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:42,075
I read them to him
and he recited them back.

231
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,609
That was three years ago.

232
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:44,777
<i>Last week I asked him</i>

233
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,213
if he still remembered
the syllables.

234
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,380
And he did?

235
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,549
<i>Yup. Also the weather that day,</i>

236
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,417
what he'd had for breakfast,

237
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,785
that we drank ginger tea

238
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:55,255
<i>and I was a wearing
a peach-coloured shirt.</i>

239
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,226
<i>That's him.</i>

240
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,961
<i>That's quite a gift.</i>

241
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,929
Not the way he sees it.

242
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,965
<i>Our brains are conditioned
to forget selectively.</i>

243
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,000
We forget physical pain,
trauma.

244
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,134
It's how we cope.

245
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,503
We all take that for granted,
but...

246
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:12,804
<i>Elliot doesn't have
that luxury.</i>

247
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,172
What do you mean?

248
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,342
He lives with constant flashes
of intrusive memory.

249
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,910
<i>They fill every second
of his day.</i>

250
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,045
They can come at any time.

251
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,981
<i>He hears a car honk;</i>

252
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:24,648
<i>It doesn't just remind him
of one car,</i>

253
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,451
it reminds him of every car
he's ever seen.

254
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,120
<i>They all pop into his head
and they're all honking.</i>

255
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,554
That's why his home
is nearly empty...

256
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:32,655
the blank walls...

257
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,091
so he avoids
too much stimulation?

258
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:39,029
He stays away from smells,
sounds, bright colours...

259
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,463
People.

260
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:43,733
<i>He won't even open his blinds
at home.</i>

261
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:46,168
Medication,

262
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:48,804
meditation, hypnotherapy.

263
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,273
He can't control
what he remembers

264
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:51,908
or what he sees.

265
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:54,743
So these memories are triggered
by random, ordinary things?

266
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,079
Yup.

267
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:58,981
He had a hard childhood.

268
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,450
<i>Yeah, he faced a lot of loss,</i>

269
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:02,951
and everything
he's lived through,

270
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:05,620
it's with him from the moment
he opens his eyes

271
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:08,089
until when he goes
back to sleep.

272
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:09,724
All he wants is a little peace.

273
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:13,895
<i>Is that why he's suicidal?</i>

274
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,431
I knew that Elliot
was struggling with depression,

275
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:19,199
I just... I didn't realize
how serious it was

276
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:20,901
until a couple days ago.

277
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:24,238
Tequila? Seriously?

278
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:26,307
Yeah, I read
that if you have enough

279
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:29,276
you get a little numb,
you don't feel so much.

280
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,378
Play your cards right,
you might even black out.

281
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:34,647
Ell, you're 30-years-old

282
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,549
and you've never tried Tequila?

283
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,450
Why? Have you?

284
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:38,551
Oh jeez.

285
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:39,986
Yeah?

286
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:42,388
There was a party.
I was about 18-years-old.

287
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:44,890
My parents were out of town.

288
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,161
It involved me climbing up
onto the baby grand

289
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:49,462
and singing show tunes.

290
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,797
<i>Very loud.</i>

291
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:55,033
It was great until
the piano cover cracked

292
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:57,202
and I got grounded
for six months.

293
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,803
I wish I could have seen that.

294
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:00,839
No, you don't.

295
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:03,608
<i>When I heard
how much he was hurting...</i>

296
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:05,844
I didn't know what to do,
you know?

297
00:13:05,878 --> 00:13:07,111
I'm...

298
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:09,713
I'm not a therapist,
I'm a researcher.

299
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:13,517
So this was last night,
and what happened?

300
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:18,055
Well, at first,
I thought it was working,

301
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,756
everything sort of slowed down.

302
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:22,692
<i>I didn't "see" so much,</i>

303
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,328
and then the whole room starts
spinning and tipping

304
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:26,729
and I got sick,

305
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:32,335
and the taste
and the smell and...

306
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:34,670
And now that's locked in.

307
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:36,039
It's another thing locked in.

308
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:37,474
It's so stupid, Lainie!

309
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,376
I'm sick,

310
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:41,676
I'm in pain, I need treatment,

311
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:45,014
and there isn't any
and there never will be...

312
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:47,816
And there's nowhere safe
for me,

313
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:50,986
not even at home.

314
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:54,322
<i>I'm a friend...</i>

315
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,523
And I should've been there
for him.

316
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,957
Lainie, don't blame yourself.

317
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:57,958
He may be suicidal,

318
00:13:58,027 --> 00:13:58,993
but something else tipped him

319
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:00,994
over the edge today.

320
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:02,496
<i>We're approaching
the ambulance.</i>

321
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:03,563
<i>Copy that.</i>

322
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,770
Why would they just stop?

323
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:12,605
This is the police
strategic response unit!

324
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,307
Throw your weapons out
of the vehicle

325
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,411
and step out with your hands
where we can see them!

326
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:19,678
Let's move in.

327
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:25,484
This is the police!
Come out right now!

328
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:39,664
On
three, two, one.

329
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:43,435
No one's in there, Ed.

330
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:44,936
Elliot's not in the ambulance?

331
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:47,638
No, they left it as
a distraction to stall us.

332
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:49,941
Elliot's long gone.

333
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:52,409
Okay, let's break this down.

334
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:53,544
Who breaks into a house,

335
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:55,145
carjacks an ambulance
in broad daylight...

336
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,346
go to all this trouble

337
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:57,848
just to get their hands on a...

338
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:01,652
On a human camera?

339
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:04,188
Elliot drew the rosetta stone?

340
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:06,056
He saw it at the British
museum when he was eight.

341
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:08,725
He drew it from memory
when I met him.

342
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,061
That's ancient Egyptian,
demotic script, ancient Greek.

343
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:12,562
It's a flawless replica.

344
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,464
So Elliot remembers
words, numbers, patterns...

345
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:15,632
<i>Everything.</i>

346
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,933
Even in languages
he doesn't understand.

347
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,101
So you could send him somewhere

348
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:20,003
and he could absorb
information undetected,

349
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:21,670
somewhere you couldn't
bring a camera.

350
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:22,805
<i>You said he was reclusive.</i>

351
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,473
Who else would know
he could do this?

352
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,177
Oh, we did an interview
on "enquiring minds,"

353
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,946
<i>the TV news magazine.</i>

354
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:33,215
They featured this drawing.
I mean, it could be anyone.

355
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,184
<i>Hey, you look good, Elliot,</i>

356
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:39,386
<i>but today your name
is Gregory Cook, okay?</i>

357
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:40,688
<i>Now, like I said,</i>

358
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,456
they're gonna show us
the security room, okay?

359
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,758
I need you to study
the floorplans

360
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,760
and make sure that
they match the camera angles.

361
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,161
Also, we're gonna be nice and easy.

362
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:48,063
We're gonna go in,
we're gonna go

363
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,450
for the target, work fast,
and get out.

364
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:51,994
Yeah.

365
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,037
Meet us at the doors
in 15 minutes.

366
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,447
Stay out of sight, ok?

367
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,222
Until then, yeah.
Eyes open.

368
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,006
I can't. I don't think I can...

369
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,373
Hey, hey!

370
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,075
You can, Elliot.

371
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,844
You can, okay?

372
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:06,747
Come on, okay?

373
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:19,324
Looks like they were too busy
to disengage the cameras.

374
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:22,427
It means we have a
rear and an inside view.

375
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:23,595
Yup.

376
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,664
Hang on, Elliot,
won't be long.

377
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:32,336
Barnaby Howe,
senior projects manager.

378
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:33,638
We spoke on the phone.

379
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:34,939
Yeah, we were just
talking to each other

380
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,775
about how grateful we are
for your co-operation.

381
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:37,776
Absolutely.

382
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:39,544
Keep us on our toes.

383
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,181
Government compliance officers.

384
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:46,583
We've got another
security spot-check.

385
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:47,851
Any metal objects
on the tray, please.

386
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,053
Oh.

387
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,554
This scanner's
state-of-the-art,

388
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:53,423
picks up even
the smallest metal mass.

389
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:04,667
Arms out.
Hold still, please.

390
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,973
<i>Clear. Proceed.</i>

391
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,141
Mm-hmm.

392
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:15,744
<i>Please hold still, sir.</i>

393
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,417
Clear. Proceed.

394
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:23,819
<i>Howard, you'll be our escort.</i>

395
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,624
Security compliance check.

396
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,695
Attention all staff.

397
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,830
We have government security
compliance officers

398
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,098
with us today.

399
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:39,133
Please give them
your full co-operation.

400
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,235
Thank you.

401
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,105
I won't cramp your style.

402
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:45,606
Catch you on the way out.

403
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,307
Appreciate it.

404
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:55,982
<i>Uh, gentlemen, I
just wanted to say</i>

405
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,052
<i>we've had some grave concerns
in regards to...</i>

406
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:20,372
Hello! We got a face.

407
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:22,641
Winnie, Spike's sending you
a picture of Elliot's abductor.

408
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:24,242
Anything you can find.

409
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,278
We've also got an image
on the bumper cam, Winnie.

410
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:30,014
They switched into a grey van,
marker 6-8-9 4-T-M.

411
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:33,484
Okay, I'll run the photo
and put an APB out on the van.

412
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:34,818
What kind of information
is worth the risk

413
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:36,019
these guys are taking?

414
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:37,588
Information
worth a lot of money.

415
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:38,455
Whatta you got, boss?

416
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,757
Okay, team,

417
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,525
Elliot's got an extraordinary
phographic memory.

418
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,727
We're thinking where would
you need a guy like that?

419
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:45,496
You can get micro-cameras
the size of a freckle.

420
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,531
Why would you use a human,
an unwilling one?

421
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:49,532
A human gets past
metal detectors.

422
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,866
So somewhere with
tight security,

423
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:51,967
no photos.

424
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:53,369
Maybe government, military?

425
00:18:53,404 --> 00:18:54,771
<i>Team one, the
licence plates on that van</i>

426
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,773
are officially bogus.
It's a dead end,

427
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:58,775
but we do have a match
on our hijacker.

428
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,242
Go, Winnie.

429
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,044
<i>Jay Penak. He's
on the federal watchlist.</i>

430
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,212
He's a frequent flier,

431
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:05,480
especially to Eastern Europe
and China.

432
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:06,815
<i>He's well-connected</i>

433
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,149
and he's known to have contacts
with arms dealers.

434
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:09,851
Of course, weapons.

435
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:22,229
Don't say anything.

436
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,201
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

437
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:32,940
Okay, we got three private
companies that do research

438
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:37,510
A.G.S. Loeb, Brebtech,
and Morton & Floyd.

439
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:38,845
<i>Okay, I'll get
unmarked cars to all three,</i>

440
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,913
eyes peeled for the van.

441
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:45,985
Okay, the blind spot,
the blind spot,

442
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:46,986
which way?

443
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:49,088
Uh...

444
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:51,524
We gotta pass two cameras.
Third door on the right...

445
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:53,660
Just show me, just show me!
Let's go!

446
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,562
Grey van's been sighted
near Tomken and Brittania.

447
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,763
And that's right near...?

448
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:58,865
A.G.S. Loeb.

449
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,734
- Let's move!
- Let's do it.

450
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,742
Come on in and I'll
review our security protocol.

451
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:10,808
Okay.

452
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,477
Everything's by the book.

453
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,079
You know there was that
near-breach last year.

454
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,180
Yes, we know.

455
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,581
We tightened everything up.

456
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,850
It's impossible for information
to leave the premises,

457
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,952
<i>physically or virtually.</i>

458
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,820
<i>There are no hard copies
of the research,</i>

459
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,990
no ports in the computers,

460
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,758
and there's no wireless signal
within the facility walls.

461
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,593
So, we're unhackable.

462
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,761
We know.

463
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:34,131
This shouldn't take long.

464
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,799
They have a contract
with the department of defense

465
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,868
to build a smart gun system.

466
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,936
Details are classified,

467
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,704
but they use
self-guided bullets.

468
00:20:40,738 --> 00:20:42,972
<i>Yeah, the military's been
testing prototypes for a while.</i>

469
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,141
They get this right,
it's the perfect firearm.

470
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:46,642
Meaning what exactly?

471
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:48,644
<i>Meaning it will hit
every target every time.</i>

472
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:50,579
Meaning anybody
who gets his hands on it

473
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:53,249
will think he's an unstoppable
killing machine.

474
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,318
So if tech like
this hits the street...

475
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:56,786
<i>You think gang
wars are bad now?</i>

476
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,388
Wait until they have
the firepower of an army.

477
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:01,089
Greg, it's not gonna matter
how hard we train.

478
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:03,459
If we start going up against
guys with this kind of force...

479
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,994
I know,
Eddie, let's move!

480
00:21:18,106 --> 00:21:20,041
<i>Mr Howe, this is Ed Lane, SRU.</i>

481
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:22,009
Sir, we believe there
are unauthorized personnel

482
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:23,244
<i>on your premises</i>

483
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:25,413
<i>looking to access
classified information.</i>

484
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:26,448
That's not possible.

485
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:27,682
Sir, could you check your logs,

486
00:21:27,716 --> 00:21:29,551
tell me if there are
any unfamiliar personnel

487
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:32,252
entering the facility
within the last half hour.

488
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:34,120
We have two security
compliance inspectors,

489
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:35,422
but they were fully accredited.

490
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:36,590
Are they still in there?

491
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:37,791
<i>I'll find out.</i>

492
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:41,795
One-one-five, come in.

493
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:45,265
One-one-five, priority!

494
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:54,540
<i>How's it going?</i>

495
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:56,308
Almost done.

496
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:58,010
This is everything, right?

497
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:00,179
All the notes, test results,
updates?

498
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:02,247
Everything, I swear to God.

499
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:05,083
So where do you keep
the prototype?

500
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,417
I said where?

501
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:07,486
In the lockup.

502
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:08,620
Show me.

503
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,697
Ed, Sam, Jules, we're going in.

504
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:21,365
Keep your eyes open
for the van.

505
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:22,800
Copy.

506
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:24,101
What's goin' on?

507
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,803
My escort's not responding.
They may have his gun!

508
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:26,871
Okay.

509
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:42,519
Ammo?

510
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:43,553
Which way?

511
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:44,721
Here.

512
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:45,889
Is there a
phone in that room?

513
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:47,156
Yeah, hard-wired.

514
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,125
Call it, please.

515
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,562
I want you to show
me how this works.

516
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:01,036
Tell me how this works.

517
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:02,070
Uh...

518
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:03,271
Tell me.

519
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:04,640
You get a lock on your target

520
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:05,974
with the laser sight.

521
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,508
It charts a path
for the bullet,

522
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:09,376
the bullet auto-corrects
in flight.

523
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:10,912
No answer.

524
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:13,180
What if my
target's behind cover?

525
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:16,150
You take your reading
from the obstruction,

526
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:19,020
manually adjust the distance
one yard or two.

527
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:20,888
You adjust your position,

528
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:22,622
the gun measures
the change of angle

529
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,558
<i>based on the original
laser reading.</i>

530
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,961
<i>You fire,
the bullet corrects its path,</i>

531
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:31,064
<i>you hit the target
behind the obstruction.</i>

532
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,000
I gotta tell ya,
that's something else.

533
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:36,269
Are you done, Elliot?

534
00:23:38,238 --> 00:23:39,271
Elliot!

535
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,140
I'm done.

536
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,910
This is your brain child, huh?

537
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:47,580
No one knows this stuff
like you?

538
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:49,281
That's right.

539
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:50,049
That's good.

540
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:54,519
Shot fired! Go, go, go!

541
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,353
Let's go.

542
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:57,354
Now!

543
00:23:57,422 --> 00:23:59,390
<i>Or Lainie's next!</i>

544
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,105
Trevor was our lead researcher.

545
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:11,874
This is how Jay Penak
deals with competition?

546
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,311
Where are your weapons kept?

547
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,519
He's got the XC-2 prototype.

548
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,019
Silver lining.
Elliot's safe.

549
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:25,487
As long as he's got
those schematics,

550
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:26,888
they won't let anything
happen to him.

551
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:27,989
Yeah, but now they'll do
whatever it takes

552
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,157
to get him to the finish line.

553
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:30,426
Spike, let's get eyes.

554
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:31,660
We gotta get 'em
before they leave the building.

555
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:33,128
Your security, which way?

556
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:34,230
Follow me.

557
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,867
No one saw them
enter the secure room

558
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,201
or access the research?

559
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:41,703
No cameras in that room.

560
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:43,204
Security reasons.

561
00:24:45,107 --> 00:24:46,774
Did they get access
to the facility's floorplans

562
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:48,443
or the CCTV system?

563
00:24:48,477 --> 00:24:50,044
The security room
was their first stop.

564
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:51,812
Guys, Elliot saw the floorplan.

565
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,147
They got an advantage.

566
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,349
They're gonna know
every square inch of this place.

567
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:55,449
Well, at least they can't
get the schematics

568
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:56,483
out of the building.

569
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:59,353
Actually, they can.
Long story.

570
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:01,688
They're gonna avoid the
cameras in the main hallways.

571
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:03,390
<i>Spike, what about
service corridors?</i>

572
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:04,758
Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.

573
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,394
Boss, you go straight ahead,
you turn left.

574
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:08,662
<i>Attention all employees.</i>

575
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:10,964
This is
the Strategic Response Unit.

576
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:12,831
<i>Please leave all open areas
immediately.</i>

577
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:14,133
Damn it! Let's go!

578
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,268
<i>Remain behind locked doors</i>

579
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:17,202
<i>until we give you
the all-clear.</i>

580
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:19,372
Okay, this facility's
got four exits.

581
00:25:19,406 --> 00:25:21,474
<i>You got two exits
on the South side.</i>

582
00:25:21,508 --> 00:25:24,143
So Elliot and Jay,
they're headed here or here.

583
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,379
Ed, service corridor C.

584
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:28,980
We don't know if he's going
to the east or the west exit.

585
00:25:29,014 --> 00:25:30,515
I'll back you up.

586
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:33,918
<i>Leah, west exit with the boss.
I'll take the east.</i>

587
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,919
But the police are...

588
00:25:34,953 --> 00:25:36,087
Just keep movin'!

589
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:37,155
Which way?

590
00:25:39,258 --> 00:25:40,292
Come on!

591
00:25:50,168 --> 00:25:51,234
Which way?

592
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:54,171
Which way?

593
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,144
I can't do this anymore.

594
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:03,846
East exit. Which way?

595
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:05,348
I'm sorry, I can't see it.

596
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:06,849
You start seein' it or
Lainie Summers is gonna die,

597
00:26:06,883 --> 00:26:08,318
<i>do you hear me?</i>

598
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:13,189
East exit!

599
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:16,991
<i>Elliot...
Elliot, what are you doing?</i>

600
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,293
<i>Think braniac! Come on!</i>

601
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:20,161
<i>For God sake,
we're out of time!</i>

602
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:21,763
<i>Focus!</i>

603
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:23,732
<i>Elliot,
you need to listen to me.</i>

604
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,967
<i>You need to listen to me
right now.</i>

605
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:28,136
<i>What are you doing?</i>

606
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:30,505
It's that way.

607
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:32,573
Good. Okay, go! Go, go!

608
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:34,442
What can you tell
me about this smart gun?

609
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,976
Well, the bullet
has an onboard chip

610
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:37,378
and the gun has a laser sight.

611
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:38,746
The gun tells the bullet
where to go.

612
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,581
How?
By radio signal.

613
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,050
<i>Vehicle's approaching
the delivery door,</i>

614
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:44,618
black Alpha two.

615
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,886
We'll stand by to intercept.

616
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,620
There. East exit, Ed!

617
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:49,188
Which way, Spike?

618
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:51,591
Boss, Leah, you guys go
straight past the loading bay,

619
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,326
then you go left.
Ed's nearly there!

620
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,362
Let's flank him.
He won't know what hit him.

621
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:57,163
Copy. Ed, we're
right behind you.

622
00:26:57,197 --> 00:26:58,264
On my go.

623
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:12,578
He's here.

624
00:27:15,248 --> 00:27:16,415
<i>Please don't hurt anybody else.</i>

625
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:18,149
You have me.
You have everything you need!

626
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:20,017
<i>Don't, please! Please!</i>

627
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:21,619
Put the weapon down!

628
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:31,061
No.

629
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:32,162
Ed, status.

630
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:34,331
Come on.

631
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:39,469
<i>Spike, can you
get eyes in there?</i>

632
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:41,137
Ed's hit.
Boss, I don't have a visual!

633
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:44,374
Eddie.

634
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,175
Come on, buddy, talk to me.

635
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,050
Okay, Jay,

636
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:56,285
I'm sergeant Parker
with the police.

637
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,120
I just want to know
if my guy's all right.

638
00:27:58,154 --> 00:27:59,422
Step back!

639
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:00,423
<i> Eddie.</i>

640
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:01,557
I'm okay.

641
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:08,362
Hey, stay
calm and cuff him.

642
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:12,700
<i>Sam, Jules, move in on the van.</i>

643
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,305
Moving in on the van!

644
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,242
Police! Drop it!

645
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:22,544
Don't even think about it!
Drop it now!

646
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,311
On the ground now!
Drop your weapon now!

647
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:25,312
Hands where I can see them!
On the ground!

648
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,380
Drop it! Drop it!

649
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:30,417
Hey, Jay,
you got what you came for.

650
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:32,953
Now all I'm asking you to do
is walk away from that officer.

651
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:34,788
No, he's comin' with us!

652
00:28:34,823 --> 00:28:36,122
Anything or anybody
gets in the way

653
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,825
and I'm gonna kill him!

654
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,028
Come on, let's get him up!
Stand him up.

655
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:45,431
You're gonna have to call off
your reinforcements

656
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:46,866
and give us clear passage,
do you hear me?!

657
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,867
Stay with us, stay with us.

658
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,268
We'll find a way.

659
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:54,474
<i>You hear me?!</i>

660
00:28:54,508 --> 00:28:57,976
Okay, team, stand down. Leah.

661
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:00,979
<i>Sam, Jules,
team one stand down.</i>

662
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,081
Boss, say again?

663
00:29:03,115 --> 00:29:06,284
<i>Stand down,
you heard him.</i>

664
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,887
Yes, sir.

665
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,421
All right,
you've got clear passage!

666
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,990
Let's go! Get the door!

667
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,762
All right, let's go.

668
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,864
Go.

669
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:27,971
Let's go.

670
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:29,572
<i>What's the plan, boss?</i>

671
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,474
<i>The threat to Ed is real.
We co-operate for now.</i>

672
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:34,511
<i>We're not taking that chance.</i>

673
00:29:38,382 --> 00:29:39,382
All right!

674
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:41,885
Come on, get in there!

675
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:43,252
<i>Let's go!</i>

676
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:50,993
<i>Sam, let's get
a GPS on that van!</i>

677
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,360
I'm on it!

678
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:04,572
You got it!

679
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,007
Let's go.

680
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,040
They're four blocks away.
Let's move!

681
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:12,475
The second
they see us interfere,

682
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:14,343
we've got a serious risk to Ed.

683
00:30:14,378 --> 00:30:16,212
We keep our distance,
we plan on the fly.

684
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:19,482
<i>Picked up some collateral,
but no one's gonna interfere.</i>

685
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,583
It'll work.

686
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,486
Oh my God.

687
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,686
Breathe, Elliot, breathe.

688
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:26,087
My God, he's
dead, he's dead.

689
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:27,656
Just breathe. My
God, he killed him.

690
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,857
<i>Elliot, Elliot, just breathe-
No talking!</i>

691
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:30,659
I'm just trying
to calm him down.

692
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:31,860
You heard me.
He's dead.

693
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:33,128
What're you gonna do?
You gonna shoot us?

694
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:34,663
Let me just talk to him.
I'm gonna calm him down.

695
00:30:34,697 --> 00:30:37,533
<i>You need him calm,
so let me talk.</i>

696
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:38,600
Elliot, listen to me.

697
00:30:38,668 --> 00:30:39,701
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

698
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,469
All I wanted to do,
all I wanted was...

699
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:45,139
you just wanted to forget.
I understand.

700
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:46,574
Elliot, I know about
your condition

701
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:50,210
and know how difficult
this is for you.

702
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:51,712
Now, son,
I don't have what you have,

703
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:55,282
but tell me
if this sounds familiar.

704
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:58,017
Sometimes I'll be doing
something ordinary

705
00:30:58,052 --> 00:31:01,988
and for no reason at all
I see something

706
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:05,191
and I remember a girl
that I saw die

707
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:07,193
and the images flood my mind
and I can't control it.

708
00:31:07,227 --> 00:31:08,628
It just happens, Elliot.

709
00:31:08,663 --> 00:31:10,630
I could be lookin'
at a coffee pot

710
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:12,432
or a golf ball...

711
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,333
And one thing just flips over
into the next thing

712
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:17,402
and everything takes you
some place you don't wanna be.

713
00:31:17,437 --> 00:31:19,137
And the more you try
not to think about it

714
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,439
the worse it gets.

715
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:23,342
Yeah, yeah.
Everything you've done,

716
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:26,111
everything you should
have done...

717
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:28,746
Everybody that you lost, right?

718
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:30,782
Yeah.

719
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:35,887
Yeah? We're en route.

720
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:38,590
So what happened here
with these guys?

721
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:40,825
Uh, two days ago,
guy comes to my door.

722
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,628
He said he knew a lot about me,

723
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:45,929
<i>and he said he wants me
to do a simple job for him</i>

724
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:47,598
<i>for a crazy amount of money.</i>

725
00:31:47,632 --> 00:31:49,600
<i>He didn't tell me
what the job was.</i>

726
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:51,234
No, thank you.

727
00:31:51,268 --> 00:31:52,503
Are you sure?

728
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,005
I mean, come on, Elliot,
think about the freedom.

729
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,106
You take a long holiday

730
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,708
and visit that
Rosetta Stone again.

731
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:58,775
No, thank you.

732
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:00,143
All right, fine.

733
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,344
Then I'll double my offer

734
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:02,278
and that'll give you a chance
to buy back

735
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:04,047
<i>the old family cottage.</i>

736
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:05,382
You see, Elliot, I know you.

737
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,683
I've done my research.

738
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:11,354
You've very valuable
to me, Elliot.

739
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:14,257
I know Lainie Summers.

740
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:18,460
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to see her get hurt.

741
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:19,828
And I know you're not gonna
want to know what happens

742
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,399
if you tell the police
about this conversation.

743
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:27,503
<i>And so he says he's
glad that I see things his way.</i>

744
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,770
He said he had to make
preparations

745
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:31,706
and he would be back
at 11 A.M. today to get me.

746
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:33,707
By which time you'd be dead.

747
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:36,010
Ed, I couldn't let anything
happen to her.

748
00:32:36,078 --> 00:32:37,378
I wouldn't let them touch her.

749
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:38,579
She's the only one
I trust with everything...

750
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:40,981
the truth, okay?

751
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,983
I would do anything
to keep her safe.

752
00:32:43,052 --> 00:32:45,019
You know what I'm remembering?

753
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,555
I remember a girl
in a peach-coloured shirt

754
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,856
and the taste of ginger tea.

755
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,224
What, you mean she's, she's...

756
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:52,325
Shh...

757
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:55,028
No, it's not a problem.

758
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:57,197
<i>We're gonna cover it with cash.</i>

759
00:32:57,265 --> 00:32:58,532
She's all right,
and I'm pretty sure

760
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,666
she'd want to see you
in one piece,

761
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:03,336
so help me get out
of this now, okay?

762
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:04,637
Just focus.

763
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,974
<i>They're heading
northwest, city limits.</i>

764
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:10,876
<i>If I were Jay
and money's no object?</i>

765
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,711
I'd take a flight out
under the radar,

766
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:13,779
take Elliot with me,

767
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:15,181
download somewhere safe.

768
00:33:15,215 --> 00:33:17,015
Any chance they're
heading toward an airport?

769
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,817
They just took a right.
If they keep going straight

770
00:33:18,885 --> 00:33:20,519
they're gonna end up
in Buttonville.

771
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:22,287
<i>That's a commuter airport.</i>

772
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:23,488
Private flights.

773
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:24,855
They can puddle-jump anywhere
from there.

774
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:26,324
I'll make the call.

775
00:33:33,932 --> 00:33:35,333
What's wrong?

776
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,767
He's having a seizure!
He's having a seizure!

777
00:33:36,802 --> 00:33:38,335
You have to give him
his medication!

778
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:43,240
Don't move and don't talk!

779
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:47,244
Help me with the cuffs.
Give me your tie.

780
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,446
Not a word.

781
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:50,780
<i>I just talked to Buttonville.</i>

782
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:53,083
There's a private plane
permitted to the airfield.

783
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:54,317
<i>It's scheduled to leave
in ten minutes.</i>

784
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,425
<i>- Scarlatti.
- Spike, it's Ed.</i>

785
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:03,692
Ed, talk to me.

786
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:05,128
Where are we going?

787
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:05,995
<i>Pretty sure you're
headed to Buttonville</i>

788
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:07,330
for a flight out.

789
00:34:07,364 --> 00:34:08,364
<i>All right, we took
out the babysitter.</i>

790
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:09,698
I got his gun.

791
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:10,966
Jay still has
the trump card here.

792
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,067
What do we know?

793
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,468
The weapon they took
is a prototype

794
00:34:13,503 --> 00:34:15,137
of an earlier work-in-progress.

795
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:16,739
We have got to disable
that gun.

796
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:18,240
I've got the specs.

797
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:19,975
That's right, you do.

798
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,710
Can you disable it remotely?

799
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:22,945
I don't know.
I mean, it's all in my head,

800
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:25,114
but I don't understand
most of it.

801
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,714
<i>Okay, Spike,</i>

802
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:29,350
talk to Elliot,
see if we can narrow this down.

803
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:30,852
Go.

804
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:33,054
<i>The bullet and the
gun talk to each other</i>

805
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,455
on a radio frequency.

806
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,091
We can't stop him firing,
but if we override the signal

807
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:38,893
we can take the "smart"
out of the bullet.

808
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:41,062
Okay, Elliot, any reference
to radio frequency,

809
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:42,429
radio guidance?

810
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:44,465
Uh...

811
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:48,636
Uh...

812
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,837
<i>Are you sure?</i>

813
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:51,938
I'm
so sorry, Lainie.

814
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,574
What's going on, Elliot?

815
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,509
I'm, I'm trying.
I'm sorry, I'm trying.

816
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:57,645
It's okay, it's okay,
you can do this.

817
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,046
We need the specific
channel that the gun uses

818
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:02,848
to communicate with the bullet.

819
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:09,989
<i>"Rp-4280/
results of phase three tests</i>

820
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:11,257
<i>to radio guidance system."</i>

821
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,493
Good work, good work. Spike?

822
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,894
We're looking for a
number, a megahertz range,

823
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:18,163
somewhere between 100 and 150.

824
00:35:22,935 --> 00:35:24,736
I can't see it.

825
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:27,138
Maybe not
MegaHertz, maybe MHz.

826
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,141
Uh...

827
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:33,877
Elliot, just breathe,
slow it right down.

828
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,717
<i>That's it, that's it, that's it.
You got it.</i>

829
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,486
<i>There you go.</i>

830
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:46,090
<i>Here.</i>

831
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:47,890
MHz. 122.8.

832
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:51,160
The bullet receives its signal
at 122.8 MHz.

833
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:53,029
Nice. Spike?

834
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:55,732
<i>122.8, 122.8, 122.8.</i>

835
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:57,934
Nice! Nice!

836
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:00,002
Better than nice.
We should be able to jam it

837
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,271
using a walkie
at that frequency,

838
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,206
use the airport's antenna
to boost the signal.

839
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:06,141
<i>The antenna signal's
way more powerful than the gun.</i>

840
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:07,276
<i>It should override it</i>

841
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,611
<i>and make the bullet
unsteerable.</i>

842
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:11,513
Leah, we need to get within
40 metres of that weapon.

843
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:12,514
Spike, can you be
at that airport

844
00:36:12,582 --> 00:36:13,549
before we are?

845
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:15,150
We're gaining ground.

846
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:16,252
Okay, I'm gonna try
and stall 'em.

847
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:18,086
Get there as soon as you can.

848
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:19,754
Elliot, good work.

849
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:21,589
122.8.

850
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:23,858
Okay, Eddie's their safe passage
onto that plane.

851
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:25,760
After that...

852
00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:26,861
He's disposable.

853
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:40,368
What do we
do with the cop?

854
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:41,636
Well, he's gonna
know we flew out.

855
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:42,737
He doesn't have to know where.

856
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:43,805
Well, that's not gonna happen.

857
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:45,006
Okay.

858
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:46,040
We're gonna get
him on this plane

859
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:48,009
and dump him en route.
Let's go.

860
00:36:48,043 --> 00:36:50,078
Don't do it!

861
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:51,412
<i>Don't do it!</i>

862
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:53,346
You're not gonna shoot him.

863
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:54,248
You think I'd ever let that gun

864
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,250
get out on the street?

865
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:58,585
You think I'd ever,
ever let that happen?

866
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,187
By shooting an innocent person?

867
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:04,258
One life for thousands?
That's a no-brainer.

868
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,392
Or we could end this
right here.

869
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:06,827
Look around you.

870
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:17,870
Keep your gun on the cop.

871
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,488
<i>Jay, I suggest
you put your guns down,</i>

872
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:39,957
<i>you and your friend!</i>

873
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,758
You know how
this works, right?

874
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,961
Those shields are redundant!

875
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,062
<i>This bullet will find you.</i>

876
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,997
I pull this trigger
and you're dead!

877
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,999
Not if we get
this right he's not.

878
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,935
So, you see,
you have no choice.

879
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,036
Math's not on your side.

880
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,806
You're gonna let us go
or one of you is gonna die!

881
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,007
That's guaranteed!

882
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,442
Spike...

883
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:00,443
Almost there.

884
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:02,411
Just hookin' up the walkie.

885
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:03,612
We're leaving.

886
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,613
<i>Spike.</i>

887
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:05,849
Keep him talking.

888
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:06,983
<i>Okay, if we
put these guns down,</i>

889
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,552
<i>no one gets hurt!</i>

890
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:11,721
We good, Spike?

891
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,859
We're good, I think.

892
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:18,560
What do you
mean "you think"?

893
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:20,128
No, we're good.

894
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,096
Okay, Sam, go!

895
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:22,898
Copy.

896
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,466
<i>All right, that's it!</i>

897
00:38:24,533 --> 00:38:25,767
Put your weapon down!

898
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:28,602
What don't you understand?
If I shoot, you die!

899
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,138
Put it down!
Put it down now!

900
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:37,912
<i>You see, Jay?</i>

901
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,514
The math is not on your side.

902
00:38:40,582 --> 00:38:41,448
Last chance!

903
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:43,150
Don't do this!

904
00:39:10,243 --> 00:39:12,744
Okay, it's over, it's over.

905
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:15,447
Hands behind your back.

906
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:16,547
Stand up.

907
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,728
I'm so sorry!

908
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:31,896
Lainie.

909
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,496
I thought I knew
what it was like for you.

910
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:35,232
I thought I understood.

911
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:38,402
I almost lost you, Elliot.

912
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,407
<i>You should have
seen this guy.</i>

913
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:44,641
He couldn't leave his house
a week ago.

914
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:46,509
He was able to cut through
all that chaos

915
00:39:46,577 --> 00:39:47,644
and find the one tiny piece

916
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:50,079
of life-saving information
we needed.

917
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:51,513
122.8 megahertz.

918
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,952
Yeah, I cleared my mind.
I didn't have a choice.

919
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:58,054
That's amazing, Elliot.

920
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:00,122
That's a beginning.
You see that, right?

921
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:01,257
Yeah.

922
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:02,658
I was outside myself
for a little bit.

923
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,827
I wasn't stuck in here.
I was...

924
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,064
Part of something
bigger than me.

925
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:10,966
Thank you.

926
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,733
You're welcome, Elliot.

927
00:40:12,768 --> 00:40:14,902
Good luck to you.

928
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:18,873
Okay.

929
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:23,243
Let me see that.

930
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:30,351
You know that's evidence,
right?

931
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:31,885
I do.

932
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:33,587
Keep it safe.

933
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:39,325
I can't imagine living with
what he lives with.

934
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,027
Well, a lot of people
can't imagine living with

935
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:43,729
what you live with.

936
00:40:50,537 --> 00:40:52,737
Buddy, I need help.

937
00:40:54,273 --> 00:40:57,476
There are things
I can't get out of my head.

938
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,245
I think I might know someone.

939
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:02,347
Okay?

940
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,483
Yeah, come on.

941
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,618
With my research,
I've been so busy.

942
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:08,752
I think you're
gonna like her, Eddie.

943
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:10,821
I check in with her myself
sometimes.

944
00:41:10,855 --> 00:41:12,089
It's just a conversation,
you know?

945
00:41:12,124 --> 00:41:13,757
Just talking, no judging.

946
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:15,659
You're good at talking, right?

947
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:16,693
Yeah.
