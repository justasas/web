1
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,163
Stop!

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,596
You're supposed to stop
for people who need help.

3
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,336
Uh-uh, not so fast, Barry Allen.
Forget about them.

4
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,133
You can't change other people.
Just a waste of energy.

5
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,741
- But…
- Barry…

6
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,606
When I was a little girl,
Grandma taught me a prayer:

7
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,975
Accept the things you cannot change.

8
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,378
Have the courage
to change the things you can,

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,383
and have the wisdom
to know the difference.

10
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,446
I don't totally get that.

11
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,319
Heh, you will.

12
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,619
Now, all we need is a phone.

13
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,263
There's a gas station.

14
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,960
- Race you.
- Barry!

15
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,203
Mom.

16
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,693
And we may never know
exactly what happened...

17
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,837
A break-in gone wrong,
a disturbed mind.

18
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:10,236
But we do know that this was a crime
and a tragedy.

19
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:14,469
And as we commit Nora
to the care of our Lord,

20
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:19,413
we know her son, Barry, will need
all our prayers and help to see him

21
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,415
<i>through this terrible loss.</i>

22
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,921
Happy birthday, Mom.
I'm so sorry.

23
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,392
- I should've been there.
- What?

24
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,431
If I just ran a little faster,
I'd have been there.

25
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,728
Barry, you were just a boy.
There was nothing you could've done.

26
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,098
We don't know that.

27
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,002
If I'd been there,
maybe I could’ve stopped it.

28
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,363
I could’ve saved her.

29
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,206
Come on, stop doing this to yourself.

30
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,107
What was that saying your mother had?

31
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,942
About accepting the things
you can't change?

32
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,587
Well, this is something I can change.

33
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,660
A break-in at the Flash Museum.

34
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,661
- See you later?
- You better.

35
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,285
Well, Flash.

36
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:38,896
Once again, it looks like you're the bottom
and I'm the Top.

37
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,104
Mirror Master and Heat Wave.

38
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,107
Going to a lot of trouble
to steal my old junk, aren't you?

39
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,097
Exhibit's closed, Top.

40
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,940
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

41
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
Captains Boomerang and Cold.

42
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,177
The gang's all here.

43
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,845
And I thought you forgot about us
as soon as you sent us off to prison.

44
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,251
So this little reunion is about revenge?

45
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,656
Not really.
Offing you is just a bonus part of the job.

46
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,557
Job? Who hired you?

47
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,165
No offense, heh, none of you clowns
are smart enough to pull this off.

48
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,563
You're quite right, of course, Flash.

49
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,273
I knew using these morons
would put you off your guard.

50
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,273
- Hey.
- They're motivated by greed.

51
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,777
They lack the commitment,
the absolute focus...

52
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,108
- To kill me.
- Erase you.

53
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,411
I'm gonna bring this shrine to your ego
down on your head.

54
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,454
Along with 10 square blocks
of Central City and everyone around.

55
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,058
What? What are you talking about?
We didn't bring any bombs.

56
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,957
Oh, but I did.

57
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,168
- What is this?
- Something I attached to your belts

58
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,769
as I made my entrance.

59
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,438
I wouldn't unbuckle if I were you.
You'll just set them off.

60
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,871
It's me you want, Thawne.

61
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,945
You don't have to kill
thousands of innocents to bring me down.

62
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,673
No. No, I don't.

63
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:17,220
But I choose to, knowing it will
make your last moments pure agony.

64
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,577
Good bye.

65
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,353
You can't escape, Flash.

66
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,897
The adhesive will never completely liquefy,
regardless of speed.

67
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,160
I'm counting on that. Unh.

68
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,470
Now you got no choice, Thawne.

69
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,303
Disarm the bombs
or you blow up with us.

70
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Very well.

71
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,471
If it means shattering
your golden throne in history,

72
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,982
linking your name forever
to this city's darkest hour,

73
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,678
then my life is a small price to pay.

74
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,180
I agree.

75
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,491
Your lives aren't worth much.

76
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,198
But Flash's life is.

77
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,042
- You called them.
- You've got your posse, I've got mine.

78
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,614
Clearly, you should never do this stuff
without me.

79
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,614
You end up with crap all over yourself.

80
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,455
Focus, GL. Bombs. Batman?

81
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,022
It's future tech.

82
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,059
Difficult to disarm without
setting them off, even for me.

83
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,820
I could try to vaporize the bombs.

84
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,931
Yes, but you'd be vaporizing
the Rogues as well.

85
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,000
Diana's right. What's plan B?

86
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,240
How do we shut off these charges?

87
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,403
You can't. We'll all be dead, shortly.

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,673
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

89
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,076
We're out of options.

90
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,514
Each of you take one of the Rogues
as far from Central City as you can.

91
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,746
We'll attempt to disarm the devices
once sufficiently isolated.

92
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,322
I'm not going to just leave you here.

93
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,359
Lantern, we're running out of time.

94
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,861
Hal, go.

95
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,251
- I'd suck it in if I were you.
- Uh?

96
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,335
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- I am.

97
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,802
I've got a million microbes
eating the bomb's wiring.

98
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,747
Waiting is the worst part.

99
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,503
You may have minimized
the destruction,

100
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,733
but the final bomb will still turn
this monument to your ego

101
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,467
into your own tomb.

102
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,781
What are you doing?
You can't escape.

103
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,885
You can't reach the bomb to disarm it.
You're going to die.

104
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,045
You may have my powers, Thawne,

105
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,388
but you have almost zero imagination
about using them.

106
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,026
Lacks like 25th-century technology
is pretty delicate.

107
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,143
I've notified S.T.A.R. Labs to ready a
cozy little cell for you, Professor.

108
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,582
I understand the food's not great there,
Zoom.

109
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,882
Enjoy your petty little victories, Flash.

110
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:24,791
But no matter how fast you run,
you can't save everyone.

111
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,556
Not the ones that matter to you.

112
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:33,533
Best to keep your mouth shut
if you don't want bugs in your teeth.

113
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,633
Thawne's a classic sociopath.

114
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,802
They have a knack for knowing
just what will get under your skin.

115
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,504
Yeah. They do.

116
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,117
You okay?

117
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,514
Don't worry about me, Bats. I'm fine.

118
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,952
Nothing I can't run off.

119
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:10,013
Subripped by Reef
addic7ed.com

120
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,214
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

121
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,509
I don't mean to interrupt your beauty
sleep, Lord knows you need it,

122
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,623
but the Elongated Kid murderer
isn't gonna catch himself.

123
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,317
- Elongated Man was murdered?
- Elongated <i>Kid.</i>

124
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,523
What?

125
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:37,327
Director Singh wants us pulling
all-nighters until we close this case.

126
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,690
Hey, what's going on?

127
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,103
<i>We interrupt our programming
to bring breaking news.</i>

128
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,898
We're live outside the Cold Museum.

129
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,042
<i>Citizen Cold
is battling Captain Boomerang.</i>

130
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,667
<i>Reportedly, the confrontation began
inside the museum moments ago.</i>

131
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,370
Cold is on the loose already?

132
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,982
Do we really have to learn
this stuff on TV?

133
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,176
Doesn't anyone call the cops anymore?

134
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,252
Looks like a power struggle
in the Rogues.

135
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,389
- Who are the Rogues?
- The Rogues.

136
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,751
Flash's worst enemies…?

137
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,827
Bent on Flash's destruction,
so they can take over Central City?

138
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,056
Okay, we'll continue
this hilarious leg-pulling later.

139
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,996
After the Flash has taken care
of Citizen Cold.

140
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,076
Barry, are you all right?

141
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,702
<i>Mom?</i>

142
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,218
Mom.

143
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,483
Oh, that was a nasty spill,
even for you.

144
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,060
Let me see your head.

145
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,495
I'm fine. Mom.

146
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,532
It's you. You're here.

147
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,535
Heh, well, of course I'm here.

148
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,334
You promised me
you'd take me to dinner on my birthday.

149
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,411
It's my birthday.
The end of the world can't stop that.

150
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,616
You forgot. Heh, it's okay, Barry.

151
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,619
It's easy for a busy young man
to forget his old mom.

152
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,621
I could never forget you.

153
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,063
Oh, heh. Oh, my.

154
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,296
Barry, what's gotten into you?
Are you all right?

155
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,533
People have been acting so strangely with
this terrible war hanging over their heads.

156
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,577
War? What? No, Mom, I'm fine.

157
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,341
But everything else has changed,
and I have to find out why.

158
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,643
It probably has something
to do with me being...

159
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,117
- Gay?
- What? No.

160
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,654
It's okay. I lave you no matter what.

161
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:44,488
Mom, it's not that. It's something else.

162
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,461
Brace yourself for a shock.

163
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,230
I'm the Flash.

164
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,498
What's "the Flash?"

165
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,734
You know, the Flash.
Fastest man alive?

166
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,607
Fights crime?
Very famous superhero?

167
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:07,410
A superhero?
Heh, you mean like Batman?

168
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,927
Where's the Joker? Unh.

169
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,823
Where, Yo-Yo?

170
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,036
Tell me where the Joker's funhouse
is this time.

171
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,763
While you can still talk.

172
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,767
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. Ow.

173
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,770
Let me help you get it off.

174
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,985
Judge Dent was kidnapped last night.
Where did the Joker take him?

175
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,620
Even if I did know,
it wouldn't do you any good, Bats.

176
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,785
- He's probably already dead.
- Then so are you.

177
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,440
Cyborg? I surrender.

178
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,306
To you.

179
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,810
Smart.

180
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,548
- Batman.
- You should have let her hit the pavement.

181
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,314
- You shouldn't have thrown her.
- She slipped.

182
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,185
- Aren't you wondering how I found you?
- Thermal vision.

183
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,547
Cybernetic hearing.

184
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,594
And total access to every camera
on the grid.

185
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,062
Must be a nice perk for being
in the president's back pocket.

186
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,030
I've told you it's not like that.

187
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,670
As national security adviser,
I can help more people.

188
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,067
Like that murdering psychopath?

189
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,936
Maybe you should go help people
in some other town.

190
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,873
We're trying to help all the people,

191
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,411
while there's still a world left.
We need you.

192
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,378
We...?

193
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,115
Hologram party. Ingenious.

194
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,153
Saves a fortune on snacks.

195
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:06,024
Enchantress, Pied Piper, Citizen Cold,
Shade, Sandman, The Shazam Kids.

196
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:10,326
It's Batman. Seriously, Batman.

197
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,164
- He's older than I thought.
- But I'm not hard of hearing.

198
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,370
You know why we're here, Batman.
War.

199
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,772
Over 100 million people died

200
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,143
when Atlantis sank
Western Europe into the ocean.

201
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,443
Another 32 million slaughtered,

202
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,882
when the Amazons
invaded the United Kingdom

203
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,885
and renamed it New Themyscira.

204
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,251
We have to take down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman

205
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,553
before their war destroys
what's left of the world.

206
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,330
- We can do it.
- That's exactly what Captain Atom said,

207
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,798
before he flew over there and vanished.

208
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,427
He went in without a plan or backup.
That's where you come in.

209
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:52,132
If we want to win this thing, we need
the best tactician on the planet.

210
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,243
You.

211
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,881
You can't just turn your back on this.

212
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,108
Not when we've got a chance to stop
this war and save the world.

213
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,346
War's over, soldier.
You just don't know it yet.

214
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,388
Everybody lost.

215
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:24,232
- Can I help you, sir?
- Sir? Doris, it's me.

216
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,641
No, I don't need help.
Everything's fine now.

217
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,648
<i>Mommy.</i>

218
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,081
- How is my little angel?
- Awesome.

219
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,421
Daddy took me out to lunch
and we had chicken wings,

220
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:50,431
and I told him about the invasion drill
we had at school today.

221
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:24,463
Bruce? Alfred?

222
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,553
What happened to you, Bruce?

223
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,247
You were the James Bond
of superheroes.

224
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,584
What turned you into the Unabomber?

225
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,764
Who are you?

226
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:02,099
I said who the hell are you?

227
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,871
Bruce, wait. You have to remember.
It's me. It's Barry.

228
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,104
Barry Allen. Bruce?

229
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,714
- Bruce?
- Bruce.

230
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,680
Bruce is dead. I watched him die.

231
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,444
My God.

232
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,487
He's the one who died
that night in the alley.

233
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:24,116
Bruce died and you lived.
You're his father.

234
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,658
You're Thomas Wayne.

235
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,361
Pilgrim to Mayflower, do you copy?

236
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,236
Where the hell are you?
I'm at the rendezvous point.

237
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,640
There's no sign of the package
or any other members of the resistance.

238
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,711
And I'm up to my neck in Amazons.

239
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,341
You're an American.

240
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,137
But you're going to tell me
a little more about yourself.

241
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,838
- Who are you?
- No. Ugh.

242
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,711
He's resisting the Lasso of Truth.

243
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,182
How is that possible, Queen Diana?

244
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,117
It's not.

245
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,189
Who are you, and what are you doing
in New Themyscira?

246
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,860
My name is Colonel Steve Trevor
of the United States Special Forces.

247
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,596
- I'm here to retrieve Lois Lane.
- Who is Lois Lane?

248
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,104
Lois Lane is a Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist

249
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,038
who's been embedded
in New Themyscira for three months,

250
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,109
gathering intel
on your Amazons for Cyborg.

251
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,613
She's, unh... She's also one of the most
beautiful woman I've ever met.

252
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,971
Until now, you mean.

253
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,855
Our information was correct.

254
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,013
Cyborg is amassing the outside
world's super-humans,

255
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,123
in an attempt
to interfere with our war.

256
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,125
He will fail.
Now, find me this Lois Lane.

257
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:10,028
Yes, my Queen.
May I deal with the prisoner for you?

258
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,388
No.

259
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,996
The Queen of the Amazons
is a servant to her people.

260
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,236
Nothing is beneath her.

261
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,927
I told you, everything changed.

262
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,120
You have nine more fingers.

263
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,130
I suggest you tell me
how you found out about me.

264
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,936
In my world,
I'm a hero named the Flash.

265
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,165
Bruce took me here, showed me...

266
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,868
I used to be a doctor.

267
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,774
Mention my dead son again and I will
break out my surgical instruments.

268
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:12,786
My ring. Let me show you
that I'm telling the truth.

269
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,295
My uniform is in that ring.

270
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,292
I'll humor you.

271
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,037
See? I told…

272
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,094
Not what you were expecting?

273
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,716
- No. Thawne.
- Who?

274
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,822
The man this uniform belongs to.

275
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,425
My opposite, the Reverse-Flash.
Eobard Thawne.

276
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:47,086
- What kind of name is <i>Eobard?</i>
- The 25th-century kind.

277
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,722
He replicated the accident that allowed me
to tap into the Speed Force,

278
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,994
became a criminal,
Professor Zoom.

279
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,358
"Speed Force?"

280
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:59,135
The Speed Force allows both of us to bend
the laws of physics using super speed.

281
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,334
He can travel through time.

282
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,508
You're suggesting that he changed
something in the past...

283
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,344
That changed everything. It's crazy.

284
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,249
My mom's alive. You're Batman.

285
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,255
And Diana and Arthur
are about to start World War Ill.

286
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,751
But why give me this?

287
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,260
He hates you.

288
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,026
So much he'll destroy everything
to kill you.

289
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,831
But his psychosis requires
that you know he's responsible.

290
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,634
Could anyone, even Thawne,
be that deranged?

291
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:39,375
You'd be amazed the monsters
this world can create.

292
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,717
We have to stop this, Dr. Wayne.

293
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,750
Catch Thawne,
find out what he changed,

294
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,480
and change it back before Aquaman
and Wonder Woman

295
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,522
kill everyone on the planet.

296
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,651
Not saying I believe you,
but in your reality...

297
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,798
- Is my son...?
- Bruce is alive.

298
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,900
He's Batman.

299
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,269
If I were to help you,
what exactly would we need?

300
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:07,137
Just what's over there
and unbelievably bad weather.

301
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,578
Welcome to Gotham.

302
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,342
I thought you were supposed to be smart.

303
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,794
I am smart, captain. Very smart.

304
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,591
Unfortunately,
having the greatest intellect on Earth

305
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,994
doesn't always help one
do the impossible.

306
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,693
You better be able to pinpoint
that son of a bitch.

307
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,600
Aquaman's doomsday device
should be easy for me to find,

308
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,832
simply by locating the power source.

309
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,375
A weapon capable
of wiping out continents

310
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,979
would require an astonishing
amount of energy.

311
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,978
Based on my analysis
of the shockwave,

312
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,777
our course should take us
right over the origin point.

313
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,352
And there's nothing. Not a blip.

314
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,012
I'm taking a big risk
coming this close to his waters.

315
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,319
- How close are we?
- See for yourself.

316
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,732
That's a lot of death.

317
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,093
Even for me.

318
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,471
I suggest if you want to prevent further
tragedies of this magnitude...

319
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,862
Battle stations!

320
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,266
A bit too late for that, I think.

321
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,014
Surface-dwellers, my lord.
Not Amazons.

322
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,387
Meddlers, Orm. They're in my way.

323
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,689
Well, at least I know I was right.

324
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,332
No survivors.

325
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,143
This is crazy. You ought to be in Arkham.

326
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,805
Maybe so, but I need to recreate
the conditions of the accident

327
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,474
that turned me into the Flash.
Strap me in.

328
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:20,091
You know, they say that lightning
doesn't strike the same place twice.

329
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,231
"They say" a lot of things.

330
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,492
Now why don't we pull the switch
and find out?

331
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,305
Come on.

332
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,295
Come on, I'm here.

333
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,795
I'm right here!

334
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,120
Oh, my God.

335
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,940
<i>I wish you had better news for me, Cyborg.</i>

336
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,573
<i>This cloud of war grows ever darker,
and I fear we've run out of options.</i>

337
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,849
l just need a little more time,
Mr. President.

338
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:58,256
<i>Victor, there is no more time.
Lex Luthor is dead.</i>

339
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,759
<i>His mission failed.</i>

340
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,331
<i>But at least we know the estimated
location of Aquaman's WMD.</i>

341
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,367
Sir, let my team take
out the Atlantean device.

342
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:11,030
<i>Cyborg, you did your best recruiting
meta-humans to help us end this conﬂict,</i>

343
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:15,439
<i>but our top analysts say without
the Batman, you have no team.</i>

344
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,876
<i>It's time to send in
the real heroes, son.</i>

345
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,344
The military?

346
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,883
The Atlantean tech will see them coming
from half a world away.

347
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,714
<i>Let our boys worry about that.</i>

348
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,755
<i>Thank you for everything
you've done for this country, Victor.</i>

349
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:31,621
<i>But as of now, you're relieved of duty.</i>

350
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,177
<i>War, war, war!</i>

351
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,955
No…

352
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,401
No!

353
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,246
Lie down.
You have third-degree burns.

354
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,611
You're lucky to be alive.

355
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:56,358
Somehow I remember things
from this timeline.

356
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,400
How Aquaman destroyed
most of Europe.

357
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,696
Maybe that lightning jagged
your memory.

358
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,305
But I can remember my world as well.

359
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:08,000
A world where Aquaman would die
before harming innocent people.

360
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:13,912
My memories are changing, realigning
with this new history Thawne's created.

361
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,950
Soon I'll forget my timeline
and everyone in it.

362
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,918
My wife, your son.

363
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,718
- We're getting that world back.
- Huh. How?

364
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,890
We try again.

365
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,128
Try again.

366
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,794
But, sire, the device is too dangerous.

367
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,430
Our attack on New Themyscira
destroyed an entire continent,

368
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,373
but still left the Amazon's
new homeland untouched.

369
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:48,609
More unholy magic from those witches.
Next time we will level their island.

370
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,384
Please, my Emperor.

371
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,717
We tried to use only a fraction
of the power,

372
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,723
and now it is even less stable.

373
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,261
I fear we could sweep clean the ocean floor
as well as the surface world.

374
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,619
I see.

375
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,961
Then we will take the witches' island
by force.

376
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,500
Inch by bloody inch, if necessary.

377
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,298
They will pay
for what they did to Queen Mera.

378
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,371
I told you never to speak her name.

379
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,241
Yes, my liege.

380
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,746
Prepare the armadas
for surface invasion.

381
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,579
The Amazons' judgment is at hand.

382
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:39,797
Because of you, I'll be responsible
for the deaths of millions.

383
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,331
The odds against recreating exact
variables in the original accident are...

384
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,947
Then just try to douse the flames
a little faster this time, okay?

385
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:54,938
Told you I was fast.

386
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,746
This is Lois Lane of <i> The Daily Planet</i>.

387
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,980
My battery is about to die
and l will likely be joining it soon.

388
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:26,133
Earlier today the Amazons captured
some of Aquaman's advance scouts.

389
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,905
Wonder Woman's lasso made them
spill their guts, literally.

390
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,823
Aquaman is leading his army through
the English Channel tomorrow.

391
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,765
The Amazons are worried
that if he gets his secret weapon

392
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,269
past their shield,
they'll be vulnerable.

393
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,110
They remain defiant in the face of...

394
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,050
If there is an afterlife...

395
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,693
A cushy anchor job
would not be out of line.

396
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,370
Amazons, be ready for...

397
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,985
Who are you? What are you?

398
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,225
Don't worry, hot legs.
We're on your side.

399
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,893
Yes, fear not, good lady.

400
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,898
Though our appearance
is somewhat frightful, we're...

401
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,468
The Resistance, I know.

402
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,163
Grifter, Godiva, Mrs. Hyde,
Canterbury Cricket.

403
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,313
And some kind of demon from hell?

404
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:18,182
To my share of chaos I make my claim
and Etrigan is my name.

405
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:21,118
Oh, great, he rhymes.
That's not going to get old fast.

406
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,816
Heh, Lois Lane's famous mouth.

407
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,553
I can't believe you didn't get
an arrow shot through it.

408
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:31,564
I would have, if it weren't for whichever
one of you can run at super-speed.

409
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,395
So who do I thank?

410
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:37,505
I don't know what you think just happened,
but there ain't no speedster on this team.

411
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,141
Now, let's get out of here
while we still can.

412
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,947
Never seen anything like it.

413
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,120
Your burns are healing.
You should be dead.

414
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,256
Your bedside manner sucks.

415
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,858
If I didn't have the Speed Force
helping me heal, I'd find another doctor.

416
00:41:58,716 --> 00:41:59,990
I run a casino.

417
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,221
Haven't been a doctor in 20 years.

418
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:06,425
Here. You need a suit,
and I'm not about to loan you one of mine.

419
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,434
What? It's friction-proof, isn't it?

420
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,975
I had to at least make some
last-minute alterations.

421
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,641
Very snazzy.
I suggest you take it for a test run,

422
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,083
and make sure you can break
that time barrier.

423
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,745
Once we know that...

424
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:36,494
So I'm finally on the other end
of that trick.

425
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,284
Come on, Barry. Faster.

426
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,887
Faster.

427
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,939
If you would just slip these
over your shoes, Mr. Jordan.

428
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,779
Sure. Cleaning bill here must be murder.

429
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,477
What's your name?

430
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,318
I'm afraid we don't have time
for introductions, Captain Jordan.

431
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,428
- Pity.
- I was warned about you.

432
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,622
But the president wanted the best pilot,
so you're stuck with me.

433
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,333
Why don't you show me
what you've got hidden away here,

434
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,460
and I'll show you what
I can do with it?

435
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,799
Holy crap…

436
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,840
I was hoping this would shut you up.

437
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,741
Crashed in the California Desert
eight years ago.

438
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,814
Our scientists have been
piecing it back together since then.

439
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:06,717
Its handling capabilities are,
well, beyond anything that we have.

440
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,086
May be a little tricky to get the hang of.

441
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,593
Ooh, and who's this handsome devil?

442
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,254
- Pilot.
- Died on impact?

443
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,297
Kicked off just as my men found him.

444
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,526
Report said he muttered
something in English:

445
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,466
"Beware my power."

446
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:26,733
Then a glowing ring floated off his finger
and shot into space.

447
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,706
His ring flew away?

448
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,312
You're about to fly
a dead alien's spaceship,

449
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,971
and that's the part
you have trouble believing?

450
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,338
Tauché.

451
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:39,343
You understand, Jordan,
this mission is no cake walk. In fact...

452
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,717
In fact, in all likelihood,
it's a one-way trip.

453
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,725
And if I'm afraid, if I want to back out,
no hard feelings, something like that?

454
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,521
Something like that.

455
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,598
General Lane, all my life,
I felt like something

456
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,030
really special was waiting for me.

457
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,033
Something nobody else
on earth could do.

458
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,698
I think l just found it.
So the last thing I am is afraid.

459
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,312
This thing is unbelievably slow,
just like me.

460
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,346
You move pretty fast to my eyes.

461
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,917
Not fast enough to break the time barrier,
which I need to do.

462
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:15,217
The only thing I can figure is that another
speedster is co-opting the Speed Force,

463
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,155
keeping me from accessing
enough energy to time-travel.

464
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:23,162
But there is no other speedster.
Not in the real world. My world.

465
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,924
So it has to be Zoom.

466
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,194
He's the only one
who could’ve done this.

467
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:30,133
He's deliberately preventing me
from changing things back.

468
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:31,796
Then nothing can be done.

469
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:35,671
Even if we knew the trigger point, there's
no one to go back in time and fix it.

470
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,779
Superman could.

471
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:42,315
I already told you, there's no meta-human
that fits that description in this reality.

472
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:43,952
I'm not so sure.

473
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:48,614
In my new memories of this timeline,
I saw something.

474
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:52,249
- A meteor. It hit a city.
- Metropolis.

475
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,616
Thirty years ago.

476
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,097
The same day Superman's rocket
crashed in my reality.

477
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,432
So this never happened in your world?

478
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,008
- It must be a paradise.
- It's not.

479
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,473
But at least there was hope.

480
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,113
What makes you think
your space baby survived?

481
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,469
He's a tough cookie.

482
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,143
- Where's your contact?
- Don't worry. He's always on time.

483
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,449
I have to admit, I didn't expect your call.

484
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,814
Cyborg?

485
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,031
- Vic? You look different.
- Have we met?

486
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,896
No, he's new. Super-speed.
Goes by the Flash.

487
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,333
You still need a strategist
for your little army?

488
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,029
Someone to put together a team

489
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,334
to shut down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman?

490
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,376
- I... Yes.
- I'll do it.

491
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:47,414
But my way, and I pick the team.
Starting with the Flash.

492
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,745
Then we want to find the alien
who crash-landed here in Metropolis.

493
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,819
Alien? What are you talking about?

494
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,176
The meteor.

495
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,019
It's not what your pals
at the Pentagon said it was.

496
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:02,357
Classified information.
We need it and you can get it.

497
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,373
Why aren't you telling him
about me and the timeline?

498
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:15,442
- I'm not lying.
- You're misleading him.

499
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,943
He has a right to know
what our real plan is.

500
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,809
Don't preach to me.
I got enough misplaced morality

501
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,884
to handle with the big metal
Boy Scout on our hands.

502
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,385
He wants to stop the war.
So do we.

503
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:27,851
That's all he needs to know.

504
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,791
There's something there,
but it's above even my clearance.

505
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:36,254
I don't hack into government systems,
Batman.

506
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,728
You do now.

507
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,232
If you want me
on your little suicide squad.

508
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,732
I'm cycling the motion sensors
and security cameras,

509
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,890
but the loop won't go unnoticed
for long.

510
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,763
Early morning skeleton crew.

511
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,030
Well, do your thing.

512
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:37,652
I'm trusting
that this is <i>absolutely</i> necessary.

513
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,260
That's why we're here.

514
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,397
Listen, I don't know
what changed your mind or why,

515
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:47,365
but with you on board,
we can save the world from this war.

516
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,730
Thank you.

517
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,803
Focus on the mission at hand, Stone.

518
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,053
Sir, are you okay?

519
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,468
Is that Clark?

520
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,866
This is the most powerful being
on the planet?

521
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,235
Help me.

522
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,243
Whoa, easy there, friend.
Everything's going to be fine now.

523
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:07,610
- Friend?
- That's right.

524
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:11,378
Cyborg here is your friend.
I'm your friend too.

525
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,356
This must be some kind of mistake.

526
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,590
- A rogue division of the government…
- Keep telling yourself that.

527
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,599
We should have left him where he was.
He'd be safer.

528
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,704
He needs the sun.

529
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,239
Don't know if you can understand me,
but what happened to you was wrong.

530
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,741
- Most humans aren't like them.
- They're worse.

531
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,674
No. People are good.

532
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,781
In fact, some of them risk their lives
for the greater good.

533
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,816
- They're called heroes.
- Heroes?

534
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:47,046
Don't worry, friend.
Everything is going to be okay.

535
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,780
I thought heroes never lied.

536
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,527
Cyborg, stand down!
You have exceeded your authority.

537
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:03,000
Return the stolen government property
or face immediate fire.

538
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,630
You don't understand.
They were using this man as a lab rat.

539
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,640
I don't think they care, Vic.

540
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,779
So beautiful.

541
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,442
I have orders from the president
of the United States.

542
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,578
- Maybe I can end this peacefully.
- Yeah, maybe.

543
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,620
No!

544
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,494
Friends.

545
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,985
Superman, close your eyes!

546
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,727
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a seizure.

547
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,124
Memories collapsing in on each other.
We gotta get him out of here.

548
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:11,426
Fight it, Allen. Don't forget my son.

549
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,760
Hell, yeah!

550
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,772
<i>Highball, this is Papa Bear.</i>

551
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,249
<i>- Cut the chatter.</i>
- Oh, did I say that out loud?

552
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,565
I didn't know.

553
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,555
<i>You're only 1000 miles from drop zone.</i>

554
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,776
<i>- Commence radio silence.</i>
- Happily.

555
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,438
<i>One last thing, Jordan.
On behalf of all humanity…</i>

556
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,163
Oh, shut your hole already.
You're ruining this for me.

557
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,724
There you are, baby.
Hold still for Highball.

558
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,759
"Beware my power", asshole.

559
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,455
Continue invasion preparations.

560
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,159
- Who the hell is this?
- He's with us.

561
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,029
Now shut up. What's the story?

562
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,297
Some kind of failed kamikaze attack
on Aquaman's weapon.

563
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:28,375
- The pilot was Hal Jordan.
- Hal's dead?

564
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:29,737
That's not all.

565
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,709
The president sent a coalition fleet
to New Themyscira.

566
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,576
The Amazons decimated it.

567
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,809
Troops are being ordered
to Washington D.C.,

568
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,385
to protect the President
and members of Congress.

569
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,921
Yeah, as our fearless leaders
make a mad dash for the bunkers.

570
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,279
What does it mean?

571
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:49,558
It means the final battle between Atlantis
and the Amazons has begun.

572
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,824
But we haven't even started yet.

573
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,524
There's nothing we can do now.

574
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,296
Enjoy the things you love
with the time we have left.

575
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,803
There's bound to be looting
in Gotham by now.

576
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,972
I don't want to miss that.

577
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,634
You're just gonna give up
and wait for the inevitable?

578
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,643
Is that what your heroes do here?

579
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,146
Look, you guys may not know me.

580
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,912
But all of us have powers,
skills and abilities.

581
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,715
Where I come from,
heroes use those powers

582
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,849
to fight to make the world a better
place, whether it's their world or not.

583
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,428
But Superman...
You said he was our last, best hope.

584
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,725
We're alive, Vic.
And where there's life, there's hope.

585
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,089
We'll go to London,

586
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,037
fight both sides
and save the world in the process.

587
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:34,205
Okay. Then we go. Now.

588
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:37,208
I'll signal the others.
Maybe they can meet us there.

589
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,513
Bruce would have come.

590
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,906
What the hell. Let's do this.

591
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,452
Is the Batplane big enough
for all of us?

592
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,849
The what?

593
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,722
Bruce's Batplane was a little more stoic.

594
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:59,093
Your Batman
didn't have to ferry high rollers

595
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,462
with deep pockets
in and out of his casino.

596
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,400
So he wouldn't need
a fully stocked bar aboard.

597
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:07,269
Everything is top shelf.
Help yourself.

598
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,535
I don't drink.

599
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,077
Shocking.

600
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,738
I'm glad I could persuade you
to come along.

601
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,104
You didn't.

602
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,586
Ever since I told Cyborg I'd help, I've been
scanning for intel coming out of Europe.

603
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,746
During your little Braveheart speech,

604
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:26,382
l heard an intercepted message
you may find interesting.

605
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,789
What?

606
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:31,042
Lois Lane was an embedded
reporter turned resistance fighter.

607
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,123
She saw something in New Themyscira.

608
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,929
A super being who could move
in the blink of an eye.

609
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,292
Thawne.

610
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,604
If it was him, why let Lane live,
much less help her?

611
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:44,075
- And if he's as fast as you...
- Why let himself be seen?

612
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,236
Incoming!

613
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:01,422
Sire, the aircraft has
been intercepted and nullified.

614
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,689
Would that all our shots be so lucky.

615
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:05,696
We have more than luck, Orm.

616
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,924
Death to the under-dwellers! Unh.

617
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,423
Kill them. Kill them all.

618
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:28,404
Behold man's final mad disgrace.

619
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:32,178
He chops his nose to spite his face.

620
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,525
You've got to put an end to this.

621
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,530
You're going to destroy the only world
we've got.

622
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,431
You won't have it much longer,
surface-dweller.

623
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,481
Plan B. Take down
as many on both sides as you can.

624
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,142
Maybe we can kill enough of them
to call off this war.

625
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,979
Fight your way to the leaders.

626
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:39,848
Once we have Aquaman
and Wonder Woman, this war is over.

627
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,818
You murdered my wife, Diana.

628
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:17,356
She tried to assassinate me, Arthur.
I was protecting myself.

629
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:19,687
Yet you wear her helmet like a trophy.

630
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,227
No. A warning.

631
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,572
I can't believe I ever loved you.

632
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,005
You never did.

633
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:42,871
Now!

634
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,760
Shazam!

635
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:00,868
Captain Thunder.

636
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:06,269
I'm happy to see that a real man is here
to watch the end of man's world.

637
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:12,406
Fall, damn it, fall!

638
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,313
Sweet.

639
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,858
I like your style, Batman.

640
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:44,067
A pity we never teamed up
when the world still existed.

641
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,764
Batman and Grifter, the boy idiot.

642
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,773
Take your team up the right flank and...

643
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,861
Don't worry, Batman.
I'll stop the blood flow.

644
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,621
You'll be as good as new.

645
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,231
Don't be stupid, Allen.

646
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:16,565
I may not be a very good doctor, but
even I know a dead man when I see one.

647
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:25,144
- They're gonna die.
- We're dead already.

648
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,714
Find the speedster.

649
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,350
Flush him out.

650
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:32,077
Change all this.

651
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:33,442
No.

652
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,422
I won't stand by while people are...

653
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:44,653
Hello, Barry.

654
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:46,392
Thawne.

655
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:51,327
- I love what you've done with the place.
- This is all your fault.

656
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,956
This has worked out so well.

657
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:16,324
That's why I let Lois Lane see me,
you know.

658
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:17,965
I knew it would bring you.

659
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:25,232
Not that you wouldn't have ended up here
anyway, you hero, you.

660
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,439
What did you do to the world?

661
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,274
Oh, Barry.

662
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,678
That's the beauty of all this.

663
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,841
I didn't do any of it.

664
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,816
You did.

665
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,188
Think, Barry.

666
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:57,196
Isn't there some little thing, some little
good deed you might have done?

667
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:02,228
- I saved someone.
- Yes.

668
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:07,530
I saved her. I saved Mom.

669
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:12,811
- That's right.
- No. No.

670
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,744
It wouldn't have changed all this.

671
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,544
It wouldn't have changed
what happened before her murder.

672
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,687
Bruce's parents, Clark's landing.

673
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:22,881
Oh, but it did.

674
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,156
Break the sound barrier
and there's a sonic beam.

675
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:29,991
You broke the time barrier, Flash.
Time beam.

676
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:33,623
Ripples of distortion radiated out
through that point of impact,

677
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,532
shifting everything just a tiny bit.

678
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:37,893
But enough.

679
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:41,201
Enough for events to happen
slightly differently.

680
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,770
I just wanted to save her.

681
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:50,179
Her hero. How noble. Oh, wait.

682
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,549
You didn't stop JFK
from getting assassinated,

683
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,213
or made sure Hitler stayed
in Art School.

684
01:06:56,379 --> 01:07:00,418
You saved your mommy.
You missed her.

685
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:05,692
And in a supreme act of selfishness,
shattered history like a rank amateur,

686
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,701
turned the world into a living hell
moments away from destruction.

687
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,463
And I'm the villain?

688
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,224
No!

689
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,961
This form is not your own.

690
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,828
How is the enchantment broken?

691
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,994
With a word.

692
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,901
Speak the word.

693
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:56,898
Shazam!

694
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,396
The era of the land-dweller
is at an end, hero.

695
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:29,032
Your metal skull
will decorate my great hall.

696
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:44,057
Hero.

697
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:47,194
Friend.

698
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:22,951
Submit.

699
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:26,391
You are beaten.

700
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,756
Surrender?

701
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,171
Then what?

702
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:34,672
You'll let the men of Atlantis
live as your slaves?

703
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,031
The men? No.

704
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,908
You are a pestilence the mother Gaia
has suffered for too long.

705
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:45,678
- But perhaps Atlantis' daughters...
- There will be no glorious victor, Diana.

706
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:47,042
No prize.

707
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:52,656
What I do now,
I do for the good of all.

708
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,085
As do I.

709
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:22,490
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out of here, before he...

710
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,329
It's too late.

711
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,233
Good job, Barry.

712
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:46,107
The world is about to end, thanks to you.

713
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:48,715
I hope your mother has a good view of it.

714
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,977
You can't let this happen, Thawne.
You'll die too.

715
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:56,055
- As you say in this era, totally worth it.
- Unh.

716
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:04,456
As long as I can siphon off the Speed
Force, you can't escape this timeline.

717
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,302
I'm afraid there just isn't enough
Speed Force to go around.

718
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,901
There is now.

719
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:19,768
You killed him.

720
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,406
Not necessarily.

721
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,615
Not if you go back in time and fix this.

722
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:41,128
The only way to save the world
is to keep this world from ever happening.

723
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,361
Take this.

724
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,503
Run.

725
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,700
Barry!

726
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:57,606
Stop, you'll kill everyone!

727
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:16,625
Barry! Stop! You have to stop!

728
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,561
What the hell?

729
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:20,588
Get away.

730
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,520
Mom, I'm so sorry.

731
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,400
- Barry.
- Ah!

732
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,675
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

733
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,874
Gotta run, James.

734
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:15,085
You don't finish the files by Friday,
you'll be stuck here all weekend.

735
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:18,489
Well, it's not the end of the world.

736
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:26,956
I think I finally got it, Mom.

737
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,603
The things you were trying to teach me.

738
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:33,070
- Barry?
- Iris?

739
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:46,352
Well, heh, that's my kind of hello.

740
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:50,787
- Is everything all right?
- It is now, honey.

741
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:54,220
It is now.

742
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:58,323
Just to review,
you brake the <i>chronal</i> barrier,

743
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:01,161
went back in time,
prevented your mother's murder

744
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:03,565
and completely changed
the time stream.

745
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,400
Nearly destroying
the entire world along the way.

746
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,870
Yes.

747
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,135
There's still something
I don't understand.

748
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:11,801
I remember all of it.

749
01:16:11,968 --> 01:16:16,439
Not just what happened after
I wake up there, but my whole other life.

750
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:19,552
I remember every birthday cake
my mother ever baked me.

751
01:16:19,709 --> 01:16:22,280
My room, everything.

752
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:25,517
Perhaps some kind of temporal
after-effect?

753
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:29,728
Or perhaps it was a gift.

754
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:36,660
Yes. A gift.

755
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,666
This is my father's handwriting.

756
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:03,493
You're one hell of a messenger.

757
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,397
Thank you.

758
