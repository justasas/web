1
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:19,112
Julianna Callaghan,

2
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:22,381
I vow to be true always,

3
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,451
to give you all of myself -
no secrets...

4
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:29,521
Until death parts us,
and even after...

5
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:32,591
'Cause I've been yours

6
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,226
since the first day I saw you

7
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:35,928
and made a fool of myself.

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,564
<i>'Cause I knew right away,</i>

9
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:42,600
I knew that it was you
or no one...

10
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:46,203
Even though
you didn't know it yet,

11
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:48,139
and I had to be patient.

12
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:49,507
I was right.
Just saying.

13
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:00,017
Samuel Braddock,

14
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:04,087
I vow to always be yours.

15
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:18,801
I tried to...
think of words,

16
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,004
but there's so many...

17
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:24,140
there's so many words.

18
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:29,078
So, I vow, to you, this...

19
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,049
Yeah!

20
00:01:40,323 --> 00:01:43,458
So um... since you guys
are all here,

21
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:44,826
<i>we would have told you earlier,</i>

22
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:47,295
<i>but we didn't want</i>
<i>to jinx anything.</i>

23
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:48,462
We're three months along;

24
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,599
we're having a baby.

25
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:59,172
- Congratulations. Good for you.
- Thank you.

26
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,909
- Right on!
- Come here, you!

27
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:38,776
911, what is your emergency?

28
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:40,845
I'm wearing a peach dress,

29
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,313
so if you wear a peach rose,

30
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:44,653
it means... gratitude.

31
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,284
Oh, right, 'cause
he should be grateful

32
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:47,852
that you asked him to prom.

33
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,254
<i>What colour's your boutonnier?</i>

34
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,754
Uh, whatever colour
means "no curfew

35
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,755
'cause it's prom."

36
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,257
- Seriously?
- Yeah,

37
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:54,291
my parents have late-night
plans of their own.

38
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:56,192
They're going
to some hotel downtown.

39
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,027
Plus they trust me.
It's weird.

40
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,130
Plus you're not gonna
tell them.

41
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,399
Scary.
Just like your dad.

42
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,468
You sure you wanna date
a walking polygraph?

43
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:06,669
Yeah, I'm sure.

44
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:07,803
All right. You
guys need a ride?

45
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,171
Nah.
We're gonna be okay, man.

46
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:09,972
All right. See you later.

47
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,474
Later.

48
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,977
So you've met
my infamous brothers.

49
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:16,579
Good to meet you.

50
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:17,513
You talked the boss
outta the brown suit.

51
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:18,514
Well, Wordy, somebody had to.

52
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:19,715
Hey, I heard that.

53
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,684
I mean, really,

54
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,685
it's a fabulous dress.
I like it.

55
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:24,819
- Really?
- Yes, Donna.

56
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:26,154
Such a gentleman,

57
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:28,222
and always a kind word;
That's why I love you.

58
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,391
Debrief went long;

59
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,525
some people have to work hard.

60
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:31,726
How's team three?

61
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,060
I'm kicking 'em into shape.

62
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,796
I told you she couldn't
stay away from the job.

63
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:35,830
How are you, Wordy?

64
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:37,365
I'm good.
Girls are good.

65
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,499
I miss the days though.

66
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,900
Days miss you right back.

67
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,034
You going to the reception
tonight?

68
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:42,303
Absolutely.

69
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,171
<i>You know what? Team one's got
a shift to get through first</i>

70
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:46,072
because some of us
work even harder.

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,220
Not a word.
Not a word!

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,814
<i>You're doing
great, hon, stay with me, okay?</i>

73
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,750
I'm gonna need you
to breathe out for me...

74
00:03:57,818 --> 00:03:59,118
Nice.

75
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:00,853
<i>Four minutes</i>
<i>between contractions,</i>

76
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:02,154
<i>which is awesome.</i>

77
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:03,489
I'm sending all this
to the paramedics

78
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:06,025
as soon as they get there...

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,362
<i>Which will be in two minutes,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

80
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,497
<i>You got a name picked out</i>
<i>for the little man yet?</i>

81
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:13,932
So slow...

82
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,734
I think one of the servers
needs rebooting.

83
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,101
Can you do it?

84
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,603
I'm wrapping up
the miracle of life over here.

85
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,429
Yes.

86
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,239
<i>You got a bag
packed for the hospital?</i>

87
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,641
<i>Now don't worry.</i>

88
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,209
<i>I'm gonna stay right here</i>
<i>with you...</i>

89
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:38,121
Aw...

90
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:40,023
<i>I know.</i>

91
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:41,692
<i>Man, getting
married and going to work,</i>

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,360
that is dedication.

93
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:45,328
Well, it's the only day
Sam's dad could be here.

94
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:48,565
You know, reception's
at the party boat tonight.

95
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:50,132
I wish I could've been there.

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,468
Me too.

97
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:52,736
Spike, you were there.

98
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:53,837
No, I mean I wish

99
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:55,972
you could've been there
too, too.

100
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,607
"Too, too?"

101
00:04:57,675 --> 00:05:00,208
"Too, too," as in too, also.

102
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:01,243
Gotcha.

103
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:04,279
SRU.

104
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,514
<i>Hey, Winnie,
this is Nina from 911.</i>

105
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,015
Hey, Nina.
What's going on?

106
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,149
We've got something
in our server room

107
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:09,217
that doesn't look like it
should be there.

108
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:11,186
911's got a problem.

109
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:12,821
Nina, I've got team one here.

110
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,055
<i>It's some kind
of a device in a box,</i>

111
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:15,456
in our server room.

112
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,692
It's got exposed wires
and a blinking light.

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,627
Was it left in plain sight?

114
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,928
<i>No. No, it was concealed
in one of our server cabinets.</i>

115
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:22,630
We only found it
when we went to do a reboot.

116
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,765
<i>Get any non-essential
staff out of there,</i>

117
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:25,232
we're on our way.

118
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,667
<i>Winnie, call Stainton,</i>

119
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:27,869
get him to see if there's
a spike in terrorist chatter.

120
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:29,637
You got it.

121
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,305
<i>Spike?</i>

122
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,473
Just... you know.

123
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,175
I'm always careful.

124
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:48,821
Hitting 911?

125
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,689
The nerve centre for
the city's emergency services.

126
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:51,925
We can't shut the place down

127
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:52,992
without leaving the city
stranded.

128
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,094
Babycakes is ready to roll.

129
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,496
Ma'am, they are
on their way right now,

130
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:59,165
so I'm gonna need you
to calm down for me, okay?

131
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,766
We're down to three
operators and three dispatch.

132
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,501
The evac'd staff is out front.

133
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,036
'Kay, Leah, let's check
out the rest of the building.

134
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:05,870
I'm gonna talk to staff,
start profiling.

135
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,472
We're gonna
need CCTV footage.

136
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,839
- Already pulled it.
- Great.

137
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,078
<i>You're husband is pinned by the
steering wheel,</i><i>is that correct?</i>

138
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:23,921
Howie? Howie, give
Ethan his blankie back, please.

139
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,423
Howie? I need you to listen,
okay?

140
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,058
That belongs to Ethan, honey.

141
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,159
Fine!

142
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,661
Thank you, Howie, good choice.

143
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,501
Let's go! Back at school!
Here we come!

144
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,211
<i>I see the box.</i>

145
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,779
Sending out electronic
counter-measures

146
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:52,047
against remote detonation.

147
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:56,285
Ha! See, Ethan?
I told you we'd find it.

148
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:57,819
Run!

149
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:00,089
There you are!

150
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,168
911, what is your emergency?
Simcoe and Wellington?

151
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:16,637
How many are injured?
How many do you see?

152
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:18,373
What's going on?

153
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,741
911, what is your emergency?

154
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,977
It's a federal building,
Health and Welfare.

155
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,079
Team, we're looking
at another bomb

156
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,580
that just went off downtown.

157
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,982
<i>Mass casualties</i>
<i>in a busy building...</i>

158
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,984
<i>No way this was accidental.</i>

159
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,752
We are looking at terror.

00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:11,741
but it appears that
the explosion took place...

164
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,376
Spike, talk to me.

165
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:14,977
I'm working it, but
this is gonna take time.

166
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:16,279
Guys, go.
I got this.

167
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:17,380
No, Spike, listen...

168
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:18,781
Ed, go!

169
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,560
Okay, copy!
Guys, Simcoe and Wellington.

170
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,118
Sam, you're with me.
Let's move!

171
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,254
<i>We're gonna need
all emergency personnel</i>

172
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:26,522
<i>on standby.</i>

173
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,590
Crowd control,
casualty transport.

174
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,124
Okay, thank you.

175
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:32,059
Nina, all of you have
to get outside

176
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:33,795
with the rest of your staff.

177
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:34,996
We can split some of
the load with Durham Region,

178
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,331
<i>but then they'll be overloaded.</i>

179
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,565
<i>We need to stay</i>
<i>and keep answering calls.</i>

180
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:38,866
Negative. This bomb could
still go off.

181
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,468
The bomb could still go off,

182
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,504
but people definitely need
our help.

183
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,971
<i>It's not just our lives</i>
<i>on the line.</i>

184
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,576
Okay.

185
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,211
Winnie, I'm not liking the way
this day is going.

186
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,814
<i>I need all SRU teams reupped</i>
<i>right now.</i>

187
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,349
You got it.

188
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:58,218
The X-ray is up.

189
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:01,887
I see batteries, I see wires,
I see a timer...

190
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:04,324
And I got anti-handling
measures.

191
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,593
This is gonna
complicate things.

192
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:09,429
<i>Please, ma'am,
stay where you...</i>

193
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,599
<i>Everything's fine, dad.</i>

194
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,834
Just making sure you guys
got all checked in okay.

195
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,068
We're gonna see you
at the hotel

196
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,438
<i>after work, all right?</i>

197
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:20,806
Bye, dad.

198
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,476
You'd do anything to just...
Wrap 'em up

199
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:26,077
and keep 'em safe.

200
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,447
Your parents were in Haiti
during the earthquake, right?

201
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,282
All you can do is do your best.

202
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:34,352
Yup.

203
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,222
No, Sophie, I'm okay.
I'm okay.

204
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,423
Look, I'm sure Clark's
okay, too.

205
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,758
He's probably
just somewhere noisy,

206
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:42,326
where he can't hear his phone,
all right?

207
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:43,594
<i>I need you to call me</i>

208
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:45,396
as soon as you hear from him,
okay?

209
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:47,197
I love you.

210
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:48,231
She heard about the bomb?

211
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:49,532
Yeah.

212
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,267
Guess your wife knows
where you are.

213
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:52,435
"Wife."

214
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:54,203
Feels funny, huh?

215
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:55,739
It feels good.

216
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:57,340
No chemical
detection, no nerve agents,

217
00:09:57,408 --> 00:10:00,009
no blood agents, no radiation.

218
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,811
I'm going in manual.

219
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:16,892
24 minutes.

220
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,727
<i>Okay.</i>

221
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,227
Can you sever the power source?

222
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,129
Yeah, I think so,
but it's underneath.

223
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:23,498
I can't reach it
without triggering

224
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:26,233
the anti-handling device
embedded in the C4.

225
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,770
<i>I'm gonna have to disable it</i>
<i>by hand.</i>

226
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:45,184
It's a Mercury tilt switch.

227
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,188
<i>That drop slides over</i>
<i>by a hair,</i>

228
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:52,591
and touches those two wires,
and I lose my 24 minutes.

229
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,159
<i>22 minutes.</i>

230
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,661
How do you disable
a Mercury tilt switch?

231
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:56,929
Acetone.

232
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:58,196
And where are we gonna
get that?

233
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:05,871
Anybody have
any nail Polish remover?

234
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,639
Seriously!
Anybody?!

235
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:11,175
Thanks!

236
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,978
Ed, that was Stainton.

237
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,480
<i>There's been no chatter-spike</i>
<i>on the terrorist channels.</i>

238
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:16,748
<i>Okay. Thanks, Winnie.</i>

239
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,215
So if it is
a coordinated strike,

240
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:19,717
it's a group
that's not on our radar.

241
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:21,953
Or it's a lone wolf
with no group to chatter with.

242
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,754
All right, assuming
it's the same individual,

243
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:25,656
what's his next step?

244
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:27,090
He hit the heart of the city's
defense system

245
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:28,391
and a symbol of government.

246
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,827
It sounds more political
than personal.

247
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,662
He wants to show he can make
a whole city vulnerable.

248
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,096
Well, if it is
statement oriented,

249
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:34,431
he'll come out
from behind the curtain,

250
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:35,999
and share his world view.

251
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,168
<i>Spike, what's going on?</i>

252
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:39,735
Submerging the
Mercury in acetone.

253
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,236
<i>Two minutes,</i>

254
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:42,237
<i>I'm moving the rest</i>
<i>of these people outta here,</i>

255
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:43,506
<i>unless you tell me different.</i>

256
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:44,540
<i>Copy that.</i>

257
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:49,946
Adding dry ice
to lower the temperature.

258
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,193
Minus 36 degrees...

259
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,828
Two more degrees
and the Mercury freezes over.

260
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,834
Come on... come on...

261
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:15,203
<i>Come on!</i>

262
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,471
<i>Come on!</i>

263
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:19,140
Minus 38.8 degrees.

264
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,977
<i>Going for the power source.</i>

265
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:25,981
<i>I see it.</i>

266
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:30,117
Cutting the power supply.

267
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,021
Done!
We're clear!

268
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,158
<i>Call centre's
back in business.</i>

269
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,563
We're okay;

270
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:45,532
the bomb's disabled,
your colleagues can come back.

271
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,794
Okay, Jules, Leah, help
EMS identify the wounded,

272
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,161
30 seconds per patient.

273
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,263
Sam, same thing inside -
find survivors.

274
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,765
Go!

275
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:29,273
Guys, remember, four

276
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,608
Green is for minor injuries;

277
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,609
<i>yellow is for urgent;</i>

278
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,009
red is for immediate.

279
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:34,644
Black's for dead.

280
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:36,846
Or beyond saving -
it's a judgment call here.

281
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:39,049
Sir! Sir!
Can you hear me?

282
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,384
Check his pulse.

283
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,720
Sir, I need you
to close your eyes, please.

284
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,321
Okay, he's in shock.
Raise his legs.

285
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,824
- Let's put this under.
- All right, gently.

286
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:49,491
We
got a red here!

287
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,993
Tag and move!
Let's go!

288
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:53,028
Let's move!
Let's move!

289
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:29,596
911, what is your emergency?

290
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,097
911, what is your emergency?

291
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,332
Where are you located, sir?

292
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,434
Okay, is anyone with you
right now?

293
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:38,271
- No, stay on the line with me.
- Breathe...

294
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,839
What are you
thinking, Spike?

295
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:40,906
I'm thinking one bomb,
that's probably your day.

296
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:42,242
Two bombs...

297
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:44,909
I think your day
might not be over.

298
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:46,553
Let's figure out who made this.

299
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:47,779
Copy that.

300
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:51,483
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

301
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:53,252
Ma'am, can you hear me?

302
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:55,020
Are you able to walk?

303
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:57,722
We've got a yellow!

304
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,290
All right,
paramedics are coming.

305
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,724
You're gonna be just fine,
okay?

306
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:04,662
- Let's go.
- Just keep on breathing.

307
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:10,568
All right, hold her neck.

308
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:12,102
<i>Ma'am, can you hear me?</i>

309
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,804
Ethan...

310
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:14,905
Ethan...

311
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:17,174
<i>Ethan...</i>

312
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:24,681
Okay... hi, honey.

313
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,284
My name is Jules.

314
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:29,986
I'm gonna help you, okay?

315
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:57,071
I'm so sorry...
I'm so sorry, honey.

316
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:02,250
<i> Jules!</i>

317
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,318
She says there's a daycare
in there.

318
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:06,253
There's more kids!

319
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,455
<i>Ed! Inside!</i>
<i>There's a daycare!</i>

320
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,123
<i>Copy! Sam, check
the floorplans;</i>

321
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:10,957
<i>we gotta get there.</i>

322
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:12,926
I'm on it!

323
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:15,993
<i>Ma'am, somebody's gonna
be right with you, all right?</i>

324
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,566
Is this the daycare?

325
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:20,834
I can hear a woman, kids.

326
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:22,769
Somebody might be hurt,
I can't be sure.

327
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:25,905
Hello!
This is the police!

328
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,007
<i>We're gonna help you!</i>
<i>Can you hear us?</i>

329
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:30,076
Guys, the daycare's front
door's fifteen feet in.

330
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:31,778
They can't hear us
with all this debris.

331
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:33,346
Controlled demolition
to open the way?

332
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,480
<i>Sam, we can't do it.</i>

333
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:36,849
It's too unstable.
We gotta go in.

334
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,017
<i>Sasha, please, honey, stay calm all right?</i>

335
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,685
You gonna fit
through that hole?

336
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:41,553
<i>We're gonna
get outta here, okay?</i>

337
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,155
I'm gonna try.

338
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:50,929
Ed, there's no
way, it's too risky!

339
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:52,797
<i>Just... just leave Howie!</i>

340
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:54,431
<i>Look, he can't move right now.</i>

341
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,666
<i>He's... he's sleeping.</i>

342
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:56,667
Okay,
there's a kid...

343
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:58,369
There's a kid pinned down
in there.

344
00:16:58,436 --> 00:17:00,138
I'm small enough;
I can fit through that hole.

345
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:01,873
Jules, the structure's
been compromised here.

346
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,808
We can't let you go in,
it might collapse.

347
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:05,342
I can do this!

348
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,710
Jules, stop. We'll
find another way.

349
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:07,745
Sam, you've
gotta let me do this!

350
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:08,678
Jules, you're not
thinking straight!

351
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:09,780
There are children in there

352
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:10,781
and we are running out of time!

353
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:12,282
Now, Sam, right now,

354
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,285
are you my teammate
or my husband?!

355
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,158
I can do this.

356
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,625
Let's go. Let's go.

357
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:26,328
Hello!
I'm coming in!

358
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,521
<i>What's happening here?</i>

359
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:55,856
Oh my God...

360
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,265
Oh my God...

361
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,934
Another bomb's gone off!

362
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,438
Sir, could you
repeat that, please?

363
00:18:11,505 --> 00:18:13,005
I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm
having trouble hearing you,

364
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:15,107
<i>did you say City Hall?</i>

365
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:18,978
<i>Sergeant,</i>

366
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,579
we have a man
claiming responsibility.

367
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:23,182
He wants to talk
to the "decisionmaker."

368
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,619
This is sergeant Greg Parker

369
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:30,322
with the police Strategic
Response Unit.

370
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,423
<i>Your rank doesn't impress me.</i>

371
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:33,825
<i>Are you the one</i>
<i>running the show?</i>

372
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,361
Sir, very busy down here.
I'm gonna have to hang up

373
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:38,763
if I'm not convinced you are
what you say you are.

374
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:41,066
I'm gonna give you ten seconds.
Nine, eight...

375
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,700
<i>The building
you're in is still standing.</i>

376
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:43,701
<i>Nice work, puppet.</i>

377
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:44,935
I'm listening.

378
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:46,170
<i>Three bombs...</i>

379
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:47,037
<i>You think it ends there,</i>
<i>but it doesn't.</i>

380
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:48,472
Whoa...

381
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,040
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

382
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:51,375
Sir, there are more bombs?
How many more?

383
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:52,709
<i>Lots more.</i>

384
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:53,777
<i>Shouldn't be long</i>
<i>'til the next one.</i>

385
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:55,212
How long, sir?

386
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,780
<i>About half an hour,</i>

387
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:58,582
<i>and one after that,</i>
<i>and after that...</i>

388
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,183
Look, who is this?

389
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:03,753
Who is this?!

390
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,455
You're talking to the one
running the show.

391
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,689
<i>A second
detonation in the downtown core</i>

392
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,859
<i>has given weight</i>
<i>to the speculation</i>

393
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,626
<i>that these incidents</i>
<i>are terror-related.</i>

394
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,362
But we repeat,

395
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,565
this is only speculation
at this point.

396
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:31,402
<i>All non-critical casualties</i>
<i>are being transported...</i>

397
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,505
<i>But what's available?</i>

398
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,108
Every truck you can spare,
every ambulance, every crew,

399
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,209
we need them on the road
to Toronto immediately.

400
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,577
<i>I understand.</i>

401
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:42,079
All right, team,
they've just upgraded this thing

402
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:44,447
to a category one emergency.

403
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:46,383
<i>Fire and EMS from Durham</i>
<i>are on their way.</i>

404
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,151
<i>We're reaching out to Halton,</i>
<i>Peel and York.</i>

405
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:49,652
<i>It's all hands on deck.</i>

406
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,121
Have you contacted
the military?

407
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,992
Yeah, we've got
units from CFB Borden.

408
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,494
They're gonna control
the streets

409
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:59,863
and set up a mass casualty
triage at the stadium,

410
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,865
<i>all the hospitals</i>
<i>are gonna be over capacity.</i>

411
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,433
Ed, I've got
your wife on the line.

412
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,667
Winnie, tell her I'll
call her as soon as I can.

413
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,035
Tell her what's going on here.

414
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:07,871
<i>Spike, what're we looking at?</i>

415
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:09,939
I can't trace it.
It's a disposable cell.

416
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,607
The voice has been
digitally altered.

417
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:12,841
<i>I can't unscramble it</i>

418
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,109
but it's a fair guess
it's a "he."

419
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,110
That narrows it down.

420
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:16,344
Anything in the background?

421
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:17,312
No. I've filtered it,
I've boosted it,

422
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,980
but all I'm getting is him.

423
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:21,182
<i>Your rank
doesn't impress me.</i>

424
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,885
<i>Are you the one</i>
<i>running the show?</i>

425
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:24,887
He hates authority.
He's setting his own terms.

426
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:26,154
<i>The building
you're in is still standing.</i>

427
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:27,254
<i>Nice work, puppet!</i>

428
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:28,255
"Puppet."

429
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:30,725
He's the master...

430
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:32,527
And he's pulling all
the strings.

431
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,000
Hello!

432
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:42,136
Can you hear me?!

433
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:43,169
<i>Hey!
Hey! Over here!</i>

434
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:44,337
What's your name?!

435
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:45,839
- <i>- Della!</i>

436
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:47,908
Della, my name's Jules.
My team's here.

437
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:49,742
We're gonna come get you, okay?

438
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,009
<i>There's a hurt
little boy in here!</i>

439
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:52,210
<i>Please hurry!</i>

440
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:53,779
Careful, Jules.

441
00:20:58,985 --> 00:20:59,985
Jules!

442
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:02,154
Jules, what's going on?!

443
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:06,157
I'm okay.

444
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,327
<i>Rebar dug into my leg.</i>
<i>I'm okay.</i>

445
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:19,704
Dean. Son.

446
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,972
Dad.

447
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,574
You didn't answer.
I just...

448
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:24,741
We didn't know.

449
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:25,576
<i>I'm fine, I'm fine.</i>

450
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:26,977
Ed?

451
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,311
<i>Ed's fine,
we're all fine.</i>

452
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:29,513
How about you?
You're still at school, right?

453
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,848
It's study day, remember?

454
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,450
I'm downtown with Mira,
we're shopping for prom.

455
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:34,518
Where are you?

456
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,552
<i>I'm on Gerrard.</i>

457
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,953
Is Clark with you?

458
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,187
He was.
He split off, dad.

459
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,288
He went to get a permit.

460
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:40,656
A permit for what?

461
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:41,991
For the prom -
that outdoor party.

462
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:43,025
Do you know where?

463
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,159
<i>No.</i>

464
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:45,561
Did you try his cell?

465
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:47,563
Yeah, no answer.
Dad, what's going on?

466
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:49,398
Everybody's freaking out,
they're saying it's terrorism.

467
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:50,900
Dean, we're figuring
it out, buddy, all right?

468
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:52,301
I want you and Mira
to go to the station.

469
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:53,334
<i>Wait for me there.</i>

470
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:54,094
Okay.

471
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:56,070
<i>Don't go into the subways
and avoid public buildings,</i>

472
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:57,071
you hear me?

473
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:58,473
<i>Avoid public buildings.</i>

474
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,775
Just keep your eyes open,
all right?

475
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:02,010
Dean?

476
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,079
Dean. Deano!

477
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:08,883
Hey, we just lost a whole
cell phone zone downtown.

478
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,484
Lines are overloaded.

479
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:11,819
That's just gonna
accelerate everybody.

480
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:12,586
That's just
what our guy wants...

481
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:14,221
Fear for fear's sake.

482
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:15,355
What if we make a
public announcement on TV,

483
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:16,690
acknowledge
what's happening here.

484
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:17,758
It'll make our
guy even happier.

485
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:18,726
More attention,
more validation,

486
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:20,394
more mass panic.

487
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:21,428
But if we don't
warn people to be vigilant,

488
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:22,530
we could be putting them
at risk.

489
00:22:22,597 --> 00:22:24,597
Fear's about
not having answers.

490
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:26,165
Winnie,
get me the mayor's office.

491
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:27,567
We need to go public, now.

492
00:22:27,635 --> 00:22:29,068
Someone needs to talk
to the city.

493
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:30,637
<i>Copy.</i>

494
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,641
I see it! The
daycare's up ahead.

495
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,244
<i>We're gonna be okay.</i>

496
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:39,646
<i>We're gonna get outta here</i>
<i>and we're gonna be okay.</i>

497
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,714
There's someone here!

498
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:44,016
Oh, thank God!

499
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,984
Oh my God!
You have to help him!

500
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:48,820
Please! Please!
You have to help him!

501
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:50,121
He's stuck there!
Please!

502
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:51,557
Della. Della!

503
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:53,258
Della, stop it!
Look at me.

504
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:54,225
You've held it together
for these kids

505
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:55,827
this long, okay?

506
00:22:55,895 --> 00:22:57,127
You just need to keep on
doing that.

507
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:58,896
Just keep breathing.

508
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:00,064
You got it.

509
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:01,131
Let's go.
Okay...

510
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,200
Come on, come on.

511
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:10,240
Hi, honey.
Can you talk to me?

512
00:23:12,177 --> 00:23:14,210
Buddy?

513
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:15,879
Buddy!

514
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:19,282
Hi! Hi. Are you okay?

515
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:20,584
<i>I'm gonna get you outta here.</i>

516
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:25,689
All right, Della,
I want you to gather the kids,

517
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,057
<i>get them ready.</i>

518
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:30,759
When I get our friend out,
we're gonna go.

519
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,628
Wanna see how strong I am?

520
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:34,029
Yeah?

521
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:35,464
It's gonna
be okay, all right?

522
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:36,832
<i>We're gonna go home soon.</i>

523
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,200
<i>I'm scared.</i>

524
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,405
Ungh!
That's my Jack!

525
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:45,539
Let's see how strong I am.

526
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,880
- Do you feel that?
- Mm-hmm.

527
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:54,082
Good. Can you move your legs?

528
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:55,549
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

529
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,722
Let's get you to your mom.
How 'bout that?

530
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:03,624
He's okay.
Let's go.

531
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:05,525
<i>I miss my mom.</i>

532
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:08,194
<i>Let's go! We're gonna
get you outta here, okay?</i>

533
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:11,832
Yes, sir, I understand.
I will do my best.

534
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:13,533
The mayor got caught
in the blast at city hall.

535
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:14,868
He's being treated.

536
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:16,236
The deputy mayor
wants a uniform

537
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:17,469
to talk to the city.

538
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:19,338
Boss, no one better.

539
00:24:20,273 --> 00:24:22,608
Let's get you set up.

540
00:25:19,196 --> 00:25:21,897
<i>We go now to this
critical incident's officer in charge,</i>

541
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:23,531
Sergeant Gregory Parker

542
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,802
from the police service's
Strategic Response Unit.

543
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:28,203
Sergeant?

544
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,637
You're probably aware

545
00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:32,507
that the city's facing
an emergency situation;

546
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:34,976
two explosions
right in the heart of our city.

547
00:25:35,044 --> 00:25:36,477
I want you to know

548
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:38,012
that we've got a lot
of good folks on the case,

549
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,647
<i>responders from the city</i>
<i>and from surrounding regions</i>

550
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:43,017
<i>are all working together</i>
<i>to keep you safe,</i>

551
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,519
and to keep everything
under control.

552
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,021
<i>Now, you're gonna hear</i>
<i>a lot of speculation</i>

553
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,756
<i>and maybe some rumours,</i>

554
00:25:48,824 --> 00:25:51,592
'cause that's just what happens
<i>in a situation like this,</i>

555
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,893
and some of it may be alarming.

556
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:56,763
But I wanna tell you
that the best way to stay safe

557
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,933
is to stay calm and to look out
after each other.

558
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,235
Highways, roads, cell phones,
911...

559
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:04,503
Please use these as sparingly
as you can

560
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:07,006
because if these systems
are overloaded

561
00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:08,774
they will shut down.

562
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,676
<i>Today is the kind of day</i>

563
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:13,078
<i>that we'll all look back at,</i>
<i>years from now,</i>

564
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:14,579
<i>and remember exactly</i>
<i>where we were</i>

565
00:26:14,647 --> 00:26:16,849
<i>and what we did.</i>

566
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,283
<i>We have a chance</i>
<i>to make choices here</i>

567
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:20,619
<i>that we will be proud of.</i>

568
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:23,622
<i>Today's the day that we did</i>
<i>not let fear break us down,</i>

569
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:25,757
<i>and turn us against each other.</i>

570
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:29,293
This was the day
that we took care of each other.

571
00:26:30,328 --> 00:26:33,597
<i>The day that we said no</i>
<i>to terror,</i>

572
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:34,966
together.

573
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,570
<i>I want us all to think about</i>

574
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:41,437
<i>how we want to remember</i>
<i>this day.</i>

575
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:44,407
<i>It's up to us.</i>

576
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:48,745
<i>I want to thank you</i>
<i>for your attention,</i>

577
00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:51,714
<i>and for your courage.</i>

578
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:54,317
<i>Thank you, sergeant Parker.
We return now to our live...</i>

579
00:26:54,385 --> 00:26:56,552
What'd you think, Spike?
Cheesy?

580
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,053
Not cheesy, boss.

581
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,697
You gotta stay off this leg.

582
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:10,065
How's the pain?

583
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,667
Pain's pain.

584
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:15,270
Well, what do mean
the boys are downtown?

585
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:16,905
<i>Parker they went shopping
together, then Clark split off.</i>

586
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:18,372
That's all I know.

587
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,607
Well, did he say
where he was going?

588
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:21,042
To get a permit for a party.

589
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,443
Greg, that's at a
municipal building.

590
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:25,079
I, I... I haven't been able
to get a hold of him.

591
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:27,481
Eddie, I'm sure he's fine.
It's probably cell towers.

592
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:28,783
Well...
Well, what am I gonna do?

593
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,317
What do I...
What am I gonna say to Sophie?

594
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:31,551
<i>Look, Ed,</i>

595
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:32,786
just wait till we have
more information,

596
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:34,387
before she gets worried
for nothing.

597
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:35,923
Ed! Okay, I'll figure it out.

598
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,157
I gotta go.
Yeah?

599
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:37,925
<i>I got a casualty report.</i>

600
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:39,092
What do we got?

601
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,627
Forty-one green,
eleven yellow,

602
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:43,163
seventeen red,
and too many dead.

603
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:44,397
Whoever did this...

604
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:46,132
Is gonna get his ass
nailed to the wall.

605
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,800
Okay. Thanks, Leah.

606
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,068
Hey. We're done tagging.

607
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,069
They want us over
at the next bomb site,

608
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:52,238
- priority one.
- Okay.

609
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,472
What?

610
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,440
It's Clark.
He's at a municipal building

611
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,842
and I haven't heard from him.

612
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:57,009
- City Hall?
- Donna, I don't know.

613
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,277
Ed, I'm headed there.

614
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,946
I'll call you as soon
as I can, okay?

615
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,847
Come on,
what're the odds, right?

616
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,014
Okay.

617
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,216
I'll call you when I get there.

618
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,617
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
All right?

619
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,461
How's the leg, Jules?

620
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,428
Did you talk to your folks?

621
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:17,662
I can't get a hold of 'em.

622
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,696
I'm sure they're fine, though.

623
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,631
Yeah.
How are you?

624
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,200
We're good.

625
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,506
So you still haven't heard
from him at all?

626
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:29,741
I haven't.

627
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,409
It's not like him,
not this long.

628
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:32,543
Well, you know, Soph,
like I said, he's probably...

629
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,143
Probably just got
his headphones on, so...

630
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:36,145
<i>Ed, I'm worried.
Why hasn't he called?</i>

631
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:37,514
I mean,
what if something happened?

632
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,215
Soph, we're gonna
get him home okay.

633
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:40,550
He's gonna be fine.

634
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,018
<i>Guys, check your inboxes.</i>

635
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:43,787
<i>Soph, I gotta go.
I love you.</i>

636
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,422
Okay.

637
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,590
<i>52 Division just
forwarded an email</i>

638
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,425
from the guy claiming
to be the bomber.

639
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,859
It comes with a tube link.

640
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:51,627
Claims to be his manifesto.

641
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:53,295
He sent a tube link
to the police?

642
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:54,463
No, to the media outlets,
and they sent it to us.

643
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:58,267
I like to think of
myself as a thought-provoker,

644
00:28:58,334 --> 00:28:59,802
a provocateur.

645
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,270
<i>But to provoke thought,</i>

646
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:03,572
<i>first I need to get</i>
<i>your full attention.</i>

647
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,574
We live in media-saturated,
technology-fractured,

648
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:08,710
short-attention-span times;

649
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:11,012
it's not easy to secure
an audience.

650
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,980
I hope
what I set in motion today

651
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:14,582
has succeeded on that front.

652
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,718
This thing goes
on for 47 minutes.

653
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,622
Can you track the
computer he posted that from?

654
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:21,722
<i>No; He's transcoded the video...</i>

655
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,457
I can't get
to the original file,

656
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,358
<i>and it looks like he put it up</i>
<i>using a dummy account.</i>

657
00:29:25,427 --> 00:29:26,527
It's totally anonymous.

658
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:28,061
How do you know
it was a dummy account?

659
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:30,163
Because he called it
dummy, underscore, account.

660
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:32,466
<i>Did the email itself
come from the same computer?</i>

661
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:33,901
<i>Well, he's been so
careful to cover his tracks,</i>

662
00:29:33,968 --> 00:29:35,001
I can't see-

663
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:36,603
Hold on a second.

664
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:38,170
<i>I think he slipped up.</i>

665
00:29:38,238 --> 00:29:40,105
This publicity thing,
he sent it from a smart phone.

666
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:41,507
I can back-track that.

667
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:42,875
<i>I can get you a number.</i>

668
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:45,611
<i>Phone number is 555-0193.</i>

669
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:48,514
I might be able
to get a location too.

670
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,716
No. He's turned off
the GPS, but we can still get a name.

671
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:52,217
Winnie?

672
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:54,018
The smart phone is registered
to an Anson P. Holt.

673
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:55,720
I'm sending his address
to you now.

674
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:56,721
Ed! Let's move,
let's go!

675
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:58,356
Boss?

676
00:29:58,424 --> 00:29:59,290
<i>Yeah, Jules,
you stay off that leg.</i>

677
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:00,759
<i>I need your help profiling.</i>

678
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:02,060
<i>Let's figure out</i>
<i>who our "thought provoker" is,</i>

679
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:03,962
maybe we can figure out
where his bombs are.

680
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:05,229
Copy.

681
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:06,832
<i>Ed, I'm on my way!</i>

682
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,967
Boss, these bombs are
a half hour apart.

683
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,133
If he's sticks
to his promise...

684
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:11,802
I know;

685
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,637
eleven minutes
till the next one blows.

686
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,125
- Clear!
- Clear!

687
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:31,627
<i>- Clear!</i>
<i>- Clear!</i>

688
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:33,462
<i>Greg, he's not here.</i>

689
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,364
<i>Boss, I think he
sees this as taking a stand</i>

690
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:36,799
for personal freedom;

691
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:38,800
the liberty of the individual
against control...

692
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:40,268
<i>any kind of control.</i>

693
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:41,570
He wants to show we can
all fight back

694
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:43,505
by claiming our own
personal autonomy.

695
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:45,307
<i>Cut the puppet strings.
I get it, Jules,</i>

696
00:30:45,374 --> 00:30:47,742
but it's just general
theoretical justification.

697
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,211
<i>Yeah, but look,</i>

698
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:50,978
he actually lists the forces
he's fighting against.

699
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:53,047
Each one gets a graphic.

700
00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:56,250
What if each one is a target
he's planning on hitting?

701
00:30:56,318 --> 00:30:58,720
The Government
Federal Building.

702
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:02,056
Just like a security blanket,
the safety is all an illusion,

703
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:03,524
<i>and the child</i>
<i>that depends on it</i>

704
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:05,526
<i>will soon be forced to grow up.</i>

705
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:07,095
"Communications"...

706
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:08,562
That's what he calls the city's
"security blanket."

707
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,731
Well, that's 911 -
the people who keep us safe.

708
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:12,432
Petty politics?

709
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,533
City Hall.

710
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:14,600
It's all lining up.

711
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,636
How many forces is
this guy fighting against?

712
00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:20,440
<i>Seven, eight, nine...</i>

713
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:22,375
We got ten targets.

714
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:24,778
Okay, we're onto this bastard.
Good work, Jules.

715
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:26,512
But that doesn't
tell us where the bombs are.

716
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,047
<i>"Justice" can mean</i>
<i>any courthouse.</i>

717
00:31:28,115 --> 00:31:30,682
<i>"Media" could mean</i>
<i>any television station.</i>

718
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:32,952
Anson Holt is a psychologist.

719
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,686
Go head, Winnie.

720
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:36,188
<i>He's a Professor
at Brookfield University.</i>

721
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:37,689
<i>Lots of publications,</i>
<i>major research grants,</i>

722
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:39,258
lecture tours...

723
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,860
And one of the highest
student ratings of the faculty.

724
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:42,261
<i>Oh! Correction.</i>

725
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:43,594
He was "let go"
from the university

726
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:44,595
five years ago.

727
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,552
Why?

728
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,932
No reason anyone was
willing to put on the record.

729
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,100
All right, get me the head
of the psychology department,

730
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:50,769
and I'll get it out of them.

731
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:51,936
Day like today, boss,
I'm gonna do my best, but...

732
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:54,072
Winnie, just find them.

733
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,807
Sorry, boss, will do.

734
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:04,782
Where the hell are you?

735
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:06,150
<i> Dad...</i>

736
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,218
Clark, what's going on?
Talk to me!

737
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,719
Talk to me.

738
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:12,156
<i> Can't move.</i>

739
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:13,257
Clark?

740
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,827
Clark, you're at City Hall?

741
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:21,563
Are you in City Hall?

742
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,399
Yes...

743
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:24,801
<i>Rush!</i>

744
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:26,135
Okay, okay, stay with me.

745
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:27,736
Can't...

746
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:29,772
<i>It's okay,
just stay with me.</i>

747
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,306
<i> I'm here.</i>

748
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:33,208
Call Donna, tell her
Clark's at City Hall.

749
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:34,542
Track his phone.

750
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:37,279
I'm coming to get you,
stay with me.

751
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,181
Boss, you copy that?

752
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,816
Yeah, I did, Spike.

753
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:46,154
Boss, there was a false back
on his office bookshelf.

754
00:32:46,222 --> 00:32:47,521
What was he hiding?

755
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:48,856
Some pretty disturbing books.

756
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:50,624
"Embracing sadism."
"The courage to dominate."

757
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:52,159
He's got a private
DVD collection,

758
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:53,794
plain covers.

759
00:32:53,862 --> 00:32:55,129
Hey, guys, I think
I found another target.

760
00:32:55,197 --> 00:32:56,763
<i>He's hit communications,</i>
<i>big government,</i>

761
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,165
<i>petty politics.</i>

762
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:00,034
But his biggest grudge to date
is education.

763
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:02,036
Listen to this.

764
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:04,704
Substitute "institution
of higher learning"

765
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:07,173
for "institution of conforming
and crushing."

766
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:09,075
I will crush you back.

767
00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:12,212
Crush you where it began
in that lab.

768
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,347
I will be watching you.

769
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:15,748
His old workplace,
where his grudge began.

770
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:17,483
We need to find that lab.

771
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:22,855
Clark, let me ask you,
do you feel any pain?

772
00:33:22,922 --> 00:33:26,524
Yeah, my side...
It hurts.

773
00:33:26,592 --> 00:33:28,626
Legs...
Legs are killing.

774
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:30,495
Pain's good, buddy. It
means your spine's okay.

775
00:33:30,563 --> 00:33:32,231
Now, Clark,
I know this hard,

776
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:33,465
but I need you
to just slow your breathing

777
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:35,466
right down for me.

778
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,434
Let's get that heart rate down,
<i>okay?</i>

779
00:33:37,502 --> 00:33:38,736
<i>It'll help you think straight,</i>

780
00:33:38,803 --> 00:33:40,037
<i>you're not gonna lose</i>
<i>so much blood.</i>

781
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,673
I taught you sniper breathing,
right, Clark?

782
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:46,410
Clark?

783
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:49,046
<i>Clark!</i>

784
00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:51,781
<i>I know it's hard for you</i>
<i>to speak, but...</i>

785
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:53,884
Clark, I know you can hear me.

786
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,920
You are such a strong kid
and I am so proud of you.

787
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:59,256
<i>Now, I need you to stay strong.</i>

788
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:00,857
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

789
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:03,493
I love you, buddy.
I love you.

790
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,529
Sarge, I tracked
down the Dean of Psychology,

791
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:08,730
Monica Butler.

792
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:09,664
That's fantastic, Winnie!

793
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:14,469
<i>Professor Butler?</i>

794
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:15,804
My name is
Sergeant Greg Parker.

795
00:34:15,872 --> 00:34:17,639
I'm with the police
Strategic Response Unit.

796
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:19,275
I need you to answer
a few questions.

797
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:20,809
Uh, yes, of course.

798
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:21,843
<i>Where's the
lab Anson Holt worked</i>

799
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:23,811
before he was fired?

800
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,846
Uh, that was the old
Casey Jeffers Building,

801
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:27,982
but that's not in use any more.
Why?

802
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,317
<i>Okay, just hold on the line.</i>

803
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:31,585
Winnie? I want a citywide search
for Anson Holt.

804
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,088
<i>Anyone who's not at a bombsite</i>
<i>is looking for this bastard.</i>

805
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,190
And which team is closest
to the Casey Jeffers Building

806
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:37,458
right now?

807
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:38,893
Donna. Team three.

808
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,227
Great. Donna, you hear me?

809
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:41,861
- Yeah, boss.
-  Clark!

810
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,063
<i>Donna, I need
you to get to that lab.</i>

811
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:44,564
There could be
another bomb there.

812
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm at City Hall
looking for Clark.

813
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,235
Anybody hear me?

814
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,937
<i>Donna, you're the closest
team to that site, all right?</i>

815
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,604
I'll be right behind you.

816
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,140
I know protocol,
boss, but this is Ed's kid.

817
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:55,374
Donna, I'm almost there.
You gotta go.

818
00:34:55,442 --> 00:34:57,243
Get to the lab -
priority of life.

819
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,678
Clark!
Eddie, I'm right here!

820
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:01,647
Donna, I got it.

821
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:02,915
Clark?

822
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:04,883
Donna, thank you
for everything.

823
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,285
Jimmy, we gotta go.

824
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:07,286
Team three, let's move!

825
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:08,754
Donna, stay safe.

826
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:10,589
Always, Eddie.

827
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:19,569
Everyone, you
are the heart and soul.

828
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,335
All of you, thank you.

829
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:31,575
Soph, we know where he is.

830
00:35:31,642 --> 00:35:33,377
<i>But listen to me...</i>

831
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:36,080
Sophie, he's hurt.
He's in one of the buildings.

832
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:37,982
Oh, Ed...

833
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:41,785
<i>Look, I know you're
scared and I'm scared too,</i>

834
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:43,453
but he's tough.

835
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,753
<i>Soph, he's tou...</i>

836
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:45,921
<i>Hold on, hold on, Soph.</i>

837
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,557
I got EMS.
Hold on, please.

838
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:49,892
Steve.

839
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,260
Ed, we tracked his cell signal

840
00:35:51,328 --> 00:35:52,728
to the second level
of the parking garage,

841
00:35:52,796 --> 00:35:55,164
but we haven't found him yet.

842
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,201
<i>Hold on! Ed! Ed!</i>
<i>I got the car.</i>

843
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:00,935
I'm sorry, Ed, but uh...

844
00:36:01,004 --> 00:36:02,837
<i>It's crushed under concrete.</i>

845
00:36:02,905 --> 00:36:04,206
It's not looking good.

846
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:05,940
Okay, I'm right there.

847
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:07,242
Soph?

848
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,610
Now, I'm gonna get him out.

849
00:36:08,677 --> 00:36:10,379
Now you gotta believe that,
'kay?

850
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:12,114
<i>I'm gonna bring him home,</i>
<i>okay, baby?</i>

851
00:36:26,528 --> 00:36:27,928
<i>Guys...</i>

852
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:30,031
I think I've got a positive ID
on Anson Holt.

853
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:31,564
<i>He's here at the lab.</i>

854
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:34,200
<i>All right, Donna,</i>

855
00:36:34,268 --> 00:36:35,235
there are bombs ticking down
all across this city;

856
00:36:35,302 --> 00:36:36,469
<i>no time for kid gloves.</i>

857
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:38,604
Copy. Go.

858
00:36:39,773 --> 00:36:41,541
Anson Holt, put your hands
where I can see them!

859
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:44,010
- SRU! On the ground!
- Police! Get down now!

860
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:46,346
Get down on the ground
right now!

861
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:47,646
Get on the ground!

862
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:49,915
Turn him.

863
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:53,118
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

864
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,458
You make one move I
don't tell you to make,

865
00:37:01,526 --> 00:37:02,626
you get shot,

866
00:37:02,694 --> 00:37:04,227
do you understand?

867
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:07,162
Do you understand?!

868
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:09,264
Good!

869
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,800
<i>Donna, what's going on?</i>

870
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,601
He's strapped to an
M112 demolition charge,

871
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:13,936
and he's watching
the whole city carnage

872
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:15,404
on his computer screens.

873
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:16,972
<i>Donna, I'm right behind you.</i>

874
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,508
Professor Butler,
why did Anson Holt get fired?

875
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,077
Ethical issues were
brought to our attention.

876
00:37:23,145 --> 00:37:24,512
Listen to me, Professor,
in under two minutes,

877
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,414
I'm gonna try to talk this man
out of blowing up

878
00:37:26,482 --> 00:37:28,817
more innocent civilians.

879
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:31,118
<i>Please just tell me</i>
<i>what happened in that lab.</i>

880
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:33,054
He was fired
because of a series

881
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:34,656
of psychologically abusive
experiments

882
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:37,658
that he performed there
on student volunteers.

883
00:37:37,726 --> 00:37:39,326
He was a sadist?

884
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:40,427
Yes.

885
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:45,031
One woman downrange,
the rest of you go.

886
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,367
Somebody's gotta cover him.

887
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:47,601
If he makes a play
when you're working...

888
00:37:47,669 --> 00:37:48,335
Okay, okay. Jimmy, stay.

889
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:49,670
The rest of you go.

890
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,273
You're gonna raise your arms,
very slowly,

891
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:57,176
away from your body,
into the air.

892
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,277
Do it.

893
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:06,218
You're gonna talk to me, Holt.

894
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:09,988
You tell me where
the rest of the bombs are!

895
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:13,692
Winnie!

896
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Are you okay?

897
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:15,761
Yeah, we're fine.

898
00:38:15,828 --> 00:38:17,095
Okay.

899
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,030
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

900
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,867
- Ed!
- Where is he?

901
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:24,703
The phone signal's here, man.
It's gotta be him.

902
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:26,371
Clark!

903
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:27,471
<i>Clark!</i>

904
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:33,278
Clark!

905
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:43,220
Spike, I got no timer.
I got C4 and wires.

906
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,722
This doesn't look like
your 911 bomb.

907
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,924
Donna, if there's no timer
on the bomb,

908
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,558
then you can wait
till I get there.

909
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,327
<i>No! I can handle it.</i>

910
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,798
How many wires do you see?

911
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,534
Uh...

912
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:00,403
Eighteen.

913
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,670
Arms up!

914
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:03,105
Okay, the bomb's exposed,
that's good.

915
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,808
<i>Now, just find the detonator.</i>

916
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,643
I don't see any detonator.

917
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,078
No, there's
gotta be a detonator.

918
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,346
I don't see
it, I'm looking.

919
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:11,380
Is this the fastest way?

920
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:12,714
It's the only way.

921
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:13,782
Every on ramp and highway
is jammed right now.

922
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,484
We're going as fast as we can.

923
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:17,419
<i>Donna, how's our subject</i>

924
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:19,721
Quiet, co-operative -
could be the gun on his head.

925
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,089
<i>Boss, this make
any sense to you?</i>

926
00:39:21,157 --> 00:39:22,190
If he was gonna blow
himself up,

927
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:23,792
why didn't he already do it?

928
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:27,262
This is your very last chance.

929
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,432
Tell me where the detonator is
right now!

930
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:33,267
Right now!

931
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:35,302
What're you looking at?

932
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,576
Team three, I'm here.
What do you see, Donna?

933
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:43,444
<i>I got a blinking
camera in the ceiling.</i>

934
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:48,782
Get outta there, now!

935
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:52,385
Move!

936
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:54,320
Aggghhhhhhhhhhhh!

937
00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:00,059
Boss!

938
00:40:12,138 --> 00:40:13,171
Boss!

939
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,474
I'm okay.

940
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:25,850
Holt wasn't the bomber.
He was the bait, Eddie.

941
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:29,453
She's gone, Eddie.

942
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:33,491
<i>She was right in front of him.</i>

943
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:38,762
Sonofabitch.

944
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:41,498
Sonofabitch!

945
00:40:55,157 --> 00:40:57,818
