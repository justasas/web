1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,351
Subject's in sight.

2
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:04,885
We are in pursuit heading
South on cherry street.

3
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:05,886
We need back up.

4
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:07,054
On our way.

5
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,638
Sergeant Robert
Gray, step out of the vehicle!

6
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:27,307
Hands where we can see them!

7
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,546
<i>That's it,
slow and steady!</i>

8
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:46,559
Spike, grenade!
Pull back!

9
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:07,411
So?

10
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,849
Here, here, here,
have a seat, have a seat.

11
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:14,351
I can sit.

12
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:15,519
Do you want me
to get you a tea?

13
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:17,020
Like an herbal tea
or somethin'?

14
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:19,855
I don't need an herbal tea,
I can sit,

15
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,123
and you're not allowed
to do that,

16
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:23,959
treat me like I need
bubble wrap or something.

17
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:25,928
I'm the same, okay?

18
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:27,896
I don't want you
to change on me.

19
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:29,265
Everything is the same.

20
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,166
So the doctor's sure.
There's...

21
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:32,801
Yeah, she's sure.

22
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:34,837
I can't even believe it.

23
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:35,870
I mean, like,
what are the chances?

24
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:37,805
We were so careful.
It's like...

25
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:39,641
Point zero-zero one per cent.

26
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,142
You've always been exceptional.

27
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:47,949
I don't wanna
let the team down.

28
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:51,119
Hey, don't worry
about the team, okay?

29
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:54,087
This is bigger.
How do you feel?

30
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,124
I feel really scared.

31
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:58,659
What else?

32
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:00,594
I can't believe...

33
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,296
Believe what?

34
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:09,369
I can't believe
how much I want this baby.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,641
Me too.

36
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,142
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:19,111
Yeah!

38
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:28,420
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

39
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:32,357
<i>So, this is the colour
you picked.</i>

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,094
Personally,
I think your taste is awful,

41
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:38,062
<i>probably from looking
at camouflage all day.</i>

42
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,131
So, I picked something else.

43
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:44,702
<i>Warm,</i>

44
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,637
strong,

45
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:48,339
and complex.

46
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:53,344
<i>You're probably wondering
how the other project is going.</i>

47
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:55,345
Six months.
It's amazing.

48
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:58,881
<i>He's moving so much.</i>

49
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,151
I wish you could feel him.

50
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,521
<i>Six months.</i>

51
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,656
<i>I miss you so much!</i>

52
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:08,591
I can't wait till you're home.

53
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,662
Sorry to interrupt,
but it's 0800.

54
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,497
Round everyone up?

55
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:18,534
Not a problem.
Briefing's in five minutes.

56
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,101
Camp and the others?

57
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,137
Picking up supplies;
They won't be back for an hour.

58
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:23,238
Good.

59
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,365
So what are the rules?

60
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,299
Well, officially,
I can stay on the force

61
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:53,868
right up until the end.

62
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:54,902
Yeah, sure, if
you're on a desk, but...

63
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,103
When are we gonna tell them?

64
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,438
Sam, it's too soon.
I'm only seven weeks.

65
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,373
Most people wait till after
the first trimester.

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,441
Most people don't
have your job.

67
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,043
I don't want
to say anything yet.

68
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,245
I don't want people
checking in,

69
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,680
getting all over-protective.

70
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,415
I don't want to throw anybody
off their game.

71
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,484
But you can't just pretend
nothing's changed.

72
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,986
Sam, look at me.

73
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,855
I'm just as qualified
as I was two months ago.

74
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,855
So this is just another day?

75
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,023
Yes.

76
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,624
Ready to keep the peace?

77
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,093
Let's do it!

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,995
Then gear up! We
hit the road in ten!

79
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,763
Let's let 'em know
we're out there!

80
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,810
Kondraski?

81
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:42,346
Caps, c4, plans, all set.

82
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:44,115
Bishop?

83
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,316
It's all locked up.
They'll be in position in 30.

84
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:46,951
Let's get there in 29.

85
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:58,828
What's up?

86
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:00,297
Are you sure?

87
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:01,298
What about?

88
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,399
Me.

89
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,867
Kondraski and bishop are solid,

90
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:07,669
but if this operation
goes South...

91
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,706
We need you.

92
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:13,108
I know you're gonna do your job
and keep us safe.

93
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,477
I wouldn't have asked you
if I didn't think so.

94
00:05:15,545 --> 00:05:16,645
You know that.

95
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:17,779
But what you also need to know

96
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:19,081
is that you will always
have a place here.

97
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:20,548
I will always be here for you,

98
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:23,584
whether you come now or not.

99
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:25,753
I just don't wanna
let you down, sir.

100
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,888
Doug, what's the first thing
I told you in basic training?

101
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:30,724
Sergeant's always right.

102
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,093
Well, right now
the sergeant's telling you

103
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:34,495
whatever choice you make,
that's the right one.

104
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,165
Let's go.

105
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:39,699
We take care of our own, right?

106
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:40,834
Right.

107
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,875
<i>Sid ah, traffic's bad all
the way out of town.</i>

108
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,477
Red lines are bad, right?

109
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:53,245
Yeah, either way,
we still get a layover.

110
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,448
A six-hour drive,
a night at a crap hotel,

111
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,683
followed by another
six-hour drive home.

112
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,585
Livin' the dream.

113
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:03,356
Geez.

114
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:07,159
Sir, I need to
know how long you're gonna be.

115
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:08,326
Uh, it's a fire Lane.

116
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:09,660
I'm just waiting for my guys.

117
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:11,596
Three minutes.

118
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,830
Ah!

119
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:14,699
How about less
than three minutes?

120
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,567
<i> One daley 13...</i>

121
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:18,036
We're all clear.

122
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:26,910
- Officer...
- Don't move!

123
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:27,844
No alarms!

124
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:29,313
Get down!

125
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:32,116
Do what we want,
no one gets hurt!

126
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,450
Team one, I got
a nervous dispatcher

127
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,519
over at Charleston security.

128
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:36,653
They're trying to get in touch

129
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:37,521
with one of their crews
downtown,

130
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,356
but it's gone quiet.

131
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:40,823
Charleston's got a whole
fleet of armoured trucks, right?

132
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:42,291
Yeah, this one
was out on a bank run.

133
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,293
They're supposed to be in
contact every 15 minutes,

134
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:45,928
but this one's running silent.

135
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:47,330
<i>Dispatcher can't raise 'em.</i>

136
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:48,597
Protocol is to call us.

137
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:49,932
Is this their route?

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,134
No, this is their last contact.

139
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,902
Their final stop
is supposed to be here.

140
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:54,070
439 Pearl.

141
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:55,505
Pretty narrow street.

142
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:57,039
Couldn't have picked
a better spot for a robbery.

143
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:58,941
Okay, spike, Sam, let's
start at temperance,

144
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:00,009
come in from the east.

145
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:01,076
<i>We'll come in from the west.</i>

146
00:07:01,144 --> 00:07:02,244
Boss, check in
at the last bank.

147
00:07:02,311 --> 00:07:04,311
They gotta be somewhere
in between.

148
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:07,082
Sarge, we gotta double time it!
Cops are on their way.

149
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,083
Charleston got in touch
with them

150
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,518
looking for the truck.

151
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:10,953
Okay, there's still time.
You know where to go.

152
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,454
Distract and
disable - on it!

153
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:17,159
This truck remind you
of anything?

154
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:18,993
A Humvee.

155
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:20,362
All it needs
is a turret on top.

156
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:28,202
You got this?

157
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:31,172
Yeah.

158
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,274
Just not a fan of tight spaces.

159
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,242
Drop safe walls
are three inches thick.

160
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,811
I won't go any
deeper than three and a half.

161
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,878
It's the wonder of c4.

162
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:42,716
Cops are on their way.

163
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:43,850
We've only got
a couple of minutes.

164
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,218
That's all we'll need.

165
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:46,820
Bishop, I need
you on the roof.

166
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:48,555
I'm good.

167
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:59,531
E-A's are set and ready.

168
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,954
In position for pick-up.
Status?

169
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,323
We're in.

170
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:35,032
In position.
All clear.

171
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:41,138
Hang on, we got trouble.

172
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,106
What do you see?

173
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,841
Sam, how close are you?

174
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:45,942
Cops.

175
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:48,911
Tops and tail.

176
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:50,113
<i>Alley's packed tight.</i>

177
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:52,782
In position.
Approach on foot?

178
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,416
No, let's take the trucks in
as far as we can.

179
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:55,451
If we run into any problem...

180
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,418
bottle 'em up tight.

181
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:57,419
Copy. Leah?

182
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:58,954
Nothing yet.

183
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,956
Kondraski?

184
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,659
Almost done.

185
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:04,527
<i>Almost is gonna
have to be enough.</i>

186
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:05,561
As soon as cover starts...

187
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,029
Back the way I came.
Ready.

188
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:08,997
There's supposed to be
two guards in that truck

189
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,232
at all times.

190
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,801
Cab of the truck looks empty.

191
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,403
Wait a second.
A single guard.

192
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:18,173
Not moving.

193
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,874
What, is he injured?
I don't know.

194
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:21,008
Bishop.

195
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,310
Ready.

196
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,713
Sam, spike,
let's move in fast!

197
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:29,917
Ed, we're movin' in now!

198
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,089
Nothing from the rear.
We'll...

199
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:42,362
Engine's cut!

200
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,830
Power's totally gone!

201
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,634
Incoming!

202
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:51,837
Taking fire!

203
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:54,340
We're taking fire!

204
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:55,808
Ed, we're blind here!

205
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,375
We got multiple gunshots!
We're under attack!

207
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,534
Winnie,
we need UNI's down there!

208
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:38,936
Tight perimeter!

209
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:40,771
No one approaches
until we've locked this down!

210
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,372
You got it, boss.

211
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,273
We're still blind.
Can't spot the shooter!

212
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,240
Spike?

213
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:45,708
Nothing!

214
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:48,577
Eddie, we're on
your end of the alley.

215
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:53,783
We've got your six, Ed!

216
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,688
Where are the shots
coming from?

217
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:02,691
Can't tell.

218
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:06,362
No muzzle flash.

219
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:08,597
No one's approaching!

220
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:09,765
Weird offensive strategy,

221
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,099
surrounding your targets
in smoke!

222
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,968
They won't be able to see us!

223
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:14,202
They haven't
targeted the windows,

224
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:16,471
they're just firin'
at the roof!

225
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:17,872
No intent to injure.

226
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,774
An elevated
sniper pinning us down.

227
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,348
Okay, guys, this is delay.
It is not an attack.

228
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,417
<i>Smoke works both ways.
We've got cover too.</i>

229
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:30,518
<i>Let's not give
'em any more time.</i>

230
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:32,286
Shields up.
Let's close in. Boss!

231
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:33,387
In position.

232
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:54,340
Right there! Don't move!
Freeze! Don't move!

233
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:55,474
Freeze!

234
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:58,544
Hold fire! Hold fire!

235
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,045
Come on! Move!

236
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:01,180
Keep going to
the end of the alley!

237
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:03,949
Boss, the guard's
coming your way!

238
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:16,027
Rear of the van is clear.

239
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:22,666
Okay, remaining
guards are okay!

240
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,605
Come on, you're all right.

241
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:29,673
You're all right.

242
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,007
What's going on?

243
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:32,543
There were three
of them at least.

244
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,079
They blew the safe.

245
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,780
Yeah, but where'd they go?

246
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:40,049
It's a clean job.
Looks like they used c4.

247
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,351
These guys knew
what they were doing.

248
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:42,485
What was in there?

249
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,786
This was our last stop.

250
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:44,721
<i>What we already had
in the drop safe,</i>

251
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:46,589
what we picked up here...

252
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:47,957
Little over two million.

253
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:48,791
We were supposed to take it
out of town,

254
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:49,992
up to the federal bank.

255
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,594
Doesn't the money usually flow
the other way?

256
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:53,094
It's all used bills.

257
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:54,396
The feds are rolling out
a new design for the twenty.

258
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:55,930
<i>Today was our last collection,</i>

259
00:12:55,998 --> 00:12:57,899
gettin' all the banks to give us
the rest of their old bills,

260
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:00,034
get them replaced with the new.

261
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:02,303
Until it's destroyed,
it's still legal tender.

262
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:03,805
<i>Guys, I know why
your truck shut down.</i>

263
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:05,106
Electrical arrestors.

264
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:06,375
They short-out
a car's electrical system

265
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,809
when you drive over them.

266
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:09,344
It's temporary though.

267
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:10,845
But effective.
It was a trap.

268
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:11,980
They lured us into the alley

269
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:13,982
and made sure
they had a way out.

270
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,384
Professional, prepared...

271
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,319
And they're long gone.

272
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:19,854
<i>Well, the day's not over yet.
Let's scour the alley.</i>

273
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:21,822
Let's get these guys before
they really hurt somebody.

274
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:26,226
The security camera's gone.

275
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:28,929
The e-a is definitely homemade.

276
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:30,730
We could source the parts
if we had a couple of days.

277
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:32,366
Gotta be faster than that.

278
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,534
<i>We gotta pick up the trail.
Sam, what do we got?</i>

279
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:36,270
There's a perfect alley
back here,

280
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:38,772
lots of concealment and access
all the way to king.

281
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,407
The smoke covered them.

282
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:41,073
They get out through
there with the money.

283
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:42,341
Sid...

284
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,277
Did you get a look
at these guys?

285
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:45,278
Just the cop.

286
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:46,845
A cop?

287
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:48,480
Yeah, he said we were
blocking the laneway.

288
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:49,648
He got me out of the truck
and he pulled a gun.

289
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:52,651
Well, whoever these guys
are, they got connections.

290
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,253
Along with everything
you find in c4,

291
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,488
I'm getting traces of motor oil
back here.

292
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:59,291
Yeah, the military bakes that
into their c4 as a marker.

293
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:01,993
In case it ever gets stolen,
they can always track it.

294
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:04,061
<i>Every base uses
a different signature.</i>

295
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:05,362
I'm gonna run it
through the database

296
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,630
and see what I can find.

297
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:07,932
<i>- I got a visual.
- Where?</i>

298
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,699
One of the cruisers
that responded on king.

299
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,768
Their in-car camera got lucky.

300
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:14,972
We're under fire in the alley

301
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,907
<i>and these "cops"
are going the other way.</i>

302
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:19,075
One cruiser, one cop,
three passengers,

303
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:20,709
and two big bags of money.

304
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,078
Any way we can clear
that image up, spike?

305
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:23,179
<i>Let me give it a try.</i>

306
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,948
Ed, I ran down the tracer
in the c4.

307
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:26,649
It's local.
It came from downsview.

308
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,684
Okay, let's find out how
the army lost enough c4

309
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:30,453
to blow up a safe
in an armoured truck.

310
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,055
We'll stay here,
figure out how to find a cop car

311
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,957
in a city full of cop cars.

312
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:35,090
Spike, get me that picture

313
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,124
as soon as you have it
cleaned up.

314
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,725
Let's find out if he served.

315
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,661
Eddie, I'm gonna try to smooth
the way for you at downsview.

316
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,267
Everybody okay?

317
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:46,301
Yeah.

318
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:47,269
We still on plan?

319
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,570
With a wrinkle.

320
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,638
We have to lay low for a bit,
get out of town.

321
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,106
<i>It was always our fallback.</i>

322
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,275
I just gotta make the call.

323
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:57,578
Sergeant,
there's no way that...

324
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:58,846
<i>I know what I'm saying.</i>

325
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:00,281
<i>Military ordinance
on the street,</i>

326
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:03,017
explosives from your base
used to rob an armoured truck.

327
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:04,385
<i>If we don't find it now...</i>

328
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:05,119
But what you're asking for...

329
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:06,820
may save lives.

330
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:08,121
<i>Gotta be a whole lot better
than a flock of reporters</i>

331
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:09,389
camped outside your gate

332
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,024
asking questions
you don't wanna answer.

333
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:13,092
<i>I understand.</i>

334
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,196
Your officers just pulled up.

335
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:17,563
I'll give you
whatever you need.

336
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:18,931
Thank you very much.

337
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,802
Captain Ruscitti, you
know why we're here?

338
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,037
Yeah, your
sergeant can be very persuasive.

339
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:26,405
He's right.

340
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:27,306
I'll do whatever you need
to find this stuff

341
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:28,740
and figure out who has it.

342
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,009
Okay, good. We're
gonna need log books;

343
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,676
we're gonna need
security cam footage

344
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:33,778
of the warehouse
where the c4 was kept,

345
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:35,981
and we're gonna need to talk
to the guy in charge.

346
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:38,150
I'm setting you up with
master corporal Ronnie birch.

347
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,484
He counts our boxes
and bullets.

348
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,519
If anyone can help you,
it'll be him.

349
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,154
What else you got?

350
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:43,954
Well, since
a bunch of army explosives

351
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,556
are out on the streets,

352
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:47,058
I've already given your team
access to something

353
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:48,993
that should help you
track these guys down.

354
00:15:58,102 --> 00:15:59,469
What do we got, spike?

355
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,704
A very strong
desire to join the army.

356
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,606
<i>I've got some programs
cleaning up the car-cam footage</i>

357
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:04,841
of our suspects.

358
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:06,076
That shouldn't be long,
but this...

359
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:07,644
<i>The M.P. At downsview</i>

360
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:11,280
patched me into the army's
military satellite system.

361
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,749
<i>It looks at police decals
and the light bar on top.</i>

362
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:16,618
Cross-referencing that
with the transponders

363
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:19,422
in all our cruisers
and we find...

364
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,925
The one cop car
without a transponder.

365
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:23,992
Our suspects.

366
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:30,198
You know, boss, if we had
this stuff all the time...

367
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,034
What happened?

368
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:34,602
I don't know. They
must've gone under cover,

369
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,571
like a parking garage
or a tunnel.

370
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,373
Satellites can't track
what they can't see.

371
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:40,075
Where, spike?

372
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,309
That's the address right there.
I'll send it to your PDA's.

373
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:43,143
Sam, Jules, let's go!

374
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,622
You all know what to do.

375
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,890
I'm gonna make sure we're set.

376
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,625
Trash all identifying evidence.

377
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:01,061
Hey, the cops got too close.

378
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,162
What do you think?

379
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,798
I think we have to move.

380
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,299
Whatever you got.

381
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:10,369
Forbes, we're gonna
have to lay low awhile,

382
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:11,838
<i>make sure our tracks
are covered,</i>

383
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,106
<i>wait for this to blow over.</i>

384
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:14,741
Guns? Not yet.

385
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,076
Won't it look bad
if we all just disappear?

386
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:19,444
Only if they're already on us.

387
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:21,880
It's just that limb
that we're out on, it's...

388
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:23,148
It's a little thin.
That's all I'm saying.

389
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,850
No, we're good, we just...

390
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,652
We're in this together.
We're all in this together.

391
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,853
This isn't just about
the four of us.

392
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,054
You know that, Doug.

393
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:30,255
<i>We'll be there at 1600.</i>

394
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:33,457
Right, four o'clock.

395
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,059
We all good?

396
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:38,262
Forbes, you're not still afraid
of the water, are you?

397
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,363
Let's go.

398
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:45,937
It's straightforward.

399
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,371
Every time ordinance goes out

400
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,872
it has to be signed
by the officer who ordered it

401
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,073
and me...

402
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:51,541
hard copy, and the computer.

403
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,243
<i>But once it leaves here
it's harder to track.</i>

404
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,444
And this is the
last couple of months?

405
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:55,812
Last two weeks.

406
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,748
Training exercises,
overseas deployments...

407
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:59,516
We send a lot
of this stuff out.

408
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,917
<i>Ed, trying to track
all these people down,</i>

409
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,953
it would take days.

410
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:04,453
All right, these
stretch back the last couple of months.

411
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:06,555
<i>Anything else you need,
we're on it.</i>

412
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:08,390
Okay.

413
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,558
<i>Ed, I just cleaned up
the image as much as I could</i>

414
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:11,493
and I just sent it out.

415
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,764
Okay, spike, thank you.

416
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:16,331
Sir, maybe you can help us
narrow this down.

417
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:17,733
You recognize this man?

418
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:19,301
He was involved in the robbery
this morning.

419
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,702
It can't be.
What're you saying?

420
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,871
That's sergeant Robert Gray;
He's one of our best.

421
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,139
He was here between
combat tours.

422
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:26,841
Honourable discharge
just last year.

423
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:28,442
Master corporal birch
can tell you all about him.

424
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,844
They were in basic together.

425
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:31,780
So you know this man?

426
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:34,949
And you sign for everything.

427
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,317
- Yes, sir.
- Where is he?

428
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:38,719
I don't know, sir.

429
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:40,054
Do you have an
address for Gray?

430
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,222
Yeah, it's a quick phone call
to personnel.

431
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,059
Boss, we got a positive I.D.
On a sergeant Robert Gray,

432
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:46,293
<i>former army.</i>

433
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,961
The address is coming your way.

434
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:50,463
Thanks, Eddie.
Hopefully we won't need it.

435
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,231
Spike found the car.

436
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,509
Spike, there's nothing here.

437
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,144
Satellites haven't picked up
any cruisers

438
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,645
leaving the area.

439
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,717
It's 'cause it doesn't
look like a police car anymore.

440
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,820
I got fake decals
and light bar.

441
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,755
Back to square one.

442
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:17,823
So now it's just a white car.

443
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:31,456
The city confirms the
house belongs to Robert Gray.

444
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:32,556
All right, let's
knock and announce,

445
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:34,692
give him a chance to surrender.

446
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,894
Who robs a bank
and then comes home?

447
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:41,898
Someone who thinks
they got away with it.

448
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:49,439
Robert Gray,
this is the police!

449
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,611
Strategic response unit,
open this door!

450
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:57,647
Robert Gray?

451
00:19:57,715 --> 00:19:58,814
He's not here.

452
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:00,149
Mind if we look around, sir?

453
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:01,951
Why?

454
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:02,852
We think he committed a
serious crime this morning.

455
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,553
No, no, no, no, no.

456
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,687
No way.

457
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,458
I can readjust the
parameters of the search,

458
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,593
get the satellites lookin'
for a white sedan.

459
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:12,827
Well, they couldn't
have gotten far.

460
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,062
Dialling it in.

461
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,666
Six million
people in the G.T.A.

462
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:19,434
And we gotta find
one white car.

463
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,201
Good news is white's
not the most popular colour.

464
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,303
What is?

465
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:23,638
Silver.

466
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:26,607
- But?
- White's number two.

467
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:31,345
Where's sergeant Gray?

468
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,946
You should just let him go.

469
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:36,116
He robbed an armoured
car with stolen explosives.

470
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,017
Did anyone get hurt?

471
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:39,986
There's a guard
in the hospital.

472
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:42,822
They fired on my men.
Yes, someone was hurt.

473
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,190
It wasn't supposed
to be like that.

474
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:45,424
So you knew what
they were up to?

475
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:47,359
It's all about being there
for the next guy.

476
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:50,296
<i>No one cares more for his men
than Gray.</i>

477
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:51,798
<i>When he left the army,</i>

478
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,032
<i>he came back
and his life was falling apart,</i>

479
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,667
but he pulled it together

480
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,770
because he knew there were
soldiers that needed his help.

481
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:00,738
So what, so that's what
the money was for?

482
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:02,707
It's not just about the money.

483
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:10,715
When was the last
time you saw Mr. Gray?

484
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:13,718
Never heard anyone
call him mister.

485
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,753
It's always been sarge.

486
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:18,956
This morning.

487
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:19,824
He and a couple of other guys
staying here

488
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,358
<i>left when we were out.</i>

489
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:22,626
<i>Boss, Gray's not comin' back.</i>

490
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:24,561
His closet's half-empty.

491
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,496
Any sense that
he was taking a trip?

492
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:29,366
He said he might
be gone for a while.

493
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:31,135
It depended on a meeting
he had this morning.

494
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:32,602
How well do you know him?

495
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,770
He saved my life.

496
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:34,904
On duty?

497
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:36,840
No.

498
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,942
When I got back.

499
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:42,779
Let me show you something.

500
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:49,552
<i>Did you find the car?</i>

501
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,387
Uh, not yet.
I was just checkin' in.

502
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:53,356
You need to talk to sarge?
Your radio broke?

503
00:21:53,423 --> 00:21:55,123
No, I mean with you.

504
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:57,259
No, no, no, no.

505
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:58,627
Sam, this is not
how this is gonna go.

506
00:21:58,695 --> 00:21:59,528
<i>Jules, I just...</i>

507
00:21:59,596 --> 00:22:00,963
I'm fine, Sam.

508
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,732
I just wanna know
how you're doing.

509
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,932
<i>I'm doing my job.</i>

510
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,433
<i>Sam, I got somethin'.</i>

511
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:07,435
Yeah, me too.

512
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:11,339
What have you got?

513
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:12,807
White sedans,
former police cars,

514
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,041
are rarer than I thought.

515
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:15,377
We got two,
three possible targets.

516
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:17,979
Can you tell
how many passengers?

517
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,314
Sadly, satellites
cannot see through steel yet.

518
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:21,749
Where's Gray now?

519
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:22,683
<i>I don't know.</i>

520
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:24,485
He didn't tell me the plan.

521
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,021
Plausible deniability he said.

522
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:28,555
<i>Ed, we need you
guys back downtown.</i>

523
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:30,758
Spike's found a few vehicles
that need tracking.

524
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:32,360
That one's closest to him.

525
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:33,460
Okay, Ed, there's a
possible suspect vehicle

526
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:34,461
heading in your direction

527
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:35,930
we need to get eyes on.

528
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:37,197
<i>Spike's sending you
the coordinates now.</i>

529
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:39,632
Copy that. Leah, let's move.

530
00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:44,337
Winnie, I got a job
for some UNI's.

531
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,374
We got a white sedan
heading east on Danforth.

532
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,309
We're gonna need eyes in.

533
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:50,410
<i>Send me the details.
I'll have them track it down.</i>

534
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:51,177
<i>Thank you, Winnie.</i>

535
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,178
And that one is ours.

536
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,679
Let's do it.

537
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:58,284
They live here?

538
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:02,354
Yeah. All former army,
all just like me - struggling,

539
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,823
trying to find a way
to fit back in.

540
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:06,292
<i>Injured or not, you live here,</i>

541
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,327
Gray expects you
to do your part.

542
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:09,427
Rebuilding his deck?

543
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:11,262
Taking pride,

544
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,263
<i>making a difference,</i>

545
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:13,965
helping each other.

546
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:19,304
You said he saved your life.

547
00:23:23,175 --> 00:23:25,475
Have you ever
served, sergeant?

548
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:28,912
No. Been in
uniform 25 years though.

549
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,381
You see a lot of stuff,

550
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,085
things nobody can understand,

551
00:23:35,153 --> 00:23:37,554
things you can never forget.

552
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:44,994
I was in Afghanistan.

553
00:23:46,864 --> 00:23:50,333
We were called in
after an I.E.D. Went off

554
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,868
in a market place.

555
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:53,670
My job...

556
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:56,372
My job was to find
all the arms and legs,

557
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,639
match them up,

558
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:03,479
so we could figure out
how many casualties there were.

559
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:06,849
<i>How do you tell that story
at a cocktail party?</i>

560
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:12,754
How do you stop
remembering that it happened?

561
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:17,224
And that's where Gray comes in?

562
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,392
<i>When you leave the army,</i>

563
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,760
lots of guys don't
have a problem

564
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:22,697
<i>and the army helps
with the reintegration.</i>

565
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:26,934
<i>But guys like me,
I'm on medication for the pain,</i>

566
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:29,803
<i>for, for, for my depression,
for my dreams,</i>

567
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,572
<i>for just about everything.</i>

568
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:39,646
I'd been home more than a year
living in my parent's basement,

569
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:41,748
<i>drinking too much.</i>

570
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:47,653
When I called sergeant Gray...

571
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,824
<i>Without a question,
he came, picked me up,</i>

572
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:54,760
<i>invited me to stay with him.</i>

573
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,980
I don't have a lot of rules.
This isn't your mother's house.

574
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:16,948
There's no curfew.

575
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,715
Which one is it?

576
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,018
The door will always be open.
You'll always be welcome.

577
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,186
Getting there,
that's up to you.

578
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,454
This is the address?

579
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,123
It's about five blocks away.

580
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,296
It flattens out at the top.

581
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:48,211
<i>This place wasn't
exactly accessible,</i>

582
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,646
but we'd work on it.

583
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:52,548
The bathroom, the doorways.

584
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,116
He'd provide all the materials,

585
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:56,118
expect me to get to work.

586
00:25:56,186 --> 00:25:57,286
It's tough love.

587
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:59,154
<i>He's a sergeant.</i>

588
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:00,522
They know how to push
your buttons.

589
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:03,459
<i>Guys saw what it was doing
for me,</i>

590
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:05,695
they wanted to come too.

591
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:08,529
And he was happy to have them?

592
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:10,498
He never turned anyone away.

593
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:12,968
<i>Hey, boss, camp's right.</i>

594
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:15,670
Gray's being flooded with emails
from all over.

595
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:17,371
Army, marines...

596
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,843
They have all heard of Gray
and they're asking for help.

597
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:27,648
He's taking them in,
but it's costing him.

598
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:30,484
I have a request
for a second mortgage,

599
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:31,518
overdraft...

600
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:33,087
He doesn't have enough money.

601
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:34,855
We should be two
blocks behind our target.

602
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:36,189
Left, right up there.

603
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:40,493
Spike, I just got a call
from the UNI's.

604
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,528
<i>They located your white sedan
on the Danforth.</i>

605
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:43,730
Are you looking for a woman
in her thirties

606
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:45,297
going to the gym?

607
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:46,565
I'm not the gym type.
Thanks, Winnie.

608
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:48,400
So we're sure
it's one of these two?

609
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:49,401
Yeah, unless they painted
it when they stripped it down.

610
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,638
We should be able to see it.

611
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:55,107
You think camp knows?

612
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:58,409
No. Gray wants to keep
his circle small.

613
00:26:58,477 --> 00:26:59,410
Protect his men.

614
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:00,545
Take the money

615
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:02,213
and keep putting it
into this place.

616
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,782
You know, they come from
all over the country.

617
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,684
He flies some of 'em in,
puts them up,

618
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:07,385
never even asks for a penny.

619
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:09,254
And there are more than 8 vets
who could use his help.

620
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:10,855
Maybe he's looking
for a bigger place.

621
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,089
That's what I was thinking.

622
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:13,090
I asked the bank
to look into it,

623
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:14,692
see if anything's underway.

624
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:17,461
Ed, how close are we?

625
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:18,629
Sam, there!

626
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:19,296
The white car
we're lookin' for.

627
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:20,765
Can't see inside.

628
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:22,033
<i>Just like our suspects,</i>

629
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,300
there's four occupants.

630
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:24,935
Subject's in sight.

631
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,670
<i>Ed, stand down on the search
for your white sedan.</i>

632
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:28,672
We are in pursuit,
heading South on cherry street.

633
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,140
We need backup asap!

634
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:34,277
Sarge.

635
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,314
What's the plan?

636
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:39,582
Sarge?

637
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:41,918
Highly motivated people here.

638
00:27:41,986 --> 00:27:44,753
They've already taken
a lot of chances today.

639
00:27:48,992 --> 00:27:50,759
We're almost there.
We just have to lose 'em.

640
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:52,227
No way that happens.
They're too close.

641
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,029
This still works.
I stay behind, I keep 'em busy.

642
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:55,664
Kondraski no, that doesn't work.
We're not leaving you behind.

643
00:27:55,732 --> 00:27:56,699
No way,
sarge, let me stay.

644
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:57,900
I keep 'em busy.

645
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,267
You three get across
the finish line.

646
00:28:01,236 --> 00:28:03,204
Sarge-
You heard me!

647
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:04,806
<i>Now, Forbes,
hand me my bag.</i>

648
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:06,273
<i>They're gaining on us!</i>

649
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:26,593
Sam, we got movement
in the front passenger seat.

650
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,461
What's he doin'?

651
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:32,064
Sergeant Robert
Gray, step out of the vehicle,

652
00:28:32,132 --> 00:28:34,867
hands where we can see them!

653
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:42,274
That's it!
Slow and steady!

654
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:53,918
Spike, grenade! Pull back!

655
00:28:56,722 --> 00:28:58,489
Sam, what's goin' on?

656
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:00,458
He's got a grenade.
No pin in it!

657
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:01,626
That's not all.

658
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:02,793
He's got c4 strapped
to his chest.

659
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:03,927
On our way.

660
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:09,599
Ed, Gray's blocking our way.

661
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,301
The others went South
of the bridge.

662
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:12,302
If he drops that grenade...

663
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,503
c4 goes off too.

664
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:15,005
Takes this whole bridge down
with it.

665
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:28,798
Sergeant Gray,
you need to stand down!

666
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:29,899
This is over!

667
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,002
I don't think so.

668
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,469
Spike, we're almost there.

669
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,038
I don't think
that's a good idea.

670
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,073
No, as soon as we get
there we're trapped too.

671
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:39,709
Leah, give me a target.
Where else could they be going?

672
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,410
Down cherry street,
there's nothing but the lake.

673
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:42,745
Okay, that makes no sense.

674
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:44,146
There's gotta be another way
out for them.

675
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:45,347
Commissioners takes
them back downtown,

676
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:47,049
but they have to know
we'll block it.

677
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:48,951
Why would they
box themselves in?

678
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:51,854
Especially if
Gray's stallin' us?

679
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:53,756
Ashbridge's marina.

680
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:55,524
That's it. They jump on a
boat, they cross the border,

681
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,225
they disappear.
That's it.

682
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:58,726
Or stash the money and
come back to get it later.

683
00:29:58,794 --> 00:30:00,394
Okay, give me the
quickest route to the marina.

684
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:04,165
Sam, this is a man who's
used to being in control,

685
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:05,332
<i>setting the pace.</i>

686
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,668
I know this guy, sarge.

687
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:07,869
I know where he's comin' from.

688
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,037
<i>That's good.</i>

689
00:30:09,104 --> 00:30:10,337
Build on that,
but don't force it,

690
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:13,274
and let's get this guy
off that bridge.

691
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:15,909
<i>I'm movin' in, spike.</i>

692
00:30:19,714 --> 00:30:21,181
Sergeant Gray,
my name's Sam braddock.

693
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:23,050
I was hoping you could tell me
what's going on today.

694
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:24,685
Call it a humanitarian mission.

695
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:26,753
Firing on police,
stealing money from banks?

696
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,155
<i>You were never at risk.</i>

697
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:30,123
The money was gonna
be destroyed.

698
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:31,590
<i>The banks were insured.</i>

699
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:33,192
The only real victims here
are the men and women

700
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,795
<i>I'm tryin' to take care of.</i>

701
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,262
Spike, is there any
way to take this guy down?

702
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,597
Can't get close enough.

703
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:40,432
<i>Taser, shields -
whatever we use...</i>

704
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,968
he'll see us coming,
drop the grenade and...

705
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:54,278
That's the car!

706
00:30:54,346 --> 00:30:56,981
We're closing in! Let's go!

707
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:00,484
This is it.

708
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:02,320
Where's the guy
who's supposed to meet us?

709
00:31:02,387 --> 00:31:04,588
Sarge said sixteen hundred.
He's on his way with the keys.

710
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,227
Today, my teammates
spoke to a lot of people

711
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:12,329
who think you're a great man.

712
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,564
They're wrong.
I'm just doing my job.

713
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:16,800
That's what sergeants
always say.

714
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:18,968
Folks, clear out of the way.

715
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:20,369
Leah, right there.

716
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:22,905
Go around, get behind them.

717
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:24,573
Ma'am, clear out of the way,
please.

718
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:26,375
You serve? Yes, sir.</i>

719
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:28,477
I never met a sergeant
who didn't impress me.

720
00:31:28,545 --> 00:31:30,346
Today, you gotta lead
by example.

721
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:32,448
<i>Don't put your team at risk.</i>

722
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,616
Let's end this.

723
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,916
It should have been me.

724
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:36,184
What?

725
00:31:36,252 --> 00:31:37,485
Look, I'm the expendable one.

726
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,087
Give me a chance to prove myself
on that bridge

727
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,655
doing something.

728
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:43,859
You heard sarge.
Let's just get this done.

729
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:47,963
<i>Leah?</i>

730
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:50,365
Almost there.

731
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:52,733
Go now.

732
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,470
S.R.U.! Police!

733
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:57,772
S.R.U., don't move!
Don't move!

734
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:58,538
<i>Hands where I can see them!</i>

735
00:31:58,606 --> 00:31:59,974
Don't!

736
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,910
Don't make me.
Just let us go!

737
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:04,178
Can't do that.

738
00:32:04,246 --> 00:32:05,880
Forbes.

739
00:32:05,947 --> 00:32:07,480
<i>Look, I don't like
what you did today,</i>

740
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:08,915
but I understand it.

741
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:10,383
<i>We do our duty,
we serve and protect,</i>

742
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,951
and we're there for each other.
I get that.

743
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:15,021
Yeah, when no one else will.

744
00:32:17,391 --> 00:32:20,760
Come on, buddy,
step away from the bag.

745
00:32:20,828 --> 00:32:22,162
Just step away.

746
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:26,131
Doug, don't!
It's over.

747
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,707
Thank you.
Leah.

748
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:41,546
Subjects contained.

749
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:42,847
I've just been told

750
00:32:42,915 --> 00:32:45,317
we've captured
the rest of your team.

751
00:32:47,152 --> 00:32:48,853
You're lying.

752
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:49,621
<i>No, sir. All three
of them at the marina</i>

753
00:32:49,689 --> 00:32:50,988
and they're unharmed.

754
00:32:56,227 --> 00:32:58,462
All I wanted to do
was give 'em a chance.

755
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,730
<i>I understand,</i>

756
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:02,800
<i>but there's gotta be
another way.</i>

757
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:06,837
You're right, there is.

758
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:17,913
Sam, what's goin' on?

759
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,950
How's sergeant Gray?

760
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:22,418
We're workin' on it.

761
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,620
I really let him
down, you know that?

762
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:25,822
You did the right thing.

763
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:27,689
No, he needed to make this work.

764
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,725
It was the last chance we had.

765
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,760
What are you sayin'?

766
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:36,097
Sergeant Gray,
that's not a good idea!

767
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:37,932
Sam, body language.

768
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,301
He's not surrendering,
potential suicide.

769
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,471
Okay, let's just keep talking,

770
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:43,904
<i>all right?</i>

771
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:47,875
Those men and women,
they're gonna need you.

772
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,276
Don't come any closer.

773
00:33:50,846 --> 00:33:53,013
Boss, I just got off the phone
with Gray's bank.

774
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:55,683
The death benefit, the pension,
it all goes to camp if he dies.

775
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:56,984
It doesn't matter
the cause of death,

776
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:57,918
it still pays out.

777
00:33:57,986 --> 00:33:59,253
How much?

778
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,620
About a half a million dollars.

779
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:01,921
Sam, knife's edge here.

780
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:03,322
This isn't who you are!

781
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:05,157
This isn't how you want people
to remember you.

782
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:06,593
Yes it is!

783
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,961
<i>- This is exactly</i>-

784
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:11,398
Doing what needs to be done.

785
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:14,434
Look at me, sergeant Gray!

786
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:16,234
<i>Sammy, get back.
Too close!</i>

787
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:17,736
Sergeant Gray, listen to me.

788
00:34:17,804 --> 00:34:19,037
You tried to do
a good thing today.

789
00:34:19,105 --> 00:34:20,439
You've been trying to help
for months.

790
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:21,774
<i>He's within twenty feet.</i>

791
00:34:21,841 --> 00:34:23,876
Even with body armour,
he's way too close.

792
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,076
Sam...

793
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:33,293
You need to stay back.

794
00:34:35,797 --> 00:34:37,197
Even with the money,
I don't get it.

795
00:34:37,265 --> 00:34:38,432
<i>His pride, his honour...</i>

796
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,199
He's not the type of guy
to kill himself.

797
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,935
I know. We're missin' something.
Eddie?

798
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:43,269
I hear you, boss.

799
00:34:43,337 --> 00:34:44,104
Look, you wanted to help
sergeant Gray,

800
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:45,105
now's the time to do it.

801
00:34:45,172 --> 00:34:46,606
What do you mean?

802
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:47,907
He's not giving up.
His life is in danger.

803
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:49,676
<i>Seconds count.
We gotta move fast.</i>

804
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:50,677
Okay, what can I do?

805
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:51,945
Give us a way in.

806
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:53,046
Now I heard Gray's life
was falling apart

807
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:54,047
when he left the army.

808
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:55,081
<i>What happened?</i>

809
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:56,081
It was his wife.

810
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:57,382
She left him?

811
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,951
She was pregnant
with their first kid.

812
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:00,919
<i>He was so happy.
It was great to see him smile.</i>

813
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:01,920
<i>We were supposed
to get a leave,</i>

814
00:35:01,988 --> 00:35:03,055
<i>but then we got extended.</i>

815
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:04,289
It was an accident.

816
00:35:04,357 --> 00:35:06,058
She fell.
She hit her head.

817
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:07,359
<i>Nobody thought anything
was wrong,</i>

818
00:35:07,426 --> 00:35:08,994
<i>but then the next day
they found her.</i>

819
00:35:09,062 --> 00:35:10,362
<i>She died in her sleep,</i>

820
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:11,929
<i>some sort of rupture
in her brain.</i>

821
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:13,364
The baby died too.

822
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:14,766
<i>He felt that if he'd...</i>

823
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,567
if he'd have been there,
he could've found her,

824
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:18,770
saved her life.

825
00:35:18,837 --> 00:35:20,504
- Sam, you get that?
- Yeah.

826
00:35:20,572 --> 00:35:21,939
He feels like he
can't fail at his mission.

827
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:23,207
<i>Without it...</i>

828
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:24,008
He'd have to think
about his past,

829
00:35:24,076 --> 00:35:26,177
all the people he's lost.

830
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:27,878
Sergeant Gray,
you say you've been doing this

831
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:29,512
<i>for all the men and women
who need help,</i>

832
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,581
<i>but it's not just about them.</i>

833
00:35:31,649 --> 00:35:33,316
It's about you, too.

834
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:38,288
When I was a kid,
my little sister was killed

835
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:40,023
in an accident.

836
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:42,893
I was there, I saw it happen.

837
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,994
Ripped a hole
in the middle of my life,

838
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,762
but it's not like I could
talk about it at home.

839
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,365
<i>My dad's a general,
my mom's a good army wife.</i>

840
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:51,801
The orders from the top
of my family

841
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:54,636
were to deal with it
and move on.

842
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:59,108
<i>So my dad dove into his work -
longer tours, longer hours.</i>

843
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:00,441
My mom did
the civilian version...

844
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:01,843
P.T.A., volunteering.

845
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:04,612
And I thought...

846
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,081
"How can they get over it
so fast?

847
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:09,350
How can they not even
talk about her?"

848
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:12,821
<i>'Cause it hurt too much.</i>

849
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:13,822
They were just trying
to do anything

850
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:15,223
but spend time in the house,

851
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,625
anything but be reminded
of what happened.

852
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,030
<i>It's a noble cause
you're fighting for, sergeant,</i>

853
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,431
<i>but it also keeps you</i>

854
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:26,100
from thinking about
the people you've lost,

855
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,236
<i>the people
you couldn't protect.</i>

856
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:34,140
All I can picture is...

857
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:36,876
My wife, Kathryn,

858
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,846
alone...

859
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:41,647
Lying there,
no one to help her.

860
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:53,892
Without this...

861
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,093
What do I do?

862
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:03,201
You forgive yourself
and you remember her...

863
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,504
not for the soldiers,
not for them,

864
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:07,639
for you.

865
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:32,829

Your mother is single-handedly

880
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,636
keeping the post office
in business.

881
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:51,738
This time she waits
till the third line

882
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:52,972
to ask before
I'm coming to visit.

883
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,106
Aw.

884
00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:57,276
You wanna be my wing man,

885
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:59,611
keep all my aunts from wondering
why I'm still single?

886
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,879
What's in it for me?

887
00:39:00,946 --> 00:39:04,082
All the homemade wine
you can drink.

888
00:39:04,149 --> 00:39:05,550
I'm listening.

889
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:07,519
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

890
00:39:10,523 --> 00:39:11,423
Jules.

891
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:12,290
Hey, boss...

892
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:13,291
Yeah?

893
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,859
You're a father.

894
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:15,993
I am.

895
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,028
Do you find it hard
being a cop?

896
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:20,330
You mean not knowing when
you'll come home at night,

897
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,632
if you'll come home at all;

898
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,133
trying to stay involved
in your kid's life;

899
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,334
trying to protect 'em;

900
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,636
not being able to arrest
the kids

901
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:27,170
that are mean to 'em?

902
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:29,339
It's a piece of cake.

903
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:32,975
You and Sam thinking about it?

904
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:34,143
It's come up.

905
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:36,078
You'll make a good mom, Jules.

906
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:37,781
Do you think
I'll still make a good cop?

907
00:39:37,848 --> 00:39:41,183
Do you need me to answer that?

908
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:43,185
Uncle spike, Uncle Ed,

909
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:44,754
we'll have that kid's back.

910
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:49,825
Yeah, you too.
Okay, dinner it is.

911
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:51,860
I'll give you the rest
of the details then.

912
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:53,562
Thanks.

913
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:55,564
That was my dad.

914
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:56,732
The army knows guys like that

915
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,434
are still slippin'
through the cracks.

916
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:00,235
Any way he can help 'em out?

917
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:01,437
Well, he's gotta wait and see,

918
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:03,071
but he thinks maybe
they can buy the house,

919
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:04,239
leave it in Gray's name.

920
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:05,773
It's a small price to pay.

921
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:06,975
That's what he thinks.

922
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:08,776
Nice work, Sam.

923
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:12,147
Hey.

924
00:40:12,214 --> 00:40:13,214
<i>Hey.</i>

925
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:15,883
What's wrong?

926
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:22,622
You were right,
it does change things.

927
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,858
I could've lost you today.

928
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:27,428
Jules, you could
lose me any day.

929
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,496
I know. I get that part.

930
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:36,669
Though the two of us
could've lost you today.

931
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:37,603
How do you think
I would have feel

932
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:39,738
if that was you out there?

933
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:42,942
I can't tell you
not to do your job.

934
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,544
And I can't tell you either.

935
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,014
We gotta tell the team.

936
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:49,882
Tomorrow.

937
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,918
♪ It's not so hard
to realize the truth... ♪

938
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:56,288
Go to the store
and get bubble wrap?

939
00:40:56,356 --> 00:40:57,856
Yeah? And some tea?

940
00:40:57,923 --> 00:40:59,057
Herbal?

941
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,058
I could use a cup.

942
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:01,193
Okay.

943
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:05,685
