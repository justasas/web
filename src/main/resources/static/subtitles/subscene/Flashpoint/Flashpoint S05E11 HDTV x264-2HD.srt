1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:08,381
<i>Oh my God!
No!</i>

2
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:09,549
<i>Nooooo!</i>

3
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:14,286
<i>Oh my God, my baby!</i>
<i>My baby!</i>

4
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:22,294
Ed!

5
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:29,501
<i>Oh my God!
Oh my God!</i>

6
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:35,674
<i>What happened up there, Ed?</i>

7
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:38,243
<i>Eddie!</i>
<i>What happened up there?</i>

8
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:49,052
Just about.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,422
You want me to pick up anything
on the way home?

10
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,357
Sure.
Red or white?

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,194
Something "full-bodied
and juicy."

12
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,397
Honey, I still have my Freud
textbooks from med school,

13
00:01:00,464 --> 00:01:02,465
don't make me use 'em.

14
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:04,467
Right now?

15
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:07,270
<i>Shooting took place
on the Center Island Ferry</i>

16
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:08,905
<i>just over an hour ago.</i>

17
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,407
<i>SRU were on scene</i>

18
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:12,808
<i>and the Special</i>
<i>Investigations Unit confirms</i>

19
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:15,377
<i>there has been</i>
<i>a civilian fatality.</i>

20
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:17,279
I don't know.

21
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:20,181
Well, no, I couldn't tell you
even if he was.

22
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:21,450
That-that's not gonna work.

23
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:22,818
You make a great dinner
every night.

24
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:25,120
You can't bribe me that way.

25
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:26,288
I will.

26
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,089
I love you too.

27
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,760
Ed! Hey!

28
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,695
Did we... I didn't forget
a session, did I?

29
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,330
No, no. I just wanted
to drop off the books

30
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:38,065
and the journal and stuff
you lent me.

31
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,634
Are you done with them?

32
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,068
Actually, I'm done
with the sessions

33
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:42,202
and the therapy.

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,637
I just wanted to let you know.

35
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,639
Okay. Can you come in
for a sec?

36
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,340
Yeah. Can you shut the door?

37
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:48,875
Sure.

38
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:49,943
Look, I know you're busy, so...

39
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,645
No, it's fine.

40
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,279
<i>I just need to go through</i>
<i>a few things</i>

41
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,081
to wrap up our work.

42
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,017
- Do you have a sec?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,753
Okay, and you started coming
here, when was that?

44
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,021
Two months - two months,
one week, five days.

45
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,792
That's right.

46
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,829
You wanted to talk about some
specific issues around a case,

47
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,363
"May Dalton."

48
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,965
Shame, we never got around
to talking about that.

49
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,333
Oh, that's okay.

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,033
Look, you have been great.

51
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:17,635
You've given me a lot of stuff
to think about,

52
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:18,970
and I just wanted
to say thanks.

53
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,605
I appreciate that.

54
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,873
I'm wondering, though,

55
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,274
why you feel like
you're done with therapy?

56
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:25,042
Uh...

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,713
No offense,
it's just not for me.

58
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,814
So I'm not that great, huh?

59
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:30,815
I didn't say that.

60
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,749
You kinda just did.

61
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,085
But - can I ask,

62
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:36,353
we didn't have a session booked
till next week...

63
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,988
Why didn't you just drop
the stuff off then?

64
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:40,056
No, I just, I... I hate
when people borrow stuff

65
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:41,725
and don't return 'em, so...

66
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:43,760
This wouldn't have anything
to do with today, would it?

67
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:46,363
Center Island Ferry?

68
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,563
I can't talk about that.

69
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,764
You can talk about
anything here, Ed...

70
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,633
You know that -
if you want to.

71
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,067
Whatever happened today,

72
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,135
it's got nothing to do
with that,

73
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,370
it's not why I'm done.

74
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,706
Okay.

75
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:59,375
Look, you've already paid
for this week's session.

76
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:00,576
And I like you, Ed,

77
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:03,445
but I'm still gonna
charge you for it.

78
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:04,913
You're here anyway,

79
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:07,481
<i>why don't you just tell me</i>
<i>about your day.</i>

80
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:11,152
You sure there's, uh,
no place you have to be?

81
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,454
I'm right where I need to be.

82
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:16,090
Okay.

83
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,159
The day started normal.

84
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:20,293
Up early, out early.
Just the way I like it.

85
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,466
Don't you look nice...

86
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:28,536
<i>How's the family?
Sophie, Isabelle...</i>

87
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:29,637
<i>Good.</i>

88
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:32,272
<i>How about Clark?</i>

89
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,407
Cutie...

90
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,710
Just you had mentioned

91
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:38,912
you guys were having
some issues communicating.

92
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,047
No, he's good. We're all good.
We're all good.

93
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:42,649
- Work was-
- "Good?"

94
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:44,784
It was.

95
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:48,354
All right!

96
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:50,456
All right, now, I love today.

97
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:52,490
Do you know why I love today?

98
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:53,859
Whatever it is,

99
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:55,193
I'm guessing it means
why we won't love today.

100
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:56,628
That's right!
Today is drill day...

101
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:58,997
Races, weights,
punishing physical activity.

102
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:00,566
What's not to love?

103
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,233
Wow.

104
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:03,702
And they haven't found a way
to accidentally shoot you yet?

105
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,005
Well, there's a reason why
we're the best team in the city.

106
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,073
Trust me, they love it.

107
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,676
Anyway, it didn't matter.

108
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:12,843
Hot call, Team One.

109
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,545
<i>911 call, firearms involved.</i>

110
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,547
Saved by the Winnie!

111
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:19,183
Multiple callers
report single white male...

112
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,818
White male, 30's,
downtown area,

113
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,519
had a duffel bag and firearm.

114
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:24,754
You hear yourself, right?

115
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:26,122
<i>You talk to me like</i>
<i>I'm your sergeant,</i>

116
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,058
or the Special
Investigations Unit.

117
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,192
I don't need
an official report.

118
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,894
Just try telling me like uh...

119
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:32,261
I'm a friend, or another cop.

120
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:33,529
But you're not a cop.

121
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:34,798
I mean, I'm sorry,
but you're not.

122
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:35,999
No. I'm not.

123
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,300
But I know a bit about the job.

124
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,935
Really.

125
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:40,168
Well, how?

126
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:43,706
Just try... telling me
the story

127
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:46,141
however it feels best.

128
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:50,579
We were unsure
where the subject was

129
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:51,981
in the downtown area.

130
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:57,151
Spike, traffic cams?

131
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:58,452
<i>Sending you
what we've got so far.</i>

132
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,988
Looks like he's heading south
on Bathurst,

133
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,789
<i>past Lakeshore.</i>

134
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:04,859
Looks bigger than
a sidearm to me.

135
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:06,094
Could be a sawed-off
shotgun.

136
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:07,629
He's carrying it out in public?

137
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:08,763
<i>And whatever's in that bag.</i>

138
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:09,998
Guys, what do we got
down there...

139
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:10,999
<i>Parks, construction yards,</i>
<i>what?</i>

140
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,298
Harbourfront.

141
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,734
<i>Okay, team, Harbourfront.</i>

142
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,602
No lights, no sirens;
Let's not spook our subject.

143
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,772
<i>Spike, look for him on</i>
<i>Harbourfront CCTV footage.</i>

144
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,340
Guy's carrying a
weapon in plain view.

145
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,942
We might be looking
at heightened emotion,

146
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,678
and desire to provoke
confrontation.

147
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:26,412
Guys...

148
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,148
<i>He's getting on</i>
<i>the Center Island Ferry.</i>

149
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,783
<i>His weapon's concealed.</i>

150
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,584
We can't let that boat
get out on open water.

151
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:33,953
No, the footage is
from four minutes ago.

152
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,320
The boat's already left.

153
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:36,321
He starts shooting,
it's fish in a barrel.

154
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:37,523
We'll have no way to stop him.

155
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,891
<i>We get a marine cruiser,</i>

156
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,726
we can board from the port side
emergency ladder.

157
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:41,994
Then you lose the
element of surprise.

158
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:43,428
We could call the boat back
to the terminal,

159
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:44,929
and rush it when it docks?

160
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:46,064
There's too many
people, it's uncontrolled.

161
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:47,231
We don't know
what's in that bag;

162
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,499
if he's got a bomb,
weapons, what.

163
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:49,968
Isn't there another
old marine terminal,

164
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:51,369
down below Lakeshore?

165
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:52,971
They still got a dock,
totally abandoned.

166
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,739
We'd have complete control.
Good thinking, Leah.

167
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,141
All right, Eddie,
you get eyes in on the boat,

168
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,210
I'll co-ordinate
with the port authority.

169
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:00,944
<i>We'll announce
an emergency evacuation.</i>

170
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,946
<i>No, no. Don't make
it sound like an emergency.</i>

171
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,314
Just have the captain announce

172
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:05,983
that they have to make
a last minute stop

173
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,484
<i>and they'll be</i>
<i>on their way soon.</i>

174
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:10,854
<i>That must be hard...</i>

175
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:12,355
Rushing to a scene,

176
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:14,124
<i>not knowing</i>
<i>what you're about to face.</i>

177
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:16,759
I'd find that hard.
Scary, even.

178
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:19,727
Well, you hope for the best,
plan for the worst.

179
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,200
<i>We are  docking
temporarily to address a minor repair.</i>

180
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,467
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

181
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,269
Good visual on the ferry.

182
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,871
<i>No joy on the subject.</i>

183
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,406
<i>Eddie, we're holding
off on the gangplank...</i>

184
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,707
No one on or off

185
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,408
until we know what
we're dealing with.

186
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,043
<i>We are docking temporarily</i>

187
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:36,745
<i>to address a minor repair.</i>
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

188
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,213
He must be inside.

189
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,583
<i>Okay, hold on. We got
a middle-aged man here,</i>

190
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,152
<i>he's carrying a duffel bag.</i>

191
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,787
<i>Check his right arm
- he's hiding something.</i>

192
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:50,725
He's talking.

193
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:51,550
To who?

194
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,160
I don't know. He's got no phone.
He's alone.

195
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:54,188
He's got no headset.

196
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,563
<i>He's acting erratic.
He's reaching for the bag!</i>

197
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:59,131
<i>What's he got in there, Eddie?</i>

198
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,704
It's a baby.

201
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:43,891
A baby, say again?

202
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,196
<i>Affirmative. Subject
has a baby in his bag.</i>

203
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:55,835
What's he doing?

204
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,108
Okay, we lost him.
He's gone inside, boss.

205
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,743
I'm coming down
for an action plan.

206
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,345
<i>Officer Braddock remained</i>
<i>in position</i>

207
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:06,746
<i>to cover the boat</i>

208
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:07,614
<i>while the rest of the team</i>
<i>and myself</i>

209
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:08,948
<i>formed an action plan.</i>

210
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:10,517
<i>Save the infant,</i>

211
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,284
<i>evacuate the passengers,</i>

212
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:14,053
<i>remove the subject as a threat.</i>

213
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,287
What was that like?

214
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:17,156
"Like?"

215
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:18,391
That's my job.

216
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,692
We get two or three EDP calls
a week...

217
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,561
That's "Emotionally
Disturbed Person."

218
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:24,363
I know what an EDP is;
That's my job.

219
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:26,198
<i>I'm just wondering</i>
<i>what it's like to be there,</i>

220
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,432
knowing that a life's
in danger.

221
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,335
Knowing that...
it's up to you.

222
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,370
You mean
"how did it feel?"

223
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:33,639
Would I ask something
like that?

224
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:34,907
You just did.

225
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,543
That's true.

226
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,613
It felt good.

227
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,349
<i>Because I knew that we were</i>
<i>the best chance that baby</i>

228
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:48,253
and those people had
of getting out alive.

229
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,455
Because of my team.

230
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:52,924
<i>They're fast, they are smart,</i>
<i>and they're brave.</i>

231
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,126
<i>They'd give their lives</i>
<i>for each other,</i>

232
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:57,866
<i>the public, for me.</i>

233
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:01,098
<i>And your sergeant?</i>

234
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,134
<i>And Greg he's a... he's
at a whole other level.</i>

235
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:05,802
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>nobody knows people better...</i>

236
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,637
<i>How they think,</i>
<i>what they'll do.</i>

237
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:08,972
He wrote the book, huh?

238
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:12,342
He is the book.

239
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,277
<i>Boss, I got
an Amber alert here,</i>

240
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,678
<i>came out about an hour ago.</i>

241
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,946
"Katherine Thompson,"
5-month-old infant.

242
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:18,314
Okay, Winnie,
let's put a call out to the...

243
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:19,748
The mother?
I'm patching her through.

244
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:21,551
<i>Nice work, Winnie.</i>

245
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:22,952
Mrs. Thompson?

246
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,787
I've got sergeant Greg Parker
on the line.

247
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:26,922
Oh my God, where's my baby!
Do you have my baby?!

248
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,691
<i>Mrs. Thompson,
my name is Greg.</i>

249
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:30,393
Now, I can't imagine
what you're feeling right now,

250
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:33,027
but I need you to help me
with something, please.

251
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:36,064
<i>Now, you get why
he did that, right?</i>

252
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:38,500
Terrified woman,
out of control.

253
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,667
Instead of asking
about the baby...

254
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:41,035
The source of her fear...

255
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,804
He asks for a favour,

256
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,540
giving her some control back.

257
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,208
Did I pass?

258
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:48,642
Hmm...

259
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,910
We needed to figure out
a connection

260
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:52,079
between the subject
and the baby.

261
00:09:52,147 --> 00:09:54,582
She's with a man, in
his thirties, brown hair...

262
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,016
<i>It was just her and me all day.</i>

263
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,551
She doesn't sleep so well,

264
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,253
so anytime she dozes,
I put her in her room, alone.

265
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:00,887
I opened the window.

266
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:02,289
<i>I just did it for the air.</i>

267
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:04,056
<i>Best thing for a little one.</i>

268
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,993
But who would have access
to that window?

269
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,362
I'm on the fifth floor,
it leads into a fire escape.

270
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,930
Someone could have come up,
it could...

271
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:12,165
I don't know, I don't know...

272
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,000
It could be anyone,
I don't know!

273
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,169
Ask if she knows anybody
who plays piano.

274
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:18,204
Anybody you know play piano,
Maria?

275
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:21,573
Harold.

276
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,208
Harold.
Who's that?

277
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:25,611
<i>My neighbour.
Harold Beamer, I think.</i>

278
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,446
He plays piano all day
and night.

279
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:28,880
<i>Sometimes he wakes up Katie,</i>

280
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:30,482
<i>but he always stops</i>
<i>when I ask him to.</i>

281
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,716
He's nice, he's nice...

282
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,985
Even if he's a bit...
well, crazy.

283
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,719
Can you even say "crazy"
these days?

284
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:37,821
Sam, meet us down below.
We'll cover onboard.

285
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,056
<i>Copy that. On my way.</i>

286
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:42,593
Right this way,
thank you very much.

287
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:44,028
- Right this way.
- Right over her, folks.

288
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,129
Right this way, please.
Thank you.

289
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:47,365
Sorry, folks.
Port Authority.

290
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:50,401
We have to vacate this boat.
Technical issues.

291
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:51,635
Sorry about that.

292
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:53,203
Right this way.

293
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,339
Eyes on subject -
seated bow, port side.

294
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,607
<i>He lives alone.</i>

295
00:10:57,675 --> 00:10:59,476
H-he barely comes out.

296
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:02,078
<i>Today, there was a couple guys</i>
<i>in moving uniforms.</i>

297
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:04,281
They were banging on his door.

298
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:06,616
<i>There was a woman with them.</i>
<i>She was crying.</i>

299
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:08,417
<i>I asked them to keep it down,</i>
<i>for Katie,</i>

300
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:11,920
<i>but he never came out,</i>
<i>so they left.</i>

301
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,890
He could have gone out
of his apartment,

302
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,925
and up the fire escape.

303
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:19,528
Is it him? Oh
my-why would he do this?!

304
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,063
<i>Mrs. Thompson, I'm
gonna have a police officer</i>

305
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,431
come and get you,

306
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,265
bring you down here, all right?

307
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,700
<i>You hang tight.</i>

308
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,202
Winnie, "Harold Beamer"...

309
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,436
Psych hospitals,
criminal record,

310
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,305
anything you got.

311
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:32,607
Eddie, what was with
the piano thing?

312
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,008
It was just a hunch.

313
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:35,042
It looked like he was
playing scales

314
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,344
on the gun barrel.

315
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,680
"Scales?" Really?
How'd you know that?

316
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,316
Oh! Clark plays,
doesn't he?

317
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:44,751
Turns out the hunch was good.

318
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,553
Harold Beamer,
admitted to the psych ward

319
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,955
at St. Patrick's Hospital,
2002.

320
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:50,290
Right this way, folks!

321
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,226
There'll be another boat soon.

322
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:54,027
<i>He's a former pianist
with the Toronto Philharmonic.</i>

323
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,596
<i>Diagnosed bipolar/</i>
<i>schizoaffective disorder.</i>

324
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:58,631
<i>He's prone to delusions</i>
<i>and mania.</i>

325
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:06,138
<i>Come on, hon, the
man's being very patient.</i>

326
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,541
It's fine, it's fine.
Right this way, come on.

327
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,409
- Oh look!
- Ma'am...

328
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:12,544
No! No! You need
to be quiet, okay?!

329
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:14,946
Subject is armed.

330
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:17,249
'Kay, sir,
sir, look at me.

331
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,551
You don't need to use
that gun, okay?

332
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:24,756
Oh, look what you've done!
Oh no, oh...

333
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,824
Sam, port side. Jules,
take the door, stay low.

334
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:28,225
What if he
comes out blasting?

335
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:30,060
Whoever has the
shot takes the shot.

336
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:31,828
<i>Our options were
extremely limited.</i>

337
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:32,829
I made sure each of us
was ready

338
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:33,830
to neutralize the subject...

339
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:35,766
To "neutralize"?

340
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:38,101
To kill.

341
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:39,770
Okay. Go on.

342
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:41,772
Say it.

343
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:43,521
Sorry?

344
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:45,040
"How could you kill
a sick and desperate man?"

345
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:46,342
That's what you're thinking.

346
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,310
Actually, I wasn't.
I was thinking about you,

347
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:49,245
I wasn't thinking about
your EDP.

348
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:50,280
"Harold Beamer."

349
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:51,414
We knew his name by then.

350
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:52,649
That's interesting.

351
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:54,350
What?

352
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:55,050
<i>Well, when you
started, he was "the EDP"</i>

353
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:56,085
or "the subject."

354
00:12:56,153 --> 00:12:57,754
Now, he's...
Harold Beamer.

355
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,821
That's the job. "Connect,
respect, protect."

356
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:01,690
That includes EDP's
like Harold Beamer.

357
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:02,824
We wanna get through to them

358
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:04,192
so we don't have
to neutralize them.

359
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,827
There's that word again.

360
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:07,462
It's not my word.

361
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,830
It's official
police terminology.

362
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:10,499
It makes people feel better...

363
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,301
The brass, media, everybody.

364
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,802
Trust me, you shoot a girl
in a public place...

365
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,170
"A girl?"

366
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:17,705
What?

367
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,940
You said "girl."

368
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:24,211
A girl, a guy, "subject."
Harold Beamer.

369
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,180
People want you to use
the magic words

370
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,115
to protect them...

371
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,951
<i>There's no brass here, Ed.
No media. Just me.</i>

372
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,385
And I may not be a cop,

373
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:33,486
but my dad was a 20-year vet
on the force,

374
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:36,255
so you don't need
to protect me.

375
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,393
Okay.

376
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:48,467
The situation was a mess,

377
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:51,804
and it was about
to get a lot worse.

378
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,639
Harold
oh... oh no.

379
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,142
Please, okay, no noise.

380
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,244
Please just keep it down.

381
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:01,679
Please just keep it down.

382
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:03,848
Come on, let's go. Quick!

383
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:07,885
Oh, she's upset.
It's okay, Suzy.

384
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:09,520
Baby's name is Katie.

385
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:11,355
<i>I don't know who Suzy is.</i>

386
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,590
Next of kin is listed
as Jordana Hauser,

387
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:16,025
<i>she's been notified.</i>

388
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,294
Shhhh... she's very sensitive,
she's sensitive.

389
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:19,563
She doesn't...
She doesn't like the noise,

390
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,598
and she...
she needs to hear the music.

391
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,333
<i>I just need to...</i>

392
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:24,868
I need...
I need to turn it around.

393
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:26,535
<i>I need to turn it around!</i>

394
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:28,036
I need to turn it around!

395
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:29,705
Spike, just keep him
focused on you.

396
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:32,307
Okay, talk to me,
how do we turn it around?

397
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:33,743
You can't.
Only I can if I'm...

398
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,378
Harold, Harold...

399
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:37,713
We don't have to rush
this thing, okay?

400
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:40,315
We can just talk it through.

401
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:45,587
How do you know my name?

402
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:47,689
Of course you know my name.

403
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,425
You know my birthday,
my blood type,

404
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:51,726
my shoe size...

405
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:52,827
Everything!

406
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,198
You don't know
what I know though.

407
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:57,565
Suzy... oh!

408
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:02,003
You don't know...
you're a liar!

409
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,237
You're a liar!

410
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,107
I don't have the shot!

411
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:11,178
Harold, stop right there!

412
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,581
It's okay...

413
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,083
Oh! Suzy...
It's okay, Suzy.

414
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,151
It's okay.

415
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,519
Daddy's...
Daddy's here.

416
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,620
<i>Thank you, Harold.</i>

417
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,055
Thank you for that.

418
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,291
Harold...

419
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,758
Don't worry,
daddy's got you.

420
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,493
<i>- Harold! Harold!</i>
<i>- Daddy's here, Suzy.</i>

421
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,430
Harold, you don't need
to do that.

422
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:40,603
<i>Ed?</i>

423
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:43,896
<i>Ed?</i>

424
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,585
Can you keep going?

425
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,221
<i>The baby, was she okay?</i>

426
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:51,289
You want a happy ending.

427
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:53,691
Everybody does.

428
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,395
But when things don't work out,
you know who they blame?

429
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,165
I could see the baby,
right there,

430
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:03,133
but there was nothing
that I could do about it.

431
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:05,837
<i>We couldn't shoot
- he'd drop her.</i>

432
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:07,905
<i>We couldn't rush him...</i>

433
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,105
We had to wait
and see what he'd do.

434
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,507
<i>Ed, status?</i>

435
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:11,508
If he jumps, I'm
going in after him.

436
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:12,776
We need that police boat
here now.

437
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:14,177
- No!
- Harold!

438
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,413
Stay back!
Just leave us alone!

439
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,615
You have to let me through!
Please! Please! Harold?!

440
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:19,816
Calm down, ma'am.

441
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:21,217
Harold?! Calm down. Who are you?

442
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:23,119
- I'm Jordana Hauser.
- Harold Beamer's next of kin?

443
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:24,487
Yeah. Where is he? Okay.

444
00:16:24,554 --> 00:16:25,954
- What did he do?
- Calm, calm...

445
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:26,856
The officer wouldn't
tell me what he did.

446
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:28,290
Calm down, all right?

447
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:30,225
Now, we're dealing with a very
dangerous situation here.

448
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,427
Harold's up there,

449
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,362
he's in an extreme manic state.

450
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,631
He took a baby,
he calls her Suzy.

451
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:38,367
Suzy's his daughter.
She's our daughter.

452
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:40,802
But she's right there.

453
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:45,874
Stay back!

454
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,510
Okay, Harold, just wait.

455
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:49,677
<i>Nooooo!</i>

456
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,379
<i>Harold, don't do it.</i>

457
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:52,847
Harold, no!

458
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,048
<i>What's happening, ed?</i>

459
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:55,850
He's climbing.
He's still got the baby.

460
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,985
Sam, get up to the next deck.

461
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,865
Harold, Harold,
take it easy, okay?

462
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:14,567
We're not trying to hurt you.

463
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:15,835
There's nowhere
left to go, Harold.

464
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,738
<i>Just take it easy.</i>
<i>It's okay.</i>

465
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,343
No. You don't understand.
You don't understand...

466
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,745
<i>Harold!</i>

467
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:27,880
Harold.

468
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,854
<i>Ed, stop.</i>

469
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,256
No, I can do this.

470
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,591
I know, I
know, just breathe.

471
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,759
<i>Look at me.</i>

472
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:41,827
<i>Any numbness?</i>
<i>Dizziness?</i>

473
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,894
I'm not having a heart attack.

474
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:45,330
I don't think it's your heart.

475
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,065
I think we should go back.

476
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,066
Start again.

477
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,234
Okay, fine. Fine.

478
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,402
<i>The subject had stopped,</i>

479
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,570
<i>he was unresponsive to our...</i>

480
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:53,537
<i>No. Not there.</i>

481
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,340
Back - to the start
of your day.

482
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,342
Why? Because we go
through this every time.

483
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,877
For the past two months,
one week, and five days,

484
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,411
you come in, crack some jokes,

485
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,980
you tell me I'm not a cop,

486
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:04,747
and the moment we get
to something real,

487
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:07,084
like your marriage,
your son, May Dalton,

488
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:08,251
You race
through the session,

489
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,752
and then you leave.

490
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,421
I don't need to
talk about all that.

491
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:12,856
- Ed, you're having a panic attack.
- I've got a job to do.

492
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:15,192
Not if you walk
out of here you don't.

493
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,593
- Excuse me?
- I'm not your sarge, Ed,

494
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,162
but I am a psychologist
with specific obligations,

495
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,531
like reporting that a patient
who works with the public,

496
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,932
who,
in my professional opinion,

497
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,001
is not fit for duty.

498
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:26,235
"Not fit for duty?"

499
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:27,803
<i>Let me tell you something.</i>

500
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:30,373
I have faced every board,
every panel, and every trial,

501
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,740
and I have been cleared!

502
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,009
I'm not talking about that, Ed.

503
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:37,312
Where were you
when I had to shoot May Dalton?

504
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,014
I mean, who are you
to judge me?

505
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:40,215
Nobody was there,

506
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:41,182
but everybody wants
to judge me.

507
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,618
Who's judging you, Ed?

508
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:44,052
You said yourself,
you were "protecting" us.

509
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,053
Because you don't know
what it's like!

510
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,187
Then tell me.

511
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,625
Tell me.

512
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,426
- You wanna know?
- Yes.

513
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:54,428
Okay.

514
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:00,467
I woke up this morning,
in my basement, alone...

515
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,938
<i>Like I've done every day</i>
<i>for the last two months</i>

516
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,039
<i>because it's just easier</i>
<i>that way.</i>

517
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:08,041
Clark! Clark!

518
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,876
Come on, you don't have
to do that right now.

519
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:11,110
Come on, it's okay.

520
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:12,311
He has a recital tomorrow.

521
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:13,446
A recital?

522
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:14,881
Why am I the last to know
about this?

523
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:17,951
So, no, I wouldn't say

524
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,920
we're really "connecting"
right now.

525
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:22,869
Okay. And work?

526
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,063
All right...

527
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,000
All right, all right,
all right!

528
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:36,502
I mean, is that what
you wanna hear...

529
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,603
That I'm sleeping alone?
That my kid won't talk to me?

530
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,338
And deep breathing
before facing your team?

531
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:41,606
It's not like
I let anyone see that.

532
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,275
Why don't you?

533
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:46,878
'Cause I'm their team leader.
Okay, I'm their team leader.

534
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:48,613
<i>When we're on a call,</i>

535
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:51,483
<i>when it all goes to hell,</i>
<i>they look to me...</i>

536
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:55,620
<i>To be calm, to be in control,</i>
<i>to keep them all safe.</i>

537
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:57,722
<i>That's my job.</i>

538
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,156
Nobody wants to know
about the rest of it.

539
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:01,492
They don't need to see that.

540
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,926
Thank you.

541
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,628
For what?

542
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:06,663
For being honest.

543
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:14,871
So... you were on
the ferry.

544
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,539
The baby was safe?

545
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,810
No, the baby wasn't safe...

546
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,279
<i>That was the problem,</i>

547
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,848
<i>and it was still the priority.</i>

548
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,750
Mr. Beamer?

549
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:29,185
<i>Officer Callaghan
took lead on negotiation.</i>

550
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,021
Harold?

551
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,154
<i>We know women are
less threatening</i>

552
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,824
<i>to subjects like Harold.</i>

553
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:37,226
I'm Jules.

554
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:39,328
I'm hoping that
we can sort this out.

555
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:42,498
Can you tell me
where you're trying to go?

556
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,267
We're on the Center Island
Ferry, aren't we?

557
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:46,936
You're a musician?

558
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:49,403
I see that you're doing scales.

559
00:20:49,471 --> 00:20:52,073
Don't patronize me.
What kind?

560
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,574
I'm sorry?

561
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,777
What kind of
scales was I playing?

562
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:56,945
I don't know.

563
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:58,412
<i>They're exercises.</i>

564
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,182
They're the uh...
Hanon exercises.

565
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:03,584
Yeah.

566
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:11,725
Can you tell us about
your music, Harold?

567
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:14,762
<i>When we started dating,
he was already "eccentric."</i>

568
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,429
I'd been second flute
long enough

569
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:18,732
to know the genius type.

570
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,701
He played Chopin by ear
at age 11...

571
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:24,871
And... the Philharmonic
at age 21.

572
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,308
When did he stop
just being "eccentric"?

573
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:30,442
Um...

574
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:34,047
It was after Suzy was born.

575
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:36,181
He lived for her.

576
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:38,784
He would sleep
next to her crib,

577
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:40,719
<i>in case she woke up,</i>

578
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:44,622
and he would play music to her
on this little...

579
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:48,560
Um, it was a little toy piano
that we had.

580
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,662
She was just six months old,

581
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,930
but he was sure that
she was smiling, you know;

582
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:55,833
that she could hear the music.

583
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:59,704
I didn't notice the change,
at first.

584
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:02,306
That he stopped going
to rehearsals,

585
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:03,974
and then he stopped
playing concerts.

586
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:06,744
You know, he would only
play for Suzy.

587
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:10,146
The ridiculous orchestra,
the people listening...

588
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:12,515
<i>They couldn't really hear.</i>
<i>I mean, not really.</i>

589
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:16,106
My Jordana could hear,
but... not anymore.

590
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:19,089
Suzy, she could hear!

591
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:21,725
I would play for her,
and it was beautiful.

592
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:25,127
<i>When he's lucid, he
knows that he needs help.</i>

593
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:27,462
And then he starts
to take his meds

594
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,397
and he says
he can't hear the music,

595
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:31,100
so then he stops taking
his meds

596
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:33,335
and then this happens and...

597
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:36,972
You know, we couldn't
stay together...

598
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,007
I paid for an apartment though,
you know,

599
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,742
and a piano.

600
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,211
And I knew if I played
and I practiced,

601
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,479
and I played,
and then she would hear.

602
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,749
<i>My Suzy would hear.</i>

603
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:50,417
And then one day, a miracle...

604
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,653
She's right next door.

605
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:55,756
<i>And I played, and she listened.</i>

606
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,192
It was good.

607
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,129
<i>I called him a week
ago, and he was raving.</i>

608
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:06,566
Something about "Suzy,"
and "the music," and...

609
00:23:06,634 --> 00:23:08,802
He hadn't eaten in days.

610
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,871
He needed help,
so I called the movers

611
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,738
to take his piano
to the hospital,

612
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:14,173
so that he could play.

613
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:15,440
But then when we got there
this morning,

614
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:17,176
he wouldn't even come out
to see us.

615
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:18,510
And then the neighbour came out

616
00:23:18,578 --> 00:23:19,779
and told you that
her baby was sleeping.

617
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,380
Oh God, no, is that the baby?

618
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:22,982
Did I do this?

619
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,184
No, this is no one's fault.

620
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:27,886
You know,
if you could just see him,

621
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:31,722
<i>if you just knew him</i>
<i>the way that he really is...</i>

622
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,125
<i>This is not who he is.</i>

623
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:37,962
<i>He was just staring at me.</i>

624
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,032
Not Jules.
Not the baby.

625
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:44,135
Me.

626
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:47,471
Why do you think
he was staring at you?

627
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,708
It didn't matter.

628
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:52,242
He believed what he believed.

629
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:55,112
He posed a threat to himself
and to others.

630
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,079
We had no choice.

631
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:57,214
Liar!

632
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:58,582
Put it down, Harold!

633
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,483
I would never hurt her!
I would never hurt her!

634
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:05,388
And the subject
was neutralized.

635
00:24:06,324 --> 00:24:08,257
<i>Is that what</i>
<i>you wanted to hear?</i>

636
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:10,727
Am I "fit for duty" now?

637
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:13,062
I'm sorry, I just...

638
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:15,532
I don't understand
how this man

639
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,265
went from telling you
about the music,

640
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:19,435
and his daughter,
to pointing a gun.

641
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:21,770
He was mentally ill.
He was in a manic phase.

642
00:24:21,838 --> 00:24:24,673
But what happened in the time
between him staring at you

643
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,408
and the shot being taken?

644
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:29,177
<i>What happened to Jules?</i>
<i>Or the baby?</i>

645
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:30,579
What're you leaving out, Ed?

646
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:31,613
<i>I told you.</i>

647
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:33,681
The man was shot.
He was killed.

648
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:34,782
Yes.

649
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:39,620
But you didn't shoot him,
did you, Ed?

650
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,389
<i>I told you my dad was a cop.</i>

651
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:42,623
<i>So I know that,</i>

652
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,258
after a shooting
in the line of duty,

653
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:47,328
an officer must turn everything
over to the SIU as evidence...

654
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:49,295
His notebook, his gear...

655
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:52,899
His uniform.

656
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:54,501
<i>So, tell me,</i>

657
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,372
what really happened
on the ferry?

658
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:18,006
<i>Ed?</i>

659
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:19,107
<i>Ed.</i>

660
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:21,809
I wanna help you,

661
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:25,046
but you have to be honest
with me.

662
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:27,515
Tell me what happened.

663
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:33,154
He just wouldn't stop
staring at me.

664
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:37,791
Harold, we're right
here if you wanna talk.

665
00:25:37,858 --> 00:25:39,460
How did you know?

666
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:42,996
The Hanon exercises -
how... how did you know?

667
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:46,233
<i>Ed, his voice is
lowered; He's personalizing.</i>

668
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:48,335
He might be transitioning
to a lucid phase.

669
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,471
I got the shot.

670
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:51,805
Sam's covering, ed.

671
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,508
If Harold's reaching out to you,
you reach back.

672
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:58,511
My son plays, Harold.

673
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:00,379
The piano?

674
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:02,148
And the cello.

675
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:05,151
Oh...
The soul of the orchestra.

676
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:16,161
Hi, princess.

677
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,071
Do you know that one?

678
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:30,274
I do. That's...

679
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:32,510
Clair... Clair uh...

680
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:34,278
Clair de Lune.

681
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:36,014
Debussy.

682
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:38,882
That's right, that's right.

683
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,886
<i>And all of a sudden, he seemed...
happy,</i>

684
00:26:42,954 --> 00:26:44,987
<i>and for a second, so did I.</i>

685
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:47,690
Why do you think that is?

686
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,092
It made me
think of Clark.

687
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:54,864
But that's not the point.

688
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,932
We had to move fast
and get into reality testing.

689
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,567
Find areas you agree on:

690
00:26:58,635 --> 00:26:59,735
"The sun is out,
you are a man..."

691
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,703
We're on a ferry.
I'm a police officer.

692
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:03,805
And that's a baby at your feet,
right, Harold?

693
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,343
Yeah, yeah... it's...
It's my Suzy.

694
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:10,912
Okay.

695
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,016
Harold, can I ask you
how you know that's Suzy?

696
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,459
I know, I don't...

697
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:27,961
Wait. Wait, stop!

698
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,666
No problem, Harold.
You okay?

699
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,200
Between me and you,

700
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,102
there seems to be a lot of
people with guns around here.

701
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,172
Probably not the best place
for a baby, right?

702
00:27:40,174 --> 00:27:42,175
Now, I know that you don't
wanna hurt anybody here,

703
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:44,711
especially not that baby.

704
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:46,512
Look at this.

705
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:50,115
I did this, didn't I?

706
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:51,516
It's okay, that's
why we're here

707
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:53,651
to help you out of it.

708
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,687
<i>I thought it was working.</i>

709
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,989
But... then he stared at me
again,

710
00:27:58,925 --> 00:27:59,925
<i>and this time...</i>
<i>It was different.</i>

711
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,226
Different how?

712
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:04,696
He didn't seem curious...
or interested in me.

713
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:06,296
This time...

714
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:07,998
he looked like he finally
understood something.

715
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,068
It won't ever stop.

716
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:13,838
I'll go away
and I'll take the pills,

717
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:17,842
and I'll... I'll think
that I'm better, you know?

718
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:20,977
I'll just end up back here
all over again.

719
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:22,645
Okay, he's bottoming out.

720
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,413
Ed, Sam, watch for a shift
to suicide.

721
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:26,349
<i>Jules, if his attention</i>
<i>is on himself,</i>

722
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:27,483
<i>you get the baby.</i>

723
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:28,818
Harold, let me ask you,

724
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:30,019
you were going over
to the island, right?

725
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,420
What's going on there?
Talk to me.

726
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:34,791
Harold I came to get
my piano, they were...

727
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:38,026
They were banging on the door
and Suzy was upset.

728
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:40,195
I mean, she doesn't know,
she's just a baby.

729
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:43,265
All the noise,
I just wanted it to be quiet,

730
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:45,033
so I could hear.

731
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:46,869
The music?

732
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:47,970
Yeah.

733
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,007
When I...
When I hear the music,

734
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:54,809
<i>it tells me that there's love</i>
<i>inside me and everyone,</i>

735
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:56,710
and that we're all safe.

736
00:28:57,746 --> 00:29:00,114
<i>And then I take my pills,</i>

737
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:03,317
and I listen to the doctor,
and there's no music.

738
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:04,752
It's just me.

739
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:06,754
And all the things
that I've done

740
00:29:06,822 --> 00:29:08,789
and the people
that I've hurt...

741
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:10,356
My Jordana, my-my...

742
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,359
<i>My Suzy...</i>

743
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:14,594
Harold, I know you love
your daughter,

744
00:29:14,662 --> 00:29:16,830
but what happened
is in the past.

745
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:18,865
<i>But I need you to do</i>
<i>the right thing now.</i>

746
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,801
No, it is not.
It's...

747
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,369
It's in here.

748
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:25,470
It's in here
and I can't make it stop.

749
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:27,273
I can't!

750
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,076
I'm so sorry...

751
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:35,281
I think we should go now, Suzy.

752
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:39,418
Harold...

753
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:41,953
Are you sure of that's-
that's Suzy, Harold?

754
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:43,721
- Yes!
<i>- Okay.</i>

755
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:45,190
Yes, it is.

756
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:49,360
You don't think I know
my own daughter?

757
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:50,695
I didn't say that.

758
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:52,263
You're a liar!

759
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:53,131
<i>Careful,
Eddie, he's splitting;</i>

760
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,532
he's making you the enemy.

761
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,766
- Harold!
- Liar!

762
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,000
Harold, I'm here to help you!

763
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:58,601
- No!
- Look at me! Talk to me!

764
00:29:58,669 --> 00:29:59,703
No!
I wouldn't hurt her!

765
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,305
Drop it!

766
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:02,706
- I would never hurt her!
- Put the gun down!

767
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:03,874
<i>- Put it down!</i>
<i>- I would never hurt her!</i>

768
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:10,747
<i>Ed? Ed, where are you?</i>

769
00:30:10,815 --> 00:30:14,543
I'm right there...
in the moment...

770
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,355
The moment I kill someone.

771
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:22,124
<i>Okay. Describe it for me.</i>

772
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:24,761
<i>I use a four count
breathing method</i>

773
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:28,531
<i>to keep my heart rate</i>
<i>at 40 to 50 beats per minute.</i>

774
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,834
<i>I maintain light pressure</i>
<i>on the trigger of my weapon.</i>

775
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:36,004
<i>I aim for the center mass,</i>
<i>in order to make the kill.</i>

776
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:39,475
<i>But it isn't
that simple, is it?</i>

777
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:40,942
<i>I read somewhere</i>
<i>that in World War II,</i>

778
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,578
only 10 or 20 percent
of soldiers

779
00:30:42,645 --> 00:30:44,312
actually fired at the enemy.

780
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:45,880
The rest aimed above,
to the side...

781
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:47,749
Anywhere but at the man.

782
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:50,518
<i>Because... it isn't easy,</i>
<i>is it,</i>

783
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:52,152
to go against
the fundamental instinct

784
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,256
not to kill
a fellow human being.

785
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:57,592
I mean, that's why we train
to break that instinct.

786
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,127
So that in the moment,
we don't think.

787
00:31:00,195 --> 00:31:01,795
<i>It's like a switch</i>
<i>on or off, black or white.</i>

788
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:03,997
"Connect, respect, protect."

789
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,332
Or kill.

790
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,937
<i>It is my job now.</i>
<i>This is what I must do.</i>

791
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:12,406
No!
I would never...

792
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:13,940
<i>The imminent
threat is clear.</i>

793
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:15,675
<i>The target is clear.</i>

794
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,710
<i>I have the shot...</i>

795
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:21,414
<i>And I can't do it.</i>

796
00:31:23,784 --> 00:31:25,785
Then it all went wrong.

797
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29,121
I didn't take the shot.

798
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,525
I think you're right.

799
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:34,626
I don't think
I can do this job anymore.

800
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:44,184
How do I go back now?

801
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,420
I mean, what do I tell them?
What do I tell my family?

802
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,189
Well, first, we need to finish.

803
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,825
You didn't hear me?
I am finished.

804
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:55,228
No, Ed, on the ferry.
Finish what happened there.

805
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:57,430
<i>You don't think
I know my own daughter?</i>

806
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,098
You're a liar!

807
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,399
- Harold!
- Liar!

808
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,067
<i>Harold, I'm here to help you!</i>

809
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:03,635
<i>Look at me!</i>
<i>Talk to me!</i>

810
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:04,970
No!

811
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:29,960
<i>What happened?!</i>

812
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:31,896
<i>What'd you do?!</i>

813
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:34,063
<i>What happened up there, Ed?</i>

814
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:37,133
<i>Eddie!</i>
<i>What happened up there?</i>

815
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,704
Ed!

816
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,808
Ed!

817
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:46,610
<i>Somebody tell me something, please!</i>

818
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:48,444
<i>What happened?!</i>

819
00:32:48,512 --> 00:32:50,946
<i>What'd you do?</i>

820
00:32:51,014 --> 00:32:55,150
<i>Oh no! Tell me what happened,</i>
<i>please, somebody!</i>

821
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:56,651
<i>No, please!</i>

822
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,088
Subject's neutralized.

823
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:03,324
Ed, what're you doing?

824
00:33:03,392 --> 00:33:05,427
Gotta fix him up;
His family's down there.

825
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:08,463
Hey.

826
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:10,031
They can't see him like this.

827
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:12,800
Ed,
it's a crime scene.

828
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:16,737
You can't do anything
to his body, okay?

829
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:25,245
<i>I couldn't stop... looking.</i>

830
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,613
At what?

831
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:29,615
At the hole...

832
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,887
Where his heart used to be...

833
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:39,124
<i>When he was still alive.</i>

834
00:33:39,192 --> 00:33:41,160
<i>Step aside.</i>

835
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,161
<i>Who took the shot?</i>

836
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,495
I did.

837
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,763
Braddock, you're sequestered,

838
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:46,064
you have to relinquish
your firearm.

839
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:49,167
You know the drill,
I'll take you to SIU.

840
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:50,802
The baby...

841
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,804
She's okay. She's
on the dock with her mom.

842
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:54,539
Says she wants to talk to you,
say thank you.

843
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:55,707
Jordana and the daughter?

844
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:56,808
What happened, Eddie?

845
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:57,676
Parker, what're you doing?

846
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,743
I've gotta go.

847
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,011
Ed, you're a witness officer;

848
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,780
the team stays
until Braddock and I go.

849
00:34:02,848 --> 00:34:04,314
I didn't take the shot.

850
00:34:04,382 --> 00:34:05,449
Hold up, buddy,
I'll come with you.

851
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:06,917
I got it, no.

852
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:30,940
<i>I just drove.</i>

853
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:32,173
<i>I got in the truck,</i>
<i>the books were in the truck,</i>

854
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:34,209
and I just had to get here.
I don't know why.

855
00:34:34,276 --> 00:34:36,244
I just had to get here.

856
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:41,361
I blew the call.
Another person's dead.

857
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:43,519
What am I gonna do?

858
00:34:43,586 --> 00:34:45,621
Okay.
You blew the call...

859
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:47,422
Not sure that's what I heard.

860
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,089
Can we do a little bit
of reality testing,

861
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:50,525
see what we agree on,
the two of us?

862
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:51,859
- Yeah.
- All right.

863
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:53,995
The baby was saved.

864
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:56,864
<i>Yeah.</i>

865
00:34:56,932 --> 00:34:58,232
<i>The passengers were saved.</i>

866
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:00,134
<i>Right.</i>

867
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:03,170
<i>You profiled your
subject, in order to negotiate.</i>

868
00:35:03,238 --> 00:35:06,006
When all other options
were exhausted,

869
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:07,841
your teammate was ready.

870
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,743
Whoever has the shot
takes the shot.

871
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,150
<i>So it all went
how it was meant to,</i>

872
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:18,451
<i>based on what you tell me,</i>

873
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,852
and based on how
you trained them.

874
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,487
No, not them -
not them at all. Me.

875
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:24,690
It's black or white;
you take the shot or you don't.

876
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:26,158
- You kill or you don't.
- Yes!

877
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,226
And if you kill, you're judged,

878
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,662
you're blamed.

879
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:30,589
Yes.

880
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:34,033
<i>And if you don't
kill, you judge, you blame...</i>

881
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,733
Yourself.

882
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:40,538
<i>Is this really about whether</i>
<i>or not you took the shot?</i>

883
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,406
Why are you here?

884
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,975
<i>To hear me tell you</i>
<i>you're a monster?</i>

885
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:46,410
<i>Or to tell you why</i>
<i>you can't talk to your son?</i>

886
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,612
- What do you want, Ed?
- I don't know!

887
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,313
- Yes you do.
- I don't know!

888
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,381
<i>Yes you do, and
you have to tell me.</i>

889
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,182
You have to say it.

890
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,151
What's wrong with me?

891
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,620
What's wrong with me?

892
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:59,522
I see these people -
everyone I ever...

893
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,124
May Dalton?

894
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,659
I'm up on a roof, I see
her through my scope...

895
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,408
Every day, every night.

896
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,332
Did your father ever talk
about that?

897
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:12,301
No.

898
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,138
I mean, maybe that's what
the drinking was about,

899
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:17,840
the nights away...

900
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:21,310
<i>Until my sixteenth birthday</i>
<i>when he didn't come back.</i>

901
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,914
I try to look for him
every once in a while,

902
00:36:25,982 --> 00:36:28,016
but, you know, so far...

903
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:29,217
You know, maybe one day
he'll come back

904
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:33,488
and tell me what it
was like for him.

905
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:36,457
But so far,
he hasn't had the courage.

906
00:36:36,525 --> 00:36:38,259
Not like you.

907
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:39,727
I couldn't do my job.
That's not "courage."

908
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:40,894
I'm not talking about
your job, Ed.

909
00:36:40,962 --> 00:36:43,263
I'm talking about you.

910
00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:46,166
Why did you come here?

911
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:47,801
Harold said he was going
to the island to be safe.

912
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:49,302
Maybe that's what
I was looking for.

913
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,239
No. Harold was going
to the island to escape.

914
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:55,609
You came here
for something else.

915
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,979
Let me show you.

916
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:03,049
Come with me.

917
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:22,600
It hurts to do your job.

918
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:26,838
It hurts to take a life.

919
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:29,173
<i>It hurts to be the one</i>
<i>who stands on a rooftop...</i>

920
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,574
<i>or a boat...</i>

921
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:31,776
and kills.

922
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:33,844
Even when it's right, it hurts.

923
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:37,514
<i>So you can quit your job,</i>
<i>stop talking to your son,</i>

924
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:40,317
<i>or run away from it all</i>
<i>like my father, or Harold,</i>

925
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:41,686
but none of that
is gonna help you face

926
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:43,920
the one thing you're actually
running away from.

927
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,524
So the question is, Ed,

928
00:37:48,592 --> 00:37:52,428
can you allow yourself
to feel the pain?

929
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:06,975
How?

930
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:09,144
How do I face that?

931
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:29,163
She was eighteen...

932
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,966
she was eighteen.

933
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:34,467
She had her whole...

934
00:38:34,535 --> 00:38:35,535
she had her whole life
ahead of her.

935
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:37,604
I took it.

936
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:38,705
I took it!

937
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:41,975
I took it...

938
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:46,646
She was...
eighteen years old.

939
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:48,647
She had her whole life
ahead of her

940
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:49,915
and I took it.

941
00:38:51,218 --> 00:38:52,818
How can I face that?

942
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:55,721
How can my kid
look me in the eye?

943
00:38:56,656 --> 00:38:58,724
You know what I see
when I look in your eye?

944
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,560
<i>I see a cop,</i>

945
00:39:01,628 --> 00:39:02,928
a father,

946
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:04,195
a hero,

947
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:05,263
a man.

948
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:10,334
<i>I'd be worried about you</i>
<i>if you didn't feel like this.</i>

949
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:11,636
I'd be worried about you

950
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:15,473
if you didn't come
to see me today.

951
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,041
<i>But I'm not.</i>

952
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:21,645
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

953
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:23,446
Just remember, Ed,

954
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:25,382
the job is black and white,

955
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,018
but how you feel isn't.

956
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:30,575
That's... that's okay?

957
00:39:30,922 --> 00:39:34,299
Yeah... that's okay.

958
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:41,664
I've stood on so many
of these rooftops.

959
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:43,800
<i>You want your son
to look you in the eye,</i>

960
00:39:43,867 --> 00:39:46,468
you need to tell him how it is.

961
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:51,540
I got a few people
I gotta talk to.

962
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:57,679
Yeah, there's a few people
I think I need to talk to.

963
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:16,452
Sorry, I can do this later.

964
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,221
No. It's okay.

965
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,322
Don't stop.

966
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:23,760
It's beautiful.
