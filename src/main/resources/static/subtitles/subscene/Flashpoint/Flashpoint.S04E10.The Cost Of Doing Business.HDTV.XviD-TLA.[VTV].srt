First Monday of the month, my turn.
Hi.

20

Double double,

21

Well, since I have news.

23

I was hoping I was wrong,
but I knew,

54
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,602

I'll hand it off myself.

Okay, any idea
where in the park?

76
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,346
I'm sending out a map

That's a big park.

78

Spike:
Three acres of urban wilderness.

79
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,551
I'll see if I can
narrow it down.

80

86

(Rustling sound)

88
00:03:58,595 --> 00:03:59,562

91

Skateboards.

92
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:07,035

97

Talk to witnesses
and find the girl,

98
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,010
and hope we're not too late.

99
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:26,053
It's in there?
Yeah.

100
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,454
All of it?

Ed:
Sam.

102
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,060

Raf: Backup on the way.

109

The girl you took
that bag from.

<i>She sounded pretty scared</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

118
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:04,323
It's what happens when you

Let's not get any deeper.
Where is she?

you get someone else

132
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,053
He knows the protocol.

133
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,755

299
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,904

304
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,445

318
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:23,273
Unreported?
Five times that, easily.

319
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:25,275
Dealing with these gangs
is the cost of doing business.

320
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:26,676
What about the police?

321
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,612

Gangs give 'em a cut.

Does it happen up here?

323
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,048

of what we've seen down South -

324
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:34,117
the same wording,
the same timing,

325
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:35,519
the disposable phone

326

Though the price tag
is a little higher.

327
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,854
Target's more important?

328
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,290
They took Bridgefield's CEO -
Colin Hamilton.

329
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:45,794

they call back

00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:49,798

to deliver the cash.

333
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,133
Maybe not,

334
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,401
because now they know
we're involved.

335
00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:54,102
Or they might use Hamilton
as an example,

336
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,304
so that they're not crossed
in the future, right?

337
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:57,438
Yeah.

349
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:18,358
who were kidnapped in Mexico,
they live in town.

350
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:19,993
Who are they?

351
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:21,461
<i>Spike:</i> <i>Carl Miller</i>
<i>and Esmie Vargas.</i>

352
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,129
Maybe the victims
are gonna have insight

353
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:24,764
on how they're guarded
and where they're kept.

354
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:26,232
Spike,
you got addresses?

355
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,833
Yeah, Vargas lives downtow.

356
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,868
Jules, I'm sending you
the address right now.

357
00:13:29,936 --> 00:13:31,537
Jules: I'm on it.
Spike: Carl Miller.

358
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:32,905
Carl Miller lives
in Scarborough.

359
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:35,174
Good.
I'll call him from the truck.

360
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:39,312
Larson: We first caught
sight of these guys

361
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:40,946
three months ago.

362
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:42,914
Orders are to come down hard
before they get established.

363
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:44,082
We think they've grabbed
the CEO

364
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:45,317
of an oil and gas company

365
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:46,951
and are holding him
for ransom.

366
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,086
Well, kidnapping's certainly
part of their bag of tricks

367
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:49,487
down South.

368
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:50,655
You got any idea
where they might be holding him?

369
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:52,691
Well, they bought a flower
import warehouse,

370
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,226
which we think they're using
as a front.

371
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,227
Flowers and gangs...

372
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,661
It's a good cover.

373
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:58,096
We've had surveillance on 'em
for a month,

374
00:13:58,163 --> 00:13:59,763
but nothing
we can move on yet.

375
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:01,398
Okay, maybe we can help
each other out here.

376
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,334
Or maybe you destroy
a month of work on a hunch.

377
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:06,537
Look, hehe clock is ticking
on our victim here, okay?

378
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,572
<i>Wordy:</i> <i>I've read the file.
</i> <i>I could go with them,</i>

379
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,574
keep 'em on a leash.

380
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,111
All right.
A short leash, Wordsworth.

381
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:15,278
This is on you.

382
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,412

384
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:23,119
Parker: Mr. Miller, once again,
thank you for taking the time.

385
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:24,587
Yeah, happy to help.

386
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,322
Uh, you're saying that M2
may have moved up here?

387
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,857
Parker: Yeah, that's
what it looks like.

388
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:30,192
We were hoping you can tell us
what happened in Mexico.

389
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,926
<i>Carl:</i> <i>Ah, well, it all
went down</i> <i>pretty quick.</i>

390

what do you think
would've happen

396
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:45,240
if the company hadn't paid?

397
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:49,343
They would have had no problem
killing me.

398
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:51,345
That was just business,
you know?

399
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:54,114
It's just business
I understand.

400
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:01,822

00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:05,858
Yes, every one.

403
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:06,893
Yeah.

404
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,461
She ran a lot of marathons, huh?

405
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:11,164
I'm getting tired
just looking at these.

406
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:13,032
<i>Woman:</i>
<i>Esmie never got tired.</i>

407
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,402
The only one who could
keep up with her

408
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:16,803
was her brother.

409
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,271
<i>But Esmie always wanted</i>
<i>to do more.</i>

410
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:20,673
Well, I know the feeling.

411
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,907
It takes a lot of hard work

412
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,075
and dedication
to run a marathon.

413
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:26,044
Yes.

414
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,979
She is not like that
anymore.

<i>Jules:</i>
<i>That's normal, Daniela.</i>

416
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,484
Something like this
can cause depression.

417
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:34,186
It takes a little while
to get back in the world.

418
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:36,921
No. It is not only that.

439

How can I help?

440
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,575
Do you know this guy,
the CEO, Hamilton?

441
00:16:34,642 --> 00:16:36,043
Martin:
Yeah, I trained him personally.

442
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,879
Breathing techniques
to stay calm,

443
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,813
positive visualization -
the works.

444
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,149
Parker: Any chance he's personalizing
himself to the kidnappers?

445
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:44,018
Martin: Instrumental
kidnappings like this,

446
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,186
where the only goal is money,
that's what we recommend.

447
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:48,221
You talk to them,
you try to find common ground.

448
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:49,822
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>That's good.</i>

449
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:51,258
Makes you seem more human.
Harder to hurt you that way.

450
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:54,494
If I did my job right,
he's got a chance.

451

(Long calming inhale)

452
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,834
Esmie:
People who've been kidnapped.

453
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,603
They all say the same thing:

454
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,140
That they never expected it
to happen to them.

455
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,242
And if anyone had
a blessed life,

456
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,676
it was me.

457
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:15,180
M2?
They took that all away.

There was a gun to my back,
and a hand over my mouth...

462
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:24,155
And then nothing.

520
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,988
Do you have anyone inside
we need to worry about?

521
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,659
<i>Wordy:</i> <i>We're wondering about
this guy,</i> <i>Miguel Salazar.</i>

522
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:50,993
Mexican undercovers
approached him

523
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:52,362
a couple of months ago.

524
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,130
It was looking promising...
then it fell apart.

525
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:55,398
Well,
once you're inside...

526
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:56,566
it's tough to get out.
That's right.

527
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,067
Do you have pictures
from the inside?

528
00:19:58,134 --> 00:19:59,734
Wordy: No, we haven't
gotten inside yet.

529
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,403
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Sarge, I got a
positive id</i> <i>from Esmie</i>

530
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:02,504
<i>on the guy at the
skate park -</i>

531
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:04,673
he was with M2 in Mexico.

532
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,409
She said that these guys like
to keep their captives close

533
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:08,544
and they're not afraid to act

534
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,844
if they don't get
what they want.

535
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:12,013
Well, the M.O. matches
what I got from Miller.

536
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,882
Warehouse is looking
better and better.

537
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,817
All right, boss,
let's take these guys down.

538
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:17,318
Copy that.

539
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:19,320
Spike:
Best bet is a loading bay

540
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:21,056
where they bring in
all the pretty flowers.

541
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:22,090
Just saw a delivery;

542
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:23,625
when the truck goes through,

543
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:25,126
<i>there's no one standing
guard</i> <i>on the door.</i>

544
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:26,828
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Okay, next truck
in,</i> <i>we follow.</i>

545
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:28,529
<i>These guys are looking</i>
<i>for an out-of-the-way place</i>

546
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:29,530
to keep their victim.

547
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,565
'Kay,
building like this,

548
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:31,732
probably poured
concrete floor,

549
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,100
so no basement.

550
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,401
But a warehouse's gotta have
a machine room -

551
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:35,669
air conditioning,
heating.

552
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:36,870
You gotta keep
those flowers healthy.

553
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:38,505
Okay, guys,
that's our target.

554
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,007
<i>Guns and gangs</i>
<i>cover our flanks,</i>

555
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:41,374
<i>keep a tight perimeter.</i>

556
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:42,476
<i>Spike, I need you back</i>
<i>down here.</i>

557
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,311
Copy that.

558
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:45,913
We go in hard,
we go in fast.

559
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:48,982
Okay, do not fire
unless you're fired on.

560
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,216
Ed:
Guys,

561
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:51,651
we're gonna stack up
at the entrance.

562
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,952
As soon as we get in,
we split up.

563
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,887
Alpha team -
Spike, Jules and myself.

564
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:55,888
You three will be Bravo team.

565
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,456
Jules,
what's your 20?

566
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:58,725
Seconds away.

567
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,559
As soon as she gets here,
we're a go.

568
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:01,794
Parker: All right, let's
stay ahead of the news.

569
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:03,261
Wordy:
Ed? Ed, Ed, Ed.

570
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,098
This is our shot
at getting these guys.

571
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,733
If we go in there
without a warrant or intel...?

572
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,701
Wordy, we got credible proof
there's a life in danger.

573
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,536
But is his life in danger
in there?

574
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,838
You wanna go knock
and ask him?

575
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,006
What if we don't find
anything?

576
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,273
We keep looking.

577
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,441
And the investigation
falls apart,

578
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,575
these guys walk...

579
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,809
Larson made it clear.

580
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:19,944
This is my ass
if it goes south.

581
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,114
Wordy, Wordy,
you got a better idea here?

582
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,214
Look,
we're coming with you.

583
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,282
Of course.
You cuff 'em,

584
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,651
but leave the driving
to us.

585
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,885
You sure?
I'm positive.

586
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,253
Wordy,
if this thing goes bad,

587
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,655
it's on me,
all right?

588
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:31,889
Give you some distance
with Larson.

589
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,957
You're gonna be all right,
trust me.

590
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,091
Thanks.

591
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,358
Okay, guys...

592
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:37,527
Let's get 'em.

593
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,981
(Vehicle rumbles)

594
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:48,915
Spike: Once that truck goes through,
we got a really short window.

595
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,684
Ed:
Go, go, go, go.

596
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:00,092
(Door clanks shut)

597
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:13,771
(Locks squeal)

598
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:17,775
SRU: (Whispered commands) Right down, right down!
On the ground now!

599
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:20,211
Ed:
Down on the ground now!

600
00:22:26,318 --> 00:22:27,519
<i>Okay, guys,</i>
<i>we got a set of stairs.</i>

601
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:29,086
Raf and Jules,
you take 'em.

602
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:32,056
<i>Wordy? Give us a minute,</i>
<i>we'll give you the sign.</i>

603
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:33,057
Ed: You good?
Parker: Yeah.

604
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,225
Let's go.

605
00:22:37,062 --> 00:22:39,230
No money,
no second chances.

606
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:40,498
Your company,

607
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:42,866
they don't care enough
to play by the rules.

608
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:43,967
I guess I'm gonna
have to show them

609
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:46,036
that we mean business again.

610
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:57,947
Sam: (Hushed tone) Show me your hands.
Now. On your knees.

611
00:22:58,015 --> 00:22:59,149
Ed:
Right there.

612
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:00,850
Sam: Drop your
weapon, drop it.

613
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,551
Now!

614
00:23:02,618 --> 00:23:03,919
Ed:
Wordy.

615
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:06,021
Jules: It's just a
lunch room up there.

616
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:06,988
It's all clear.

617
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:08,190
Sam:
Hammer and Anvil?

618
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:10,359
Ed:
We'll meet you in the back.

619
00:23:14,064 --> 00:23:15,230
(Panicked breaths)

620
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:18,366
What?
What do you have to say?

621
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:20,068
Hostage:
(Grunts)

622
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:22,770
J-just try again.
Try again.

623
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:24,338
I don't know
what went wrong.

624
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:26,507
All you have to do is call.
He'll get your money.

625
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:28,076
So they can have me
arrested?

626
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:29,277
No.

627
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:30,811
They don't care enough
about you to pay;

628
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:32,547
I don't care enough about you
to let you live.

629
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,955
Right there,
right there!

630
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:43,490
Hands in the air.
Put it down.

631
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:45,158
<i>Jules:</i> <i>In the air.
</i> <i>On the ground.</i>

632
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,793
Gang member: Okay, okay.
Jules: On your knees.

633
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,095
Jules: On your knees!
Get down!

634
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:50,829
Ed:
Someone on him!

635
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:59,238
I have a wife.
I got two kids.

636
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:00,973
I want this to be over
as much as you do.

637
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,009
Oh, it will be over
very soon.

638
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,850
Parker:
Go, go. Go!

639
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,724
SRU: Police! SRU! Right there!
Get down on the ground!

640
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,660
(Breathing shakily)
Please!

641
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:26,063
SRU: Drop your weapons! SRU!
On the ground now! Right there!

642
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,732
(Overlapping shouting)

643
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,166
Ed:
Where's Hamilton?

644
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,267
Where's Hamilton?

645
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,401
Hey! Ed!

646
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,471
Come here.

647
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,683
Where is he?
Where is he?!

648
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,518
No hablas English,
officer.

649
00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:49,986
Boss?

650
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:53,156
Parker: It's over, Eddie.
Everyone's cuffed.

651
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,759
He's not here.

652
00:24:58,327 --> 00:24:59,594
Hey, wordy?

653
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,363
What?

654
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,931
<i>Raf:</i> <i>Got something you might
wanna</i> <i>check out here.</i>

655
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:04,499
No way.

656
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,734
Raf: Yeah, it's a damn
good way to smuggle

657
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:07,136
and distribute product, man.

658
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:08,270
You can use that?

659
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:09,804
(Scoffs)

660
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,875
If even half of these ferns
are filled... uh huh.

661
00:25:13,942 --> 00:25:15,609
Larson's going to love me.

662
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:17,712
Ed: Well, like I said, rising
star of guns and gangs.

663
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,413
What about Hamilton?

664
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:21,015
Where else would they keep him,
Wordy?

665
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,484
M2 has dozens
of smaller hang-outs.

666
00:25:23,552 --> 00:25:24,819
Doesn't fit the profile.

667
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:29,222
There's a guy at the front desk
we need to talk to.

668
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,924
Let's do it.
Yeah.

669
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:36,663
That's the guy.

670
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:37,798
<i>Ed:</i> <i>So this is the
potential</i> <i>informer.</i>

671
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:38,999
Raf:
Should I talk to him?

672
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:39,966
Yeah,
see what you can get.

673
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:41,068
All right.

674
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,502
Can you take him
outta here?

675
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:47,873
You speak English?

676
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:50,409
I have nothing to say.

677
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:52,544
That's cool.
I get it.

678
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:53,946
It's the code,
right?

679
00:25:54,014 --> 00:25:56,148
Talk to the police...
Es malo para usted.

680
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:57,216
(Mocking)
Malo para usted...

681
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:59,217
Yeah, it's bad for you.

682
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:01,552
If you help us,
we can help you.

683
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,954
Your going to help me
when they deport me

684
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:04,756
back to Mexico, huh?

685
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:05,890
Come on.

686
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:09,293
Yeah, you're right.

687
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,262
All right, well...

688
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,997
Can you at least...
(Pda beeps)

689
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,131
Identify a guy?

690
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,934
I don't know him.

691
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:17,935
Really?

692
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:20,303
No.
Got the same tat.

693
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:34,416
Where's Colin?

694
00:26:34,484 --> 00:26:35,952
He wasn't in there.

695
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:37,754
These guys don't know
where he is?

696
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:39,055
They're not talking.

697
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:40,522
What the hell's
your new plan, Parker?

698
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,058
We'd a done this my way,
Hamilton would be at home

699
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:43,392
with his wife and kids
right now.

700
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,827
And next week another CEO
gets kidnapped.

701
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,464
There's no way we're letting M2
think that's how it works.

702
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:50,598
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>So we took a closer look</i>

703
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:51,767
and no one here
is a match

704
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:53,201
for our guy
at the skate park.

705
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,702
Raf: That's 'cause
he's not one of them.

706
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:56,972
Tattoo was on the wrong side
of the neck.

707
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,373
<i>It's always on the left</i>

708
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,641
<i>'cause it's closest</i>
<i>to the heart.</i>

709
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:00,441
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>he gets that wrong</i>

710
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:01,676
if he's the real deal.

711
00:27:01,744 --> 00:27:03,811
Okay, so if the guy
that we're chasing isn't M2,

712
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,814
then Esmie Vargas
lied to us.

713
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:09,884
Nah, she was keeping us
off track.

714
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:12,119
The kidnapping changed
her life.

715
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:13,387
She can't get even
with the gang,

716
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:14,588
so maybe she takes a shot
at the company

717
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:15,589
that put her there.

718
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:16,556
Martin:
Knowing we'd pay.

719
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:17,924
Well,
she had to have help

720
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:19,292
because she didn't pick up
that ransom by herself.

721
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,559
She's got a brother.

722
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:21,895
Her mom said that
she was close to him.

723
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:22,829
Spike: I've got the
brother right here.

724
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:23,997
His name's Joaquin.

725
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:25,064
He's a match
for our money man.

726
00:27:25,132 --> 00:27:26,065
It's on your PDAs.

727
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:27,200
Ed:
I got it.

728
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:30,636
Parker:
Okay, new game, team.

729
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:33,072
Everything we can
on Joaquin Vargas.

730
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,007
Parker: Jules...
Jules: I'll talk to Esmie.

731
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:36,842
Martin, come with me.

732
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:44,449
How is he?

733
00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:46,351
Terrified.
Good.

734
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:47,686
Maybe that's enough.

735
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:48,854
What do you mean?

736
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:49,821
You wanted him to feel
what you felt.

737
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,789
Yeah.
Okay, he does.

738
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:55,693
But I told you, Ez,
the police are on this now.

739
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,262
The money...
it's just not gonna come.

740
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,431
Joaquin, you haven't
called Terran back?

741
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:02,133
(Sighs)
You said you would!

742
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:03,134
That's why I came
to watch over him!

743
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:04,702
It's just too dangerous.

744
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:05,836
If I go to a drop-off,

745
00:28:05,903 --> 00:28:07,304
the police will be
everywhere, 'kay?

746
00:28:07,371 --> 00:28:09,840
Right now, they still don't
know who we are.

747
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:12,042
We should let him go.

748
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,977
What? And walk away?
Are you kidding?

749
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:15,545
This man has to pay
for what did to me!

750
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,947
There's gotta be
another way.

751
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:19,082
I can't work, I can't think,
I can't sleep,

752
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,218
I can barely walk!
I need this money.

753
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,351
I can help.

754
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:23,552
Do you have
$60,000 dollars?

755
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,653
Because you know
that's what it's gonna cost

756
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:26,021
just the first operation.

757
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:28,958
Plus airfare, and physio.
I...

758
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:32,328
Joaquin, Joaquin,
Joaquin...

759
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:35,130
Do you remember our first day
at St. Michael's?

760
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:36,966
Mami dropped us off
outside the school.

761
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:39,067
I held your hand
because she told me to.

762
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,069
She said you were going
to be scared,

763
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,571
but you weren't.
I was.

764
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,340
Yeah, you didn't come back
after lunch.

765
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:46,474
And you found me hiding
in the field

766
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,209
behind the school.

767
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:50,544
Do you remember
what you said to me?

768
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:54,348
When you run away,
you lose.

769
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:58,418
And to win, you have
to face them head on.

770
00:28:59,954 --> 00:29:02,356
You help me
get my life back, Joaquin.

771
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:04,191
Help me again.

772
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:08,228
Call them.

773
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,371
Hey, boss, just got off
the phone with Esmie's mom.

774
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,839
She's not there,
but she went to go-

775
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,908
Parker: Meet her brother?
Jules: Exactly.

776
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,309
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>No location though.</i>

777
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,044
We're looking into Joaquin now.

778
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:25,178
Good luck, man.

779
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,146
I know her.

780
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:29,115
Who?

781
00:29:29,182 --> 00:29:30,249
Esmie Vargas.

782
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:34,788
Call them.

783
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:41,294
<i>Ed:</i> <i>What do
you know about her?</i>

784
00:29:41,361 --> 00:29:42,795
Miguel: I can't help.
Raf: Yes, you can.

785
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:43,995
If she makes
the wrong move now

786
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:45,130
she won't live
through this.

787
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:46,398
And what happens to me?

788
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:49,668
Nobody needs to know about this,
Miguel.

789
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:51,703
<i>Raf:</i> <i>I can see that you
care</i> <i>about her, man.</i>

790
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:54,239
Now is your chance
to protect her.

791
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:56,074
I should have before.

792
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,012
(Door lock clicks,
Esmie gasps in fear)

793
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,281
<i>Miguel:</i> <i>I was one
of her kidnappers.</i>

794
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:05,817
Shhh, shhh, shhh,
shhh, shhh.

795
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:10,455
<i>She was so scared.</i>

796
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:18,095
(Scuffing of
approaching footsteps)

797
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,065
Gang member:
(Speaks in Spanish)

798
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:22,499
(Panting) What?

799
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,468
Gang member: Ayuda me.
Esmie: What? What? No!

800
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:26,903
Gang member: Ayuda me!
Esmie: No! Nooo!

801
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:27,972
Gang member:
(Speaks in Spanish)

802
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,606
Esmie:
(Shrieking)

803
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:33,309
(Cracking sound)

804
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:37,581
I did not help him,
but I did not stop.

805
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:39,483
<i>It was not supposed to be</i>
<i>this way.</i>

806
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,117
The first three times -
no problem.

807
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,519
We grabbed them,
the company pays.

808
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:44,387
Easy money.

809
00:30:44,455 --> 00:30:46,189
<i>But this time...</i>
<i>(Sighs)</i>

810
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:48,156
<i>No, no, no, no, no...</i>

811
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:51,727
I tried to help
the only way I could think of.

812
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:55,197
(Shushes Esmie)
It's me.

813
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:00,970
I'm sorry.

814
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:02,805
This will be over soon,
I promise.

815
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:06,273
<i>You will be free again.</i>

816
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:07,375
I don't know.

817
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:10,512
Mira me.

818
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:13,915
From now on,
I will protect you.

819
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:15,016
I promise you.

820
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:18,085

00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:22,990
This is my sun,
keep it close.

822
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:25,726
You are not alone.

823
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:29,530
Be strong.
You will be free.

(Door creaks closed)

825
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,771
It was a wooden carving
like this.

826
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,239
Ed:
(Unclear comment)

827
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:43,475
It's made of ironwood.
It's very, very strong.

828
00:31:43,544 --> 00:31:44,544
I thought it would help.

829
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,912
Ed:
It still might.

830
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,013

<i>Sam, can you trace it?</i>

834
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:53,117

Just don't answer yet.
I gotta pick up this call.

837

They're either gonna cut him or worse.
Okay, just keep him on the line, all right?

838
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:00,191
You know how to do that?
Yeah.

839
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,827
Terran.

840
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:04,996

00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:18,108
30 minutes.

847

Under the clock
at Union Station.

848

Last chance.

Yeah, uh, okay.

850
00:32:22,814 --> 00:32:24,981
Listen, how do I know
my guy's alive?

851
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:27,650
I need to know that he's alive

<i>And that he's in one piece.
</i>

There's too many bystanders.

They'll be quick to panic
and overreact.

866
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:53,942
Boss, Miguel Salizar,

867
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,410
he's one of the guys
who kidnapped her in Mexico.

868
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:56,777
The guy right there?
What he say?

869
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:58,846
Raf: Long story.
Ed: Fill you in on the way.

870
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:03,751
If it's Esmie Vargas,
this changes everything.

871
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,086
Not just about money
anymore.

872
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:06,854
Hamilton's training,
you know, to reach out,

873
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:08,155
uh, make a connection -

874
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:09,156
that's for instrumental
kidnapping,

875
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:10,958
<i>not emotional.</i>

876
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:11,925
<i>Parker:</i> <i>If he does that to
Esmie,</i> <i>it could backfire.</i>

877
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,693
It could escalate her.

878
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,228
How volatile is she?

879
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:16,229
<i>Martin:</i> <i>Well, you've
read</i> <i>the literature.</i>

880
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:17,363
Her reactions can run the gamut.

881
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:19,132
Uh, shock, numbness...

882
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,367
Yeah,
impaired decision-making.

883
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:23,103
<i>Hostile attitude</i>
<i>toward the world.</i>

884
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,904
I'm not talking
about generalities.

885
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:27,073
I'm talking about Esmie,
specifically.

886
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:32,210
You didn't talk to her
after she came back?

887
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,079
<i>Martin:</i> <i>Like a
decompression interview?</i>

888
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:36,048
No.
Not everybody needs it.

Oh, come on,
you don't believe that.

890
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:41,086
No. No, I don't.

891
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,188
But post-captivity programs
are expensive

892
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:44,622
and Hamilton was already
furious

893
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,090
at having to shell out
10-grand to these guys.

894
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,025
He didn't wanna do it again.

895
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,660
And he washed his hands.

896
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,662
Against my recommendation.

897
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,364
Well, whatever Esmie
is dealing with...

898
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,266

00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:47,111
Remember this?

1037
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,048
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1038
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,784
(Sobbing)

1039
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,586
Something like this
scars you,

1040
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:58,922
but you can't let it
define you.

1041
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,260
Let me help.

1042
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,235

Daniela:
Mi corazon, mi vida.

1051
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,296
How many people did we have
kidnapped in Mexico?

1052
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:43,031
Eighteen.

1053
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,867
<i>Hamilton:</i> <i>I want to
meet</i> <i>every one of them,</i>

1054
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:47,701
and try and make things right.

1055
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:50,304
Martin: Yes, sir.
I'll set it up.

1056
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:52,973
Parker:
Yeah, not for a while.

1057
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,909
Right.

1058
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:56,376
I can't be, uh,
in the middle of a park

1059
00:40:56,445 --> 00:40:57,711
waving a gun around.

1060
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:00,247
It sets a bad example.
Bad example, yeah.

1061
00:41:02,016 --> 00:41:03,049
Parker?

1062
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,486
Thanks for your help.

1063
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,527
That was a good takedown.

1064
00:41:14,595 --> 00:41:15,995
Good talk.

1065
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:18,530
What're we gonna do?

1066
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:21,733
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>That's good work today.</i>

1067

1068
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:29,207
from the law enforcement
professional of the year.

1069
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:32,811
What happens now,
boss?

1070
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,879
We go home,

1071
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:38,182
come back to work again
tomorrow.

1072
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:44,655
We're not gonna
let you down.

1073
