1
00:00:01,998 --> 00:00:04,332
I vow to be true, always.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,368
I vow to always be yours.

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:07,668
Yeah!

4
00:00:07,736 --> 00:00:09,169
<i>Previously on "flashpoint":</i>

5
00:00:09,237 --> 00:00:10,137
<i>Team, we're
looking at another bomb</i>

6
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:11,806
<i>that just went off downtown.</i>

7
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:14,041
We're looking at terror.

8
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,042
Steve!

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,878
- Ed!
- Where is he?

10
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:19,445
<i>Phone signal's here,
man, it's gotta be him.</i>

11
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:21,015
Clark! Clark!

12
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,083
Donna, if there's no timer
on the bomb,

13
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:24,784
then you can wait
till I get there!

14
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,119
No, I can handle it.

15
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:27,387
<i>How many wires do you see?</i>

16
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:29,222
Uh...

17
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:30,557
Eighteen.

18
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,992
<i>Donna, how's our subject?</i>

19
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,160
Quiet, co-operative -
could be the gun on his head.

20
00:00:34,228 --> 00:00:35,662
Boss, this make
any sense to you?

21
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,696
If he was gonna blow
himself up,

22
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:38,097
<i>why didn't he already do it?</i>

23
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:40,699
This is your very last chance.

24
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,903
Tell me where the detonator is
right now!

25
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,004
Right now!

26
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,574
What're you looking at?

27
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:51,544
What do you see, Donna?

28
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:53,579
I got a blinking camera
in the ceiling.

29
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:56,614
Get outta there now!

30
00:00:58,116 --> 00:00:59,283
Donna, what's happening?

31
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,052
Eddie...

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,420
Move!

33
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:10,161
Boss!

34
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:16,332
Boss!

35
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,535
I'm okay.

36
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,811
Holt wasn't the bomber,
he was the bait, Eddie.

37
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:32,448
She's gone, Eddie.

38
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:36,652
<i>She was right in front of him.</i>

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,557
Sonofabitch!

40
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:44,158
Sonofabitch!

41
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:53,902
Clark! Clark!

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,937
Steve, get in here!

43
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:57,472
<i>Get the oxygen mask in there!</i>

44
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,440
<i>Clark!</i>

45
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:00,874
Clark!
Let's clear the door!

46
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:02,142
<i>Let's clear it!</i>

47
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:15,655
Pull up! Get in there!

48
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,759
<i>Clark, I'm here.</i>

49
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:21,527
<i>You're gonna be okay, buddy,</i>
<i>I'm right here.</i>

50
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:25,064
<i>Okay, you're gonna be okay.</i>

51
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:29,102
Clark?

52
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,944
Okay, let's get a board!

53
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,746
<i>I need a board!</i>

54
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:43,749
Okay, let's get that board!
Let's get that board down here!

55
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:46,184
<i>Okay, I'm right with you.</i>

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,886
<i>Okay, okay.</i>
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

57
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:50,054
What...
What happened?

58
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:51,421
You're okay, you're okay.

59
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:52,657
We're gonna take care of you,
all right?

60
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:53,724
They got him!

61
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:54,859
<i>Guys, I got him.</i>

62
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,326
<i>We're good.</i>
<i>We're good here.</i>

63
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:57,828
That's great. You
stay with him, Eddie.

64
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:01,165
You gotta stay back.

65
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,366
My people need to see
if the structure

66
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,669
of the building's compromised
first.

67
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,537
All right.
Okay?

68
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:11,340
Oh God...

69
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:16,245
Hey! I need your cruiser,
there's another bomb.

70
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,530
Hey, I told
you to stay outside!

71
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:37,732
There's nothing you can do
to help here.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,167
Look, my people
are still in there.

73
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:41,569
I'm sorry. It
was over in a second.

74
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,108
Supporting wall is compromised.

75
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:48,442
<i>It's not safe.</i>

76
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,610
<i>I'll show you another way in.</i>

77
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,678
<i>All right, boys, let's go!</i>

78
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,181
<i>Got it. Yeah.</i>

79
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:56,116
<i>Okay, easy.</i>
<i>We got you.</i>

80
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:58,051
<i>We got you, okay.</i>

81
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,020
- Easy, easy.
- Easy, guys.

82
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:06,827
Hey. He's gonna be okay.
He's getting an IV started,

83
00:04:06,894 --> 00:04:08,660
<i>and, you know, he's okay,</i>
<i>he's conscious.</i>

84
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,930
Tell me everything,
don't leave anything out.

85
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,398
<i>Soph, he's got a broken
leg, a broken wrist.</i>

86
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:14,700
I think he's got
some broken ribs.

87
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:15,567
<i>I'm telling you</i>
<i>everything I know.</i>

88
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:17,136
Is he okay?

89
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:18,337
<i>Where are you taking him?</i>
<i>I'll meet you there!</i>

90
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:19,772
No, no.
Soph, stay at home with Izzie.

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,173
Just stay safe.
It's not over, okay?

92
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,908
I'm gonna take him
to the hospital,

93
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,308
<i>we're gonna get him x-rayed,</i>
<i>we're gonna check him out.</i>

94
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:25,877
Everything's gonna be fine.

95
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:27,478
<i>Just tell him
I love him, okay?</i>

96
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:29,413
- Ed, we're ready to move.
- Okay, Soph, I gotta go.

97
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,983
Eddie,
please, be careful.

98
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,619
I will, okay? I love you.
Bye.

99
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:39,423
We have to get
out of here right now,

100
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:40,657
it's not safe!

101
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:42,392
<i>Everyone out, now!</i>

102
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,229
We have to set a new perimeter.

103
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:01,210
We got a problem -
a big problem.

104
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:04,413
I got really high readings
in there.

105
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:06,849
Team one, new deal.

106
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,785
Okay.

107
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,820
Let's get you fixed up.
You ready to ride?

108
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:13,755
- I'm gonna be okay?
- You're gonna be fine.

109
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,657
You gotta go, dad.

110
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:18,193
I'm not going anywhere.

111
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:21,029
No, dad, please!
You gotta get this guy.

112
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:22,664
Ed, coming or going?

113
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:24,800
No, hang on, hang on.
Buddy, I'm not going...

114
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,301
<i>Dad, no, okay?</i>

115
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,903
You gotta do this!
I'm gonna be fine. Please?

116
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,370
Are you sure?

117
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,139
Yes.

118
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,175
Okay. Okay,
I'll see you at home.

119
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,077
I love you.
Your mom and I love you.

120
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:38,412
I love you too.

121
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:52,058
Team one, I'm coming to you.

122
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:05,938
What's happening?

123
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,239
We're not allowed
to cross the perimeter.

124
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:11,343
Boss, what's going on?

125
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,012
<i>Team, just hang tight.</i>

126
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,413
Boss!

127
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:17,949
No, don't! Don't!
Stay back!

128
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,683
Why? What's going on?

129
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:21,485
Exposed to radiation.

130
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:24,588
It was a dirty bomb.

131
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:42,906
All right, guys,
you know the drill.

132
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:44,341
I've gotta go offline,
get scrubbed,

133
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:45,508
<i>get blood tests.</i>

134
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:48,344
<i>I need you to stay on task.</i>

135
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,045
Do you copy?

136
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:51,847
Copy that, boss.

137
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,549
Now, someone dropped
a trail of breadcrumbs

138
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:57,853
leading us right here,
leading us to the wrong man.

139
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:00,356
He watched as this man died.

140
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:02,291
<i>Someone hated Anson Holt</i>
<i>personally.</i>

141
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:05,126
Holt was a sadist;
Sadists have victims.

142
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,461
And he was arrested
for abusive experiments...

143
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,698
- Officer!
- I'm not done yet!

144
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,633
They were performed right here.

145
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:13,868
The manifesto said
it began here;

146
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:17,138
we're looking for
one of his students.

147
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,311
What just happened?

148
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,913
- He just signed off.
-  Why?

149
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,180
His headset's contaminated.

150
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,982
He's gotta get himself
cleaned up.

151
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,718
We can't just drop contact.

152
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:32,819
You're right.

153
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,626
Okay, guys, let's do this!

154
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,995
Sam, coordinate
with the military.

155
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,931
We need more boots
on the ground now!

00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,268
<i>Okay, outer layers off.</i>

159
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,069
Equipment, cell phones,
gloves...

160
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,539
Anything that's exposed
stays here.

161
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,976
The material released
by the device is Caesium 137.

162
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,978
You're gonna be taking one gram
<i>of Prussian Blue.</i>

163
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,413
It binds to the Caesium,

164
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,348
moves it faster through
your digestive system.

165
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,984
I'm gonna be sick.

166
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:15,185
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

167
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,286
Here.

168
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,627
What's your name, son?

169
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,931
Jason. Do you know how
dirty bombs work, Jason?

170
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:28,899
They spray radioactive
material,

171
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,533
contaminate the area.

172
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,903
They spread fear;
That's the bomber's point.

173
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:36,573
The good news is,
fear is easy to treat.

174
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,375
A dose of facts
usually gets you results.

175
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:40,877
How long were you in there?

176
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:42,479
Not too long.

177
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,147
<i>Okay, demron blankets.</i>

178
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,582
You wrap them tight
around your body.

179
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:50,085
But we were already exposed.

180
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:51,453
It's all right,

181
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,121
it protects others
from exposure to us.

182
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,624
It's just a precaution.

183
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,195
So this was hidden
at the prof's house.

184
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:01,662
It looks like Holt kept
the video archives

185
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,330
of his experiment.

186
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:06,033
Subjects...
Eight students.

187
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:08,803
Okay, it's a start.
Get these names to Winnie.

188
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:10,270
Firewalled.

189
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:11,405
<i>The video server</i>
<i>he was using in there,</i>

190
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:12,807
I can't trace it,
I can't trace the IP.

191
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,274
I have no idea where
he was watching this from.

192
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:16,043
Yeah?
Go ahead, Winnie.

193
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,677
Colonel, wind's
10k South, southeast.

194
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,045
That means from here
to the lake,

195
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:20,647
we've gotta keep everyone
inside their houses.

196
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,015
Windows shut, vents sealed.

197
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:24,584
Duct tape, plastic,
whatever's available.

198
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:26,920
We're upwind on the north side.
You can stage here.

199
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:28,955
Anything comes in contact
with the ash or the debris,

200
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:32,225
seal it in a plastic bag,
shower off immediately!

201
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,026
<i>Guys, we can cross
"big banking" off the list;</i>

202
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,896
team two just defused a bomb
at the Hudson Trust head office.

203
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:38,764
Okay, okay, good news.

204
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:39,865
Team one, the
bomber's just called 911

205
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,233
and boss is offline.

206
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,802
Copy that, Winnie.
Jules, you take this.

207
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,905
Okay, Winnie,
patch me through.

208
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,107
This is Jules Callaghan

209
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:50,909
with the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

210
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,243
<i>Where's my other puppet?</i>

211
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,678
<i>He's in the field right now.</i>

212
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,379
You got what you wanted;
The manifesto's out there.

213
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,314
You're gonna be famous.

214
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:58,716
<i>You want to tell us</i>
<i>what your name is?</i>

215
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,484
Why would I
make it that easy?

216
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:01,786
That's right, the last
time you made it that easy,

217
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:03,621
we walked right into it.

218
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,222
<i>You sent the manifesto</i>
<i>from a smartphone</i>

219
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,190
<i>spoofed to Anson Holt's name.</i>

220
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:08,792
Very good.

221
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,627
Then pointed us
straight here to the lab.

222
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,596
And Holt walked
right into it, too.

223
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,164
<i>And then you
strapped a bomb on him,</i>

224
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,499
made him watch the news,

225
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,435
made him watch what you'd done.

226
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:23,606
While I watched him sit
there too scared to even breathe!

227
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,609
You've proven your point.

228
00:11:26,677 --> 00:11:28,578
I think the five remaining bombs
are redundant.

229
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:32,814
How'd you
know there were five?

230
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,085
Where are they?

231
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:37,919
<i>You think people know fear yet?</i>

232
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,153
This is nothing.

233
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:41,923
This isn't fear,
this is an inconvenience.

234
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:44,158
People still have illusions
someone's looking out for them.

235
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,928
<i>Police, paramedics,</i>
<i>government, doctors...</i>

236
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:48,329
Authority figures.

237
00:11:48,397 --> 00:11:49,464
<i>You think you can trust them?</i>

238
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:51,032
<i>It's all lies, it's smoke,</i>

239
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,433
<i>and when people</i>
<i>understand that,</i>

240
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,501
when they realize
no one's looking out for you...

241
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:55,703
Then they'll know fear.

242
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,437
<i>Then they'll grow up.</i>

243
00:11:57,505 --> 00:11:59,372
Five down, five to go.

244
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:04,712
Confirming a
total of ten bombs,

245
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,546
but still no closer
to who this guy is.

246
00:12:06,615 --> 00:12:07,715
<i>Maybe a little closer.</i>

247
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:09,483
Those eight participants
in Holt's study,

248
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,383
how many of them
know how to set up a firewall?

249
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:13,385
We're looking for the one
with the most security measures.

250
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:14,386
But four of the subject's
students

251
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:15,788
have moved to other cities.

252
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:16,823
<i>Four of them are still local,</i>

253
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,724
three of them have open IP's,

254
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,325
no security.

255
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:21,360
Leaving one
Marcus Faber.

256
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:22,829
Winnie, we need an address!

257
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:28,366
<i>Marcus Faber,
266 Robinson Street.</i>

258
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,235
<i>Twenty-five years old,</i>
<i>parents deceased.</i>

259
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:31,903
<i>He dropped out</i>
<i>of Brookfield University,</i>

260
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:34,039
<i>but before that he actually</i>
<i>attended schools for the gifted</i>

261
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:35,040
as a child.

262
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:36,541
<i>He skipped grades twice.</i>

263
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:37,776
Well, any trouble with the law?

264
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:38,944
Six months in jail for assault,

265
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:40,378
charges for vagrancy,
that's it.

266
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:42,180
Does he work?

267
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:44,516
Uh... no tax records
filed, so nothing on the books.

268
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,684
Here, he took a job
three months ago

269
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,520
as a telephone technician.

270
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:50,255
That lines up with
the bomb's wiring!

271
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:51,756
And he would've had the access
to plant them.

272
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:53,358
This has gotta be our guy.

273
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,015
Thank you.

274
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,100
Sergeant Parker!

275
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,102
This came from SRU.

276
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,670
Thank you.

277
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,274
Oh, thank you, Winnie!

278
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,915
Thank you, son.

279
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,032
Let's go, guys, hard and fast.

280
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,901
<i>Let's move!</i>
<i>Let's move now!</i>

281
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:16,103
Go, go, go, go, go!

282
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:19,772
Police! Police!
Get down!

283
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,041
Police! Police!

284
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,042
<i>Clear!</i>

285
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,143
Clear!

286
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:28,214
Okay, team,
let's tear this place apart!

287
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:35,353
<i>We've gotta get ahead</i>
<i>of him here...</i>

288
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
<i>Equipment, plans, anything!</i>

289
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:45,696
<i>Right here! We've
got a map on the wall!</i>

290
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:47,165
<i>Has he marked the targets?</i>

291
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:48,900
<i>- Negative!</i>
<i>- Keep looking!</i>

292
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:12,288
What's this?

293
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:19,027
Spike, bomb components!

294
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:23,799
Yep.

295
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,769
Caesium 137.
Same stuff Hazmat found.

296
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:29,904
Trace amounts...

297
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,038
It's not dangerous
at this level.

298
00:15:31,106 --> 00:15:33,473
H8, K6, G11.

299
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,513
Some kind of code?

300
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,048
Is that some kind of datasheet?

301
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,385
This is old school.
These are the targets.

302
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:47,620
Map coordinates.

303
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:49,923
The 911 call centre.

304
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,958
H8, Brookfield University.

305
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:54,861
<i>We got the Federal Building,</i>
<i>City Hall.</i>

306
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,297
K6, Hudson Trust,
that was team two's package.

307
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,332
<i>Okay, team, I'm here, I
heard the last part of that.</i>

308
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,599
<i>We've got the five
remaining targets,</i>

309
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,835
and the subject
is Marcus Faber.

310
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:05,670
G11, police station
on College Street!

311
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:08,473
EMS headquarters, and
there's a TV station.

312
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,407
<i>Okay, what about a timeline?</i>

313
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:10,742
He's on a half-hour schedule.

314
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,777
The lab was the last one to go,
which one's next?

315
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,047
<i>There's no indication.</i>

316
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:16,248
All right, team, I'm scrubbed.

317
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:17,349
I'm not waiting
for my blood test.

318
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,183
You've got too much
ground to cover.

319
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:20,551
<i>Greg, you wait until
the blood work gets back,</i>

320
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:22,586
<i>you hear me?</i>
<i>We got this.</i>

321
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:23,988
Okay.

322
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:25,256
All right, Jules,

323
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:26,423
let's get inside
this guy's head, then.

324
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,025
We've got video
on Holt's experiment.

325
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,093
Marcus was one of his students.

326
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:30,828
<i>I'm gonna stream it to you.</i>

327
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,796
It's gonna take a minute though
'cause there's a lot to upload.

328
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:34,297
Copy that.

329
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:36,699
And another student,
Tony James, lives close by.

330
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:39,069
I'm gonna go talk to him,
get his take on Marcus.

331
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:40,436
Okay now, the rest of us,

332
00:16:40,504 --> 00:16:41,804
we're gonna split into
rapid intervention teams:

333
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:43,940
<i>One SRU, one EMS,</i>
<i>one firefighter.</i>

334
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,275
Each team takes a target,

335
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:46,609
<i>we find the bomb, we defuse it.</i>

336
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:48,278
Spike's gonna talk us through
the tech.

337
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:49,346
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute!

338
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:50,712
We're short one bomb.

339
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,914
What do you mean, Spike?

340
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:52,982
<i>Ten targets.</i>

341
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:53,983
He's written down
nine locations.

342
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,517
We're missing one.

343
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:56,685
Where's the last bomb?

344
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:06,512
Guys, we need you
outta here now!

345
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,880
Copy that.

346
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:08,915
Radiation level?

347
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:10,716
Uh, clean so far.

348
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:12,885
Okay, the floorplans have
the server on the second floor.

349
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:14,220
Are we good?

350
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:15,186
Yeah, it's all good.
Let's get it done.

351
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:16,254
Team one, status?

352
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:20,491
Bravo team at the emergency
medical services building.

353
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:24,529
Charlie team
at Adelaide Systems.

354
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,566
<i>Delta team, we're
at the TV station.</i>

355
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,601
<i>- Team...</i>
<i>- Boss?</i>

356
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:32,670
I know this is hard.
We're split up,

357
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:34,505
<i>we don't know</i>
<i>what we're walking into.</i>

358
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:37,542
<i>But today's like any day;</i>
<i>We walk through doors together,</i>

359
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,876
<i>we're in each other's ears,</i>

360
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:40,411
<i>and we've got</i>
<i>each other covered.</i>

361
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,613
<i>And even though</i>
<i>I'm not there with you,</i>

362
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:44,582
my hand is on your backs,

363
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,883
<i>and don't forget that.</i>

364
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,217
It works both ways, Greg.

365
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,722
Negative for radiation.
We're good.

366
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,492
Okay. Clear out, guys,
only one man downrange.

367
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,297
Spike, I got a picture,
it's coming to you.

368
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:38,932
Okay, silver lining,

369
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,468
our bomber's
a creature of habit.

370
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:45,506
It's the same device
he used at the call centre.

371
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:55,280
<i>Okay, guys, radiation levels?</i>

372
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,451
Negative for bravo.

373
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:03,088
Negative for Charlie.

374
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,673
Okay, guys, I'm the only one
that needs to be here.

375
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,360
Okay, timers!

376
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:11,295
Mine's a little over
thirty-five minutes.

377
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:13,064
<i>Ed, what do you got?</i>

378
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:15,066
I got fourteen minutes.

379
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,735
Twenty-three and change.

380
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,904
He's picking up the pace.

381
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,641
<i>Guys, it looks like
I got the short straw.</i>

382
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,974
<i>Five minutes</i>
<i>and thirty seconds.</i>

383
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,242
Okay, guys, I need you
to get outta here now,

384
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:27,545
<i>make sure</i>
<i>this building's clear!</i>

385
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:30,881
Five minutes...
What the hell am I doing here?

386
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:32,816
Okay, Spike,
just focus on Sam, okay?

387
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:34,317
Spike, we're gonna
follow along.

388
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:35,485
Just focus on Sam.

389
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,755
Yeah.

390
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,523
Spike, what happened to Lou...

391
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,724
<i>was a sacrifice he chose.</i>

392
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,526
It's the reason
you're still with us.

393
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:44,661
<i>But that's not going</i>
<i>to happen today,</i>

394
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:46,395
<i>you know that, right?</i>

395
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,264
Yeah, I know that, boss.

396
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:49,465
<i>Okay.</i>

397
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,935
Okay, Spike, what do we do?

398
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:54,884
All right, Sam, guys,

399
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:56,672
take out your meters,

400
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:58,373
and I want you to check
the resistance, okay?

401
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,075
Then I need you to take out
your tac knives.

402
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:06,048
Marcus was a
couple of years younger.

403
00:20:06,115 --> 00:20:09,952
He was gifted,
and, I don't know, different.

404
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:11,486
How?

405
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:13,754
Awkward, vulnerable.

406
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:17,324
You met him through
Anson Holt's study?

407
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,326
We were all honoured
to be chosen.

408
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:20,661
<i>I mean, there were fistfights</i>

409
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:22,196
<i>just to get into</i>
<i>this guy's seminars.</i>

410
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,731
What'd you do when you realized

411
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,332
that the study was a bit more
than you bargained for?

412
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,934
<i>He told us, "what
happens in the lab,</i>

413
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,702
<i>stays in the lab,"</i>

414
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,471
<i>and we did what he said.</i>

415
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:33,473
I mean, this is Anson Holt.

416
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,059
He made us tell him
what we loved,

417
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,446
what was precious,

418
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:43,016
<i>what gave us hope,</i>

419
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:44,016
what we...

420
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,383
<i>Eyes up!</i>

421
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:49,354
What our secrets were,
what we believed in.

422
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,990
He took it in.

423
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:54,660
Each of us had to sit
in the "hot seat"...

424
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:56,996
<i>Eyes up! Keep your
eyes on the monitor!</i>

425
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,363
Camera in our face,

426
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:01,933
with all the other
students watching,

427
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:04,235
while he tore us apart.

428
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,239
And then Holt started
giving us medication.

429
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:12,242
We never knew
if it was real or placebo.

430
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:15,211
He made us watch these DVDs.

431
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,047
<i>- Eyes up!</i>
<i>- Torture...</i>

432
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:18,181
<i>Keep your eyes focused!</i>

433
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:20,150
Snuff films.
It was...

434
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:21,084
<i>Look up!</i>

435
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:22,985
It was sickening.

436
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:26,455
<i>Tony, I need
you to stay focused.</i>

437
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:29,629
<i>Tony, stay focused!</i>

438
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:31,226
Tony!

439
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:32,294
<i>I can't!</i>

440
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:34,764
Keep your eyes on the monitors!

441
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:36,098
<i>He's just a little kid!</i>

442
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,800
- He's what?!
- He's a little boy!

443
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:40,501
He is what?!

444
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:42,270
<i>A victim! He's a victim!</i>

445
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,772
That's right, Tony.

446
00:21:44,707 --> 00:21:46,174
He's a victim.

447
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,877
He made us watch
them again, and again,

448
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:52,047
'til you keep seeing them
all day, and all night,

449
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:54,482
and I couldn't stand it!

450
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:58,319
They found my
son in his residence.

451
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:00,555
He'd taken a bottle
of sleeping pills.

452
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:02,856
I brought him home,
I finally got him to talk.

453
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:04,692
I talked to a lawyer,
I called other parents.

454
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,994
I tried to get a lawsuit going.

455
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:09,564
I didn't see any records
of charges being laid.

456
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:12,965
The university came back
with a huge settlement offer

457
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,601
on condition of silence.

458
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,736
I just wanted
it all to be over.

459
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:17,904
Thank you, Tony.

460
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:26,979
My name is Marcus Faber,
I'm nineteen years old.

461
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,980
<i>Well, I'm eighteen.</i>

462
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,382
Nineteen in May.

463
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,318
<i>Tell me, Marcus...</i>

464
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:34,353
<i>what do you love?</i>

465
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,695
<i>Who do you think</i>
<i>can protect you?</i>

466
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,996
This is fear, Marcus.

467
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,066
<i>It owns you now.</i>

468
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,870
You're just another victim,

469
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,641
and you know what happens
to victims, don't you?

470
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,209
<i>Victims get what
they've got coming!</i>

471
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,009
- Sergeant Parker?
- Yeah.

472
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:01,778
We've got the results
of your blood work.

473
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:04,281
You're gonna wanna follow up,
but you're a lucky man.

474
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,349
You're good to go.

475
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,050
Oh, thank you!

476
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,086
Okay, team, how we doing?

477
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:12,256
Okay, careful now,
carefully put the dry ice in

478
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:13,323
with the acetone.

479
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,958
<i>Sam, how're you doing?</i>

480
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:15,858
<i>I'm still trying
to expose the switch.</i>

481
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:17,360
I'm going as fast as I can.

482
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:18,561
<i>You go as
careful as you can.</i>

483
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:19,762
Right.
Fast and careful.

484
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:22,831
- And safe.
- I know, Spike!

485
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:31,173
I'm cooling it down now.
I'm under ninety seconds.

486
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:32,540
Sam, you're running
out of time.

487
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,376
<i>You need to get outta there,</i>
<i>buddy.</i>

488
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:36,177
Building's not clear.

489
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:37,512
Okay, Sam, you're not gonna
have enough time to do this.

490
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,080
You need to get outta there
right now.

491
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:41,316
Team, you just
stay focused on your task.

492
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:42,684
<i>Hey, boss, I
talked to Tony James.</i>

493
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:43,851
These kids were young, bright,

494
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,487
eager to please,
trusted authority.

495
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,221
He used that authority
to break 'em down.

496
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:48,555
Jules, Jules, wait.

497
00:23:48,623 --> 00:23:49,690
<i>Winnie sent me the files.</i>

498
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:51,258
They all took
the settlement money.

499
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:52,259
<i>Four of 'em left town,</i>
<i>two of 'em are in drug rehab,</i>

500
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:53,627
<i>and one's in jail.</i>

501
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:55,296
You either lash out
or you self-destruct.

502
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:56,397
<i>Jules, just
stop, all right?</i>

503
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:57,898
<i>Just go to channel one.</i>

504
00:23:57,965 --> 00:23:58,965
It's Sam.

505
00:24:01,102 --> 00:24:02,536
Sam, what's going on?

506
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:03,636
I've got time.

507
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:05,204
Sam, no, you do not!

508
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:06,572
Sam, do you need
to get outta there?

509
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,441
It's working, I've got this.

510
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:09,676
Sam!

511
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:10,810
It's working;
Temperature's going down.

512
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:12,312
It's minus thirty-five degrees.

513
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:14,880
Sam, you drop your tools
right now,

514
00:24:14,948 --> 00:24:17,116
and you get yourself outta there
right now!

515
00:24:17,184 --> 00:24:18,384
Come on...

516
00:24:18,452 --> 00:24:19,285
<i>Sam, listen to him!</i>

517
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,419
Minus thirty-eight degrees!

518
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,220
Sam, you listen to him!

519
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:23,722
It's almost there!

520
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,224
Sam, we will not
lose each other today!

521
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:27,125
Sam?
Sam, get out!

522
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:28,293
<i>Go!</i>

523
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:29,260
Go! Go! Go!

524
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:31,963
Sam, get out of there now!

525
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:34,132
<i>Get out, Sam!</i>

526
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,266
Sam!

527
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,678
Sam!

528
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,516
Sam, talk to me.

529
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:55,652
<i>Sam, talk to me!</i>

530
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,222
Okay, team...

531
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,324
team, I need you to hear me
right now.

532
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:02,792
I need you to keep safe.

533
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,794
<i>Spike? Spike!</i>

534
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,363
You listen to me, all right?

535
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,030
<i>We still need you, we all do,</i>

536
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:11,467
and whatever happened,
you need to keep going.

537
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:13,301
You hear me?
You keep going!

538
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,302
<i>You all do!</i>

539
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:15,404
Okay.

540
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:38,459
What the boss said, guys.
Trust me,

541
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:39,660
you don't wanna do this
the hard way.

542
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:50,337
Sam Braddock, you do not
do that to me again.

543
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:52,572
Okay, Sam, get yourself
cleaned up, all right?

544
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,408
That's the last bomb
he's gonna blow up today!

545
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:55,975
Okay, guys, let's do this!

546
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:57,610
<i>Okay, Spike,
temperature's dropping.</i>

547
00:25:57,677 --> 00:26:00,280
Thirty-eight,
thirty-eight five,

548
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:01,948
thirty-nine.

549
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,049
<i>Okay, Ed, that
should be frozen solid.</i>

550
00:26:03,117 --> 00:26:04,250
Spike, "should be?"

551
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:05,751
No, it is, it is.
It's frozen solid.

552
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,087
Just lift the circuit board,
cut the blue wire.

553
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:13,892
Okay...

554
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:20,432
Boss, the bomb is defused.
I'm on my way.

555
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,735
Spike, I just froze
the tilt switch.

556
00:26:23,803 --> 00:26:25,537
Copy that, Leah.
Same thing I told Ed.

557
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:27,939
Lift the circuit board,
cut the blue wire.

558
00:26:36,481 --> 00:26:38,482
Clear!

559
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,984
<i>Nice, Leah!</i>

560
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:41,618
<i>I'm on my way
to the stadium.</i>

561
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:42,920
Okay, Jules,

562
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:44,654
let's just cut to the chase,
all right?

563
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:45,721
<i>We gotta find that last bomb.</i>

564
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:47,057
<i>Let's nail who this guy is.</i>

565
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:48,191
Yeah, I'm getting
mixed messages.

566
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:49,359
<i>I'm with you.</i>

567
00:26:49,427 --> 00:26:50,827
The manifesto's all about
fighting back

568
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,329
against forces of control,

569
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:54,797
like he's on some twisted
mission to help people...

570
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,266
<i>Free them from government,</i>
<i>or whatever.</i>

571
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:57,334
Yeah, but if you're gonna
help people,

572
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:58,868
you don't kill their children.

573
00:26:58,936 --> 00:27:00,302
<i>This is about Marcus</i>
<i>being in control.</i>

574
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,837
He doesn't wanna feel
like a victim anymore,

575
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,306
<i>so he shows Holt,</i>
<i>beats him at his own game.</i>

576
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,175
Shows the world
he's in control,

577
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:07,576
he's the boss.

578
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,711
This is about Marcus
being in control.

579
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,080
All right, I'm Marcus.

580
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,015
I'm gonna reduce my world
to black and white.

581
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,851
The strong and the weak.

582
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:25,426
Jules, I think I know
where the last bomb is.

583
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,965
I think it's right here.

584
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,644
The bomb's right there
in the stadium?

585
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:39,755
How can you be sure?

586
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,514
I'm not, but wouldn't it explain

587
00:27:41,582 --> 00:27:43,447
why Marcus didn't have
the location of the last bomb?

588
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:45,417
Yes, and he wouldn't
have known it himself

589
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:46,785
until about an hour ago,

590
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:48,454
when they mentioned the triage
on the news.

591
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:50,188
Jules, a lot of these people
can't be moved easily.

592
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,624
It's gonna take a lot more time
<i>than we might have.</i>

593
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:55,828
Best chance is finding
that bomb,

594
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:57,729
and defusing it.

595
00:27:57,797 --> 00:27:58,797
<i>Okay, boss, if this
is a last-minute target,</i>

596
00:27:58,865 --> 00:27:59,798
he still could be there.

597
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,031
You watch yourself!

598
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:02,733
Okay, just send me a photo.

599
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:04,936
Now, listen, I don't
think talk is an option, okay?

600
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:06,504
He's not gonna wanna be
psychologized,

601
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:08,238
<i>especially by a guy in uniform.</i>

602
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:10,140
<i>You are everything</i>
<i>that he hates.</i>

603
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,576
Yeah, copy that.

604
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:16,380
Hey, I want you to meet me
over there.

605
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:19,148
Okay, boss, we'll get a
kit sent to you right away.

606
00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:21,685
Meantime, your tac knife
is your best friend.

607
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:23,553
See if you can get an ohm meter
from a stadium tech.

608
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:31,761
This is the bomber,
his name is Marcus Faber.

609
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:33,228
Keep your weapons ready.

610
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:35,498
We're looking for packages,
wires, suitcases.

611
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:38,066
Check stairwells,
garbage cans, vents.

612
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,302
It could be anything, anywhere.

613
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,470
All right?

614
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:43,372
Communications
on channel three.

615
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,940
Good luck.

616
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:46,375
<i>Greg, if you're Marcus,</i>

617
00:28:46,442 --> 00:28:48,276
you want maximum damage
from a single bomb, right?

618
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:49,811
Yeah, right.

619
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,513
He knows that bomb will not
take that stadium down,

620
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,515
<i>and this is his grand finale.</i>

621
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:56,417
Yeah. It's gonna be dirty.

622
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,687
Greg, he's gonna put that bomb
up somewhere high,

623
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:01,055
<i>somewhere where everyone</i>
<i>in that stadium</i>

624
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:02,356
<i>will be exposed.</i>

625
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,392
And the city outside, Eddie.

626
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:05,993
I'll keep you posted.

627
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:21,173
It's taking way too long.

628
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:22,975
Boss, Jules and
I are on the scene.

629
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:24,510
<i>Evac's a mess here.</i>

630
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,744
I've found the bomb,
top level, catwalk.

631
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,379
You were right, Eddie.

632
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:03,914
<i>- I'm on my way up.</i>
<i>- Negative, negative.</i>

633
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:05,616
Ed,
this one's definitely dirty.

634
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:07,250
I you need to clear
everyone away

635
00:30:07,318 --> 00:30:09,085
<i>and get everyone out of range.</i>

636
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,352
Boss, are you sure?

637
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:14,724
Spike, CS 137.
I'm sending you a photo.

638
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:18,360
<i>Boss, my bomb is defused,
I can be there in minutes.</i>

639
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:20,396
Up high, maximum damage.

640
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:27,035
Caesium 137,
right next to the C4.

641
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:30,772
I've got access to a timer -
three minutes, forty seconds.

642
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,708
Officer, let's move
these people back!

643
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:33,809
Clear room for vehicles.

644
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,376
Copy that.

645
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:37,045
We need to get the
most critical out now!

646
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:49,356
Can you locate
the power supply?

647
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:52,442
Not that I can see.

648
00:30:52,562 --> 00:30:54,662
<i>Okay, it's gonna be underneath
just like all the other ones.</i>

649
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,896
What about the detonator,
is that exposed?

650
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:57,497
Not that I can see, Spike.

651
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,898
That's 'cause he's got
it in the middle of the C4.

652
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:00,333
<i>Okay, boss,</i>
<i>the first thing we gotta do,</i>

653
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,835
we gotta make sure...
The anti-handling devices...

654
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,637
We gotta find those first,
okay?

655
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,038
So I want you to check
for leads.

656
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:06,740
<i>Do you see any leads</i>
<i>going into the circuit?</i>

657
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:08,241
Yeah, stand by.

658
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:09,809
Yes! Okay, perfect.
Get the ohm meter

659
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:11,011
and I want you to check
that circuit.

660
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:22,287
Winnie, we need every
available vehicle down here now!

661
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,458
<i>Get the door!</i>

662
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,850
Ohm meter's holding steady
at nine.

663
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:55,285
It means there's no
resistance in the circuit.

664
00:31:55,352 --> 00:31:56,653
Yeah, is that a good thing?

665
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:58,021
<i>That's a great thing, boss.</i>

666
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:59,156
<i>It means there's</i>
<i>no anti-handling devices.</i>

667
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:00,190
There's a clear path
to the detonator

668
00:32:00,257 --> 00:32:01,757
<i>and the power supply.</i>

669
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:03,392
He must've ran out of time
on this bomb or something.

670
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,394
Step by step,
what do I do next?

671
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:09,965
- Boss?
- Boss!

672
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,167
I'm taking fire.
He's here, it's him!

673
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,605
- Sam!
- Right behind you!

674
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:28,249
Okay, Spike, what do I do?
What do I do?

675
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:31,753
Get away from the bomb!

676
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:33,553
Boss, are you there?

677
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:36,824
<i>Boss, you there?</i>

678
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,360
Yeah,
just took it in the vest.

679
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,234
<i>Spike, what do I do next?</i>

680
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,235
Just lift the cover, boss!
Just lift the cover

681
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,703
<i>and get underneath</i>
<i>to the power source.</i>

682
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:51,871
Okay, Spike.

683
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:54,306
Oh! Agh!

684
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:10,289
Marcus?
Marcus, listen to me.

685
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,124
<i>I know I'm not gonna try</i>
<i>to talk you down,</i>

686
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,659
and I'm not gonna try
to talk you down

687
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:16,428
because I know you don't care.

688
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,731
<i>Oh, you tried to hurt</i>
<i>those around me.</i>

689
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,133
<i>You killed kids,</i>
<i>you killed people I love,</i>

690
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,302
<i>and I know you don't feel</i>
<i>any fear anymore</i>

691
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,905
because your message
is already out there.

692
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,577
That feels good, doesn't it?

693
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:34,879
Your will, your messages...

694
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,214
Will live on.

695
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,049
Mission accomplished.

696
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,856
Sever the wire!

697
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,091
<i>Cut the wire</i>

699
00:34:03,873 --> 00:34:07,510
<i>Sorry...</i>
<i>Sorry it didn't work out</i>

700
00:34:07,577 --> 00:34:10,278
because I just stopped
your bomb...

701
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:14,849
And my team stopped
your other bombs.

<i>Your message isn't going</i>

703
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:22,290
Your message is going nowhere.

704

You're done!

705
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:27,494
You're done!

706
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:36,970
You stay with me!

<i>Subject neutralized.</i>

708
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:40,073
Okay, okay, I got ya, I got ya.

709
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:41,407
We have an officer down!

710
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:42,308
<i>We need EMS</i>

711
00:34:42,376 --> 00:34:44,243
I repeat, officer down!

712
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:45,945
- You're gonna be okay.
- Where's the medic?!

713
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:48,381
We need a medic up here now!

714
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:51,551
You're gonna be okay, buddy.

715
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:54,286
<i>You stay with me, I got you.</i>
<i>I got you.</i>

716
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:56,222
Stay with us,
dad, we're here!

717
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:57,856
<i>Stay with us.</i>

718
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,510
You did it, buddy,
you defused the bomb.

719
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:04,580
Are you trying to put Spike
out of a job? Huh?

720
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:08,383
I got you...
I got you...

721
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:10,019
They're on their way.

722
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:12,722
We're gonna get you
out of this.

723
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:19,628
Hey, you remember
a couple years ago

724
00:35:19,695 --> 00:35:22,197
when I had to shoot
Goran Tomasic,

725
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:26,135
and you said to me, buddy,

726
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:29,337
"you might wanna do the math
on all the 'I'm fine's."

727
00:35:31,373 --> 00:35:33,608
I've never said thank you.

728
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:39,013
You're more than fine, buddy.

729
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,581
You're more than fine...

730
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:43,865
Stay with me.
No, you don't.

731
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:46,319
No, you don't!
Stay here!

732
00:35:46,387 --> 00:35:47,820
We're not done!

733
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:52,159
We're not done!

734
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:55,195
No you don't!
Greg, don't leave me.

735
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:56,963
You're not going anywhere!

736
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,399
Greg, stay here!
Stay here! You're staying here!

737
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:00,967
Medic!

738
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:02,726

Hey! What have I told you guys
about holding hands at the station.

753
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:22,737
We're off the clock boss.

754
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:23,937
Where's everybody?

755
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:25,226
They're just behind.

756
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,086
Ed... good speech.

757
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:30,610
Thank you.
He was a tough man.

758
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:33,363
<i>Sadie! Look who's here.</i>

759
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,816
Aunt Winnie and Uncle Spike.

760
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:37,513
She didn't fall asleep
in the car?

761
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,013
She didn't want
to miss any of the action.

762
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:41,501
She's all like "Where
am I going?

763
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:44,077
What kept you guys?

764
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:46,442
Greg, you forget the way
to the barn already?

765
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:48,732
Nice speech Ed.

766
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,250
Thank you.

767
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:52,756
Found out a lot about
this guy tonight.

768
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:55,967
Thank you buddy.  You said
some nice things tonight.

769
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:57,309
You're welcome.

770
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:00,409
Look, I hated to drag you outta
your retirement party early,

771
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,815
but I just thought that uh...

772
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:04,697
you know, it might be nice,
just us...

773
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:07,203
Last time as Team One.

774
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:08,446
Yep.

775
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:11,683
<i>Here, let me take her.</i>
<i>Come on, Sadie! Yes!</i>

776
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:13,475
<i>There we go!</i>

777
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,110
Oh, she's adorable!

778
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,235
<i>Let's go for a walk!</i>

779
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:25,599
Guys, to uh...

780
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,793
absent friends.

781
00:38:27,913 --> 00:38:29,036
Mm-hmm.

782
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:31,750
To Donna and Lou.

783
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,071
Donna and Lou.

784
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:38,634
To the new team leader
of Team Three!

785
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:41,544
Thank you.  And to the new
head instructor at the academy,

786
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,572
Bravely teaching
the next generation.

787
00:38:43,692 --> 00:38:44,982
<i>- Congratulations.</i>
<i>- Yup.</i>

788
00:38:45,102 --> 00:38:47,271
And to sergeant Ed Lane,

789
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,854
for taking team one forward.

790
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:51,025
Sarge.

791
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,248
Cheers!

792
00:38:56,871 --> 00:38:58,964
I miss it.

793
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:01,383
I miss it like hell.

794
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,333
I know you do.

795
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:09,761
But you're here Ed.

796
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:12,577
You're all here.

797
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:13,820
Yeah.

798
00:39:16,472 --> 00:39:18,630
<i></I> <i>And I've got my hand
on your backs,</i>

799
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,737
just like you've always had
your hands on mine.

800
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:30,146
Come on.

801
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:54,829
Team One.
