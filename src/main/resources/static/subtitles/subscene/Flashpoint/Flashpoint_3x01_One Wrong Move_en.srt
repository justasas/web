17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,040
man 1: this is sheila we're talking about?

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,800
the word "slack" is not in her vocabulary.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,410
man 2: he got any new words?

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,160

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,480
boss?

30
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:20,300

37
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,630
winnie: no, it's v.o.i.p., rerouted through an anonymous server.

38
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,750
future headquarters.it's a construction site.

39
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,800
okay, find out where globalmax is building.

40
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,480

65
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,390
winnie: sarge, priority call.

66
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,640
patch it through.

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,270
man: a bomb has been placed in the offices of a known environmental criminal

68
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,060
and it will detonate in one hour.

69
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,920
parker: priority one: we profile the subject.

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,200
locate the target, intercept it in time.

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,430
all right?spike?

72
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,050
spike: lou and i will check for a follow-up bomb.

73
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,220
if we're clear, we'll run diagnostics on the site.

74
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,740
see what we can learn from the bomber's materials.

75
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,290
boss, i had a look at a lot of i.e.d.'s in afghanistan.

76
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,340
parker: that's great, give 'em a hand.

77
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,670
ed: wordy, let's take the witnesses.

78
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,810
- wordy: got it.
- parker: jules, command truck.

79
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,330
let's get to know our friend.

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,040
what do you have, spike?

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,450
spike: okay, blast radius: 3.2 metr depth: 1.6 metres.

82
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,520
so, explosive force of about 3000 kilojoules.

83
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,290
that narrows it down.

84
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,790
what have we go on globalmax energy group?

85
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,370
jules: well, they patented a method of extracting crude from the tar sands.

86
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,430
effective, but environmentally toxic.

87
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,430
'kay, let's talk to csis, see who they've got on their eco-terror watch list.

88
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,790
- lewis: boss?
- parker: yeah, lou, go ahead.

89
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,680
ion scanner's identified the explosive.it's tnt.

90
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,790
can we trace it?

91
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,790
spike: yep, the residue, it has tracer elements embedded into it.

92
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,570
the lab can trace it right to the manufacturer,

93
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,680
right down to where the shipment was delivered...

94
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,760
okay, you had me at "yep." let's do it.

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,030
spike: copy that.

96
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,280
sam: spike, check this out.

97
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,180
we can trace this.

98
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,370
it has solder on it.

99
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,510
this batter set it off.we got a bar code.

100
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,030
sweet, sam.

101
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,300
nice.

102
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,190
eddie, any leads on a suspect?

103
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,360
we're working on it.

104
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,730
foreman: i can't believe they went this far.

105
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,380
these guys are a royal pain in the butt.

106
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,300
they're here every day like clockwork.

107
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,810
foreman: yesterday, things got out of control.

108
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,240
male protestor: globalmax murders the planet!we are not moving!

109
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,980

- hold on one minute, i'll get rid of 'em.

110
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,670
male protester: you are not getting through here!

111
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,660
call your boss, call your boss's boss, tell him we're not moving.

112
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,190
tell him he's accountable for murdering the planet!

113
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,990
you go call him, i gotta a job to do!

114
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,270
- get outta here!
- male protestor: no, we're not moving!

115
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,320
we are not moving!

116
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
foreman: all right, move it on.let's go, move it in.

117
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,300
you are not getting through here!

118
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,880
- you are not getting...
- foreman: i said move!i meant move!get outta here!

119
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
male protestor: this is not over!

120
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,490
i'm gonna be your worst nightmare!we are taking this to the next level!

121
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,260
boss, we had threats uttered yesterday by a member of an activist group

122
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,590
called "the olive branch collective.

123
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,980
" wordy: he wanted to take the protest to the next level.

124
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,940
jules: olive branch...

125
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,340
yep, they are on the csis watch list.

126
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,850
parker: it is not exactly a covert operation, they've got a downtown office address.

127
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,620
okay, here's what we've got.

128
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,710
we've narrowed the list of potential targets to three possibilities.

129
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,250
keffler corp, duchamp energy, and morgan-ellis.

130
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,180
now, they're all toxic bad boys fighting charges under the environmental protection act.

131
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,940
all right, good.we will talk to their heads of security,

132
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,560
we'll coordinate an immediate evac with fire and police.

133
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,830
- parker: all right, let's go.
- jules: let's go.

134
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,050
we'll take sam to help handle the bomb sweeps,

135
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,020
split the targets with the bomb techs from team 2 and team 5.

136
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,730
while you guys shake down the tree-huggers.

137
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,390
parker: environmental activists.

138
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,380
whatever.

139
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,620
man: hey, let's see your warrant.

140
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,760
we don't need a warrant to walk through an open door.

141
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,170
oh, no warrant?yeah, then you can turn around and walk right out that open door.

142
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,620
it's okay, jordan.

143
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,900
i'm john martens, can i help you?

144
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,850
sergeant greg parker, officer jules callaghan.

145
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,790
wanted to ask you a few questions about a bomb that was detonated at a construction site.

146
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,000
globalmax energy group.i just read the news feed.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,620
we understand you were there yesterday.

148
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,400
yeah, we staged a lawful non-violent protest action.

149
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,270
foreman said that you uttered threats to take it to the next level.

150
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,000
i threatened him?

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,840
have a look.

152
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,100
martens: you tell him "take it to the next level"

153
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,450
means unleash the most badass internet tition in history.

154
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,020
we don't do bombs.

155
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,760
we start with the carnage, we lose the public.

156
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,620
no more donations, our revenue streams dry up.

157
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,870
violence runs counter to our business model.

158
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,620
business models and revenue streams?

159
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,520
the times, they are a-changin'.

160
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,450
yeah, well, just because he speaks mba doesn't mean they're not into something harder.

161
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,780
hey, what if one of his comrades went rogue?

162
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,710
or maybe john martens is hiding in plain sight.

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,850
winnie, let's get a hold of with 41 division,

164
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,640
let's send an undercover unit to surveil john martens and the olive branch.

165
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,410
copy that.

166
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,570
ed: okay, let's split up.report back with evac status.

167
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,410
we're gonna start at the bottom, work our way up with fido, here.

168
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,550
sam and wordy: copy.got it.

169
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,050
spike: boss, we got something.

170
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,140
we've been working on finding our guy's signature.

171
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,360
signature?

172
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,090
spike: yeah, bombers, they tend to be consistent;

173
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,190
they find their favourite materials and their techniques and they stick to them.

174
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,660
so it could be a specific photo-electric sensor from a smoke detector...

175
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,230
- okay...
- or a specific pattn of circuits.

176
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,370
so we ran all the elements through the federal signature database.

177
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,610
find a match?

178
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,160
spike: hey, boss, i know the database doesn't lie,

179
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,540
but lou's never heard of these guys, i've never heard of these guys.

180
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,410
the p.l.c.?people's liberation core.

181
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,970
p.l.c.that goes back.

182
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,060
winnie, you got anything for us?

183
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,270
winnie: uh, full membership number unknown.

184
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,280
string of environmentally related bombings, late '70s.

185
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,800
leaders...vanessa and sheldon kominski, arrested in 1980.

186
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,410
okay, any recent activity?

187
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,510
winnie: nhing reported.

188
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,710
parker: what about our friends, the kominskis?

189
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,400
vanessa and sheldon kominski are now faculty at the university.

190
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,130
- parker: how's that?
- professors emeritus, poli-sci.

191
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,290
professors, huh?

192
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,470
times are a-changin'.

193
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,030
this is the most powerful aspect of hegemony.

194
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,710
state control is redundant.

195
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,790
we've internalized the values...

196
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,280
parker: sheldon and vanessa kominski?

197
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,050
we need a word with you.

198
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,270
speaking of state control, is today "show and tell"?

199
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,520
sheldon: we've always been very open about our past with the p.l.c.

200
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,250
it's probably what gives us credibility with our students.

201
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,520
but the membership's long dispersed and we've had a lot of time to think,

202
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,570
as one does behind bars.

203
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,850
besides, as soon as we were released, i got pregnant with sara.

204
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,590
- jules: is this sara?
- vanessa: yes.

205
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,190
vanessa: how could we run around being outlaws when we had a responsibility to her?

206
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,420
okay, well, then how do you explain this morning's bomb had the p.l.c.signature?

207
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,730
there was only one bomb technician among us, rafer wilcox.

208
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,170
- where do we find him?
- no idea.we hardly see him.

209
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,460
27 minutes until the next bomb goes off.think hard, we need to talk to him.

210
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,870
rafer's always lived off the grid, on principle.

211
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,720
and to tell the truth, ever since we had sara, we kept our distance.

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,180
okay, but is there something you can give us...

213
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,090
a former address?an alias?

214
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,200
he used to go by simon richdale.

215
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,280
other times it was ronald mellor.

216
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,040
that's great.thank you very much for your time.

217
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,010
- boss?
- eddie.

218
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,870
ed: we're in the machine room, keffler corp.

219
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,850
we got bomb number two.

220
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,480
flashpoint
Season 03 Episode 01

221
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,240
lewis: 11:43 am, bomb call, robot sending out signal blocking remote detonation.

222
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,070
spike: we're sending in babycakes.

223
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,360
assuming the device is triggered by a timer, boss, we got 25 minutes until detonation.

224
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,290
that's also assuming our guy's any good at setting timers.

225
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,510
and that he plans on sticking to the schedule.

226
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,030
spike, i'm gonna come out there and give you a hand.

227
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,610
forget it.rule number one of diffusion:

228
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,420
don't blow stuff up?

229
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,590
never more than one man down-range.you know that.

230
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,700
sam: let's go, let's keep this moving.we need to evacuate this building immediately.

231
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,060
sorry, ma'am, we need to keep moving.

232
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,080
businesswoman: let me get this, just take a sec.

233
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,920
there's no time, we need you to keep moving.

234
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,700
i didn't get my laptop.i have to go back for it.it'll only take a minute.

235
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,960
i've got eleven years worth of work on it.

236
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,670
sam mam, if anything happens, i'm not gonna be the one to tell your family it was just gonna take a minute.

237
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,130
let's keep ming.

238
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,460
parker: winnie, has the lab come back with anything on the tnt?

239
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,420
winnie: just in.

240
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,280
manufacturer's name is procan chemical.

241
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,240
that's great.

242
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,060
now let's look into purchases made by a ronald mellor or a simon richdale, last six months.

243
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,340
opy that.i' red flag large quantities.

244
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,250
no.negative.notarge quantities.

245
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,780
large quantities is for legitimate industrial clients.

246
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,610
we're looking for small quantities only.

247
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,290
knew that.

248
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,860
ed: building's secure.spike's the only remaining personnel.

249
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,830
spike: and babycakes.don't forget babycakes.

250
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,820
okay, spike, read me the tea leaves.

251
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,450
okay, you see that shadow, top left?that's looking like a digital clock.

252
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,600
so it is s to trigger byimer.

253
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,080
ed: let's set up transport to move this bomb off site.we've got 21 minutes.

254
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,010
spike: exce you see those two shadows, bottom lef those are mercury switches.

255
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,490
motion sensitive.

256
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,430
spike: motion very sensitive.

257
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,590
can't me it.

258
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,060
gonna take human hands not to setit off.

259
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,390
i'm going in.

260
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,070
spike...

261
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,730
okay.

262
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,270
copy that.

263
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,880
sarge, we got another call coming through.

264
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,450
i'm patching th one in live.

265
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:59,530
voice: the third bomb will detonate 12:30 pm on the campus of halliwell technical college.

266
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,540
the third bomb will detonate 12:30 pm...

267
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,190
all right, that's 40 minutes from now.he's picking up the pace.

268
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,310
dividing to conquer.

269
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,070
parker: jules, you stay here with spike.

270
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,100

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,490

boss, we got a trap door.

300
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,650
you're responsible for the bombs?

301
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,800
rafer: no, globalmax energy group and keffler are responsible for the bombs.

302
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,020
we just put them there.

303
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,390

then y're gonna talk fast.

310
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,030
wordy: sarge, we found his maps.

311
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,890
the third bomb...

312
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,430
is located at the foot of the earth sciences building.

313
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,980
sam: and he knows what he's dng.he's planted the bomb at a suppo column.

314
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,240
it blows, that building comes down.

315
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,390
copy that.we're seconds away.

316
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,300
sam: the good news is, it looks like it's the last of 3 targets.

317
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,910
you said, "we just put them there.

318
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,140
" is thisc.?

319
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,040
no, the kominskis took everything we fought for, spat on it,

320
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,830
and sold it out for an ivory tower tnure.

321
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,360
we just need the schematics for the bombs.

322
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,050
i'm running out of time to make a difference, so i'm calling the shots now.

323
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,270
we're getting the message out.

324
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,660
you and who else?

325
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,800
- i can't hear you.

326
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,840
no, you don't get to lecture me about human lives, jacoot.

327
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,640
we need to defuse the bomb, please.

328
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,390
how do you defuse the bombs, rafer, please?

329
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,870
i'm not the one to blame for collateral damage.

330
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,140
you and who else?

331
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,690
- this is what i'm here for.
- you oka?you and who else?

332
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,040
you and who else, buddy?you and o else, please?

333
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,710
parker: he gave himself a heart attack?

334
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,660
he injected himself with air.

335
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,900
okay, did you get anything out of him, eddie?

336
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,050
ed: yeah, he's not working alone.

337
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,560
wordy: andwas sick.

338
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,250
sam: yeah, his hands were shaking.

339
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,980
assembling a bomb is precision work.he'd need someone with steady hands.

340
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,980
let's tear this place apart.we look for emails, letter anything that can help us id the accomplice.

341
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,260
let's go.

342
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,290
spike: you guys?schematics.

343
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,320
schematics would be great.

344
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,360
parker: all right, team, our subject, may he rest in peace,

345
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,750
has left us juggling an unidentified accomplice and two scheduled detonations.

346
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,130
11 minutes to go on the keffler corp bomb, 29 minutes to go...

347
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,040
on the halliwell college bomb.

348
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,470
ed: this guy wants to save the world, make a big statement,

349
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,130
"oh, i know, let's blow up some college students, that'd be good.

350
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,110
" it's not just that.hliwell college just signed a huge funding deal with the lyrium think tank.

351
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,980
global warming deniers.

352
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,880
parker: the way he saw it, they're brainwashing a new generation of climate killers.

353
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,310
wordy: sarge?halliwell?lyrium?

354
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,380

355
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,970

361
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,870
spike, what kind of schematic are we looking for?

362
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,320
anything showing a circuit and 3 batters.i'm flying blind here.

363
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,920
half these wires are dummy, and he's given me 3 det wires to choose from.

364
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,920
i cut the wrong one, or i even touch a crush wire...

365
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,530
copy that.

366
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,610

378
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,320
i checked the membership records, there's no rafer wilcox or any of his aliases.

379
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,140
well, it's his accomplice that we're looking for.

380
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,850
- can you upload the bulk club security feed to me, please?
- i'm on it.

381

it's the only one connected to the
active detonator on the third battery.

474
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,530
unless that's what
he wants you to think.

475
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,260

schematic lying around?

476
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,890
he might.he didn't look toourprised to
see us.he may have been expecting company.

00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,100
sara,that's not very nice.

539
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,700
mr.kominski.

540
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,750
sara and rafer have any history?

541
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,680
there's no aughter is involved.

542
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,210
she bought the batteries that
triggered these bombs,sir.

543
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,290
- she was rafer's accomplice.
- there's a mistake.

544
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,270
no,sir,there was no mistake.

545
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,150
we hardly see him.

546
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,630
hould he have dragged her into this?

547
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,510
last time we saw him,he dropped
by the office,out of the blue.

548
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,900
about 3 years ago.

549
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,800
he hadn't seen sara since she was a kid.

550
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,560
for ten years they're killing a
river,poisoning an entire community.

551
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,270
because nobody does anything.

552
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,310
one night is all it took.

553
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,560
morning,rafer.

554
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,100
morning,professors.

555
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,100

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,600
oh,that son of a bitch!

559
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,410

life a half hour ago.

560
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,500
boss,60 seconds.

561
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,380

562
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,350
move 'em back.

563
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,020
building's not clear!

564
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,790
- what?
- we got kids on the roof somewhere,we just found 'em.

565
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,960
buildings not clear.

566
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,990
come on,inspector,do it fast!

567
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,450
right side of the
relay,a y-circuit,3 wires.

568
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,940
- yeah.
- east wire,east of the "y",where it splits.

569
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,570
you got it?

570
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,790
that's east.

571
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,820
- that's your det wire.
- okay.

572
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,870
no wrong turns,right,buddy?

573
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,770
no wrong turns.

574
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,540
done.

575
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,580
inspector,bomb's defused.

576
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,930
the land mine's not.

577
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,890
sara!all right,here it comes.

578
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,680
is it true,you and rafer?

579
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,480
yeah,it is,so lock me up.

580
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,690
you know,you weren't so scared of jail
yourselves,when there was important work to do.

581
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,040
all right,i've had enough of this.

582
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,710
land mine sara,tell me about 'em.

583
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,010
what,land mines?

584
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,650
don't play dumb.

585
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,030
no,i swear,we would never do
land mines.property damage only.

586
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,310
that's why we gave advanced warning.

587
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,140
oh,oh my god,rafer.

588
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,750
uh,we set the bombs
last night,about 3:00 am,

589
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,660
and then he insisted that i go home.

590
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,970
he didn't set those bombs himself,with
his unsteady hands.come on,sara.

591
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,670
land mines are totally safe
to handle until they're armed.

592
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,820
get her out of here.

593
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,770
- lou,you feel that trigger under your foot?
- yeah.

594
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,300
okay,what does it feel like
- at,a spike,or a bunch of spikes?

595
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,500
it's a buncof spikes.

596
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,050
- gotcha
- what are you doing?

597
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,450
these mines are plastic.a metal detector won't
work.i'm gonna use a ground penetrating radar.

598
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,890
spike,gpr is not...

599
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,060
you got something
better in your backpack?

600
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,670
spike,it's a land mine.

601
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,070
he is on the trigger.now,even
if you make your way through...

602
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,210
i'm gonna get him out.

603
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,700
spike,stay where you are!

604
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,910
lou,buddy,what are you doing?

605
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,650
hey,lou,you found us,huh?

606
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,740

608
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,640
no,you can have two
men down range,spike.

609
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,890
oh,what's the fifth rule,lou?

610
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,790
fifth rule is break the
rules when you have to.

611
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,430
he's not wrong.

612
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,380
this job's about what?

613
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,090
yeah,saving lives.

614
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,190

620
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,840

00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,800
there's ather one.

622
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,230
this guy was busy.

623
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,030
okay,we're car.

624
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,230
what took you so long,man?

625
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,800
traffic.you know how it is.

626
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,180
what're you doing?

627
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,880
i'm gonna see if he
booby-trapped the booby trap.

628
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,570
keep your foot still,okay?

629
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,570
yeah.

630
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,970
yeah,there it is.

631
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,070
okay,here we,let's see
what we're loong at.

632
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,320
move them back!

633
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,020
this is still a contained situation!

634
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,250
spike,what do you see?

635
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,730
whwe got,ike?

636
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,580
spike.

637
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,270
it's a bounding mine.

638
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,330
it's a cr-38.

639
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,090
i think you should just
get outta here,spike.

640
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,790
doesn't change a
thing,man.not single thing.

641
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,450
spike,we gotta strategize here.

642
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,240
nothing to strategize.

643
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,770
- i'm gonna defuse the land mine and lou's gonna walk aw
- defuse it how?

644
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,240
i'm gonna excavate around the
mine,and then i'm gonna render it safe.

645
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,110
- spike...
- shut up.

646
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,470
i'm getting you of here,we're
all going home today.

647
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,800
- **
- yeah,they're russian.

648
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,230
igniter sets off a propelling charge,it
fires the mine a metre in the air,

649
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,440
that ignites the main charge.

650
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
what if we get a shield out there?

651
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,710
it's not gonna do any good.

652
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,400
the cr-38
is anti-tank.

653
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,200
can spike defuse it?

654
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,670
sam?

655
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,080
it's a 38.

656
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,410
maybe he can re-pin it.

657
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,030
land mines,man.you don't
mess with land mines.

658
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,150
it'll take two men down instead of one.

659
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,910
if anybody can do it,it's spike.

660
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,280
if i were the sarge,i'd
give him a direct oer.

661
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,340
well,if i was spike i'd pretend
i didn't hear that order.

662
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,300
almost there,buddy.

663
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,270
almost there.

664
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,170
you know what i'm looking for?

665
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,440
it's a little hole.these,these
mines,they come with a safety.

666
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,180
with a little luck,i
can re-pin the hole.

667
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,700
fir rule of tactic never rely on luck.

668
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,030
did you say something?

669
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,990
okay,hello.

670
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,140
there you are.

671
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,300
you got it?

672
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,260
status report,spike.

673
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,690
he glued it.

674
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,660
he glued the hole.

675
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,930
i can't even touch it.

676
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,990
no,no...no,no...no.

677
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,580
come on,we gotta think of something.

678
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,830
we dissolve it with acid?

679
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,440
freeze it with liquinitrogen.

680
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,970
oy works on electronics.that
mine's mechanical.

681
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,670
sam?

682
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,610
you gotta pull spe outta there,boss.

683
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,880
- how many shields we got in the truck?
- won't do any good.

684
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,610
hold your foot still,okay?

685
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,200
i'just gonna re-stabilize.

686
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,420
okay,i know there's a way.

687
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,560
there's always a way.

688
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,560
of course there is.

689
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,690
okay,he sealed down the safety with glue;i
can lock down the spikes with glue,unless...

690
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,110
remember in ocho rios?

691
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,670

kids took us to that jump-up?

692
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,680
y,that was good.

693
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,280
okay,neodymium magnet.

694
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,600
w-we'll place it underneath,wll
lock down all moving parts.

695
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,060
bridget and her friend...

696
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,540

697
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,380

698
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,060
aays feels good in the ocean,man.

699
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,100
you get rocked by the waves...

700
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,550
like you're going full circle,you
know?back to being a baby again.

701
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,470

702
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,580
water!

703
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,460
we'll do a weight transfer.

704
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,620
oh,it could w we run water into a
container a gallon of water is what,

705
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,180

706
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,450
spike,you know what you should do?

707
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,330

708
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,400
you should call up bridget.

709
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,870

710
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,760

711
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,200
she loves baseball.you should
call her up,you should take her ou

712
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,930
we transfer the weight.

713
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,900
it's a good shot,it's
the best shot we...

714
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,370
it's a good shot!

715
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,000
- spike.
- i'm not leaving you okay.

716
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,000
okay,water,we'll do it.

717
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,180
but first get the explosives
from the first bomb out of range.

718
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,430
no,no,no,it's defused,you
cut the detonator.

719
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,610
spike,the mine goes off,it triggers the
tnt in there,we bring the building down.

720
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,420
okay?

721
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,950
we just gotta py it safe.

722
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,980
it's a gd thought.

723
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,110
i have my moments.

724
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,360
don't go anywhere.

725
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,560
i'm gonna see you in a bit,okay?

726
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,900
it's not going to work.

727
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,010
- you don't know that.
- actually,i think i do know about that.

728
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,030
radios off.

729
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,840
sam,how do you know that?

730
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,490
that's the trigger.that's his foot.

731
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,330
you're not getting anything in between
there without a decrease in pressure.

732
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,760
no offence,but do you
know that for sure?

733
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,090
i've dealt with mines in the field.

734
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,440
so you know everything that is to know?

735
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,730
- i didn't say that.
- easy.easy,guys.

736
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,900
sam?

737
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,110
- is spike's plan gonna work?
- the chances are not good.

738
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,810
okay,so you don't know.

739
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,300
- i know physics.
- oh,andi don't?

740
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,590
what i know is that
it's a long-shot at best.

741
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,130
'kay,a long shot is still a shot.

742
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,200
greg,we're talking about two lives here.

743
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,010
wordy: let's give spike a chance.

744
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,810
you wanna see two guys get blown
up by giving spike a chance?

745
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,690
okay.

746
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,560
spike?spike,maybe we
should slow this thing down.

747
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,400

748
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,490

00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,060
like a shield.somebody grab a shield.

751
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,570
- we can't let him go back out there.
- he's made up his mind.

752
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,120
he's emotional,he's panicking,he
is not thinking straight.

- you gotta make the call.

758
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,670
i'm not gonna be the one to hold
him back from saving a friend.

759
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,950
and i'm not gonna lose 'em both.

760
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,020
