181
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:15,096
took off with a hostage.

182
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:16,331
Ed:
How'd it go down?

183
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,565
Two Asian guys -
gang members, we think -

184
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:18,565
came out of the house
with an older guy,

185
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:19,766
started firing.

186
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:20,767
How'd you know
he was a hostage?

187
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,035
They were using him
as a shield.

188
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:23,503
Chinese, 50's.

189
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:24,605
Uh, nobody's left
in that house,

190
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:25,839
we checked.
It's clear.

191
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:27,173
Okay, thank you.
Boss, the father,

192
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,642
Zhen Mai, was taken hostage.

193
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,377
There's no sign of Ruby.

194
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,011
We're looking at
a double kidnapping here.

195
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,880
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Copy that, Eddie.</i>

196
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:34,880
Detective Lee?

197
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:36,048
Hey. Sergeant Parker?

198
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:37,082
Yeah.
Thanks for coming down.

199
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,384
My pleasure.
Call me Vivian.

200
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:39,619
Greg.

201
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,687
Double kidnapping,
officers taking fire...

202
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:42,788
Hell of a Monday morning.

203
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:43,889
Yeah, no kidding, right?

204
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:45,491
Hoping you can give us
a leg up.

205
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,426
Well, this area of Chinatown
is under the control

206
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:48,761
of the Golden Dragons.

207
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:50,962
This sound like
their kind of action?

208
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,196
Vivian:
Honestly, no.

209
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,598
They're more into
protection rackets,

210
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,867
heroin trafficking, gambling.

211
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:56,868
It's unusual for them

212
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:58,102
to resort to brazen violence.

213
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,404
They don't like
to draw attention.

214
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:00,872
Well, if they're trying
shake this shop down

215
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:02,607
and the owners refused
to cooperate...

216
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,941
It's possible,

217
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,677
but why go to the trouble
of kidnapping them?

218
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,344
Why not just damage the shop

219
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:08,545
or beat someone up?

220
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:11,148
Sends a simpler message,
comply or else.

221
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:12,916
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Boss, I think
I can</i> <i>answer that.</i>

222
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:14,251
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Okay, we'll be
right there,</i> <i>Jules.</i>

223
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,386
Follow me.

224
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:20,023
(Keys clack, computer beeps)

225
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,559
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Jules Callaghan.</i>

226
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,828
Detective Vivian Lee,
Asian crime squad.

227
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:26,929
Thanks for helping us out.

228
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:28,531
Vivien:
Sure.

229
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,999
All right, the hard drive
on the shop computer was taken,

230
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,101
but I found a jump drive
in the back of the cash drawer

231
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,236
with these images on it.

232
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:36,739
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Some tough customers.</i>

233
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:37,774
Can I see that one?

234
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:39,474
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

235
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,644
<i>Vivian:</i> <i>That's the
Dragons' boss,</i> <i>Wei Caa.</i>

236
00:11:42,712 --> 00:11:43,912
And next to him, Jimmy Ying.

237
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,880
He's Chua's right-hand man.

238
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:46,915
No. You see here?

239
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,617
<i>Can you zoom in?</i>

240
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:51,119
<i>Those cigarette burns</i>
<i>are the mark of the Dragons.</i>

241
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:53,121
Looks like the Dragons
are collecting payoffs.

242
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:54,388
There's images on here

243
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,989
from at least
four different stores.

244
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:57,191
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Well, this is
some sort</i> <i>of resistance.</i>

245
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,659
The shop owners
are collecting evidence

246
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,594
against the extortion racket.

247
00:12:00,662 --> 00:12:02,062
Not unless someone's
willing to testify

248
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,831
and explain what's happening.

249
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:06,066
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Motive for a
kidnapping,</i> <i>or worse.</i>

250
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:08,402
Parker: Any idea where the Dragons
might've taken their hostages.

251
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,503
<i>Vivian:</i> <i>I can have my
people</i> <i>try and narrow it down</i>

252
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,472
to a list of known
Dragon locations.

253
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,073
But we might have
another way in,

254
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:15,775
drug squad has wires
on the cell phones

255
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:17,677
of two active Dragon soldiers.

256
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:19,278
We can piggyback on those.

257
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:20,313
Let's do it.

258
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:21,514
Those merchants are at risk too.

259
00:12:21,582 --> 00:12:22,615
I'm gonna see if I can identify

260
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:24,183
any of the shops
in these images.

261
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,719
Winnie: - Boss?
Parker: - Yeah, Winnie?

262
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,220
The 911 call was made
by a Terrence Lau.

263
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,855
He owns the Po Chi Lau
herbal medicine shop,

264
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:31,957
<i>1612 Nassau street.</i>

265
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:35,260
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Boss, that description
matches</i> <i>one of the shops on video.</i>

266
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:37,329
<i>Herbs, mushrooms, teas.</i>

267
00:12:38,264 --> 00:12:40,499
Parker: Gentlemen, I need you to
check out that medicine shop.

268
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,967
Our 911 caller might be
part of this resistance.

269
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,402
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Will do.</i>

270
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,336
I'll let you know
as soon as I have something.

271
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:46,537
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Thanks, Vivian.</i>

272
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:47,572
<i>Winnie:</i>
<i>And, boss, one more thing.</i>

273
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,706
Yeah, Winnie, go ahead.

274
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:51,509
<i>Winnie:</i>
<i>Your son's here.</i>

275
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:52,710
Dean's at hq?

276
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,178
I put him on a bus headed home.

277
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:55,312
<i>Is he okay?</i>

278
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:56,748
Yeah, he's fine.

279
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:58,115
He didn't even want me
to tell you he's here.

280
00:12:58,183 --> 00:12:59,716
But he said
he'd talk to you later.

281
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:01,385
Winnie, I...

282
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:02,619
<i>Winnie:</i> <i>It's okay, boss.
</i> <i>I'll take care of him.</i>

283
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:04,954
(Sighs)
Okay, thank you, Winnie.

284
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,826
Terrence Lau?

285
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,029
Sir?

286
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,530
Terrence:
Yes?

287
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:16,732
Sir, I'm officer Lane,
this is officer Rousseau.

288
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,333
<i>Strategic response unit.</i>

289
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:20,803
You called 911, right?

290
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:23,105
Is Ruby okay?

291
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,106
We think she's been abducted,

292
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:26,208
along with her father.

293
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,744
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Sir, you did the right
thing</i> <i>calling 911,</i>

294
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,145
but we still need
your help here.

295
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,880
Now, do you have any idea
where the Dragons

296
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,214
may have taken Ruby
and her dad?

297
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,349
I don't, honestly.

298
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:38,553
May I?

299
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:54,735
Mr. Lau, we know that
you're a victim here too,

300
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:57,137
<i>and we know that you've been</i>
<i>working against the Dragons.</i>

301
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,572
<i>Raf:</i> <i>Can you give us
names</i> <i>and descriptions</i>

302
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,808
of any of the gang members?

303
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,142
I do that and they find out,

304
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,543
my family is next.

305
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,877
Sounds to me like a good reason

306
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,145
for you to step up.

307
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,213
What happened to you,
little man?

308
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,649
Oh. My son, Eugene.

309
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,318
He's been fighting
with other boys again

310
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,086
in the neighborhood.

311
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,722
<i>Raf:</i> <i>You see anything, Eugene?
</i> <i>Anything at all?</i>

312
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,824
No.

313
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:18,757
Raf:
Really? Sure about that?

314
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,625
I told you no, okay?

315
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,026
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

316
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,161
Okay.

317
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,767
If you care about Ruby,

318
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,937
you need to tell us
what you know here.

319
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,772
Okay. Raf.

320
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:42,079
<i>Man:</i> <i>Look, I told you
,</i> <i>I know these people.</i>

321
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:43,213
Just tell me what happened.

322
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:44,482
Parker:
Officer? It's all right.

323
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,049
Come here, son.

324
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,885
Jules:
You have some id?

325
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,286
Dixon green.

326
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:50,954
Now what the hell happened?
Is Ruby okay?

327
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:52,154
How do you know Ruby?

328
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,356
I'm her sensei.

329
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:54,156
I work at a martial arts studio

330
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:55,157
on Bloor.

331
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:56,258
Ruby's my student.

332
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,193
You always check
on your students

333
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,895
at their workplace?

334
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,096
Ruby's more than a student,
okay?

335
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,731
I care about her.

336
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,333
We believe Ruby's
been kidnapped,

337
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,635
as well as her father.

338
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,236
Oh, no, no, no, no, no...

339
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:10,873
Why wouldn't she listen?

340
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,374
Okay, look,
I know who did this.

341
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:13,475
It's a gang.

342
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:14,810
They're called
the Golden Dragons.

343
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:16,478
They've been squeezing Ruby
and her dad for years.

344
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:17,746
Is that why
she takes martial arts?

345
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:18,981
To protect herself?

346
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,949
Ruby? No.
She wants to fight back.

347
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:22,150
She's been gathering evidence

348
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:22,950
with all the other shop owners

349
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,318
against the Dragons.

350
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:25,887
Someone must've ratted her out.

351
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:28,155
Do you know
who she's working with?

352
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:29,490
I don't know.

353
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:30,957
She knew I was against
the whole thing.

354
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:32,192
Made me swear not to tell
the bit that I did know.

355
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,360
<i>I don't even think</i>
<i>her dad knows.</i>

356
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:35,629
What about her mother?

357
00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:37,498
Her mother died last year
in a fire

358
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:40,100
in that warehouse right here.

359
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:41,435
<i>Ruby's pretty torn up</i> <i>about it,</i>

360
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:44,204
and her dad...
He's still not over it.

361
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:45,739
Okay.

362
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:47,006
Just stay close, will you?

363
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,275
We may need to ask you
some more questions.

364
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:51,610
Officer?
Just keep an eye on him.

365
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:52,778
Ruby's running the resistance,

366
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:54,380
but they take her father too.

367
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:56,416
Might not have known
she was acting alone.

368
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,151
(Into headset)
Go ahead, Vivien.

369
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,252
<i>Vivien:</i> <i>Hey.
So, my team has just</i> <i>recorded a call</i>

370
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:00,819
between a Golden Dragon soldier

371
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:01,820
name of Phu Wan

372
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:03,288
and an unknown female.

373
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:04,856
<i>I'm sending you</i> <i>the audio file.</i>

374
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,660
Vivian, I'm loading
the audio file now.

375
00:16:10,063 --> 00:16:11,530
<i>Female:</i>
<i>I got your message.</i>

376
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:12,964
<i>Male:</i> <i>You did the
right thing</i> <i>calling.</i>

377
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:14,566
<i>No reason for all of this.</i>

378
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:16,101
<i>Everything's okay, right?</i>

379
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:17,369
<i>Female:</i> <i>I don't
know,</i> <i>you tell me.</i>

380
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:18,669
<i>Male:</i>
<i>Everything's okay.</i>

381
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,604
Stop the tape.

382
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:22,540
You thinking what I'm thinking?

383
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,175
Maybe it's Ruby.

384
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:25,909
Parker:
Let's get Dixon in here.

385
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:28,412
<i>Vivien, thing is,</i>

386
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,847
no one actually saw Ruby
get abducted.

387
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:32,383
Maybe she got away.

388
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,584
Maybe she's the shooter,
not the other way around.

389
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:36,719
But why wouldn't she go
to the police?

390
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,188
She may not trust us.

391
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:40,523
The Dragons had an officer
on the payroll in the past.

392
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,325
<i>There's more</i> <i>you need to hear.</i>

393
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,327
Dixon, you recognize
any of these voices?

394
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,230
(Key clacks, computer beeps)

395
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,931
Female: You really
think I'm that stupid?

396
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:50,765
<i>Give me one reason</i>
<i>why I should believe you.</i>

397
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,568
That's Ruby.

398
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:53,935
<i>Male:</i> <i>We need to know who</i>
<i>you've been talking to.</i>

399
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:55,904
<i>You tell us,</i>
<i>everybody goes home, okay?</i>

400
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:57,406
<i>Ruby:</i>
<i>Augusta street cafe.</i>

401
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,408
<i>15 minutes,</i> <i>on the patio.</i>

402
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,942
<i>Male:</i>
<i>Come alone.</i>

403
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,711
<i>You talk to the police,</i>
<i>you know what happens.</i>

404
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,246
- Ruby's okay?
- Yeah, she is for now,

405
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,647
but we're running out of time.

406
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,748
We need your help.
You mind coming with us?

407
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,650
Jules, let's go.
Vivian...

408
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:10,851
Vivian:
I'll meet you there.

409
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,521
(Car horn honks)

410
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,223
Parker: She gets away
from two armed gangsters

411
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,424
and now she's trying
to negotiate

412
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:17,958
her own father's release.

413
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,594
The kid's got brass.

414
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:21,429
Jules: That brass is gonna
get her into trouble.

415
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:22,762
<i>Ed:</i> <i>There's no chance the
Dragons</i> <i>will honor that deal.</i>

416
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,431
Jules:
No, they need Ruby alive

417
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:26,266
so that she can give
the names of her resistance.

418
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,768
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Intimidate anybody</i>
<i>who might wanna testify.</i>

419
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,470
Might try to abduct her again.

420
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:32,272
Ed: We gotta be in
position to protect her

421
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,541
without letting the Dragons know
we're there.

422
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:36,042
<i>Okay, guys,</i>

423
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,610
<i>looks like we'll need</i>
<i>some civvies here.</i>

424
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:44,216
(Door clunks shut)

425
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:45,851
<i>Where we at, guys?</i>

426
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,053
Spike:
Almost there with the parabolic.

427
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:49,188
Thank you.

428
00:17:50,123 --> 00:17:51,990
Copy that, Spike.
Sam?

429
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:55,126
Sam: A lot of civilians,
including Ruby.

430
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:56,727
I'm going less lethal.

431
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:58,095
Ed:
Good call.

432
00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,264
Raf? Jules?

433
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:00,398
In position.

434
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:04,835
Jules:
Six o'clock, Ed.

435
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:09,040
You clean up well.

436
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:10,240
You too.

437
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,742
Spike, you hear me?

438
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,145
In full stereophonic sound.

439
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,350
<i>Parker:</i> <i>All right, no one
gets made,</i> <i>you understand?</i>

440
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:21,885
Dragons think Ruby's
working with us,

441
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:23,353
<i>they could have</i>
<i>her father killed.</i>

442
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:25,389
<i>Spike: Got it.</i>
<i>Sam: Copy.</i>

443
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:26,656
<i>Vivian:</i> <i>My team's just narrowed
down</i> <i>the possible locations to five.</i>

444
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,023
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>That's good work.</i>

445
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,591
<i>We'll give 'em</i>
<i>as much time as we can.</i>

446
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:32,895
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Two, please.</i>

447
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:34,263
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Dark blazer, spiky hair.</i>

448
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:35,498
<i>Vivian:</i> <i>That's Lak
Tang,</i> <i>senior guy.</i>

449
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:37,132
Reports directly to Chua.

450
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,534
You hear that, Eddie?

451
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,936
He's headed toward a table.

452
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,607
We got eyes.

453
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,915
Tang: Just give me a minute
and then we'll order.

454
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,551
Sidewalk next to the patio,
on a motorcycle.

455
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:57,985
<i>Vivian:</i>
<i>Yes. A soldier.</i>

456
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,119
Confirmed.

457
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:11,998
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Okay, I think that's her.</i>

458
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,141
Where's my father?

459
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:23,276
Don't worry.

460
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:24,711
If you do your part,
we'll do ours.

461
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:27,213
Ruby:
I wanna see him, first.

462
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:28,615
<i>Tang:</i>
<i>Don't be stupid.</i>

463
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:29,549
<i>All I have to do</i>
<i>is make one quick call</i>

464
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:30,549
<i>and that's it.</i>

465
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:31,683
He dies.

466
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,853
You write down the names
of your friends

467
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,755
and we check it out.

468
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:37,889
If you're telling the truth,

469
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,358
we'll let him go.

470
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,064
Brave girl.

471
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:48,599
Your father doesn't deserve
your loyalty.

472
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,468
What're you talking about?

473
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,503
Last chance
to change your mind.

474
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:54,605
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Okay, he's making a call.</i>

475
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:56,674
Put the phone down.

476
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,476
Now.

477
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:00,344
Do it now.
(Cocks gun)

478
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,345
Gun.
Ruby's got a gun.

479
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:13,135
You're making a big mistake.

480
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:21,309
Soldier's on the move.

481
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:23,778
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>We gotta move now.</i>

482
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:29,951
Let's take him.

483
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,253
Right there.
Right there.

484
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:38,225
Get down! Drop the gun!
Drop the gun now!

485
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:39,759
Jules: Weapon on the ground.
Weapon on the ground.

486
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:40,794
Turn around, turn around.

487
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:42,129
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>We got a bogey.</i>

488
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,131
Possible gang member
across the street.

489
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,665
<i>Vivien,</i> <i>can you confirm that?</i>

490
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:46,967
I can't be sure.

491
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:47,801
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>He's making a phone call.</i>

492
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:49,601
Boss...

493
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:51,737
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Hold your fire, Sam.
</i> <i>We need to make sure.</i>

494
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,940
Confirmed.
(Gunshot pops)

495
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,243
Raf: On the ground. Now!

496
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:58,244
I need you to come with me.

497
00:20:58,312 --> 00:20:59,745
You don't understand.

498
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:00,579
<i>As soon as they find out</i>
<i>police are involved,</i>

499
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:01,714
they'll kill my father.

500
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:03,615
That's why we need
to find him fast.

501
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:05,483
Lots of witnesses, Ed.

502
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:06,751
Don't want word getting back
to the Dragons

503
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:08,486
that the police are involved.

504
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:09,888
Ed:
Copy that, Spike.

505
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:12,557
Let's get him off the street,
get some answers.

506
00:21:17,663 --> 00:21:19,297
You talked to them?

507
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,598
You promised me...

508
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,866
Dixon:
I was worried about you, okay?

509
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:23,567
You can't take them on
by yourself, Ruby.

510
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:25,269
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>It's okay.</i>

511
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:26,937
Ruby, my name is
Sergeant Greg Parker.

512
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:28,638
I'm with the strategic
response unit.

513
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:30,975
What you did was very brave,

514
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,442
but you put yourself
and your dad

515
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,111
in a lot of danger.

516
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:35,346
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Ruby, somebody
told</i> <i>the Dragons</i>

517
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:36,847
that you were coordinating
a resistance;

518
00:21:36,914 --> 00:21:38,514
Somebody who knew
what you were doing.

519
00:21:38,582 --> 00:21:41,450
Parker: You need to tell us
who you talked to, Ruby.

520
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:42,785
If we can find the leak,

521
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:44,254
maybe they could lead us
to your father.

522
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,827
I'll tell you,
but it won't do any good.

523
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,663
If someone told the Dragons
about me,

524
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,734
they're not gonna believe
you can protect them.

525
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:02,437
Ed:
Raf, give me a second.

526
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,274
Buddy, you tell me
where Zhen Mai is,

527
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:07,475
and I'm gonna help you out.

528

00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:09,778
You're 25-years-old,

you are gonna do 10 years
in prison.

531
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,847
You're okay with that?

532
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,382
Fair enough.
Raf?

Hey. Anything?

535
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,587
Ed:
Ice in his veins.

536
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,723
The gangs recruit these kids
when they're really young.

537
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,991
I mean, how're they doing it?
Is it drugs? Status? What?

538
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:26,593
They target a newcomer,

539
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,061
pay a couple of other kids
to bully him,

540
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,731
then a gang member
miraculously shows up,

541
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,198
scares the bullies.

542
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,534
Kid's so grateful,
next thing you know...

543
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:36,602
That easy.

- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

545
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:39,238

560
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,329
You gotta tell us

and I mean everything.

562
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:12,402
The Dragons,

they've been extorting us
for money for years.

564
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:19,176
Last year, Chua asked
for even more money.

565
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:21,010
Well, I like
the color assortment there.

566

He wanted to fight back.

00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:50,910
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Yeah, copy that, Eddie.
</i> <i>Why, what's going on?</i>

703
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:54,380
<i>Zhen:</i>
<i>Leave me be.</i>

704
00:29:54,448 --> 00:29:56,248
Minimal cognitive response,
tunnel vision.

705
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:57,484
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>He's not bluffing.</i>

706
00:29:57,551 --> 00:29:58,818
Tac options?

707
00:29:58,886 --> 00:29:59,953
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Rushing him is not a safe play.</i>

708
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,887
We need a fire extinguisher
up here now.

709
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:02,955
Go for it.

710
00:30:03,022 --> 00:30:04,790
(Breathes shakily)

711
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:06,792
Okay, fast as possible, Sam.

712
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,059
Jules and Raf,

713
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:09,227
let's go over everything we know
so far.

714
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,029
Let's dig into
his psychology here.

715
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:12,798
<i>Let's identify any triggers.</i>

716
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,132
We need to know
why this is happening,

717
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,601
why it's happening now.

718
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:17,735
- Copy.
- On it.

719
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:22,840
Ruby?

720
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:27,077
We found your father,
my people are with him.

721
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:29,146
But I need to ask you
a few questions.

722
00:30:29,214 --> 00:30:30,715
Why, did something happen
to him?

723
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:34,751
He's threatening
to take his own life.

724
00:30:35,686 --> 00:30:36,987
What?
I don't understand.

725
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:37,988
Yeah, we don't either.

726
00:30:38,056 --> 00:30:39,323
We need to figure this out

727
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:42,226
so we can stop him
from harming himself.

728
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:45,896
Ruby: (Screaming)
What'd you do to him?!

729
00:30:45,963 --> 00:30:49,132
Parker: Ruby, I need you
to stay calm, all right?

730
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:54,237
Spike:
Zhen? Ruby is safe.

731
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:57,140
She's out front
and she's waiting for you.

732
00:30:57,207 --> 00:30:58,274
Ruby...

733
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:00,543
She's so brave.

734
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,347
When she finds out
what I've done...

735
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:06,714
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Well he's done something
that</i> <i>he can't come to terms with.</i>

736
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,882
In Chinese culture,

737
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,917
suicide can be an honorable way

738
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:10,052
to alleviate shame.

739
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:13,588
Parker:
Ruby?

740
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:16,024
Can you think of any reason

741
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:18,760
why your father would be
in this state?

742
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:20,495
He's still mourning
the death of my mother,

743
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:21,762
but...

744
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:23,364
That can't be why.

745
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,299
All right, Ruby's mother died
in a warehouse fire

746
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:26,567
about a year ago, right?

747
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,968
The fire was determined
to be arson.

748
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:29,170
Investigators didn't
have enough evidence

749
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:30,637
to lay charges.

750
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,773
Ruby said that the Dragons
set the fire as retribution.

751
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,108
Retribution for what?

752
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,242
She didn't know.

753
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,544
She said her father
provoked them.

754
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,611
So he feels responsible.

755
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,413
Is that enough to ma h him
suicidal?

756
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:46,152
I just lost my father, Zhen.

757
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,088
We didn't always see
eye-to-eye,

758
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:50,790
<i>but I'd give anything</i>
<i>to have him back in my life.</i>

759
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:52,525
<i>Your daughter loves you.</i>

760
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:53,992
Let her help you.

761
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,627
She can't help me.

762
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:00,466
<i>Ed:</i> <i>He's unstable here, boss.
</i> <i>He's on the edge.</i>

763
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:01,766
Parker:
Copy that, Eddie.

764
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,435
Maybe it's time
to bring Ruby in.

765
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:04,903
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Are you sure, boss?</i>

766
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:06,771
Zhen's shame is focused on
what Ruby thinks of him.

767
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,073
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Not a lot of options, Jules.</i>

768
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:09,240
Maybe the emotional connection

769
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:11,175
could de-escalate
the situation.

770
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:12,310
(Ruby weeps quietly)

771
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:15,012
Ruby?

772
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:18,449
Are you up to talking
to your dad?

773
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:19,683
Can you do that?

774
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,252
Yes.

775
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,386
Come on.

776
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:25,989
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Zhen, it's okay.</i>

777
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,991
It's okay, my name's Ed.

778
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:29,559
I just need you
to listen to me for a sec.

779
00:32:29,627 --> 00:32:30,693
Stay back!

780
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,632
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Zhen, what you're
thinking</i> <i>about doing here,</i>

781
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:37,800
it doesn't always kill you.

782
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:40,170
It can leave you badly burned,

783
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:41,237
and in terrible pain.

784
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:42,605
Now you don't want that.

785
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:44,773
That's what I deserve.

786
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:46,908
To burn like my poor Lin.

787
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:48,344
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Your father's</i>
<i>in pretty bad shape.</i>

788
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:50,112
So the last thing we want
is for him to think

789
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,580
that he's upsetting you.

790
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:53,516
- Okay.
- So just connect to him,

791
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,083
just let him do the talking.

792
00:32:55,152 --> 00:32:57,285
Just put that in your ear,
all right?

793
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:59,454
Just remember that
you won't be alone.

794
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:00,588
Okay.

795
00:33:02,824 --> 00:33:04,825
Zhen received a full payout
from the insurance company

796
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:05,926
after the fire.

797
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:06,961
Ruby said that
he used that money

798
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,229
to pay off the Dragons.

799
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:09,397
So just when he needed
the money...

800
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:10,698
He gets it.

801
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:11,932
<i>Boss.</i>

802
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,233
I hear ya, Jules.

803
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:14,934
But there's no hard evidence.

804
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:16,403
<i>Jules:</i> <i>According to</i>
<i>the incident report,</i>

805
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:17,937
the wife ran inside
and tried to put out the blaze.

806
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:19,206
No insurance policy
on the wife.

807
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:20,474
He didn't intend
to hurt anyone.

808
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,309
And this is hitting him
now because?

809
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,710
Jules: Chua and Jimmy
threatened to tell Ruby

810
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:25,546
knowing it will make Zhen
suicidal.

811
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:27,481
They figure his suicide
will be devastating to Ruby

812
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:28,915
and that she'll have
nothing left to fight for.

813
00:33:28,983 --> 00:33:30,216
They clean up their mess,

814
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:31,950
sending a message
to the rest of Chinatown,

815
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:33,919
all without risking
a murder charge.

816
00:33:33,987 --> 00:33:35,721
And if it's not true,

817
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:37,290
it's a hell of an accusation.

818
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:38,757
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Well, she has to know</i>

819
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:40,893
'cause she's our only shot
at talking him down.

820
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:46,731
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Ruby, I have some
news</i> <i>about your father.</i>

821
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:50,483
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Zhen, whatever you've done,</i>

822
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,718
<i>it's not worth this.</i>

823
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:54,052
Zhen:
Stay back!

824
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,755
Ed:
All right.

825
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:59,425
Spike: Zhen, you do this now,
you hurt Ruby even more.

826
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:00,792
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Look, Ruby,</i>

827
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,527
<i>there's no easy way</i>
<i>to say this.</i>

828
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,228
There's a possibility
that it was your father

829
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:07,399
who set fire to the warehouse.

830
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:09,000
What're you talking about?

831
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,602
He might've done it
for the insurance money

832
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:12,370
to pay the Dragons.

833
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:13,571
If he did set that fire,

834
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:15,106
I'm sure he never intended
to hurt anyone.

835
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:16,440
Certainly not your mother.

836
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,708
No way.

837
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:19,009
He would never do tat.

838
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,211
I'm saying we don't know
for sure.

839
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:23,513
But it might explain why
he's in this state of mind.

840
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:27,683
You're the best chance we have
to getting through to him,

841
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,453
but if he did start that fire
and you can't forgive him,

842
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:32,588
then you can't help him.

843
00:34:37,394 --> 00:34:38,661
<i>(Door squeaks open)</i>
<i>Ruby: Ba??</i>

844
00:34:40,863 --> 00:34:41,930
<i>Ba.</i>

845
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:47,536
Why are you doing this?

846
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:49,270
I'm so sorry, Ruby.

847
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,607
It's true, isn't it?

848
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:56,410
You set the fire
that killed ma?

849
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:01,782
I did.

850
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:05,586
(Sobs)

851
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:08,522
I know it hurts.
I know it hurts,

852
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,925
but your father just tried
to protect your mother and you

853
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:13,626
to the best of his ability.

854
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,961
Why, ba?!

855
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:17,296
We could've just moved,
like ma wanted.

856
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:19,098
I didn't know what else to do.

857
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,033
We could have fought back.

858
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:24,838
I didn't want
to see you get hurt.

859
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:26,405
(Cries)

860
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:29,307
Parker: This isn't your
father's fault, Ruby.

861
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,642
<i>No, he can't shoulder</i>
<i>the blame.</i>

862

<i>Not now.</i>
<i>Not like this.</i>

863
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:34,913
<i>Zhen:</i>
<i>At least now you know.</i>

864
00:35:34,981 --> 00:35:36,381
Ruby:
Ba, wait!

865
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:39,585
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

866
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:42,420
Just think about
what he went through.

867
00:35:43,356 --> 00:35:45,122
You wanted to protect us.

868
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:49,093
<i>Ma didn't want you</i>
<i>to fight back.</i>

869
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,962
I was too weak.

870
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:54,064
I killed her.

871
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:01,371
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Now you need to forgive him.</i>

872
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:04,273
<i>He needs to hear that,</i> <i>Ruby.</i>

873
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:05,642
Ba...

<i>Remember when</i>
<i>we first moved here?</i>

875
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,647
I was so little.

876
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:14,183
I was so scared, I missed home.

877
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:17,052
You know what ma told me?

878
00:36:17,988 --> 00:36:20,455
She said you were a tiger.

879
00:36:20,524 --> 00:36:22,290
<i>She said you'd always</i>
<i>protect me.</i>

880
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:24,326
But I'm not.

881
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:25,628
You're the strong one.

883

I miss her so much.

887
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:40,174
But I still need you.

888
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,210
We still need each other.

Yeah. I, uh...

916
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,385
I didn't get on the bus.

917

I can see that.
What's going on?

918
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,422
Well, I, uh...

919
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,127
I just wanted to ask you
a question.

920
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,361
I thought...

921
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,098
If it was all right with you,

922
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,268
I could come live with you
for a while.

923
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,939
You and your mom
not getting along

924
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,140
or something?

925
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,109
No. No, it's not that.

926
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,713
I wanna be here,
you know, with you.

927
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:44,747
Does she know about this?

928
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,982
Yeah. I just...

929
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,418
I just told her I wanted
to bring it up with you first.

930
00:39:57,861 --> 00:39:58,794
I... I thought
you'd be happy.

931
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:00,561
I am.

932
00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:02,430
I'm very happy.

933
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:05,399
Listen.

934
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:08,569
This last year,

935
00:40:08,637 --> 00:40:11,472
getting to know
each other again,

936
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,775
it's been awesome.

937
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:16,376
I'm proud that you get
to see what I do

938
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:17,978
and that you've changed
your mind about me.

939
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:21,248
It's what I've always
hoped for.

940
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:23,250
But...

941
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:28,622
You and I just haven't spent
a whole lot of time together.

942
00:40:28,689 --> 00:40:30,724
I just don't want you
to be disappointed.

943
00:40:33,326 --> 00:40:34,794
I won't be.

944
00:40:37,597 --> 00:40:38,697
So?

945
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:40,833
Is it okay then?

946
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:42,368
(Half laughs)

947
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:44,937
Yeah.
Yeah, it's okay.

948
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:47,506
It's absolutely okay.
