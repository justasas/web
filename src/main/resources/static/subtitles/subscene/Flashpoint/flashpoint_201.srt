1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,789
Eagle One, Eagle Two on the move.

2
00:00:02,758 --> 00:00:04,447
Was this on the itinerary?

3
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:06,078
Sir,we got to move.

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,306
What about Katherine?

5
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:13,899
Ed, she's not here.

6
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:15,301
What's going on?Where
the hell is my wife?

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,782
Lewis, Wordy, get security to lock it
all down. All exits, temporary red alert.

8
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,970
Police! Strategic Response Unit

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,425
Police! Strategic Response Unit!
Is anybody in there?

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,238
Oh, dear God, please. Just say yes.
Say yes to however much they want.

11
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:38,811
They don't want money.

12
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:41,220
What do they want?

13
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:45,016
It is a twelve hour shift, plenty of OT

14
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:47,190
Be grateful we're spending it at the Royal York.

15
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:49,439
Four star hotel, great bathrooms.

16
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,324
Come on!
It's the Milenium Forum.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,990
Smartest people
in the world are gonna be there.

18
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:56,395
You guys might learn something.

19
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:58,550
- What, standing in the lobby?
- Osmosis, I live in hope.

20
00:00:58,865 --> 00:00:59,563
Okay

21
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:01,817
David Graham
He's our principal.

22
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,323
We call him Eagle 1.
Heard of this guy right?

23
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,883
Tell me you read a newspaper,
you know who this guy is.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,895
Billionaire industrialtype,
who turned billionaire human rights crusader.

25
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:13,728
His beautiful wife, Katherine.
She runs their foundation.

26
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,609
Graham is in town giving the welcome speech.

27
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:18,598
There's a big fancy-smanchy
cocktail party at the hotel.

28
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,334
The VIP guys are on him, but..

29
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:24,240
some bushly rockstar showed up without his
own security detail and and prom due, now.

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,992
They need us, okay.
Graham gives his keynote-speech at 7 tonight.

31
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:29,738
The good guys get him back to the airport.

32
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:33,627
We go home, take out the garbage,
and walk the dog.

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,586
Ahhh! Look at that little puppy.

34
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,078
Come on, we don't even have to do a recky on this thing.

35
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:41,341
It's all done, we got itineraries, floorplans,
underground access, express elevators.

36
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:42,301
look they even have staff security checks.

37
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:45,582
Samm, you're my second today.

38
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,713
Spike, Wordy and Louis, you're working access.

39
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:49,987
By access you mean?

40
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:52,847
- Exits and revolving doors.
- Awesome.

41
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:56,915
Jules, you're primary on the wife,
let's call her Eagle 2, just for fun

42
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:59,305
Cause you know why?
This job, it's gonna be fun.

43
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:00,754
What about Ed?

44
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:03,460
I'd say Ed is looking pretty darn sharp.

45
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,780
-Woo!
- Nice.

46
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,439
Could you just try to
be a little professional?

47
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:13,047
As you can no doubt surmise,
Mr. Lane is primary on Eagle One.

48
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,676
Jules, you're going to need
some plain clothes today.

49
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,759
Questions?

50
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:23,027
Hola Hola, Mami.

51
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:30,790
gracias.

52
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,765
- School today?
- No,I have work.

53
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:39,158
Ah,right. Your uniform's
clean. It's hanging up.

54
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,995
May I help you?

55
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:45,338
- Señora Alvarez?

56
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:46,989
No,it's Andres.

57
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:49,244
- You must have the wrong...
- Rafael Castillo.

58
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:51,672
We spoke on the telephone.

59
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,406
- How was Dallas?
- It was good.

60
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:00,923
Saw the kid?

61
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:04,022
- Oh, yeah, first time in eight years.
- Nice.

62
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:05,788
Tell Sophie I'm sorry, all right?

63
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:06,757
For what?

64
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:09,195
Extra-long shift.

65
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:11,997
What? I thought tonight was
your biannual date night.

66
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,762
She knows the drill;
we've been married 15 years.

67
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:16,862
Lots of time for date night
when I'm old and feeble.

68
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,014
What,like me?

69
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,175
Buddy,my
understanding--

70
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:21,478
you have to have a, a date before
you can blow off date night.

71
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:23,906
- Oh, that.
- I'm just saying.

72
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,475
Alandra.

73
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,342
You sold your car?

74
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:12,133
It cost, like, half a paycheck to fill up,
which is the same price as a secondhand bike.

75
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:14,628
Ooh, watch out: Sam's
packing three speeds.

76
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:15,942
Why not?

77
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:21,988
At work, it's all zero to 60, it's all
madness and bad guys and go, go, go, hair on fire.

78
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:24,281
Okay,I get it, so then going to work...

79
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,007
- I take my time... take it slow...
- Nice.

80
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:29,723
try to remember that
people are generally nice.

81
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:32,371
So, uh, what about, uh, the ladies?

82
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:34,981
You know, picking 'em up, taking
'em out, night on the town.

83
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:37,505
You going to do all that on a bike?

84
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:38,695
Excuse me.

85
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,365
You told me not to overpack.

86
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:43,263
I simply suggested we
experiment in traveling light.

87
00:05:43,282 --> 00:05:45,614
Which is fine, except now you
want me to wear the Dior tonight.

88
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:47,005
And guess what? It's at home.

89
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,848
You're going to look beautiful.
Doesn't matter what you wear.

90
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,028
Hell, wear the bathrobe.

91
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:52,226
Sexiest thing a woman ever put on.

92
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:53,732
What do you think?

93
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:55,642
- Oh, I agree.
- See, Ed agrees.

94
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:58,463
- Liked him from the moment I met him.
- Poor Ed.

95
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,584
Sir, I'll double-check this stuff.

96
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,206
Of course, whatever you need to do.

97
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:04,720
This is her traveling light.

98
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,707
And mineral water. Absolutely.

99
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,847
Thank you, Ms. Gagnon.

100
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:21,715
Danny, 313, 314, I'm gonna
take this one up myself.

101
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,427
Hey, boss.

102
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,356
- Thanks, Jules.
- No sugar.

103
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:36,263
1:23 P.M. Knock on the
door. Brace yourselves.

104
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,988
Looks like room service.

105
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,837
What?

106
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:45,447
Just haven't seen you in a suit before.

107
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,942
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

108
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,619
Can we get a little focus going here?

109
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:54,851
Uh, sweetheart?

110
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,755
No, you are not having the steak frites for
lunch because we had steak last night for dinner.

111
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:02,826
- Thank you very much, my dear, perfect.
- Thank you.

112
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:05,138
It's a nice choice.

113
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,607
My wife says the same thing.

114
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:09,533
A little omega-3 and the crossword
if you want to live to be 70.

115
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,980
She's aiming for a hundred.

116
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,337
14 years she's been taking care of me, and
ever since I met her, everything's better.

117
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:20,454
It's usually steamed,
but it's still better.

118
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,061
I'm coming down for the package.

119
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:52,448
<font color=#00FFFF>Lara.Croft @ Kaskus.us

120
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,049
<font color=#00FFFF>Flashpoint
Season 02 Episode 01</font>

121
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:24,221
Eagle One, Eagle Two on the move.

122
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:26,505
Was this on the itinerary?

123
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,405
Get the feeling this guy
doesn't like itineraries.

124
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,296
Check Eagle Two, it's on hers.

125
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,081
Yeah, but not for half an hour.

126
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,412
4:00 P.M.: interview with
a journalist, library bar.

127
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:36,907
Eagle One suggested they go down
early for a glass of champagne.

128
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,433
Aw, what a guy.

129
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:40,756
All right, hold on. Hold
the elevator. I'm on my way.

130
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:42,579
You got our team on all the exits?

131
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,932
We do.

132
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:48,577
"3:34 P.M.: Eagle One breaks from
itinerary, mark as unpredictable."

133
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,812
So what does your wife
think of all of this?

134
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,935
All of what?

135
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,442
Well, it's a dangerous job you do.

136
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,879
I mean, now, knock on
wood, not tonight, but...

137
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:58,355
- Right, well, she's okay with it.
- Really?

138
00:08:58,365 --> 00:08:59,785
Is she a police officer as well?

139
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:03,326
No, she's a caterer. This
is Jules; she's with us.

140
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:26,501
Spike, there's an unmarked exit
just opposite the front desk.

141
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,956
- "Staff only"?
- That's the one.

142
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,182
Sarge, I'm not liking the bar.

143
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:35,694
Three exits-- one to the street,
one to the lobby, one towards the kitchen.

144
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,604
Corridors running east, west, up, down.

145
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:39,514
Yeah, we've closed off
access to the street.

146
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:41,558
We're about to have
Jules on the lobby door.

147
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,794
Copy that. Be there in two.

148
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:45,406
Okay, so the bar's a little soft.

149
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:47,210
What's the closest lobby exit?

150
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,244
- South.
- Wordy?

151
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,336
Outside's clear. Heading in.

152
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:53,793
Okay, just stay on it.

153
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,750
Eagle One-- he likes
to wander off-course.

154
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,562
I'll take the front exit when they
get here, and I think we're good.

155
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,942
Ready for anything.

156
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:12,448
We'll be gone by 8:00.
Our suite's already paid for.

157
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,849
Why don't you bring your
wife in for the night?

158
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:15,528
Fridge full of champagne, room service.

159
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:16,392
Lovely idea.

160
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:19,108
- Very kind,very kind,but I...
- Can't take favors. I get it.

161
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:21,373
One of the ironies of having
money-- everything costs less.

162
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:23,493
I'll get you my corporate rate.
It's practically free.

163
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:26,267
Sir, you know, you're very generous
with the rest of the world.

164
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:28,263
- I just wouldn't feel comfortable...
- Ed,Ed,word to the wise.

165
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:29,501
Don't try and fight him on this.

166
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,735
Let me guess. You don't have
enough time. Tough job,long hours.

167
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:36,381
You're great at what you do, Ed, but
I got a few years on you. Trust me.

168
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:40,392
One thing money can't
buy is enough time.

169
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:42,600
Say yes. Call your wife.

170
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:46,476
It's a wonderful idea. Surprise her.
Give her a call. Come on, go ahead.

171
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,492
Okay. Okay.

172
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:51,265
I still remember the night
you flew me to Santiago.

173
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,578
He said it was a surprise,
told me to pack for two nights.

174
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,547
She packed for two weeks.

175
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,562
Hotel balcony. He asked me to marry him.

176
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,424
He said he was leaving
the mining industry behind.

177
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:00,545
I was working for the
Foreign Service at the time.

178
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:04,306
We had known each other
a whole entire month.

179
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,178
I will tell you what sold me on it.

180
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:10,515
He looked at me, and he said, "I'm finally
gonna do something good with my life."

181
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:13,759
That's what he said. And he was holding
out a ring. I mean, what was I gonna say?

182
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:15,476
Is she not there?

183
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:18,586
No. No, she didn't,uh...
She didn't answer.

184
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,305
Okay. Mrs. Graham is
waiting at her table.

185
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:26,253
Thank you.

186
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:31,176
SeÃ±or Castillo. Lovely to meet you.

187
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:32,145
Nice to meet you.

188
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:34,573
Hello. I'll see you in the room, darling.

189
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,279
Yes. Please, sit, sit.

190
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,931
Eyes on Two.

191
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:46,492
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

192
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:48,910
Hey, did you just call?

193
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,052
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.

194
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:52,892
Do you know where that cheese shop is?
You know the new one. It's got the, um...

195
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:55,109
- Cheese?
- You should know. You ate it all.

196
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,374
Anyway, I'm having Amy over
tonight since you're working late.

197
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,406
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I
think I can get us a suite tonight.

198
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:02,940
You're working at the Royal York, right?

199
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:04,369
Ed, we can't afford the Royal York.

200
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:05,982
Think I can get us a deal.

201
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,143
You can't make it, you can't make it.

202
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:09,273
Are you kidding? Room service.

203
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:10,818
Date night alone with my husband.

204
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:13,227
Champagne, fresh sheets. What time?

205
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,541
What about Amy?

206
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:17,430
Ah, she can eat someone else's cheese.

207
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,322
Clark?

208
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:21,403
I'll get my mother to come over. 6:00?

209
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:25,069
- Okay, yeah. I might be a little bit late, but, uh...
- Jay?

210
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,228
you know, we're gonna finish things
up here, and, uh, that should be good.

211
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:29,857
Okay. I'll start the champagne
and the bubble bath without you.

212
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,325
- See you then.
- See you then.

213
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,465
Nice work. Jay, nice to see you again.

214
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:36,949
Listen, I'm gonna need a suite for tonight
at my corporate rate, but it's not for me.

215
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:41,171
Of course. We've got a lovely
suite available on the fourth floor.

216
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:42,697
We'll get it ready for you right now.

217
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:45,000
Always happy to have a friend...

218
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:47,629
Sir, we got to move.

219
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:53,330
Stay here. I'll be right back.

220
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:09,547
Explosion, kitchen oven. Get a medic
in here. May have some injuries.

221
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,177
Oh, my God.

222
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:15,612
The woman and the journalist sitting at
this table-- did anybody see them leave?

223
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,474
Jules, what's going on?

224
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:20,650
Eagle Two. Ed, she's not here.

225
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,790
I'm gonna check the bathroom.

226
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:24,220
What do you mean, not here?

227
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,168
What's going on?
Where the hell is my wife?

228
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:28,500
Hey, Spike, bomb truck.
Figure out what happened.

229
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,928
Lewis, Wordy, get security
to lock it all down.

230
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,567
All exits, temporary red alert.

231
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:39,545
Jules, channel two.

232
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,244
All right, Jules, talk to me.

233
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:44,487
I turned my head for three seconds,
trying to figure out where to take her.

234
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:46,829
Journalist is also missing.
Possible subject.

235
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:52,203
I repeat, Team One, Eagle Two is MIA.
I have no contact with her.

236
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:55,206
Stairwell's clear. Lobby's clear.

237
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:56,617
Tell me what is going on.

238
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,855
Sir, I'll keep you up to date.

239
00:13:57,874 --> 00:14:00,005
You're telling me that my wife is
missing, and you'll keep me up to date?

240
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,079
What the hell is happening here?

241
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,701
Sir, please, I need you to stay calm.

242
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:03,603
And I need you to stay here.

243
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:05,004
It's got to be about money,right?

244
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,645
We'll get a ransom note
in about a half an hour.

245
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:07,634
We don't know that.

246
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:09,649
- Well, I know that.
- Sir, please.

247
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,297
Cut off gas supply to this
kitchen now and ventilate--

248
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:14,956
fans, windows, everything--
before anything else blows.

249
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,020
Let's see why this thing
didn't take the roof off.

250
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:30,358
Hey, there's no sign of Eagle
Two leaving the building.

251
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:33,188
As far as we can tell, she's...

252
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,161
She's still within the perimeter.
As far as the journalist...

253
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:39,349
He was fully accredited
with the Millennium Forum.

254
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,410
Unless he's a master of forgery,
he writes for a small Chilean publication.

255
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,023
His name is Rafael Castillo.

256
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:46,796
Excuse me. What are you saying?

257
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:49,387
I'm saying we may be
looking at a kidnapping.

258
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,554
Good news is, if so,
she's being held within the building.

259
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:53,878
That's the good news?

260
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,673
Sarge, we got guys at every exit.

261
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:56,843
That's good. Cover Spike.

262
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:59,501
Ask around, and just wait for my orders.

263
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,641
Okay, let's break it down, do the math.

264
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,100
800 rooms, divided by five...

265
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,209
No. Excuse me. 809,actually.

266
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,224
It's 160 rooms per person.

267
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,767
Kira, get Rolie.
We need Team Three here ASAP.

268
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:42,080
Even if we cut these numbers in half,
we're talking 80 rooms each.

269
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:43,184
No. Absolutely not.

270
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:48,279
We have 532 guests already checked in,
27 of whom are VIPs.

271
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:49,815
We cannot invade their privacy.

272
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:53,116
- This is their home away from home.
- Jay! Jay! Jay! Jay!

273
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,131
I've got one job.
That's protect the principal.

274
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:58,269
Principal's wife goes missing,
that affects the principal.

275
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:00,419
See, you, on the other
hand, have two jobs.

276
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:03,681
Get my guys some master
keys, and get a grip.

277
00:16:06,378 --> 00:16:07,856
I don't know. I was on the phone.

278
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:10,792
I was talking to my mother, and
then I heard that thing go off.

279
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:13,757
It's okay. It's okay. We're
just... We're trying to make sure.

280
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:18,172
Uh, did you see any strangers,
any guests in the staff areas?

281
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:20,859
Well, Claudia, if you hear anything,
if you see anything,

282
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,864
you come speak to one of us, all right?

283
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:25,292
Uh, you said your shift's
over at 5:00. Is that right?

284
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,413
Security's gonna show
you out the staff door.

285
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:29,918
Just show 'em your ID.

286
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:38,142
Police! Strategic Response Unit!
Anyone there?

287
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,959
Security. Is there anyone in there?

288
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:48,131
Police! Strategic Response Unit!
Is anybody in there?

289
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,701
Good. I'm glad I caught you.
You haven't left yet.

290
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,397
Yeah, I know. I'm just getting
ready. What do you need?

291
00:16:59,407 --> 00:17:01,576
Soph, we can't do it tonight. I...

292
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:04,157
We're having a serious
security problem here.

293
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,247
Okay. Are you all right?

294
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:09,464
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

295
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:12,573
That's okay.
I'll see you when you get home.

296
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:18,072
Well, Ed, when I was still in ming,
I took over a company in Venezuela.

297
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:20,135
Hostile. Got very ugly,

298
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:26,584
but, Ed, you don't become what
I am by being nice to everyone.

299
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:28,733
But, I mean, this was all years ago.

300
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,113
Well, let me ask you this.
Could your wife be involved in something?

301
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:33,282
Something that you don't know about?

302
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,642
I... I don't know.

303
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:40,537
I don't think so, but I suppose you
never really know anyone completely.

304
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:43,108
Sarge, Ed, I don't like it.

305
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:46,611
I got wires. I got a fuse.
Explosives 101, nothing fancy.

306
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,434
You could learn this
stuff in high school.

307
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:50,776
But it's a bomb. It's definitely a bomb.

308
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:53,933
Wasn't built to kill, but it
sure was a hell of a distraction.

309
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:59,105
Do you know why you're here?

310
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:02,310
No. Money, I guess. I don't know.

311
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,279
Ramon Castillo, Gabriel
Alvarez, Diego Garcia.

312
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:11,600
Three men who were
loved by their families.

313
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:15,669
Tell her. Tell her!

314
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:26,157
My father-- his name
was Gabriel Alvarez.

315
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,211
We lived in Falpago, Chile.

316
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,483
The last time I saw him, he
was standing on our doorway.

317
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:34,928
He was making my mother
laugh, even as she was crying.

318
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:39,026
He was fighting for our
village, to make things right.

319
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,327
But it didn't work. They took him away.

320
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:45,954
They humiliated him.
They tortured him.

321
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,390
He disappeared.

322
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,365
I never knew what happened to him.

323
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:56,117
I'm sorry. I am. But...

324
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,629
I don't understand what
this has to do with me.

325
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,855
Don't! She can't bring them back.

326
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:35,337
SeÃ±or Castillo... please.

327
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,104
I'll explain how it works.

328
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:49,299
Sarge? This freight elevator
hasn't moved in 20 minutes.

329
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,084
It's worth a shot.

330
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:53,704
Jules, we've got a frozen cargo
elevator in the east wing.

331
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:54,990
Might be worth a look.

332
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,677
- Send Lewis, too.
- Copy that.

333
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,303
Sarge, she's here.
We got her.

334
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:29,220
But we've got a problem.

335
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:37,002
- Please stand back. Stand back.
- Okay.

336
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:43,019
They called it a necklace bomb.

337
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,209
Civilians coming through. Let them out.
That's the last of them.

338
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,618
No, sir, no, sir, Inspector.

339
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,305
They told her, anyone tampers with
it, anyone tries to isolate her,

340
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:58,354
get her out of the building, they trigger
the blasting cap and sever her spine.

341
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,945
I don't know, I...
I don't know.

342
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,653
They also told her it was
fitted out with a camera.

343
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:04,093
We can't take that chance.

344
00:21:04,102 --> 00:21:06,972
Boss, that's it. Everyone's out.
The floor's secure.

345
00:21:08,027 --> 00:21:09,985
Three different triggers.

346
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,729
Mercury switch, pressure fit,
and a remote.

347
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,071
Now, if we can disable the remote,
we can deal with everything else.

348
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,719
And sir, if you've got any ideas...

349
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,666
All right, we'll see
you in a bit. Thank you.

350
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,230
Where is she?

351
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,830
She's safe. She's doing well,
but we need you to stay back.

352
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,037
If you are gonna be down
here, you're here to help us,

353
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:29,734
and you need to stay back
until further notice,sir.

354
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:31,308
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

355
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:33,352
- Okay, come on, Eddie.
- Wordy.

356
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,540
- We'll be back.
- Sir.

357
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:39,714
Spike says he can't cut it until
he knows what's triggering it.

358
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:41,691
Plus, they told her there's a camera.

359
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,791
They'd hit play if
anyone tries to cut it.

360
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:48,303
- We got to get them in bomb gear.
- I know. They both said no.

361
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,600
You're gonna be fine.

362
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:54,915
- We're all here with you,okay?
- Okay.

363
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:58,110
Guys,I need ten seconds
of complete silence, okay?

364
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,868
If she's safe,I don't
understand why I can't go in.

365
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,461
Sir, it's for your own safety.

366
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:06,584
How is she a threat?

367
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,273
It's not her, sir.

368
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:13,522
They've got her in a necklace bomb.

369
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:14,779
Oh, my God.

370
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:16,295
You've heard of these things?

371
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:18,915
I lived in South America for eight
years. Yes, I've heard of them.

372
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:23,041
Oh,dear God, please. Just say yes.
Say yes to however much they want.

373
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,153
They don't want money.

374
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:26,889
What do they want?

375
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:29,068
You didn't see her? You
didn't see the woman who spoke?

376
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:32,599
No. By then,I was blindfolded,
so apart from the journalist...

377
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:33,991
There was nobody else in there?

378
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,975
I don't know. Castillo was the
one who gave me the instructions.

379
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:39,307
Can you give them to me again?

380
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,376
I am to go to the
opening address at 7:00.

381
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:44,710
I don't even know what time it is now.

382
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:47,435
No alarms, no changes,
no alerting the other guests.

383
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:50,189
You can't be serious.
That's 20 minutes from now.

384
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:55,582
In front of the room, in front of everyone,
my husband is to confess.

385
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:57,079
Confess to what?

386
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,949
To something about
his mining operations.

387
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,279
Something about a man
named Gabriel Alvarez.

388
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:05,927
Gabriel Alvarez.

389
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:09,401
If you tell the truth,
your wife will live.

390
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:12,472
Now, that's what they told her.

391
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,562
Any of this make any sense to you?

392
00:23:20,763 --> 00:23:22,231
Let me see her.

393
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:25,033
- Okay, go. Quickly.
- Okay.

394
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:38,650
I love you.

395
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:47,201
- This is too much.
- No, it's too late.

396
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,552
There's no time to debate this, Claudia.

397
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,625
You cannot back out on us now.

398
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:54,887
The world needs to
know what this man did.

399
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:00,165
So, I give this to Felipe in the room...

400
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:01,729
and then I can go, right?

401
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:03,284
Unless I don't make it in.

402
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:04,580
Why wouldn't you?

403
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:07,497
Security is going to be very tight.

404
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:10,433
Listen, if I don't make it in,

405
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:14,790
and if Graham lies to us,
to the room, you press...

406
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:18,254
this button. Okay?

407
00:24:18,264 --> 00:24:24,252
But,Claudia, if the man apologizes to us,
to everyone, nothing happens.

408
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:26,488
We let her go.

409
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:29,396
- You promise?
- Of course.

410
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:35,460
Okay.

411
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:40,969
Thank you. Claudia, your father...

412
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:43,636
this... this is what he would do.

413
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:46,131
Does it have a camera?

414
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,223
I can't tell until we pull it apart.

415
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:49,548
Is she safe to walk around?

416
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,678
I need a minute to develop the X-ray,
but as far as I can tell,

417
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:53,952
there's no embedded motion
sensor, no timing device.

418
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:55,718
- So, it needs to be triggered?
- Yeah.

419
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:59,211
Found a small amount of TNT, and there's
a blasting cap attached to a relay switch.

420
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:01,706
Could be set off by cell phone,
could be set off by shortwave remote.

421
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:02,282
Okay, meaning?

422
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,324
Meaning, they're either gonna call it in or
they're gonna be within the line of sight.

423
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:06,428
Probably within 30 feet.

424
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,733
What about the people around her?

425
00:25:07,752 --> 00:25:09,642
It's a blasting cap. It
goes off, it breaks her neck.

426
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:13,078
She's done,but it's not gonna hurt anybody
else within five, ten feet, I'm guessing.

427
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:14,277
Okay, we'll put her up in the balcony.

428
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:15,995
Meets the demands, but
keeps her out of the way.

429
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,857
That's the best we can
do right now. Let me know.

430
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:19,757
All right.

431
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:24,344
There is no guests or staff
members with the last name Alvarez.

432
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:28,768
And beyond Graham giving a public confession
during his keynote speech in front of the press,

433
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:32,107
in front of the world, we don't know
what these people want or who they are.

434
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,383
What the hell did this guy do?

435
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:35,072
His past life, in his
sleep-- I don't care.

436
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:36,157
The wife doesn't even know,sir.

437
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:38,450
They told her that he would
understand what it was about.

438
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,909
No, we can't risk it.

439
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:42,682
60 people having drinks, and we're
gonna put a woman in the middle of that?

440
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:44,755
We keep her up in the
balcony, out of the way.

441
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:46,482
Having her in the room
is part of the demand.

442
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:48,296
I don't care.

443
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:51,914
This guy says one wrong word, we've got a
woman being executed at a public function.

444
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:53,833
Sir, either way, they're gonna kill her.

445
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:57,739
They're not asking for money or hostages or
concessions, which means it's like war, right?

446
00:25:57,748 --> 00:25:59,639
They're making a point.They're
making it publicly,

447
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,376
and they want him to see
what happens to his wife...

448
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,439
Not if we stop it.

449
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:06,644
We've got 14 minutes. We don't
have time to do anything else.

450
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:10,588
- All right.
- Go, Sam.

451
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,715
We follow their
instructions to the letter.

452
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:16,384
Eagle One and Eagle
Two go into the party.

453
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:18,304
Eagle One does his thing, as instructed.

454
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:20,405
In the meantime...

455
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:24,292
Spike is working on
electronic countermeasures,

456
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:26,816
jamming all cell phone signals
within a 100-meter radius.

457
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:28,351
No calls in, no calls out.

458
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,548
Don't tell me this thing can
be set off by a cell phone.

459
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:32,391
Not anymore.

460
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:36,191
The only other possible trigger
is shortwave remote, like a pager.

461
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:36,997
What does that mean?

462
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:41,200
That the subject has to be within the
line of sight, 30 feet from Eagle Two.

463
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,883
We contain the room. Sam prepares
a less lethal solution because,

464
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:48,983
if the weapon is a garage door
opener, we can't take that chance.

465
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:51,334
We cannot shoot to kill.

466
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,576
We contain the room; the
subject's already arrested.

467
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,472
All right, Greg.

468
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,466
I'd like to talk to my husband,please.

469
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:08,252
Sweetheart.

470
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:10,527
This isn't happening, okay?

471
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,810
It's just another night.

472
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,018
It's just me and you.

473
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:18,635
You get up there and you tell the
truth, and we go home together.

474
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:25,401
David... please.

475
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:29,671
You can't get up there and lie.

476
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,702
You can't try and save me by
confessing to something you didn't do,

477
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:38,577
'cause what you have built,
what we've built together,

478
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:42,300
if we let them destroy it
like this, it will never end.

479
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:47,539
I'll see you in there?

480
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:50,629
Yes. I will see you in there.

481
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:55,658
I lo you.

482
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:59,573
With all my heart.

483
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,231
Sierra One in position.

484
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,680
Copy that.

485
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,771
Ed?

486
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:27,805
- We're on our way.
- Copy.

487
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:34,686
Okay. Let's keep the peace.

488
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,306
Boss, what did this guy do?

489
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:03,849
I don't know.

490
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:05,106
Eagle One approaching.

491
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:07,448
Got to be something I can
do, uh, somebody I can pay.

492
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:09,415
Just buy us a little time to do our job.

493
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:12,457
Longer you talk,the
better. Left here, sir.

494
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:17,975
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Jane Renn.

495
00:29:17,994 --> 00:29:19,865
I'm with the Millennium Forum.

496
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,679
I'd like to welcome you tonight,

497
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:24,903
and thank you for braving the
increased security this evening.

498
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:29,596
It's my pleasure to invite tonight's
speaker to join us: David Graham.

499
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,120
He needs no introduction.

500
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:34,317
Thank you very much.

501
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:41,083
Eagle Two, we're in position.

502
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:42,704
Copy that.

503
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:46,831
I...

504
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:51,763
don't know what to say.

505
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:57,252
nored tonight in this way,

506
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:01,369
I wish I deserved it. I do.

507
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:05,400
I wish that more than anything.

508
00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:13,105
The nonprofit work we've done in South
America is the work I'm most proud of.

509
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:15,495
- Jules,any sign of the journalist?
- Negative.

510
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:19,045
It all began, of course,
as an idea of Catherine's.

511
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:22,404
Everything does--
everything good.

512
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,847
15 years ago, we sat on
a balcony in Santiago,

513
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,024
and I promised Catherine I would
do something good with my life,

514
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:33,075
if only she would just stay with me.

515
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,574
Magically... she agreed.

516
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:42,528
And since that night,
I've never looked back.

517
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:46,193
Because if I did, if I did...

518
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:51,001
look back, I would see things
I can't believe I let happen.

519
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:57,824
I would see ghosts. Faces.

520
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,758
Ramon Castillo.

521
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,637
Diego Garcia.

522
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:09,263
Gabriel Alvarez.

523
00:31:09,723 --> 00:31:13,408
Gabriel Alvarez mounted
a citizen's blockade.

524
00:31:13,437 --> 00:31:15,903
My copper mine in Huaron,

525
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:20,692
a very effective and
very expensive blockade.

526
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:21,795
Her shift is over.

527
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:23,839
That waitress, her
shift is done at 5:00.

528
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:25,423
Copy that.

529
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:28,484
Quadrant Three, possible subject,
waitress, black hair.

530
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:30,749
I was approached.

531
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:35,892
I was told if you cut the head,
the body falls.

532
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:43,704
I said "Yes, "take care of him."

533
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:47,677
Two days later, the blockade was gone,

534
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:51,410
and I didn't ask any questions.

535
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:57,139
I am responsible for the death

536
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,229
of Gabriel Alvarez.

537
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:05,794
I said "Yes."

538
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:13,548
Yes is the easiest word.

539
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,262
Yes, I love you.

540
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:21,868
Yes, I will marry you.

541
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:27,626
Yes, get rid of the problem.

542
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:34,151
What you don't know is that
saying yes stays with you forever.

543
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:40,399
The violence you do. These choices.

544
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:44,477
Quadrant Three, male black suit
approaching possible subject.

545
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:49,198
I am sorry. I am...

546
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:52,106
so sorry.

547
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,436
- No,no,no!
- Sam, tell me you got the solution.

548
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,451
I've got it.

549
00:32:57,461 --> 00:32:58,420
Go, go, go, go..

550
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:12,834
Now? Dead. Definitely dead.

551
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:15,444
Okay, can we keep cell signals blocked
until we get this thing is off?

552
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:16,644
Done.

553
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:18,054
- Mezzanine clear?
- Mezzanine clear.

554
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:21,605
Jules, up in the mezzanine,
Spike's gonna meet you up there.

555
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,467
Copy that.

556
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:29,128
I don't think so.

557
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,084
- Okay, it's time.
- Okay.

558
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,351
Okay...

559
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:38,888
Okay.

560
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:46,277
- All right?
- Yep.

561
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:48,398
- You're going to take this thing off?
- That's right.

562
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:50,423
- Where's your gear?
- It's all right here.

563
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:52,399
No, I mean don't you have a
protective suit or something?

564
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:54,664
- No, I don't need one.
- Please.

565
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:56,545
We're going to be just fine.

566
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:00,451
- Okay.
- Okay.

567
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,153
Boss, we got the journalist.

568
00:34:10,162 --> 00:34:13,281
He tried to exit the staff door.
One of the uniforms recognized him.

569
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:21,639
I should have told her.

570
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:24,470
I'm not here to judge.

571
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,812
I was trying to protect her.

572
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:28,769
So were we.

573
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:08,978
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

574
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:10,542
Thank you.

575
00:35:19,754 --> 00:35:22,422
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Okay.

576
00:35:22,432 --> 00:35:23,698
Thank you.

577
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:26,644
- Excuse me, Mrs. Graham?
- Yes.

578
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:28,573
Go ahead. State your name and address.

579
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:32,095
My name is Claudia Andres.

580
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:36,327
I live at 267 Cressyoad, in North York.

581
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:39,590
I am a waitress in this hotel.

582
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:42,718
I'm really sorry about
what happened tonight.

583
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,290
Mrs. Graham, can you identify this woman?

584
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,747
Her face, her voice?

585
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,226
Yes. Yes, I can.

586
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:57,093
She served us lunch today.

587
00:36:02,103 --> 00:36:03,916
Okay, thank you.

588
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:05,701
Wordy, let's bring her to the VIP guys.

589
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:08,100
Get her processed as
a possible accessory.

590
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,077
Copy that.

591
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:17,294
Catherine, I'm sorry.

592
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:20,230
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't you... don't you apologize!

593
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,776
Sir, they're going to need
a few minutes to debrief.

594
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:33,454
Right, of course.

595
00:36:34,116 --> 00:36:36,333
- I got to go.
- Okay.

596
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:39,260
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

597
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,259
Thank you.

598
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,535
8:27 P.M.: incident contained.

599
00:36:55,544 --> 00:36:58,299
Two arrests. VIP secured.

600
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:01,245
That was a long day.

601
00:37:01,724 --> 00:37:05,361
If it's okay with you,
all right, debrief tomorrow.

602
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:06,561
Yeah.

603
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,432
Sam, Spike...

604
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:12,031
good job, everybody. Good job.

605
00:37:13,384 --> 00:37:14,890
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

606
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,819
Date night.

607
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:20,140
- All right. See you tomorrow.
- All right.

608
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:51,020
Hey, Jules!

609
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:55,061
- Hey, it wasn't your fault.
- Yeah,I know.

610
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,508
So, why are you leaving? We got
the truck. I'll take you back.

611
00:37:57,517 --> 00:37:59,101
Can you just take it back to HQ?

612
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,317
I'm really close to my house.
I just want to walk.

613
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:03,035
- Fine, I'll drive you home.
- Sam!

614
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:04,657
- What?
- Okay, stop, all right?

615
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:05,943
I don't need you to be
nice to me right now.

616
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:08,332
I don't need you to rescue
me or be the big hero.

617
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:11,806
I just... I need a minute alone.

618
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,934
You think I feel sorry for you?

619
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:17,516
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard. Let's go.

620
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:19,205
Jules, I'm driving you home.

621
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,556
I promise you don't even need to talk.

622
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,060
No, I just...

623
00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:41,094
Soph?

624
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:43,061
What are you doing?

625
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,710
Date night. It's a good book.

626
00:38:56,697 --> 00:38:59,039
- You mad?
- No.

627
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,346
- Sure?
- I'm sure.

628
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,408
So, did you save anybody today?

629
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,500
Kinda did. Yeah.

630
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:30,000
