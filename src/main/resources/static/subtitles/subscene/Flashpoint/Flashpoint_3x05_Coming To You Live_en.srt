00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,510
You're with pat "the lion" cosgrove,this is cosgrove in the morning.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,540
And,folks,today is a very,very special day

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,600
because today is the day that we get to learn all about the real ryan malone.

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,330
Have you been a politician for so long that you've forgotten how to tell the truth?

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,770
I am not gonna lie just to tell you what you wanna hear.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,490
Are you ready to die,ryan?

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,470
****

8
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,930
- Pat.
- Hey,dave.

9
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,790
You see the bbm's for last week?

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,400
Impressive,as always.

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,030
Yeah,well,number one in my time slot.As always.

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,990
Pat,no one's ever doubted your ability to bring in the numbers.

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,750
Any coffee in there?

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,620
Keep your ears open,dave.

15
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,370
It's gonna be a big one today.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,680
Gonna be a very big one.

17
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,090
Wo you know cosgrove's not gonna stick to the issues,right?

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,700
Well,he gave us his word,nicole.

19
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,050
Have you been listening to him lately?

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,550
He's been going after you,like you're...

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,810
Public enemy number one.

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,800
That's his job,that's what people want him to do.

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,860
Well,i still don't think this is a good idea.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,300
Well,if he wants to tussle with me,i say bring it on,i've got a job to do.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,950
Okay,you're the councilman.

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,390
- We cool?
- Yes.

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,340
It's okay,it's radio.

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,940
I'm going back to the office,i'll pick you up when you're done.

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,660
Good.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,810
I'll be listening.

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,890
Hi,i'm ryan malone,pleased to meet you.

32
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,500
Late night?

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,450
Yeah,you could say that.

34
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,930
Blonde,brunette or redhead?

35
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,700
One of each.

36
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,380
Didn't know you had the stamina.

37
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,930
Rock'n'roll stations only,wordy.

38
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,880
None of this country and western stuff,come on.

39
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,170
I'm putting on cosgrove.

40
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,670
We're working out,can we please have something with a beat?

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,590
You've obviously never heard cosgrove.

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,560
you're with pat "the lion" cosgrove,this is cosgrove in the morning

43
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,790
and i am joined here in the studio this morning by my guest,councilman ryan malone.

44
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,580
It's,uh,my pleasure to be here,pat.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,750
Well,we are very,very lucky to have you here.

46
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,450
Although i have to say,ryan,it has taken us a lot of work to get you on my little show.

47
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,230
I'd hardly call your show little,pat.Uh,you're an institution in this town.

48
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh,pat cosgrove an institution?

49
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,140
Well,i don't know about that,

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,450
but i there are definitely some people who probably feel that i belong in one.

51
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,180
I just can't stand this guy.

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
I know,his teeth are too white,huh?

53
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,450
No,no,i'm talking about cosgrove.

54
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,420
I'm talking about cosgrove.

55
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,000
Malone wants to put 100 cops on the street,jules.

56
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,940
100 cops.He gets my vote every time.

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,290
And the minute he gets his hands on the budget,

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,180
he starts running those red lines through all the promises he made.

59
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,800
Yeah,well,you gotta have a little faith,boss.A little faith.

60
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,800
But i'm a realist,buddy,like cosgrove.

61
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,170
I calls 'em like i sees 'em.

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,580
oh,come on,ryan,let's get real here,all right?

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,210
Wealthy land baron,terry malone -

64
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,810
And yes,folks,my guest is that malone -

65
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,950
Has been financing your campaign from the get-Go.

66
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,380
Look,my books are wide open.

67
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,200
So,instead of manipulating facts and trying to play "tempest in a teapot,"

68
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,070
why don't we give your listeners a little bit more credit.

69
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,090
Because i came here today because i wanted to talk issues.

70
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,150
Important...Ehics,you know...

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,050
Ethics is an issue,you know?Especially for you,ryan.

72
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,420
Okay,so you're just gonna lob vague insults at me,pat?

73
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,180
Is that the best that you can do?

74
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,340
Oh well,don't you worry,we'll be gettin' into specifics soon enough.

75
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,680
You're with pat "the lion" cosgrove and this morning,

76
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,500
listeners,we have something a little different.

77
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,760
Because this morning we are gonna be putting councilman ryan malone on trial.

78
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,440
Yes,on trial,for his great and multitudinous sins.

79
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,050
Okay,well,this is a new low,even for you,pat.

80
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,800
Because today,folks,is judgment day.

81
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,050
Today,ryan,we're gonna be dragging all your skeletons from the closet

82
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,130
and once we are through here today then you also will be through.

83
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,050
Smells a little bit like bourbon in here to me,pat.

84
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,100
Oh,that was...

85
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,310
Are you gonna lecture me on my bad habits

86
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,780
when you gotta whole pile of them over there all your own,councilman?

87
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,900
You know what,pat,i think,uh...I think we're through.

88
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,090
Well,you know what,ryan?

89
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,210
I think don't think we've really gotten started,why don't you sit down?

90
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,350
I said sit...Down.

91
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,150
What the hell are you doing?

92
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,320
Well,i got a lot more questions for you.

93
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,690
Put that away.

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,830
Stay with us,folks,because you're with pat "the lion" cosgrove

95
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,190
and things here are about to get real interesting.

96
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,160
Oh,you gotta be kidding me.

97
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,310
Is that for real?

98
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,330
Let's not wait for a call.

99
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,960
You heard the boss,guys.Let's go,let's go,let's go!

100
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,590
Sru has arrived.They'll be on the way up in a minute.

101
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,720
Talk to me.

102
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,130
*****About 12 minutes ago.

103
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,310
They're still in studio?

104
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,700
Yeah,well,as far as we know they're on the second floor.

105
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,450
Radio station cprd.Shot was fired at 9:27 am.

106
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,870
Hi,i'm dave agostini,the station manager.

107
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,710
Nobody's gone into the studio,nobody's come out?

108
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,550
No.

109
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,300
- How many entrances?
- Uh,just the one door.

110
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,000
The technician's booth,on the other side.

111
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,880
Security cameras?

112
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,820
Not in studio.

113
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,030
Spike,we need blueprints,we find gotta find another way into that studio.

114
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,910
Tech's have a two-Way mic into the studio,

115
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,510
but he won't answer,i already told you.

116
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,020
Jules,take a look.

117
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,630
These blinds only open from the other side?

118
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,900
Pat?

119
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,400
This is sergeant greg parker,

120
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,480
i'm with the police strategic response unit,how're you doing?

121
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,110
Can you,can you hear me?

122
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,240
There's somebody in there.

123
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,320
What do you hear?

124
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,040
I heard labored breathing,but it's only one person.

125
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,380
One person?

126
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,050
Eddie,aggressive entry.

127
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,920
police!Police!

128
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,340
Police,don't move!

129
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,430
Police,do not move!

130
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,800
Sam?Got him.

131
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,780
Boss,get word to stainton,lock down the building.

132
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,960
We got something.

133
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,960
So,i take it you're the technician?

134
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,290
****

135
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,000
i don't know.

136
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,280
Bourbon before noon.

137
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,510
That a regular habit?

138
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,520
A little bit more recently,yeah.

139
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,810
Who fired the shot?

140
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,040
Was it cosgrove?

141
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,460
Yeah,but he didn't hit anyone.

142
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,700
What happened then?

143
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,850
It was just...

144
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,630
Like,in the interview,they were just talking,and then pat pulled a gun,

145
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,810
i ran in,and then he told malone to tie me up.

146
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,400
Anything else you can tell us.

147
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,690
He moved fast.

148
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
He kept watching the clock.

149
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,950
Did he say where he was going?

150
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,880
No.

151
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,410
No,only thing he said was that he was sorry.

152
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,470
i set up the interview with mr.Malone's assistant,nicole bennett.

153
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,140
She here?

154
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,770
mr.Malone came By himself.

155
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,820
spike,we need to find nicole bennett.She's ryan malone's assistant.

156
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,230
Hey,sarge,this is heather wallace,she cosgrove's producer.

157
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,520
She says she was in her office.

158
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,220
I came out as soon as i heard the shot.

159
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,740
And you never saw them leave?

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,650
No.

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,990
she couldn't have.

162
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,040
Usually cosgrove's on a 30 second tape delay.

163
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,180
Today he asked me to move it up to 6 minutes.

164
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,480
They were out of the building before anyone would've heard the shot.

165
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,990
You didn't think a 6 minute tape delay was a little odd?

166
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,290
I mean...Pat's show,you know,like,what he says...

167
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,290
For obvious reasons,i am unable to share with you the details of my location,

168
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,610
but i would like to say that i appreciate you listening.

169
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,380
My guest here today is councilman ryan malone...

170
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,900
- what's going on?
- I have no idea.

171
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,650
Well,ryan,why don't we start off by you sharing with the listeners

172
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,520
just what it is that i am holding in my hand here,right now?

173
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,650
He has a gun.

174
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
He is pointing a gun at me.

175
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,300
Yes,that is correct,i am.

176
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,460
And unless the councilman speaks the truth to me here today,

177
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,810
unless he does that,i will kill him.

181
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,140
Clear.

182
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,440
All the studios are cleared,boss.

183
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,530
Cosgrove is not broadcasting from this building.

184
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,330
Thanks,eddie.

185
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,230
On our way down.

186
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,690
Because,folks,today is a very,very special day

187
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,090
because today is the day that we get to learn all about the real ryan malone.

188
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,700
And you know what,folks,to be brutally honest with you,

189
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,300
there's really not a whole hell of a lot to the guy,

190
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,380
so it'll probably only take me,let's say around,uh...

191
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,620
What,like,an hour.

192
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,650
Oh,if in that hour,anyone attempts to shut down this signal,

193
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,700
or interfere with this broadcast

194
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,470
or interfere with my callers in any way whatsoever,

195
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,310
i will kill my guest.

196
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,890
Just so we're all loud and clear.

197
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,760
I certainly hope that we are...

198
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,510
Jules,you hear anything in the background?

199
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,950
What is it you want because i can see that you...

200
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,790
First of all,what i desperately want,ryan,

201
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,320
is for you not to try to handle me here,okay?

202
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,580
Because i've been doing this game here for 20 years now,

203
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,650
son,whatever that is worth,all right?

204
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,040
So do not try to handle me!

205
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,550
So where's cosgrove?

206
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,560
Okay,the shot was reported at 9:27.

207
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,470
Meaning it was fired at 9:21.

208
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,730
We arrived on the scene at 9:39,and cosgrove resumed broadcasting at 9:44.

209
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,070
So,23 minutes to get out of the building,drive wherever and get back on air.

210
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,900
Gotta be downtown.He's gotta be.

211
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay,spike,what do we got?

212
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,320
He's out there somewhere.

213
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,200
I just think we should talk this out...

214
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,890
That's a hell of a lot of haystack.

215
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,050
That's the station.That's cosgrove's house.

216
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,150
So he's gotta be broadcasting from his house.

217
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,230
You wanna check it out?

218
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,740
Copy that.Sam,wordy,let's move.

219
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,180
All right,you are on cosgrove in the morning.

220
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,150
Caller,go ahead...

221
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,100
pat?I can't believe i got through!

222
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,180
Yeah,you got through,caller.

223
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,130
Let's here it,what do you have to say about our guest today?

224
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,680
So how's he broadcasting in the first place?

225
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,540
He's hijacking the stations signal.

226
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,490
Yeah,but how's he doing that?

227
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,350
It's not that hard.

228
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,670
Transmitters,they all got a network card built into them,

229
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,440
all you need is a url and a password.He could be anywhere.

230
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,000
Can you trace the ip address?

231
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,410
I tried.He's using some kind of ip spoofer.

232
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,890
He's switching addresses every couple of seconds.

233
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,230
What we could do is cut him off by switching the station off

234
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,610
and stop him from piggybacking.

235
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,450
555-0190,that is the number.

236
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,220
And if you are listening,i want to hear...

237
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,150
All right,that's good to know.

238
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm gonna get some more intel,i'll be right back.

239
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,400
Okay,caller,you are on the air,you're on cosgrove in the morning.

240
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,350
oh man,pat,seriously,are you gonna waste this dude?

241
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,030
You know,let's just see how it all transpires over the next hour,caller,shall we?

242
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,140
Because,you know what?We've got so much to talk about here,

243
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:17,280
why don't just open up the proverbial closet here on my guest's distinguished career.

244
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,700
Skeleton number one...

245
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,800
If you can cut it out,why don't you?

246
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,060
'Cause if we interrupt that broadcast malone's as good as dead.

247
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,590
We need to use the time he's given us.

248
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,630
Okay,what i need from you is to help me understand what's going on with the man.

249
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,920
I should've never let him on the air,not his condition.

250
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,330
What,the drinking,you mean?

251
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,810
It's a regular occurrence?

252
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,850
No,not for years.

253
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,950
A few weeks ago,thoug he fell off the wagon prey hard.

254
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,330
Any particular reason?

255
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,680
Yeah,probab.

256
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,580
Look,a cole of months ago,

257
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,170
this statio and seven other affiliates got bought up by core channel.

258
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,780
I mean it happens all the time,but i'm guessing pat saw the wring on the wall.

259
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,510
No room for him in the new der,huh?

260
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,500
No,we're moving into music,entertainment,adult conmporary.

261
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,560
Today was his last shift.

262
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,800
He knew this?

263
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,400
No,i didn't tell him.

264
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,690
It's company policy.

265
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,600
Well,maybe he figured it out.

266
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,850
What is your take on councilman ryan malon or,you know what?

267
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,450
Or any othese fellas,really.

268
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,680
And you know the ones i mean,the ones with the pfect white teeth...

269
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,910
Guys,he'armed,he's inebriated...

270
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,460
And he's making a statement.

271
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,300
So long as he keeps talking,we got the element of surprise.

272
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,080
Stealth entry?

273
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,770
Low and slow.

274
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Wordy,you're one; sam,two; i'm three.Let's go.

275
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,260
What do you want?

276
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,590
What do i want?What i want,ryan malone,

277
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,360
ifor you just to know what it feels like.

278
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,850
What what feels like?

279
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,010
To be forgotten.

280
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,790
To be uh...

281
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,240
Left behind.

282
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,990
To be the one o did not get to take their rightful place.

283
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,770
Look...

284
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,490
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,830
Whatever it is you're going through,i can't imagine.

286
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,780
But,pat,m tied up...

287
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,230
- Yes.
- Nd you have a gun.

288
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,050
Yes,i do.

289
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,140
So,whateveit is you wanna hear...

290
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,280
What,you think i'm just gonna go ahead...

291
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,390
Don't insult me.

292
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,040
It had to be a good lck.

293
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,420
Make myself clear.

294
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,940
If councilman ryan malone does not speak the truth in the next 2 minutes...

295
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,230
All right,let's see if we can findsomething we can use,ys.

296
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,010
pat,i've listened to you for years,and this is not you.

297
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,980
well,what can i say,paul,i'm just full of surprises.

298
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,840
555-0190,that is the numbe

299
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,600
you are on cosgrove in theorning.Go ahead,caller.

300
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,880
Hey,pat,my name is sergeant greg parker.

301
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,730
I'm with the police strategic response unit.How are u?

302
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,320
Well,as you know,greg parker,

303
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,940
i have always been an avid fan of law enforcement,but really,you know,

304
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,990
i am just a simple man of the people and l i am trying to do here,

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,380
greg parker,is just deteine the truth.

306
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,290
Okay,i tnk i know what kind of man you are.

307
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,090
And i ink i know what this is about.

308
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,610
Oh,reall greg?

309
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,510
I'm inkin' maybe this doesn't have anything to do witan malone.

310
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,530
I think maybe this has to do with you.

311
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,540
Th is not correct.

312
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,200
You see whathis is really about,greg,

313
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:49,930
this is about the second of june,1999.

314
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,100
On it.

315
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,070
What about that night?

316
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,180
Well,uh...I'm gonna let mr.Malone pick it up from here.

317
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,610
Because,uh.You know all about that night,don't you,councilman?

318
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,010
June the second,1999.

319
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,940
Andhen we return,

320
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,410
we will continueur stimulating conversation here with councilman ryan malone,

321
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,720
who we will fi out,on top of everything else,is...

322
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,050
A murderer.

323
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,010
This,greg,is about a very special te.

324
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,190
This is about...

325
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,440
The second of june,1999.

326
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,650
Sarge,malone was in a major car wreck on that date.

327
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,860
Somebody died.

328
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,550
All right,regional police disvered the car just after 4:00 am.

329
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,600
Tolled.A rollover.

330
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,090
It says that aarmer noticed the smoke from the blaze.

331
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,370
Ry malone was driving?

332
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,850
No,he was the passeng.

333
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,320
Cody ackman was the driver,he was pronounced dead at the scene.

334
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,100
So,in this police report,

335
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,290
malone and ackerman were at a pi gamma frat rty that night

336
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,770
and ackerman was seen drinking before.

337
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,680
Jules.

338
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,350
Go,am.

339
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,370
We found a file relating to ryan malone.

340
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,610
You wanna send it in wi the squad car?

341
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,690
Absolutely.

342
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,430
I get it.

343
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,290
I mean,as hard as it is to imagine,i was young once,ryan,

344
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,600

346
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Councilman,you were wasted.

347
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,330
You had no business getting behind te wheel of that vehicle.

348
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,370
You're right.

349
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,710
S why i wasn't driving that night,pat,it s cody.

350
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,640
He was always looking out for me.

351
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,510
I remember that night perfectly.He,um...

352
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,060
Took the keys from me as we were leaving the fraternity party.

353
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,300
We were driving along this country road,and he was playing with these cassettes...

354
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,710
***

355
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,690
When i came to,i looked over at cody.And he was dead,pat.

356
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,390
Ryan,that's a very ving story,but,you know,it's also a damn lie.

357
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
No it isn't,pat.

358
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,480
You were the one that was driving he car,councilman.

359
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,130
It was you thakilled cody ackerman.

360
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,150
No,i dn't!

361
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,750
Son,unless you tell me the truth about that night,in,like,t next 22 minutes,

362
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,040
i am going to be putng a freaking bullet into your brn.

363
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,580
Do you understand me?

364
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,200
You're insane.

365
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,860
This is about cody ackerman.

366
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,230
Yeah,but what's his connection to corove?

367
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,020
Sgeant,malone's assistant's here.

368
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,220
Thanks,inspector.

369
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,040
Jules,you take it.

370
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,690
I'm goa lk to cosgrove's producer.

371
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,170
Have you been listening to the broadcast?

372
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,210
Are you gonna find him?

373
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,830
Yeah,we'rdoing everything we can.

374
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,320
Listen,do mr.Malone and mr.Cosove have any personal history?

375
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,140
No.

376
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,570
Do you know why he's doing this?

377
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,410
Because he's a hack with a hate- For politicians?

378
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,200
What about the car accident he's talking about?

379
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,300
Mr. Male was in a car crash when hwas in college.

380
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,670
His best friend was killed.

381
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,590
And cosgrove is saying that your boss was drivin.

382
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,040
absolutely not.There was a full investigati.

383
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,790
Absolutely not possible.

384
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,440
Have a look at mr.Malone's platform.

385
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,780
Zero tolerance on drunk drivers.This is an issue very close to his het.

386
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,160
Ght,thank you,nicole.

387
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,110
If we need anything else,we're gonna call u.

388
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,220
ody ackerman?No,pat ver mentioned him before.

389
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,170
Ms.Wallace,you've been his producer for over 10 years.

390
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,050
Is there anything else you can te us about him?

391
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,380
i know pat as well as anybody at the station,but i don't really know him,you kn.

392
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,600
Off the air,hs a private kinda guy.

393
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,600
Never married,no kids.He's got a brother.

394
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,970
Lives intown somewhere.

395
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,820
Spike?

396
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,070
Brotr.On it.

397
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,690
What about the drinking?

398
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,970
That stard a few weeks ago.

399
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,150
A friend of his fromcollege came by,janet something.

400
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,930
Do you know what thetalked about?

401
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,540
No,but,itidn't seem like a happy reunion.

402
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,830
I could hear 'em arguing all the way dow the hall.

403
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,520
He disappeared that afternoon.

404
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,330
Came back the ne day,drunk,went on the air,started trashing malone.

405
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,710
And he ner talked about malone before that?

406
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,620
- Not really.
- What upset him?

407
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,040
No.

408
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,430
I'm gonna need tosee the visitor sign-In log.

409
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,070
Sure.

410
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,490

Ackerman?

415
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,700
So?

416
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,440
Janet ackerman is cody's mother.

417
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,180
And it turns out she and cosgrove have known each other fomore then 30 years.

418
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,000
So janet's son gets killed,and she wants pat to get justice?

419
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,950
I don't know cody was killed more than 1 years ago.Why now?

420
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,000
Hey,winnie,let's send some uni's over and pick up a janet ackerman.

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,530
I thought it was becae you're a geek.

429
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,770
He's not a geek,kay?

430
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,660
He's a geek with combat skills.

431
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,320
That's why the ladies love him.

432
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,890
Eddie,what's your eta.

433
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,170
10 minutes away.

434
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,380
More like five.

435
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,270
Haveyou been a politician for so long that you've forgotten how to tellhe truth?

436
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,510
I'm not gonna lie just to tell you what you wanna hear.

437
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,920
Are you ready to die ryan?

438
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,990
That's justhe booze talking,pat,

439
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,770
i don't think you have it in you to ll that trigger.

440
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,550
Well,i suose we'll all find out the answero that question in,like,uh...

441
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,400
17 minutes.

442
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Pat and i were in a lot of classes together in college.We were good friends.

443
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,810
And y've kept in touch over the years?

444
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,330
Yes,but what he's doing today,this isn him.

445
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,290
How well did pat know cody?

446
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,290
Well,pat was living on the west coast while cody was growing up.

447
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,820
They only met a few times over the years,but i hink that pat was fond of him.

448
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,200
Fond enough to want to seek retribution for his death?

449
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,680
Pat's been drinking again.

450
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,280
I mean,it can make people do things they wouldn't normally do.

451
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,610
M.Ackerman,pat started drinkinagain when he saw u a few weeks ago;

452
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,850
when you had that argument.

453
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,140
Now,did that have anything to do with thaccident?

454
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,470
Look,i've been livingith this night for 10 years.

455
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,520
My son was vilified,sergeant parker.

456
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,320
And you dot think cody was driving?

457
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,360
In't know what to believe.

458
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,930
But there was barely an investation.No inquest.

459
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,640
By the time i got out to the accint that night,

460
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,660
ryan's father was already glad-Handingith the police.

461
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,280
The next thing i know,they pinned it all on  son.

462
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,160
'Kay,it sounds like y have a lot of reasons thate ryan malone.

463
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,020
But you're not thene holding theun to his head.

464
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,220
Is he doing ts for you?

465
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,490
Are you putting him up to this?

466
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,460
Of course not.I never wanted him to hurt ryan.

467
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,410
Then why is he doing this?

468
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,640
Wh having met cody a few times,

469
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,500
why is he willing o kill a man who he thinks is responsible for his death?

470
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,890
Why is he doing that?

471
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,620
Because c was his son ?

472
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,450
That's what you told him a few weeks ago,

473
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,750
that he was cody's father?

474
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,070
Pat and i were together when we were young.

475
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,760
It was stormy.I-I loved him,but i knew that hwasn't the right guy to marry.

476
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,180
I married gary.

477
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,230
And cody?

478
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,020
It waone time.

479
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,240
He came in from out of town and i got pregnant.

480
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,730
Gary would've been devastated if he'd found out thatody wasn't his own.

481
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,860
But pat was wild and self-Absorbed and...

482
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,590
Why,after all these years,why,after cody's death,why tell him now?

483
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,890
'Cause gary's ge.

484
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,700
And i couldn't live with it anymore.

485
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,030
And i thout pat deserved to know abouthis.

486
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,960
But i di't know he was gonna do someing like this!

487
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,120

And when i talked to her earlier today about the accident,

520
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,870
nicole said: "mr.Malone w in a car crash when he was in university.

521
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,180
His best friend was killed.

522
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,850
And no mention that they knew each other at all back then?

523
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,210
And she was definity protecting him today.

524
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,420
He's more than just an assistant.

525
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,100
Yeah,she's hiding something.

526
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,470

533
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,150
How about we continue this conversation in private,pat?

534
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,050

535
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,680
I owe it to my listers to let them know that the same man

who is intenon running the highest office in this city,

537
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,610
is the same man who killed cody ackerman.

538
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,200
Okay,well,if that's the case,then let us look into it.You've done your job here.

539
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,410
W reopen the investigation,you have my promise.

540
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,960
i don't need an investigtion!

541
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,050
P,are you doing this for janet?

542
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,380
Oh,she's got nothing to do with this.

543
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Oh,wait a minute.You know...

544
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,380
No,listen.This was all...This was my decision.

545
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,710
Okay?Janet had nothin to do with any of this.

546
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,690
Okay,but i know that cody was your son.

547
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,840
And what,net told you that?

548
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,750
Yes.

549
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,850
He was what?

550
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,630
And she'sorried about you,pat.

551
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,600
She never expected that you'd do anything ike this.

552
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,230
She wants you to stop.

553
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,180
Don't you worry about hing,greg parker,because i wil be stopping soon enough.

554
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,700
All right,apartment 612.

555
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,290
Thereare windows on the west and south side.

556
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,290
Sam,grab a sniper perch.Get us eyein.

557
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,200
You ready?

558
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,950
It was a warm june evening when ryan malone

559
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,850
and cody ackerman were attending a fraterny party,

560
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,220
whiey left at approximately 2:00 am.

561
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,930
And although he should not have,

562
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,830
ryan malone got behind the wheel of h vehicle.

563
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,330
I've told you...

564
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,530
It's myurn.

565
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,310
And like many a drunk driver before him,

566
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,820
ryan felt that he was in control of this situation.

567
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,790
Which,of course,he was not.

568
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,930
You see,folks,there was...

569
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,450
Tre was no reason for this to happen.

570
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:48,930
No reason whatsoever,except for just plain bad judgement.

571
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,230
I sympathize.

572
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,910
Because i can't imagine what that must've been like or you,that moment.

573
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,950
You know,one bad decision and suddenly everything...

574
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,350
Evething that your family had planned for you,

575
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:12,520
everything that your father had wanted you to be...

576
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,080
It was all gone.

577
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,360
Your best friend was dead.

578
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,300
But...

579
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,280
He was also the way out of this.

580
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,410
And that must've bee very,very difficult,but,hey,

581
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:38,950
why destroy two lives,especially if one of them was your own?

582
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,420
You drove the car,

583
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,050
and you killed my son

584
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,690
and then you blamed him for his own death?

585
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,440
That's not what happened!

586
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,230
I should have stopped cody from getting behind the wheel.

587
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,700
If you want me to apolize for that,then i do,pat,i swear to god i apologize!

588
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,700
God,do you think i haven't lived with this?

589
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,150
I have.I've lived with this...

590
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,720
Mistake...

591
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,510
At night,every single day of my life,

592
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,250
and i've been trying to atone.

593
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,120
Is everybody listening to the same broadcast that i'm listening to?

594
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,700
Because th become a full-On festival of self-Pity here.

595
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,840
Oh my god,the man who would be mayor has the gall to look at me and say,

596
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,510
oh no,mr.Cosgrove,i was the viim of this tragedy.

597
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,920
I was not its author.

598
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,550
So,i have one question for you,listeners,and that is:

599
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,680
are we gonna let him get away with that?

600
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,820
555-0190,that is the number.Theloves are off!

601
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,510
Let's talk.Are we gonna let ryan malone get away with this?

602
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,760
All right,caller,you're on the air.

603
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,870
i'm with ya.

604
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,770
The politicians are all lying sm.

605
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,000

606
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,150
Ooh,easy,jeremy.

607
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,870
Six minutes left on the clock,let's not get ahead of ourselves.

608
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,770
555-0190,that is the number.

609
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,430
Sam,you got a visual?

610
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,470
I can't get an angle on the west side,and the south side is blocked.

611
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,760
Maybe you can ask him to open his curtains a little bit for me,boss.

612
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,600
You really wanna help your boss?

613
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,110
Are you listening to this?You've gotta do something!

614
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,170
I need you to stop wasting my time.

615
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,530
You,cody and ryan all wento school together.

616
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,680
Okay,So?

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
I need the whole story.

618
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,540
You know who was driving in the carthat night.

619
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,940
No,i don't.Ryan said that...

620
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,840
I think that u do.

621
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,600
An eyewitness said that you left the party with ryan and cody.

622
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,370
Yeah,some drunk frat boy whoept changing his story.

623
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,110
Nile,was his account dismissed because it was buried by your boss's dad?

624
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,570
No,because he was drunk!

625
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,310
How could he remember what really happened that night?

626
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,180
So were you and your friends; i could askou the same thing.

627
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,560
There was a full investigation.

628
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,560
Osgrove is going to kill him in five minutes

629
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,440

00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,510
But mr.Malonwasn't driving either.

685
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,820
Wwere all at that party...

686
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,090
I-I honestly thought that i was okay,

687
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,590
we were only going a few miles.

688
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,910
It was late.

689
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,890
There was nobody on the road.

690
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,230
Cody was  the front seat...

691
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,300
He didn't have his belt on.

692
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,130
He was turned around talking to ryan in the back.

693
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,000
I missed a curve...

694
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,470
I was going too fast.

695
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,020
Cody was dead.

696
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,750
He was my boyfriend,and i loved him,and i killed him.

697
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,510
God,we were so scared,mr.Cosgrove.

698
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,100
Rn said,"put him behind the wheel.

699
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,000
I said,"no.

700
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,390
But he said cody would've wanted it that way.

701
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,720
He would've wanted to protect me.

702
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,620
He wouldn't have wanted me to wreck my life.

703
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,020
Ryan td me he'd take care of it; that i shouldn't be involved.

704
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,920
All ryan ever wanted to do was protect me.

705
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,590
I'm so sorry.

706
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,760
You didn't drive he car?

707
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,540
My son didn't drive the car?

708
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
No he didt,sir.

709
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,870
But you let him take the blame for that?

710
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,350
He loved nicole.

711
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,710
I know that he wouldn't have wanted her to pay for this.

712
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,120
He was that kinda gu your son.

713
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,710
Well,i'm sorry.

714
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,550
I wish,uh...

715
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,160
I wish i woulda known my boy.

716
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,510
Or maybe it's better that he idn't know me.

717
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,080
What are you doing,pat?

718
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,990

719
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,670

725
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,920

Oh no,wait,plse,i have to see him.

730
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,580
They'll let me through.Please!

731
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,460
I'm sorry.

732
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,270
It's not your fault who i am.

733
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,800
Your son would not have had a problem with who you are.

734
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,190
Mr. Malone?

735
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,070
So you've been protecting nicole for 10 years?

736
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,150
We were all fries.

737
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,330
I st cody,i didn't wanna lose her too.

738
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,340
Sad way for cosgrove to end his career.

739
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,820
Well,wasn't exactly a great day for malone either.

740
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,070
You know,now that he's going to jail,

741
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,230
you're gonna have to find yourself a new candidate.

742
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,860
I still think he would've been a great mayor,i do.

743
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,220
Well,maybe you should think about running for office some day.

744
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,310
What,and give up all this?

745
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,080
Paradise!

746
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,460
Who's paradise?

747
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,700
They arrest malone's assistant?

748
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,880
Yeah,they're processing her right now.

749
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,380
Can you believe malone kept her secret?

750
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,990
Why not?

751
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,500
He had a n to his head; he could've been killed.

752
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,140
He was protecting his friend.

753
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,250
I'd do the same.
