parker: if this is about your business,what you do here,i don't know anything about it.

96
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,300
it's about the money,genius.

97
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,110
money?

98
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,310

99
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,840

100
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,340

101
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,440
wordy,grab those two,see if they saw anything.

103
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,540
spike: no blood,no sign of a struggle.

104
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,710
doesn't mean there wasn't one.

105
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,530
car's unlocked.

106
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,230

107
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,880

108
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,230
wordy: excuse me...

109
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,510
- jules: you got the master? - ed: i got it.

110
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,930
gun's still in there.

111
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,140
he wasn't expecting trouble.

112
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,110
anybody seen his cell?

113
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,630
spike and jules: no.

114
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,710
can we locate it?

115
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,580
can if it's on.

116
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,820
let's do it.

117
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,340
i gotta go make a call.

118
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,290
if he tries anything,you know what to do.

119
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,110
kevin: no mistakes,tyler.

120
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,040
tyler: don't worry about me.

121
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,190
i got it all together.

122
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,100
parker: first time with a gun,son?

123
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,080
a lot easier to hold steady with two hands.

124
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,590
i've shot plenty of guns.

125
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,390
okay.but do you mind just pointing it off a little to left?

126
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,200
sure.

127
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,540
you think i'm stupid?

128
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,560
no.

129
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,350
sir,i think you're smart.

130
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,550
you know how easy it is for a gun to go off by mistake.

131
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,220
your finger twitches and the gun goes off.

132
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,040
what would your buddy do if you made a mistake like that?

133
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,940
thank you,son.

134
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,010
spike: here,just to the right.

135
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,490
moving slowly,probably on foot.

136
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,120
you've gotta be kiddin' me.

137
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,640

138
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,710

glynnis: not mine.

145
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,220

146
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,020
spike: did you pick it up on the street?

147
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,530
did you see who dropped it?

148
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,280
he doesn't need it anymore.

149
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,970
why's that?

150
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,730
'cause he's dead.

151
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,190
someone hit him.

152
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,730
ed: did you see who hit him?

153
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,020

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,130

264

272

273
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,870
we got a news article,ten years ago.

274
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,150

275
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,210

277
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,440
ranking officer on the scene,detective greg parker.

278
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,680
detecti?

279
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,570
yeah,back when he was in homicide.

280
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,290
the time fits.

281
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,580
what the hell are you doing dowthere?

282
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,600
just getting the lab ready.

283
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,340
i told you to watch him.

284
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,930
yeah,and then you called her!

285
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,920

288
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,560

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,600
why?

291
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,940
i don't know,it's sealed.

292
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,470
if it's sealed,we need a court order.

293
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,410
it could take days.

294
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,990
we don't have days!

295
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,390
jules: ed,we all kw that.

296
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,470
okay.

297
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,870
all right,see if you can get one of the lawyers to unseal it,for now.

298
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,120
copy.

299
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,900
it's like a fortress.

300
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,730
here.

301
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,660
parker: haley,stop!

302
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,570
stop!stop.

303
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,290
a place like this,lots of surprises.

304
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,190
what do you mean,a place like this?

305
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,290
you don't know?

306
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,620
i've never been here.

307
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,280
i haven't seen kevin in months.

308
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,590
it's a meth lab,haley.

309
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,310
see the propane tanks when you came in?

310
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,580
all the brass rned blue.

311
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,990
smel that?

312
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,280
haley: i thought it was cats.

313
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,100
kevin: doors are all closed,maybe down here.

314
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,630
come on,up on the roof.

315
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,830
there's gotta be a door there.

316
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,710
go up.go,go,go,go.

317
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,580
spike: i've got a last known on hay.

318
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,510
it's group home in riverdale.

319
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,650
and i've got the social worker on line two.

320
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,900
okay,good.i'll talk to her.

321
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,770
and spike,get me those emails.

322
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,090
copy.

323
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,000
ed: so you're saying you knew about the two of them?

324
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,740
the emails?

325
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,130
wendy: the emails,the visits,the phone calls.

326
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,170
haley practically worshipped him.

327
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,610
i guess it's not surprising,considering what he did for her.

328
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,840
and what do you know about that?

329
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,300
wendy: just what haley told me.

330
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,630
she was eight.

331
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,180
her mother was an addict,they lived in a flophouse.

332
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,950
the cops came by with a warnt for her boyfriend one night,

333
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,440
and i guess he didn't feel like co-operating.

334
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,960
all haley said she could remember was the sounds...

335
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,720
do it!

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,810
baby,get under the bed!

337
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,730
getnder the bed!

338
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,830
oh god,they're coming.

339
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,000
get it!baby?

340
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,590
get the gun!

341
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,340
she was eight.

342
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,880
i can't imagine.

343
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,560
parker: it's okay.

344
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,110
i got you.

345
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,730
wendy: he covered her up,wouldn't let her out of his sight 'til children's aid showed up.

346
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,410
a lot of cops wouldn't have done that,but he did.

347
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,700
yeah,that sounds like greg.

348
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,810
wendy: later,haley had some drug problems of her own.

349
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,410
but greg would come by,just talk to her.

350
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,880
once she broke up with kevin,she got back on track.

351
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,590
kevin who?

352
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,080
wendy: persheski.

353
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,290
long line of meth heads.

354
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:29,240
she met him in the program,and he was no fan of greg's.

355
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,140
ed: thanks for your help.

356
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,270
parker: what are you doing here,haley?

357
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,760
i thought you were done with kevin.

358
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,810
we talked about that.

359
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,960
i was.i am.

360
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,330
but he called,he said he needed help.

361

00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,850
oh,the cops?the cops?

431
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,050
if you ever try to look at this case,it's sealed.

432
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,890
the cops are trying to cover their ownss.

433
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,420
i mean,who are you gonna blame for shooting the mother of a little girl?

434
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,820
the cops or some junkie?

435
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,250
who do you believe?

436
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,400

437
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,140

joe: do what you want to me,i got nothin' to say.

440
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,160

i'm just gonna put you in a squad car,drive you around for a little while,

443
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:55,130
while all your buddies here get busted for possession,resisting,that kind of thing.

444
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,180
then you can explain to them why they all have court dates

445
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,600
and you're running around scot-free.

446
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,480
i'm sure they're gonna undstand.

447
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,220

448
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,480

449
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,350

463
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,930
cent looking boy,joe: uh,my side of the family.

464
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,530
why didn't you just tell me?

465
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,690
kevin: because it's the truth.

466
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,730
theruth is,he never cared about you.

467
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,930
no,greg did care.

468
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,540
he saved me.

469
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,060
he kt me together.

470
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,640
you know the answer to that.

471
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,930
i didn't keep you together,you kept me together.

472
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,730
what the hell is that supposed to mean?

473
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,450
parker: it means that you,me and haley,we're not so different,okay?

474
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:04,270
i know what it's like to wanna hide,i know what it's like to make yourself feel numb.

475
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,750
on the night that i found haley underhat bed,i was a mess.

476
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,960
i mean,the stuff you see everyday as a cop,on the job,

477
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,700
makes you wanna make some bad choices and mine was the bottle.

478
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,350
that night,after everything...

479
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:28,450
i hit the bottle harder than i ever had before and when i woke up...

480
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,700
my family was gone.

481
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,460
my wife was gone; she took my son.

482
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,120
he was six-years-old,i haven't sn him since.

483
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,580
so?

484
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,580
is that her fault?

485
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
is that what you're saying?

486
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,270
no.

487
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,030
no,that's my fault.

488
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,880
that's my fault.

489
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,330
so,i took a leave from the job,holed up at home,

490
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:54,740
case of vodka and a promise: either i finish these bottles or they finish me.

491
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,760
and then i g this letter...

492
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:04,790
out of nowhere,in kid's handwriting.

493
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,980
"hi,detective parker,it's me,haley.

494
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,940
and i wanted to say thank you for helping me.

495
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:22,590
" and she s scared,but she was gonna be brave.

496
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
an eight-year-old girl.

497
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,270
took me three days to sober up and then that's when i wrote you back.

498
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,410
everything i ever did for you,you did for me,okay?

499
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,580
and what happened after that night,what you've become,

500
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,150
what i've seen you turn into,haley,that's...

501
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,340
that's what matters.

502
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,580
so,all this time was just because of what you did to my mom that nht?

503
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,760
parker: no,haley.

504
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,470
big gate at the front,don't know how you're getting through.

505
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,050
sam: hat shouldn't be a problem.

00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,690

507
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,900
joe: turn coming up.

508
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,940
spi: we're looking at a highly volile environment.

509
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,400
air could have anything in it from acetone ored phosphorous,isopropyl alcohol.

510
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,540
everything's flammable and unstable,guys.

511
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,290
jules: guns,rams,c.s.gas,ey can all give off a spark.

512
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,430
go for lane.

513
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,410
man: got your message,ed.

514
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,460
jim keach,what the hell's going on with greg?

515
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,140
ed: hey,jim,we got a situation here.

516
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,180
we don't have a lot of time.

517
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,600
listen,you remember about 10 years ago,you and greg were partners in homicide?

518
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,450
you had a case,a woman named brynne got shot?do you remember that?

519
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,590
yeah,what about it?

520
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,940
well,the little girl in that case,we think she's involved here today.

521
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,810
we need to know what happened that night.

522
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,770
case file is sealed on that one,ed.

523
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,700
ed: i know that,jim.

524
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,370
so,you're the only one who can tell me the whole story.

525
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,530
i don't think greg's gonna mind,considering what's going on here.

526
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,940
yeah,i don't know about that one,ed,

527
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,020
but seeing as how greg was the one who sealed it in the first place...

528
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,890
he did?

529
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,150
keach: yeah.

530
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,790
well,can you tell me why?

531
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,990
he had his reasons.

532
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,600
the main thing i remember is...

533
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,320
the poster in that girl's room.

534
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,390
we'd been after teller three months.

535
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,370
warrant came through that night...

536
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,120
haley.

537
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,650
haley,listen to me.listen to me.

538
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,100
kevin: i think she's heard enough from you,greg.

539
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,210
right,hale?

540
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,150
maybe i blew it between us,but maybe now i can make something right.

541
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,960
'cause now,we take care of this,maybe you can have some peace.

542
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,670
put those nightmares behind you finally.

543
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,180
haley,get outta here.

544
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,060
get outta here.

545
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,070
kevin: think i'm gonna hurt her,greg?

546
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,360
i'm doing this for her.

547
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,160
parker: for her?

548
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,640
what's it gonna be like for killing a police officer?

549
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,820
kev: no,what's gonna happen is,is that we're gonna be gone,

550
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,680
this place is gonna blow and all they're gonna find is some cop

551
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,120
who shouldn't have been snooping around a volatile meth lab.

552
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,040
parker: haley,you can't be a part of this,you have to go to the police.

553
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,050
you can't take a life.

554
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,460
once you ta a life,it ruins your own.it can't be undone.

555
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,240
just go,haley.just go!

556
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,360

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,300

566
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,770
haley: kevin,please don't do this.

567
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,260
parker: haley!

568
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,020
haley: kevin!

569
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,210
okay.

570
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,510
it's already done,okay?

571
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,730
we gotta get away from here.

572
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,210
- kevin: take her.
- tyler: move!

573
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,820
spike,check that van.

574
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,380
clear

575
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,340
i want everything n-conductive.

576
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,290
rubberized climbers,gorilla bars,everything.

577
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,790
spike,floor plans?

578
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,750
nothing i could find.

579
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,560
ed: all right,we're gonna eyeball this one.

580
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,360
let's fan out.

581
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,980
low profile.

582
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,310
and talk to me.

583
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,580
haley: no,please,you can't do this.

584
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,630
kevin: this is for you.

585
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,150
- haley: please,you can't do this.
- tyler: i swear to god,if you don't shut up...

586
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,280
no!

587
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,010
every window on green wall is secure.

588
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,620
bars and grates.

589
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,600
jules: same on red.

590
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,720
we're on black wall now.

591
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,680
ed: same on white.

592
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,660
the only way we're getting in there is with a cutting torch.

593
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,430
no flames,too risky.

594
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,230
anybody else have an entrance?

595
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,280
and check for explosives.

596
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,770
possible entry on black wall.

597
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,280
heavily fortified though,we're testing now.

598
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,970
hal: let me go.

599
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,430
tyler: you wish!

600
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
kevin: don't you touch her!

601
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,000
this is your problem,man.

602
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,900
haley: we have to go back.

603
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,800
no,haley,just...just trust me,okay?

604
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,310
trust me.

605
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,670
spike: guys,heavy nitrate residue on this door,it's too risky.

606
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,580
we need an entrance,people.

607
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,510
wordy,leah,can you make it happen?

608
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,370
not without making a lot of noise.

609
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,110
come on,people,we gotta get in here.

610
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,030

611
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,380
all right.

612
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,520
ed: how many inside?

613
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,170
tyler: it's not my fault,i didn't wanna do it.

614
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,140
how many?!

615
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,910

635
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,340

636
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,620

we need to know where greg is,kevin.

640

642
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,150

00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,470
he didn't tell you?

680
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,360
okay,kevin,you want the truth?

681
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,540
here it is.

682
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,550

dq sweet deals ed: now i know.

684
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,050
i know you don't want to believe that.

685
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,170
i did not shoot my mother.

686
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,650
greg didn't tell you haley because you were a kid.

687
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,430
you didn't mean to shoot anybody,all right?

688
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,850
he knew what that would do to you,that's all

689
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,500
the poster in your room.

690
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,890
remember the poster

691
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,110
brynne: get out of here!

692
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,950

695
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,710
brynne: oh,they're coming.

696
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,290
brynne: get it.

697
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,250
baby,get the gun.

698
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:43,490
ed: that's how the cops found out; there was blood on the poster.

699
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,920
that the shot could only have come from inside the room,from the floor.

700
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,870
now that gun had a hair igger on it,haley.

701
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,120
it had a hair trigger,coulda happened to anybody.

702
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,070
anybody.

703
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:03,240
now,i know greg like you do and he must have had a pretty good reason not to tell y this today.

704
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,120
i got you now

705
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:13,360
i want my friend to live,and i'm betting you do,too.

706
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,890
i had the gun.

707
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,680
it was in my hand.

708
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,010
it was my fault.

709
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,430
