1
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:04,485
Come on... Where
are you, Rebecca?

2
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:10,058
Rebecca...

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,058
Rebecca!

4
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:13,159
Oh my God!
Are you okay?

5
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:14,695
Stuart...

6
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:16,229
Spike, can you get it
so we see what he's seeing?

7
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:18,799
Rebecca... Moments away, boss.

8
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:21,501
<i>You thought you'd be my hero?
You thought you'd just rescue me?</i>

9
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:24,004
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

10
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:25,238
This isn't some game,
Stuart.

11
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:27,873
These are dangerous men, <i>they
have Eric out there right now</i>

12
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:29,374
looking for the leak.

13
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:30,977
Do you understand?
They're looking for you!

14
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:32,377
Okay. Okay. I'm-I'm
gonna tell the cops

15
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:33,613
where you are right now.

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,949
Just don't, please...
If you call the cops, I'm dead!

17
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,384
Do you understand?
I'm dead!

18
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:47,358
Okay, I got one for you.
Hypothetically speaking...

19
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:50,228
and I'm just speaking
hypothetically here...

20
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:54,666
if someone you know
is about to do something bad,

21
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,501
is it your responsibility
to stop them?

22
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:57,802
<i>How bad?</i>

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,903
<i>You want a ten-point scale?</i>

24
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,338
- Yes.
<i>- Okay.</i>

25
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:04,842
<i>Um, if one is not picking up</i>
<i>after your dog,</i>

26
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:08,212
and ten is... Murdering
Santa Claus...

27
00:01:09,648 --> 00:01:11,682
Right in front of the elves -
santacide.

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,951
I'm glad that we're
getting so scientific about this.

29
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:14,952
Of course.

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,054
Anyways,
on that scale,

31
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:19,489
well, this is about a seven.

32
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:22,125
<i>Seven... that sounds criminal.</i>

33
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:23,160
<i>It is.</i>

34
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:24,427
Okay. Why didn't you say?

35
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:27,330
Yeah, if someone's about to commit
a seven, then you call the cops.

36
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:28,931
That's what I thought.

37
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,367
What are you doing?

38
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:31,967
Are you having
an Internet fight?

39
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:34,603
No. I'm just
making conversation.

40
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:35,971
Okay, well I gotta go.

41
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,207
But Stuart,
I just wanted to let you know

42
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:41,177
that I got an "a"
on my final.

43
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:44,146
Are you kidding me? That's...
Rebecca, that's great.

44
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:45,347
So thanks for that.

45
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:46,982
<i>No, that is all you.</i>

46
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,849
<i>No, it isn't.
You helped me a ton.</i>

47
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,218
So I just...

48
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,153
I wanted to let you know
how grateful I am.

49
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,154
It's no problem.

50
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:54,522
You're a great friend.

51
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:57,392
Likewise.

52
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,928
Ugh! Okay. Blah!
Mushy mush.

53
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,863
I gotta go.
Bye.

54
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:08,335
Likewise?

55
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:10,370
Good job, Stuart.

56
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,626
<i>No, it was a disaster.
It's not spicy enough.</i>

57
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,194
<i>See, that's why you never
cook without an assistant.</i>

58
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:35,595
<i>- You offering?</i>
<i>- No, you can't fool me.</i>

59
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:38,598
Oh, you...

60
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:43,168
Okay.

61
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,606
What?

62
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:48,608
You ever gonna tell her? Who?

63
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,710
Why are you communicating
in looks?

64
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:53,911
Spike, you're incapable
of walking past Winnie's desk

65
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,880
without trying
to make her laugh.

66
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:59,351
Oh, wow, Leah,
that's so far off.

67
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:00,818
You should tell her
how you feel.

68
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,054
It's sort of embarrassing
how far off that is.

69
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:05,323
Point is, Spike, there's no
upside in keeping it secret.

70
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:06,457
Well, I'm not keeping
anything secret.

71
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:08,459
You're right about that.

72
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:10,661
<i>Hey, Spike, can you
come take a look at this?</i>

73
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,363
Excuse me, Leah,
I've got work to do.

74
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,364
Mm-hm.

75
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:14,431
Yeah.

76
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:17,801
- What's up?
- I don't know,

77
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:20,771
this just popped up
on my screen.

78
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:22,639
<i>Well, did you
open an email or a link?</i>

79
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,974
No, no. I didn't do anything.
It just came out of nowhere.

80
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,243
According to that timestamp,
the image is live.

81
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,745
A prank?
Doubt it.

82
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,580
You gotta penetrate through
some pretty thick security

83
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:31,781
to get to
our internal network.

84
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:34,150
<i>An attack?</i>

85
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:35,385
<i>We better get boss.</i>

86
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:37,353
See if anybody else is getting this.
Okay.

87
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:42,457
<i>Man, check this out.</i>

88
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,659
What do you got, Spike?

89
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:45,126
A roadside cafe.

90
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:46,361
<i>It's a rogue signal.</i>

91
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:58,939
<i>Whoever's feeding us</i>
<i>is following this guy around</i>

92
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,575
<i>like a live TV director.</i>

93
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:06,980
<i>Where is that?</i>

94
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:08,482
Those power lines.
- That's Highway 7.

95
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,650
Halton Truck Stop.

96
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:11,751
<i>Just talked to IT.</i>
Nobody else is reporting the signal.

97
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,819
So this is for us?

98
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,188
<i>Guys, right there.</i>

99
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,228
We got a hot call,
Halton Truck Stop.

100
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,863
Let's move!

101
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,399
Winnie, a chopper
up, APB on both vehicles,

102
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,934
and see if cruisers
are in the area.

103
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,935
You got it.

104
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,206
<i>Boss, video gives us
a partial plate on the car</i>

105
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,606
but nothing to ID the rig.

106
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,774
<i>Copy, Spike.</i>

107
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,176
Share what you got
with the unis.

108
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,178
<i>Winnie, get me someone</i>
<i>from auto theft.</i>

109
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,214
<i>You got it.</i>

110
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,249
Just talked to the security company
at the truck stop. Nobody saw a thing.

111
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,616
<i>Now how is that, Jules?</i>

112
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,184
Weren't we watching
through their cameras?

113
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,687
Well, it seems so, but they record
on a loop. <i>Nobody was monitoring.</i>

114
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,556
Someone was.

115
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,190
<i>Well, our tipster must've
hacked into the system,</i>

116
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,826
<i>tapped into the signal</i>
<i>and routed it to us.</i>

117
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,061
<i>That's great; Hacked their
system, hacked our system...</i>

118
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,596
This guy doesn't have
a phone?

119
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,164
Maybe it's a rival gang.
They wanna remain anonymous.

120
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:02,333
Boss, I've got Detective Wendy
Travis from the Auto Theft Squad.

121
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:04,201
<i>Put her through.</i>

122
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,503
<i>Sergeant,
thanks for contacting me.</i>

123
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,204
I understand you have
a semi-truck theft?

124
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,939
Yeah, that's right.
Halton Truck Stop.

125
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,475
Let me
guess, driver abducted?

126
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,542
<i>Sounds like
you know this crew.</i>

127
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,877
Well, I know their work.

128
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,245
My unit's been tracking them
for months.

129
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:15,812
Okay,
please talk to us.

130
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,383
<i>They're a slick operation</i>
high-value targets only, late-model rigs,

131
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,884
expensive cargo.

132
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:22,719
Well, if it's about property,
why the abduction?

133
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,421
Well, they're buying time.

134
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:27,190
They grab the driver,
strip out the rig's GPS,

135
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:29,158
throw both in the back
of a support vehicle

136
00:05:29,226 --> 00:05:30,727
<i>and then continue along</i>
<i>the truck's route.</i>

137
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:32,995
So the dispatcher
doesn't suspect a thing.

138
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:34,263
<i>He has no reason to.</i>

139
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,931
<i>Looks like everything's</i>
<i>rolling normal.</i>

140
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,433
<i>The thieves then take</i>
<i>the stolen rig</i>

141
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:38,768
to an unknown location,

142
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:40,803
they unload the cargo
and chop the truck.

143
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:42,037
That's the last
we ever see of it.

144
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:43,406
Then, hours later,

145
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:44,940
the driver shows up
at the side of the road.

146
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:46,241
Harmed?

147
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:47,542
<i>Well, sometimes.</i>

148
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,177
Last driver took a tire iron to the head.
<i>Three days in a coma.</i>

149
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:51,479
Okay, team,

150
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:54,048
these guys are gonna get violent if
we push them, so let's be cautious.

151
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:55,450
<i>Listen, sergeant,</i>

152
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:57,985
<i>this outfit's stolen four million dollars</i>
in trucks and cargo in the last year,

153
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,087
and my unit hasn't even
had a sniff.

154
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:01,989
How did SRU
get on top of this?

155
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,057
Tell you the truth,
Detective,

156
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,159
we're not entirely sure.

157
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:23,743
<i>Suspect vehicle heading
southbound on Highway 427.</i>

158
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,813
Team one, the car's been
spotted heading southbound on the 427.

159
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,581
<i>Two cruisers in pursuit.</i>

160
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:31,351
Okay, tell them we're on our way.
Tell them to hang back.

161
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:33,619
Sam, Jules,
you're with us on the car.

162
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,422
Spike, Leah,
you are on the rig.

163
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:37,222
Copy.

164
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,857
<i>Car just took exit
on the County road 50,</i>

165
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:41,593
and chopper's got a visual
on the semi.

166
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:43,929
Headed westbound
on service road 33,

167
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,530
just crossed Bellmont.

168
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:48,834
Here. Some farmland,
undeveloped forest.

169
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:50,836
Good visibility, no exits.

170
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:52,570
Let's set our net.

171
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:55,306
<i>Team, we've spotted the car.</i>

172
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,141
Go, Eddie.

173
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,818
Can we box him in?

174
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,687
If the whole team was here,
but not with those cruisers.

175
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:10,788
<i>If we shoot the tires,</i>

176
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:12,155
he could ride the rims
for miles.

177
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,691
There's a hostage in there,
we gotta end this.

178
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:14,992
Sam, pit manoeuvre;
Hang back,

179
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,325
I'll take point.
Let's go.

180
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:17,460
Got it.

181
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,930
<i>Bring it back.</i>

182
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,699
<i>A bit more.</i>

183
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:25,001
<i>Bit more.</i>

184
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,569
Good.

185
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:29,539
Officer Scarlatti?
Detective Travis.

186
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,273
We put a hail out
on all the frequencies,

187
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,008
so whoever's driving that truck
isn't listening.

188
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:34,510
Let's hope
he's a visual person.

189
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:35,611
Right.

190
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:41,082
<i>Ed, in position.</i>

191
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,519
All right, hang on.

192
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:51,792
And... showtime!

193
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,136
Out of the vehicle now!
Out of the vehicle now!

194
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:02,570
Down on the ground now!
Do it now!

195
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:04,538
On the ground!

196
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:07,207
Hands behind your back!
Hands behind your back!

197
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:08,842
<i>Do it now!</i>

198
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,544
All right, buddy. You're okay.
Feet first.

199
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:12,612
I got ya. Here, I got ya.

200
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,048
- You're okay.
- Here you go.

201
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:15,749
Where's my rig?

202
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,084
It's all right, sir,
we'll get your truck back.

203
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:20,319
I don't care about the truck! It's the
cargo; It's full of Anhydrous Ammonia.

204
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,256
Pull the roadblock!
Tear it down!

205
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:24,790
- What?
- Now! Now!

206
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,559
Talk to me, Spike.

207
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:29,095
Boss, Anhydrous Ammonia
is a pressurized liquid gas.

208
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:31,531
It's very toxic
and extremely volatile.

209
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:32,731
If that rig gets into a wreck,

210
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,200
it's gonna blow everything
sky-high.

211
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,768
Guys, go!
Come on!

212
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:38,170
Get the cars out!
Go!

213
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,338
Move! Move!
Go! Go! Go!

214
00:08:40,406 --> 00:08:42,274
Come on!

215
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:50,848
Oh, come on.
Come on.

216
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:55,152
What're you doing?

217
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:57,555
Don't lose him.

218
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:03,894
<i>Boss, that truck
was not gonna stop.</i>

219
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,762
Truck's continuing along 33.

220
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,098
<i>We can intercept
at Dixie Road.</i>

221
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:08,431
<i>And then what?</i>

222
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:09,865
We got an awfully determined
subject here.

223
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,302
We can stop it with a fifty cal,
steel core round.

224
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,804
Hit the intake manifold,
engine stops dead.

225
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,807
Ed, that's ten square inches,
traveling 80 Miles an hour,

226
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,041
hidden under a hood.

227
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,176
Boss,
we can't wait this out here.

228
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:21,611
That truck gets into
a populated area,

229
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:23,146
it's gonna go from bad
to worse.

230
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,413
Okay, set it up, Eddie.

231
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,647
Detective Travis,

232
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:26,948
we need to lock down
that highway,

233
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,317
<i>evac the whole area.</i>

234
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,418
I'm on it, sergeant.

235
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,620
Jules, why ammonia?
Bombs?

236
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:35,290
Oklahoma, Oslo, Delhi -
all ammonia-based bombs.

237
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:37,759
<i>But it's also used in</i>
<i>methamphetamine drug-making.</i>

238
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,595
And this crew,
so far they've stolen

239
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,796
electronic equipment,
medical supplies, machinery.

240
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:44,499
Stuff with street value.

241
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:46,900
Yeah, I don't think these guys are
terrorists. I think they're opportunists.

242
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:48,169
Spike, what about our tipster?

243
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:49,637
Well, all I can say
at this point

244
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:51,139
is that he's good,
boss.

245
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,706
<i>To infiltrate</i>
<i>our internal servers,</i>

246
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:55,576
not to mention remotely hijack
our CCTV system,

247
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:57,177
that's big league.

248
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:58,378
Does that mean
our comm is compromised?

249
00:09:58,446 --> 00:09:59,712
<i>I don't know.</i>

250
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,548
I can tell you he's been
in our system for awhile.

251
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:02,949
How do you know that?

252
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:04,417
Well, he had to tunnel
through the firewall,

253
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:06,686
and set up some kind of
encrypted backdoor controls.

254
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,188
It takes time.

255
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:09,489
That goes for the
cameras he hijacked too.

256
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:11,424
He would've had to crack them
in advance.

257
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:14,360
<i>So this guy's been
planning this day for a while.</i>

258
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:16,061
- Hey.
- Hey.

259
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,396
Give me one sec, Recci,

260
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:19,398
I'm right...
In the middle of something.

261
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:20,499
Okay.

262
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,977
We'll cover below.

263
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,546
All right, be careful.

264
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:49,059
<i>Ed, the intake manifold
runs along the top of the block,</i>

265
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,395
<i>about three feet back</i>
<i>from the grill.</i>

266
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:52,529
Okay, Spike,
we got it.

267
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,070
<i>We're in position.</i>

268
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,370
For a clean shot,

269
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:02,971
you'd wanna hit it
three inches off center.

270
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,707
Left or right?

271
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,242
Hard to say without
knowing of the engine's stock.

272
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,843
You're just gonna
have to find it.

273
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,178
But the main thing is,
you aim low,

274
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:10,646
you're into radiator,

275
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:12,081
and that thing can rumble on
for miles.

276
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:13,482
If you miss high,

277
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,184
you could deflect off the hood,
hit the driver...

278
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:16,485
And we got a runaway bomb.

280
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:53,629
Here it comes.

281
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,266
<i>Should I call back?</i>

282
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,067
No. Sorry.
Hang on one sec...

283
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,802
This is almost over.

284
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,381
300 meters...

285
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,449
Contact, left of center.
No effect.

286
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:16,550
Come on, Eddie.

287
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:20,654
Two hundred fifty...
Two hundred.

288
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:23,857
<i>Jules</i>
<i>got it! Target hit.</i>

289
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:29,629
Let's move.

290
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:45,877
Show us your hands!

291
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,479
<i>Hands where we can see them,</i>
<i>right now!</i>

292
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,181
<i>SRU! Get out of the vehicle!</i>

293
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,716
SRU! Get
out of the truck!

294
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:54,253
- On your knees!
- Get down right now!

295
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:03,761
Who is this guy?

296
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:04,829
What is this?
Where is he?

297
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:06,331
Where is who?

298
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,466
<i>One sec, Becca.</i>

299
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:10,701
Rebecca?!

300
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,136
I gotta go, Stu.
I'll call you back.

301
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,372
No. No, no, no.
Becca, hold...

302
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,840
what's going on?

303
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:16,841
Anybody call?
Did anybody come by?

304
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:17,908
No... no.
What's going on?

305
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,944
Come back to me,
Rebecca.

306
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:21,979
Are you sure?

307
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:23,681
No, no, no. No. No!

308
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,349
<i>Okay, look, we
gotta go out for a bit.</i>

309
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,384
Eric, just calm down! Talk to me.
What's the matter?

310
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:28,853
Everything
! Everything's the matter!

311
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,721
<i>No! What's he doing there?</i>

312
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:31,922
Come on.
No, hold on.

313
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,023
What kind of trouble
are you in?

314
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:34,191
Okay. Right now,
let's go.

315
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:35,258
No! Get off!
I'm not going with you.

316
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,029
<i>Wait.</i>

317
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:44,467
<i>- Your ride's here.</i>
<i>- Let's go to the kitchen.</i>

318
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:45,468
<i>Where are we going? No
one's going to the kitchen!</i>

319
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,370
<i>We're going to the warehouse.</i>

320
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:50,206
Think, think.

321
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:51,374
<i>- I'm not talking to you.</i>
<i>- Relax.</i>

322
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:52,741
I'm not ask you,
all right?

323
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,343
I'm telling you!

324
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,843
Relax, okay? I'm going!

325
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:57,045
<i>Don't tell me to relax!</i>

326
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:58,113
Damn it!

327
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,347
Go!

328
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:02,150
Ok. Sit tight.
Sit tight. Sit tight.

329
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:06,921
Come on, come on..

330
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,425
Yes, that's right.
Check it, check it, check it!

331
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,261
I'm not asking you! I'm not
asking you, all right?

332
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:14,028
I'm telling you!
I'm telling you!

333
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:16,363
Team one,
check your computers.

334
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,232
We got another video
coming through.

335
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,300
<i>I'm sending it to you now.</i>

336
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:21,801
Look at it, look at it,
look at it, look at it.

337
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,275
Relax, okay? I'm going!

338
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:30,643
Don't tell me to relax!

339
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,777
<i>Go!</i>

340
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,481
Good. Come on.

341
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:36,582
Are you kidding me?

342
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,184
Spike, can you tell
where that is?

343
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,585
No. It's a personal webcam.

344
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:41,754
There should be an ip address,
but it's buried.

345
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:43,188
No, no.
Come on.

346
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:46,624
- We're going!
- Go!

347
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:48,793
Boss,
I don't like it.

348
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:50,062
He's playing games
with us here.

349
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,729
I don't like it either, Eddie.
Let's go!

350
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:55,100
Winnie, send cruisers
to 589 Claremont.

351
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,535
We got an armed abduction
in progress.

352
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:57,669
<i>We're on our way.</i>

353
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:59,770
<i>You got it.</i>

354
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:15,018
<i>Okay, team, talk to me.</i>

355
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,520
Boss, I spoke to the
landlord at 589 Claremont.

356
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:19,822
The apartment is rented
to a Rebecca Vaughan

357
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,023
<i>and an Eric Moore.</i>

358
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,992
Hey, boss,
I think I got something,

359
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,995
the guy at the house,
he was also at the truck stop.

360
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,063
<i>He's gotta be
part of that crew.</i>

361
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:28,198
That's a good bet, Ed.

362
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:29,365
Eric Moore.
Busted two years ago

363
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,700
for selling stolen
auto parts.

364
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:32,767
<i>Three months probation.</i>

365
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:34,369
<i>So Eric was in on
this deal, it went bad,</i>

366
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:35,904
and now he's in trouble.

367
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:37,906
That's good; That's starting
to feel like something.

368
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:40,875
Yeah, but it still doesn't
explain who's sending us messages.

369
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,017
Guys, we got it!

370
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,486
Door's ajar;
We're late to the party.

371
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:53,454
Quick and cautious, guys!
Let's move! You ready?

372
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:54,922
Spike, let's go!

373
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,724
Hit it!

374
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:57,725
<i>Right there! Police!</i>

375
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:58,726
SRU!

376
00:15:58,793 --> 00:15:59,760
Police! SRU!

377
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,067
- Clear!
- Clear!

378
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:09,636
<i>Upstairs clear!</i>

379
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:12,071
Spike, I want you on top of the tipster.
Somehow he's at the center of this,

380
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,306
<i>and if we find him,</i>

381
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:14,608
we might find
our abducted couple.

382
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:15,775
Copy that, boss.

383
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:16,976
Detective Travis.

384
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,411
Officer. Sergeant.

385
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,578
Good to meet you.

386
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,079
Any luck with those men
we apprehended?

387
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,681
Zero.
Whoever they're working for,

388
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,950
<i>they're either fiercely loyal</i>
<i>or just terrified.</i>

389
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,585
Boss, I got a pay stub.

390
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,321
Eric Moore is a mechanic
at Apex Freight.

391
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,523
They on your radar?

392
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,324
A mid-sized
transport company.

393
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,026
Above board
as far as I know.

394
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,960
But they'd have
equipment and storage.

395
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,895
They can easily process
hot trucks.

396
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,063
Sure.

397
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,265
Where are they located?

398
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,932
North. Castlefield area.

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,268
That's where the rig
was headed.

400
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,669
Let's pay 'em a visit.
Let's go.

401
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,272
<i>Thanks, Detective.</i>

402
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:12,461
In your office,
boss.

403
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:13,596
Okay.

404
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:20,469
Mr. Burnett,
I can explain.

405
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:22,205
I need you to be quiet, Eric.

406
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:23,271
Have a seat.

407
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:25,207
Where's the girl?

408
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:26,208
In the back.

409
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,309
Get her.

410
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:31,713
Mr. Burnett,
please just let me...

411
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,782
<i>Well, the cops
aren't at the door.</i>

412
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,651
Let's call that good news.

413
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,952
<i>Tell me something, Eric.</i>

414
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,986
You were supposed to drive the truck.
What happened?

415
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:41,888
The guy came out sooner than we expected.
You know, we got caught out of position,

416
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,290
<i>so we switched.</i>

417
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:44,358
Who made that call?

418
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:46,260
I did.

419
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:47,828
So you can see how this
is a bit of a thing for me, Eric.

420
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:48,862
Mr. Burnett, I promise...

421
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,964
you changed plan last minute;

422
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:52,266
<i>The SWAT team arrives;</i>

423
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,067
You're the only one
who got away.

424
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:56,302
Eric; No, look, I swear to you,
everything was running smooth.

425
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,938
Those cops came outta nowhere.
They just showed up!

426
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:02,642
Ah...

427
00:18:05,512 --> 00:18:06,912
<i>It's Rebecca, right?</i>

428
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,913
What's going on?

429
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:09,982
Rebecca,
I'm Eric's boss.

430
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,484
<i>I'm not sure if you know</i>
<i>what that means.</i>

431
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:13,585
I thought you were
a mechanic?

432
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:14,786
<i>That's true.</i>

433
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:17,689
But he has other
responsibilities too.

434
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:20,058
Oh God, Eric, I thought you
left that all behind...

435
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,660
Becca, not now, not now...

436
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:23,729
How could you lie to me
like that?!

437
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,297
No, Becca, just forget about it
for a second, okay?

438
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:26,665
<i>We'll just deal</i>
<i>with it later.</i>

439
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,737
Are you done?

440
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:33,771
<i>Yeah.</i>

441
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,909
Now, it's important to me

442
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:42,012
that you understand exactly
how serious this is.

443
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,480
<i>Mr. Burnett, hang on...</i>

444
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:46,149
Today, Eric
was in charge of a job

445
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:47,484
<i>and it didn't go very well.</i>

446
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,718
No, please, Mr. Burnett...
Please, please...

447
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:50,153
And that's gonna hurt me, see,

448
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,522
because my clients are
a very unforgiving group.

449
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,457
Just please
can you just let us go?

450
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,125
Mr. Burnett,
I swear to you, okay?

451
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:57,427
I'm not the leak!

452
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:58,961
<i>So what's gonna happen now</i>

453
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:02,964
is Eric's gonna tell me exactly
<i>how exposed I am.</i>

454
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:07,836
If I hear one false word...
Listen, okay?

455
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:10,205
There's a security attendant at the truck
stop lot! I paid him to turn a blind eye,

456
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:12,374
and he seemed solid,
but he must've caved.

457
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,209
<i>Okay, that's the only</i>
<i>explanation.</i>

458
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,577
Okay, look, none of this will
go back to the buyers.

459
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,745
I swear to God.

460
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,947
None of it will go back to you.
I'll clean this up.

461
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:21,349
<i>I promise you, okay?</i>
<i>I-I...</i>

462
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,185
<i>I'll bring you the leak.</i>
<i>Just let me do that.</i>

463
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:26,153
Please, let me do that.

464
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,925
You have half an hour.

465
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:32,059
Thank you.
Thank you.

466
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,360
Thank you.

467
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:37,397
No, no. She stays.

468
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:39,633
Wait.

469
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:42,002
You even think of going
to the cops...

470
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,270
I'll kill her.

471
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:45,672
Eric...

472
00:19:57,228 --> 00:20:00,264
Okay, Apex
Freight, established in 1971,

473
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,299
but ownership changed last year.

474
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,769
<i>The new guy</i>
<i>is Terry Burnett.</i>

475
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,436
He took over last year,
you say?

476
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:07,904
Yeah, just
before the truck thefts started.

477
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:09,472
A legit business
gives him cover.

478
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,842
Facilities and payroll,
and a means to launder profits

479
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,243
hiding in plain sight.

480
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,046
Ed, building's located
at the South end

481
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:17,580
<i>of an industrial park.</i>

482
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,549
The intel's spotty.
These places go up as shells

483
00:20:19,616 --> 00:20:20,950
<i>and get filled in</i>
<i>over time.</i>

484
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:23,186
Okay, team, lay up short.
Sam and I'll recon on foot.

485
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:27,522
<i>Jules, Spike,
how you making out?</i>

486
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,891
<i>Rebecca Vaughan.
Steadily employed,</i>

487
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,358
taxes paid.

488
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:31,826
She's currently enrolled
in night classes

489
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,828
<i>at a community college.</i>

490
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,296
<i>Boss, I've isolated the malware</i>

491
00:20:35,363 --> 00:20:38,066
that's hijacked our vehicles
security cameras.

492
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,267
<i>The code's author</i>
<i>goes by the name "rot 2".</i>

493
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:41,703
Weird part is,

494
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,037
there's no mention of him
on the hacker boards.

495
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,839
Is that unusual?

496
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,607
Well, an exploit like
this, it's pretty elite stuff...

497
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:49,142
seizing control of the cameras,
overriding activiation lights.

498
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,476
<i>We're talking the ability</i>

499
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:52,179
to peer into people's homes
undetected.

500
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:54,915
So you're saying there's
an appetite for this technology.

501
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:57,483
I'm saying, in the hacker
world, this guy could be a rock star.

502
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:59,152
But there's no mention of him
or his code,

503
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,653
<i>and nobody's ever</i>
<i>heard of him.</i>

504
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,355
Okay, it's not about fame,
it's not about profit.

505
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:05,557
It's about today.
Can you find him, Spike?

506
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,093
I might be able
to put eyes on him.

507
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,594
How, Spike?

508
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,863
Because I'm gonna turn
his own script against him.

509
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:11,997
<i>Okay. Keep us posted.</i>

510
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:13,632
Did you say
his handle is rot 2?

511
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,400
Yeah, why?

512
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:16,902
Well, she's taking
design class,

513
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,403
the folder's right here
on her laptop.

514
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:21,372
Lessons online
with a tutor.

515
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:23,775
Oh, that's nice.

516
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:25,509
Tutor.
Tutor.

517
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:26,711
Backwards.

518
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:28,512
Rot 2... rot 2.
Tutor backwards.

519
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,513
Rot 2.
You're brilliant.

520
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,749
That's brilliant.

521
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,884
Let's take a look
at one of those lessons.

522
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:37,587
So the guy calls,

523
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,289
<i>saying that he might've</i>
<i>forgotten something</i>

524
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:40,557
<i>at the restaurant,</i>

525
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,659
but he's being all cagey
about what it is.

526
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:43,794
Doesn't actually tell
you what you're looking for.

527
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,395
Exactly.

528
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:47,131
<i>So I go back to the table</i>
<i>and what do I find?</i>

529
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:48,899
I don't know,
I'm guessing not an umbrella.

530
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,100
Teeth.

531
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:51,667
- No...
- Yup.

532
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:52,835
No!

533
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:54,703
Dentures.
Under the table.

534
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,472
Wh-what do you mean,
from his pocket?

535
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:58,007
<i>No, like from his mouth.</i>

536
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:00,076
It had like the glue on them
and everything.

537
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,145
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait...

538
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,746
Teeth are a big part
of your face, Rebecca.

539
00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:05,481
Yes they are, Stuart.

540
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:06,782
<i>Yeah, you see what</i>
<i>I have to deal with?</i>

541
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:08,216
Guy's just a kid.

542
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:09,951
That's why I have to do well
in these classes, Stuart.

543
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:11,086
It's just-it's time

544
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:12,553
I put the waitress life
behind me,

545
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:14,389
once and for all.

546
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:16,724
On that note...
I'm gonna get a tea,

547
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,794
and then you and I are
gonna go back to work.

548
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:20,461
Be back.

549
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:22,497
Hey,
why do you do that?

550
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:24,632
What? Do what?

551
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,100
You always point
the camera away

552
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:27,568
when you get up.

553
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:30,438
I don't want my students
peering into my life.

554
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:33,007
Well, surely I'm not
just another student.

555
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:38,846
Um... Okay, wow. All right.

556
00:22:38,914 --> 00:22:41,881
I thought we had
something special.

557
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:43,183
You are special.

558
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,217
Mmm.

559
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:46,653
I'll be back.

560
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,022
Boss,
I think we've got our hacker.

561
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:50,357
His name's Stuart.

562
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,925
<i>He's got a relationship</i>
<i>with Rebecca.</i>

563
00:22:51,992 --> 00:22:53,560
What kind of relationship?

564
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:55,328
Well, he's her
tutor, but it runs deeper.

565
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:56,595
He's in love with her.

566
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:57,697
Doesn't take a profiler
to see it.

567
00:22:57,764 --> 00:22:58,964
So the hacker loves
the girl,

568
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:00,232
but the girl's
got a boyfriend.

569
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,567
The boyfriend's a crook,

570
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:04,403
- so the hacker tries to get him busted.
- And the whole thing goes sideways.

571
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:05,904
I'm gonna track
down the tutoring company.

572
00:23:08,174 --> 00:23:11,009
They got cover,
vantage, exits...

573
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:12,944
<i>And there's civilian
workers everywhere.</i>

574
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:16,514
Come on, come on...

575
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:20,084
Gotcha!

576
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,221
Boss, I'd like
to introduce you

577
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:26,491
to our hacker rot-2,
first name Stuart.

578
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,692
Jules is getting
more information.

579
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,694
Spike, can we talk to him?

580
00:23:30,762 --> 00:23:32,496
<i>No, I had to modify the
code to get though his defenses.</i>

581
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:34,832
We can hear him,
but he can't hear us.

582
00:23:45,242 --> 00:23:47,877
Come on...
Where are you, Rebecca?

583
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,503
Rebecca...
Rebecca!

584
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,038
Oh my God...
Are you okay?!

585
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:18,572
Stuart!

586
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,409
Spike, can you get it
so we see what he's seeing?

587
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:22,510
Rebecca!

588
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,445
Moments away, boss.

589
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:27,848
<i>Stuart, how did you find me?</i>

590
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:30,718
It wasn't
supposed to go like this.

591
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:33,120
I knew that Eric
was lying to you

592
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:34,754
<i>about where he got</i>
<i>his money from,</i>

593
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,256
<i>about what he does.</i>

594
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:38,025
What're you talking
about?

595
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:40,127
I told-I told the cops.
I told them about Eric's job.

596
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:42,095
You what?

597
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,531
Because I see how he treats you.

598
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:45,966
I've seen it
so many times.

599
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:48,734
I couldn't watch it anymore.

600
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:50,970
What do you mean
you've seen how he treats me?

601
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:53,772
I mean,
you've told me about it.

602
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,942
That's not what you said.

603
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,211
Stuart, how do you know
all this?

604
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:03,182
Have you been spying on me?

605
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,150
I just...
I just wanted to help.

606
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:08,654
<i>Becca, listen.</i>
<i>Please listen to me.</i>

607
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:11,457
I've never met anybody
like you before.

608
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:12,624
We haven't met,
Stuart!

609
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:13,859
I know, I know,
I know.

610
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,226
I know that!

611
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:18,063
I mean, when I...
When I talk to you,

612
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:20,298
I've never felt so close
to anybody

613
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,799
in my whole life.

614
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:22,934
You thought
you'd be my hero?

615
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,802
You thought you'd
just rescue me?

616
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:28,138
<i>Oh God...</i>

617
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:29,440
<i>This isn't some game,</i>
<i>Stuart.</i>

618
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,741
These are dangerous men.

619
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,478
They've got Eric out there right
now, looking for the leak.

620
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:35,212
Do you understand?
They're looking for you.

621
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,347
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

622
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:37,848
Okay.
I'm gonna fix it.

623
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:39,749
I'm-I'm gonna tell the cops
where you are right now.

624
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:40,917
<i>Just don't!</i>

625
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:42,919
Please, if you call the cops,
I'm dead!

626
00:25:42,987 --> 00:25:44,688
Do you understand?
I'm dead!

627
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:47,991
I'm gonna make this right.

628
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:49,392
<i>Rebecca; Don't, okay?
Stay outta this!</i>

629
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,894
Stay outta my life.

630
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,561
Stuart, God,
the last thing I need right now

631
00:25:52,629 --> 00:25:53,562
is more help from you!

632
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,163
I'm sorry, please.

633
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:01,403
<i>Okay, Eddie,
we got a confirmation;</i>

634
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:02,638
Rebecca's inside.

635
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:04,006
She's under threat
of violence.

636
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:05,708
We gotta move.

637
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:07,342
Sam I'm not seeing a clean approach.
They'll spot us coming.

638
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,777
What do you know
about the trojan war?

639
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:11,278
Not much.

640
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:13,280
Me neither.
Let's do it.

641
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,050
<i>Detective Travis, we
need more manpower here.</i>

642
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,653
Copy that.

643
00:26:28,396 --> 00:26:30,163
<i>Hey, you see that?
He's got a slight limp.</i>

644
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:32,165
Yeah, thought I saw some
stiffness in his hand too,

645
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:33,667
same side,
on the left.

646
00:26:33,735 --> 00:26:34,868
<i>One-sided paralysis.</i>

647
00:26:34,936 --> 00:26:36,570
Seems like a stroke.

648
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,104
Okay, Spike, Stuart
tried to play hero today

649
00:26:38,172 --> 00:26:39,105
<i>and it backfired.</i>

650
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:40,806
You gotta get to this kid

651
00:26:40,874 --> 00:26:42,808
before he tries to put himself
further into the line of fire.

652
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:43,843
Copy that.

653
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,355
Hey, what's up!
Aghhh!

654
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:57,355
You thought
you could rat us out?

655
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:58,823
What're you talking about?

656
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:00,258
You have no idea
what kinda trouble you're in.

657
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,597
You stay there, okay?
And shut up!

658
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,033
<i>Eric.</i>

659
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:10,268
I'm the one you're after.

660
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:12,103
<i>Who is this?</i>

661
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:14,905
I'm the one that told the cops
about you.

662
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:16,941
<i>If you let Rebecca go,</i>

663
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:18,642
I can make this
all go away.

664
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,110
How do you know about Rebecca?

665
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:23,447
<i>I know everything, Eric.</i>

666
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:25,215
Let her go.
Deal with me.

667
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:28,085
<i>All right.</i>

668
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:33,623
All right,
just tell me where you are.

669
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:48,346
Sir, I'm gonna need
the truck

670
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:50,015
and the jacket.

671
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:54,219
Stuart's address
. Apartment tower downtown.

672
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:18,542
Okay.

673
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:25,180
Wait. Look... Look,
this is what you want.

674
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:26,682
This is it,
right here.

675
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,916
That's everything I collected
on your operation;

676
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:29,985
That's photos, videos,
transcripts.

677
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:31,354
<i>Everything.</i>

678
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:32,921
I wiped my hard drive.
That's it.

679
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:34,056
No one's ever gonna know.

680
00:28:34,124 --> 00:28:35,691
You here alone?
Yes.

681
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,860
So you can let Rebecca go,
please.

682
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:38,994
Rebecca?

683
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:43,198
Just who in the hell
are you?!

684
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,934
I'm-I'm Stuart.
My name is Stuart.

685
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:48,137
How did you know
about today, Stuart?

686
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:49,537
I studied you.

687
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:51,273
<i>I watched you plan</i>
<i>some of the jobs.</i>

688
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,841
I watched you
plan this job.

689
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:54,409
Oh, you followed us.

690
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:55,978
I didn't follow you,
I watched you on the computers.

691
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:57,011
<i>What?</i>

692
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,081
Why?

693
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:02,183
Eric, come on, man, let's
just get him to the boss.

694
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:05,052
I gave you everything
you need.

695
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,587
On no! Wait!

696
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:07,822
<i>Start talking!</i>

697
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:20,433
Run for your lives!

698
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:21,935
Go, now! Now!

699
00:29:23,871 --> 00:29:25,038
Police! Stop now!

700
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:26,339
Right there!
Hands in the air!

701
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:27,808
On the ground!

702
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,309
On the ground now!
Stay there!

703
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,580
Don't move!

704
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,917
Get down on
the ground now!

705
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:41,287
Leah, with me!
Let's move!

706
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:47,192
Take the stairs.

707
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:58,436
Bottom of the South stairs
clear and contained.

708
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:01,604
You stuck your nose
into something, Stuart,

709
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:05,042
and you don't just get
to walk away now!

710
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,544
Becca...

711
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:10,513
What is this?

712
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:12,816
What is it?

713
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:17,654
It's gotten to the point
where I,

714
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:19,956
I ask how his day was,

715
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:22,959
and he gets defensive
with me.

716
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:25,027
It's like by just expecting him
to say words,

717
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:27,664
I'm pointing out
some kind of defect.

718
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:29,499
No, that can't work.

719
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:31,968
You're the only one that's putting
any effort into the relationship.

720
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:33,269
It's not like that.

721
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:34,470
<i>It sure seems like that.</i>

722
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:35,871
It's not.
I mean, he gets me, you kn??

723
00:30:35,938 --> 00:30:38,073
He knows me.
He knows what I need to work on,

724
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,475
what I need to improve on.

725
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:41,877
He tells you
what you need to improve on?

726
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:43,445
He's right.

727
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:45,146
I mean,
he makes mistakes too.

728
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:46,548
<i>Stuart</i>
<i>yeah, he stole cars.</i>

729
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:48,517
Stuart, that was in the past.
He's changed.

730
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,284
<i>Do you believe that, Becca?</i>

731
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:53,388
Or do you just...
Wanna believe that?

732
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,332
Oh wow.

733
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:09,403
Stuart, it's starting
to come together for me.

734
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,704
<i>Once you get me</i>
<i>out of the picture</i>

735
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:12,005
and she runs into your arms...

736
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:15,074
Is that the basic idea?

737
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:16,510
<i>Well, you know,</i>

738
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:19,746
full points for taking
your shot there, Stuart.

739
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:22,214
I just-I just got
one question.

740
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,752
What kind of twisted fantasyland
do you live in, man?

741
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,253
Aghhh!

742
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:29,755
<i>You know, all that talk...</i>

743
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:30,823
<i>What, you think that means</i>
<i>that she's into you?</i>

744
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,425
That it means you're safe?

745
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:33,559
Agh!

746
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:35,528
It means you're nothing.

747
00:31:35,595 --> 00:31:37,930
You're not an option,
Stuart.

748
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,564
<i>You're a girlfriend to her.</i>

749
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:43,302
A buddy... A gimpy,
lonely little buddy...

750
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,471
Eric, let's go, man.

751
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,909
Tell me one thing...

752
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,477
How often did you
spy on her?

753
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:53,711
<i>That's not what it was for.</i>

754
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,346
You're telling me
you never snuck a look?

755
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,314
No.
No?

756
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,781
No.

757
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,952
Maybe when she was undressed to
take a shower or changing for work?

758
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,386
I swear.
I swear.

759
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,955
Late some night,
you're feeling lonely, right,

760
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,789
so you turn on the computer
just for a second, right?

761
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,160
There's no harm, right?
You just wanna see her.

762
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,594
Yeah,
maybe watch her sleep,

763
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:13,796
watch her breathe.

764
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:15,265
Oh yeah.

765
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,168
Did you tell her that,
Stuart?

766
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,487
Did you share that with
your special friend?

767
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,705
That you are a sick,
lying pervert

768
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:24,507
did you do that?

769
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,908
I lost my job
because of you!

770
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:28,410
I lost my girlfriend.

771
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:30,412
I lost everything
I've worked for!

772
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,580
Everything!

773
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:33,748
You pathetic! Little! Puke!

774
00:32:33,816 --> 00:32:35,484
<i>Okay.</i>

775
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:37,686
Stay away!

776
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:43,391
Come on, come on.

777
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,669
- Eric!
- Get off!

778
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,105
Get off!

779
00:32:57,172 --> 00:32:59,106
Come on! Come on!

780
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,775
- Let's go!
- Get off!

781
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:04,311
Do you want some more?!

782
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:05,379
SRU! Get down
! Get down on the ground!

783
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:06,779
Down on the ground!

784
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:09,282
Get down on the
ground right now!

785
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,950
<i>Hands on your back!</i>
<i>Hands on your back!</i>

786
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,793
<i>Don't you move!</i>

787
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:23,996
Subject located!

788
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:25,231
Second floor!

789
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,266
<i>Drop your weapon!</i>

790
00:33:28,402 --> 00:33:29,201
<i>Drop the blade!</i>

791
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:30,301
Weapons down!

792
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:33,371
Okay.

793
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:36,607
Drop the gun!
Do it now!

794
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:45,250
Stuart?! Where'd you go?

795
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:47,684
Stuart?!

796
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:51,588
Stuart! Wait!

797
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,655
Stuart!

798
00:34:00,723 --> 00:34:02,423
No! Just don't! Don't!
Don't come near me!

799
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:04,591
<i>Okay, man, I'm
gonna stay right here!</i>

800
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:06,192
Stuart, you were trying
to help someone

801
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,728
you care about today.

802
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,863
You were trying to put
some bad characters behind bars.

803
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:11,798
Those are noble goals.

804
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:17,270
I saw you
on the road today.

805
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:18,739
<i>You're the one</i>
<i>who looked in the camera.</i>

806
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,906
That's right.

807
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:22,408
How do you know
what I did today?

808
00:34:22,475 --> 00:34:24,243
I spied on you.

809
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,478
<i>I tapped into your webcam.</i>

810
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:28,915
I used your program
against you,

811
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:31,617
and I went into
your private video files.

812
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:34,854
Then you know that Rebecca's
in trouble because of me,

813
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:38,557
because of my stupidity,
and my lies...

814
00:34:38,624 --> 00:34:39,658
<i>Isn't she?</i>

815
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:41,660
Isn't she?!

816
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:47,066
No! No!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

817
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,500
<i>Stuart! Stuart!</i>

818
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:49,935
Don't come any closer now!

819
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:51,270
<i>Put the gun on the floor!</i>

820
00:34:51,337 --> 00:34:52,770
Do it now!

821
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:53,737
Terry Burnett.

822
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:54,905
Back off, now!

823
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:57,575
My name's Greg Parker.

824
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:58,709
Oh, you've got
yourself in a bit of a fix,

825
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:00,244
haven't you,
Mr. Greg Parker?

826
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:02,113
How's that, sir?

827
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:03,714
Well, I'm not gonna give
up and you're not gonna shoot me.

828
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:05,450
I don't wanna shoot you.

829
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:06,984
No, you are not gonna shoot me.
You can't shoot me.

830
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:08,619
That's how this works.

831
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:09,720
Okay. You wanna
talk me through that, sir?

832
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:10,921
It's real simple.

833
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:12,489
You put a bullet in me,

834
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:14,224
I can still squeeze off
a shot.

835
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,826
<i>It'll be my last gesture</i>
<i>on earth.</i>

836
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:17,494
Hell, it could just be
a muscle spasm.

837
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:19,797
<i>Could be my finger hitting</i>
<i>the trigger on the way down.</i>

838
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:21,131
<i>Either way,</i>

839
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,333
it does make a difference
to this girl...

840
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,401
And her blood'll be
on your hands, Parker!

841
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:27,070
<i>So I'll tell you what.</i>

842
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:30,073
Tell your guys to back down,
clear me a path,

843
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,107
and let me outta here.

844
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:32,809
I can't do that just yet, sir.

845
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:35,745
Look, I am not interested
in standing around, Parker!

846
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:36,946
<i>Just stay there!</i>

847
00:35:37,014 --> 00:35:38,414
<i>I'm not going anywhere!</i>

848
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:40,016
<i>Listen to me...</i>

849
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,783
<i>You took a chance today.</i>

850
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,619
You looked out
beyond your life

851
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:46,188
and you imagined
something better,

852
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:47,590
<i>and you went for it.</i>

853
00:35:47,657 --> 00:35:50,226
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>Maybe it was foolish,</i>

854
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:51,560
maybe you overreached.

855
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:52,861
Yeah, you think?

856
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:55,231
But the point is it happens.

857
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:59,000
My God, Stuart,
it happens all the time.

858
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,901
<i>When the heart's involved,</i>
<i>we botch things up.</i>

859
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:03,271
<i>It's how we're wired.</i>

860
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:05,973
But the thing is
it can all be made better...

861
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,074
all of it.

862
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:08,709
<i>You know why?</i>

863
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:11,246
Because you acted out of love.

864
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:12,713
<i>And when you do that,</i>

865
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,716
<i>those mistakes you make,</i>
<i>they can be corrected...</i>

866
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:17,351
<i>all of it...</i>

867
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:19,620
<i>Now, you made some</i>
<i>questionable choices today</i>

868
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,722
<i>that you are gonna feel</i>
<i>bad about for a while,</i>

869
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,490
but there is one choice
you coulda made

870
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:24,591
that you would have
regretted forever.

871
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,493
You know what that is?

872
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,763
It's doing nothing.

873
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,531
<i>Doing nothing is easy,</i>
<i>Stuart.</i>

874
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:34,600
To hide away,
to put up walls.

875
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:39,673
The hardest part
is reaching out,

876
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,775
and you did that.

877
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:44,343
<i>You took that chance.</i>

878
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,779
Today is a beginning;

879
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:48,747
It's not an end.

880
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:50,348
All right, we're ready to
move this thing along, Mr. Burnett,

881
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,318
but you need to know something
first.

882
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:54,887
You need to know
that there are targets...

883
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:57,422
clusters of nerves,
lobes in the brain,

884
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,725
that'll put a person down
instantly.

885
00:36:59,793 --> 00:37:02,194
<i>We call these kill points.</i>

886
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,795
<i>You hit one</i>
<i>and there are no last gestures,</i>

887
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:05,096
<i>no muscle spasms.</i>

888
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:06,398
You just switch off
like a light.

889
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:09,801
<i>Now they're small,</i>
<i>these kill points...</i>

890
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:11,269
about the size of a dime...

891
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:13,838
but to these three officers
aiming at you right now,

892
00:37:13,906 --> 00:37:16,575
who spend fourteen hours a week
in a gun range

893
00:37:16,642 --> 00:37:18,442
<i>training for</i>
<i>just this situation,</i>

894
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,278
<i>they look like beach balls.</i>

895
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:23,847
<i>We're about to move to</i>
<i>the next stage of this thing,</i>

896
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:25,249
Mr. Burnett,

897
00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:27,585
so you tell me...
How do you want this to go?

898
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:44,100
Put the gun on the
floor right now, Mr. Burnett,

899
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,101
and step away from the girl.

900
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:46,168
Do it now!

901
00:37:46,237 --> 00:37:47,470
Yes, sir!

902
00:37:47,538 --> 00:37:49,239
Thank you, sir!
That's a good choice.

903
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:50,606
- On your knees!
- Get down right now!

904
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:52,241
- On your knees!
- Get down! Get down!

905
00:37:52,308 --> 00:37:53,675
Yes, yes, yes!

906
00:37:54,644 --> 00:37:56,612
It's okay, it's okay.

907
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,813
Kill points?

908
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:01,216
Just came to me in the moment,
Eddie.

909
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:03,552
Spike, subject is secure.
Hostage is safe.

910
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,919
<i>Rebecca is safe.</i>

911
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:07,588
Stuart, Rebecca is safe.
My sergeant just told me.

912
00:38:08,557 --> 00:38:09,724
<i>She's unharmed.</i>

913
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:15,195
Okay...

914
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:21,235
It still doesn't excuse
what I did...

915
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,704
It doesn't mean
she's gonna forgive me.

916
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:25,772
Maybe not.

917
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:32,312
I'm no good out there.

918
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,781
<i>No. That's
where you're wrong.</i>

919
00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:36,015
Yeah?
How do you know?

920
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:38,885
Because I watched you
with Rebecca

921
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:40,552
and I saw how you
talk to her,

922
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,054
<i>and I saw your honesty,</i>

923
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:43,589
<i>your generosity,</i>

924
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,357
and I saw an open heart.

925
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:48,060
And I saw you listen...

926
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,528
<i>And you know what,</i>
<i>Stuart?</i>

927
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:53,032
That's it;
That is the ball game.

928
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,300
If you can do that,

929
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:56,802
everything else,
it will come.

930
00:38:58,237 --> 00:38:59,437
You really believe that?

931
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,039
Oh, I know it.

932
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:03,775
You and I,
we're not so different.

933
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,743
Yeah, right.
Look at you.

934
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:07,578
It's mostly gear.

935
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:10,782
Trust me.

936
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,722
You think you can
come over on my side?

937
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,491
<i>I'd feel a lot better</i>
<i>about that.</i>

938
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,196
You used my own
malware against me, huh?

939
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,797
It's a beautiful
piece of code.

940
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,598
<i>It's hugely illegal</i>
<i>on so many levels,</i>

941
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:32,468
but it's really...
It's quite spectacular, buddy.

942
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,905
Can you come back
on my side?

943
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,140
Come on.

944
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:41,344
Right here.
I've got you, bud.

945
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:44,512
<i>There you go.</i>

946
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:47,749
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

947
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:01,628
♪ maybe we'll come back
some day ♪

948
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:07,468
♪ you see how we've grown ♪

949
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:12,106
♪ carve our names
on everything ♪

950
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,308
Rebecca...

951
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:18,478
I am so sorry.

952
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:19,913
Who did that to you?

953
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:21,214
It doesn't matter now.

954
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:23,850
Did Eric do that,
Stuart?

955
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:25,886
Yeah.

956
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,627
I was worried about losing
your friendship.

957
00:40:37,597 --> 00:40:41,566
You think maybe we
could just start over again?

958
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:42,734
I don't know.

959
00:40:42,802 --> 00:40:44,403
Can we be straight
with each other?

960
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,604
Yeah.

961
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:48,439
You see the fingers
on this hand?

962
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:50,308
From a stroke.

963
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,810
I've known for ages.

964
00:40:52,878 --> 00:40:54,612
Are you kidding me?
How?

965
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,846
Because I called
your supervisor

966
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:57,681
after our first session

967
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,284
to tell him
how great you are

968
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:01,152
and he told me.

969
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:06,556
I... Okay.

970
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:08,491
Well, in terms of big,
scary revelations,

971
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,160
that's kinda
my best card.

972
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:12,462
So...

973
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:24,773
Hey, Winnie.

974
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:26,608
Hey, what's up?

975
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,213
Are you all right?

976
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,149
Uh, what? Yeah.
No. Uh...

977
00:41:33,216 --> 00:41:36,685
It's just, it's been brought
to my attention that...

978
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:40,589
Wait, rewind.

979
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:44,793
Would you like to go out
to dinner with me sometime?

980
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:47,529
Spike,
you're asking me out?!

981
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:49,698
I am.

982
00:41:49,766 --> 00:41:51,732
Well, I don't know
what to say.

983
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,768
Tongue-tied;
That's gotta be a good sign.

984
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:57,304
Yeah, no... I just...
Um, I'm flattered,

985
00:41:57,372 --> 00:42:00,174
but I don't date cops.

986
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:01,709
Ever?

987
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:04,712
I'm sorry.
It's just my rule.

988
00:42:05,647 --> 00:42:06,681
Okay.

989
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,684
Just so I know,
is this one of those rules

990
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:14,053
where you use it
just to let guys down easy?

991
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:15,254
No!
No?

992
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:16,322
Like one of those rules

993
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,624
where the perfect guy
comes along

994
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:19,993
and the rule would go
out the window?

995
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,027
No, no, no.

996
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:23,696
It's one of those rules
that...

997
00:42:23,763 --> 00:42:27,933
It just reminds me that
I need balance in my life.

998
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:30,836
I mean, the perfect guy
just came along.

999
00:42:36,877 --> 00:42:38,043
Okay.

1000
00:42:43,716 --> 00:42:46,450
♪ I've got something ♪

1001
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:49,554
♪ you've got something ♪

1002
00:42:49,622 --> 00:42:54,559
♪ we've got something ♪
