1
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:08,709
Hayes:
<i>But you weren't actually there</i>

2
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:09,643
<i>when your daughter died,
were you?</i>

3
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:10,530
No.

4
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:12,713
You said yourself,
Frank has a temper.

5
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:14,653
(Sighs) Everyone gets
frustrated sometimes.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,521
Not everybody punches walls.

7
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:17,689
Tell me again,

8
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:19,058
why did your husband
punch the wall?

9
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,659
He was tired.
It was work...

10
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:23,362
He was tired like the night
that your daughter died?

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,596
I didn't say that.

12
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:25,730
And he was alone
with your baby.

13
00:00:25,798 --> 00:00:27,631
She was crying,
she wouldn't stop.

14
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,300
Now, isn't it possible that,
in his frustration,

15
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:31,035
Frank picked up
your baby girl...

16
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:32,703
(Whimpers)

17
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:35,673
That he picked up Taylor
and he shook her?

18
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,008
(Sobs)

19
00:00:37,076 --> 00:00:39,944
Now, isn't that possible
Mrs. McCormick?

20
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:41,879
(Quietly) Yes.

21
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:43,347
Yes, what?

22
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:45,115
(Heavy sigh)

23
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,185
Yes, it's possible.

24
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:53,690
Darren: Listen to me.
Frank: Son of a bitch!

25
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:54,858
Frank!

26
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:56,059
He twisted everything she said!

27
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:57,627
It was a mistake
to put Kerry on the stand.

28
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:59,462
She's my wife!
It hurt the case!

29
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,163
Look, you need to start
preparing yourself.

30
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:02,564
I am not going to jail!

31
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:03,699
You need to get
your head together,

32
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,634
show some remorse.

33
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:06,835
<i>Frank: I'm not gonna let you
do it, you son of a bitch!</i>

34
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:08,237
Guard:
<i>Let's go.</i>

35
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,039
Kerry! Kerry!

36
00:01:10,107 --> 00:01:13,042
<i>Guard: C'mon on, sir.
Come on.</i>

37
00:01:13,977 --> 00:01:15,076
Kerry!

38
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:18,113
(Frustrated grunt)

39
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:32,325
It gets easier,

40
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,362
being separated from your girl.

41
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,464
Yeah.

42
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,498
Conjugals, right?

43
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,567
Voss, no talking.

44
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,071
How long you goin' away for?

45
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,072
Guard:
<i>Voss, what'd I tell ya?</i>

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,573
Hey, my buddy here's upset.

47
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,109
(Wheel blows out)

48
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,276
(Hard impact)

49
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,915
(Tires skid on pavement)

50
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,122
Guard 2:
Anyone hurt?

51
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,322
Guard:
<i>What happened?</i>

52
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,423
<i>Open up!</i>

53
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,994
(Pained grunt)

54
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,483
You made it.
Have I ever let you down before?

55
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:14,617
Whoo!

56
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:17,687
You comin'?

57
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:27,430
Ed: Really?
I bought ice cream last night.

58
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,465
Sophie, I'm not giving you
a hard time.

59
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,267
Look, you are pregnant,
you are beautiful,

60
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:33,402
and you should eat
whatever you want.

61
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,870
Send Clark out
to get some more.

62
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,706
<i>I gotta go.</i>

63
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,008
I gotta go, I gotta go.

64
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,209
Parker:
You talking to Sophie again?

65
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:42,710
How many times
has she called today?

66
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,545
I lost count.

67
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:45,746
Wordy: <i>Which stage is she at
The "get me this" stage,</i>

68
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:47,582
or the "do you still love me"
stage?

69
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:49,650
Parker: <i>Or the "I'm fat and
it's your fault" stage?</i>

70
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,152
Wordy:
<i>It's worth it,</i>

71
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,487
once you hold 'em in your arms
for the first time.

72
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:53,921
<i>Winnie: (Over P.A.)
Team One, hot call!</i>

73
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:56,090
Armed prisoners escaped
from a transport van.

74
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:57,592
Ed: Where?
Winnie: Leslie and Eastern.

75
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,059
Ed: How many on board?
Winnie: Two prisoners.

76
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,427
They escaped with an unknown
accomplice.

77
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:01,729
Issue a citywide alert

78
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:03,063
and get me a manifest
for that van.

79
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:04,599
We need to know
who we're dealing with.

80
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,901
Winnie: Getting that
for you right now.

81
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:11,371
<i>Winnie: (Over radio) The escaped prisoners
are Frank McCormick and Carl Voss.</i>

82
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,473
McCormick.
Isn't he the airline pilot?

83
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,108
The guy accused
of killing his baby.

84
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:16,209
<i>Winnie: He was headed
back to city jail.</i>

85
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:17,644
His verdict
isn't until tomorrow.

86
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:19,312
What about Voss?

87
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,279
<i>Winnie: Voss.
Voss committed armed robbery,</i>

88
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,815
assault with a deadly weapon...

89
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:23,216
<i>He was being transferred
back to Kingston Pen.</i>

90
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,050
Maximum security.
Thanks, Winnie.

91
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:29,755
Tires are shredded.

92
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:31,857
Might have something
to do with this.

93
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:32,992
Spike strip.

94
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:35,494
This was planned.

95
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,129
Do Voss and McCormick
know each other?

96
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,397
<i>Guard:
It sure seemed like it.</i>

97
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:39,498
They were talking.

98
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:41,065
Thanks.

99
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,902
You think Voss and McCormick
are in on this together?

100
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:47,238
Well, they're both lookin'
at serious time.

101
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:49,507
Hey, Spike, you got anything
on the van's camera?

102
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:51,809
Screening the footage now.

103
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:55,279
Okay, here we go.

104
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,480
The three men left the van
heading in the same direction.

105
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,750
You get an image
of the accomplice?

106
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,885
<i>Spike:
Just the back of his head.</i>

107
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,219
Wait a second.

108
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:04,621
I got a late-model sedan
leaving the scene,

109
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:05,822
<i>heading south.</i>

110
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,323
Spike, are all three men
in the car?

111
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,026
Tinted windows.
Hard to tell.

112
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,094
<i>I do have a plate number
though.</i>

113
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:12,562
Registered to?

114
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,797
Spike: Rick Marinelli.
Career criminal.

115
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,065
<i>Did some time with Voss.</i>

116
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,034
<i>B&E's,
two armed robberies...</i>

117
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:20,102
Okay, any connection
to McCormick?

118
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,237
Nothing I can see.
McCormick's record's clean.

119
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,073
This is Voss' breakout.

120
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,407
<i>Parker: He had his buddy
Rick help him out.</i>

121
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,509
Yeah, and took their new buddy
Frank with them.

122
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:30,311
Winnie, alert the airports,
train and bus station.

123
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,080
Emphasis on airports,

124
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,348
<i>both private and commercial.
Our guy's a pilot here.</i>

125
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,517
And let's get an APB out
on Rick Marinelli's car.

126
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:37,986
Copy that.

127
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:38,987
Ed: Spike, look into
Voss and Marinelli.

128
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:40,288
If this thing is planned,

129
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,489
somebody knows
where they're headed.

130
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:42,857
You got it.

131
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:44,424
<i>Ed: Let's get these guys.
Parker: Okay.</i>

132
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,794
<i>Ed: We're gonna start
at the courthouse.</i>

133
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:49,997
(Sirens wailing)

134
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:51,799
Hey, Winnie, can you patch me
into McCormick's lawyer?

135
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,601
Comin' right up, Jules.

136
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,868
<i>Parker: McCormick wasn't
expecting to be free today.</i>

137
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:56,169
<i>He's thinkin' on his feet.</i>

138
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:57,270
He could have jacked a car.

139
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,505
Winnie's checking
for any vehicles

140
00:04:58,573 --> 00:04:59,806
reported stolen this morning.

141
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,273
Jules,
any luck on Frank's lawyer?

142
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,675
She's on the phone
with him now.

143
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:04,143
Winnie, patch me into Jules
and the lawyer.

144
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,812
You got it.

145
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,179
<i>Jules: Any idea where
he might've gone?</i>

146
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,482
My guess? As far away from here
as possible.

147
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:10,516
<i>He did not want
to go back to jail.</i>

148
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,851
How did Frank's daughter die?

149
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,952
<i>Darren:
She was six-months-old.</i>

150
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,587
Frank thought it was sids.

151
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,688
He went to check on Taylor,
found her dead in the crib.

152
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,389
<i>But the coroner ruled it
a homicide.</i>

153
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:19,858
Shaken baby syndrome.

154
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:22,027
Would you say Frank
has a temper?

155
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,729
Look, the guy is angry,
all right?

156
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:25,497
He feels like
he was railroaded.

157
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:27,599
This prosecutor,
Adrian Hayes, he's a pitbull.

158
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,200
<i>He's got a perfect
conviction rate.</i>

159
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,702
Do you think Frank's angry
enough to want to hurt him?

160
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,737
After this morning,
I wouldn't be surprised.

161
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:34,338
What happened this morning?

162
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:35,606
<i>Darren: I put Frank's
wife on the stand.</i>

163
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,341
I thought if the jury
could see her

164
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:38,408
standing by her husband,

165
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:39,476
it would help our case.

166
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:40,945
But Mr. Hayes ripped her apart.

167
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,546
Frank must've been upset.

168
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,381
Bailiff had to restrain him.

169
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,916
<i>Spike:
Boss, I've got a lead.</i>

170
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:47,451
Yeah, Spike?

171
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,218
Found a boat registered
to Rick Marinelli's brother.

172
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:51,420
<i>He keeps it docked
at Ashbridge's Bay.</i>

173
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:52,822
Good way to get outta town.

174
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,924
Dump the car,
head for international waters.

175
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,159
<i>Ed: (On headset)
Change of plans.</i>

176
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:57,493
Team one,
head south to the lakeshore.

177
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,129

Cherry Street, southbound.

186
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:16,511

188
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,151
<i>Sam:

189

<i>Ed:
I'll try to head him off.</i>

Let's do it.

199
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,531
Step out of the car, now!

200
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,433
Jules: Out of the car!
Sam: Turn the engine off!

201

Jules: Open the door, now!

Do it now!</i>

209

Ed: (lnto headset) We got Voss
and Marenelli in custody.

210
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:34,652
Wordy:
McCormick's not in the car.

211
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,653
Where is he?

212
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,721
How the hell should I know?

213
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:37,755
Where is he?

214
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:38,922
He didn't go with you?

215
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,724
No, but I'd give you a ride.

216
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,125
These cuffs tight enough
for ya?

217
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:44,427
All right, you let McCormick
out of the van,

218
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:45,795
then what?

219
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,931
He took the guard's gun
and he ran off.

220
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:52,736
All units be advised

221
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:56,072
Frank McCormick is not yet
in custody.

222

Frank?
What're you doing here?

227
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:55,975
Why do you have a gun?

228
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,510
You're packing up
all my stuff already?

229

It's not yours.

230
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,054
You're getting rid

I can't keep it here.
I can't...

232
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:14,192
I can't look at it
every single day.

<i>It's been six months,

234

We should be going through
all this stuff together.

235
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:21,832
We shouldn't be
doing it at all.

236
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:28,105
Sorry.

237
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:29,406
You think I did it.

(Dialling 9-1-1)

239
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,886

Wordy and Spike
sweeping the second.

241
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:47,656
If Frank's here,
we're gonna find him.

242
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:48,857
That's good.

Hayes:
What's going on?

246
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,596
Parker: Frank McCormick
escaped earlier today.

247
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:56,032
Yeah, they told me.

248
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:58,534
Sir, we need to put you
in protective custody.

249
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:01,236
Okay, fine.
I get it.

250
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:02,504
Thank you, sir.

251
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:03,171
I understand McCormick
threatened you

252
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,605
in court today.

253
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:06,374
He wasn't happy with
how things turned out.

254
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:07,542
His lawyer claims
he's innocent.

255
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,177
Innocent men don't run.

256
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:10,845
I got the top coroner
in this country telling me

257
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:12,547
that this guy shook his baby.

258
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:15,016
Even McCormick's own wife
thinks he did it.

259
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,451
McCormick's lawyer said
she testified on his behalf.

260
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,520
Yeah, didn't turn out that way.

261
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:20,620
<i>Kerry:
He was tired.</i>

262
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,390
Did your husband
want this child?

263
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,958
Of course he did.

264
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,726
Was he happy when you told him
that you were pregnant?

265
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,863
Was he happy?!

266
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,231
Mrs. McCormick,
tell me again,

267
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,033
why did your husband
punch the wall?

268
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,535
He was tired.
It was work...

269
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,737
he was tired like the night
that your daughter died?

270
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,639
(Muffled cry)

271
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,508
The seed of doubt
was already there.

272
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,876
I just exposed it.

273
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,211
Sam:
He's not in the building.

274
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,812
Thank you,
Mr. Hayes.

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,845
Ed: Mr. Hayes, we're gonna
get you to go

276
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,281
with these two officers here.

277
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,415
All right.

278
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,584
What's going on?

279
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,586
McCormick's wife turned on him
in court today.

280
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,155
Ed: Okay, Team One, let's move.

281
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,524

Kerry: (Answering machine)
<i>Hi, you've reached the McCormick's.</i>

284
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,295
<i>Leave us a message
after the beep.</i>

286
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,965
Winnie, I can't get through
on the McCormick's home line.

287
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:09,500
<i>It keeps going to voicemail.</i>

288
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,268
I know.
We got a 911 in progress.

<i>Parker:

290
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,004
Coming right up.

291
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,306
This is Sergeant Greg Parker

292
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:16,873
with the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

293
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,242
Mrs. McCormick?

294
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,013
<i>She's not responding.</i>

295
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:26,949
(Sirens wailing)

296
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,724
(Sirens wailing)

297
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,371
Ed: You got it?
Parker: Yup.

298
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:02,250
Ed:
Bravo team, in three...

299
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:03,917
Two... one.

300
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,686
(Ram smashes door)
Ed: Police! Police!

301
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:07,387
Jules: Police!
Sam: SRU!

302
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:08,921

308
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,772
Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,240
Garage is empty.

310
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,843
He took her.

311
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:34,813
(Tires squealing)

312
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:37,249
Frank:
Just keep going straight.

313
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:42,587
Frank, the police are looking
for you.

314
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:44,822
<i>You should turn yourself in.</i>

315
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,958
They stack us three to a cell,
three feet wide.

316
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:50,261
I get the floor.

317
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:51,696
My head's next to a toilet,

318
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:53,798
but that's not why
I don't sleep at night.

319
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:55,032
<i>You know what they do
to people</i>

320
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,433
<i>that are accused
of killing kids?</i>

321
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:59,703
<i>The thing that kept me going
all this time...</i>

322
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,872
Was knowing that you
still believed in me;

323
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,242
That no matter
what anybody else said,

324
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,876
you believed in me.

325
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,212
You knew the truth.

326
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,880
What I said in court...

327
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:15,084
Frank: Wh-what you said in
court, you can't take back!

328
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:16,885
(Takes steadying breath)

329
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:19,722
Sam: Winnie, we need
to put out an APB

330
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:21,156
on Kerry McCormick's car.

331
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,057
<i>Winnie: Copy.
Jules: If he was gonna hurt her,</i>

332
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,259
he'd have done it here.

333
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,927
Unless he caught her
dialing 911.

334
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:26,929
Spike, you pick anything
off that 911?

335
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:28,162
<i>Spike:
Working on it.</i>

336
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,831
(Cell phone ringing)
Everything okay?

337
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,066
Soph, you need to rest.

338
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:34,369
You shouldn't be on your feet
so much. Look...

339
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:36,070
Sophie, I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

340
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:37,171
Okay, bye.

341
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,406
Kerry didn't talk
to the operator,

342
00:13:38,474 --> 00:13:39,807
but she left the phone on
the whole time.

343
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,809
I've boosted the gain,
so we got something.

344
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,577
Jules: Can you turn it up?
Spike: Yep.

345
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:44,945
<i>Kerry:
What was I supposed to think?</i>

346
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:46,413
<i>Frank:
I told you I didn't do it!</i>

347
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:47,514
<i>Kerry: What about what
the doctor said?</i>

348
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:48,549
<i>Frank:
You believed her?</i>

349
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,651
<i>Kerry:
She's an expert!</i>

350
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,119
<i>Frank:
Where are your car keys?</i>

351
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:54,020
<i>Kerry:
Here. Just take them. Go.</i>

352
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,088
<i>Frank:
You're coming with me.</i>

353
00:13:55,156 --> 00:13:56,957
<i>Kerry:
No, Frank.</i>

354
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:58,925
<i>Kerry: Let go!
Frank: Come on!</i>

355
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:00,326
<i>Jules: Frank's lawyer said
that there were two doctors</i>

356
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:01,661
involved in the case.

357
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:03,028
There was the uh...

358
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:04,364
The ER doctor who pronounced
the baby dead

359
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:05,831
and the coroner
who performed the autopsy.

360
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,867
And both lawyers mentioned
the coroner's testimony.

361
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,602
The wife called her an expert.

362
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,471
Jules: The top forensic
pathologist in the country.

363
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,506
Parker: Yeah, and her testimony
helped turn his own wife against him.

364
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:15,074
Maybe Frank's looking
for payback.

365
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:16,508
What's the name
of that coroner?

366
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:17,709
Dr. Roberta Fenton.

367
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:18,843
Her office is
at the city morgue.

368
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,078
All right, let's get moving.

369
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,613
Winnie, patch me through
to security

370
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,782
at the coroner's office.

371
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:26,752
(Phone ringing)

372
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:31,522
Security.

373
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,757
<i>Ed:
This is Ed Lane</i>

374
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:34,158
with the Police
Strategic Response Unit,

375
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:36,327
is Dr. Fenton
in the building?

376
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,461
Yes.

377
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:38,763
Okay, we have reason to believe

378
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,331
that an escaped prisoner
named Frank McCormick

379
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,299
<i>may be looking for her.</i>

380
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:42,733
I see.

381
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,268
<i>Ed: Subject's a
white male, 30s,</i>

382
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:46,704
<i>maybe accompanied by
a white female of the same age.</i>

383
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,938
Any sign of them?
Have you seen them?

384
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:50,973
<i>Security guard: Actually,
I think I see them now.</i>

385
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,009
<i>Ed: Okay, stay calm.
If you can stall him, do so.</i>

386
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:55,111
But the priority here
is to cooperate.

387
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,446
He's armed
and emotionally unstable.

388
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,148
<i>We're on our way.</i>

389
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,983
Thank you very much.

390
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,986
Can I help you?

391
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:12,719
(Police sirens wailing)

392
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,629
Wait a second,
what's down here?

393
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:25,398
Security guard: Oh, nothing.
It's uh... It's just labs.

394
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,667
<i>You know, uh, maybe we should
check out the third floor.</i>

395
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:29,267
It says autopsy.

396
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:31,603
Sir, we uh...
We don't even use...

397
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:34,639
Autopsy. Now!

398
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,583
<i>That's her.
That's Dr. Fenton.</i>

399
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,717
Open it.

400
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:48,719
Open it!

401
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:50,922
(Keys jangle)

402
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:56,160
(Indistinct chatter)

403
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,664
Dr. Fenton:
Frank McCormick?

404
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:03,000
Frank:
Back away from the table.

405
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,134
<i>Dr. Fenton:
Oh my God.</i>

406
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:05,735
Just do what he says, please.

407
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:07,404
Dr. Valo: What's going on here?
Dr. Fenton: Just stay calm.

408
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:09,506
<i>Dr. Valo:
Sir, could you please-</i>

409
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:10,941
<i>Dr. Fenton:
Try to stay calm.</i>

410
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:15,545
My wife thinks
that I killed my daughter...

411
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:18,114
And you're gonna show her
that she's wrong.

412
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:19,515
Mr. McCormick,
I know you're upset...

413
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:21,083
don't patronize me.

414
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:22,718
<i>Sorry.</i>

415
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:24,787
I want you to go and find
my daughter's autopsy report,

416
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:27,924
I would you to take
a very good, close look at it,

417
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:30,159
and I want you to find
the mistake that you made.

418
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:31,693
(Shouting) Do it!

419
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:43,704
Frank, please.
You don't need to do this.

420
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:45,206
This isn't-
(Scoffs)

421
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,080
Frank: Let me see it.
Bring it over here.

422
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:54,949
It contains autopsy photos
of your daughter

423
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:57,451
that I didn't show in court.

424
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,053
It could be very upsetting
for you,

425
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,188
<i>and for your wife.</i>

426
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,226
(Sighs heavily)

427
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,734
How many people we got in here?

428
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:16,869
More then a hundred.

429
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,237
We got offices
on the upper level,

430
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,872
and the autopsy suites
in the basement.

431
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,873
Wordy:
We need a full evac.

432
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,540
It's underway.

433
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,010
I'm bringing in more uniforms
to lock down the perimeter.

434
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,178
This is the guard.

435
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,346
Hey, we talked on the phone.

436
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,680
Where's Mr. McCormick now?

437
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,015
Autopsy one,
with the woman he came with

438
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,149
and another coroner.

439
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,451
Ed:
Sam, Wordy, with me.

440
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,119
Parker:
Spike, set command post up here.

441
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,354
We'll need blueprints
of the building.

442
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,988
On it.

443
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,622
Parker: And a way to communicate with Mr.
McCormick.

444
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,557
The building's equipped
with an intercom system.

445
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,493
I can hook it
into the headsets.

446
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,494
Okay, it'll have to do.

447
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:44,561
Let's hurry up, guys,

448
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:46,297
McCormick's hanging
by a thread.

449
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,798
He's just lost his child,
his wife,

450
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,800
and now, he's about to lose
his freedom.

451
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,039
(Door squeaks open)

452
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:03,179
Boss, we got a visual.

453
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:08,351
Got a cam on the window.

454
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:13,022
<i>Parker:
Entry options?</i>

455
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,156
<i>Wordy:
Door's stainless steel.</i>

456
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,091
Too heavy for a ram...

457
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,859
We can't risk a charge,

458
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,594
<i>not with the chemicals
in there.</i>

459
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:21,296
There's an extensive
air vent system.

460
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,431
<i>One in every room.</i>

461
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:23,665
You wouldn't know it
from the smell.

462
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,333
Breathe through your mouth.

463
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:28,602
I'm uploading blueprints
to your PDAs.

464
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:34,975
Okay, there's a duct above
the autopsy suite.

465
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:37,412
Best entry's through the roof.

466
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,147
<i>You're gonna have to rappel.</i>

467
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:41,415
<i>Ed: Okay, Sam, this
can go both ways.</i>

468
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:42,982
Bring a strobe and CS gas.

469
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:44,584
I'm on it.
I'll spot him?

470
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:45,685
Let's do it.

471
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,892
The C.T. scan
of your daughter's brain

472
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,062
indicated severe swelling.

473
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:56,796
See this area here?

474
00:18:56,864 --> 00:19:00,199
<i>There's a pooling of blood
at the base of her skull.</i>

475
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,567
You must've mixed up the scans.

476
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:03,035
This is-
this is someone else's.

477
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:04,736
It's got her name on it.

478
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:06,338
<i>Dr. Fenton: As I said in
court, those symptoms,</i>

479
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:07,806
along with retinal hemorrhages

480
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:10,276
comprise something called
shaken baby syndrome triad.

481
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:12,010
<i>No.
I'm sorry.</i>

482
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,411
I'm very familiar
with the syndrome.

483
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,680
I did not shake my baby!

484
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,182
I wish I had
another explanation.

485
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,683
(Heavy sigh)

486
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,785
<i>Parker:
Frank McCormick,</i>

487
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:24,122
<i>Greg Parker,
Strategic Response Unit.</i>

488
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:28,493
I need to make sure
everyone in there is okay.

489
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:29,626
Talk to him.

490
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,330
<i>He can hear you.</i>

491
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:35,632
I don't need a SWAT team,

492
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,334
<i>i just need some answers.</i>

493
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:39,836
<i>Parker: Okay. Okay, Frank.
I understand that.</i>

494
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:41,371
But in the eyes
of the law right now,

495
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,207
you're still an innocent man.

496
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,408
You still stand a chance
at trial.

497
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:49,145
Nobody believes me.
They only believe the expert.

498
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:51,147
Sir, is it possible
to get copies

499
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:52,181
of the McCormick files?

500
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:53,316
Yeah, they're in the archives.

501
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:54,617
Okay, great.
Can I see them?

502
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,119
And everything you have
on Dr. Fenton!

503
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:00,423
'Kay, Spike, we're on the roof.
Which vent is it?

504
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,390
You want the main intake vent,
south side.

505
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,492
Copy.

506
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:08,363
Sam, in position?

507
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:09,897
We see it.

508
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:18,038
(Drill whirs)

509
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:22,876
All right.
(Sighs heavily)

510
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:25,812
I know it's hard
to lose a child.

511
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,015
Frank: It's even harder
having everybody thinking

512
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:29,750
that you killed her,

513
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:31,785
including your wife.

514
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:33,086
<i>Parker: Hard time for
both of you, Frank.</i>

515
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,855
You've both been through...
A lot.

516
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:38,791
Line secure?

517
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:39,925
I got ya.

518
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:43,363
(Rope straining)

519
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:54,406
<i>Parker: I mean, how long
have you been together?</i>

520
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:55,440
Five years.

521
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:56,574
<i>Parker:
Five years?</i>

522
00:20:56,642 --> 00:20:58,576
Five years you get
to know someone.

523
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:04,715
First night we met,

524
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:07,418
she looked me right in the eye,

525
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:10,388
like she already knew me.

526
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,822
And then today on the stand,

527
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,025
she says she doesn't know
anymore.

528
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:17,927
You think I wanted
to believe that?

529
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:20,463
Parker: Kerry, I think Frank just
wants a chance to be heard here.

530
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,964
You made them think
I didn't even want her!

531
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,233
You didn't!

532
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:24,201
Like I didn't want
to get married?

533
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:26,035
Not at the beginning.

534
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,370
You didn't tell them
the next part.

535
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:31,106
The part after I held her
in my arms for the first time

536
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:34,176
and saw her little chin,
and her...

537
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:39,014
Eyes that looked
just like yours.

538
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:40,916
I loved her.

539
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:42,117
I loved her.

540
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:43,219
I know.

541
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:49,390
Sam:
Almost there.

542
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,728
Hey, Frank,

543
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:56,364
I can tell that you love
your daughter.

544
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:59,166
<i>I'd like to hear your side.</i>

545
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,236
<i>Can you tell me what happened
the night your she died?</i>

546
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:06,806
(Sighs heavily) I-I was looking
after Taylor because uh...

547
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:09,710
Kerry was with her mom
at the hospital.

548
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:11,077
(Taylor crying)

549
00:22:12,813 --> 00:22:14,448
<i>I'd just come off
a fourteen hour flight.</i>

550
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:17,450
<i>I didn't realize
how exhausted I was.</i>

551
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:20,085
<i>Taylor was...
She had a cold.</i>

552
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:22,054
<i>She wouldn't stop crying.</i>

553
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:27,493
I tried bouncing her
because she always loved that,

554
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:28,661
but it didn't work.

555
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,496
<i>(Taylor crying)
Nothing worked.</i>

556
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,166
(Crying)

557
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:36,901
<i>So I tried to put her
in her crib.</i>

558
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:38,836
<i>Uh, let her cry it out.</i>

559
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,272
<i>You know, that's what
you're supposed to do, right?</i>

560
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,807
<i>You, you let 'em cry.</i>

561
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:47,512
<i>But she wouldn't stop.</i>

562
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,912
<i>I was a wreck -</i>

563
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,749
from the crying,
from the flight...

564
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:56,052
and uh...
I-I had a glass of wine.

565
00:22:57,955 --> 00:23:01,091
I dozed off for, maybe,
half an hour.

566
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,294
And when I woke up,
it was quiet.

567
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:10,199
<i>As soon as I went in
to check on her,</i>

568
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:11,367
<i>i knew that there was
something wrong.</i>

569
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:12,302
<i>I mean...
(Exhales sharply)</i>

570
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:14,637
<i>She wasn't breathing.</i>

571
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:18,874
I called 911, I tried CPR.

572
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,243
Her little lips were... cold.

573
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,147
<i>(Exhales sharply)</i>

574
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,883
She was gone.

575
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:33,789
My little girl was gone.

576
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,397
(Sucks air in through his teeth,
huffs out)

577
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,700
She just stopped breathing.

578
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:49,903
It had to have been SIDS.

579
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,206
Dr. Valo: SIDS doesn't cause
the brain to swell and bleed.

580
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:56,643
Well something does, right?!
Something does!

581
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,177
And it wasn't me!

582
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,815
Spike, we've got a problem.

583
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:03,350
What's that?

584
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:05,284
Sam: The vent to the
autopsy room is blocked.

585
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:07,320
<i>He'll hear me
if I try to cut through it.</i>

586
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,455
That wasn't in
the original blueprints.

587
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:11,089
Where else can we gain access?

588
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:12,391
<i>Spike:
There. Histology.</i>

589
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,925
<i>Ed:
What is that?</i>

590
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:15,126
It's where they store and test
blood and tissue samples

591
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:16,595
for ongoing cases.

592
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,430
Which way, Spike?

593
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,566
<i>Spike: Sam, make your way
50 feet along the duct</i>

594
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:21,767
<i>to the next shaft.</i>

595
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,868
Copy that.

596
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:29,073
He's questioning the evidence
in his daughter's case.

597
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,408
We tell him to go to histology

598
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:32,710
so that Fenton can retest
the samples...

599
00:24:32,778 --> 00:24:34,812
And make Frank feel like
we're on his side.

600
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,447
And what happens
when the tests are done?

601
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:38,282
Parker: He's not gonna find
what he's looking for.

602
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,517
He's gonna be a danger
to everybody in there,

603
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:41,251
he's gonna be a danger
to himself.

604
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:43,186
Okay, boss,
let me do a face-to-face here.

605
00:24:43,254 --> 00:24:45,822
I can connect with him,
I can keep him grounded.

606
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:49,726
All right, Eddie.

607
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:50,927
Okay, I'm gonna go in unarmed.

608
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:52,529
<i>Parker:
No, I don't think so.</i>

609
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:55,031
<i>Ed:
Greg, you know how it works.</i>

610
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:58,033
I'm not gonna earn his trust
walking in there with an MP5.

611
00:24:58,101 --> 00:24:59,668
I can cover him, boss,

612
00:24:59,736 --> 00:25:02,337
<i>and Ed can give you eyes in.</i>

613
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:04,139
Okay.

614
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:07,476
Sam, you don't take
your eyes off of him.

615
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:09,077
<i>Sam:
Copy that.</i>

616
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:14,849
Which way, Spike?

617
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,083
<i>Spike:
Turn to your right.</i>

618
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:17,652
Copy that.

619
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,253
Yeah, how do I know
you're not gonna just shoot me

620
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:20,988
the second I walk out the door?

621
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:22,990
<i>Parker: We wanna resolve
this peacefully, Frank.</i>

622
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:29,329
Okay.

623
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:31,865
Thank you, Frank.

624
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,404
<i>Dr. Fenton can handle
the retesting.</i>

625
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:39,907
So why don't you let Kerry
and Dr. Valo go?

626
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:42,543
No, I'm gonna make everybody
stay with me.

627
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,777
I want him to check the results

628
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,979
'cause I'd like
a second opinion.

629
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:50,550
They're coming out.

630
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:00,926
'Kay, I'm in position.

631
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,833
Frank:
Stay back!

632
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,935
Jules:
This is just procedure, Frank.

633
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:27,785
It's right there.

634
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,687
Frank:
Get in, get in. Go.

635
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:36,125
(Slams door)

636
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:38,695
Frank, I am unarmed.

637
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:40,797
What are you doing here?!

638
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,665
My name's Ed Lane.

639
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:44,354
I just want to talk.

640
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:54,648
I don't like Ed being in there
unarmed.

641
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:55,749
I can't see him,

642
00:26:55,817 --> 00:26:57,450
my view's limited
against the wall.

643
00:26:57,518 --> 00:26:59,619
<i>Parker: Spike, we have to
get Jules in position.</i>

644
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:00,720
Jules, I can get you an angle,

645
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:02,022
give you more access
to the room.

646
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,390
Show me.

647
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,292
<i>Spike:
Here's Sam in the air vent,</i>

648
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,393
<i>and you'll get a view
to histology</i>

649
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,528
<i>through this window.</i>

650
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:09,962
Got it?
Got it.

651
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,398
All right, Sam,
Jules' on her way.

652
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,966
Copy that.

653
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,101
Seconds away.

654
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,369
Okay, calm down.
Just calm down.

655
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:18,804
I want you outta here now.

656
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,105
Frank, take it easy.

657
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:21,373
<i>Frank:
Get out now!</i>

658
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:23,942
This is not what we discussed.

659
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,812
Jules: I can see him, Sam.
We're covered.

660
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,582
Frank, I'm a father,
just like you are.

661
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,849
<i>Okay?
Just like you are.</i>

662
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,384
<i>Now, believe me,
if I were you,</i>

663
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,786
I would want answers too.

664
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,288
Now, doc,
where are those samples?

665
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,823
(Stammering) Uh, the freezer.

666
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,458
Let's test them, please.

667
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:56,840
<i>Spike: Ed, camera's
in a good position.</i>

668
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:59,075
<i>Ed: That's it. That's it.
Thanks, doc.</i>

669
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,277
Eddie, make sure he sees
the slides are Taylor's.

670
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,279
I don't want him thinking
we're pulling a fast one.

671
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:07,450
Sam: This is a problem.
I'm 20 percent blind here.

672
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:08,718
<i>Jules:
I got him, Sam.</i>

673
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:10,219
All right,
let's hold one second.

674
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:13,389
Let's make sure that those
are the right samples.

675
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:15,023
Okay, Frank?

676
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:22,664
<i>Fenton:
Taylor McCormick.</i>

677
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:28,503
(Sighs) That's my little girl.

678
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:31,806
<i>That's all that's left
of her.</i>

679
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:34,809
<i>Ed: Frank, they're doing
what you want here.</i>

680
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:37,277
Do you think you can go ahead
and put that gun down?

681
00:28:37,345 --> 00:28:39,913
Not until these tests are done!

682
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:41,382
<i>Ed:
Okay.</i>

683
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:44,418
Well, let's let 'em
do their thing, okay?

684
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:45,586
Let's let 'em do their thing.

685
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:46,887
Doc, go ahead.

686
00:28:51,392 --> 00:28:53,393
<i>Fenton:
Try this.</i>

687
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,568
<i>Spike: This doctor's not used
to needing second opinions.</i>

688
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:04,970
She's a gold standard
in forensic pathology.

689
00:29:05,906 --> 00:29:07,672
<i>Frank's theory that
she might be wrong...</i>

690
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,775
<i>Parker:
Wishful thinking, I know.</i>

691
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:11,576
Eddie, find common ground;

692
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:14,379
<i>I'm worried what happens
when they finish those tests.</i>

693
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:21,386
I bet she was a good mom.

694
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:25,289
<i>Frank:
Yeah.</i>

695
00:29:27,426 --> 00:29:28,959
She was beautiful.

696
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:32,430
<i>Patient.</i>

697
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,669
(Sighs) She fed her
and she changed her...

698
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:44,240
Got up in the middle
of the night.

699
00:29:46,877 --> 00:29:49,111
She always cried
when you gave her to me.

700
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:50,847
You were away.

701
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:54,951
She didn't know your smell,

702
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:57,152
so she wanted me.

703
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:59,154
<i>Ed:
Those first few months,</i>

704
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:00,889
it's all about mom.

705
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,793
<i>Kerry:
You got it, though.</i>

706
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:06,762
In your own way.

707
00:30:07,664 --> 00:30:09,030
He sang to her.

708
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:12,132
Frank:
She liked classic rock.

709
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:15,135
Stones, Eagles...

710
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:18,105
Good taste.

711
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:23,377
I always thought I'd take her
to her first concert and...

712
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:25,813
(Takes deep breath)

713
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:27,981
Teach her how to play guitar.

714
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:36,389
I didn't even get to go
to her funeral.

715
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:41,361
<i>Ed:
You know, Frank,</i>

716
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:44,697
whatever those test results say,

717
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,168
they're not gonna bring
Taylor back.

718
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:57,843
Wanna have a look?

719
00:31:00,813 --> 00:31:01,880
Okay.

720
00:31:02,781 --> 00:31:04,883
(Takes calming breath)

721
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,250
Dr. Valo:
Okay.

722
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,825
This is an image
of Taylor's brain cells.

723
00:31:13,893 --> 00:31:16,760
<i>There's evidence of edema,
hemorrhage.</i>

724
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:18,595
Consistent with injuries
sustained

725
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:19,763
during a violent trauma.

726
00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:21,732
There was no violent trauma!

727
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:25,502
We could retest the samples
a thousand times,

728
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,604
<i>the results won't change.</i>

729
00:31:27,672 --> 00:31:29,139
Science doesn't lie.

730
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:31,674
Frank: B-but I do, that's
what you're saying?

731
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:32,909
<i>Ed:
All right, look,</i>

732
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,376
is there anything else,
anything at all,

733
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:35,978
that would've caused
these symptoms?

734
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:37,947
Yes.
Uh, a vitamin C deficiency,

735
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:39,214
<i>Barlow's disease...</i>

736
00:31:39,282 --> 00:31:40,716
<i>But those all came back
negative.</i>

737
00:31:40,784 --> 00:31:42,618
Run the tests again.

738
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:44,687
<i>Dr. Fenton:
There's no need.</i>

739
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:46,221
<i>Frank: Nobody's leaving
until you test it again!</i>

740
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:47,656
Get back!

741
00:31:47,723 --> 00:31:49,090
Ed: Frank! Frank!
Put the gun down now!

742
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,091
Put it down!

743
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,459
I did not kill my child.

744
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:52,961
<i>Ed:
Let's slow it down here.</i>

745
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:54,195
(Shouting) I was there!

746
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:55,530
Sam? Jules?

747
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:57,298
He's out of range.

748
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:58,433
I'm out of range.

749
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,334
<i>Adjusting position.</i>

750
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:01,436
Ungh!

751
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,671
(Thud echoes through ducts)

752
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:06,173
<i>Frank:
What was that?</i>

753
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,542
(Alarm blares)

754
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,110
Jules: No solution.
I've got no view.

755
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,144
<i>Parker:
What just happened?</i>

756
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:12,412
He hit lockdown.

757
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,781
It activates
the ventilation system.

758
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,649
<i>Sam, get outta there now!</i>

759
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,208
Frank, take it easy.

760
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:23,076
<i>Frank: You had a guy up
there this whole time,</i>

761
00:32:23,144 --> 00:32:24,511
<i>pointing a gun at me?</i>

762
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:26,680
<i>Jules: Ed's not covered,

763
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,315
<i>Frank:
You lied to me?</i>

764
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:30,250
(Struggling grunts)

765
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:31,818
Sam, status?

766
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:32,952
He's still on the line.

767
00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:35,688
(Grunting)

768
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,089
I'm okay.

769
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:38,524
But I don't have a view.

770
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:40,426
Spike, can you try to override
the ventilation system?

771
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:41,894
Spike: There's do or do
not; There is no try.

772
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,228
Can you kill the alarm?

773
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,597
Security guard:
Yes! Yes, sir. One sec.

774
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:45,931
<i>Frank:
What are they doing up there?</i>

775
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:47,032
<i>You said you were
just here to talk!</i>

776
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,534
<i>Ed:
Take it easy, Frank.</i>

777
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:49,968
He's here to keep me safe,
he is not here to hurt you.

778
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:51,536
You had a guy in the ceiling
this whole time?!

779
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:53,605
Frank, just stop.
Stop fighting.

780
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:54,739
<i>Dr. Fenton:

Don't you talk to me.

00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,475
Keep testing.

783
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,210
Dr. Fenton:
The facts don't lie.

784
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:00,878
<i>Frank: I know what
happened that night!</i>

785
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,414
I could never have hurt Taylor.

786
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,815
You loved her so much,

787
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,082
you couldn't live
with the memory

788
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,718
<i>of what you did.</i>

789
00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:08,719
N-no.
No, no, I couldn't.

790
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:10,454
<i>I couldn't have.</i>

791
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,622
<i>Parker:
Eddie, this is delicate here.</i>

792
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,424
He needs to know
he's not alone.

793
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,158
Spike. I know, boss.
I know.

794
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:24,200
Kerry, Frank said that
when he met you,

795
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:26,402
that you could see
right into him;

796
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,471
<i>That you knew him.</i>

797
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:31,840
<i>Can you tell him
what you think</i>

798
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:34,376
may have happened that night?

799
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:38,313
You were exhausted.

800
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:40,949
You got home,
you just needed to...

801
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:43,719
Lie down,
close your eyes, rest.

802
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,155
But she was crying and crying
and your nerves were raw.

803
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:48,823
You had a, a drink.

804
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,625
You tried everything
to make her stop crying.

805
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:53,026
<i>So you bounced her</i>

806
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,696
<i>'cause that worked
most of the time,</i>

807
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:57,197
<i>and she loved that,</i>

808
00:33:57,265 --> 00:34:01,402
and maybe you bounced her harder
than you realized.

809
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:05,805
No. No, it was...
It was the normal bounce;

810
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:07,106
<i>The way I always did it.</i>

811
00:34:07,174 --> 00:34:09,843

812
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:13,913
<i>Kerry:
Dr. Fenton, is it possible</i>

813
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:16,015
that that could've
caused those...

814
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,185
Those injuries that you saw?

815
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:21,086
Yes, it's...
It's possible,

816
00:34:21,153 --> 00:34:22,554
<i>Kerry:
Then if that's what it was,</i>

817
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:25,891
<i>then maybe
it was just an accident.</i>

818
00:34:26,826 --> 00:34:30,462
And accidents just...
It happened,

819
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:36,467

And now it's over.

00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,074
believing you're innocent
or knowing you're guilty?

876
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,076
Nah, you don't forget
you killed your kid.

877
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:44,211
Oh, I think he did.
I think that he blocked it out.

878
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:45,279
<i>Sam:
He was as good as convicted.</i>

879
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,313
He had a ticket to freedom,

880
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:47,514
but instead of running

881
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:48,948
he turned around and went home.

882
00:37:49,015 --> 00:37:50,349
Spike: 'Cause it wouldn't
have been freedom,

883
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,185
leaving behind a wife
who thinks you're a killer.

884
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,920
(Disconnects call)

885
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:57,457
Parker:
Dr. Valo on the phone.

886
00:37:57,524 --> 00:37:59,459
<i>Reporter: Although the baby
had all the classic symptoms</i>

887
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:01,194
<i>of shaken baby syndrome,</i>

888
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:03,162
<i>the coroner neglected
to administer a test</i>

889
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,796
<i>called a "gram stain,"</i>

890
00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:07,299
which would have led
to a different diagnosis:

891
00:38:07,366 --> 00:38:09,167
<i>Bacterial meningitis.</i>

892
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:11,436
The baby had a cold
that caused an ear infection.

893
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:14,372
Dr. Fenton overlooked it,
but Dr. Valo didn't.

894
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,241
Taylor wasn't shaken.

895
00:38:16,942 --> 00:38:20,044
<i>Reporter: Dr. Fenton, why
didn't you run the extra test?</i>

896
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:22,012
There was no need.
The evidence was conclusive.

897
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,380
<i>Reporter: How do you feel
about the suggestion</i>

898
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:25,983
<i>that your other cases
may be reopened?</i>

899
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,952
The sample was contaminated.
There's no other explanation.

900
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,254
(Turns off TV)

901
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:34,558
So Frank was innocent
all along.

902
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:35,659
Tell me we haven't had days

903
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:38,495

904
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:43,166
