1
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:06,911
<i>Okay, team,</i>
<i>officer's wife is targeted.</i>

2
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:09,480
Let's find her
and keep her safe.

3
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:24,294
Honey,

4
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:25,395
we gotta go!

5
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:26,997
What?! What's wrong?

6
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:28,665
I'll explain later.
Come on.

7
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:33,669
Just be quick!
We'll meet out here.

8
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:34,737
Okay.

9
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,341
<i>Leah, you're with me!</i>
<i>Spike, Sam, north side!</i>

10
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:46,648
No!

11
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:53,755
<i>Okay, Dean,</i>

12
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:55,590
this assignment
is threat level one.

13
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,392
Means it's the lowest level.

14
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,027
<i>Trust me,</i>

15
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:01,029
it took weeks to convince my dad
to let me come on a ride-along.

16
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:02,197
When he finally said yes,

17
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:03,464
I knew it'd be something
like this.

18
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:05,966
Okay, Winnie,
Data Logger 8033

19
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,002
just passing Waypoint 3.

20
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,536
Copied and logged,
Team One.

21
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:11,405
Two minutes ahead of schedule.
Hmm.

22
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:12,572
How's the package?

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,474
Oh, he's lively as ever.

24
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:17,778
<i>Check if he's breathing.</i>

25
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,280
So you report in along the way?

26
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:20,679
Well, Winnie charts
our progress,

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,615
and then if we were
to miss a call,

28
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,850
she would know
where to send backup.

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:25,885
Like if we're ambushed?

30
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:26,886
Yeah.

31
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,554
Cool.

32
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,056
You know we're not gonna be
ambushed though, right, Dean?

33
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:31,657
Yeah, I know.

34
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>Dad told me that escort calls</i>
<i>are pretty quiet.</i>

35
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:36,361
What did you say
to convince him anyway?

36
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,730
I told him how much Clark
wanted to come;

37
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,932
<i>how he really wanted</i>
<i>to ride with him.</i>

38
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,167
You got any questions, Clark?

39
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,368
I'm good.

40
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,203
You sure?
Just feel free to ask.

41
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,206
Clark
nah, it's cool.
I'm just uh...

42
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,108
Picking it up as we go along.

43
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,310
Man of few words,
like your dad.

44
00:01:52,377 --> 00:01:53,911
Yeah. Yeah, right.

45
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,313
No?

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,415
Me like my dad?
Nope, not at all.

47
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:58,649
I don't know.
I wouldn't be so sure.

48
00:01:58,716 --> 00:01:59,951
<i>I see a lot of Ed in you.</i>

49
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,118
Yeah, you want
a police question?

50
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:02,453
Here's a police question,
all right?

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,587
<i>Parker all right, go ahead.</i>

52
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:05,289
The guy we're taking
to the hospital,

53
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:06,590
he defrauded people
out of millions of dollars,

54
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:07,591
ruined their lives.

55
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,591
That's right.

56
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,126
He's a douchebag.

57
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:12,262
I believe that was
the court's finding, yes.

58
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,464
Okay. So why are you
going through all this trouble

59
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:16,199
to help him?

60
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:17,200
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he gets a security detail,</i>

61
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:18,835
medical treatment...

62
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:20,770
It's our job.

63
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:22,538
To be bodyguards for some jerk?

64
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:23,973
We're not judges, Clark.
We're police.

65
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,574
We uphold the law.

66
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,138
Get down!
Get on the ground!

67
00:02:58,206 --> 00:02:59,772
Get on your knees!
On your knees!

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,475
<i>Get down!</i>
<i>Down on the ground!</i>

69
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:03,076
Get down!

70
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:04,811
Get down!
Come on, get down!

71
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,812
No funny business!

72
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,280
Hands behind your back!

73
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:09,416
All right, get up!
Up! Up!

74
00:03:09,484 --> 00:03:10,783
In the other room!

75
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:12,585
Get in the other room!
Go! Go!

76
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:14,621
All right, let's do it!

77
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,982
Uh-oh!
Look what I got!

78
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,689
Jackpot! Got it!

79
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,425
Whoa!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

80
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,529
You guys got an arsenal
in here!

81
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:02,032
Give me a hand with this.

82
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,769
Look at this stuff!

83
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:09,539
Hey! Tally it up!

84
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:11,541
Damn...

85
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:15,912
<i>About a pound and a half.</i>

86
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,713
Twenty-two an ounce
times twenty-four ounces...

87
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:19,415
That's...
That's over 50k!

88
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:23,647
Whoa!
Fifty thousand dollars.

89
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,055
Well, you guys are more
important than you look.

90
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:27,223
<i>How much is there?</i>

91
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,958
A little over $2200.

92
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,427
- You know how much this cost?
- $3.99.

93
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:33,095
You're crazy...

94
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:35,130
- Yeah, I know.
- I coulda got it cheaper, but...

95
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:36,798
I like to shop local.

96
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,601
Do you guys have any
idea who you're messing with?

97
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,002
Yeah, we do.

98
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:44,172
Christopher Gearing, your boss.

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,340
<i>Tell him we came.</i>

100
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:46,941
Yeah, I'll tell him.

101
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:48,610
You think those masks
will protect you?

102
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:50,311
You know the best thing
about you guys?

103
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:52,045
No matter how big the talk,

104
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:53,647
you all get real quiet
at this point.

105
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:02,389
<i>Let's go!</i>

106
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:07,793
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Get back! Get back!

107
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,596
Take cover!
Take cover!

108
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:10,530
<i>Take cover!</i>
<i>Come on, get down!</i>

109
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:11,664
<i>Get down!</i>

110
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:18,338
<i>Okay, guys, if this was</i>
<i>a high-risk scenario,</i>

111
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,373
<i>the most likely place</i>
<i>for an attack is right here...</i>

112
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:22,341
The transfer point
between a vehicle

113
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:23,342
and the building.

114
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:24,676
Can you tell me why?

115
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:25,710
More exposed.

116
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:27,078
Right. Good.

117
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:30,882
Can you be more specific?
Uh, what else do you see?

118
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,951
Parking garage.
Could be a sniper perch.

119
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,086
Right. Now, what we do
is take a diamond formation

120
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:36,688
around the subject.

121
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:38,456
We'd have a spotter on overhead
to check the threats.

122
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:40,191
What else?

123
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:43,327
Those garbage cans -
could be concealing an IED.

124
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:44,795
This hospital serves the prison.

125
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:47,064
They've got a bomb unit
doing regular sweeps.

126
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,199
And we'd clear all that
stuff out ahead of time...

127
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,702
The garbage cans, mailboxes,
all of it.

128
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,336
<i>What else?</i>

129
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:54,471
Uh...

130
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:55,873
Clark, you wanna chime in?

131
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,007
On what?

132
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,810
Well, threat assessment.

133
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:01,679
Threat assessment?

134
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:02,912
Like from here to the door?

135
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,946
That's right.

136
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:06,416
Uh... shin splints?

137
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:20,829
Team One, hot call!

138
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:23,899
Shots fired -
519 Sackville Street.

139
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,335
Multiple gunshots.
Repeat, multiple gunshots.

140
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:27,703
Winnie, we're on it.
Let's move.

141
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,938
Okay, boys, you're with me!
Come on!

142
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:39,748
Hey!
I got an exit.

143
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,249
Come to me.

144
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:54,895
Aghhhh!

145
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:05,773
Team, let's hold up here.

146
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,776
Okay, stay in the truck.
Lock the doors.

147
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:11,010
Oh, come on!
But dad...

148
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:12,579
Do not move,
you hear me?

149
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,501
What's going on?
What can you tell us?

150
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:36,736
Shots came from inside
that building,

151
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,036
but it's been quiet
since we arrived.

152
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,304
All right.
Seal off the block,

153
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,772
the whole area's hot.
Keep everyone out.

154
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,206
Yes, sir.

155
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,841
Sam, Leah -
move up recon.

156
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:44,842
Copy.

157
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,010
Spike, give me floor plans.

158
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:47,445
Coming up.

159
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:53,685
Hey, Greg.

160
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:54,952
<i>How come every time I see you</i>

161
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,153
someone's shooting up
the neighbourhood?

162
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,655
It's your division, Matt,
you tell me.

163
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:58,855
Staff sergeant Matt McGrath,

164
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:00,658
Ed Lane, my team leader.

165
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:01,725
<i>So what are we
looking at? Domestic?</i>

166
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:02,959
<i>It's not domestic.</i>

167
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,528
911 said there's
more than one gunshot here.

168
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:06,530
And now quiet...

169
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:07,898
Maybe the shooters
got what they came for?

170
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,166
Or it's a stalemate.

171
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:13,736
We should move up,
see what's going on.

172
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:15,438
Dude.
Come on. Why not?

173
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:17,273
You heard my dad.
We were told to stay.

174
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:19,609
Uh, we were told we were
going for a ride-along today.

175
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:20,976
I'm pretty sure this doesn't
feel like a ride-along.

176
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:22,445
What do you care?

177
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:23,946
This is just supposed to be
a day off school for you.

178
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:26,482
Exactly! So shouldn't it suck
a bit less than school?

179
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:28,750
You wanted to see
police work up close,

180
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:30,285
didn't you?

181
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:32,354
Right! Well, the way I see it,
Dean Parker,

182
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,790
there are two types of people
in this world:

183
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,124
the sitting in
the truck type...

184
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:38,427
- Yeah...
- And the other type,

185
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:39,628
and I don't think

186
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:40,429
you're the sitting-
in-the-truck type,

187
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:42,664
I really don't.

188
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,131
Come on.

189
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:45,265
We have to keep
a safe distance.

190
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,567
Absolutely.

191
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:48,168
And we have to get back
before they are.

192
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,437
- Okay.
- Here.

193
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,106
We'll need these.

194
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:54,608
So we can hear what's going on.

195
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,344
Make sure you turn off transmit
so they can't hear us.

196
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:58,912
- Clark...
- Yeah...

197
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,013
You do know how pissed
my dad's gonna be

198
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:02,615
if he knows that
we're gone, right?

199
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,884
Yeah, about half as pissed
as mine.

200
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,653
Let's go.

201
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:09,556
<i>Window broken outward...</i>

202
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:10,724
<i>Looks like our hot zone, Ed,</i>

203
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,258
<i>second floor, east side.</i>

204
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,627
Residential suite floor
plans coming your way.

205
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:16,362
Main entrance has cover;
That's our approach.

206
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,029
Sam, let's form up!

207
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:44,255
Hurry!

208
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:52,962
<i>Spike, Jules,</i>
<i>sweep and clear.</i>

209
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,631
<i>- Got it!</i>
<i>- Sam, Leah - with me.</i>

210
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:55,965
Hey, look.

211
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,734
There's a guy coming out
of the building.

212
00:09:57,802 --> 00:09:59,736
<i>On point. No surprises.</i>
<i>Use extreme caution.</i>

213
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,204
<i>Let's move.</i>

214
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,609
Ted... Ted...

215
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:10,045
Ted, come on,
stay with me, man, stay...

216
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,014
Oh no...

217
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:31,433
Team, 10-33 inside
the building.

218
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,100
<i>Repeat, 10-33.</i>

219
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:34,402
What does that mean?

220
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,669
It's 10-33...
Officer down.

221
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:36,837
<i>Ed;</i>
<i>Team, new deal.</i>

222
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:39,873
Hard entry now!
Let's move! Move!

223
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:41,274
They're going in blind?

224
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:43,260
They don't have a choice.
Officer down.

<i>- Drop it!</i>

00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,399
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

241
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,034

00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,969
<i>Eddie!</i>

243
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,569
<i>Ed, status?</i>

244
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,972
<i>Eddie!</i>

245
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:52,911
<i>All clear!</i>

246
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,046
<i>I need EMS now!</i>

247
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,681
Please, you gotta help him.

248
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,719
What's the status
of the downed officer?

249
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:03,787
Gunshot wound to the chest,

250
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,189
but he's still breathing.

251
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:06,489
He's critical.

252
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:12,562
All right, man.
Let's go.

253
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,663
Hold on.

254
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,233
Look.

255
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:20,736
Is that the guy who came down
the fire escape?

256
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:21,971
<i>Yeah. I think it is.</i>

257
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:39,620
Let's get outta here.

258
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:47,294
You were just walking by?

259
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:48,830
We heard shots,
we intervened.

260
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:51,031
They just opened up on us.

261
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:54,501
I should go with him.

262
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,102
No, he's in good hands,
and we need you right here.

263
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:58,972
Nobody on that side's talking.

264
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,106
Why didn't you call
for backup?

265
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:01,241
It all happened really fast.

266
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:02,743
So you broke protocol?

267
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,644
Look, we reacted, okay?

268
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:05,945
I mean,
in case you hadn't noticed,

269
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,146
my partner just took one
in the chest,

270
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,882
so maybe you could just...

271
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,549
just back off an inch or two,
okay?

272
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,451
Okay, okay.
Sit tight.

273
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:18,023
Boss, something's
not adding up.

274
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:21,326
Two plainclothes officers,
guns in hand, no ID.

275
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:22,895
So what, they just happened by?

276
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:24,430
That's the claim,

277
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:26,431
but the officers are pretty deep
inside the apartment.

278
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,366
Bad guys got between them
and the door.

279
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,301
All right, keep at him.

280
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:32,704
I'm gonna see
if there are witnesses.

281
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:34,305
We have to tell them
what we saw.

282
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:36,708
Oh no, no, no.
That's not gonna happen.

283
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:38,576
We're just gonna
let that guy get away?

284
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:40,845
Well, we don't know
anything about that guy.

285
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:43,480
He left a crime scene
and he's evading the police.

286
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:44,882
That look like
a good citizen to you?

287
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,168
Look, you were right, okay?

288
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:49,369
Leaving the truck
was a really bad idea.

289
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:52,972
Hey, boys.

290
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,475
Anyone see this thing happen?

291
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:59,011
<i>Come on, who was here</i>
<i>when the gunshots started?</i>

292
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:05,250
Hey, Dylan.

293
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:06,652
You remember me?

294
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,487
Uh, yeah.
Last year, from practice.

295
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:11,290
Yeah, I'm thinking about helping
coach out again this year too.

296
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:13,659
Officer asked you a question.

297
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,294
Ah, we didn't see anything,
Sarge.

298
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:19,297
Well, if you think of anything,

299
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:21,031
call it into the station, okay?

300
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,403
This is not the best place
to be hanging around, guys.

301
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:34,010
They're good kids.

302
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:36,179
I don't blame them
for not wanting to talk.

303
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,847
My guys at division tell me
this is a stash house

304
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:39,316
for Christopher Gearing.

305
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:40,317
Drug trafficker?

306
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:41,551
Meth, mostly.

307
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,753
Not the kind of guy
you wanna snitch on.

308
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:47,923
<i>You know him?</i>

309
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,260
Ted Salansky.

310
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:58,133
Look, I uh...
I have to call his family.

311
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,502
I'll be inside, Matt.

312
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:08,175
Look, we weren't supposed
to be there in the first place,

313
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,344
so let's just leave it at that.

314
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,045
What if it's evidence?

315
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:13,848
What if it's hockey gear?

316
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:15,283
Look, for all we know,

317
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:16,384
they're already
on top of the guy.

318
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,653
So let's just...
keep listening.

319
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:19,786
Okay.

320
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:21,955
We should wait inside though.

321
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,863
Ed! Boss!

322
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:32,932
It's methamphetamine
and money...

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,768
- Who burns money?
- Destroying evidence?

324
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:36,602
They didn't know
the cops were coming.

325
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,604
I found this ski mask.

326
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,172
These guys aren't bank robbers,
they're dealers.

327
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,541
Okay, officer,
you need to tell us exactly

328
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,176
what's going on here.

329
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,779
A little off-the-books
police work?

330
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,414
I wanna speak to my union rep.

331
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,848
I'll tell you what,
we'll get SIU down here.

332
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,116
You can talk to them.

333
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,217
No, sir,
we're not done.

334
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,420
Boss, you need to see these.

335
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,424
Jake, looks like
they know you here, buddy.

336
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,726
Hey, who's this?

337
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,930
The third member of the crew?

338
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,231
The silence isn't
helping, Jake.

339
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,632
Gearing's men are onto you.

340
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,600
We can take care
of ourselves.

341
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,368
Can she?

342
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:14,070
Oh my God.

343
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:15,372
Talk to us.

344
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,709
It wasn't supposed to go
like this.

345
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,411
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

346
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:21,545
Go on, Jake.

347
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,982
Third guy in the crew,
his name is Cam Weyler.

348
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,918
That's his wife Marcy.

349
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,990
Winnie, get me
Staff Sergeant McGrath.

350
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,292
<i>Copy that.</i>

351
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,561
Boss, there is only
one reason why they'd

352
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,595
- have a picture of the wife here.
- I know.

353
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:42,230
What do you got, Greg?

354
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:43,732
<i>Still sifting through this,</i>
<i>Matt,</i>

355
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,066
but we've got reason to think
Gearing might retaliate

356
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,802
against the officers
involved here.

357
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:48,002
How can you tell?

358
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,170
<i>Surveillance photos.</i>

359
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:50,372
They've been tracking
the officers

360
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,974
and one of their wives -
Marcy Weyler.

361
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,275
<i>I mean, does that fit</i>
<i>in Gearing's MO...</i>

362
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:56,444
<i>A hit against a cop's wife?</i>

363
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:58,846
He-he's got no rules.
No code.

364
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,247
<i>That's how he rose to power;</i>

365
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:01,949
<i>by being more brutal</i>
<i>than the competition.</i>

366
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:05,052
Look, Greg...

367
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,388
Greg,
Gearing's got eyes everywhere.

368
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:08,989
<i>By now, he knows you busted up</i>
<i>his stash house.</i>

369
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:10,358
Yeah, and found his plan
to retaliate.

370
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:11,658
Eddie,
if he's gonna strike back,

371
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,159
he's gonna do it now.

372
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:15,495
Let me call division.
You get eyes on Cam, okay?

373
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,865
Okay, team, all hands on deck.

374
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,534
Winnie, we need to find
Marcy Weyler.

375
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:23,436
Let's get unis to her home
and to her work.

376
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:24,838
Copy.

377
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:26,573
Jules, stay here.
Don't take your eyes off him.

378
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,840
Just keep on Jake, Jules.

379
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:29,207
If there's a vigilante plot,

380
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,976
we need to get on top
of those involved,

381
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:32,411
how long -
all of it.

382
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,512
Copy.

383
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,283
Okay, guys,
I'm cutting you loose.

384
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:40,452
Taxi'll take you.

385
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:43,321
So it was cops
that started all this?

386
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,856
What?

387
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:46,657
We were just listengg
on the headsets.

388
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,926
We wanted to know
what was going on?

389
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:50,495
Some officers crossed a line,
Dean.

390
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,196
We'll talk about it later.

391
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:53,731
Are they in trouble?

392
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,965
It doesn't look good, son.
Get in.

393
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,001
517 Belmont.
Thank you.

394
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:00,103
Okay, team,
officers wife is targeted.

395
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,006
Let's find her
and keep her safe!

396
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:42,544
You ready?

397
00:18:58,725 --> 00:18:59,958
<i>Team One, we've got unis</i>

398
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,025
<i>at Marcy Weyler's</i>
<i>home and work,</i>

399
00:19:01,093 --> 00:19:02,494
<i>but she's not there.</i>

400
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:03,829
Okay, Winnie,
just keep digging...

401
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,596
friends, neighbours -
this woman's in danger.

402
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:07,030
We need to find her now.

403
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:08,366
<i>Okay, I got something.</i>

404
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,200
Surveillance photos were taken
at home, at work,

405
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:11,769
and at a third location,

406
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:14,037
and the building's got
a distinctive facade.

407
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:15,272
You recognize it?

408
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,207
Nope. But someone
somewhere does.

409
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:19,042
Reverse image search engine...

410
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,978
<i>It takes a photo</i>
<i>and compares it</i>

411
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:22,345
<i>to every picture on the web.</i>

412
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:25,948
Looks for similar shapes,
colours, patterns.

413
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,216
<i>Barrington Community Center.</i>

414
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:28,317
North end of the neighbourhood.

415
00:19:28,386 --> 00:19:29,853
Guys, let's move.

416
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,754
Staff, ride with me,
I'll fill in.

417
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,054
Perfect.

418
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:33,423
Winnie, call ahead.
Anyone sees Marcy,

419
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:35,324
<i>lock her up in a back room.</i>

420
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:36,426
Copy that.

421
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:47,835
I can't do it, Clark.

422
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:49,304
Dean, what are you doing?

423
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:50,838
We can't just drive off.
It's not right.

424
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:51,839
We're supposed to go home.

425
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,141
It's not right!

426
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,175
Like, Clark,
people could get hurt.

427
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,543
It's not our business, okay?

428
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,844
<i>In or out, boys?</i>
<i>I gotta go.</i>

429
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:59,180
Just hold on a sec,
please.

430
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,882
Okay, tell you what.
Why don't we call 911?

431
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,418
- Anonymous tip.
- No, can't do it.

432
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:05,585
We're dealing
with corrupt cops;

433
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:08,789
we don't know who we can trust.

434
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,224
Look, if you don't want
to do this,

435
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,725
I'll understand.

436
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,060
I'll just tell them
I got out of the truck alone.

437
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,263
- Really? You'd do that?
- Yeah.

438
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:19,598
Making me the biggest dink
on earth. Yeah.

439
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,301
Thanks.
We're good.

440
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,904
Okay, here's what we do.

441
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:26,406
We go back and we check
what's in the duffel bag

442
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:28,808
before we make
any decisions, okay?

443
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,609
And if it's not important,

444
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:31,744
then we can forget all of this.

445
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:33,412
We can just walk away.

446
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,247
And if it is important?

447
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:37,950
Then we tell our dads.

448
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:39,517
And I prepare for life
in the toolshed,

449
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:42,421
where I'll be locked
until I'm eighteen.

450
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,323
All right, let me know
if anything changes.

451
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,591
Cam's not on duty
and he's not answering his cell.

452
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:47,592
APB's gone out.

453
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,927
We'll find him, Matt.

454
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:51,895
He's my officer, Greg.
They all are.

455
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:54,065
I just can't believe
they went rogue.

456
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:55,967
We don't know the whole story.

457
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:57,301
It's this neighbourhood.

458
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:58,735
Tie you up in knots.

459
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:00,571
You remember what it was like,
5, 10 years ago...

460
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,940
Overrun by gangs,
drugs, poverty.

461
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,608
I had my share of calls here.

462
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:07,510
It's changing, Greg,
it really is.

463
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:08,611
You can feel it on the street.

464
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,380
People are fighting back.

465
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:13,649
School enrollment's up,
crime's down.

466
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:15,685
I mean, it's fragile,
you know, it's new,

467
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:18,355
but it's there.

468
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:19,990
<i>Boss, no answer</i>
<i>at the community centre.</i>

469
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:21,357
I'm trying
neighboring businesses.

470
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:22,824
Okay, keep at it, Winnie.

471
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:25,727
This animal, Gearing,
he gets his way,

472
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:28,964
this whole place will slide back
into the dark.

473
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:49,583
So you're really into
this cop stuff, huh?

474
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:54,121
Let me ask you something.
Why?

475
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,891
I wanna help people.

476
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,192
Like your dad.

477
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:02,462
Well...
Not if he can help it.

478
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,963
He's against it?

479
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,966
He doesn't think
I've thought it through.

480
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,068
Right. He knows what you want
better than you do.

481
00:22:08,136 --> 00:22:09,301
You know what it's like

482
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,137
to have the city's top
crisis negotiator

483
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,538
as your father?

484
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:14,440
It sucks.

485
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:17,076
Yeah, well, at least he talks.

486
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:18,677
These days,
my dad hardly says a word.

487
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,447
<i>So you break in,</i>

488
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:24,650
you destroy drugs and money,
and then you leave.

489
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:27,018
That makes sense.

490
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:30,388
You wanna disrupt business,
stop the flow.

491
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:31,722
What about weapons?

492
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,824
What do you do
when you find weapons?

493
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:36,827
I'm just gonna keep
asking you questions, Jake.

494
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:38,129
You're doing your job,
I get it.

495
00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:40,198
And you're just looking out
for your brothers,

496
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:41,665
but the more information
we have,

497
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,934
the more we can help them -
you know this.

498
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,035
I've told you
what you need to know.

499
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:46,370
You still haven't told me why.

500
00:22:46,438 --> 00:22:48,105
Why?

501
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:49,839
You wanna know why, SRU?

502
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:51,341
Because you blow into
the neighbourhood every 6 months

503
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,210
and you make a big show.

504
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:54,311
We live here.

505
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:03,086
Honey,

506
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:04,087
we gotta go.

507
00:23:04,154 --> 00:23:05,688
What?
What's wrong?

508
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:08,057
I'll explain later, come on.

509
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,396
Just be quick
and I'll meet you out here.

510
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:15,497
Okay.

511
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:30,411
Leah, you're with me.
Spike, Sam, north side!

512
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,985
Nooooooo!

513
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:39,820
No! No!

514
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:42,423
Marcy!

515
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:46,892
Noooo!

516
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:48,894
Boss?

517
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,149
Winnie, EMS,
women's change room, right away!

518
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:11,716
<i>Copy.</i>

Sergeant, he killed her...

520
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,321
Baby...

521
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,501
Move!

522
00:24:37,975 --> 00:24:39,075
Stop! Police!

523
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:41,211

00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:57,859
Oof!

530
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:59,094
Get up! Get up!

531
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,533
How old are you?!

532
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:10,471
Dean...
You sure about this?

533
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:11,906
Clark, we agreed.

534
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:13,774
That's not what I mean.

535
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:15,610
It's just...
The guy with the bag,

536
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:16,611
what if he's one of the cops?

537
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,012
Yeah. So?

538
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,514
So they busted up a drug house.

539
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:20,682
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

540
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:22,349
There's a right way
and a wrong way.

541
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:23,517
You have to obey the law.

542
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:25,118
Yeah, the law...

543
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:29,723
What is it?

544
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:38,464
My dad shot a teenage girl,
did you know that?

545
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:40,065
Yeah, she was protecting
her mother,

546
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,034
trying to stop a violent man.

547
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:43,669
She didn't deserve to die.

548
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:44,937
No...

549
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:47,306
Everyone knew it, Dean -
he knew it...

550
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:49,675
But he followed the law...

551
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:50,843
Did he tell you that?

552
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,445
Of course not.

553
00:25:52,512 --> 00:25:53,545
Mom did.

554
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:56,581
She had to say something.

555
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:58,650
Something to explain...

556
00:25:58,718 --> 00:26:01,686
The mood swings,
the silence.

557
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:03,087
I mean, sometimes
you'll just find him

558
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:04,289
and he's in the middle
of something...

559
00:26:04,357 --> 00:26:07,492
just getting a glass out
of the cupboard...

560
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,426
You know, it's just like
someone pressed pause.

561
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:12,363
He's just dead still,
staring at the countertop.

562
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,398
And worst part is,
when I look at him now,

563
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:16,032
that's all I see.

564
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:18,369
The guy who had to do that,

565
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:21,538
the guy who put a bullet
in that girl's head.

566
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:25,642
I mean, what kind of guy
even does that, Dean?

567
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:29,145
Oh gee...

568
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,481
Get down...

569
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:36,286
We're good.

570
00:26:37,254 --> 00:26:38,688
We're good.

571
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:46,495
Wanna go get the bag?

572
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:47,596
Yeah.

573
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,832
Let's go.

574
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:06,480
<i>How is she?</i>

575
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:08,449
Cam?

576
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:09,750
I've got two unis on him.

577
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:11,619
Something's not right, Eddie.

578
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,987
How did Cam know his wife
was being targeted?

579
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:15,388
<i>Good question.</i>

580
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:17,024
He took off before
he even discovered the photos.

581
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,258
And that's before
there was any indication

582
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:19,960
that Gearing was after Marcy.

583
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:21,295
And yet he came directly
to the community center

584
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:22,296
to protect his wife.

585
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,664
So who told him?

586
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:25,765
Well, it wasn't Jake.

587
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:28,501
He's been with me
the whole time.

588
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:55,460
<i>Well, it's not hockey gear.</i>

589
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:01,333
<i>Serial number's are filed off.</i>

590
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,367
These belong
to the drug dealers.

591
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:04,668
Boss, there's only
one other person

592
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,505
who knew that Gearing
was after Marcy.

593
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:09,639
Yeah.

594
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,178
Anyone have eyes
on Matt McGrath?

595
00:28:14,246 --> 00:28:15,445
- No, boss.
- Negative.

596
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:18,381
Hey!

597
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:22,852
I'm gonna need that bag.

598
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:29,335
Winnie, put an APB on
Staff Sergeant Matt McGrath...

599
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:30,970
<i>The whole city -</i>
<i>and top priority.</i>

600
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,371
<i>Copy that.</i>

601
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:36,341
I'm a police officer.
That's official evidence.

602
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:38,110
Hang on...

603
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:41,080
Son, this is a serious matter.
I'm not gonna ask again.

604
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,182
Can I see your badge?

605
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:46,284
You're smart.

606
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:50,621
Now, did you, uh,
know what's in the bag?

607
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:54,425
Yeah.

608
00:28:54,492 --> 00:28:56,493
<i>So you understand</i>
<i>this is a dangerous situation?</i>

609
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:57,595
I'll tell you what.

610
00:28:57,662 --> 00:28:59,163
There's some cops
just over there.

611
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:00,497
How about we take it over
together.

612
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:01,265
I tell you what,

613
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,533
give me that bag

614
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:05,235
and I won't arrest both of you
here and now.

615
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:07,838
I don't believe
I caught your name, officer.

616
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:08,839
Hey! Hey! Stop!

617
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:09,706
Just take it! Take it!
Take it!

618
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:10,874
Just take it!

619
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:16,479
That guy's not right.

620
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,048
Yeah, I know.

621
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:19,216
Yeah, we just let him walk off
with a bag of guns.

622
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:20,751
No, I didn't.

623
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:23,720
No, I put my cell phone
in the bag.

624
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:29,024
Boss, I got Dean on the line.
He says it's urgent.

625
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:30,126
All right, put
him through, Winnie.

626
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,394
<i>Dad...</i>

627
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:32,128
We're in the middle
of a call here, son.

628
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:33,296
Are you all right?

629
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:34,364
Yeah, we're fine.

630
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:35,765
Dean, is Clark with you?

631
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:37,199
Yeah, we're both fine.
It's just...

632
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:38,767
We have some information
about the shooting this morning.

633
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,201
What about it?

634
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,436
We saw a guy running away
from the apartment

635
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,671
and we saw him stash a bag
in the alley

636
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,838
<i>after you guys went in.</i>

637
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,407
You saw all this
from the truck?

638
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:48,343
Uh, no. See, that's the thing.

639
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,478
We got outta the truck.

640
00:29:49,545 --> 00:29:50,412
We wanted to see
what was going on.

641
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,247
You did what?

642
00:29:52,315 --> 00:29:53,248
I specifically told you
to stay inside that truck.

643
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:54,482
Okay, just listen

644
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:55,883
and then you can freak out,
okay?

645
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,050
Clark put you up to this?

646
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:58,018
<i>We both did it.</i>

647
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:00,187
Just please let me explain.

648
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:01,756
<i>We came back to see</i>
<i>if the bag was important</i>

649
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:03,391
and that's when we found out
it was full of...

650
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,359
well, it's full of guns.

651
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:07,060
Guns?

652
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:07,961
<i>With their serial numbers</i>
<i>filed off.</i>

653
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:09,263
Gotta be from Gearing's crew.

654
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:10,430
<i>Cam must be the guy they saw</i>

655
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,032
pulling the guns out
during the raid.

656
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,767
Okay, Dean,
you do not touch those guns,

657
00:30:13,835 --> 00:30:15,169
you understand?

658
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:16,569
That's the thing,
we don't have them anymore.

659
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:17,537
A cop came and took them.

660
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:19,239
What cop?

661
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:20,207
<i>Didn't get his name</i>
<i>off his badge.</i>

662
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:21,708
He's about 6'1", brown hair,

663
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:24,178
gray suit, white shirt.
About 50 years old.

664
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:25,912
That's Matt.

665
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:27,646
Only one reason you'd need
a bag of untraceable guns.

666
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:28,781
He's going after Gearing.

667
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,216
<i>Uh, dad...</i>

668
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:30,983
Winnie, put out an APB
on Gearing,

669
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:32,018
all known locations.

670
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:33,385
Dad...

671
00:30:33,453 --> 00:30:34,653
<i>Associates, friends, family.</i>

672
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,055
He's in grave danger.
We need to bring him in.

673
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:38,090
<i>- Copy.</i>
<i>- Dad, can you listen to me?</i>

674
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:39,458
Oh, son,
I've been listening to you.

675
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:42,060
you disobeyed me;

676
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:43,728
<i>you moved into</i>
<i>a live battle zone;</i>

677
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:46,564
<i>you withheld key information</i>
<i>during an active investigation,</i>

678
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:48,033
<i>and then you exposed yourself</i>
<i>further to danger</i>

679
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,968
by returning to the scene
of the crime.

680
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:51,502
Have I missed anything?!

681
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,405
Yeah, we put a cell phone
in the bag.

682
00:30:54,473 --> 00:30:55,673
You what?

683
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:56,741
<i>We didn't trust the cop,</i>

684
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:58,142
so Clark planted his cell
on him

685
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,410
<i>so you could track it.</i>

686
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:01,511
I'm on it!

687
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:04,215
Dad?

688
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,983
Do not think
you're off the hook.

689
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:07,384
<i>I want you and Clark</i>
<i>to stay where you are.</i>

690
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:09,053
We're sending Jules to you.

691
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,487
<i>Okay.</i>

692
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:12,156
<i>Do not move!</i>
<i>Are we clear?</i>

693
00:31:12,224 --> 00:31:13,523
Yeah.

694
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:14,757
<i>I'll be right there, boss.</i>

695
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:17,293
<i>I just need a sec</i>
<i>with Jake first.</i>

696
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,897
Piece of cake.

697
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:27,737
Marcy's dead.

698
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,508
I know.
I'm sorry, Jake.

699
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,411
<i>Listen, we're gonna need</i>
<i>your help.</i>

700
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,413
Matt's missing.

701
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,581
What?

702
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,115
When he saw Marcy shot,
he took off.

703
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:43,285
We think he went after Gearing.

704
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:44,520
Now, listen,

705
00:31:44,588 --> 00:31:45,954
I can either hand you over
to SIU,

706
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:47,154
or you can come with me

707
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:48,823
and you can help us
stop your sergeant

708
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:52,794
from doing something
he might regret forever.

709
00:31:52,862 --> 00:31:55,162
It's up to you, Jake.

710
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,433
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

711
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,138
<i>Got him.</i>

712
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:07,374
<i>He's moving east on Lakeshore.</i>

713
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:08,475
Right behind you, Spike.

714
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:11,945
<i>He's continuing on Lakeshore.</i>

715
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:16,283
Make a right on Jarvis.

716
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,184
Jules, does that ring any bells
with Jake?

717
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:19,752
<i>Distillery district.</i>

718
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,421
Gearing have any ties there?

719
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:22,922
Koolhaus Night Club.

720
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:24,924
It's part of his
laundering operation.

721
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:26,091
Did you guys get that?

722
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,927
Yeah. We copy, Jules.

723
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:29,161
<i>This is crazy...</i>

724
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:30,530
When I joined the force,

725
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,799
Matt was everything
I wanted to be in a cop.

726
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:34,300
Tell me about that.

727
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,401
He was smart, brave.

728
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:38,837
He cared about the work,

729
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:40,238
<i>cared about the people.</i>

730
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,240
So what happened?

731
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:43,842
Few years ago,
Gearing and his crew

732
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,376
move into the neighbourhood,

733
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:47,846
start pushing all the other
dealers out.

734
00:32:47,914 --> 00:32:49,380
Full on turf war.

735
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:52,282
Things just blew up on us.

736
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:55,118
One day, out on patrol,

737
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:56,821
shots-fired call comes in.

738
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,823
Middle of the day...

739
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,324
<i>Matt's first on the scene.</i>

740
00:33:00,391 --> 00:33:02,860
<i>Two victims, 10-54.</i>

741
00:33:02,928 --> 00:33:04,227
<i>No need for EMS.</i>

742
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:07,330
<i>First one was fifteen.</i>

743
00:33:08,231 --> 00:33:11,167
<i>The other was twelve -</i>
<i>twelve years old.</i>

744
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:13,336
Just kids.

745
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:15,171
<i>That's how Gearing</i>
<i>won the war;</i>

746
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:17,273
<i>using child soldiers.</i>

747
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:19,241
We're taking him down, Jake.

748
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,243
He's done.

749
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:27,315
<i>After that, Matt put
together a task force.</i>

750
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:28,917
Me, Ted, Cam.

751
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:31,086
We spent months
investigating Gearing.

752
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:33,321
Stakeouts, surveillance,
undercover...

753
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:34,957
<i>we poured everything</i>
<i>that we had into it.</i>

754
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:36,792
Thousands of man hours.

755
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,360
<i>Cracked his distribution</i>
<i>chains,</i>

756
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:40,928
<i>infiltrated</i>
<i>his laundering operation,</i>

757
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:43,598
and the day we arrested him...

758
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:47,034
that was my proudest moment
on the force.

759
00:33:47,102 --> 00:33:48,135
<i>When the case went to court,</i>

760
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:50,204
the whole thing
just fell apart.

761
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,074
<i>Half our evidence got</i>
<i>thrown out on technicalities.</i>

762
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,543
<i>Some witnesses recanted,</i>

763
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:58,411
<i>others didn't even show up</i>
<i>at all.</i>

764
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,345
<i>Gearing made</i>
<i>our whole task force</i>

765
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,914
<i>look like a joke.</i>

766
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:02,516
<i>The only thing that stuck</i>

767
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,584
<i>was an unlicensed</i>
<i>weapon charge.</i>

768
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:06,953
Six months probation.

769
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:09,222
<i>So you changed tactics.</i>

770
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:11,657
<i>Matt formed a new task force -</i>
<i>off the books.</i>

771
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:13,458
If we couldn't get him
in the courts,

772
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:15,995
we were gonna get him
in the streets.

773
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:17,830
<i>Whenever we heard</i>
<i>of a stash house,</i>

774
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:18,731
we wouldn't wait
for a warrant...

775
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:20,533
We'd crush it.

776
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,068
<i>We take their guns,</i>
<i>we destroy their product.</i>

777
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:24,637
<i>Zero tolerance.</i>

778
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:26,338
And it was working.

779
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,842
<i>Did you ever use violence?</i>

780
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,610
We thought about it...

781
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:35,813
about cutting the head off
the snake,

782
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:37,916
ending it once and for all,

783
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:40,785
but Matt said no.

784
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,055
Greg, he's a good man.

785
00:34:45,122 --> 00:34:46,957
We gotta get there
and we gotta stop this.

786
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:25,894
Keep quiet,
you might survive this.

787
00:35:53,794 --> 00:35:54,828
Gearing!

788
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:57,931
Am I under arrest?

789
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,767
I should've done this
years ago...

790
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,505
Dylan...

791
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:08,908
<i>Right there! Right there!</i>

792
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,276
The signals coming
from the parking lot.

793
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:13,579
Son, listen to me...

794
00:36:13,647 --> 00:36:15,314
What're you waiting for?

795
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,582
You're not gonna do this.

796
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,817
I know you...

797
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,755
I know you...

798
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:30,162
Aghhh!

799
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:43,874
Dylan, you okay?

800
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:46,177
<i>Stay there!</i>

801
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:49,145
Boss, Spike, with me.

802
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:50,746
Sam, Leah, main floor.
Let's move now!

803
00:36:54,017 --> 00:36:55,185
We've got a couple
of kids here.

804
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:56,319
They're tied up.
We'll come back for them.

805
00:36:56,387 --> 00:36:57,420
Let's move!

806
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:03,560
Greg...

807
00:37:04,428 --> 00:37:06,395
You all right, son?
You okay?

808
00:37:07,797 --> 00:37:09,398
Hey, it's Dylan, right?

809
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:10,365
All right, you hang tough.

810
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,366
I couldn't do it.

811
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:12,601
Couldn't do what, son?

812
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:15,270
The sergeant...
I didn't shoot him.

813
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:16,838
I... I couldn't do it.

814
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:22,110
Stay here.

815
00:37:39,494 --> 00:37:40,627
Agh!

816
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:51,838
Agh!

817
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:57,109
Up on your knees!

818
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,384
Sergeant, right there!
Put the gun down!

819
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,785
Put it down now!

820
00:38:06,853 --> 00:38:09,154
We've got the subject
on the lower level.

821
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,588
Put it down now!

822
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,191
Sir...

823
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:14,892
Clark, what you said earlier,

824
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,994
<i>about your dad</i>
<i>killing that girl...</i>

825
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,930
He had to do it.
It was the right thing.

826
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,366
Yeah?

827
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,201
When we were in the Lane,
talking to that sergeant,

828
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:25,402
<i>he was messed up,</i>
<i>you could see it.</i>

829
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,637
He was just so lost.

830
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,440
That's why your dad
followed the law;

831
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,609
he knows what happens
when you don't.

832
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,977
He knows what you become.

833
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,012
He is so torn up, Dean.

834
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,116
What your dad had to do
was terrible,

835
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,485
but he made the right call.

836
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:46,021
What're you doing, Matt?

837
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:48,257
Walk away, Greg.
Let me do this.

838
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:50,025
I can't.

839
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:52,961
No one's gonna miss him.
No one's gonna mourn him.

840
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:54,363
<i>I know...</i>

841
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:56,031
He puts guns in the hands
of children...

842
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,432
and sends them out to kill

843
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,766
<i>other children, women...</i>

844
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:00,034
I know that.

845
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:02,170
And we play by the rules,

846
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:04,306
we fight fair...
Why?

847
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:05,707
Huh, Greg?

848
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:08,042
Why does this monster
deserve your protection?

849
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,645
Do I need to answer that?

850
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:12,113
<i>We're not here</i>
<i>to protect him, Matt.</i>

851
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:14,381
We're here to protect you.

852
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:18,419
No.

853
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:20,487
Well, I tried being
a good cop...

854
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:21,855
doesn't make any difference.

855
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:24,091
Doesn't make a difference?

856
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:25,626
Excuse me?!

857
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:27,794
The kid upstairs says otherwise.

858
00:39:27,862 --> 00:39:30,463
Dylan was supposed to kill you,
but he didn't.

859
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:31,331
<i>Because when it came</i>
<i>down to it,</i>

860
00:39:31,398 --> 00:39:32,932
he knows good from bad.

861
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,468
And you know how?

862
00:39:35,536 --> 00:39:38,003
Because you took the time
to get to know him.

863
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:39,706
You took the time
to be a part of his world.

864
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:41,407
You did what a good cop does.

865
00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:43,343
You cared...
you care.

866
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:49,214
He knows the difference
between you and this murderer.

867
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:51,483
You gonna prove him wrong?

868
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:06,897
<i>Don't prove him wrong,</i>
<i>come on...</i>

869
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:08,899
<i>Come on.</i>

870
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:13,904
Let it go.

878

You know, what Clark did
with the cell phone...

879
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:24,203
we wouldn't have come in time.

880
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,238
It's a pretty smart move.
It's pretty brave.

881
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:28,006
And what, that makes up for it?

882
00:41:28,074 --> 00:41:29,842
No. Sometimes Dean
drives me crazy,

883
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:31,444
won't listen to a word I say,

884
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:32,411
and other times
he does something

885
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:33,746
that makes me so proud
