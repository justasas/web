1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,670
Where is Michelle Dalton?!

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,706
Michelle!!!

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:11,142
Team One, James is headed
to the banquet kitchen.

4
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:12,743
- Come on, let's go.
- Excuse me.

5
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,845
Where is she?!

6
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:18,081
Wh-what's he doing?

7
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:19,149
Ed?

8
00:00:19,216 --> 00:00:20,317
<i>Seconds away.</i>

9
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:22,385
Michelle?!!

10
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:24,054
James?

11
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:28,524
Mom...

12
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:35,030
_

13
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:37,866
We carry machine guns;

14
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:41,170
nine millimeters, cornershots.

15
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:42,871
<i>And we are trained</i>
<i>to fire those guns...</i>

16
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:48,077
And then we are trained
not to fire them.

17
00:00:48,144 --> 00:00:50,244
Now, this job isn't
about firing guns,

18
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:53,514
this job is about getting
into the subject's head.

19
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:57,685
<i>It's about listening</i>
<i>to what they have to say.</i>

20
00:00:57,752 --> 00:00:59,787
I'm gonna holster my gun...

21
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:01,122
<i>You gotta connect...</i>

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,224
Respect and protect.

23
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,725
Keep the peace.

24
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:06,093
That's right.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,094
Okay.

26
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:08,428
You guys,

27
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:10,697
who here has thought about
being a cop?

28
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:12,899
Good. Good, good.

29
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:15,702
My son, Clark,
he's got other plans;

30
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:17,037
I can respect that.

31
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:19,339
<i>Anybody else?</i>

32
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,912
<i>Now, in my case,</i>
<i>my dad was a cop,</i>

33
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,381
<i>my brother's a cop,</i>

34
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:30,383
<i>and I started out</i>
<i>walking the beat.</i>

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,918
And it was actually
this guy's dad

36
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:35,154
who convinced me
to join this new unit--

37
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:36,355
the SRU.

38
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,691
<i>Wasn't easy--</i>
<i>not for any of us.</i>

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,360
<i>Hundreds apply, few make it in.</i>

40
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:44,029
<i>First you take a psych test,</i>

41
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:45,797
<i>multiple choice--</i>

42
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:47,098
<i>what kind of cop are you?</i>
<i>What kind of human being? -</i>

43
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,967
1600 questions.

44
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:50,268
And you get through that,

45
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,871
<i>then it's fitness tests</i>
<i>and drills.</i>

46
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,706
<i>We specialize</i>
<i>in marksmanship...</i>

47
00:01:57,475 --> 00:02:00,845
<i>Bombs, tech, psychology,</i>
<i>negotiations.</i>

48
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,747
<i>Every day, you push yourself</i>
<i>to your limit...</i>

49
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:03,948
Go! Go! Go! Go!

50
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,083
<i>Physically, mentally...</i>

51
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:09,486
<i>So that you can handle the job</i>
<i>when the job gets tough.</i>

52
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:19,128
<i>Because the job does get tough.</i>

53
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,496
<i>But you work hard,</i>

54
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:21,831
you do your best.

55
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:24,768
<i>You do what you think is right</i>

56
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:28,537
and you'll find peace
in whatever you choose to do.

57
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:32,675
Aghhh!

58
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:41,916
Watch the corner.

59
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:43,918
We're almost there.

60
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:46,320
<i>We are getting way too good</i>
<i>at this.</i>

61
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:47,354
Seriously.

62
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,793
Oh my God.
Okay.

63
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,061
<i>So I'll tell you
what I'm thinking.</i>

64
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:55,229
After work,
I'll buy a bottle of bubbly,

65
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:57,331
bring it back here,
and we'll crack it open

66
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,498
and celebrate
your show tonight.

67
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,666
Just the two of us.

68
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,167
Well, maybe not the first time.

69
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:03,737
Second maybe?
I could suck.

70
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,572
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,709
You are May Dalton.

72
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,911
You're smart, talented.

73
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,513
Wise beyond your years,

74
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:15,748
and you are the bravest person

75
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,116
that I have ever known.

76
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,354
And who do you think
I got all that from?

77
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:26,425
I gotta go. Bye.

78
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:30,061
Hey.

79
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,562
<i>Hey, goddess.</i>

80
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,431
Shouldn't you be working?

81
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,001
I've got eleven posters left,

82
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,736
and I do not plan on
letting them go to waste.

83
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,170
Tobias, you're already late,

84
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:40,271
and your boss is gonna--

85
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:41,439
It's whatever.

86
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:43,842
You're worth it.

87
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:47,144
You know, it's killing me
that you can't be there tonight.

88
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:49,680
So sing for me now.

89
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:50,981
What?

90
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,382
<i>- Please?</i>
<i>- I can't just--</i>

91
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,051
<i>Just sing it</i>
<i>like you're up there</i>

92
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,820
and I'm the only one
watching you.

93
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,391
Okay, just hang on a second.

94
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:09,231

95
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,002

99
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,714
Hang on.
Call waiting.

100
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,086
It's him.
Not taking it.

101
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:34,722
Uh, that's good.
That's good, that's good.

102
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,792
You know what? I'm gonna um...
I'm gonna come see you.

103
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:39,593
I need my good luck kiss.

104
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,864
<i>Hi, this is
may, leave a message.</i>

105
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:45,232
Hey... it's me.

106
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:50,837
Um... I just I wanted to call

107
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:52,471
and give you
this cell phone number.

108
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,808
I had to get a new cell phone
because the phone company's...

109
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:58,945
All right, I just...

110
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:01,547
I just want you to know
that I'm thinking about you

111
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,216
and...

112
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,251
and happy birthday.

113
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,421
And uh...

114
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:15,027
I would really like
to hear your voice, okay?

115
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:17,462
Dammit!

116
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:20,799
The couple moving in's
been more than patient.

117
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,466
I told you, I can pay.

118
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:23,835
You were supposed to be out
a week ago--

119
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:25,002
Look, the new job,
it's as good as mine--

120
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,503
No way.

121
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:27,638
Two weeks-- first paycheck,
it's all yours. Come on--

122
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:29,173
I've heard it before.

123
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,110
Okay, look, take my watch.

124
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,144
It's worth $300 bucks,
all right?

125
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:34,078
I don't want
your damn watch--

126
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,713
$300 bucks, all right?

127
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:37,148
You can have the ring as well.
It's white gold, all right?

128
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:38,915
I sure as hell don't need it
anymore. Take it.

129
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:40,450
James...

130
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:41,517
Come on.

131
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:44,587
All right, look...

132
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:46,589
Here. Take this.

133
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:48,024
It's real crystal.

134
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:49,325
It's real.

135
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:50,193
You gotta be able
to get something for this.

136
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,595
Come on, take it.
Take it!

137
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:00,602
You're gone by tonight.

138
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:03,906
Don't make me call the cops.

139
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,709
You will show me some respect!

140
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,965
- How was class, Ed?
- It was good.

141
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,233
Your kid's school, right?

142
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:35,468
Yeah. Boss's kid
goes there too.

143
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,070
Dean seemed pretty into it.

144
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:38,138
Oh, yeah?

145
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:39,406
Well, more than Clark did.

146
00:06:39,473 --> 00:06:40,974
That's because your boy's
had seventeen years

147
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:41,974
living with a cop.

148
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:42,975
Mine's just getting started.

149
00:06:43,043 --> 00:06:44,710
Yeah, we'll see.

150
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,746
<i>What's not to love</i>
<i>about being a cop?</i>

151
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,715
The hours, the glamour,
the girls...

152
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,083
The girls?

153
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:52,384
King Street, Saturday night?

154
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:54,153
I'm just saying, I saw you.

155
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,055
Hey, I was just making sure
the ladies got home safe.

156
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,056
Both ladies.

157
00:06:58,257 --> 00:06:59,191
Raf.

158
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:00,926
Yeah, boss.

159
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:04,162
So, uh, coming up
on a year next week.

160
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,831
Yeah, I know.

161
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:07,966
So how is it goin'?

162
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:09,801
You tell me.

163
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:12,838
I think you're doing great.

164
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:15,039
But it's a two-way relationship,
you and the job.

165
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:16,040
You know what I'm saying?

166
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:17,574
I think so.

167
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,244
After a year,

168
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:22,079
you get a taste of how
the job's doing for you.

169
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:24,915
I hear you, boss.
It's all good.

170
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:26,416
Good. Okay.

171
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:29,986
So two girls, huh?

172
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,354
Actually, it was three,
but who's countin'?

173
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,132
Yo! Tobias!

174
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,601
The new graphics look good.

175
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:46,902
Just finished programming.

176
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,504
Sweet! How's May?
Big night.

177
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:49,705
She's gonna be awesome!

178
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:52,975
Won't be long
till she's playing here.

179
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,377
You know it!

180
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:57,545
Can I help you?

181
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:00,849
Hey, we're not open yet!

182
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,650
I'm here for him.

183
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:06,454
Hey!

184
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:07,922
We need to talk.

185
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,457
- What're you doing here?
- I need some information.

186
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:12,693
I'm not gonna talk to you.

187
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:15,195
Yes, you are gonna talk to me.

188
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:20,601
Winnie, go for the 911...

189
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,003
David?

190
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,304
<i>David,</i>
<i>this is Sergeant Greg Parker,</i>

191
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,473
<i>I'm with the Strategic</i>
<i>Response Unit.</i>

192
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,275
Can you identify the gunman?

193
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,842
No idea.

194
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:32,345
He came in,
went straight for my friend.

195
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,579
<i>Okay. Does he know him?</i>

196
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,916
I don't know.
He's shouting at him--

197
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,017
Tell me where she is!

198
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,751
You gotta get here.

199
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:39,752
Oof!

200
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Oh my God!

201
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,291
What's going on?

202
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,225
I don't want to hurt you!
Tell me where she is!

203
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,927
Come on, David, talk to me.
What's happening?

204
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,663
Tell me now!

205
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,272
Ungh!

206
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,507
Aghhhh!

207
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,648
Eddie...

208
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,152
Get up! Get up!

209
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,153
Get up now!

210
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,454
Start walking!

211
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,555
David! David!

212
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,490
I'm here.

213
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,291
Don't engage him, please!

214
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,694
I just need you to tell me
what he is doing?

215
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:26,797
He's taking him outside.
He's getting away.

216
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:28,766
All right, we're almost there.
You hang tight.

217
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:31,335
I heard another shot!

218
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:33,470
David, stay inside!

219
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:35,472
Sam, take the
entrance on Richardson.

220
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,773
<i>Copy that.</i>

221
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,208
He's getting away,

222
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:40,844
I think he's got Tobias
in the car.

223
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,512
What kind of car is it?

224
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,413
Grey Sedan.
I can't make out the plate.

225
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,015
Ends in a one.
Sixty-one.

226
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,183
Sam, you get that?

227
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,919
Affirmative.
We got him.

228
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:53,221
Only one person in the car.

229
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:01,262
<i>This is
the Strategic Response Unit!</i>

230
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,799
This is the police!
Pull over immediately!

231
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,766
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>pull your vehicle over!</i>

232
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:10,204
We got an image from the
CCTV, it's gone to your phones.

233
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,606
No sign of Tobias.

234
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:12,773
If Tobias took a
blow to the head,

235
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,108
he could have passed out
in the car.

236
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:14,842
You heard three shots, right?

237
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,477
Yeah.

238
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:17,244
So one when you land,
and the second hit here...

239
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,212
And then one outside.

240
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,547
I'll call in forensics,

241
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:21,147
see if they can account
for the third.

242
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,983
We didn't see any impact
or ricochet marks outside.

243
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,485
You think he's been shot?

244
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:26,620
What's going on?

245
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,087
Excuse me, who are you?

246
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:29,222
May Dalton. The cop outside
told me to come in

247
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:30,590
and talk to you.

248
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:32,025
His girlfriend.

249
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:35,595
Where's Tobias?

250
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:38,397
Listen, May, your
boyfriend was taken by somebody.

251
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,966
- What?
- Somebody came in here, took him outside.

252
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,701
He was armed.

253
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:44,537
Okay, May, sit down--

254
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,704
No, I don't need to sit down,

255
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:47,339
I need to know what's going on.

256
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:48,941
We're trying to figure
that out, all right? Spike.

257
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,809
Do you know this man?

258
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:54,612
Oh God...

259
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,281
May, do you know this man?

260
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,183
That's my father!

261
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:05,189
Still in pursuit.
This guy's not slowing down.

262
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,430
<i>Pull over!</i>

263
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:16,033
I repeat,
pull your vehicle over!

264
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:18,401
You see that?

265
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,736
Let's see if we can
force him off Gerrard.

266
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,504
Get up close.

267
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:30,613
Winnie, set up a roadblock
on Jarvis.

268
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:31,714
Sam!

269
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,219
Pull back! Pull back!

270
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:38,353
Oof!

271
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,294
Winnie, we need EMS, right now!

272
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:53,554
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

273
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:23,450
Winnie, give us an APB,

274
00:12:23,517 --> 00:12:24,651
Gerrard heading east
from Ontario.

275
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,185
Where's EMS?

276
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:27,587
Tobias, keep still,
we're gonna take care of you.

277
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:28,755
- You gotta tell May...
- Easy, easy, easy...

278
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:29,789
He's gonna find her, okay?

279
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:31,057
He's gonna find
both of them--

280
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,325
What do you mean?
Both of who?

281
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:33,460
He said he wanted to know
where May was,

282
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:34,927
but I wouldn't tell him,
and then he said

283
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:36,228
he'd ask her mom,
so I told him...

284
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:37,329
Told him what, Tobias?

285
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,130
Royal York Hotel,
where she works.

286
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:42,267
He's going there now.
He's got a gun!

287
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:56,947
I'm calling the hotel.

288
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:58,783
Everything we can
on any James Mitchell

289
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:00,351
- matching his description.
- Copy.

290
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,086
- I need to see Tobias.
- Tobias is gonna be okay,

291
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:03,320
but we gotta get
to your mom and dad

292
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,655
and make sure
they're gonna be okay, too.

293
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,290
You can't let him near my mom.

294
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:07,291
<i>I hear you.</i>

295
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,260
What's your name?

296
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:12,930
It's Ed.
Ed Lane.

297
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:15,799
Ed, you can't let this happen.

298
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,701
You don't know my father.

299
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,336
Can you help us know him, May?

300
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:20,637
May, can you ride with us?

301
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:21,939
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

302
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:27,243
Tobias is with EMS.

303
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,444
We're on our way to the hotel,

304
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:29,745
squad cars en route.

305
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:31,314
Jules, any luck
reaching the mother?

306
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:32,748
She works the banquets,

307
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:33,883
they don't know
if she's showed up to work yet.

308
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:35,684
They're looking for her.

309
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:40,122
So you and your
mom left last year?

310
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,723
Is that right?

311
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,192
It should've been sooner.

312
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,794
What happened?

313
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,897
It wasn't just one thing,
it was everything.

314
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:50,498
Then it just got worse.

315
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,700
Were you afraid of your dad?

316
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:55,002
Yeah.

317
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,239
He thought I didn't know
who he was.

318
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:00,107
I knew who he was.

319
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,976
<i>Your problem is</i>
<i>you just don't think.</i>

320
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:05,145
James, I told
you about it last week.

321
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:06,547
<i>You told me...</i>

322
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:07,915
You said it was okay.

323
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,583
The sheets were only on sale
for the weekend--

324
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:11,652
I said it was okay?

325
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:13,654
You did.

326
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,756
Are you telling me
what I remember now?

327
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:16,690
<i>- No. Please...</i>
<i>- Are you?!</i>

328
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:18,257
<i>No!</i>

329
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,659
Because now I have a
car payment that bounces.

330
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,627
- I'm sorry.
- I have a car payment that bounces

331
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,764
because you need new sheets!

332
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,198
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>From now on,</i>

333
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,834
<i>you sign your cheques</i>
<i>over to me, Michelle.</i>

334
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,234
I give you what you need.

335
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,235
You don't need to do that.

336
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,604
Why not?

337
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,205
You planning on making
a move, Michelle?

338
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,342
- Don't...
- Don't you lie to me!

339
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,409
Dad?

340
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,215
Hey, May-be.

341
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,287
Uh, you finish
your Egyptian project?

342
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:51,956
Yeah...
Yeah, almost.

343
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:56,026
Hey um...
Do me a favour?

344
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,864
Help your mom clean up
the plates she broke.

345
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:02,032
You know how she gets.

346
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,401
Thank you, sweetie.

347
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:19,215
He took away all her money
so she couldn't leave,

348
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:20,517
made her think she was crazy,

349
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:22,885
and that he was the normal one.

350
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:25,654
May, moving out,
the restraining order.

351
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:27,255
<i>Your mom changing her name,</i>

352
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:30,058
<i>those are all things</i>
<i>that both of you did right,</i>

353
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,793
<i>and that past is behind you.</i>

354
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:34,530
But it's not!
I mean, look where I am.

355
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:35,864
I'm in a car with two cops.

356
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,298
I mean, no offense, guys,

357
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:38,633
but you really haven't done
the best job

358
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,401
of keeping him away.

359
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:45,439
<i>He called me today</i>
<i>'cause it's my birthday.</i>

360
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:47,808
How'd he get
my cell phone number?

361
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,144
<i>He even tracked down</i>
<i>where Tobias works.</i>

362
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,712
Now he knows where my mom works.

363
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,080
I mean, what are we supposed
to do?

364
00:15:55,783 --> 00:16:00,587
<i>Tobias has done everything</i>
<i>so that we can feel safe.</i>

365
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:05,759
But I guess that's just
not gonna happen.

366
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:18,437
- Hello.
- Hi.

367
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:19,905
Uh, Heather,

368
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:21,440
I wonder if you can help me,
I'm looking for someone.

369
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:22,942
Of course.
Is this person a guest with us today?

370
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,476
No. An employee.

371
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:25,877
Oh, okay.

372
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,278
You'd need to speak
to the resident manager.

373
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:29,246
- Shall I call him?
- Sure.

374
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:33,952
You know, actually,
I just came in to say hi.

375
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,019
It's the manager
I'm looking for...

376
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,021
I have a job interview.

377
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,255
A friend set it up.

378
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:40,758
I have his name here
somewhere...

379
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,258
Floyd Mather.

380
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:44,194
Mr. Mather.
Right.

381
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,596
<i>Take those stairs</i>
<i>up to the mezzanine,</i>

382
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:48,198
then all the way around
and look for the signs.

383
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:49,566
Thank you so much.

384
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,901
<i>Good luck!</i>

385
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,740
<i>Boss, James served two</i>
<i>30-day sentences last year--</i>

386
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,109
<i>Assault and violating</i>
<i>a restraining order.</i>

387
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,078
<i>Domestic offenses</i>
<i>go back four years,</i>

388
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:03,746
and he's been out of work
for over a year.

389
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,214
There's gonna be money issues.

390
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:06,548
I talked to Tobias.

391
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:07,917
Michelle and May
have moved three times

392
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,051
in the last year

393
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,552
and James keeps finding them,

394
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:12,154
<i>and every time he escalates.</i>

395
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:14,255
Dominating personality,
multiple stressors,

396
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:16,324
his life is out of control.

397
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:21,429
<i>He picks today to lash back</i>
<i>at the one person he can blame.</i>

398
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:23,231
And we know how these things
often go.

399
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:24,599
<i>Yeah, that's what</i>
<i>I'm afraid of.</i>

400
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,667
Murder-suicide.

401
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,711
I'm looking for the manager.

402
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:38,846
Can I help you?

403
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:41,515
Yes.
Where's Michelle Dalton?

404
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:47,319
May, we're gonna do
everything we can

405
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:48,420
to keep your mom safe.

406
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:50,489
This is what we do, May.

407
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:51,958
Nobody needs to get hurt today.

408
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,594
Tell me your name again.

409
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:58,998
Greg Parker.

410
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:00,700
Greg.

411
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,433
Greg and Ed.

412
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:09,041
I wanna be able to hold you

413
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:10,976
to what you just
told to me, okay?

414
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:15,747
Okay, May.

415
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,050
Okay.

416
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:29,426
<i>Let's go!</i>

417
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:30,527
Let's go!

418
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:40,369
Where is Michelle Dalton?!

419
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:43,006
Michelle!

420
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:44,207
Where is she?

421
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,443
Michelle!

422
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:48,544
James...

423
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,263
Is that him?

424
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,597
Yeah.
That's definitely him.

425
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,867
Spike, we got a positive ID
on James.

426
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:09,069
<i>Concierge says he's looking</i>
<i>for the HR manager.</i>

427
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:10,337
Thank you, Heather.

428
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:11,704
Heather, where can I find
the manager?

429
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:12,872
Uh, mezzanine.
Up those stairs.

430
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,307
Thank you.
Spike, transponders on.

431
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:15,407
Let's move.

432
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:21,914
Up the stairs, left and left.

433
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:23,316
May's gonna help us profile.

434
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:24,383
No problem.

435
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,351
May? Spike.
Have a seat.

436
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:27,252
Thanks.

437
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,386
Okay?

438
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:41,199
This wasn't necessary,
Michelle?

439
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,667
You know that none of this
had to happen,

440
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:44,835
don't you?

441
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:48,605
<i>All you had to do</i>
<i>was talk to me.</i>

442
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,908
You know what day it is today.

443
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:59,482
Four, seven, Bravo, Kilo

444
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,651
underscore Tango, X-ray.
Thank you.

445
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,320
Those dots, is that your team?

446
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,222
Yep, and if my mom
was in trouble?

447
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,023
They're the ones I'd wanna see
coming through the window.

448
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,227
That's-that's inside.
How did you...?

449
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,096
It's magic.

450
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,731
Or hotel security
just gave you their access code

451
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,632
and wi-fi password.

452
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,768
She sees right though me.

453
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,637
Sir, the man who attacked you,
where did he go?

454
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:24,171
Michelle Dalton,
he went after her.

455
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,672
She was just in
the banquet kitchen.

456
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,408
- Banquet kitchen?
- The other side of the hotel,

457
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,076
through that door,
two flights down.

458
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,344
Okay, go back to your office.

459
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:31,879
We'll get you help
as soon as we can.

460
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,447
Team one, James is headed
to the banquet kitchen.

461
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:34,982
<i>Copy that.</i>

462
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,884
<i>Boss, you're close.</i>
<i>Down the stairs to your right.</i>

463
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,352
Okay.
Here we go.

464
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,022
He's going to shoot her.

465
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:43,489
No, this is Team One
we're talking about May.

466
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:45,058
I need to hear.
Can we hear?

467
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:46,559
No. You know,
it can get a little bit intense--

468
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:49,095
Spike, I'm not a kid, okay?

469
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:50,496
<i>You said so yourself,</i>
<i>she'll be fine.</i>

470
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:52,933
Now am I here to help
or am I not?

471
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,200
Boss, okay if I patch May
into the conversation?

472
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:57,169
Okay, Spike,
but use your judgment.

473
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:58,370
<i>Copy that.</i>

474
00:20:58,438 --> 00:20:59,405
Okay, I'm gonna put it
on speaker.

475
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:00,306
You're gonna hear
the team's mics

476
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,373
and whatever we can pick up

477
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:03,442
from the kitchen
intercom system.

478
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,278
<i>I've been more than
reasonable with you.</i>

479
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:07,846
This is what happens

480
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:11,582
when you push a reasonable man
for too long!

481
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,619
No problem, James.
It's no problem.

482
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:17,088
<i>Put the gun away</i>

483
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,691
and you and I can have
a reasonable talk, okay?

484
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:22,994
All right.

485
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:27,664
Let's start with this...

486
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:30,968
Where is my daughter?

487
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,604
<i>Where is she?!</i>

488
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:36,206
Let's get the other
civilians out of the kitchen

489
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:37,674
and get him talking.

490
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,509
This man needs
to feel in control.

491
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,878
He's not a fan of
cops telling him what to do.

492
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,545
He doesn't like anyone
telling him what to do.

493
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:44,947
He has to be in charge.

494
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,282
Boss, you copy that?

495
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,450
Yeah, Spike, I heard.

496
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:48,451
Let's clear the room.

497
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:50,186
Yeah.

498
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:51,454
Excuse me.

499
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:52,654
Sir, I need you
to leave right now.

500
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,226
I need you to leave now.

501
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,427
- Come on, let's go.
- Excuse me...

502
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:00,962
<i>Subject's standing twenty
feet from the banquet doors,</i>

503
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,097
facing away.

504
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:06,567
How could you do this to me?!

505
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:07,869
<i>James, I don't know
what you're talking about!</i>

506
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,104
Don't lie to me!

507
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:10,872
I'm not!

508
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:12,073
<i>Don't stand there</i>
<i>and lie to my face!</i>

509
00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:13,408
<i>Don't try to turn this around!</i>

510
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:14,976
<i>You know damn well</i>
<i>this is your fault!</i>

511
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,210
<i>Please put the gun down.</i>

512
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:18,212
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what you want me to say.</i>

513
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,447
<i>I want you to tell me</i>
<i>the truth!</i>

514
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:21,848
James?

515
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,250
My name is Greg Parker.

516
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:26,020
I'd like to talk to you
if that's all right?

517
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,422
This is no one else's business.

518
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,557
I appreciate that,
but what I'd like to do--

519
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,924
Who the hell are you?

520
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:33,226
My name is Greg, like I said,

521
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,361
I'm a professional negotiator.

522
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:36,695
<i>What I'd like to do here</i>

523
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:39,065
<i>is maybe help facilitate</i>
<i>a dialogue.</i>

524
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:42,568
<i>A conversation is</i>
<i>what I am trying to do here!</i>

525
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:45,838
I don't need
a professional negotiator

526
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,841
to have a conversation
with my own ex-wife,

527
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,308
for godsake!

528
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:51,677
<i>All right?</i>

529
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,913
What I need is
a little privacy.

530
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,948
Okay, that's great.
Let's do that.

531
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:57,416
I mean, you're in charge here.

532
00:22:57,483 --> 00:22:58,851
Why don't you just tell
the other people in the room

533
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,253
that it's time for them to go.

534
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:04,422
<i>I just wanna talk to my wife!</i>

535
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:05,990
<i>I hear you, James.</i>

536
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:07,725
Ed, what's your status?

537
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,427
<i>Seconds away.</i>

538
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:12,163
<i>It'd be easier</i>
<i>to have that conversation...</i>

539
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,698
In position.

540
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:14,832
<i>You're calling the shots here.</i>

541
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,934
<i>They'll do whatever you say.</i>

542
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,035
<i>Just ask them to leave.</i>

543
00:23:17,102 --> 00:23:18,703
In position.

544
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:20,370
<i>You want privacy?</i>
<i>That's reasonable.</i>

545
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:21,504
<i>You want them to go?</i>
<i>That's fair.</i>

546
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:22,739
Just tell them.

547
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:27,544
Okay, okay.
Get out of here!

548
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:29,279
Everyone get out!

549
00:23:29,346 --> 00:23:30,681
Except for you.

550
00:23:30,748 --> 00:23:31,782
Get out now!

551
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:34,952
<i>Get out!</i>

552
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,686
Thank you, James,
that's a good choice.

553
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:39,521
I said, get outta here, now!

554
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,957
I'm not going anywhere.

555
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:42,792
You've got something to say,
you can say it now.

556
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,693
No.

557
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,727
What's wrong?

558
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:46,528
Hold it!

559
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,764
You hold it right there!

560
00:23:48,832 --> 00:23:52,634
That's Keith;
that's my mother's boyfriend.

561
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,336
You're him, aren't you?

562
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,906
- James.
- He is, isn't he?

563
00:23:57,974 --> 00:23:59,908
You're the workplace boyfriend.

564
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:01,542
Oh boy...

565
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:05,513
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>How is it?</i>

566
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:07,015
<i>W-w-what're you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

567
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,115
My ex-wife.

568
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:11,251
How is it?

569
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:14,488
It's my fault.

570
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,690
Last time I talked to him,
I was just trying to help.

571
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:18,225
You mentioned your mother
was seeing someone?

572
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,661
I just said we have to stop
dwelling on the past,

573
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,195
on grudges,
and we have to move on...

574
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:23,196
and then I mentioned Keith.

575
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:24,463
Oh my God!

576
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,065
May! You didn't make
this happen.

577
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,266
Hey, James, why don't we just
stay on track--

578
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:28,968
I am talking here!

579
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:31,370
Don't you take another step!

580
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,107
Look, if it's me
you got a problem with--

581
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,942
You back off!

582
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,110
James, you wanna have
a conversation with Michelle,

583
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:38,344
<i>let's just do that!</i>

584
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:41,079
Let me give you
a friendly warning...

585
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,781
You watch your back.

586
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,517
I'm serious, James,
this is between you and me--

587
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:45,351
Watch your
bank account, watch your wallet,

588
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:46,785
watch your goddamn dog!

589
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:47,853
<i>Because this woman,</i>

590
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,555
she will take everything
from you!

591
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:57,328
You make 'em stop that!
You shut it off!

592
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,964
Yup.

593
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:01,032
<i>Get 'em to turn it off</i>
<i>right now!</i>

594
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,701
James?

595
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,171
Let's you and I just go
and talk. Just...

596
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,039
No problem.

597
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,640
Just the two of us.

598
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:10,942
I know the best way...

599
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,544
way out of here, okay?

600
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,153
Okay.

601
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,921
<i>Okay.</i>

602
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,756
I want nice and slow.

603
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,358
Let's go.

604
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,292
<i>New deal.</i>
<i>Subject's preparing to exit.</i>

605
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,660
Raf, Jules, go around,

606
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:32,128
<i>isolate Michelle,</i>
<i>and cut him off.</i>

607
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:34,530
- Copy that.
- Copy.

608
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:41,404
Wait. W-w-what's he doing?

609
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:42,538
Ed?!

610
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:51,379
<i>Get down!</i>

611
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:54,282
- Clear the room!
- No shot! Get down!

612
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,919
James Mitchell! Right there!

613
00:25:58,188 --> 00:25:59,354
James Mitchell!

614
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:02,190
They're in the elevator.

615
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:03,657
We lost 'em!
They're gone!

616
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:04,759
Mom!

617
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:12,530
<i>Units have taken care</i>
<i>of the evac,</i>

618
00:26:12,598 --> 00:26:13,965
getting the fire under control.

619
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,399
Spike, the subject
and his hostage

620
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:16,968
have taken
the service elevator.

621
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,268
<i>I know, and I'm on it.</i>

622
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:19,036
The elevator they took
is the only one

623
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:20,436
with rooftop access.

624
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:21,938
- You got control?
<i>- I do.</i>

625
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:23,039
We get him to the roof,
it's contained,

626
00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:24,273
we keep him away
from civilians.

627
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:25,542
Okay, good. Nice.

628
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,843
Is there a security camera
in there too?

629
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,478
That's just where I was going.

630
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,213
And we also gotta have a phone
that we can hear through.

631
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:34,718
What if he gets out
at the lobby

632
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:36,151
and makes a run for it?

633
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,953
I've got full override
and they go where I say.

634
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:39,588
Guys, I'm gonna send down
another elevator.

635
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:40,723
<i>It doesn't go to the roof</i>

636
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,290
but I can get you through
a window.

637
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:43,759
<i>Spike, get the uniforms</i>
<i>to the stairs</i>

638
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:44,894
with Remmy's for me and Sam.

639
00:26:44,961 --> 00:26:46,662
Copy that.

640
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,030
'Kay, there's vents for cover.
You take the low one;

641
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:49,398
I'll get a higher vantage
from the 18th floor.

642
00:26:49,465 --> 00:26:51,033
Let's move.

643
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,834
There's still a
chance we can talk him down.

644
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:53,902
Jules if he wanted to kill Michelle,
he already would've done it.

645
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:56,203
There's something else
he wants.

646
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:07,781
<i>Come on, come on, come on...</i>

647
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,215
<i>Okay, let's break it down.</i>

648
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,084
This is a guy
who's lost everything.

649
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:12,753
<i>I think what he's fighting for</i>
<i>is a situation</i>

650
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,453
<i>where he's back</i>
<i>in control again.</i>

651
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,321
Even if it's the last thing
he controls.

652
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:17,389
<i>This might not be a dead end.</i>

653
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:18,858
He's got May.

654
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,292
It's me he wants.

655
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,761
<i>He doesn't believe</i>
<i>I don't like him.</i>

656
00:27:21,828 --> 00:27:23,796
He wants me, not her.

657
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:25,364
<i>She's the one thing standing</i>
<i>between him and giving up.</i>

658
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:27,667
She is the light
at the end of his tunnel.

659
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:29,968
The talk's gotta be about her.

660
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:36,374
What the hell...?

661
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,477
<i>What the hell?</i>

662
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:41,279
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

663
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:42,714
<i>Someone else must've
called the elevator.</i>

664
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:44,382
I realize
that, bright-eyes!

665
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,783
It still should've stopped
at the lobby

666
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,384
on the way up!

667
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:48,619
James, just calm down.

668
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:50,654
We're gonna get there
one way or another.

669
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:52,623
<i>Stay calm, okay?</i>

670
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:02,131
The most... precious thing
in the world to me...

671
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:06,102
and you took her from me!

672
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:08,738
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

673
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:10,807
He thinks cops
are messing with him.

674
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,108
<i>If we want his attention,</i>

675
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:14,010
he's more likely to listen
to the daughter.

676
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:16,012
Use May as a TPI?

677
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,346
Third Party Intermediary;

678
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:19,481
a civilian involved
in negotiations.

679
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,049
It gives him a reason
to look to the future.

680
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:22,550
She's just a teenager.

681
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,219
Why would you do that to me?!

682
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,254
James...

683
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:28,256
Why?!

684
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:31,392
- Aggghhhhh!
- You're not getting away with it anymore!

685
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,393
<i>James, please!</i>

686
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,528
Spike, turn the speaker off.

687
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,732
What're you doing?

688
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,833
<i>Why are you turning it off?</i>

689
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,300
I'm sorry.

690
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:41,636
Guys, this could be
emotionally traumatic.

691
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,004
Do we wanna put her
through that?

692
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:44,005
I'll do it!
He'll listen to me.

693
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,272
Usually, we try not--

694
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,407
I'm eighteen, okay?
I can make this choice.

695
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,709
<i>Please, let me help my mom,</i>

696
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:50,644
or this will never be over.

697
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:52,779
Boss, she is old enough
to know what she's doing.

698
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:53,680
<i>Raf's right;</i>
<i>May's not a kid.</i>

699
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:54,881
She's pretty together.

700
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,916
Let me talk to him.

701
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:58,818
Go ahead.

702
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:02,421
Greg, I won't even talk
to him if you don't want me to,

703
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,991
<i>but if he sees me up there,</i>
<i>watching...</i>

704
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:07,492
He cares a lot more
about my respect

705
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,494
than he does yours.

706
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,034
Subject's on the roof.

707
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:17,970
Come on!

708
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:20,539
Come!

709
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:25,143
Come on! Come on!

710
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,046
<i>May, we can't control</i>
<i>what your father might do.</i>

711
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:29,213
<i>You got me and Sam on Sierra.</i>

712
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:31,482
There's no way
we'll let James harm her.

713
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,650
<i>It's worth a try.</i>

714
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:34,118
He's heading into an endgame...

715
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:35,553
If he feels that he can
revive his relationship

716
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,321
with his daughter...

717
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,656
Even if it's from jail,
it's something to hope for.

718
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:41,591
It'll feel more within reach
if he can see her.

719
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:48,165
All right, May.

720
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:50,266
But you have to follow
our instructions

721
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:51,702
and stick to the script.

722
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:53,036
Promise.

723
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:54,236
Spike, bring her to the roof.

724
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,805
Copy that.
Let's go, bella.

725
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:00,342
Aggghhhh!

726
00:30:04,547 --> 00:30:05,581
<i>Sam, you got eyes?</i>

727
00:30:07,684 --> 00:30:09,384
In position. I see 'im.

728
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:10,852
<i>You know it's over, right?</i>

729
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,387
Everything changes today.

730
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:14,923
<i>What changes?</i>

731
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,825
<i>This game you play,</i>
<i>this power game,</i>

732
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:20,028
<i>where your attorney</i>
<i>sucks my account dry,</i>

733
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:22,230
where you sabotage
my reputation,

734
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:25,766
<i>where you play hide and seek</i>
<i>all over the damn city,</i>

735
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,267
<i>and your favorite part--</i>

736
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,635
<i>where you write down the rules</i>

737
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:30,838
<i>about when I can see</i>
<i>my own daughter.</i>

738
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:33,573
- I'm not to blame!
- Did you say something?

739
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:35,242
<i>We're almost there, guys.</i>

740
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:37,211
<i>My little girl is eighteen,</i>
<i>for Christ sake!</i>

741
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:38,979
<i>I just wanna hear her voice.</i>

742
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,114
I call her

743
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:41,848
and none of my messages
get through.

744
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:43,916
So, I'm sorry,
but I gotta wonder why.

745
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:46,185
You have her cell phone number?

746
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:47,486
<i>You made me do it!</i>

747
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,421
<i>I had to track you down</i>
<i>and ask you,</i>

748
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:51,924
where the hell is May?!

749
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:54,460
Come on.

750
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,428
All right, listen to me.
I want you to talk about hope,

751
00:30:56,496 --> 00:30:58,263
I want you to talk
about the future.

752
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,497
Look at me.

753
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:01,466
I need you to stay positive,
all right?

754
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:02,634
That's all you need to do.

755
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:04,169
We're gonna be
right there with you,

756
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,203
<i>okay?</i>

757
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:06,204
Okay.

758
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:07,538
Okay. Let's do it.

759
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,644
<i>If she's not returning</i>
<i>your calls,</i>

760
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:14,044
she's choosing not to.

761
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:15,545
- You have to accept that.
- No! You're a liar!

762
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,081
Daddy?!

763
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:21,051
May!

764
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,988
I'm right here, okay?
I'm right here.

765
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:33,263
Look what you've done!

766
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,531
Look what you've done!

767
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,966
<i>The cops, again!</i>

768
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:38,467
You bitch!

769
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:41,137
I need you to get him to focus
on the two of you.

770
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:42,371
All right. Okay.

771
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:43,239
Please, dad,
just let her go, okay?

772
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:44,573
It'll just be you and me

773
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,676
and we can talk
as much as you want.

774
00:31:46,743 --> 00:31:49,412
I have survived,
I have pulled through,

775
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,780
<i>and every time</i>
<i>I think I'm close,</i>

776
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:52,682
you do it again!

777
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:55,484
<i>Dad, I wanna hear</i>
<i>what you're feeling, okay?</i>

778
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:56,819
Why don't you tell me!

779
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,621
When will it be enough?!
When?!

780
00:31:58,689 --> 00:31:59,689
Tell me!

781
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:00,790
Ed?

782
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:02,557
Weapon's not in play.

783
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:03,792
<i>What do you want?!</i>
<i>You want me to give up?!</i>

784
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,360
What're you doing?!
You have to stop it!

785
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:07,028
May, when we shoot,
we shoot to kill.

786
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:08,296
It's a last resort.

787
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:09,798
Can't you just shoot him
in the leg,

788
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:11,433
or do something?

789
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,234
It's too risky.
He could fire by reflex.

790
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:14,869
Don't give up on words.

791
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:16,204
<i>Do you want me to die,</i>
<i>Michelle?</i>

792
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,539
Would that make you happy?

793
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:19,506
Would that work for you?

794
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:20,841
Sierra two, stand by.
On my go.

795
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:22,543
Copy.

796
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,217
Don't you dare!

797
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:31,352
May!

798
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:35,421
Boss?

799
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:37,489
May's got a weapon.
She's got a weapon.

800
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:45,213
Don't you dare!

801
00:32:45,281 --> 00:32:47,547
May, drop your weapon!

802
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:49,116
Hold fire!

803
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,089
Leave her alone!
This ends now!

804
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,556
Okay, she's crossed the line.

805
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:00,127
I've got...
I've got May.

806
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:01,528
I have James!

807
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:04,097
May, drop your weapon now!

808
00:33:04,164 --> 00:33:05,664
May, baby, no!

809
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:07,533
<i>- May, don't do it!</i>
<i>- Drop your weapon!</i>

810
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:10,469
<i>Drop your weapon!</i>
<i>Drop your weapon now!</i>

811
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:11,905
<i>May! Back away!</i>
<i>Back away right now!</i>

812
00:33:11,972 --> 00:33:13,039
<i>May, you put that weapon down</i>

813
00:33:13,107 --> 00:33:14,307
or we will have to shoot you!

814
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:26,551
Boss?

815
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:28,787
Drop it, May!

816
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,591
Boss, she's active.

817
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,696
Greg, she's gonna kill him.

818
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:40,899
Drop it!

819
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,233
Scorpio.

820
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:36,217
<i>I just wanted to see her...</i>

821
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:47,427
Noooo!

822
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:53,500
<i>Oh my God...</i>
<i>Oh my God...</i>

823
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:55,969
<i>My baby!</i>

824
00:34:59,073 --> 00:35:01,940
You son of a bitch!
You killed her!

825
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,310
You killed her!

826
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:05,777
- Who killed her?!
- You killed her!

827
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:07,679
You did it!

828
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:10,249
<i>You don't call me a killer,</i>
<i>you son of a bitch!</i>

829
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,950
<i>You did this!</i>

830
00:35:40,512 --> 00:35:42,846
So it was a complex situation.

831
00:35:42,914 --> 00:35:45,482
It was a complex situation.

832
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,284
In the audio log,
in the last two minutes

833
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,952
before scorpio command,

834
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,854
there were numerous voices,
raised voices,

835
00:35:51,922 --> 00:35:53,456
shouted instructions.

836
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:55,824
The impression it gives is...

837
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:57,260
loss of control.

838
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:01,697
We had complete control.

839
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:04,200
What you heard
was communication

840
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:05,633
between members of my team.

841
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,769
The raised voices were
our instructions

842
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:10,338
to May Dalton, we were...

843
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:13,241
trying to avoid
the use of lethal force.

844
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:16,678
There were... two gunshots
before scorpio call.

845
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:17,946
Yes.

846
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,681
You allowed her to fire
before scorpio call.

847
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:21,415
She raised her weapon,

848
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,649
her grip was unsteady--

849
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:24,452
You allowed her to fire twice.

850
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,686
Isn't that a breach
of protocol?

851
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,521
You heard the audio.

852
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:30,291
We were trying
to get her to stop.

853
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:31,392
Noted.

854
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:34,661
Your sergeant, Greg Parker,
states...

855
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:36,397
She was in the "tunnel."

856
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:37,964
She steadied her right hand
with her left,

857
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,833
and prepared to fire
a third time.

858
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:45,738
She crossed the line,
I took the shot.

859
00:36:45,806 --> 00:36:47,440
After your sergeant's
scorpio command?

860
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,008
At the same time.

861
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:50,810
And are you convinced that
all options were exhausted

862
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,512
before the use of lethal force?

863
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:58,350
What did I just say?

864
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:00,051
Well, thank you for your time.

865
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,886
You know the process.

866
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:07,359
She was right
beside me in the truck,

867
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:09,193
how could I not have known?

868
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,528
Spike, what,

869
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,563
are we supposed to frisk
all our witnesses?

870
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,698
Okay, May said she and her mom
never felt safe, right?

871
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,267
That the cops couldn't
protect them?

872
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,335
That he could track
them down anywhere.

873
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,170
I remember that.

874
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,071
"Tobias has done everything
so that we can feel safe."

875
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,340
Come on, from that,
we're supposed to know

876
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,342
that Tobias procured her
an illegal gun,

877
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,276
<i>which she kept with her</i>
<i>at all times, just in case?</i>

878
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,577
She should never
have been on that roof;

879
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,846
that was my fault.

880
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,647
<i>Boss, don't go there.</i>

881
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,848
We all signed off on it.

882
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,582
<i>It was a judgment call.</i>

883
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,051
<i>She insisted--</i>
<i>you all heard that, right?</i>

884
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,719
She said, "let me go up there,
let me talk to him."

885
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,487
That's irrelevant; She
was emotionally involved.

886
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,722
<i>That wasn't her choice to make.</i>

887
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,524
We made that choice.

888
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,958
She knew when she said it
that she had a loaded weapon.

889
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,960
I'm just saying.

890
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,628
All right, bean bag rounds.
Raf and Spike,

891
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,964
if we sent you from here
and here, and we timed it--

892
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,266
Sam, we don't take that risk,

893
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,834
not when the subject
has a weapon

894
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,569
inches from the victim!

895
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:55,638
I know, but what I'm saying
is we missed an opportunity

896
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,739
when he was distracted
by May coming towards--

897
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,941
I was the one who let her run.

898
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:01,743
<i>I had her, hand on shoulder.</i>

899
00:38:01,811 --> 00:38:03,478
She was safe.

900
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:04,680
<i>And next thing I know</i>

901
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:06,114
she's running into
the line of fire.

902
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:08,984
All right, stop!
Just stop.

903
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:13,588
We did nothing wrong.
We followed protocol.

904
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:18,193
An eighteen-year-old girl's dead

905
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,795
and there's nothing right
about that.

906
00:38:20,862 --> 00:38:22,430
<i>She was a brave girl.</i>

907
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:24,566
She deserved to live,

908
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:27,468
and it is a tragedy
that she's gone.

909
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:28,503
<i>But she knew</i>
<i>what she was doing;</i>

910
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:30,171
<i>she was armed.</i>

911
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:32,005
She was an active shooter,

912
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:33,840
and we have a code,
we have rules,

913
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:37,110
<i>so that when</i>
<i>we are under pressure</i>

914
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:41,248
we function as a team
and we know what to do.

915
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:44,451
This one time,
we could've made an exception.

916
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,452
We could've taken the risk.

917
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,719
We could've shot to wound.

918
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:48,621
Raf, that's a slippery slope.

919
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:49,755
<i>Okay, you know what? How 'bout</i>
<i>I just do us all a favor</i>

920
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:52,091
and say what we're
all thinking.

921
00:38:52,158 --> 00:38:54,627
We could've just held fire
and...

922
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:57,830
let her kill him.

923
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:06,471
No, we couldn't.

924
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:08,106
<i>No, we couldn't.</i>

925
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,375
Because that's not
how it works.

926
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:12,644
We are not judges, we are cops.

927
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:15,213
We're cops and we all-
all of us--

928
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:16,481
have to be on the same page.

929
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:18,049
Okay, let's all sit down.

930
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:19,216
I get it, all right?
I get that's the job--

931
00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:21,151
No, no, no!
We don't get to wing it.

932
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:23,019
We don't get to choose
which rules we're gonna follow;

933
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:24,087
<i>that's what the bad guys do.</i>

934
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:27,658
What we do...
we serve the law.

935
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:32,195
Now, are you good with that?

936
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:35,799
<i>Ed, I respect that this is</i>
<i>what you've gotta believe</i>

937
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,868
to get through this,
after what you had to do.

938
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:39,335
Oh man...

939
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:40,570
I'm just saying,
if that's the job...

940
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:48,745
Look, I am very serious
about serving the law,

941
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,983
and this last year has been
the proudest of my life,

942
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,450
<i>but...</i>

943
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,420
I just don't think this
is the best place for me

944
00:39:58,488 --> 00:40:00,022
to keep the peace.

945
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:04,927
Raf, it's been a long day.

946
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:07,128
Raf, we've all had days
where we've questioned the job--

947
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,729
<i>I know, I get that, boss.</i>

948
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:10,765
It's just, for me, this...

949
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:14,368
This can't happen again.

950
00:40:16,806 --> 00:40:18,639
It won't happen again.

951
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:23,010
Why don't you sleep on it?

952
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:24,945
Give us a chance
to talk you out of it.

953
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:27,747
I appreciate that, guys.
It's um...

954
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:33,320
It's just not a place
that I can go.
