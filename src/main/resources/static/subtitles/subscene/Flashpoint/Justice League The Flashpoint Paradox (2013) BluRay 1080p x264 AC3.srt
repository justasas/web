2
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:20,104
Stop!

3
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,481
You're supposed to stop
for people who need help.

5
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,319
Uh-uh, not so fast, Barry Allen.
Forget about them.

6
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,072
You can't change other people.
Just a waste of energy.

7
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,699
- But--
- Barry...

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,577
...when I was a little girl,
Grandma taught me a prayer:

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,912
Accept the things you cannot change.

10
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,331
Have the courage
to change the things you can...

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,376
...and have the wisdom
to know the difference.

12
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,462
I don't totally get that.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,299
Heh, you will.

14
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,634
Now, all we need is a phone.

15
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,223
There's a gas station.

16
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,976
- Race you.
- Barry!

19
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,183
Mom.

21
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,665
And we may never know
exactly what happened...

22
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,793
...a break-in gone wrong,
a disturbed mind.

23
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,172
But we do know that this was a crime
and a tragedy.

24
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:14,426
And as we commit Nora
to the care of our Lord...

25
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:19,348
...we know her son, Barry, will need
all our prayers and help to see him...

26
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,392
<i>...through this terrible loss.</i>

27
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,858
Happy birthday, Mom.
I'm so sorry.

28
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,360
- I should've been there.
- What?

29
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,364
If I just ran a little faster,
I'd have been there.

30
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,701
Barry, you were just a boy.
There was nothing you could've done.

31
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,035
We don't know that.

32
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,955
If I'd been there,
maybe I could've stopped it.

33
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,206
I could've saved her.

34
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,167
Come on, stop doing this to yourself.

35
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,043
What was that saying your mother had?

36
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,921
About accepting the things
you can't change?

38
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,558
Well, this is something I can change.

39
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,602
A break-in at the Flash Museum.

40
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,646
- See you later?
- You better.

43
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,256
Well, Flash.

44
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:38,844
Once again, it looks like you're the bottom
and I'm the top.

45
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,387
Ha!

46
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,017
Huh?

47
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,064
Mirror Master and Heat Wave.

48
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,108
Going to a lot of trouble
to steal my old junk, aren't you?

52
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,052
Exhibit's closed, Top.

54
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,889
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

60
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,763
Captains Boomerang and Cold.

61
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,140
The gang's all here.

62
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,811
And I thought you forgot about us
as soon as you sent us off to prison.

63
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,188
So this little reunion is about revenge?

64
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,608
Not really.
Offing you is just a bonus part of the job.

65
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,527
Job? Who hired you?

66
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,114
No offense, heh, none of you clowns
are smart enough to pull this off.

67
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,575
You're quite right, of course, Flash.

68
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,204
I knew using these morons
would put you off your guard.

69
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,207
- Hey.
- They're motivated by greed.

70
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,711
They lack the commitment,
the absolute focus...

71
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,047
- To kill me.
- Erase you.

72
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,383
I'm gonna bring this shrine to your ego
down on your head.

73
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,387
Along with 10 square blocks
of Central City and everyone around.

74
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,016
What? What are you talking about?
We didn't bring any bombs.

75
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,894
Oh, but I did.

77
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,108
- What is this?
- Something I attached to your belts...

78
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,735
...as I made my entrance.

80
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,406
I wouldn't unbuckle if I were you.
You'll just set them off.

81
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:05,824
It's me you want, Thawne.

82
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,911
You don't have to kill
thousands of innocents to bring me down.

83
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,622
No. No, I don't.

84
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:17,169
But I choose to, knowing it will
make your last moments pure agony.

85
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,420
Good bye.

88
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,301
You can't escape, Flash.

89
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,847
The adhesive will never completely liquefy,
regardless of speed.

90
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,141
I'm counting on that. Unh.

92
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,438
Now you got not choice, Thawne.

93
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,316
Disarm the bombs
or you blow up with us.

94
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,735
Very well.

95
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,446
If it means shattering
your golden throne in history...

96
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,950
...linking your name forever
to this city's darkest hour...

97
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,619
...then my life is a small price to pay.

99
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,082
I agree.

100
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,503
Your lives aren't worth much.

101
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,174
But Flash's life is.

102
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,978
- You called them.
- You've got your posse, I've got mine.

103
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,564
Clearly, you should never do this stuff
without me.

104
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,607
You end up with crap all over yourself.

105
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,404
Focus, GL. Bombs. Batman?

106
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,989
It's future tech.

107
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,992
Difficult to disarm without setting them off,
even for me.

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,785
I could try to vaporize the bombs.

109
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,872
Yes, but you'd be vaporizing
the Rogues as well.

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,000
Diana's right. What's plan B?

112
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,213
How do we shut off these charges?

113
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,384
You can't. We'll all be dead, shortly.

114
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,636
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

115
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,013
We're out of options.

116
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,475
Each of you take one of the Rogues
as far from Central City as you can.

117
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,728
We'll attempt to disarm the devices
once sufficiently isolated.

119
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,274
I'm not going to just leave you here.

120
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,318
Lantern, we're running out of time.

121
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,862
Hal, go.

122
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,718
Huh?

123
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,265
- I'd suck it in if I were you.
- Uh?

126
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,317
- Aren't you gonna do something?
- I am.

128
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,781
I've got a million microbes
eating the bomb's wiring.

129
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,749
Waiting is the worst part.

140
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,462
You may have minimized
the destruction...

141
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,673
...but the final bomb will still turn
this monument to your ego...

142
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,467
...into your own tomb.

143
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,722
What are you doing?
You can't escape.

144
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,892
You can't reach the bomb to disarm it.
You're going to die.

145
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,063
You may have my powers, Thawne...

146
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,359
...but you have almost zero imagination
about using them.

149
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,993
Looks like 25th-century technology
is pretty delicate.

150
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,091
I've notified S.T.A.R. Labs
to ready a cozy little cell for you, professor.

151
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,551
I understand the food's not great there,
Zoom.

152
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,846
Enjoy your petty little victories, Flash.

153
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:24,726
But no matter how fast you run,
you can't save everyone.

154
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,562
Not the ones that matter to you.

155
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:33,527
Best to keep your mouth shut
if you don't want bugs in your teeth.

156
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,573
Thawne's a classic sociopath.

157
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,743
They have a knack for knowing
just what will get under your skin.

158
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,496
Yeah. They do.

159
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,124
You Okay?

160
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,460
Don't worry about me, Bats. I'm fine.

161
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,963
Nothing I can't run off.

164
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,025
Hmm?

165
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,195
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

166
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,452
I don't mean to interrupt your beauty sleep,
Lord knows you need it...

167
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,580
...but the Elongated Kid murderer
isn't gonna catch himself.

168
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,333
- Elongated Man was murdered?
- Elongated Kid.

169
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,461
What?

170
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,299
Director Singh wants us pulling all-nighters
until we close this case.

171
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,550
Hey, what's going on?

172
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,052
<i>We interrupt our programming
to bring breaking news.</i>

173
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,846
<i>We're live outside the Cold Museum.</i>

174
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,973
<i>Citizen Cold
is battling Captain Boomerang.</i>

175
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,643
<i>Reportedly, the confrontation began
inside the museum moments ago.</i>

176
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,312
Cold is on the loose already?

177
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,939
Do we really have to learn
this stuff on TV?

178
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,150
Doesn't anyone call the cops anymore?

179
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,194
Looks like a power struggle
in the Rogues.

180
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,321
- Who are the Rogues?
- The Rogues.

181
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,697
Flash's worst enemies?

182
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,785
Bent on Flash's destruction
so they can take over Central City?

183
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,996
Okay, we'll continue
this hilarious leg-pulling later.

184
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,999
After the Flash has taken care
of Citizen Cold.

185
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,294
Huh?

187
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,049
Oh.

188
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,052
Barry, are you all right?

189
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,554
Mom?

191
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,229
Mom.

192
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,441
Oh, that was a nasty spill,
even for you.

193
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,068
Let me see your head.

194
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,489
I'm fine. Mom.

195
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,493
It's you. You're here.

196
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,495
Heh, well, of course I'm here.

197
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,289
You promised me
you'd take me to dinner on my birthday.

198
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,418
It's my birthday.
The end of the world can't stop that.

199
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,551
You forgot. Heh, it's okay, Barry.

200
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,595
It's easy for a busy young man
to forget his old mom.

201
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,932
Huh? Oh.

202
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,563
I could never forget you.

203
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,065
Oh, heh. Oh, my.

204
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,236
Barry, what's gotten into you?
Are you all right?

205
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,490
People have been acting so strangely with
this terrible war hanging over their heads.

206
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,535
War? What? No, Mom, I'm fine.

207
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:32,289
But everything else has changed,
and I have to find out why.

208
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,583
It probably has something
to do with me being--

209
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,085
- Gay?
- What? No.

210
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,588
It's okay. I love you no matter what.

211
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:44,467
Mom, it's not that. It's something else.

212
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,432
Brace yourself for a shock.

213
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,185
- I'm the Flash.
- Oh.

214
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,438
What's the Flash?

215
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,691
You know, the Flash.
Fastest man alive?

216
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,569
Fights crime?
Very famous superhero?

217
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:07,407
A superhero?
Heh, you mean like Batman?

220
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,682
Hyah.

223
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,861
Where's the Joker? Unh.

225
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,824
Where, Yo-Yo?

226
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,994
Tell me where the Joker's funhouse
is this time.

227
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,745
While you can still talk.

228
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:40,750
Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue. Ow.

229
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,752
Let me help you get it off.

231
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,925
Judge Dent was kidnapped last night.
Where did the Joker take him?

233
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,557
Even if I did know,
it wouldn't do you any good, Bats.

234
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,727
- He's probably already dead.
- Then so are you.

237
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,408
Cyborg? I surrender.

238
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,243
To you.

239
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,786
Smart.

240
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,500
- Batman.
- You should have let her hit the pavement.

241
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,253
- You shouldn't have thrown her.
- She slipped.

242
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,131
- Aren't you wondering how I found you?
- Thermal vision.

243
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,466
Cybernetic hearing.

244
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,552
And total access to every camera
on the grid.

245
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:36,014
Must be a nice perk for being
in the president's back pocket.

246
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,974
I've told you it's not like that.

247
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,602
As national security advisor,
I can help more people.

248
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,021
Like that murdering psychopath?

249
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,899
Maybe you should go help people
in some other town.

250
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,817
We're trying to help all the people...

251
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,361
...while there's still a world left.
We need you.

252
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,363
"We"?

253
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,077
Hologram party. Ingenious.

254
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,120
Saves a fortune on snacks.

255
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:06,002
Enchantress, Pied Piper, Citizen Cold,
Shade, Sandman, The Shazam Kids.

256
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:10,298
It's Batman. Seriously, Batman.

257
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,177
- He's older than I thought.
- But I'm not hard of hearing.

258
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,307
You know why we're here, Batman.
War.

259
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,726
Over 100 million people died...

260
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,105
...when Atlantis sank
Western Europe into the ocean.

261
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,398
Another 32 million slaughtered...

262
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,818
...when the Amazons
invaded the United Kingdom...

263
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,820
...and renamed it New Themyscira.

264
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,197
We have to take down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman...

265
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,534
...before their war destroys
what's left of the world.

266
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,288
- We can do it.
- That's exactly what Captain Atom said...

267
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,749
...before he flew over there and vanished.

268
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,378
He went in without a plan or backup.
That's where you come in.

269
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:52,090
If we want to win this thing, we need
the best tactician on the planet.

270
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,217
You.

271
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,846
You can't just turn your back on this.

272
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,057
Not when we've got a chance to stop
this war and save the world.

273
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:05,311
War's over, soldier.
You just don't know it yet.

274
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,397
Everybody lost.

275
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:24,205
- Can I help you, sir?
- Sir? Doris, it's me.

277
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,590
No, I don't need help.
Everything's fine now.

278
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,633
Mommy.

279
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,056
- How is my little angel?
- Awesome.

280
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,393
Daddy took me out to lunch
and we had chicken wings...

281
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:50,440
...and I told him about the invasion drill
we had at school today.

285
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,474
Bruce? Alfred?

287
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,534
What happened to you, Bruce?

288
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,247
You were the James Bond
of superheroes.

289
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,540
What turned you into the Unabomber?

291
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,714
Who are you?

292
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:02,095
I said who the hell are you?

293
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,809
Bruce, wait. You have to remember.
It's me. It's Barry.

294
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,061
Barry Allen. Bruce?

295
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,646
- Bruce?
- Bruce.

296
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,649
Bruce is dead. I watched him die.

297
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,401
My God.

298
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,445
He's the one who died
that night in the alley.

299
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:24,117
Bruce died and you lived.
You're his father.

300
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,662
You're Thomas Wayne.

302
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,376
Pilgrim to Mayflower, do you copy?

303
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,172
Where the hell are you?
I'm at the rendezvous point.

304
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,592
There's no sign of the package
or any other members of the resistance.

305
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,720
And I'm up to my neck in Amazons.

311
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,290
You're an American.

312
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,084
But you're going to tell me
a little more about yourself.

313
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,796
- Who are you?
- No. Ugh.

314
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,715
He's resisting the Lasso of Truth.

315
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,134
How is that possible, Queen Diana?

316
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,094
It's not.

318
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:32,185
Who are you, and what are you doing
in New Themyscira?

319
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,815
My name is Colonel Steve Trevor
of the United States Special Forces.

320
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,569
- I'm here to retrieve Lois Lane.
- Who is Lois Lane?

321
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,072
Lois Lane is a Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist...

322
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,991
...who's been embedded
in New Themyscira for three months...

323
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,035
...gathering intel
on your Amazons for Cyborg.

324
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:52,538
She's, unh... She's also one of the most
beautiful women I've ever met.

325
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:53,790
Until now, you mean.

327
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,709
Our information was correct.

328
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,961
Cyborg is amassing the outside
world's super-humans...

329
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,089
...in an attempt
to interfere with our war.

330
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:05,093
He will fail.
Now, find me this Lois Lane.

331
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,972
Yes, my queen.
May I deal with the prisoner for you?

332
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,224
No.

333
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,976
The queen of the Amazons
is a servant to her people.

335
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,234
Nothing is beneath her.

337
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,917
I told you, everything changed.

338
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,087
You have nine more fingers.

339
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,132
I suggest you tell me
how you found out about me.

340
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,886
In my world,
I'm a hero named the Flash.

341
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,139
Bruce took me here, showed me--

343
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,851
I used to be a doctor.

344
00:23:55,685 --> 00:24:00,773
Mention my dead son again and I will
break out my surgical instruments.


347
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:12,743
My ring. Let me show you
that I'm telling the truth.

348
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,288
My uniform is in that ring.

349
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,211
I'll humor you.

350
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,051
See? I told--

351
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:32,889
Not what you were expecting?

352
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,685
- No. Thawne.
- Who?

353
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,770
The man this uniform belongs to.

354
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,357
My opposite, the Reverse-Flash.
Eobard Thawne.

355
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:47,028
- What kind of name is Eobard?
- The 25th-century kind.

356
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,698
He replicated the accident that allowed me
to tap into the Speed Force...

357
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,950
...became a criminal,
Professor Zoom.

358
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,285
Speed Force?

359
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:59,081
The Speed Force allows both of us to bend
the laws of physics using super speed.

360
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,334
He can travel through time.

361
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,463
You're suggesting that he changed
something in the past--

362
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,299
That changed everything. It's crazy.

363
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,219
My mom's alive. You're Batman.

364
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:15,264
And Diana and Arthur
are about to start World War Ill.

365
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,767
But why give me this?

366
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,230
He hates you.

367
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,982
So much he'll destroy everything
to kill you.

368
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,778
But his psychosis requires
that you know he's responsible.

369
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,614
Could anyone, even Thawne,
be that deranged?

371
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:39,372
You'd be amazed the monsters
this world can create.

372
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,666
We have to stop this, Dr. Wayne.

373
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,709
Catch Thawne,
find out what he changed...

374
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,420
...and change it back before Aquaman
and Wonder Woman...

375
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,464
...kill everyone on the planet.

376
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:52,593
Not saying I believe you,
but in your reality...

377
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,763
-...is my son...?
- Bruce is alive.

378
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,890
He's Batman.

379
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:03,229
If I were to help you,
what exactly would we need?

380
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:07,108
Just what's over there
and unbelievably bad weather.

382
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,571
Welcome to Gotham.

383
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,123
I thought you were supposed to be smart.

384
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,751
I am smart, captain. Very smart.

385
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,546
Unfortunately,
having the greatest intellect on earth...

386
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,965
...doesn't always help one
do the impossible.

387
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,634
You better be able to pinpoint
that son of a bitch.

388
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,554
Aquaman's doomsday device
should be easy for me to find...

389
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,806
...simply by locating the power source.

390
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,309
A weapon capable
of wiping out continents...

391
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,936
...would require an astonishing
amount of energy.

392
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,938
Based on my analysis
of the shockwave...

393
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,733
...our course should take us
right over the origin point.

394
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,319
And there's nothing. Not a blip.

395
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,988
I'm taking a big risk
coming this close to his waters.

396
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,325
- How close are we?
- See for yourself.

397
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,669
That's a lot of death.

398
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,004
Even for me.

399
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:13,424
I suggest if you want to prevent further
tragedies of this magnitude--

403
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,783
Battle stations!

404
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,243
A bit too late for that, I think.

413
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,989
Surface-dwellers, my lord.
Not Amazons.

414
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,366
Meddlers, Orrn. They're in my way.

416
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:51,707
Well, at least I know I was right.

417
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,294
No survivors.

419
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,093
This is crazy. You ought to be in Arkham.

420
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,764
Maybe so, but I need to recreate
the conditions of the accident...

421
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,475
...that turned me into the Flash.
Strap me in.

422
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:20,027
You know, they say that lightning
doesn't strike the same place twice.

423
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,196
They say a lot of things.

424
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,490
Now why don't we pull the switch
and find out?

426
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,258
Come on.

429
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,270
Come on, I'm here.

430
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,778
I'm right here!

433
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,097
Oh, my God.

434
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,903
<i>I wish you had better
news for me, Cyborg.</i>

435
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:48,574
<i>This cloud of war grows ever darker,
and I fear we've run out of options.</i>

436
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,787
I just need a little more time,
Mr. President.

437
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:58,208
<i>Victor, there is no more time.
Lex Luthor is dead.</i>

438
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,710
<i>His mission failed.</i>

439
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,297
<i>But at least we know the estimated
location of Aquaman's WMD.</i>

440
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,300
Sir, let my team take
out the Atlantean device.

441
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,971
<i>Cyborg, you did your best recruiting
meta-humans to help us end this conflict...</i>

442
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,392
<i>...but our top analysts say without
the Batman, you have no team.</i>

443
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,811
<i>It's time to send in
the real heroes, son.</i>

444
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,313
The military?

445
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,816
The Atlantean tech will see them coming
from half a world away.

446
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,652
<i>Let our boys worry about that.</i>

447
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,696
<i>Thank you for everything
you've done for this country, Victor.</i>

448
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:31,617
<i>But as of now, you're relieved of duty.</i>

451
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,105
Aah? Oh.

453
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,152
War, war, war!

456
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,918
No.

460
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,220
No!

461
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,187
Lie down.
You have third-degree burns.

462
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,564
You're lucky to be alive.

464
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,321
Somehow I remember things
from this timeline.

465
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,366
How Aquaman destroyed
most of Europe.

466
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,660
Maybe that lightning jogged
your memory.

467
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,246
But I can remember my world as well.

468
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,958
A world where Aquaman would die
before harming innocent people.

469
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:13,881
My memories are changing, realigning
with this new history Thawne's created.

470
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,884
Soon I'll forget my timeline
and everyone in it.

471
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,887
My wife, your son.

472
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,682
- We're getting that world back.
- Huh. How?

474
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,896
We try again.

475
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,066
Try again.

476
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,736
But, sire, the device is too dangerous.

477
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:39,406
Our attack on New Themyscira
destroyed an entire continent...

478
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:42,326
...but still left the Amazon's
new homeland untouched.

479
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:48,624
More unholy magic from those witches.
Next time we will level their island.

480
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,337
Please, my emperor.

481
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,672
We tried to use only a fraction
of the power...

482
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,674
...and now it is even less stable.

483
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,220
I fear we could sweep clean the ocean floor
as well as the surface world.

484
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,512
I see.

485
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,932
Then we will take the witches' island
by force.

486
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,476
Inch by bloody inch if necessary.

487
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,270
They will pay
for what they did to Queen Mera.

489
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:16,318
I told you never to speak her name.

490
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,195
Yes, my liege.

491
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,697
Prepare the armadas
for surface invasion.

492
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,575
The Amazons' judgment is at hand.

494
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:39,800
Because of you, I'll be responsible
for the deaths of millions.

496
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,149
The odds against recreating exact
variables in the original accident are--

497
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,945
Then just try to douse the flames
a little faster this time, okay?

502
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:54,916
Told you I was fast.

504
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,717
This is Lois Lane of <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

505
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,970
My battery is about to die
and I will likely be joining it soon.

508
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:26,073
Earlier today the Amazons captured
some of Aquaman's advance scouts.

509
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:30,869
Wonder Woman's lasso made them
spill their guts, literally.


513
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:51,765
Aquaman is leading his army through
the English Channel tomorrow.

514
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,726
The Amazons are worried
that if he gets his secret weapon...

515
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,229
...past their shield, they'll be vulnerable.

516
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,897
They remain defiant in the face of--

519
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,997
Final thoughts:
If there is an afterlife...

520
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,667
...a cushy anchor job
would not be out of line.

523
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,353
Amazons, be ready for--

525
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,987
Who are you? What are you?

527
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,202
Don't worry, hot legs.
We're on your side.

528
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,830
Yes, fear not, good lady.

529
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,833
Though our appearance
is somewhat frightful, we're...

530
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,418
The resistance, I know.

531
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:05,172
Grifter, Godiva, Mrs. Hyde,
Canterbury Cricket.

533
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,262
And some kind of demon from hell.

534
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:18,143
To my share of chaos I make my claim
and Etrigan is my name.

535
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:21,062
Oh, great, he rhymes.
That's not going to get old fast.

536
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:24,774
Heh, Lois Lane's famous mouth.

537
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,527
I can't believe you didn't get
an arrow shot through it.

538
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:31,531
I would have, if it weren't for whichever
one of you can run at super-speed.

539
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,366
So who do I thank?

540
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:37,454
I don't know what you think just happened,
but there ain't no speedster on this team.

541
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,123
Now, let's get out of here
while we still can.

542
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,924
Never seen anything like it.

543
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,052
Your burns are healing.
You should be dead.

544
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,221
Your bedside manner sucks.

545
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,849
If I didn't have the Speed Force
helping me heal, I'd find another doctor.

546
00:41:58,725 --> 00:41:59,935
I run a casino.

547
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,187
Haven't been a doctor in 20 years.

548
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:06,399
Here. You need a suit,
and I'm not about to loan you one of mine.

549
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:09,444
What? It's friction-proof, isn't it?

551
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,914
I had to at least make some
last-minute alterations.

552
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,583
Very snazzy.
I suggest you take it for a test run...

553
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,044
...and make sure you can break
that time barrier.

554
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:27,712
Once we know that...

557
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,471
So I'm finally on the other end
of that trick.

559
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,283
Come on, Barry. Faster.

560
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,870
Faster.

564
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,897
If you would just slip these
over your shoes, Mr. Jordan.

565
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,734
Sure. Cleaning bill here must be murder.

566
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,444
What's your name?

567
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:36,281
I'm afraid we don't have time
for introductions, Captain Jordan.

568
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:40,368
- Pity.
- I was warned about you.

569
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:43,580
But the president wanted the best pilot,
so you're stuck with me.

570
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,207
Why don't you show me
what you've got hidden away here...

571
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,460
...and I'll show you what
I can do with it?

572
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:52,756
Holy crap.

573
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,799
I was hoping this would shut you up.

574
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:57,677
Crashed in the California desert
eight years ago.

575
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:00,764
Our scientists have been
piecing it back together since then.

576
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:06,686
Its handling capabilities are,
well, beyond anything that we have.

577
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,065
May be a little tricky to get the hang of.

578
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,527
Ooh, and who's this handsome devil?

579
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,196
- Pilot.
- Died on impact?

580
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,239
Kicked off just as my men found him.

581
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,492
Report said he muttered
something in English:

582
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,410
"Beware my power."

583
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,706
Then a glowing ring floated off his finger
and shot into space.

584
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,667
His ring flew away?

585
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,252
You're about to fly
a dead alien's spaceship...

586
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,922
...and that's the part
you have trouble believing?

587
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,173
Touché.

588
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:39,302
You understand, Jordan,
this mission is no cake walk. In fact--

589
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,680
In fact, in all likelihood,
it's a one-way trip.

590
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:45,684
And if I'm afraid, if I want to back out,
no hard feelings, something like that?

591
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,477
Something like that.

592
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:50,563
General Lane, all my life,
I felt like something...

593
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,982
...really special was waiting for me.

594
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,984
Something nobody else
on earth could do.

595
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:59,698
I think I just found it.
So the last thing I am is afraid.

596
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:05,245
This thing is unbelievably slow,
just like me.

597
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,288
You move pretty fast to my eyes.

598
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:10,875
Not fast enough to break the time barrier,
which I need to do.

599
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:15,171
The only thing I can figure is that another
speedster is co-opting the Speed Force...

600
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,091
...keeping me from accessing
enough energy to time-travel.

601
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:23,096
But there is no other speedster.
Not in the real world. My world.

602
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,889
So it has to be Zoom.

603
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:27,142
He's the only one
who could've done this.

604
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,103
He's deliberately preventing me
from changing things back.

605
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,771
Then nothing can be done.

606
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,608
Even if we knew the trigger point,
there's no one to go back in time and fix it.

607
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:37,736
Superman could.

608
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:42,282
I already told you, there's no meta-human
that fits that description in this reality.

609
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,908
I'm not so sure.

610
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:48,580
In my new memories of this timeline,
I saw something.

611
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:52,208
- A meteor. It hit a city.
- Metropolis.

612
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,543
Thirty years ago.

613
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:58,089
The same day Superman's rocket
crashed in my reality.

614
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,388
So this never happened in your world?

615
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,974
- It must be a paradise.
- It's not.

616
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:09,434
But at least there was hope.

617
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:12,061
What makes you think
your space baby survived?

618
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,354
He's a tough cookie.

619
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:17,150
- Where's your contact?
- Don't worry. He's always on time.

620
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,406
I have to admit, I didn't expect your call.

621
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,783
Cyborg?

622
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,997
- Vic? You look different.
- Have we met?

623
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,833
No, he's new. Super-speed.
Goes by the Flash.

624
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:36,294
You still need a strategist
for your little army?

625
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,004
Someone to put together a team...

626
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,298
...to shut down Aquaman
and Wonder Woman?

627
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,343
-L-- Yes.
- I'll do it.

628
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:47,347
But my way, and I pick the team.
Starting with the Flash.

629
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,683
Then we want to find the alien
who crash-landed here in Metropolis.

630
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,769
Alien? What are you talking about?

631
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,103
The meteor.

632
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,023
It's not what your pals
at the Pentagon said it was.

633
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,362
Classified information.
We need it and you can get it.

635
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,330
Why aren't you telling him
about me and the timeline?

636
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:15,375
- I'm not lying.
- You're misleading him.

637
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,877
He has a right to know
what our real plan is.

638
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,755
Don't preach to me.
I got enough misplaced morality...

639
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:23,842
...to handle with the big metal
Boy Scout on our hands.

640
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,344
He wants to stop the war.
So do we.

641
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:27,846
That's all he needs to know.

642
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,766
There's something there,
but it's above even my clearance.

643
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,229
I don't hack into government systems,
Batman.

644
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,689
You do now.

645
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,233
If you want me
on your little suicide squad.

646
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:10,680
I'm cycling the motion sensors
and security cameras...

647
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,849
...but the loop won't go unnoticed
for long.

648
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,726
Early morning skeleton crew.

649
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,978
Well, do your thing.

651
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:37,624
I'm trusting
that this is absolutely necessary.

652
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,251
That's why we're here.

653
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,338
Listen, I don't know
what changed your mind or why...

654
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:47,300
...but with you on board,
we can save the world from this war.

655
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,676
Thank you.

656
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,803
Focus on the mission at hand, Stone.

657
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:50,989
Sir, are you okay?

659
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,410
Is that Clark?

660
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,829
This is the most powerful being
on the planet?

661
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,206
Help me.

662
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:04,210
Whoa, easy there, friend.
Everything's going to be fine now.

663
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:07,547
- Friend?
- That's right.

664
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,384
Cyborg here is your friend.
I'm your friend too.

665
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,310
This must be some kind of mistake.

666
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,564
- A rogue division of the government--
- Keep telling yourself that.

667
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,567
We should have left him where he was.
He'd be safer.

668
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,652
He needs the sun.

669
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:33,197
Don't know if you can understand me,
but what happened to you was wrong.

670
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:35,700
- Most humans aren't like them.
- They're worse.

671
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,618
No. People are good.

672
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,747
In fact, some of them risk their lives
for the greater good.

673
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,750
- They're called heroes.
- Heroes?

674
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:47,003
Don't worry, friend.
Everything is going to be okay.

675
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,796
I thought heroes never lied.

676
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:59,474
Cyborg, stand down!
You have exceeded your authority.

677
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,935
Return the stolen government property
or face immediate fire.

678
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:06,606
You don't understand.
They were using this man as a lab rat.

679
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,649
I don't think they care, Vic.

680
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,780
So beautiful.

681
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:17,366
I have orders from the president
of the United States.

682
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,578
- Maybe I can end this peacefully.
- Yeah, maybe.

684
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:24,624
No!

685
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:54,195
Ugh. Huh?

687
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,500
Friends.

689
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,976
Superman, close your eyes!

691
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,639
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a seizure.

692
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:07,059
Memories collapsing in on each other.
We gotta get him out of here.

693
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:11,439
Fight it, Allen. Don't forget my son.

694
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,900
Yee-haw!

695
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:17,653
Hell, yeah!

696
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,739
<i>Highball, this is Papa Bear.</i>

697
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,158
<i>- Cut the chatter.</i>
- Oh, did I say that out loud?

698
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,409
I didn't know.

699
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:25,369
<i>You're only 1000 miles from drop zone.</i>

700
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:27,747
<i>- Commence radio silence.</i>
- Happily.

701
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,291
<i>One last thing, Jordan.
On behalf of all humanity--</i>

703
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,086
Oh, shut your hole already.
You're ruining this for me.

704
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:39,717
There you are, baby.
Hold still for Highball.

705
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:47,767
Beware my power, asshole.

707
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,456
Continue invasion preparations.

708
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:18,130
- Who the hell is this?
- He's with us.

709
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,967
Now shut up. What's the story?

710
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,262
Some kind of failed kamikaze attack
on Aquaman's weapon.

711
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:28,307
- The pilot was Hal Jordan.
- Hal's dead?

712
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:29,684
That's not all.

713
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,645
The president sent a coalition fleet
to New Themyscira.

714
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,522
The Amazons decimated it.

715
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,774
Troops are being ordered
to Washington D.C...

716
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:39,318
...to protect the president
and members of Congress.

717
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:42,863
Yeah, as our fearless leaders
make a mad dash for the bunkers.

718
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,156
What does it mean?

719
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:49,495
It means the final battle between Atlantis
and the Amazons has begun.

720
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,789
But we haven't even started yet.

721
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:53,499
There's nothing we can do now.

722
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,252
Enjoy the things you love
with the time we have left.

723
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,796
There's bound to be looting
in Gotham by now.

724
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,923
I don't want to miss that.

725
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:03,592
You're just gonna give up
and wait for the inevitable?

726
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,594
Is that what your heroes do here?

727
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,097
Look, you guys may not know me.

728
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:11,851
But all of us have powers,
skills and abilities.

729
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,687
Where I come from,
heroes use those powers...

730
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:18,816
...to fight to make the world a better place,
whether it's their world or not.

731
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:22,361
But Superman--
You said he was our last, best hope.

732
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,698
We're alive, Vic.
And where there's life, there's hope.

733
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:26,949
We'll go to London...

734
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:30,036
...fight both sides
and save the world in the process.

735
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:34,165
Okay. Then we go. Now.

736
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,209
I'll signal the others.
Maybe they can meet us there.

737
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,503
Bruce would have come.

738
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,923
What the hell. Let's do this.

739
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,384
Is the Batplane big enough
for all of us?

740
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,845
The what?

741
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:56,687
Bruce's Batplane was a little more stoic.

742
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:59,065
Your Batman
didn't have to ferry high rollers...

743
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,400
...with deep pockets
in and out of his casino.

744
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:04,362
So he wouldn't need
a fully stocked bar aboard.

745
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,239
Everything is top shelf.
Help yourself.

746
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:09,492
I don't drink.

747
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,036
Shocking.

748
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,705
I'm glad I could persuade you
to come along.

749
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:15,998
You didn't.

750
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:20,544
Ever since I told Cyborg I'd help, I've been
scanning for intel coming out of Europe.

751
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:22,713
During your little Braveheart speech...

752
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:26,342
...I heard an intercepted message
you may find interesting.

753
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,760
What?

754
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,930
Lois Lane was an embedded
reporter turned resistance fighter.

755
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,099
She saw something in New Themyscira.

756
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,893
A super being who could move
in the blink of an eye.

757
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:37,144
Thawne.

758
00:56:37,353 --> 00:56:40,564
If it was him, why let Lane live,
much less help her?

759
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:44,026
- And if he's as fast as you--
- Why let himself be seen?

760
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,237
Incoming!

763
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,377
Sire, the aircraft has been intercepted
and nullified.

764
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,629
Would that all our shots be so lucky.

765
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,673
We have more than luck, Orm.

768
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:06,859
Death to the under-dwellers! Unh.

770
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,362
Kill them. Kill them all.

773
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:28,380
Behold man's final mad disgrace.

774
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:32,176
He chops his nose to spite his face.

775
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,479
You've got to put an end to this.

776
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,482
You're going to destroy the only world
we've got.

777
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,401
You won't have it much longer,
surface-dweller.

780
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:02,414
Plan B: take down
as many on both sides as you can.

781
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:05,125
Maybe we can kill enough of them
to call off this war.

784
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,948
Fight your way to the leaders.

785
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,827
Once we have Aquaman
and Wonder Woman, this war is over.

788
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:13,777
You murdered my wife, Diana.

789
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:17,323
She tried to assassinate me, Arthur.
I was protecting myself.

790
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,658
Yet you wear her helmet like a trophy.

791
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,160
No. A warning.

793
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:34,506
I can't believe I ever loved you.

794
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,008
You never did.

795
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,723
Now!

796
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,736
Shazam!

797
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,824
Captain Thunder.

798
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:06,246
I'm happy to see that a real man is here
to watch the end of man's world.

802
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,396
Fall, damn it, fall!

803
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,327
Sweet.

805
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,840
I like your style, Batman.

806
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:44,011
A pity we never teamed up
when the world still existed.

807
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,722
Batman and Grifter, the boy idiot.

808
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,724
Take your team up the right flank and--

811
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:06,825
Don't worry, Batman.
I'll stop the blood flow.

812
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,577
You'll be as good as new.

813
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:11,163
Don't be stupid, Allen.

814
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:16,502
I may not be a very good doctor, but
even I know a dead man when I see one.

817
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:25,093
- They're gonna die.
- We're dead already.

818
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,679
Find the speedster.

819
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,306
Flush him out.

820
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:32,017
Change all this.

821
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:33,352
No.

822
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,396
I won't stand by while people are--

823
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,530
Hello, Barry.

824
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,406
Thawne.

825
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:51,328
- I love what you've done with the place.
- This is all your fault.

827
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:13,892
This has worked out so well.

828
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:16,270
That's why I let Lois Lane see me,
you know.

829
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:17,938
I knew it would bring you.

830
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:25,237
Not that you wouldn't have ended up here
anyway, you hero, you.

837
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,393
What did you do to the world?

838
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,228
Oh, Barry.

839
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,648
That's the beauty of all this.

840
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,816
I didn't do any of it.

842
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,820
You did.

843
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:53,158
Think, Barry.

844
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:57,204
Isn't there some little thing, some little
good deed you might have done?

845
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:02,209
- I saved someone.
- Yes.

846
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:07,547
I saved her. I saved mom.

848
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,761
- That's right.
- No.No.

849
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,680
It wouldn't have changed all this.

850
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,516
It wouldn't have changed
what happened before her murder.

851
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,643
Bruce's parents, Clark's landing.

852
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,896
Oh, but it did.

853
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:26,108
Break the sound barrier
and there's a sonic boom.

854
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:29,945
You broke the time barrier, Flash.
Time boom.

855
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:33,573
Ripples of distortion
radiated out through that point of impact...

856
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:36,493
...shifting everything just a tiny bit.

857
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:37,828
<i>But enough.</i>

858
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:41,164
Enough for events to happen
slightly differently.

860
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,711
I just wanted to save her.

861
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:50,132
Her hero. How noble. Oh, wait.

862
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,510
You didn't stop JFK
from getting assassinated...

863
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:56,179
...or made sure Hitler stayed
in art school.

864
01:06:56,388 --> 01:07:00,392
You saved your mommy.
You missed her.

865
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:05,647
And in a supreme act of selfishness,
shattered history like a rank amateur...

866
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:09,651
...turned the world into a living hell
moments away from destruction.

867
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,445
And I'm the villain?

872
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,051
No!

876
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,913
This form is not your own.

877
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,790
How is the enchantment broken?

878
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,960
With a word.

879
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,879
Speak the word.

881
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:56,716
Shazam!

885
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:22,367
The era of the land-dweller
is at an end, hero.

888
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:29,040
Your metal skull will
decorate my great hall.

892
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:44,055
Hero.

893
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,184
Friend.

898
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,886
Submit.

899
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,348
You are beaten.

900
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,599
Surrender?

902
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,102
Then what?

903
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:34,606
You'll let the men of Atlantis
live as your slaves?

904
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:35,941
The men? No.

905
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:39,861
You are a pestilence the mother Gaia
has suffered for too long.

906
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:45,617
- But perhaps Atlantis' daughters--
- There will be no glorious victor, Diana.

907
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:46,993
No prize.

909
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:52,666
What I do now,
I do for the good of all.

910
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,085
As do I.

915
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:22,445
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out of here, before he--

917
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:29,286
It's too late.

920
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:42,173
Good job, Barry.

921
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:46,052
The world is about to end, thanks to you.

922
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:48,680
I hope your mother has a good view of it.

923
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:51,933
You can't let this happen, Thawne.
You'll die too.

924
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:56,062
- As you say in this era, totally worth it.
- Unh.

925
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:59,691
Uh-uh-uh.

926
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:04,404
As long as I can siphon off the Speed
Force, you can't escape this timeline.

927
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:07,032
I'm afraid there just isn't enough
Speed Force to go around.

929
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,917
There is now.

930
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:19,627
You killed him.

931
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,379
Not necessarily.

933
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,596
Not if you go back in time and fix this.

934
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:41,066
The only way to save the world
is to keep this world from ever happening.

935
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,360
Take this.

936
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:46,488
Run.

939
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,640
Barry!

940
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:57,600
Stop, you'll kill everyone!

941
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:16,578
Barry! Stop! You have to stop!

942
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,538
Who the hell?

943
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,498
Get away.

947
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,525
Mom, I'm so sorry.

949
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:05,251
- Barry.
- Ah!

950
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,629
Look who's just joined
the land of the living.

951
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,881
Gotta run, James.

953
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:15,094
You don't finish the files by Friday,
you'll be stuck here all weekend.

954
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:18,473
Well, it's not the end of the world.

955
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:26,898
BARRY:
I think I finally got it, Mom.

956
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,567
The things you were trying to teach me.

957
01:15:29,776 --> 01:15:33,071
- Barry?
- Iris?

958
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,371
Mm!

959
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:46,292
Well, heh, that's my kind of hello.

960
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:50,797
- Is everything all right?
- It is now, honey.

961
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,217
It is now.

962
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:58,263
Just to review,
you broke the chronal barrier...

963
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:01,099
...went back in time,
prevented your mother's murder...

964
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,518
...and completely changed
the Timestream.

965
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,354
Nearly destroying
the entire world along the way.

966
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:07,814
Yes.

967
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,108
There's still something
I don't understand.

968
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,776
I remember all of it.

969
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:16,406
Not just what happened after
I woke up there, but my whole other life.

970
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:19,492
I remember every birthday cake
my mother ever baked me.

971
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:22,245
My room, everything.

972
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:25,498
Perhaps some kind of temporal
after-effect?

973
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,711
Or perhaps it was a gift.

974
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:36,676
Yes. A gift.

975
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:40,680
This is my father's handwriting.

976
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:03,494
You're one hell of a messenger.

977
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:05,371
Thank you.

978
01:17:53,037 --> 01:17:57,371
