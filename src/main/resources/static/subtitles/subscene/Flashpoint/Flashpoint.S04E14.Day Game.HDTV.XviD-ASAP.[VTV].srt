1
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:07,282

3
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,118
Ed: 'Kay, listen up.
This guy knows the terrain.

4
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:12,587
We go in hard and fast.

5
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:15,054
Boss, get him on the phone,
keep him occupied.

6
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:16,189
Copy that.

7
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:20,093
<i>Man:</i> <i>What're you thinking, Parker?
</i> <i>I had it under control.</i>

8
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,429
Parker: It looked ragged.
I made a call.

9
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:24,130
<i>Why don't you come on in</i>
<i>and we'll debrief.</i>

10
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:25,365
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>In position.</i>

11
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:26,900
<i>Man:</i>
<i>Well, you know what?</i>

12
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:29,536
<i>I'll bring my sidearm,</i>
<i>you bring your inkblots,</i>

13
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:31,270
<i>we'll see who makes</i>
<i>a better case.</i>

14
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:34,006
Ed, Raf and Sam:
Police! Freeze! SRU!

15
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:36,909
Boss, signal relay.
He's not here.

16
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:40,078
<i>Greg, come in.</i>
<i>Greg.</i>

17

<i>Greg, come in.</i>

<i>Boss, make some noise.</i>

19
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:51,155
He's got Greg.

20
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:01,366
<i>Raf:</i> <i>I know this hasn't
been</i> <i>an easy day for you, Tim.</i>

21
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:03,233
<i>Tim:</i> <i>No it hasn't
,</i> <i>and it's her fault!</i>

22
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,868
<i>Raf:</i> <i>Okay, but I don't think</i>
<i>you wanna harm your wife.</i>

23
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:06,470
<i>I don't think that's how</i>
<i>you want this to go.</i>

24
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,405
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Don't you tell
me</i> <i>what to do!</i>

25
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:10,273
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>She's afraid, Tim.</i>

26
00:01:10,342 --> 00:01:13,977
This can't be easy for her.
You're scaring her.

27
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,312
I don't wanna scare her.

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,613
Raf:
'Course not.

29
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:18,215
'Course not, Tim.

30
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:19,849
<i>So how 'bout</i> <i>you let her go,</i>

31
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,718
and you and I, we can sit down

32
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:22,585
and talk this through, okay?

33
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:24,019
Just the two of us.

34
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:25,855
I'm worthless.

35
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:29,625
I don't wanna scare her.

36
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:32,428
I'm with you on that, Tim.

37
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:37,366
We're gonna work through this.

38
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,000
Aw, come on!

39
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:44,105
See the suicide cues, Raf?

40
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:46,307
Calmness.
Introspection.

41
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:47,576
Doesn't always
mean cooperation,

42
00:01:47,643 --> 00:01:50,779
sometimes it means
he's given up.

43
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:52,480
Come on, buddy.
The first day on the job.

44
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,548
<i>The bridge jumper,</i> <i>remember?</i>

45
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:55,783
Yeah.

46
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:56,851
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>What else did you see?</i>

47
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,119
Raf:
He was tidying himself.

48
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:00,255
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>And you kept pushing him.</i>

49
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:03,091
Again.

50
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,527
(Sighs) Again.

51
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,000
Hey! Who is in the monitor room?

52
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,177
Decklan: We're just
having a cigarette, Gil.

53
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,478
Who's covering?

54
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,080
Would you relax?

55
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,248
We're just giving these
lighting dudes some pointers.

56
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,216
You should be on your route.

57
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,517
Decklan:
Seriously, dude.

58
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,618
Your job's not to patrol around

59
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,353
looking for other
security guards.

60
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,155
You do know that, right?

61
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,623
Yeah, I know my job.

62
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,925
I'm not the one who takes
unscheduled breaks everyday.

63
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,059
Listen, it's 15 minutes.

64
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,593
Either you want to join us?

65
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,262
Or do you can back right off
and let us finish our smokes?

66
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:49,935
(Laughs)

67
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:07,384
(Panting)

68
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,493
Raf:
I appreciate that, Tim.

69
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,162
Now, I'm gonna holster my gun.

70
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:21,431
And maybe we can talk about
what's going on here, okay?

71
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:23,066
I've said my piece.

72
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:23,766
<i>Raf:</i> <i>I'd just like

73

74
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,135
<i>Just talk to me.</i>

00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:27,569
Just tell me
what happened here today.

76
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:29,637
(Gunshot pops twice,
Raf groans, agitated)

77
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:30,905
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>And... you're dead.</i>

78
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,207
Spike:
Really dead.

79
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:33,275
Raf:
You said he just had the 9-mil!

80
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:34,609
Parker:
Yeah, I got it wrong.

81
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:36,044
Raf: - Are you serious?!
Parker: - That'll happen.

82
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:37,379
(Incredulous laughter)

83
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:38,981
Parker: - Let's go again.
Raf: - Come on!

84
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,148
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Zero for nine, Raf.</i>

85
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:41,549
You gotta step it up, buddy.

86

Raf: Ed, I was getting
through to you?

87
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:43,317
I was getting through to him.

88
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,485
Really?
I see a shot cop.

89
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,020
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>Okay, so what's next?</i>

90
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,321
Someone gonna bust through
the window with an uzi?

91
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,555
Parker: Hey!
Every one of these scenarios

92
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:49,623
come from case files.

93
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,392
Every outcomes has happened.

<i>This is real life.</i>

95
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:53,995

Yes, sir.

112
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,284
Oh come on, Eddie.
He needed to hear it.

113
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:55,885
Remember how long it took me
to get that drill?

114

Yeah.

<i>Yeah, 220 of them,</i>

176
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,659
but none where we want 'em.

177
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:50,860
There's no camera in there?

178
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,295
Uh, they're executive suites.

179
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:53,863
You know, these guys
like their privacy.

180
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,064
Eddie?
What do you see?

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,068
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Not good, boss
,</i> <i>glare and shadow.</i>

182
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,436
<i>Hang on.</i>
<i>Boss, we got a bogey.</i>

183
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,605
We got a security guard
on the balcony.

184
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,374
Your guys are still out there?

185
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,408
Decklan: It's gotta be Gil, I mean,
everyone else is accounted for.

186
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:09,344
He must've took cover
on the balcony.

187
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:11,580
Sir, it's him.

188
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,214
Gil calling.

189
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:16,918
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Gil.
</i> <i>This is sergeant Greg Parker,</i>

190
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:18,987
<i>I'm with the Police Strategic</i>
<i>Response Unit.</i>

191
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:20,321
Gil:
Hello, Greg Parker.

192
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:21,455
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Are you safe?</i>

193
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:22,557
<i>Gil:</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm hidden.</i>

194
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:23,758
Hey, buddy,
can you get out of there?

195
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:25,426
No, they're between me
and the door.

196
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:27,662
Parker: Okay, Gil, can you tell
me if the hostage is hurt?

197
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,930
<i>Gil:</i> <i>No, no, no, he looks fine.
</i> <i>He's just scared.</i>

198
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:32,299
<i>Subject is Caucasian,</i>
<i>5' 10", dark hair.</i>

199
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,935
<i>I heard him call himself</i>
<i>"Danny."</i>

200
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,937
<i>He's got a 7-inch blade,</i>
<i>I think it's a bowie knife.</i>

201
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,605
Gil, that's very helpful.
Thank you.

202
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:40,607
Spike, see what you can do
with that.

203
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:42,076
Got it, boss.

204
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:43,043
Parker: Okay, Gil, I
need you to stay low

205
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,376
stay quiet, all right?

206
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:45,712
<i>We're gonna get you</i>
<i>outta there.</i>

207
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,613
Hey, sarge, I think I should
talk to this guy.

208
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,448
No, I don't want you
to do that.

209
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,350
Danny: It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

210
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:52,852
Gil: No, no, no, I hear remorse.
I think I can get through him.

211
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,153
Parker:
Gil, that is a negative.

212
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,621
One wrong word
and he could escalate.

213
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,924
You gotta trust me
on this here, buddy.

214
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:00,258
All right.

215
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:01,226
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

216
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:03,428
Okay, team, listen up.

217
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:05,197
<i>Good news</i>
<i>is we've got eyes inside</i>

218
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:07,532
<i>and, ah, things seem calm</i>
<i>for the moment.</i>

219
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,434
So talk to me,
who're we dealing with here?

220
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,103
It's gotta be a smash and grab,
right?

221
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,404
<i>Parker:</i> <i>So he gets
interrupted,</i> <i>panics.</i>

222
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:14,572
Eddie?

223
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,406
Fits the bill.
He's volatile,

224
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:16,673
he's got no demands...

225
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:18,075
Yeah. I hear a "but".

226
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,543
I don't know, I mean,

227
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:20,644
the place isn't exactly
a liquor store, right?

228
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,346
Jules: - Boss?
Parker: - Yeah, Jules?

229
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:24,815
Money room's three floors up
behind an unmarked door.

230
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:26,984
Cameras, keycard entry,

231
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:28,385
regenerating password,

232
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:30,821
and that's all before
you even reach the safe.

233
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,456
<i>Raf:</i>
<i>So much for smash and grab.</i>

234
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:34,524
<i>Parker:</i> <i>So he's
high-tech</i> <i>on the way in,</i>

235
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:36,360
hunting knife on the way out?

236
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:37,961
Boss, got a partial off CCTV

237
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:38,995
and matched it
to the description.

238
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,063
Our subject is Danny Lucic.

239
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,531
<i>Drugs, assault.</i>

240
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,899
<i>Mostly small-time.</i>

241
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,168
<i>His one star turn</i>
<i>was an attempted robbery</i>

242
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,637
<i>at a credit union,</i>

243
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:49,505
<i>and he took a teller hostage</i>
<i>at knife-point.</i>

244
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:51,206
How'd that end?

245
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:52,508
<i>Spike:</i> <i>Teller got a
punctured</i> <i>radial artery</i>

246
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:55,578
<i>and Danny got three years</i>
<i>hard time.</i>

247
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:00,214
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

248
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:02,917
Gil:
Sergeant, we got a situation.

249
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:04,719
(Heaving grunt)

250
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:06,488
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Whoa, gun in play.
</i> <i>Gun in play.</i>

251
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:08,256
Gil, talk to me.

252
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:10,057
Gil: No, no, no-no-no-no.
Danny: I said stay put!

253
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,526
Roger:
(Pained cries)

254
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:12,959
Freeze! Right there!

00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:15,028
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>No visual.</i>

256
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,130
Gil, talk to me, please.

257
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:18,332
Danny:
Back off!

258
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, calm down, mister.
Just relax.

259
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,769
Parker: - Gil!
Danny: - Back off.

260
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,570

My name is Gil Collins

Danny: If you take one
more step forward

264
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,234
I will cut his throat out!

265
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,103
Eddie, what do you see?

266
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,371
Our civilian's gone cowboy.

267
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,705
He's charged in there
with a big piece.

268
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,341
<i>All I got's his back.</i>

269
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:12,843
<i>We breach now, we are right</i>
<i>in the line of fire.</i>

270
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,478
You guys carry guns?

271
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:17,181
I've never touched a gun
in my life.

272
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,082
Okay... ah...
Just calm down.

273
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,750
Look, I'm gonna
put the gun away.

274
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:23,586
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>I'm putting it down.</i>

275
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:26,656
Now listen to me.

276
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:28,891
That man that you're holding
is named Roger.

277
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,493
He's a friend of mine,
this'd be a lot easier

278
00:10:30,561 --> 00:10:32,795
if you'd just lower
the blade a little.

279
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:35,064
He's humanizing the hostage.

280
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:35,964
Roger:
Listen to him, mister

281
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:37,266
you keep your mouth shut!

282
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,367
And you back off!

283
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:39,934
I'm not coming closer, I swear.

284
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:41,136
Okay?
You have my word.

285
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:42,904
I just... I wanna talk.

286
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:45,006
Okay?
Can we just talk?

287
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:49,378
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

288
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:51,512
Subject's de-escalating.

289
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,248
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

290
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:56,617
I understand.
Your name's Danny, right?

291
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:57,818
How'd you know that?

292
00:10:57,886 --> 00:10:59,587
I was just outside,
I overheard.

293
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:00,988
Danny: It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

294
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:03,057
It was supposed to be fast.
No one around!

295
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:04,158
Okay, but you haven't
done anything

296
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:05,560
that can't be made right.

297
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:06,760
<i>All right?</i>
<i>So let's not change that.</i>

298
00:11:06,828 --> 00:11:09,429
<i>Let's just work this out,</i> <i>okay?</i>

299
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:10,463
I gotta get outta here.

<i>Gil:</i>
<i>All right.</i>

301
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,632
And I wanna help you with that.

302
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
I'm just gonna talk
to some people

303
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:14,668
on the other end of this phone.

304
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:15,868
Police?!

305
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,470
<i>Gil:</i>
<i>Yes, police, okay?</i>

306
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:18,672
But they're gonna make sure

307
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,106
that we all get outta here
unharmed.

308
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:22,242
<i>Look, it's what they do.</i>
<i>It's their job, okay?</i>

309
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,610
Just... let me talk to 'em.
I'm not gonna move,

310
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:25,944
I'm just gonna talk.

311
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:27,813
(Roger coughs weakly)

312
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:30,048
Sergeant?

313
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:30,849
Yeah, Gil,
you're doing great, Gil.

314
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,384
Is Roger hurt?

315
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:33,552
<i>Gil:</i>
<i>Affirmative</i>

316
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,920
abdominal penetration.

317
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,488
Okay, team,
we got a wounded hostage.

318
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,691
Eddie?
Entry options?

319
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:40,157
We got a gun, we got a knife,

320
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:41,693
we got a cornered subject,
we are half-blind.

321
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,894
<i>Alpha, you have got</i>
<i>to get eyes in there now.</i>

322
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,296
Pole cam.
From the suite above.

323
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:47,732

Quick and quiet.

<i>You just keep Danny calm.</i>

327
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:54,539
Will do.

328

<i>Parker:</i> <i>Let him know</i>
<i>I'd like to talk to him,</i>

Right?

330
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:57,307
Let him set the pace.

331
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,875
Okay, I got it.

332
00:11:58,943 --> 00:11:59,643
<i>Parker:</i> <i>And don't

333
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,044

00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:03,380
You do your job, I'll do mine.

335
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:09,519
Winnie, EMS here?

336
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,187

Standing by.

337
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:12,555
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Boss, I found a

<i>into the money room.</i>

340
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,260
It's gotta be how Danny got in.

341

Who's it registered to?

342
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:19,629
Spike:
No, it's a blank.

343
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:20,863
After-market.

Sophisticated, pre-planned.

348
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,237
I mean, either Danny's
seriously upped his game...

349

Or he's got help.

350
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:32,407

352
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:35,277

Yeah. Why?

361
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:51,759
You on shift this morning?

362
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,527
Okay, look,
I took a cigarette break.

363
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,128
It was ten minutes,
I swear to God.

364
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:56,697
You left the monitors
unattended?

365

Yeah, but...

369
00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:03,469
why would I do this to him?

370
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:07,273
I shoulda listened to Gil.

371
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:08,508
Gil?

372
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:09,742
He caught us smoking
this morning.

We just blew him off.

I mean, that's Gil.

377
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:18,249
He takes everything
so seriously.

378
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:22,086

I screwed up.

379
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:24,423

Well, funny you should say.
He just came up.

384

<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Other side of the ledger.</i>

Jules:
And the language.

391
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,407
Yeah, but from cop to this?

392

<i>Spike:</i> <i>I've heard of

You just keep him talking.

418
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:27,448

420
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:31,753
Hey, Gil, how's Roger doing?

421
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,521
Roger:
(Dry coughs)

422
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:34,756
Gil:
Faster's better, sergeant.

00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,224
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>I copy that.</i>

Hey, you never told me
you were police, Gil.

425
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,497
Hey, I got a little bit
on my plate here, Parker.

426
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,802
Jules: All right, boss, Gil
Collins was a cop on the rise.

427
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,069
<i>Breezed through the academy.</i>

428
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:50,505
Couple commendations of merit,

429
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:51,939
but after a few years
on the force,

430
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,874
things took a turn.
Run-ins with superiors,

431
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:56,009
<i>insubordination.</i>
<i>Got busted down.</i>

432
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:57,744
<i>Terminated about two years ago.</i>

433
00:14:57,812 --> 00:14:59,379
On what grounds?

434
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:00,547
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Not specified.
</i> <i>"Unfit for duty."</i>

435
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:01,882
I got something else for you,
boss.

436
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:04,317
I checked Gil's pass code
against the log...

437
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:06,653
<i>About three minutes before</i>
<i>Danny entered the building,</i>

438
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,854
<i>Gil walked the exact same</i>
<i>route to the money room.</i>

439
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,122
Clearing a path.

440
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,525
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Sure looks that way.</i>

441
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,527
Hey, Spike,
where was Danny arrested

442
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:16,161
for that credit union job?

443
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,963
Dundas and Dovercourt.

444
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:19,597
14 division.
Gil's beat.

445
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,900
Parker:
Okay, team, listen up.

446
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:23,101
Things are getting fluid here.

447
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,170
I'm thinking Gil
is our inside man.

448
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:26,939
Okay, boss,
make that make sense.

449
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,706
Parker: Okay, let's say he
set this whole thing up,

450
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,142
it's a two-person job,
he needs a bagman.

451
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,376
So where does he turn?

452
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:33,710
His cop past.

453
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:35,012
Parker:
And Danny's got the perfect MO,

454
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,448
so Gil makes contact,
he keeps it anonymous,

455
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,283
and he tells him
he's got a big score for him.

456
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,717
Sets him up with a keycard
and a map...

457
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:42,019
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>And no one's at the monitors,</i>

458
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:43,754
he cues Danny

459
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:45,156
Perfect inside job.

460
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,391
So the question is,
what is he doing now?

461
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:48,559
Covering his tracks?

462
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:49,993
Eliminate his accomplice?

463
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:51,027
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>Or he got cold feet,</i>

You startled him,

Gil: - I had no choice!

522

Drop your weapon now!

Gil, gimme your hand.

530
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,407
Come on, don't risk it.

531
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,375

Don't do this, Gil.

Raf: - Don't move.

535
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:47,550
All clear, get EMS in here!

536
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:53,689

On it.

542
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:07,103
Decklan,
what was in the safe today?

543
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,903
Uh, some register floats.

544
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,438
Maybe a thousand bucks.

545
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:11,940
And on a big day?

546
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:15,610
Game night? Probably 150,000

<i>Ed:</i>
<i>What are you thinking, boss?</i>

548
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,279
I'm thinking this wasn't
about money.

549
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:20,581
I'm thinking this was about
being a cop again.

550
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:22,717
He set this whole thing up
so he could stop it?

551
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:24,285
Step in and save the day.

552
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:27,054

SRU material after all.

you're the first on scene.

555

<i>but there's a 30 foot</i>
<i>chain link fence between you.</i>

559
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,140
Neutralize the subject.

Lethal?

561
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:50,209

565
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,516
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Try not to think about</i>
<i>what I'd like to see, Gil.</i>

566
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,418
Just answer honestly.

<i>Okay.</i>

569
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:06,692
That's protocol.
You're saying it's not?

570
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,860
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>No, I'm not saying that.</i>

571
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:12,230
<i>Gil:</i> <i>I could call out,</i>

572
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,599
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>And if he does?</i>

573
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,668
<i>Gil:</i> <i>Then I don't take shot.
</i> <i>Obviously.</i>

574
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:18,770

changing</i> <i>your answer then?</i>

575
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:21,172

You're trying to corner me.

<i>Parker:</i>
<i>No, that's not my intention.</i>

577
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:26,311
<i>Gil:</i>
<i>Then I neutralize the subject.</i>

578
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,012
That's it!

579
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,313
No hesitation.

00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:34,484
Ed:
Danny, who set this up?

582
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:36,420
I know you didn't plan this,

583
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,954
so who did?

584
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:42,192
He talks you let us know.
Go.

585
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:42,959
How's he doing?

586
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:44,227
Not so good.

587
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:45,328

00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:48,431
He's not moving.

590
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,198
<i>Ed: - What's down there?</i>
<i>Spike: - Storage room.</i>

591
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:50,666
Could be digging in.

592
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:52,201
Let's go.

593
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:53,902
Okay, listen up.
This guy's knows the terrain.

594
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,371
We go in hard and fast.

595
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:57,873
Boss, get him on the phone,
keep him occupied.

596
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:59,041
Copy that.

597
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,275
(Phone rings)

598
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,479
What were you thinking, Parker?
I had it under control.

599
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,648
It looked ragged, Gil,
I made a call.

600
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:08,750
I had him!
You screwed it up!

601

<i>Parker:</i> <i>Listen, Gil,</i>
<i>why don't you come on in</i>

602

603
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,455
Gil:
Oh, now you wanna debrief?

604
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,989
Okay, how 'bout this...
You know what?

605
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,858
<i>There was a time when a cop</i>
<i>just had to be a cop.</i>

606
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:19,493
Now he's gotta be a shrink too.

607
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:21,228
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Is that what
this is about,</i> <i>Gil?</i>

608
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:22,596
Maybe there's room for both.

609
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,297

</i> <i>New plan.</i>

620
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:45,852
We'll drift-net.
Vertical line, one per floor.

621
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,952
Let's move.

622
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:51,122
Jules: Okay, Gil Collins
first tried out

623
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,724
for the SRU four years ago.

624
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,126
Tactical scores
were off the charts,

625
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,995
psych eval came up short.

626
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,662

<i>After that, he just spiraled.</i>

629
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,636
<i>Fights with his partners.</i>

630
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,671
<i>Problems at home.</i>
<i>Divorced.</i>

631

<i>There's something else, boss.</i>

634
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,115
He filed a grievance
against you.

635
00:22:18,182 --> 00:22:20,183
I don't remember that.

636
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,651

<i>Well, it was dismissed.</i>

<i>for you to be notified.</i>

639
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:25,688
Here's the thing is,

640
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:27,323
I don't think that today
is about proving to the world

641
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:29,225
that he's a good cop.

642
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,328
It's about proving it to you.

00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:34,730
(Sighs and pants)

644
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:38,834

No!
You don't get to talk.

00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:04,116
but they're not complying.

692
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:06,351
Is it "frosty", Parker?

693
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:08,153
I don't know what
you're talking about.

694
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,854
The distress code.

695
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:12,190
Is it "stay frosty"?

696
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:14,959
Yeah.

697
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,327
(Half laughs)

698
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:20,631
Thought it was a little
hot dog for you.

699
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,100
Ed: Raf and I will go to
the last point of contact.

700
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:23,767
Sam, underground parking.

701
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:25,502
Spike, you watch those exits.
Every door, every window -

702
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,870
he does not get outta here
with Parker,

703
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:27,637
do you understood me?

704
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:28,739
Copy, Ed.

705
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:29,840
Let's go.

706
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,511
And of course, here they come.

707
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,413
Listen, Gil, buddy,
whatever you're up to-

708
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,715
shut it, Decklan!

709
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:38,881
Gil?

710
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:40,116
<i>If we got stuff to work out,</i>

711
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:41,317
let's just focus here, okay?

712
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:42,985
If you had let me work it out

713
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:44,187
in the other room,

714
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:45,755
none of this would be
happening.

715
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:47,356
What is happening, Gil?

716
00:25:47,424 --> 00:25:48,557
Plan b.

717
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:53,262
Let me ask you something.

718
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,930
How's your hand-to-hand?

719
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:56,865
<i>Think you can, ah...</i>

720
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,333
Disarm me?

721
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:01,402
No I don't.

722
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,771
See, that's too bad.

723
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,972
'Cause we're gonna go
for a little walk,

724
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,975
and I was really hoping
that you would try.

725
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,011
Turn around.

726
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,950
Hands down.
Behind your back.

727
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,589
Let's go for that walk.

728
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:30,363
Hi.
Thanks for coming.

729
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,430
I'm Jules Callaghan,

730
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:32,999
I talked to you on the phone.

731
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:35,468
Why don't you have a seat?

732
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,337
You said this is about Gil.

733
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:39,572
Is he in trouble?

734
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,907
We're trying
to figure that out.

735
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,875
Are you still
in touch with him?

736
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:45,110
He sees our son.

737
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:47,345
But it's not easy between us.

738
00:26:47,413 --> 00:26:48,781
Can you tell me why?

739
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:51,116
For a while we tried
staying in each other's lives,

740
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:52,818
for Jacob,

741
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:55,453
but Gil has so much anger.

742
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:57,790
He blames me for the divorce.

743
00:26:57,857 --> 00:26:59,257
It...

744
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:01,058
It just got toxic.

745
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:04,628
When was the last time
you saw him?

746
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:05,830
This morning.

747
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,366
<i>Jakey, let's go.</i>

748
00:27:10,302 --> 00:27:11,936
Hi.

749
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:13,037
Gil...

750
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:14,672
I'm sorry,
I know it's not Friday,

751
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:16,873
but today's an exception.
Can I just...

752
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:19,375
Can I just get 30 seconds?

753
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:20,376
Yeah.

754
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:22,179
Thank you.

755
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:23,346
Look, I don't wanna
say too much,

756
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:24,981
I don't wanna spoil it,
but I...

757
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:26,950
I got something going at work.

758
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:28,418
That's good, Gil.

759
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:29,519
I'm happy for you.

760
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,953
Thanks.

761
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:32,188
I know what you're thinking.

762
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:33,856
And that it's been hard,

763
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:37,893
and that's on me,
that's my fault.

764
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,394
But I just want you to know

765
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:41,096
I've never been more proud
of anything in my life

766
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:43,199
than I am of you.

767
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,101
You and jakey.

768
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:48,903
And I know it's up to me
to make you proud of me.

769
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,671
Again.
For us.

770
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:53,741
For us?

771
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,343
(Front door opens)

772
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,744
Gil: - There he is!
Jake: - Hi dad!

773
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:58,512
Gil: Hey, buddy! Guess what?

774
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,613
Special day.

775
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:02,583
I am walking you to school.

776
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:03,450
Great!

777
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,118
Gil. Please.

778
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:09,656
You just love this, don't you?

779
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:12,124
Holding all the cards.

780
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,895
There is nothing about this
that I love.

781
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:25,437
Ah, you know what, pal?

782
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:27,606
I just remembered
I got something I gotta do.

783
00:28:27,674 --> 00:28:30,542
So can I get a rain check?

784
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,245
<i>Something to look forward to?</i>

785
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,513
Thanks, buddy.

786
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,916
Have a good day, pal.

787
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,686
Come here, you.

788
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,222
Please.

789
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:49,093
Tell me what's going on,
Officer Callaghan.

790
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,729
Does the name Greg Parker
mean anything to you?

791
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,431
Yeah.

792
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:56,901
Gil talked about him
all the time.

793
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,104
Gil:
After you flunked me,

794
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,372
I got my hands
on my evaluation.

795
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,672
Go left.

796
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,074
You remember what you said?

797
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,276
No.

798
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,244
Six years of my life,

799
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,246
thousands of hours
on the range,

800
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,948
in the gym,
in the psych manuals...

801
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,182
You don't remember
what you said?

802
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,351
Sorry, Gil,
I do a lot of evaluations.

803
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,454
Gil: "Good tactical.
Unfit to negotiate."

804
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,423
Gil, you have to understand,

805
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,025
we get a hundred applicants
a year,

806
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,961
that's a lot of great
candidates turned away.

807
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,462
Five words, Parker.

808
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,965
You used five words
to ruin my life.

809
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:32,500
Move.

810
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:33,701
Move!

811
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:39,808
Ed:
You all right?

812
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,709
Agh!
Which way did they go?

813
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:42,811
Up.

814
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:46,647
(Monitor beeps)

815
00:29:46,714 --> 00:29:48,416
- There.
- Sam, Spike!

816
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:50,084
Two rifles, stadium floor, now!

817
00:29:50,152 --> 00:29:52,453
Ed: - Stay here!
Decklan: - Got it.

818
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:56,257
(Hand cuffs rasp and clank)

819
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:01,462
Down we go, boss.

820
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:02,963
(Sighs)

821
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,898
Gotta tell you, Gil,
I'm not crazy about heights.

822
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:07,567
Overcome it.

823
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:12,872
Ed:
Guys.

824
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,619
(Buckles clank)

825
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:29,855
<i>Parker:</i> <i>You wanna tell me</i>
<i>what you're thinking here, Gil?</i>

826
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:30,990
It's tactical, Parker.

827
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:32,057
You wouldn't appreciate it.

828
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,692
(Panicked breaths)

829
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:36,094
Don't do it, Gil.

830
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:37,528
Please, you don't wanna
do this.

831
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,930
(Ropes rasp, buckles clank)

832
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,035
Guys, full hay setup up here.

833
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:45,736
Gil:
Oh... sprint shoot.

834
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,171
My best drill.

835
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,707
<i>200 yard dash,</i>
<i>setup up their rifle,</i>

836
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:52,575
<i>dead-center a target</i>
<i>at a half-mile.</i>

837
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,711
Let's set up right here.

838
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,981
Go, go, go!
Let's go, let's go.

839
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:01,118
Sorry, Parker.
Problem is they shoot me?

840
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:02,986
<i>They kill you too.</i>

841
00:31:03,888 --> 00:31:05,122
(Rifles click)

842
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:12,895
He's gonna push him!

843
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:14,096
(Rifle cocks)

844
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,502
Raf:
Hold fire! Hold fire!

845
00:31:21,571 --> 00:31:23,771
(Gil grunts, Parker gasps)

846
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:29,610
We shoot him,
he lets go of the rope.

847
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:31,879
Parker:
(Panicked breaths)

848
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,349
What do you want from me, Gil?

849
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,151
Thought it was obvious.

850
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:37,585
I want a lesson.

851
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:40,454
You got an agitated subject
bent on revenge.

852
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:42,923
<i>So show me how it's done,</i>
<i>Parker.</i>

853
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,813
Talk me down!

854
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:54,058
I'm not seeing tac on this.

855
00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:55,493
Spike: He's got vantage.
Distance. Full control.

856
00:31:55,561 --> 00:31:56,895
Anything we do, he drops boss.

857
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:58,396
He's got every angle covered.

858
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,397
Jules, give me something,

859
00:31:59,465 --> 00:32:00,565
why's he doing this?

860
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:01,832
Jules:
Well, Gil shows signs

861
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,300
of narcissistic personality
disorder,

862
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,702
it's a preoccupation
with prestige and power.

863
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,203
Attention.

864
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:09,172
<i>It's built on shame,</i>
<i>fear of inadequacy.</i>

865
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,942
And when things go bad,
when things feed that fear,

866
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,444
troubled relationships,

867
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:14,978
failure at work,

868
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:17,647
people with NPD they usually
resort to "splitting".

869
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:19,582
Spike: - Splitting?
Raf: - All-or-nothing thinking.

870
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,417
White hats and black hats.

871
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:22,885
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Yeah, it's how he
preserves</i> <i>his self-esteem;</i>

872
00:32:22,953 --> 00:32:25,955
by ascribing his own failures
to the actions of others.

873
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,558
<i>A good guy under attack</i>
<i>by monsters.</i>

874
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:32,027
Can you get through to him?

875
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:34,062
The psychology's
really tricky on this.

876
00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:35,430
He's vulnerable, raw.

877
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:36,665
It's a minefield.

878
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:38,266
Jules, we're running out
of options here.

879
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,702
I'm gonna call, Ed.
I'm gonna call.

880
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,771
Gil:
So. Assessment time.

881
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,272
What do you make
of the subject, Parker?

882
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,508
Parker: Hey, look...
(Gil's phone rings)

883
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:48,977
Sorry, that'll be, ah...
That'll be your boys.

886
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:01,121
They can't help you now.

887
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:02,656
It's just you and me.

888
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:05,425
I wanna have a conversation
with you, Gil,

889
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:07,093
but this...
Wha! Ah!

890
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:11,498
Assess the subject.

891
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:14,100
All right.
You know what I see?

892
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,503
I see a good man
who's in a lot of pain.

893
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,404
The sweet talk.
No, no, no, no...

894
00:33:18,472 --> 00:33:20,507
I see a guy who doesn't always

895
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:23,041
have the easiest time
fitting in.

896
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:26,411
<i>Because what comes naturally</i>
<i>for most folks,</i>

897
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:28,947
the day-today living stuff,

898
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:31,617
just doesn't come
so easy to you.

899
00:33:31,684 --> 00:33:32,751
You're wrong.

900
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,052
You're wrong.

901
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,453
I'll bet when you joined
the academy,

902
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:37,923
all that changed?
Right?

903
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:40,158
Suddenly you felt like
your life made sense

904
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,792
for the first time.

905
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,361
Am I right, Gil?

906
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,663
<i>Am I right?</i>

907
00:33:46,365 --> 00:33:47,798
We gotta get up there.
Try him face to face.

908
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:49,267
Does he look like
he wants company, Spike?

909
00:33:49,335 --> 00:33:50,168
Spike: So what're we gonna do?
Watch?!

910
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,169
Hope for the best?

912
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,704
The electrical charge
will keep his grip firm.

913
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:55,972
Involuntary muscle contracture.

914
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,241
It'll gives us time
to make a play.

915
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:58,875
Come down from above,
and get a rope around boss.

916
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:00,277
And then neutralize
the subject.

917
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:01,678
There's a thousand ways
that can go wrong.

918

Raf: If that.
Sam: Plus he's armoured.

920
00:34:04,449 --> 00:34:05,715
It's gotta take a perfect shot.

921

<i>Raf:</i>
<i>It's all we got.</i>

922

928
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,964
I know how it goes, buddy.

929
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:23,699
You put on a uniform,

930
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:25,901
and all the labels
get rewritten.

931
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,170
<i>"Headstrong"</i>
<i>becomes "dedicated".</i>

932
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:30,004
<i>And "reckless"</i>
<i>becomes "fearless".</i>

933
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:32,174
And all the stuff
that you fought inside,

934
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:35,243
all the demons...
Now they're your assets.

935
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:37,011
Right?
They're your assets.

936
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,247
They're the things

Nice try, Parker, you know.

943
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:04,738
I see that you're trying

<i>But I'm not some meth-head</i>

No, that's not what

It's Greg Parker to a tee.

949

Please, please tell me
what that is.

955

All of it!

<i>He's testing my resolve."</i>

Parker: No, no, there's
a way through this.

1041
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,537
<i>You gotta build</i>
<i>from this moment.</i>

1042
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:40,440
You gotta move forward
from here.

1043
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:42,942
<i>You work though it from here.</i>
<i>You're a good man!</i>

1044
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,313
(Parker's voice echoes)
Here... good man...

1045
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,515
You're a good man...
...A good man...

1046
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:09,667
(Somber music plays)

1047
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:44,900
Spike?
Talk to Winnie?

1048
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,202
- Yep.
- What's in your hand?

1049
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:50,339
It's the audio drive.

1050
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:51,841
Gotta get rid of it.

1051
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:53,175
Ed, what boss said up there
has no bearing on the case.

1052
00:39:53,243 --> 00:39:54,843
It's not our call.
He was torn wide open.

1053
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,110
He was fighting for his life.

1054
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:59,280
There's no reason why
everybody's hear that.

1055
00:39:59,348 --> 00:40:02,417
It could cost him his job, Ed.

1056
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:04,886
I hear ya.

1057
00:40:04,953 --> 00:40:06,588
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Spike.</i>

1058
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,089
Give it to me, Spike.

1059
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,390
Boss, no one needs to know
we used the parabolic.

1060
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:10,858
It doesn't affect
the investigation in any way.

1061
00:40:10,892 --> 00:40:13,260
It all goes in.
Every word.

1062
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:17,964
No more secrets.

1063
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:24,872
How you holding up?

1064
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:27,373
I killed him Eddie.

1065
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:28,508
Greg, he was unwell.

1066
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,142
Killed himself.

1067
00:40:30,176 --> 00:40:32,211
He was splitting.

1068
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,380
He set out to slay the monster

1069
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:35,882
and I convinced him he was it.

1070
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:38,317
Greg, he was trying
to kill you.

1071
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:39,519
He was trying to kill you.

1072
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:41,287
You did what you had to do
here, buddy.

1073
00:40:41,354 --> 00:40:42,821
You did what you had to do.

1074
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:44,489
I got angry.

1075
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,126
I got angry and I lost control.

1076
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:59,036
Parker: Why do you
want to be an SRU?

1077
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:00,938
That one's easy.
Heh.

1078
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,306
Um...

1079
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,509
<i>You know how</i>
<i>when you're out on patrol</i>

1080
00:41:05,577 --> 00:41:07,678
<i>you meet a lot of people</i>
<i>but you, you look...</i>

1081
00:41:07,746 --> 00:41:09,413
<i>Raf:</i> <i>Um, just got
word</i> <i>from the hospital.</i>

1082
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:12,817
The hostage, Roger,
he's gonna be okay.

1083
00:41:18,288 --> 00:41:20,457
Uh, I've been thinking
about this morning.

1084
00:41:20,524 --> 00:41:21,925
The exercise.

1085
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:24,026
<i>I think I know the solution.</i>

1086
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:24,661
Go on.

1087
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:27,997
There is no solution.

1088
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:30,799
<i>The failure, it's...</i>

1089
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:33,269
<i>It's built in, you know.</i>

1090
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:34,570
And it ain't even about
beating the drill,

1091
00:41:34,637 --> 00:41:37,039
it's not that, it's about...

1092
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:41,777
It's about learning to live
with the choices you've made.

1093
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:42,979
My man.

1094
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,018
Boss, I want you to know
that I am honored

1095
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:51,953
to be learning this job
from the best.

1096
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:54,022
<i>Gil:</i>
<i>So, uh... I don't know,</i>

1097
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,557
<i>you take all the things that</i>
<i>I love about being a beat cop</i>

1098
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,059
and all the things
that I'm good at,

1099
00:41:58,127 --> 00:42:01,596
<i>and you multiply that by 10</i>
<i>and that's...</i>

1100
00:42:01,663 --> 00:42:03,063
It's SRU for me.

1101
00:42:04,765 --> 00:42:06,566
So, I mean,
I don't wanna be greedy,

1102
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:10,437
but you know it feels
this right to be a cop.

1103
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:12,272
(Papers flitter)
