- Who is he?

Uh, great.

51
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,894
I need to, um...
Cash out all my accounts,

52
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,029
um, cash advances

64
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,091
but there's $2000 left
on your credit limit,

65
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:51,494
and $800 in your savings
account.

66
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:00,537

Your daughter's education fund?

69

70
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,948
Yeah. We, uh...
We broke down,

71
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:15,417
we're sending her
to private school.

72
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,785
It's a great curriculum,
but it's not cheap.

73
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:19,520
My daughter's begging
to go to St. Adpolphus,

74
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:21,956
just because the uniforms
look like...

75
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:23,324
Harry Potter.

Okay, so she didn't actually
see a weapon?

Ms. Forbes,
I'm gonna put you through

92
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:06,264
to sergeant Greg Parker.

93
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,133
911 has a branch manager
at Hudson Trust.

94
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:11,102
They flagged a client
they believe's under duress.

95
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,203
It's not a gun call, but...

96
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,905
Ms. Forbes, hi.
I'm Greg Parker

97
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:15,907

response unit.

98
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:17,442
<i>Hester:</i> <i>We're not sure</i>
<i>what we're looking at,</i>

but we have a client making
a large cash withdrawal

100
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,078
inconsistent with her
transaction patterns.

101
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:22,279
Okay.

102
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,414
<i>Hester:</i>
<i>She's not armed herself,</i>

103
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,949
but she's visibly stressed,
sweating,

104
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,118
hands are unsteady,
she's near tears,

105
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:29,920
and she keeps looking
towards reception.

106
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:31,488
<i>My associate believes</i>
<i>there's a man there</i>

108
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,124
What makes her believe that?

109
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:35,759
Sergeant,
she's a regular customer.

110
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,393
There's clearly
something wrong.

111
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,328
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Okay, we're
gonna play this</i> <i>safe.</i>

112
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,562
You stay on the line,

113
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,930
get your teller
to stall for time,

114
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:42,832
but show full co-operation,
all right?

115
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,467
<i>But make sure that</i>
<i>both party's are unaware</i>

116
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,468
<i>that they've been flagged.</i>

117
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,669

<i>Thank you, sergeant.</i>

119

I'm sorry, there shouldn't be
any problem at all.

124
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,147
I just have to ask you
a couple of questions,

125
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,615
it's routine.

126
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,617
(Sirens wailing)

127
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:09,724
Raf: So she's taking her own
money out of her own account.

128
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,958
Yeah.

129
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,493
We had five robberies
like this last year.

130

Robbery by proxy.

131
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:15,763
Guy targets a wealthy client,

132
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:16,764
forces 'em to go into the bank

133
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:18,098
and bring out the money.

134
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,700
That way he doesn't have
to put on a ski-mask

135
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,101
and go in there yelling,
"this is a stick-up."

136
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,536
And if it's a false alarm?

137
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:26,573
I don't know,
we could go do some shopping?

138

<i>What should we do next?</i>

00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,223
Get your client out of view
of the reception area

147
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:48,060
and let her know, discreetly,
that help is on the way.

148
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,395
And then inform security,

149
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,331
but make sure the client
is unaware.

00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,470
<i>Yes, it's concealed.</i>

177

178
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,211
<i>Franca:</i> <i>Mrs.
Engles,</i> <i>the police are on their way.</i>

179
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,144
What?

180
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:19,712
Everything's under control.

181
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,214
Oh my God!

182
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,551
(Franca's phone chimes)

183
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:29,489
Ah, yes, she's here.

184
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:32,459
Um, it's the police for you.

185
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,896
Hello?

186
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:39,298
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Mrs. Engles, this is
officer</i> <i>Jules Callaghan.</i>

187
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,699
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I don't understand

188
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,301
why this is a matter
for the police.

189
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:43,668
Okay, we're a minute away.

190
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,170
<i>Robyn:</i>
<i>No, just don't, please.</i>

191
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,373
I mean, it's really,
it's not necessary, please.

192
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,541
<i>Jules:</i> <i>Okay, well, if that's the
case</i> <i>then we're all gonna go home</i>

193
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:51,575
and everything's gonna be
just fine.

194
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:53,644
<i>Franca:</i> <i>Mrs. Engles, did someone
force</i> <i>you to come in here today</i>

195
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:55,746
and take out this cash?

196
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:57,781
You're a minute away?

197
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,884
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

198
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,558
Robyn: Yes, the man
in the baseball cap,

199
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:10,860
in a gray jacket,
he's sitting by reception.

200
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:12,429
He told me he has a gun.

201
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:13,763
Mrs. Engles, I want you to stay
right where you are.

202
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:15,598
Do not move.
This is gonna happen very fast

203
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,300
and you need to be
out of range.

204
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:18,368
<i>Ed:</i> <i>All right, we're gonna
hit</i> <i>the front doors</i>

205
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:19,936
<i>with flashbangs.</i>

206
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:21,238
We'll disarm him while getting
any remaining civilians

207
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:22,604
out of range.

208
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:23,839
You good with that?

209
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:24,940
All good.

210
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,081
(Flashbang pops)

211
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,352
SRU: Police! Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

212
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,088
Get down! Get down!
(Cacophony of shouting)

213
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:45,726
Jules: Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

214
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:48,829
Man in ball cap:
What're you doing?!

215
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:51,799
Ed:
Subject secure.

216
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:54,401
Where's your weapon?

217
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:55,937
What weapon?

218
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,939
Franca: Mrs. Engles!
She just took off!

219
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:58,906
She went off
with that other man.

220
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:00,541
What man?

221
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,861
<i>Franca:</i> <i>The man who was
standing</i> <i>right there,</i>

222
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:05,236
I thought I saw a gun.
They both ran off into the street.

223
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,905
Guys, let's move.
They couldn't have gotten far.

224
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:08,430
Let's go.
Let's go, go, go!

225
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,914
We had her safe.

226
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:12,031
She just sabotaged
her own rescue.

00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:14,673
Assailant: Drive! Drive!
Eh, eh, back, back, back!

235
00:10:14,742 --> 00:10:16,242

- Front.

Right there! SRU!

Go, go, go, go, go!

238
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,449

00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:26,384
Hold fire!

00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:28,253
Halt fire!
Hostage at risk!

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,287
Sam:
We're losing 'em!

242
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:30,321
Ed:
Too many civilians.

243
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:31,723
He's already opened fire, Sam.

244
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,391
I'll take out the tires,
immobilize the vehicle.

245
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,593
Ed: You do that, he'll escalate.

246
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:37,129
He's not on a spree, Ed,
he's trying to...

247
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:39,329
Sam, this is my call.
My call here.

248
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:42,332
Winnie, APB on a grey van,
traveling west on Dundas,

249
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,202
<i>plate 689 4-tango-Mike,</i>

250
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,303
let's move, let's move.

251
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:50,908
She followed him
into the alley,

252
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,743
she's facilitating this.

253
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,978
He's not your regular
street thug...

254
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:57,581
<i>Well dressed, labels...</i>
<i>Definitely into image.</i>

255
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:59,650
Well, this was never
your random robbery.

256
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,618
He's talking to her...

257
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:02,952
<i>And he keeps his distance.</i>

258
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,154
<i>He's not using</i>
<i>a physical force.</i>

259
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,289
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>He's completely confident</i>

260
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:06,490
<i>that she's gonna</i>
<i>follow through.</i>

261
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:07,758
<i>You get this capture</i> <i>to Spike?</i>

262
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:09,025
Jules:
He's running it through records.

263
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,426
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>I got him.</i>

264
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:12,895
Dan Lefebvre.
Ties to organized crime here,

265
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,863
<i>Montreal, Boston...</i>

266
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:16,766
No convictions?

267
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,901
<i>Spike:</i> <i>Guys he works for
,</i> <i>witnesses tend to go away.</i>

268
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,503
Something's missing.

269
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,204
Why would he pick out
Robyn Engles?

270
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:23,606
And why is she helping him?

271
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:26,474
She had a chance to escape,
but she protects him.

272
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:29,344
Did you notice anything else
about her state of mind?

273
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:30,445
She may have been
co-operating,

274
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:33,014
but that was real fear.

275
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:36,117
Okay. Well, maybe there's
something more important

276
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:39,287
right now than her own safety.

277
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,122
Family.

278
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,423
Yeah.

279
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,425
Winnie, call the house,
call the kids' school.

280
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:45,892
I already got the numbers,
I'm on it.

281
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,429
I'll see if I can
track her cell.

282
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:50,831
Sam: So we just stand around till
some cruiser spots the vehicle

283
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:52,366
halfway outside the city?

284
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:53,467
Ed: Where we can apprehend
him without risk.

285
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:54,802
Sam:
We had him.

286
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:55,669
Before the vehicle
even left the alley,

287
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:56,670
I could've shot the tires.

288
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,071
I had a shot too, Ed.

289
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:59,939
Look, you shoot the tires,
the van swerves,

290
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:01,240
he's got his finger
on the gun...

291
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:02,642
We might as well
shoot her ourselves!

292
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,810
She was out of range,

293
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:05,545
the gunman's arm
was outside the van.

294
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:06,746
Ed:
Sam, I hear you.

295
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:08,247
Let's just move on here,
all right?

296
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:09,582
It's over.

297
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,284
Guys, Robyn's cell phone's
a dead end.

298
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:13,886
<i>Winnie:</i> <i>Nobody's picking
up</i> <i>at the Engles house,</i>

299
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:16,388
but the squad car says
the car's still in the laneway,

300
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:17,923
shears are drawn,

301
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:19,191
but their daughter Amy did not
show up for school today.

302
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,826
All right, we gotta get there.

303
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:21,961
Thank you.

304
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:26,232
Jules: House is on Don
Bridge, Hogg's Hollow.

305
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,833
Parker: Let's get the
husband and daughter safe.

306
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,501
They may lead us to Robyn.

307
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:30,669
Sam:
We're there.

308
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:35,573
(Engines roar to life,
sirens wail)

309
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:54,291
What's going on with Sam?

310
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,393
He's challenging Ed,
he's second guessing orders.

311
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,829
He's debriefing
in the street, Jules.

312
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,965
Are you asking me
as your teammate right now?

313
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,333
If I was asking you
as my teammate,

314
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,835
I would keep the headsets on.

315
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:08,104
Hey,

316
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,571
I let this thing go on
between you

317
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,839
means I keep a close eye;

318
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:12,808
that's the deal.

319
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,411
Well, I think that
it's been hard for him, boss.

320
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:19,447
He ran tac for five months
while Ed was recovering.

321
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,050
And he did a good job.

322
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:23,885
Maybe he feels like
he's got more to offer

323
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:25,887
than he gets to give.

324
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:29,024
I think it's more than that,
Jules.

325
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,258
Sam gets his own team,

326
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:33,461
it doesn't just help
his career.

327
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:35,229
I know, we both know.

328
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,531
But then he wouldn't be
working with the best, boss.

329
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,972
(Sighs) All right.

330
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,007
Let's see what we can dig up
on the Engles.

331
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:49,643
(Headsets beep on)

332
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:51,677
(Sirens wail)

333
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:56,950
(Phone rings)

334
00:13:58,718 --> 00:13:59,852
Yeah.

335
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,388
<i>Dan:</i>
<i>Put the daughter on.</i>

336
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,225
Say something.

337
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:08,427
Hello?

338
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:10,095
<i>Robyn:</i>
<i>Amy, are you okay?</i>

339
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:11,629
Daddy's tied up and...

340
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:12,764
<i>Dan: - That's enough.</i>
<i>Amy: - Mommy?!</i>

341
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:14,132
Done.

342
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,234
Please,
just let me hear her again.

343
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:18,803
Please, just let me talk
to my baby again.

344
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:19,804
Mommy?

345
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,006
What's going on?

346
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:22,874
Nothing,

No.

I gave you everything.

You have everything.

354
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,388
If I had anything else,
it would be yours.

355
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:41,024
Dan: This is $33,000 and
some family souvenirs.

356
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,658
That's not enough.

357
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:45,628
Don't hurt them, okay?
We can work this out.

358
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:49,565
How? How?!
We don't have time!

359
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:50,867

Then make some calls!

364
00:14:57,807 --> 00:14:59,108
Move some clients'
money around,

365
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:00,542
get something transferred.

366
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,378
Even if I did,
the bank's already flagged me,

she would stay at the tables

00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,484

519
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,523
<i>Harvey Micks</i>
<i>has got expensive lawyers</i>

520
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:23,059
and lots of employees willing
to take the fall for him.

521
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:25,427
You don't wanna get invited
to this guy's company picnic.

522
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:27,897
<i>Ed:</i> <i>So Harvey Micks finds out</i>
<i>that Dan's stealing his money</i>

523
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:29,732
to prop up a losing player.

524
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,767
<i>Sam:</i> <i>He calls in the money
,</i> <i>full amount, no mercy.</i>

525
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:33,102
<i>That's how he does business.</i>

526
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,904
And Robyn owes what, $300,000?

527
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:37,840
Tim: Yeah, that's after paying
Dan back twice that amount.

528
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:39,007
<i>Jules:</i>
<i>She only has $30.</i>

529
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:40,108
How's she gonna turn that
into $300?

530
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:41,442
You gamble it.

531
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,711
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>He's running out of options.</i>

532
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:44,378
<i>Now, vic said</i>
<i>she's a good player.</i>

533
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:47,348
Tim: Well, maybe she's
gone back to the casino.

534
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,150
Micks' place,
where she's in debt?

535
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:51,052
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Yeah. It's the highest
stakes</i> <i>table in town.</i>

536
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
It's where she's gone,
I'm sure of it.

537
00:20:52,387 --> 00:20:54,055
Okay, let's move.
We'll keep talking.

538
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:55,856
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Okay, let's get to the casino,</i>

539
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,291
<i>tell Robyn her family's okay</i>
<i>and get her outta there safe.</i>

540
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:03,964
(Low hum of chatter)

541
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,170
(Cards flutter)

542
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:17,877
<i>(Roulette wheel whirs nearby,</i>
<i>poker chips clink)</i>

543
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:23,916
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>She's good.</i>

544
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:25,452
I mean look at her job, right?

545
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,719
Stock-trader.

546
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,721
Same buzz.
They get paid to gamble.

547
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,793
Still a big leap from there
to Harvey Micks.

548
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:38,263
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Yeah, it was a
broker</i> <i>from work.</i>

549
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,698
Introduced her.

550
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,199
<i>After the markets closed,</i>

551
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,401
<i>she used to go</i>
<i>to these private casinos,</i>

552
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,269
open around the clock.

553
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,838
(Sighs heavily)

554
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,873
All it took was one bad game.

555
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,275
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>You try to help her stop?</i>

556
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,410
Yeah.

557
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,582
Two months ago,

558
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,750
I woke up and she was gone.

559
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:01,752
Again.

560
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:06,789
(Casino chips clatter)

561
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:07,990
Tim: You are coming
home with me right now.

562
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:09,625
Let's go.

563
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:10,826
Robyn: I... yeah, do you
know how much I just lost?

564
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:12,428
I can't leave.

565
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,562
What're you gonna play with?

566
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,897
We have nothing.

567
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:16,399
Dan'll give me more.
He knows I'll win it back.

568
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,200
I don't care
about winning it back.

569
00:22:18,268 --> 00:22:19,935
I want you home,
it's four in the morning.

570
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:22,069
- Let's go, come on.
- I can't!

571
00:22:23,238 --> 00:22:24,639
You want me to tell Amy that?

572
00:22:24,707 --> 00:22:25,874
Huh?

573
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:26,808
When she wakes up
in the morning...

574
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:27,975
Yeah, don't do that to me!

575
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,511
You don't do that to us.

576
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:30,678
You look at me.

577
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:33,681
<i>Because this is it.</i>

578
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,617
This is your last chance.

579
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:36,984
I love you.

580
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:39,620
But if you do not walk
out of here with me

581
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:40,954
right now,

582
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:43,824
we will not be there
when you get home.

583
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:46,226
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

584
00:22:46,294 --> 00:22:47,661
Everything all right, Robyn?

585
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:49,129
Tim:
Robyn...

586
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:52,232
Dan: Maybe you should
give her some space, Tim.

587
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:56,669
15 years of marriage
doesn't end this way, Robyn.

588
00:22:56,737 --> 00:22:58,270
Robyn.

589
00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:00,005
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Get your hand off my wife!</i>

590
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:06,245
Robyn...

591
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,280
(Crying)

592
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:13,117
Please...

593
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,285
Robyn:
(Crying)

594
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,957
I'm sorry.

595
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:21,660
(Crying) I'm so sorry.

596
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:30,868
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>She did it.</i>

597
00:23:31,837 --> 00:23:33,704
She stopped.

598
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:35,372
She's so strong.

599
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,942
<i>She had not been near a table</i>
<i>in two months.</i>

600
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:40,177
<i>We were paying Dan back</i>
<i>on a regular schedule</i>

601
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:42,745
and I was working like crazy
to find a job...

602
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:45,715
And then someone knocks
on your door this morning.

603
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:46,716
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

604
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:48,518
Now she's playing again.

605
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,128
You try anything,
I call your house

606
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:02,230
and my guy starts
applying pressure.

607
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:04,165
You won't have to;
I just did a hundred thou.

608
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,901
Yeah, well, you better
make it three by noon

609
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:07,803
or he makes an example
of both of us,

610
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:09,204
and we end up in a dumpster.

611
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:11,272
You're distracting me.

612
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,273
Get moving.

613
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:13,408
Yeah.

614
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:23,618
(Sirens wail)

615
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:36,530
There's the van.

616
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:37,864
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>This place is big.</i>

617
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:39,265
<i>Nightclub closed down</i>
<i>last year,</i>

618
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,734
but judging
by the electricity bills,

619
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,836
it's still seeing
some serious action.

620
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:45,671
The casino's operated
out of a room inside.

621
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,674
<i>Sam, what's the John street</i>
<i>exit look like?</i>

622
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:51,143
Okay...
Metal doors, no handle,

623
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,578
<i>and there's a security camera.</i>

624
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:53,546
No stealth entry.

625
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:55,247
It's a problem.

626
00:24:55,314 --> 00:24:56,048
<i>Spike:</i> <i>There's another
entrance</i> <i>in the alleyway.</i>

627
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:57,683
Ed, you see that one?

628
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:59,217
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Kitty corner</i>
<i>to the parking lot, yeah.</i>

629
00:24:59,285 --> 00:25:00,786
Parker:
Must be the player's entrance.

630
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:02,420
<i>With illegal gambling,</i>
<i>we're looking at guns,</i>

631
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:03,621
exit strategies.

632
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:05,957
Spike, anyway we can
get a look inside?

633
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:08,292
Spike: I'm picking up a signal
from a wireless network.

634
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,562
<i>Chances are that's carrying</i>
<i>their CCTV.</i>

635
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:11,896
<i>If I can decrypt the password,</i>

636
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:13,130
<i>their cameras</i>
<i>become our cameras.</i>

637
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:15,232
And you can just do that, huh?

638
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,568
<i>Spike:</i> <i>That's a well-kept secret:</i>
<i>Anyone with wireless can do it,</i>

639
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:18,234
<i>you just gotta</i>
<i>crack the password.</i>

640
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,903
Jules: Confined space,
potential hostage,

641
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:22,138
and Dan's facing an ultimatum
from Harvey Micks.

642
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:23,339
Yeah, that's a of pressure.

643
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:24,942
He sees us,
he could get violent.

644
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:26,309
So how do we isolate the threat

645
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:28,612
without going inside?

646
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,748
We separate 'em.
I'll go in undercover.

647
00:25:32,684 --> 00:25:33,950
Let Robyn know
her family's safe,

648
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:34,817
and then there's nothing
keeping her there.

649
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:36,218
What do you think?

650
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,720
Can't just pull up a chair
and have a chat.

651
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,388
Jules, I can if I've got cards
in my hand.

652
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:43,559
<i>Dan:</i> <i>So listen,</i>
<i>everything's on track.</i>

653
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:44,794
That means you have it all.

654
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,228
<i>Dan:</i>
<i>Yeah, the full amount.</i>

655
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,297
I'm um... I'm uptown now,

656
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,799
so how about I meet you
down at the club at two.

657
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:52,200
<i>Micks:</i> <i>Did you just say
two o'clock,</i> <i>Dan?</i>

658
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:53,434
I know didn't hear you
say that,

659
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:54,636
because if you did...

660
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:57,105
<i>Dan:</i>
<i>Okay, noon like we said,</i>

661
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:58,640
noon's good.

662
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,075
I'll, uh...
I'll see you then.

663
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,176
(Half laughs, ends phone call)

664
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,916
Place like this,
they're looking for trouble.

665
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,183
They frisk me, they find a gun,

666
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:11,418
it's all over.

667
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,753
So no weapon, no wire.
That's it.

668
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,955
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>Guys, I see gamblers.</i>

669
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:16,757
I'm in.

670
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,158
<i>Parker:</i> <i>Did you just guess</i>
<i>at the wireless password?</i>

671
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:19,893
No, but I guessed
that Harvey's IT guys

672
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:21,328
are one step behind

673
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:23,096
the highly illegal
password-cracking software

674
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:24,296
to which I subscribe.

675
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:26,132
Spike, sometimes you scare me.

676
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,900
<i>Spike:</i>
<i>I scare myself sometimes.</i>

677
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,135
Patching the cameras through
right now...

678
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:30,369
There's no audio.

679
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:31,804
Sam: Okay, button mic, one-way.

680
00:26:31,872 --> 00:26:33,305
<i>We hear what Ed hears.</i>

681
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:36,042
I'll hotwire the van;
Block the John street exit.

682
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,345
We secure the alley,
stealth the service entrance.

683
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:43,581
Robyn: (Laughs) Oh my God.

684
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:45,717
Now way!

685
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:48,086
What's that, $120?

686
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:49,187
Bet faster.

687
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:50,288
They only deal one hand
at a time.

688
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:51,356
So bet more.

689
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,658

- Let her go.

Dan:
Stay back!

Okay.
I'm not gonna come any closer.

898

Ed knows we're here.
He'll bring Dan toward us.

You brought him in here?

- You did this to me?
- What?

916
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,522
Dan:
We were this close,

917
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:41,591
but you had to bring
the police.

918
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,492
Robyn:
Why would I do that, Dan?

919
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,328
You had a guy with a gun
to my little girl's head.

920
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:48,030
My husband!

No, you did not have
to steal from the man

in the first place.

925
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,740

- Why?

Why?

927
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:05,246
You coulda just said no to me.

928
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:07,248
Stopped me.

929
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:09,985

00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,726
you can win if you can play it.

933

Until you can't

934
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:25,966
and you drag your whole family

935
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:29,301
into hell with you.

936
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:32,271
I couldn't say no either,
Robyn.

937
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:34,607
You think I would have
put it on the line

938
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:36,042
for anyone else?

939
00:37:37,878 --> 00:37:40,179
I mean, all this time, you...

940
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:42,949
I thought maybe
we had something.

Didn't we?
