00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,081
keep the peace, boys.

60
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,110
who called it in?

61
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,162
a security guard.

62
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:08,555
he says the suitcase
has been there almost an hour.

63
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:09,895
copy that.

64
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:11,234
we gotta keep
that perimeter wide,

65
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:14,201
we gotta keep it locked down.

66
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,924
hey, who was the guy
at the station?

67
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:17,072
danny rangford.

68
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:19,847
most decent, honest cop
i ever met in my life.

69
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,378
the guy's a legend,
retired about a year ago.

70
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:23,197
he's the guy
that brought me into sru.

71
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:23,867
yeah?

72
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:25,589
yeah. him and barney fletcher.
the two of them.

73
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:28,365
they fought to have us trained
in psychology and negotiation.

74
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:31,140
if it wasn't for them,
we'd be straight-up swat.

75
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,862
so he was commander.

76
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,489
never made it passed sergeant.

77
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:35,925
avoided promotion.

78
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,456
why?

79
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,083
keeps you in the action.

80
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:42,911
i thought maybe
it was the booze.

81
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,538
you didn't smell it
off him?

82
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:47,313
you new?

83
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,270
three weeks.

84
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,131
uh, look,
do you know

85
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,567
if anyone's using
the briefing room

86
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:51,332
in the next little while?

87
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,385
mm, i don't think so.

88
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,203
team three's going off shift,
team one's out.

89
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:56,117
good. i just wanna get
a few things in order.

90
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:57,361

91
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,223
go ahead.

92
00:02:58,223 --> 00:02:59,754
i'm just gonna have
a walkabout first.

93
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:01,381

mm-hmm.

94
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,295
strategic response unit.

95
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:06,070

96
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:49,709

97
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,814
inspector stainton.
what's the word?

98
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,867
we're not liking this.

99
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,398
there's been a spike
in terrorist chat

100
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:55,642
last two weeks.

101
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:58,704
station sees over 200,000
commuters a day.

102
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,575
i'd say it has "hot spot"
written all over it.

103
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,968
sam, north containment.

104
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,403

109
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,877

everyone's brain on this one.

110
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:17,078
let's get to know our friend.

111
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,830

112
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,883
mm-hm.

113
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:28,180
there's a file
i've been meaning to look at.

114
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,232

115
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:31,146
yeah,

116
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,347
you'll find it
under team four, 1989.

117
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,453
okay.
what's this in regard to?

118
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,749
ah... just getting
a presentation together.

119
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:40,046
you know. old boys
on a lecture circuit.

120
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,439
uh, it's probably not
on the computer.

121
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,491
uh, look,
if it's any trouble

122
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,214
i can always go down
to the archives myself.

123
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,362
oh no, no, no.
it's no trouble.

124
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:47,894
i just need to clear it
with commander holleran.

125
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:50,382
uh... what do you need
to do that for?

126
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:52,870
oh, i just can't release files
without permission.

127
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,635
it's policy.

128
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,932
uh, well, it's not like
it's a breach of uh...

129
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,272
anyone's privacy.

130
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:59,282
i mean, it was a case of my own.
i was there.

131
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:02,153
sorry, but officially
you're a civilian now, so...

132
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:04,162
no.

133
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:06,172
you don't need
to do that.

134
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,904
look.

135
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,627
the old days,

136
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:13,637
one of us at the desk...

137
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:14,976
we'd have looked
the other way.

138
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:16,795
hm? huh?

139
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:18,134
well, i'm sure
commander holleran...

140
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:22,632
you're not hearing me.

141
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:25,120
i didn't come this far...

142
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,149
stay quiet, mm?
but i can just-

143
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:33,351
no. just stay quiet

144
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:36,413
and look down.
hm?

145
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:38,040

146
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,485

147
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:42,346

electronic counter-measures.

151
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,591
i'll wait here,
you go in and get the file.

152
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,314
fast is good.

153
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:09,525

154
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:12,300

155
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,927
sorry.

156
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:29,622
okay,
i know the subject,

157
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,866
anticipate the weapon,

158
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,110
target the solution.

159
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,354
what kind of person
plants a bomb

160
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:34,598
in a public place?

161
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:36,512
organized personality,
not impulsive,

162
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:37,947
not mentally incompetent...

163
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:39,000
emotionally detached,

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,531
above-average
intelligence...

165
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:42,158
access to volatile material,

166
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:43,306
and familiar with its use.

167
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:46,465
yeah, and who wants to strike
the city's transportation hub.

168
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:47,900
or just doesn't like tourists.

169
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,623
okay, everyone,
eyes and ears open.

170
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:51,154
we may be dealing
with an individual

171
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:54,982
who likes to hang around
and watch the carnage.

172
00:06:58,523 --> 00:07:00,724
it wasn't supposed to go
this way, you know?

173
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,638
wasn't supposed to go
this way.

174
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:03,595
you could've just given it
to me.

175
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,222
all i needed to do was
go in the briefing room,

176
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,561
get a little work done,

177
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,475
undisturbed.

178
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,389
i'll make sure
you're not interrupted.

179
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,442
uh huh.

180
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:12,782
well, maybe you're not trained
for this at your desk,

181
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:13,452
but where i came from

182
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:14,409
we're trained
to profile people

183
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:15,940
and here's
what i get from you:

184
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,567
you're ambitious,
you're serious about your job,

185
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:20,151
you don't wanna be passive,
be perceived as the victim.

186
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:21,395
so here's what you'll do:

187
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:22,734
i walk into
that briefing room,

188
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,553
you'll sound the alarm
first chance you get.

189
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:27,424
i try walking out of here,
same problem.

190
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:29,338
man with a gun,
making unorthodox demands.

191
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:30,582
you see my dilemma?
smile.

192
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,591
hey, kira.

193
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,410
any word
on the air conditioning?

194
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,845
tomorrow.

195
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,386
sergeant rangford?

196
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:40,630
troy!

197
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,257
you hear?
i made sergeant.

198
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:45,511
team three.
huh.

199
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,563
so you haunting
the old barn?

200
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:47,712
yeah.

201
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:57,569
sit down.
sit, sit.

202
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,799
okay, confirming no visible
identification.

203
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,234
babycakes is sending out
a signal

204
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:09,723
blocking remote detonators.

205
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,689
i'm gonna start
with the infrared.

206
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:13,455
good news so far.

207
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:16,326
nothing unusual
in the heat patterns.

208
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:18,431
gonna try chemical detection
for any nerve agents,

209
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,154
blood agents...

210
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,876
sergeant?

211
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,929
inspector, anything good?

212
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:24,365
some of the people
that reported the case

213
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:26,661
said they smelled hay
nearby.

214
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:28,192
so? hay...

215
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,532
moist hay.

216
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:32,308
one woman said she smelled
freshly cut grass.

217
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:33,169
stainton,
so what're you sayin'?

218
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,178
that someone stuffed the case
with hay?

219
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:37,188
boss? hay and grass
aren't the only things

220
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:39,198
that smell like hay
and grass.

221
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:40,729
those people that smelled hay
and grass,

222
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,303
track them down.

223
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,217
they gotta be put under
medical observation

224
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:44,078
immediately!

225
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,035
no physical exertion,

226
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,567
or it'll accelerate
the spread.

227
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,098
spike,
what do think it is?

228
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:48,959
phosgene.

229
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,586
it could be phosgene.

230
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:51,352
by the time you smell it,

231
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:52,883
it's already
at its lethal level.

232
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,505
so, daniel,

233
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:04,462
you and michelle
finally gonna take

234
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:07,716
that round-the-the world trip
she kept asking for?

235
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:12,118
well... ah, maybe.

236
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,649
little hot in that?

237
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:14,798
mmm.

238
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,339
yeah.

239
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,985
you know what?
no, i-i'm good, i'm good.

240
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,612
anything i can help you with
there, daniel?

241
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:29,535
i'm fine, troy.
i'm really fine.

242
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,406
i just wanna be left alone,
okay?

243
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,320
i don't think
that's a good idea.

244
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:38,914
stand down.

245
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:40,637
stay back.

246
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:42,742
stay back.

247
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:43,795
hey! sergeant?

248
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,474
keep it cool, guys.
everything's okay.

249
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,292
okay, troy,

250
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,206
you're gonna keep your boys
at a distance.

251
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:52,408
sure.
sure, daniel.

252
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:54,991
you know how this works,
boys.

253
00:09:57,862 --> 00:10:00,063
kira?

254
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,552
kira,
did you try to transmit?

255
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:03,700
what's up, jules?

256
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,848
i don't know.

257
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:05,997
this is not the way
it was supposed to happen,

258
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:07,145
you know?

259
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,112
never is, right?

260
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,260
no.

261
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,887
look at me.
i'm the subject.

262
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:16,141
you don't have to be, daniel.
we can work this out.

263
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,289
sorry, troy.

264
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:20,065
wait, she's sending
something through.

265
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:20,639
sarge.

266
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,223

267
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,519

kira, you copy?

269
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,103

270
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:29,252
jules, you're in charge.

271
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:31,166
lean on stainton
if you need to.

272
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,505
eddie,
we got a priority call;

273
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:34,706
i need you, sam and wordy

274
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:36,812
lewis, you cover spike.

275
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:39,300
jules, let's get extra uniforms
and detectives.

276
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,640
copy that.
i'm on it.

277
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,267
ed, the priority call?

278
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,894
it's at the station.

279
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,200
why don't you tell me
what's...

280
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,731
don't...

281
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:52,698
negotiate me.

282
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:53,751
okay?
now...

283
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,282
i'm gonna go in here,

284
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:57,100
i'm gonna shut the door.

285
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,248
i'm barricading myself in.

286
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:59,875
you understand what that means,
don't you, troy?

287
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,832
i do.

288
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:03,608
and you're gonna leave me
to my own devices.

289
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:05,522
otherwise, the situation
is gonna get dangerous.

290
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:06,670
you know that, right?

291
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,340
right.

292
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,594
i want you to consider me
a threat level red.

293
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:11,646
you got that?

294
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:13,082
i got it, boss.

295
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:15,570
i'm gonna stop talking now.

296
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,484
threat level red.

297
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:18,919
can you say that for me?

298
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,451
threat level red.

299
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:25,140
that's good.

300
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,341
you're doing a good job,
troy.

304
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:09,257
it's daniel rangford.
he's armed

305
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:11,458
and he's barricaded himself
in the briefing room.

306
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,798
boss.

307
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,276
talk.

308
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:14,999
he's got a beretta.
40 cal.

309
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:15,956
panels hold up to that?

310
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:17,009
yeah, yeah,
they're polycarb.

311
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,061
so what's he doin'
in there?

312
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:19,210
he disabled
a security camera.

313
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,932
he hasn't talked since
he shut himself in there.

314
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:23,038
classified himself
a threat level red,

315
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:24,665
negotiated me
like i was a rookie.

316
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:25,813
are you surprised?

317
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,344
can your team
cover the entrances?

318
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:28,780
yeah. we're all we got, though.

319
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,024
most of my guys
already clocked out.

320
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:30,789
yeah, we're down three.

321
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:32,416
the rest of us are dealing
with the bomb threat.

322
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,565
you want me to call my guys
back in?

323
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:34,330
yes.
no.

324
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,861
eddie...
boss.

325
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:38,924
we keep this in the family.
we can handle it.

326
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:44,091
okay, eddie.

327
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:45,240
nobody gets in
through the front.

328
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,675
garage access only.

329
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:47,919
i'm assuming
he's closed the blinds,

330
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,972
but we still need eyes in.

331
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:50,120
so grab
some rangefinders,

332
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,365
go outside,
double-check.

333
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:52,034
copy that.

334
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:54,235
wordy? he's gonna be
looking for the snake,

335
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:55,671
so let's use
the fiber cam.

336
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:56,341
got it.

337
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,351
auto-transcriptor, boss?

338
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:00,934
we don't need it.

339
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:03,231
jules has it anyway.

340
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:04,954
it can just be for us,
or...

341
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:08,973
or what, greg?
when this is over, okay?

342
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:10,313
all right.

343
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:11,653
let's use team three's.
you set it up.

344
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:13,662
but call his wife first.
her name is michelle.

345
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:14,141
let's figure out

346
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,246
what's been going on at home
lately, okay?

347
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:17,682
on it.
'kay.

348
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:20,170
i want you to talk to him.
okay?

349
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,127
none of us
can stay objective.

350
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:24,285
but you know him best.

351
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:25,338
yeah.

352
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,209
all right, good.
kira, walk with me.

353
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,960
so what do we know
about phosgene?

354
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,066
it's not hard to make
and it's nasty.

355
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,075
it could take 24 hours
to show symptoms.

356
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,372
so your victims don't even know
they've been exposed...

357
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:43,712
until their lungs
stop working.

358
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:45,434
okay, well stainton's
on top of the med reports.

359
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,678
i'll tell him
to alert his units

360
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:48,784
for a potential
chemical evac order.

361
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:51,081
maybe we need to block
incoming trains as well.

362
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:51,942
anything else?

363
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:53,090
get him to broaden
the perimeter,

364
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,526
especially downwind.

365
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:55,100
got it.

366
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,067
okay, babycakes,
let's take a look inside.

367
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:04,574
danny?

368
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:08,306
what's this i'm hearing about
you being in there with a gun?

369
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,838
huh?

370
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:12,230
tellin' troy
it's threat level red?

371
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,302
danny, come on.
last time we talked

372
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:18,546
threat level red was code

373
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:22,183
for "there's a wife
in the station."

374
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:24,958
it's just me out here,
danny.

375
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,776
it's eddie.

376
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,083
kira, what happened?
he seemed fine when we left.

377
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,518
i mean, how did he seem to you?

378
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,528
calm, at first.
well, sweating a lot.

379
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:35,963
yeah, well,
we all are, right?

380
00:14:35,963 --> 00:14:37,782
but steady eye contact,

381
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:39,696
relaxed posture,
chatty...

382
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:42,088
then, when i wouldn't
get the file for him,

383
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,768
he came off the rails,
like that wasn't the plan.

384
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,299
what do you think
the plan was?

385
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,065
???

386
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:47,639
getting the file,

387
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,510
preparing a presentation
in the briefing room.

388
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,658
he wanted privacy.

389
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,476
think he wanted to leave
the station with that file?

390
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,816
no, i don't think so.

391
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:56,252
and he didn't want
holleran alerted, right?

392
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:57,687
that's right.

393
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:00,654
remember anything
about the file?

394
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:02,376
name on it was gehring.
1989.

395
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,003
'89.
so there's no computer backup.

396
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,534
anything about that case?

397
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,257
just that it was his.
sorry.

398
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:08,692
no, no, you did everything
right, kira.

399
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:09,075
thank you.

400
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,702
you can go home.
you're free to do that.

401
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,860
hey, i'm not going anywhere.
i'm a cop too.

402
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,817
okay.

403
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:17,018
put on a vest and radio.

404
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:18,549

405
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:19,698
his name
and number's on file.

406
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:21,708
he was on daniel's team;
they retired same year.

407
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,483

sooner than asap.

408
00:15:24,483 --> 00:15:25,727
eddie,
how's our friend?

409
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,067
he's not talking.

410
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:29,172
i got eyes in.

411
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:41,900
fiber optic neutralized.

412
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,527
troy,
you got eyes outside?

413
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,292
he's moving.

414
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:46,589
looks like he's closing
the shutters.

415
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:47,642
wanna try the ball cam?

416
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,365
he's gonna be looking for that.
let's get thermals.

417
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,991
okay,
i got it right here.

418
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:57,212
danny?

419
00:15:57,212 --> 00:16:00,466
you sticky
my fiber optic camera?

420
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:03,815
nice job.
what'd you use, duct tape?

421
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:06,112
forgot how much you liked it
low tech.

422
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:11,949
remember that corner store
barricade, danny?

423
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:13,194
day like today -
hotter than hell.

424
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:14,725
you remember that?

425
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,830
you had me talk to those kids
for an hour and a half, danny.

426
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,935
then you came in,
turned up the heat,

427
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:21,711
20 minutes later,
they came running out.

428
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,816
and that was low tech
all the way.

429
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,634
thought you were on
a bomb call, ed.

430
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,261
we're on it.

431
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,558
just came back here
to see what was going on.

432
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:31,281
i'm not here to negotiate you,
danny.

433
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,716
i just wanna help you
figure it out.

434
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:34,822
all you've done for me
over the years?

435
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:35,778
come on.

436
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:36,927
back to your bomb call.

437
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:39,032
spike's on it.
danny, you know the bomb guys!

438
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,382
you know what's good for you,
you stay out of here.

439
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,870
i'm not going anywhere.

440
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,741
i'm gonna stay right here,
long as it takes.

441
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:51,377
danny, what're you saying to me?
how long?

442
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,909
oh, uh...

443
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:55,684
about 14 more ounces.

444
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:06,976
11:27 am barricaded subject
daniel rangford.

445
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:09,465
boss, how do you want me
to characterize the subject?

446
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:10,517
barricaded.

447
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:11,857
leave it at that.

448
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:12,814
you talk to his wife?

449
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:13,867
yes. i called her,

450
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,206
i told her husband
was at the station

451
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:17,120
and she got really upset;
she hung up on me.

452
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,747
sru!

453
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,374

455
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:23,245
eddie?

456
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,681
he's shooting at nothing.
he's shooting at a chair.

457
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,403
i got thermals.

458
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,647

459
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,509

461
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,762
danny, our weapons
are not raised!

462
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,389

danny,
it's greg parker.

466
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:47,266
what's going on, buddy?
what're you shooting at?

467
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:02,386
what's going on?
i don't know.

468
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:03,917
he's shooting at somebody
who's not there.

469
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,970
is it an hallucination?

470
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,267
yeah, maybe a flashback
or something.

471
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,702
where's daniel?
i wanna see him!

472
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:10,138

all right, that's enough.
i'm gonna open it up.

496
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:56,456
he said he was gonna fire.

497
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:57,317
you wanna spend the rest
of your life

498
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,423
thinking about what
we should've done, wordy? huh?

499
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,049
okay.
wordy, cover.

500
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:02,772

00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:22,390
let's slow this down,
danny.

504
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,922
close the damn door!

505
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:26,505
i'm not gonna be able
to do that, dan.

506
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:28,132
one step closer?

507
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:30,142
we're done.

508
00:19:30,142 --> 00:19:31,482
okay.

509
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:33,396
let the subject set the pace,
huh?

510
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,310
don't rush a negotiation.

511
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,128
'cause i'm not finished here

512
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,851

513
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:40,382

i'll go talk to michelle.

518
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:48,708
i think he's slowing up,

519
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,909
so let's just keep him
on his timetable, okay?

520
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,153

00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:02,297
that's not gonna happen.

525
00:20:02,297 --> 00:20:04,211
i gotta talk to him.
he'll listen to me.

526
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:05,168
harvey,
this isn't a good idea.

527
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:07,752
this is, this is garbage.
i can't just stand here.

528
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,378
harvey, there's not a guy here
who feels different,

529
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:11,867
but we just need to streamline
the inputs a little, okay?

530
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,259

535
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:24,212
about the gehring incident,
1989.

536
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:38,758
this is not good.

537
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:40,385
we got a possible i.e.d.

538
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:42,873
batteries, wire, pipe...

539
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:43,734
is that shrapnel?

540
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,840
could be. it's not nails
or ball bearings -

541
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,467
some kind of small objects
though.

542
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,285
this thing could be on a timer,
it could be motion-sensitive,

543
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:50,912
so we're not taking it
anywhere.

544
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:52,634
we detonate it here,
in the square?

545
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:53,209
negative.

546
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,931
detonating will only release
more gas.

547
00:20:54,931 --> 00:20:56,941
we do a render-safe
with a water cannon.

548
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:59,908
okay.
we gotta disrupt the mechanism.

549
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:03,066
and turn the phosgene
into hydrochloric acid.

550
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:09,095
i promise you'll see him
as soon as we know it's safe.

551
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:10,147
safe?

552
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:11,583
michelle, we need to understand
what he's doing,

553
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,305
where he's coming from.

554
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,932
can you help us?

555
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:16,081
yeah.
'course i'll help.

556
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:18,282
thank you, 'cause i'm...

557
00:21:18,282 --> 00:21:20,291
'cause you're the one
who knows him best.

558
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,631
you think?

559
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:24,215
i know the guy i married.
i remember him.

560
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:26,799
this guy?

561
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,053
i mean, i was counting the days
'til he retired.

562
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,062
'til he came back to us -

563
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:34,838
to me and liam.

564
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:36,560
wake up to the world,

565
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,623
have a bbq,
put up his feet,

566
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:41,728
enjoy.
something.

567
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:43,642
didn't work out that way,
huh?

568
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,460
no.

569
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,523
'cause when he took off
the uniform...

570
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:51,298
it turns out there was
nothing left underneath.

571
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,667
almost there.

572
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:01,059
all right, we just gotta get
past the part of him

573
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,495
that sticks to a plan.

574
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:06,418
so... maybe we bypass
the logic brain,

575
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:07,854
force him to run
out of there.

576
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:10,246
thinking about tear gas?

577
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,490
the animal instinct
in the midbrain

578
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,404
thinks it's drowning,
running for air.

579
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:14,935
well,
i don't recommend it.

580
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,467
why's that, danny?

581
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:19,242
you'd have to evacuate
the whole building for 3 days,

582
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:21,730
just to breathe in here...

583
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,601
and 3 weeks
with a sanitation crew.

584
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,419
we're not worried
about making messes, danny.

585
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:28,620
think it through, boys.

586
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,630
you wanna cripple the sru?

587
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,214
all on the gamble
that i didn't think of, uh,

588
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:36,276
packing a gas mask
in this bag?

589
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:40,009
does he let you
touch him?

590
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:42,784
no he doesn't.

591
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:46,420
and i don't mean
just ibed.

592
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,014
i try to hold his hand,
he pulls away.

593
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:51,971
the last time he touched me,

594
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,502
i woke up with his hands
around my neck

595
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:56,565
and he was screaming
at me.

596
00:22:56,565 --> 00:23:00,680
he's been hanging off a cliff
all these years.

597
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,211
he won't talk to me.

598
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:04,508
not about work,
he never has.

599
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,517
and he won't talk to you

600
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,527
'cause he knows...

601
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:09,867
you'll shake your heads,
"oh, so sad

602
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,206
to see the great guy fall.

603
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,546
what happened to him?

604
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:14,652
we thought
he could hack it?"

605
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:15,322
then you'll turn
your backs,

606
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:16,470
so that you can keep
on pretending

607
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,767
that he's the exception.

608
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:26,614
michelle, it's gonna be okay.

609
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,858
it's okay.

610
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:30,729
danny,

611
00:23:30,729 --> 00:23:33,696
we are not playing chess
here now.

612
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:36,184
you're thinking about
a permanent solution

613
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:38,289
to a temporary problem.

614
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,203
i appreciate your faith, ed,
but...

615
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:41,734
all right,
then you gotta appreciate...

616
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:43,266
don't interrupt
the subject!

617
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:44,605
don't "handbook" me,
danny.

618
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:47,955
danny, faith is what you need
when there is no proof.

619
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:50,634
we don't need faith to know
that you deserve to live.

620
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:51,783
(heavy breaths
oh yeah?

621
00:23:51,783 --> 00:23:53,314
that's something
you can prove?

622
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:55,898
yeah.
yeah, i think i can.

623
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:58,195
let's talk about all the people
whose lives were made longer

624
00:23:58,195 --> 00:23:59,152
because of you.

625
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:01,831
don't start.

626
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:02,980
the gehring incident...

627
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,372
it was a home invasion,
regent park,

628
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:07,095
but this little place
was neat as a pin.

629
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,487
you know who's keeping house?
a little 18-year-old girl.

630
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:10,635
parents are both deadbeats,

631
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,932
one's in jail,
one's awol...

632
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:13,985
she's holding it
all together,

633
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,569
looking after
her little brother and sister.

634
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:17,717
what happened
with the home invasion?

635
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,631
by the time we got on-scene,
bad guys had gone:

636
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:21,067
the girl, she'd taken a whack
at one of the guys

637
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:21,832
with a baseball bat,

638
00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:23,172
scared 'em away.

639
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,852
so, team went back out
on patrol

640
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:28,340
and danny and i stayed behind
to write it up.

641
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,297
that was it?

642
00:24:29,297 --> 00:24:30,732
the little guy,
10-years-old,

643
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:33,220
he wanted to show us
his baseball card collection.

644
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,900
i said "no, we gotta go,"
and danny said "no, let's stay."

645
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,335
he just bought a fresh pack
for his own son,

646
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:39,345
went out to the truck
to get them.

647
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,120
we sat crossed legged
on the floor...

648
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,843
middle of the afternoon,

649
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:45,757
summer day...

650
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:49,202
trading baseball cards
with the little guy.

651
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:51,403
it was good.

652
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:53,987
you remember this pretty clear
for such a long time ago.

653
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:55,518
yeah, well, you would.

654
00:24:55,518 --> 00:24:57,145
two hours later
it wasn't our file anymore,

655
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:58,676
it was homicide's.

656
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:04,514
that little girl
down by the dock.

657
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:06,141
you remember her?

658
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:09,108
she was turning blue,
she could hardly breathe.

659
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:12,074
you did mouth-to-mouth on her
in the ambulance,

660
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:13,318
all the way to the hospital.

661
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:14,754
buddy,
you saved her life.

662
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:15,998
you stayed with her
the whole time

663
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,051
and then they called
from the hospital...

664
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:19,922
to say "congratulations,
she's gonna live."

665
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:21,070
danny, you got
the silver shield

666
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,984
for that, buddy.

667
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:26,046
proudest friggin' 9 seconds
of my career.

668
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:29,683
'cause then they give you
the punchline...

669
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:32,649
which is something
we don't tell the rookies...

670
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,425
about how the girl
was brain damaged

671
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:36,669
from lack of oxygen.

672
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,296
oh yeah,
she' gonna live...

673
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:41,167
like a vegetable,
shriveling up,

674
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:44,708
until her family decides
to pull the plug

675
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:47,004
to put her out
of her misery.

676
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,153
which i gotta say,

677
00:25:48,153 --> 00:25:50,449
seems to be a good idea
right about now.

678
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,268
danny... danny.

679
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:55,234
i know you're self-esteeming me
like crazy here,

680
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:57,818
but you know what?

681
00:25:57,818 --> 00:25:59,637
that's the last thing
i need right now.

682
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:02,125
that's the last thing.

683
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,230
excuse me.
okay, danny.

684
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,292
all right,
let's take a break.

685
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:08,154
he's almost at the bottom
of that bottle.

686
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:09,876
the more we talk
the faster he drinks.

687
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:11,312
let's just...

688
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:13,130
take a little pressure off,
okay?

689
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,183
boss,
i'm not gonna leave him.

690
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:15,905
all right,
you stay.

691
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:17,819
you stay,
but let him do his thing.

692
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,116
i need to find out
what's going on in that file.

693
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:21,265
okay.

694
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:27,198
we got the homicide file yet?

695
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:28,825
squad car's flying it over.

696
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,069
give you a deadline?

697
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:33,035
yeah, what's left
of his bottle of scotch.

698
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:35,141
harvey,
what do you remember?

699
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:38,108
two victims...
older sister, younger boy.

700
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:40,213
perps got away.

701
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:42,510
tragic as hell,
but it's nothing we don't see.

702
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,754
yeah, but why did this one
get to him?

703
00:26:43,754 --> 00:26:44,806
what was different
about it?

704
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:46,338
did you ever talk
to him about it?

705
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,390
i don't know.
you know how it goes?

706
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,922
i might have asked him
how he was doing?

707
00:26:48,922 --> 00:26:51,697
and what'd he say?

708
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,037
"i'm fine."

709
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:56,099
"i'm fine."

710
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,497
inspector, we're getting ready
to cannon the package here.

711
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,219
no one comes close.

712
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,133
perimeter is locked up.

713
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,478

714
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,349

715
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,498

danny?

00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,474
no surprises.

719
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:37,824
nice and easy.

720
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:49,595
incoming from homicide.

721
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:53,040

724
00:27:57,633 --> 00:27:59,452

726
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:02,992

kidding me.

727
00:28:02,992 --> 00:28:04,619

728
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,213

730
00:28:10,744 --> 00:28:11,701

731
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:14,285
yeah,

732
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:16,199
sam, i need you.

733
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,922
we're gonna open this up.

734
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:22,228
what's happening?

735
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,472
michelle, i need you
to stay out of range.

736
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:24,525
i won't hide in there
anymore.

737
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:26,439
he's my husband.

738
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,640
you know what?
you're right.

739
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,980
you're right,
i want you to come with me,

740
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,128
i want you to hide
behind the shields,

741
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,042
and i want you
to stay close.

742
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,559
all right, we ready?
we ready? sam?

743
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,153
danny, listen to me now.

744
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:47,110
danny, danny,
don't do it.

745
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,971
don't do it!

746
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:49,789
danny, put the gun down!

747
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:51,416
danny,

748
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:52,469
michelle's here.

749
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:53,426
daniel.

750
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:56,105
michelle?

751
00:28:56,105 --> 00:28:57,541
what're you doing?

752
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,263
you can't be here?
get outta here!

753
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:00,316
you shouldn't be here!

754
00:29:00,316 --> 00:29:01,465
i'm not going anywhere,
daniel.

755
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:02,709
get her out of here!

756
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:03,570
i'm not going anywhere!

757
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,771
don't make me do this
in front of her!

758
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:06,919
danny,
just listen to me now.

759
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,216
get her out,
get her out of here!

760
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,365
danny, put that gun down.

761
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:11,704
we're not leaving you,
danny!

762
00:29:11,704 --> 00:29:13,810
we're not leaving you.

763
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,489
come on!

764
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:17,542
in five...

765
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:18,499
four...

766
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:19,456
three...

767
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:20,413
two...

768
00:29:20,413 --> 00:29:21,657
one.

769
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:25,772
fire in the hole.

770
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:34,863
hold fire.
hold fire.

771
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:36,586
daniel! please!

772
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:38,022
michelle,
he's not gonna hurt me.

773
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:39,361
he's not gonna hurt me.
are you, danny?

774
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,797
i'm crossing the line.

775
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:42,041
you think i won't do it?

776
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,285
cardinal rule.

777
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,912
gun's pointed at an officer.

778
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:45,965
hmm?!

779
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,974
sometimes you gotta
break the rules, danny.

780
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:52,281
remember?
remember who taught me that?

781
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:56,300
i'll do it.
i'll do it.

782
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,257
i have the solution.

783
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:59,075
wordy, dammit, go.

784
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,434
hey.

785
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:07,114
hey, hey, hey,
hey-hey.

786
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,932
no-no-no,
it's okay.

787
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,420
it's okay.
it's okay.

788
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,291
you know what you gotta do?

789
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,780
you gotta keep safe.

790
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:20,416
you ever seen this before?

791
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,660
do you have any idea?

792
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,522
no.

793
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:24,435
you gotta hide.

794
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:27,976
it starts here.

795
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,369
i didn't want jeremy
to find it.

796
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:32,570
he told me to stay
under the bed.

797
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,484
so i didn't see them.

798
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:36,302
but do you think
they might'v been the same...

799
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:39,077
the same men
that had come before?

800
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:41,948
don't know why they came back

801
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:44,724
'cause he said we'd be okay.

802
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:47,308
who said you'd be okay,
petra?

803
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:49,987
the policeman
with the baseball cards.

804
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:52,667
he said...
he said we'd be okay.

805
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,538
then he went away.

806
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:58,217
but he didn't know
that they'd come back, petra.

807
00:30:58,217 --> 00:31:01,567
but maybe he did.

808
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:05,108
because...
because he told jeremy.

809
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:08,457
what do you mean
"he told jeremy"?

810
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:11,041
he said,
"you know what you gotta do?

811
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:15,730
you gotta be brave
and show your sisters."

812
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,601
and so jeremy wanted
to be brave

813
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:21,855
so he could save me
and my sister.

814
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:24,822
but it didn't work.

815
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:26,448
it didn't work.

816
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:35,827
boss, we got something.

817
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,124
home invaders came back,

818
00:31:38,124 --> 00:31:39,846
boy stepped up
to protect his sisters,

819
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:40,899
daniel and his team
were done,

820
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,909
daniel didn't do anything
wrong,

821
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:44,153
it was something
he told the boy.

822
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:44,918
yeah. "you know
what you gotta do?

823
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:46,067
you gotta hide."

824
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:47,598
no, that's not what he said.

825
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:50,373
he said,
"you know what you gotta do?

826
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:53,723
you gotta show your sisters
you're brave."

827
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:59,082
what was the boy's name?

828
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:01,666
jeremy.

829
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,814
okay, thanks.

830
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:05,111
you hide, like...

831
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:06,546
daniel?

832
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:10,278
daniel?

833
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:15,638
michelle, you gotta go.

834
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:18,509
you can't see this.

835
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,231
daniel, i'm not leaving you!

836
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:24,346
daniel, let's talk
about jeremy.

837
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:27,600
jeremy?

838
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,131
the file you wanted.

839
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:32,385
guessing it was about jeremy,
right?

840
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:33,820
'cause today's the day.

841
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,022
isn't it?
august 8th?

842
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:40,137
it's funny, those days
that stick in our minds.

843
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:43,295
i'm guessing that jeremy
was a pretty brave kid, but...

844
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,252
i don't know that
for sure,

845
00:32:44,252 --> 00:32:48,367
could you help me out
with that one?

846
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,185
daniel?

847
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:54,300
danny, you can't do this.

848
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,702
you can't do this without...
without telling us why!

849
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:03,870
i know...

850
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:07,602
i know...

851
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:11,717
about a kid...

852
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:15,449
sitting on the floor.

853
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:18,703
i went back.

854
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:21,096
he didn't look any different

855
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:23,680
from the last time i saw him.

856
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,646
his eyes are open,
he's looking at me,

857
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:30,857
baseball cards
spread around him.

858
00:33:30,857 --> 00:33:32,867
but he's real quiet.

859
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:35,068
he's real still,
and i'm thinking,

860
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:41,001
"why is he so still?
why doesn't he say 'hi'?"

861
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:45,116
and then i see it...

862
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:49,423
an eight-inch screwdriver
buried into his throat.

863
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:50,762
and i put it there.

864
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,198
you didn't put it there,
danny.

865
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,633
criminals put it there.

866
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:57,748
if i hadn't been called there,

867
00:33:57,748 --> 00:33:59,280
i wouldn't have said that
to him.

868
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,672
"you gotta be brave
for your sisters."

869
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,352
if it wasn't me,
he, he would've lived.

870
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:07,605
you don't know that,
buddy.

871
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:10,668
danny.

872
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:15,835
i spent my whole career
screwing up.

873
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:19,759
being too late,
being too... early,

874
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:23,013
not saying the right words.

875
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:25,788
i spent my whole career...

876
00:34:25,788 --> 00:34:30,860
looking at the worst 20 minutes
of other people's lives

877
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,583
and i can't take it anymore.

878
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,880
danny, how about remembering
the good stuff?

879
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,315
the good stuff,
all the lives you saved,

880
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:38,133
all the people whose lives
were made better,

881
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:39,282
their lives were made longer

882
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:42,248
because you were there
for those 20 minutes.

883
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,588
i can't remember.
you see?

884
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:47,033
i can't remember.
i can't remember!

885
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:49,713
all i see are the ghosts.

886
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:52,680
all i got are the ghosts,
the ghosts,

887
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,881
and i can't take it any more.

888
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:56,795

00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:16,796

danny, this...

898
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:27,992
this isn't about jeremy.

899
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,481
these guys think
it's all about him,

900
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:32,682
but it's more than that.

901
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:35,266
isn't it?

902
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,180
jeremy's just...

903
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,859
who you always think about.

904
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,582
i get it.

905
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,132
i get it.

906
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:51,439
you know what, buddy?

907
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,405
every time...

908
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:57,946
every time i look out
that damn scope,

909
00:35:57,946 --> 00:36:01,774
i see a kid runnin' across,

910
00:36:01,774 --> 00:36:04,167
i see a spray of blood...

911
00:36:07,516 --> 00:36:11,153
and you know what else,
danny?

912
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:14,885
you know what else i see?

913
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:19,287
all the calls
we didn't get to in time.

914
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:23,689
the mothers that
we couldn't talk down;

915
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:26,177
the kid who thought
it'd be fun to...

916
00:36:26,177 --> 00:36:30,005
pull a gun on a cop.

917
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:34,599
you're not the only one
who sees ghosts, danny.

918
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,173
i gotta tell ya,

919
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:38,044
i don't know where
to put 'em anymore either.

920
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:40,437
eddie, please, no.

921
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:45,126
you taught me
everything i know.

922
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:49,049
you made me who i am,
danny.

923
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:50,676
you can't...

924
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:54,122
you can't tell me...

925
00:36:54,122 --> 00:36:58,045
that this is how it ends.

926
00:36:58,045 --> 00:37:01,299
you can't.
give me the gun.

927
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,404
no...

928
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,476
you'll be okay.

929
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:19,769
stand down.
stand down.

930
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,827
it was harmless.

931
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:34,124
he just wanted
to keep us busy.

932
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:38,717
inspector stainton,

933
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,918
those witnesses
are free to go.

934
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:48,191
hay and grass.

935
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:02,546
i'm gonna take you to a place,

936
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,939
a place i've been myself.

937
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:07,523
and we're gonna get
through this.

938
00:38:07,523 --> 00:38:10,298
