00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:52,413
<i>We're west on the 407.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

176
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,381
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

177
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,482
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i> <i>Most of the patients
here</i> <i>have been diagnosed</i>

178
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,717
with mental illnesses,

179
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:58,018
but Charlie's story
is different.

180
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:59,986
He suffered a frontal lobe
injury at 19.

181
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:02,055
His football helmet
came off during a game,

182
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:03,691
just before he got hit.

183
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:05,826
<i>The football injury</i>
<i>also caused a minor stroke</i>

184
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:07,393
<i>triggering a form of aphasia.</i>

185
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:08,528
Aphasia.

186
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,363
That's a language disorder,
right?

187
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,364
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i> <i>That's right.
It's hard for him</i> <i>to find words,</i>

188
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,465
put them in order.

189
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,200
What about logic and foresight?

190
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,536
Cognitively
he's pretty high functioning.

191
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,604
Frontal lobe damage
can mean a lot of things.

192
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:19,939
Dr. Lavery: For Charlie,
it's impulse-control,

193
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:23,442
mood swings,
bouts of violent aggression.

194
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,109
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>And that's why he's here.</i>

195
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:26,578
<i>A year after his injury</i>
<i>he was involved in a fight,</i>

196
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:27,813
killed a young man.

197
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,648
Ed: - Murder.
Parker: - No. Manslaughter.

198
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:31,350
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>He pled diminished capacity,</i>

199
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,685
but I don't see
a police report.

200
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,920
Ed: Okay, Winnie, contact
the arresting officer.

201
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:37,389
<i>We need more on this.</i>

202
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:38,823
Winnie: - Copy.
<i>Dr. Lavery: - I can tell you</i>

203
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,558
that Charlie's pattern
of aggression continued

204
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,792
once he got here.

205
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,560
There were regular altercations

206
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,261
with the patients,

207
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,730
<i>and recently these outbursts</i>

208
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:47,697
<i>have been getting</i>
<i>more frequent,</i>

209
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:49,733
<i>and more violent.</i>

210
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:54,671
(Computer beeps)

211
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:55,472
Spike: Boss, you're gonna
wanna take a look at this.

212
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,274
Be right there, Spike.

213
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:02,245
What do you have, Spike?

214
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:03,479
Well, he's definitely
high-functioning.

215
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,980
Watch.

216
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,948
Charlie approaches Nestor,
tries to provoke him...

217
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:08,417
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i>
<i>And then Nestor stabs him.</i>

218
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:09,518
<i>That's what the witnesses</i>
<i>have described.</i>

219
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:10,619
Except that's not
what happened.

220
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:14,723
Charlie cut himself?

221
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:16,759
To get to the infirmary.

222
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:18,093
Grabs a hostage with car keys.

223
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,227
All eyes on Nestor,
he makes his move.

224
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,496
<i>Team one, listen up,</i>

225
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:22,797
this may be
a premeditated escape.

226
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,665
<i>Charlie may be</i>
<i>working out a plan here,</i>

227
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,233
<i>and we've gotta find him</i>
<i>before something triggers him</i>

228
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,135
<i>and he loses control.</i>

Yeah.

234

(Phone ringing)

243
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:01,659
No.

You've got your freedom?
Yeah, I know.

246
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,436
You do now, Charlie,
but what happens next?

247
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:14,570
Hmm?

248
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:16,873
I stay that way.

249
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,742
(Gas gauge dings)

250
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:24,246
Charlie:
Stop at gas station.

251
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:25,981
I don't have money, Charlie.

252
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:27,784
I left my purse.

253
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:29,786
(Phone ringing)

254
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:38,193
No answer on Manley's phone.

<i>Winnie:</i>
<i>Boss, I've got Officer Carlyle.</i>

256
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:41,963
He was first on scene
when Charlie was arrested.

257
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:43,732
Okay, patch him through,
Winnie.

258
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,266
<i>Carlyle:</i>
<i>It's Carlyle here.</i>

259
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,968
You're looking for background
on a Charlie Alanak?

260
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:48,970
Parker: Hey, officer.
The subject's at large,

261
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:51,272
but our profile's
a little spotty.

262
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,607
<i>Hoping you can shed some light</i>
<i>on his crime.</i>

263
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:55,409
Yeah, of course.

264
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:57,778
A call came in late,
Kempton campus.

265
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:59,146
Victim was 19, 20,

266
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:00,748
same age as Alanak.

267
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,550
<i>There was a verbal exchange</i>
<i>and some taunting.</i>

268
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:03,951
They fought.

269
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:05,653
Alanak pushed the kid
off the football stands.

270
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:07,087
He hit his head and he died.

271
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:08,254
Schoolyard brawl,

272
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:09,823
two lives changed forever.

273
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,890
<i>Carlyle:</i>
<i>Alanak confessed.</i>

274
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,892
Witnesses corroborated.

275
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,293
Case closed.

276
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:15,995
You know if he and the victim
had a history?

277
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,530
<i>Carlyle:</i>
<i>No. No indication of that.</i>

278
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:19,432
By all accounts
he just snapped.

279
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,267
I will tell you what I remember
the most, sergeant.

280
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:22,268
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

281
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:24,269
That look in his eye.

<i>And Alanak?</i>

288
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,385
Dead calm.

289
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:43,588
Okay. Thanks, officer.
Thanks for your time.

347
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:25,861
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.

348
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,595
Ed: Winnie, let's get Charlie's
photo and description.

349
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,832
Full media alert,
he's armed and dangerous.

350
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,066
Will do.

351
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,167
<i>Parker: - Team.</i>
<i>Ed: - Go, boss.</i>

352
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,102
Charlie's on
a cocktail of meds:

353
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,103
<i>Lithium, methylphenidate...</i>
<i>It goes on.</i>

354
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,538
Mood stabilizers.

355
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,273
Yeah, and the longer
he goes without 'em...

356
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:40,574
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>The worse our day's gonna get.</i>

357
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:41,775
Doctor, I need a list

358
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,144
of Charlie's friends
and family,

359
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:45,679
anyone who so much as sent him
a get-well card.

360
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,315
- I'll get the visitor log.
- Thank you.

361
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:49,116
Okay, Eddie,
I can tell you this,

362
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,417
<i>no brothers or sisters.</i>

363
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:51,885
His father died
when he was young.

364
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,854
Just a mom, Katia Alanak.

365
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:55,088
Okay, boss, on our way.

366
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:56,356
- Sam...
- We'll finish up here.

367
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,859
Spike, you're with me.
Let's move.

368
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:05,431
<i>Dr. Lavery: (Recording)</i> <i>Charlie, I wanna
talk about</i> <i>you understanding your actions.</i>

369
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:08,133
Talking...

370
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:12,037
Doesn't help.

371
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,741
<i>I'm still...</i>

372
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,012
Trapped.

373
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,583
I'm still trapped here!

374
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,752
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i>
<i>Yes, Charlie, you are.</i>

375
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,720
<i>You are here,</i>
<i>but you need to...</i>

376
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,591
I printed off the names
of all the visitors.

377
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,393
There's twelve in total.

378
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,928
<i>Pretty standard pattern.</i>

379
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,829
<i>Regular visits</i>
<i>in the first couple months,</i>

380
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,163
classmates, friends,

381
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:42,165
<i>and then they taper off.</i>

382
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:43,633
<i>Most of the names</i> <i>on this list</i>

383
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:44,902
<i>haven't been here</i>
<i>in a couple of years.</i>

384
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:46,937
Once they realize
conditions like Charlie's

385
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,738
is a lifetime's work...

386
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:50,507
People move on.

387
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:53,010
Okay, team, I'm sending you
a list of 12 names.

388
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:54,711
<i>Let's cross 'em off.</i>

389
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:55,912
<i>Spike:</i> <i>Boss, any old
teammates</i> <i>on that list?</i>

390
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,013
Coaches? Trainers?

391
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,847
What're you thinking, Spike?

392
00:16:58,916 --> 00:16:59,882
<i>Spike:</i> <i>Well, Charlie used
to play</i> <i>football, right?</i>

393
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,350
Those can be strong bonds.

394
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:02,818
That's better.
Doctor?

395
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:04,420
Any of these football buddies?

396
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:06,488
Yeah. Don Colby
and Kevin Baines.

397
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:07,623
<i>They were on</i>
<i>his university team.</i>

398
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,724
Parker:
Let's start there.

399
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,293
Don Colby, Kevin Baines.

400
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,193
<i>We'll send unis</i>
<i>to cover the rest.</i>

401
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:14,062
(Siren wails)

402
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,463
Sam:
Thanks.

403
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:17,365
No answer at Don Colby's.
I'm heading over there.

404
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,634
Okay, I'll try Kevin Baines.

405
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:22,170
I'll catch up with you
when I'm done.

406
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,371
(Phone rings)

407
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,543
Kevin: - Hello.
<i>Sam: - Kevin Baines?</i>

408
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,777
Kevin:
Yes.

409
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,012
<i>Sam:</i>
<i>This is Sam Braddock</i>

410
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,213
<i>from the Police</i>
<i>Strategic Response Unit.</i>

411
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,848
I'm calling you
about Charlie Alanak.

412
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,650
<i>He escaped from his facility</i>
<i>today.</i>

413
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:38,419
You think he's coming here?

414
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:39,719
<i>Sam:</i> <i>This is just</i>
<i>a precautionary call, sir,</i>

415
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:41,621
I don't wanna alarm you,
but I have to tell you...

416
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,424
Charlie's considered armed
and dangerous.

417
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:45,358
Armed?

418
00:17:45,426 --> 00:17:46,792
<i>Sam:</i> <i>So if he tries to make
contact</i> <i>with you in any way,</i>

419
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,527
call the police immediately,
okay?

420
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:49,862
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I will.

421
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,965
Thanks for the call.

422
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,532
(Phone beeps off)

423
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:55,368
Oh gee...

424
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:57,036
Guess who?

425
00:17:57,104 --> 00:17:59,072
Uh... is it Lady Gaga?

426
00:17:59,139 --> 00:17:59,839
No!

427
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:01,073
Oh, it's Nicky!

428
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:06,911
You all right?

429
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,447
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,649
Hey, the moving trucks
don't get here for a bit.

431
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,751
You wanna get outta this mess.

432
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,487
Sure.
That'd be great.

433
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:18,456
- Okay.
- I'll go get the stuff.

434
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,095
(Banging on door)
Police! Open up, please!

435
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:26,097
<i>(Door crashes open nearby)</i>

436
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:33,769
Hey!

437
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,438
Stop! Right there!

438
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:45,448
Don Colby?

439
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:46,516
Yeah.
What's this all about?

440
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,017
What're you running for, don?

441
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,318
Oh, let me guess.
It's medical, right,

442
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,553
and you're just filling
out the paperwork?

443
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:52,854
Yeah, something like that.

444
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,423
Yeah, well, I'm here
because a patient escaped

445
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:55,624
from Meadowview complex today.

446
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:57,659
We need to know
if he's contacted you.

447
00:18:57,727 --> 00:18:58,793
Charlie Alanak.

448
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,762
Wait.
Charlie busted out?

449
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,564
You haven't heard from him?

450
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:03,598
No.

451
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,467
No.
Not for a couple years.

452
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:10,638
(Truck rumbles)

453
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:38,697
Doctor, Charlie's crime,
I can't find a sentence.

454
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,699
That's because Meadowview
isn't a prison.

455
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,334
<i>Sentences aren't preset.</i>

456
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:43,769
When Charlie arrived,
we had reason to believe

457
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:46,105
he'd only be with us
a couple years.

458
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:47,339
What happened?

459
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:48,707
Well, we can't start
the release process

460
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:50,809
until we're absolutely sure
he doesn't pose a danger.

461
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:54,279
Based on today,
he's got a ways to go.

462
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:56,581
Here, let me show you
something.

463
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,716
(Car doors close)

464
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:01,152
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Katia Alanak?</i>

465
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,554
Yes?

466
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:03,921
Hi. Officer Lane.
This is Officer Scarlatti.

467
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:05,256
We were hoping
you could help us.

468
00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:07,092
Of course.

469
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,025
Have you seen your son today?

470
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:10,827
I think there's been a mistake.

471
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,262
My son's in a facility.

472
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,833
Your son escaped
from Meadowview, ma'am.

473
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:21,638
<i>Dr. Lavery;</i> <i>How did
it start,</i> <i>Charlie?</i>

474
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:23,407
I didn't... start it!

475
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:25,841
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i> <i>Well, it takes
two to fight,</i> <i>Charlie,</i>

476
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:27,776
<i>and when you respond</i>
<i>impulsively,</i>

477
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,479
<i>that's where</i>
<i>the trouble starts.</i>

478
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:31,314
<i>That's what got you here</i>
<i>in the first place, remember?</i>

479
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,948
No.

480
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:35,518
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i> <i>Yes, Charlie
,</i> <i>and you know it.</i>

481
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,122
<i>You lost control that night</i>
<i>and a young man died.</i>

482
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:44,993
I made... a choice.

483
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,497
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i>
<i>What're you saying, Charlie?</i>

484
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:49,664
I had to.

485
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:54,102
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i>
<i>Had to kill him?</i>

486
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,537
<i>Answer me, Charlie.</i>

487
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:56,970
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>you did it on purpose?</i>

488
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,275
No more.

489
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:03,477
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i>
<i>That was two months ago.</i>

490
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,279
It's a discouraging change

491
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,515
from someone who showed remorse
<i>about a moment of impulse,</i>

492
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:10,384
to this, unfeeling, combative,

493
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:12,452
confused about his own
state of mind.

494
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,621
Man on a fast-track
out of here.

495
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:16,055
A week ago it got worse.

496
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:18,057
Charlie shut down altogether.

497
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,992
No change in his health?
His meds?

498
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,828
<i>Dr. Lavery:</i>
<i>No, not at all.</i>

499
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,169
You know what I remember most

500
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:32,037
about when Charlie was healthy?

501
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:33,738
What's that,
Mrs. Alanak?

502
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:35,274
The noise.

503
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:36,741
(Low hum of chatter)

504
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,778
<i>Katia:</i>
<i>The boys and the commotion.</i>

505
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,746
(Chatter and laughter)

506
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:48,852
<i>Katia:</i> <i>After the accident
,</i> <i>life just got so quiet.</i>

507
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:52,255
<i>It was easier for him</i>
<i>not to talk.</i>

508
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:54,558
<i>It was embarrassing.</i>

509
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:59,629
Charlie's friends stopped
coming by after that?

510
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:01,231
Kevin didn't.

511
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:02,700
Even when Charlie
was in trouble,

512
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:04,201
Kevin was there.

513
00:22:04,268 --> 00:22:05,569
His family found us a lawyer,

514
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:08,304
and helped pay
for the legal costs.

515
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:10,106
I don't know what Charlie
would do without him.

516
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:11,540
What do you mean by that?

517
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:13,676
Kevin took a job out west.

518
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:15,178
- He's leaving?
- Mm-hm.

519
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:16,979
Mrs. Alanak,
when is he leaving?

520
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:18,948
I wrote it down.

521
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:22,618
Today.

522
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,054
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Boss, we got something here.</i>

523
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:27,488
Yeah, go ahead, Eddie.

524
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,357
Ed: Charlie's closest
friend is Kevin Baines.

525
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:31,626
Yeah, he's in the logs.
He visits regularly.

526
00:22:31,694 --> 00:22:34,129
Yeah, well, not any more.
He's moving away, today.

527
00:22:35,198 --> 00:22:37,866
So, loss of a best friend;
That's a huge blow.

528
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,601
Especially for someone
in Charlie's position.

529
00:22:39,668 --> 00:22:40,768
Okay, Eddie,
you stay with the mom,

530
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:41,869
I'm on it.

531
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:46,941
Kevin:
Suz, let's go.

532
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:48,509
<i>Suzanne:</i>
<i>Just a second.</i>

533
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:49,711
Charlie:
(Unintelligible stammer)

534
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:51,613
Charlie.

535
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,081
Man, look at you.
Are you all right?

536
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:55,850
Um... um...

537
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:59,986
(Stammering)
I got... got...

538
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:02,922
Escaped.

539
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,691
I know, Charlie.
The police are after you.

540
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,127
Mm-mm. Uh...
(Murmurs)

541
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,863
I need...

542
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,097
Look, this isn't a good place
for you to be, buddy. Okay?

543
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:12,798
They already called here.

544
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:15,401
Tell you what.

545
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:16,636
Why don't you go
to my cottage, okay?

546
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:17,470
Do you have some way
of getting around?

547
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:19,071
No. Kevin...

548
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:27,446
You can't abandon me.

549
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,952
Look, I...
I, uh...

550
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,689
Charlie, I don't know
what to say.

551
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:39,857
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>
<i>We fly tonight.</i>

552
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,626
You said...
You sa...

553
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:43,561
Stick by me!

554
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:46,363
- And I will, Charlie...
- You promised!

555
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,098
Suzanne:
All shoed up?

556
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:51,735
Kevin: - Wait, Suz.
Suzanne: - Let's hit the road.

557
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:53,069
Kevin:
Um...

558
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:56,239
<i>Suz, I told you</i>
<i>about my old friend.</i>

559
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:57,441
Charlie Alanak.

560
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,443
Hi.

562
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:06,148
- Don't.
- I gotta take this, Charlie.

563
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:07,750
It's... police.

564
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:08,984
Kevin: Now, we've got a
thousand things going on.

565
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,453
I'm gonna answer my phone,
okay?

566
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:11,721
Whoa, whoa, Charlie!
Charlie!

00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:21,237
Don't answer!

00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:28,477
Charlie: - No.
Kevin: - Charlie,

573
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:29,712
you're scaring my family.

574
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:33,049
Okay, you're scaring my boy.

575
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:38,753
Okay...

576
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:40,755
<i>Charlie:</i>
<i>Then... we drive!</i>

577
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:42,123
<i>Kevin:</i>
<i>Okay, we can do that.</i>

578
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:45,460
Just me and you, the two of us.

579
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,928
To Robbie.

580
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,630
Robbie?

581
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,867
You think that's
a good idea, Charlie?

582
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:53,167
Kevin: - Okay!
Charlie: - Now!

583
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:54,301
Okay.

Honey, go inside.

<i>from the Baines house.</i>

588
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,085
Charlie was there.
Officer's on his way

589
00:25:12,152 --> 00:25:14,287
and I got Suzanne Baines
on the line.

590
00:25:14,355 --> 00:25:16,422
Suzanne, hi.
My name is Sergeant Greg Parker.

591
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,623
<i>Suzanne:</i>
<i>He took Kevin.</i>

592
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:19,058
He has a gun.

593
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,894
A police officer is heading
to you now, ma'am.

594
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,061
You're safe.

595
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,263
His name's Charlie Alanak.

596
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,663
Kevin knows him from school.

597
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,898
Parker:
Okay, okay.

598
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:27,065
Do you know
where they were going?

599
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:28,767
Suzanne:
No. Well, yes...

600
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:30,936
To see someone...
Someone named Robbie.

<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Do you know who that is?</i>

602
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:33,171
No idea.

603
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,839
<i>Why did he come here?</i>

604
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,141
<i>Parker:</i> <i>I'm trying to
figure that out,</i> <i>ma'am.</i>

606
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:39,044
You just stay inside.

<i>Suzanne:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

608
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:43,948
Mrs. Alanak, does Charlie know
somebody named Robbie?

609
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:45,983
Robbie's not a person.

610
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:52,256
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Boss, Tom Robbarts field.
</i> <i>Kempton University.</i>

611
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:53,690
The scene of the crime.

612
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,793
- Let's move.
- Mr. Lane?

613
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,560
- Please.
- Ma'am, we're gonna do everything we can.

614
00:25:57,628 --> 00:25:59,762

(Sirens wail)

616
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:05,701
Parker: Okay, team, why does
he go back to ground zero?

617
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,037
Maybe he wants to face
his ghosts.

618
00:26:07,104 --> 00:26:08,171
Some kind of atonement.

619
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:10,840
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Charlie's assault,</i>

620
00:26:10,908 --> 00:26:12,409
he snapped, pushed that kid
to his death,

621
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:13,909
it was an impulse.

622
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:16,412
Charlie talked about making
a choice that day...

623
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,080
There's something
we're missing here.

624
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:19,415
<i>Sam:</i> <i>Hey, boss,</i>
<i>I'm here with Raf now.</i>

625
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:21,417

that don witnessed it.

626
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:22,617
Okay, bring him, Sam.

627
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:23,752
We need to get inside
this thing.

628
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,454

Don, we're gonna need
your help on this, okay?

Oh man.

632
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:33,127

this through, buddy.

00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:34,996
I mean...

634
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:36,764
What're we doing here, Charlie?

635
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:38,232
This is not a good plan.

636
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Charlie:
I had to.

637
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:40,668
You broke out, Charlie.
Okay?

638
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:41,702
The cops are chasing you.

639
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,837
I had to!

640
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:44,238
Okay, listen to me,
listen to me.

641
00:26:44,306 --> 00:26:45,405
You're only making this worse
for yourself.

642
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,807
Okay?
It's gotta be easier...

643
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:51,478
Team one, just got a 911 call
from Kevin Baines' phone.

644
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:53,847
The line's open,
but I can barely hear anything.

645
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:55,949
Covert call.
Kevin's in trouble.

646
00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:58,485
You gotta hear me on this,
you're being rash.

647
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:00,120
Talk... to you.

648
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,554

Don, Charlie's assault,

651
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,066
did he intend to hurt that kid?

652
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,634
Look, am I being arrested here
or what?

653
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:16,735
Answer the question.

654
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,706
No. He barely knew him.

655
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,774
It was...
It was just some kid

656
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,276
who didn't know
when to shut his mouth.

657

<i>He provoked Charlie.</i>

Take me through it, don.

660
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,317
Through what?

661
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,851
I gave my statement
a thousand times.

662
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,686
You should have no problem
getting up for one more.

663
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,825
It was late.

664
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,630

00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:02,333
Uh, wait up.

694
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:04,102
<i>Guy:</i>
<i>Way to kill a party.</i>

695
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:05,737
<i>You're such a loser!</i>

696
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,773
Freak.

697
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:10,508
Guy: Freak! Look at you!
Learn to talk!

698
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:12,644
Kevin: Hey, just stop.
Look at me! Hey! Let it go!

699
00:29:12,712 --> 00:29:14,946
<i>Guy:</i> <i>Get your freak ass</i>
<i>back to rehab, dogface...</i>

700
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,413
Kevin:
Just let it go.

701
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:19,549
Next thing I know
we hear shouting.

702
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:23,186
I ran back
but it was already over.

703
00:29:30,328 --> 00:29:31,661
(Shrill shriek)

704
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,970
Cracked the kid's skull
wide open.

705
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,780
Spike:
There they are.

706
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:53,282
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Let's use the
stands</i> <i>for cover.</i>

707
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,384
(Siren wails)

708
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:00,722
So you didn't actually see
Charlie beat that kid.

709
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,424
Like I said,
by the time I ran back...

710
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:03,959
It was over, right.

711
00:30:04,027 --> 00:30:05,193
So, in fact, the whole thing

712
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:05,960
could've gone down
some other way.

713
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:07,595
You wouldn't know.

714
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:09,631
<i>Don:</i> <i>Charlie confessed.
</i> <i>Kevin agreed!</i>

715
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:12,600
The cops, the judges,
they all agreed, man.

716
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:13,968
And you?

717
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:16,804
Don, two of your friends
are in a world of trouble

718
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:18,706
right now.

719
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:19,874
If you know anything
that might help,

720
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,441
now is the time.

721
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,610
Okay, look,

722
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:26,446
I stand by everything I said,
all right?

723
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:29,749
<i>But you step into a thing</i>
<i>like that,</i>

724
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:31,951
you get a feeling, like...

725
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:33,187
Like a flash.

726
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:38,090
<i>There was something</i>
<i>in their eyes,</i>

727
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:39,892
<i>a look.</i>

728
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:40,893
Something between them.

729
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,161
A secret.

730
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:43,829
I don't know.

731
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:44,664
Sam: Don, are you saying
Kevin could've been the one?

732
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:45,764
Those are your words.

733
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:48,234
But it's crossed your mind.

734
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,438
I don't know.

735
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:55,640
It...
It was a feeling.

736
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,643
(Stammers) It was a feeling,
that's all.

737
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:03,315
(Sirens wail, tires screech)

738
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,652
This lines up, Sam.

739
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,421
I think this is what Charlie
was trying to say.

740
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:12,122
<i>It was Kevin</i>
<i>who pushed that kid</i>

741
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,058
and he made a choice
to take the fall for Kevin.

742
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:17,728
Sam: Don, you think Charlie
would've taken the fall for Kevin,

743
00:31:17,795 --> 00:31:19,896
<i>wear that for him</i>
<i>all these years?</i>

744
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:21,465
I mean, Kevin was your leader,
your best friend.

745
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,466
You looked up to him.

746
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:23,800
And Charlie?

747
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:32,142
Charlie just wanted to be
on the team again.

748
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,177
Okay, team, we gotta treat this
as a real possibility.

749
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:36,546
Charlie might've confessed
to protect his friend...

750
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:37,814
Until he can't take it anymore.

751
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:39,549
<i>He tells Kevin</i> <i>to come clean.</i>

752
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:41,183
<i>That's when Kevin tells him</i>
<i>"sorry, buddy,</i>

753
00:31:41,251 --> 00:31:42,918
<i>I can't help you,</i>
<i>I'm moving on."</i>

754
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,555
Then he busts out
to make one last appeal.

755
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:49,558
Charlie?

756
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:50,926
Charlie:
No!

757
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,494
Parker:
I need you to stay calm.

758
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:53,729
Don't come near!

759
00:31:53,797 --> 00:31:55,831
Charlie, listen to him!

760
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:57,298
Charlie! Okay...

761
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,369
Okay, okay.
Whoa. Just let me go!

762
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:03,204
(Gunshot pops)
Charlie: Keep away!

763
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:04,605
Okay...
(Panting)

764
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:07,308
Talk... to them!

765
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:09,010
Or what, Charlie?

766
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:11,212
I do...
What I have to.

767
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:14,314
Eddie, he points that gun...

768
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:15,448
Ed:
I know.

769
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:20,087
I got the solution.

770
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:24,311
(Sirens wail)

771
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:32,086
Charlie?
My name's Greg Parker.

772
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:33,454
I'm gonna cut to the chase,
buddy,

773
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:36,223
'cause I know
you deserve the truth

774
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:39,092
and you're smart enough
to handle it.

775
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,494
<i>But if you point</i> <i>that gun,</i>

776
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:44,698
my team will have no choice
but to shoot you.

777
00:32:44,765 --> 00:32:47,133
Sam, they move,
I lose my line of fire.

778
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:48,401
Cross me, north angle.

779
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:49,669
Sam:
Copy.

780
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,137
Parker:
Spike, I need ears in there.

781
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:52,138
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Raf, cover him.</i>

782
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,272
Copy.

783
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,411
You here with me, buddy?

784
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:05,150
<i>Charlie, I need to see you</i>
<i>put that gun down.</i>

785
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:08,053
I'm...
Not going back!

786
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,691
Charlie,
they will shoot you, okay?

787
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,660
They will shoot you
where you stand.

788
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:16,861
<i>Parker:</i>
<i>Kevin, please,</i>

789
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,596
I just need to talk
to Charlie right now.

790
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:19,597
Will you let me do that?

791
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,899
Kevin:
So talk!

792
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:23,635
Make him understand!
He threatened my family!

793
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,136
He waved a gun
in front of my son!

794
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,703
Kevin, please.

795
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,739
Kevin: Look, Charlie,
what you want from me,

796
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,173
I can't give you.

797
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,009
(Murmurs, fuming) No!

798
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,510
Kevin:
Look, it's too late.

799
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,746
It's to late, okay?
I wish that weren't the case.

800
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,082
(Sighs, frustrated)
Spike, status.

801
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:41,851
Spike: Here it comes.
(Device beeps)

802
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,021
Charlie: (Breathing hard) No...

803
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:47,089
- We...
- My son, my wife,

804
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:50,693
you're asking me
to throw that away.

805
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:53,095
- It's time!
- Time to what?

806
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:54,597
To throw away
three healthy lives

807
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,066
for one broken one?

808
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:58,499
No! Stop!

809
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:02,771
You... you...
I... the...

810
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:05,173
<i>It's time!</i>
<i>You promised!</i>

811
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,709
Kevin: Okay, okay,
okay, just calm down.

812
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:09,243
Eddie, Charlie doesn't wanna
hear us right now,

813
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:11,112
but he needs a voice.

814
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,246
You want me to take this?

815
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,114
Yeah, I want you
to talk to Kevin,

816
00:34:13,182 --> 00:34:14,648
leader to leader.

817
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:16,750
He was their quarterback,
so tap into that.

818
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:18,485
Copy. Sam?

819
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:19,987
I have the solution.

820
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:21,455
Charlie:
(Pants)

821
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:24,959
Ed:
Charlie Alanak,

822
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,660
my name's Ed Lane.

823
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:30,296
I need to speak to Kevin.
Is that all right?

824
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:31,664
He's the one with the gun,
okay?

825
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:33,466
Just get me outta here!

826
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:34,934
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Kevin, we all want that.</i>

827
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:36,569
We just gotta work
together here, okay?

828
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:38,037
Kevin: All that I've
done for him and he...

829
00:34:38,105 --> 00:34:39,739
He threatens my family,

830
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,540
drags me here at gunpoint.

831
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:43,610
I stood by him like a brother!

832
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:45,478
<i>Ed:</i> <i>I know that, Kevin.
</i> <i>You've been good to Charlie.</i>

833
00:34:45,545 --> 00:34:48,914
<i>Kevin:</i> <i>Everyone wrote
him off,</i> <i>but not me.</i>

834
00:34:48,982 --> 00:34:50,448
Tell him!

835
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:52,183
Kevin: Our own coach
turned against him.

836
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:53,985
<i>Told me</i> <i>he was a distraction,</i>

837
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,520
told me to move on.

838
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:56,787
You know what I told him?

839
00:34:56,855 --> 00:34:58,623
You remember, Charlie?

840
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,857
I told him I'd quit the team

841
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,092
if your name came off
your locker.

842
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,261
- Didn't I? Didn't I?
- Tell him.

843
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:04,362
Yes.

844
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,565
Tell him.

845
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,034
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>Okay, Kevin, I get it.</i>

846
00:35:12,003 --> 00:35:14,404
You stood up for Charlie.

847
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:16,640
That's what happened
in the stands that night;

848
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:19,075
somebody came at him,
you defended him.

849
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:20,511
<i>You were the team leader,</i>
<i>Kevin,</i>

850
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,012
<i>you had his back,</i>
<i>he was your friend.</i>

851
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:25,214
Only this time
something went wrong,

852
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:26,949
and suddenly your whole world
is in the balance,

853
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:28,884
<i>your career,</i>
<i>your scholarship, all of it.</i>

854
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:31,521
No, no, no,
you got that wrong, okay?

855
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:35,491
Charlie saw that,
he knew what was at stake.

856
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,728
He saw your future, his...

857
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:44,732
And he made a choice
and he took the hit.

858
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:47,802
Kevin: No, look, if he's
saying that, he's lying.

859
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,870
Mm-mm!

860
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:49,871
It's your word against mine!

861
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,540
I didn't!

862
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,474
<i>Ed:</i> <i>Kevin, listen to me.
</i> <i>Listen to me.</i>

863
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:54,842
Charlie never said anything.

864
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,578
<i>All these years,</i> <i>he kept quiet.</i>

865
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,248
Think about what that cost him.

866
00:36:02,884 --> 00:36:05,919
Charlie,
tell him why you did it.

867
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:17,230
You're my friend.

868
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,837
<i>Ed:</i>
<i>He's your friend.</i>

869
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:27,773
It's as simple as that;
He's your friend.

870
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:30,409
Kevin, you know Charlie better
than anybody else.

871
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:31,510
<i>You stood on the field</i>
<i>with him,</i>

872
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:33,579
<i>you grew up together.</i>

873
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:35,414
<i>Charlie knows what it is</i>
<i>to be a friend.</i>

874
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:37,148
<i>He proved it.</i>

875
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:40,586
<i>For five years, Kevin,</i>
<i>he proved it.</i>

876
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:42,821
It's your turn.

877
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:46,857
<i>He deserves to live a life.</i>

878
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:49,227
<i>He deserves to be able to have</i>
<i>the same hopes and dreams</i>

879
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,628
<i>as the rest of us,</i> <i>Kevin.</i>

880
00:36:50,696 --> 00:36:52,830
To be able to hold his head up
to the world.

881
00:36:52,897 --> 00:36:55,899
Now you gotta give him
that chance.

882
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:04,274
Please.

883
00:37:06,544 --> 00:37:08,278
I...

884
00:37:08,346 --> 00:37:11,248
Wasn't supposed to be
like this, Charlie.

885
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:12,716
So many times
I wanted to make it right

886
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:13,950
and then I...

887
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:16,652
I look at my wife, my son,

888
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,819
and I... (Sighs)

889
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:21,089
I'm sorry, Charlie.

890
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,225
I'm so, so sorry.

891
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,233
I know,

892
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:39,374
but that's not what I need.

893
00:37:57,392 --> 00:37:58,458
I did it.

894
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:02,462
I pushed that kid.

895
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:06,832
I killed him.

896
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,488
If there's anything else,
I'll let you know.

897
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,993
Hey.

898
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:39,062
Oh...

899
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:46,337
Thank you.

900
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,473

901
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,142

No, no.

910

But he was innocent,

911
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,970

a strong moral code

You don't need to worry.

You know why?
You used to say that

929

when you had a date
with a bottle of scotch.

930
00:39:58,137 --> 00:40:01,039

I'll file the report.
