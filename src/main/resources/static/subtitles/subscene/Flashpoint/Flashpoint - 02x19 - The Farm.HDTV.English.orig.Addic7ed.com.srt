1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,220
Move in now.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,220
Sarge,can't see any movement.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,730
door's jammed from the inse.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,180
Spike,any other way in?

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,030
Negative.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,840
Wordy,hurry,we need the umbrella!

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,260
We gotta get in there!

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,550
Everyone inside the barn,stand back from the doors!

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,740
Stay back!

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,120
*****

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,570
You gotta pay inside,first.

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,330
what?

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,370
No one trusts anyone anymore.

14
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,530
You okay?

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,140
Yeah,i'm fine.

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,630
There you go.Have a great day.

17
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,200
How're you doing?Can i help you find something?

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,730
I need some money.

19
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,660
Okay,the atm is just in the back.

20
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,210
Please,just give me the money.

21
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,390
That's it.

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,590
This is all you have?

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,370
We don't usually keep a lot of money in the register.

24
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,550
Well,this isn't enough.I need more.

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,530
Don't these places have some kind of safe?

26
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,410
Yes,but this is my second day.I don't know how to open it.

27
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,500
keep your hands up.

28
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,770
Keep your hands up.Stay quiet.

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,190
can we please have one?

30
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,000
Nope.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,230
please,mom?

32
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,620
Stay where you are!

33
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,880
Oh please,don't...Please don't hurt us!

34
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,700
Okay,give me your purse.

35
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,740
Take it,take it.Just take it.

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,370
Take it,take it.Take it.

37
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,440
You move!Go stand next to her!

38
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,700
Keep your hands up where i can see them!

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,090
It's okay.

40
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,450
Your car,does it have gas in it?

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,680
Yes,yeah.I just filled it up.It's yours!

42
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,990
okay,that's good.

43
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,460
No,you're gonna come with me.

44
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,740
- Oh god,no!
- come here.

45
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,560
Okay,okay.Just...

46
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,340
mommy!

47
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,080
It's okay,baby.It's okay.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,780
stay there.Stay there!

49
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,560
Go slow.

50
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,500
wait,wait,wait,wait!

51
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,370
No!No!

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,890
Go back!Go back!

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,620
All right!All right!

54
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,800
stay there!Keep your hands up!

55
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,100
No!No,i can't let them take me!

56
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,310
It's okay,honey,it's okay.

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,160
It's gonna be okay,baby.We're all right.

58
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,530
Stay quiet!

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,920
You break that bag,they don't give us another one.

60
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,810
You know what?I'm just a little frustrated.

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,910
Clark's beating me up.He wants to go to a party.

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,880
I won't let him go.It's just a hassle.

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
What's the big deal?

64
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,310
I'll tell you what the big deal is: there's no parental supervision.

65
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,570
Ah,parents away,kid takes advantage?

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,610
You telling me you never went to a party like that when you were clark's age?

67
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,930
Why do you think i don't want him to go?

68
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,870
No offence,ed,but your kid plays the cello.

69
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,520
I don't know how much trouble he's really gonna get into.

70
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,350
Funny.Funny stuff.

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,470
Team one,hot call!

72
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,530
Hostage situation!

73
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,200
Gas station.528 brock road!

74
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,020
All right,leah,wordy,cover the exits.

75
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,530
We need a hard perimeter on this.

76
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,420
- copy that.
- copy that.

77
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,370
Sam,let me know how many hostages we got in there.

78
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,570
We might be able to get a snake cam in through the garage.

79
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,450
I'm on it.

80
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,780
Okay,spike,get the truck.

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,830
Copy that.

82
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,960
How many subjects did you say?

83
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,250
just one.A woman.

84
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,020
At least one hostage.Maybe more.

85
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,360
You have any contact with her?

86
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,110
she started screaming at us to go away,waving the gun around.

87
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,960
Seems unstable.

88
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,480
Who called 911?

89
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,340
Okay,thanks a lot.Let's go,jules.

90
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,620
Hello,sir.

91
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,860
You call 911?

92
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,770
Yes,sir,i did.

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,980
What did she seem like when you talked to her?

94
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,010
Oh,she was scared.Kind of jumpy.

95
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,260
Which car was her's?

96
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,260
The red one.

97
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,330
Please,stay right there.

98
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,180
Eddie,we're coming in.

99
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,140
Looks like the plates have expired.

100
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,310
Yeah,like um...15 years ago.

101
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,050
Spike,i need you to run some plates.

102
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,350
Tango-3-Uniform...Zulu-Niner-Seven-Niner.

103
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,570
Copy that.

104
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,170
She can't get out this way.

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
Rear door secure.

106
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,860
damn it!They're everywhere!

107
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,100
Isn't there any other way out?

108
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,600
Gas station attendant: no.

109
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,710
If you just give yourself up...

110
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,330
I'm talking to the lady in the store who's in charge right now.

111
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,900
This is the police strategic response unit.

112
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll be calling the store phone shortly.I need you to pick it up.

113
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,070
Go away!

114
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,000
How're you doing?

115
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,720
My name is greg parker.Can you tell me your name?

116
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,910
Can you tell me how many people you have in there with you?

117
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,280
Three.

118
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,920
That's good.

119
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,600
How are they?Are they okay?

120
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,140
Yes.

121
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,010
I'm glad to hear that.

122
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,740
Now,i wanna make sure that everyone in there comes out safely,

123
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,730
and that includes you.

124
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,590
Then stay away and let me go!

125
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,090
Well,i just want to help you.

126
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,380
you're a cop.

127
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,280
That's right.

128
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,280
so tell me why i should trust you!

129
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,610
Hey,spike,you run those plates yet?

130
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,440
Car is registered to a rachel simpson.

131
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,510
You got a photo?

132
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,200
Sending it to you now.

133
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,030
Mr.Milroy?

134
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,450
Is that the woman?

135
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,330
yeah,She's older than that,but that's,yeah,definitely her.

136
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,530
Well,thanks.

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Address on the licence is her parents' place in forest hill.

138
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,840
They still live there.

139
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,240
What's an uptown girl doing robbing a gas station?

140
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,720
And driving an old beater?

141
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,940
Okay,go talk to the parents,see what you can find out.

142
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,890
On it.

143
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
How're you doing,eddie?You got eyes yet?

144
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,000
Boss,we're working on it.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,510
Sam,what do we got?

146
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,640
Almost there.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
We've got eyes.

148
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,320
We have to go down there,try to talk to her.

149
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,800
She hasn't talked to us in 15 years.

150
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,560
You think she wants to start now?

151
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,500
Where's she been living all this time?

152
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,960
A place called the farm.

153
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,560
The rehab facility?

154
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,310
Does she have an addiction problem?

155
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,000
Rachel started drinking when she was 14.

156
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,310
By the time she turned 16,she'd moved on to cocaine.

157
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,530
Was it your idea for her to go to rehab?

158
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,240
I came home one afternoon and found her passed out on the floor.

159
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,860
I tried to wake her,but i couldn't.

160
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,490
I was so scared.

161
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,820
Okay,subject is armed with what looks like a...

162
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,020
380?

163
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,950
Three hostages.Two adults,one little girl.

164
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,500
So far they look unharmed.

165
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,150
Rachel simpson's as clean as a whistle.No criminal record.

166
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,660
She been the victim of a crime?

167
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Nothing's coming up.

168
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,560
So what's her problem with cops?

169
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,140
We could be dealing with some kind of paranoid disorder.

170
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,920
Let's hope she doesn't think the hostages are out to get her,too.

171
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,850
I don't think she sees them as the enemy.

172
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,490
What are our tactical options?

173
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,060
Explosive entry through the door?

174
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,860
Can't take the chance of setting rachel off,not with that little girl in there.

175
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,850
Okay,let me work on that.

176
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,820
I wanna go home.

177
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,220
I know,sweetie.

178
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,930
They're just trying to help.

179
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,580
I told you,if you want this to end,you have to leave!

180
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,350
I can't do that,rachel.

181
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,260
How do you know my name?

182
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,780
Rachel,listen to me.

183
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,180
You want to get out of there,i want to help you do that.

184
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,700
But first,you have to let these people go.

185
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,470
You're just trying to get me to open the door so you can shoot me.

186
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,500
No,no,i give you my word,rachel,that's not gonna happen.

187
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,560
Okay,you don't want to let everybody go,

188
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,180
how about you let the mom and the little girl go?

189
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,170
All right.

190
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,730
Thank you,rachel.

191
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,190
Thank you.

192
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Okay,here's what's gonna happen next:

193
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,630
i'm gonna have one of my men waiting near the front door,

194
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,180
but he's not there to hurt you.

195
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,900
He's there to help the woman and the child get to safety.

196
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,820
The farm was supposed to be a really good facility,

197
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,660
all about living off the land and getting back to nature.

198
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,670
Rachel get clean?

199
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,560
Yes,but then she wouldn't come home.

200
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,150
And then we found out that she and charles had gotten married.

201
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,150
Who's charles?

202
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,180
Charles stewart.He runs the farm.

203
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,920
Do you have his number?I need to talk to him.

204
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,800
Charles doesn't have a phone.

205
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,900
He doesn't want any contact with the outside world.

206
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,850
Right.I did hear that the facility is very secretive.

207
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,230
He wouldn't even let us talk to our own daughter.

208
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,750
A friend of ours is a cop.We brought him back there with us,

209
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,510
see if he could intimidate charles into letting us see rachel.

210
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,370
That work?

211
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,530
She said that we were a negative influence on her life

212
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,080
and that she never wanted to see us again.

213
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,290
Charles had already turned her against us.

214
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,000
Officer callaghan.

215
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,050
Charles has got a real hold on our daughter.

216
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,260
Now,if she's robbing a gas station,

217
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,190
i wouldn't be surprised if he was the one behind it.

218
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,710
The farm.

219
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,300
Didn't the police investigate that place a couple years ago?

220
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,180
Yeah,but no charges were laid.

221
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,390
Okay,i'm gonna head over there and see if i can talk to charles stewart.

222
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,080
Maybe he can tell us why rachel's doing this.

223
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,450
Jules,send me the address,i'll meet you there.

224
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,710
Sam,i'm gonna put you in charge of tactical.

225
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,090
Be ready with entry options in case negotiations fail.

226
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,320
All right,you got it.

227
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,520
Wordy.

228
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,160
Go slowly towards the door.

229
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,970
It's gonna be okay,honey.

230
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,590
She's getting ready to come out.

231
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,110
Everyone maintain position.

232
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,730
You open the door slowly.

233
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,090
Go slow,go slow.

234
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,740
Just don't hurt me or my little girl.

235
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,500
Go,baby,go,go.

236
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,590
It's okay,honey,grab my hand.Come towards me.

237
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,850
- That's right.
- Go,go,go.

238
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,470
Ma'am,just come towards me slowly.

239
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,370
Okay,let her go.

240
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,810
Okay,just grab my arm.Just go right behind me.

241
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,220
Stay right behind me,okay?

242
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,180
Very slowly.

243
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,860
No,you have to come back in!

244
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,400
Rachel,rachel,it's okay.

245
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,920
It's okay,rachel!

246
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,320
Rachel,it's okay!

247
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,200
No,please!Let me go!

248
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,210
How do i get out?

249
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,280
I don't know!

253
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,280
I've gotta get outta here!

254
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,360
She's completely shutting down.

255
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,450
Well,it's definitely isolated.

256
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,150
Hey,buddy!

257
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,130
Is it something you said?

258
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,550
What can i tell you?Ie got a way with teenagers.I don't know.

259
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,550
An electric fence.

260
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,990
Pretty serious about keeping people out.

261
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,250
I guess so.

262
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,690
This is private property.

263
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,420
Sir,i'm ed lane.This is jules callaghan.

264
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,530
We're with the police.

265
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,890
Are you charles stewart?

266
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,040
What is this abo?

267
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,410
Mr.Stewart,your wife robbed a gas station this morning.

268
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,490
She's holding three people hostage.

269
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,680
my mother would never do something like that.

270
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,360
- Isaac.
- She's your mother?

271
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,060
Mr.Stewart,if you can just open the gate here,we need to talk to you about rachel.

272
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,990
Isaac.

273
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,510
I'd prefer if you left your weapons outside.

274
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,250
That's against regulations.

275
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,350
We're jst here to talk,sir.

276
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,000
So,you had no idea your wife left the farm this morning?

277
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,760
none at all.

278
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,230
Is rachel okay?She hasn't hurtnyone,has she?

279
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,650
no,she hasn't,but we need your help so that we can keep everybody safe

280
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,540
isaac...

281
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,160
Go finish your chores,then work on your book report.

282
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,650
Yes,sir.

283
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,980
Sir,do you know why rachel is doing this?

284
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,340
Mr. Stewart,if younow anything,you need to tell us.

285
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,430
Uh,rachel hasn't been herself lately.

286
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,120
She's been moody,distant.

287
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,900
I'm worried she's gone back to her old ways.

288
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,280
You think she's using again?

289
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,230
Don't know.

290
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,960
How else to explain her behaviour?

291
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,230
Bring her back here.She needs help.

292
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,720
This is the bst place for her.

293
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,260
Mr.Stewart,i've never seen a rehab facility with an electric fence before.

294
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,800
The world's a dangerous place.I do whatever i can to keep  people safe.

295
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,200
Okay,we're gonna need to talk to some of rachel's friends here.

296
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,520
These people,they're recovering addicts.

297
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,390
I'm sure youan appreciate how upsetting it might be to be interrogated by the police.

298
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,140
Look,i understand that,but right now,

299
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,570
sir,we need to do everythg that we can to make sure that rachel

300
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,950
and everybody else gets out safely.

301
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,890
Charles?

302
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,950
What is it,james?

303
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,300
I need to speak with you.

304
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,220
Excuse me a moment.

305
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,580
Okay,what's going on there,eddie?What's the situation?

306
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,870
I'm telling you,boss,this guy's hiding something.

307
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,200
Okay,you keep looking.

308
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,490
We've got rachel here.Feels like she's shutting down.

309
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,940
I think she might be using again.We can't take that chance,so...

310
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,730
We need to go tactical.

311
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,120
How do you want to go in?

312
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,740
Police!Drop yur weapon!Drop your weapon!

313
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,220
No!

314
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,630
No!

315
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,750
No!Let me go!

316
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,970
Let me go!I have to go back!

317
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,230
I have to save my son!

318
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,970
What's wrong with your son?

319
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,190
just let me go.Please.

320
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,560
If your son's in trouble,rachel,you can tell us.

321
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,900
- I can't.
- Yes,you can.You can try.

322
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,670
He's gonna kill everybody.

323
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,250
Who?Who's going to kill everybody?

324
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,980
Charles!I have tgo back!

325
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,110
You have to let me go!

326
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,490
Please.

327
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,190
I have to save my son.

328
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,670
Please!

329
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,060
Please!

330
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,710
Jules,eddie,watch your backs.

331
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,470
If rachel's story checks out,

332
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,240
charles may be planning a mass murder there today.

333
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,900
Spike,what do we know about charles stewart?

334
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,130
Ex-Heroin addict.

335
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,730
D some time for possession when he was 18.

336
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,220
Looks like he got clean.

337
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,320
Started up the farm about 20 years ago.

338
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,850
About eight ars ago,a woman named linda gase went into the farm for treatment.

339
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,750
Her husba claimed that charlesas keeping her there against her will.

340
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,090
Gave the police probable cause to search the place.

341
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,060
They raid the farm in the middle of the night,they turn it upside-Down.

342
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,310
That'd explain the animosity toward the cops.

343
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,910
And they find no weapons and no evidence of criminal activity.

344
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,420
Well track her down,see what we can find out.

345
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,330
Mrs. Gase,rachel is in a lot of trouble.

346
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,080
If you know anything,please tell us.

347
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,620
Rachel would ner go back tosing drugs.

348
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,390
She wouldn't do that to isaac.

349
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,270
Was she upset about anything?

350
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,240
Problems in the marriage?

351
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,290
She and charles haven't been getng along lately.

352
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,650
Do you know why?

353
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,440
She doesn't appreciate him.

354
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,040
A man like charles deserves better than that.

355
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,230
Soundsike you're very fond of him.

356
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,830
Before met charles,i was hooked on meth.

357
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,350
Charles saved my life.

358
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,110
He saved all of us.

359
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,150
He's a hero.

360
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,640
I owe him everything.

361
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,180
Your husband believed you were being kept here against your will.

362
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
He couldn't understand why i didn't want to leave.

363
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,450
Is is my home now it the only place i can be safe.

364
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,190
Thank you.Excuse me.

365
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,670
How long have you lived here?

366
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,060
Eight years.

367
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,470
Have you,um,have you seen your family?

368
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,250
You're pretty good with that ax.

369
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,580
She never should've left the farm.

370
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,450
It's too dangerous out there.

371
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,620
Your father tell you that?

372
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,400
He knows what's best for us.

373
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,640
Let me ask you,you and the uh...

374
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,810
You and the other kids,you go  school around here?

375
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,770
My father teaches us,here at the farm.

376
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,060
So what?So you never leave?

377
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,250
No need.

378
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,430
Huck finn.

379
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,980
Pretty good book,right?

380
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,040
What do you mean,yeah?

381
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,880
Two guys going down the mississippi on a raft.

382
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,730
Retty exciting stuff,right?

383
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
I guess.

384
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,340
You never think about doing anything like that?

385
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,980
Getting out there,exploring?

386
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,520
I have everything i need right here.

387
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,830
Why would i ever want to leave?

388
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,760
Boss,charles has taughthem to feaeverything outside the farm.

389
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,490
His own son's never been off the property.

390
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,420
Yeah,you should hear how they talk about this gucharles.

391
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,170
They're totally devoted to him.

392
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,810
This is sounding like a cult mentality.

393
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,230
The people that come here,they are...

394
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,040
Desperate,and they give themselves over mind,body and spirit.

395
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,310
And trade one dependency for another.

396
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,960
And to maintain control,he convinces them that this is the only safe place.

397
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,830
Okay,well,just take a look ound,see what you can fid.

398
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,730
I needed money and gas,and then i was gonna go back and get isaac.

399
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,700
You should've gone to the polce.

400
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,240
I know,rachel,you think we're the bad guys,

401
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,030
but it's charles who's threatening to kill all those people,including your son.

402
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,360
No.

403
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,300
Come on.Let me help you.

404
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,200
I can't do that until you start trusting me.

405
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,320
Please.

406
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,740
Drop your weapon!

407
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,420
Safety's on there,james.

408
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,390
And this is an mp5 submachine gun.

409
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,950
Fire800 rounds per minute,400 metres per seco.

410
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,990
So,unless you want a demonstration,

411
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,970
i ggest you drop your weapon and we can talk about this.

412
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,290
My father was right.

413
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,190
You can'te trusted.

414
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,990
Isaac,that's not true.

415
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,610
We're here to help you,son.

416
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,890
You're lying.

417
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,150
Isaac,put t gun down!

418
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,300
Isaac!

419
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,530
You first!

420
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,400
Put  down!

421
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,370
Isaac...

422
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,480
Do it.

423
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,920
Okay,son.All right.

424
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,020
Put your hands behind your head.

425
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,560
Okay,take it easy.

426
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,650
- It's okay.
- turn around.

427
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,280
Charles is gonna want to have a word with you.

428
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,540
Sarge,we got a probl.

429
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,680
What's gog on,jules?

430
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,920
They got ed.

431
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,730
Isaac and one of charles' men took him at gunpoint.

432
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,930
Where are you now?

433
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,530
I'm still in theerimeter.I'm gonna go after him.

434
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,830
You should wait for backup.

435
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,040
Sam's right.They're probably already looking for you.

436
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,020
Just stay out of sight.We're on our way.

437
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,970
Copy that.

438
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,790
They wouldn't kidnap a cop unless something serious was going down.

439
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,030
Okay,team one,listen up.

440
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,640
We assume that all radio contact has been compromised.

441
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,510
From here on out,cell phones only.

442
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,560
Rachel,if i'm gonna have any chance of stopping charles from doing anything stupid,

443
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,780
you need to tell me everything you know about him.

444
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,100
Like,do you have any idea why he would wanna do this?

445
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,830
I heard him saying something about voices guiding him.

446
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,900
Voices?What do they tell him?

447
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,610
That death is thenly thing that will keep his people safe.

448
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,980
And how often does he hear them?

449
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,060
Only one other time as far as i know.

450
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,780
When charles was in his twenties,he,he almost died of heroin overdose.

451
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,570
When he came to,he said the voices saved him,

452
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,260
told him he needed to get clean,help others do the same.

453
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,220
So,he believes the only way to do that is by isolating them from the outside world?

454
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,820
It wasn't always like that.

455
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,560
People would get clean,they used to leave.

456
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,010
So what changed?

457
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,400
About seven years ago,he lped a guy named gary kichis cocaine habit.

458
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,450
He went home,but after a few months he started using again.

459
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,900
He died of an overdose.

460
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,690
That's when the fences went up.

461
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,810
Charles was afraid that if anyone left the farm,

462
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,770
they would end up like gary.

463
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,760
He became more and more parano.

464
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,390
Bought guns...

465
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,100
Wouldn't let anyone in or out.

466
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,440
What mes a man like that go from wanting to keep people everyone safe to wanting to kill them all?

467
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,950
Thank you,jas.

468
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:01,750
And put these someplace safe,please.

469
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,730
This how you treat all your guests?

470
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,830
What are you taking,charles?

471
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,050
If you're using again,you can't thk straight.

472
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,700
Are you really gonna kill all thes people?

473
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,570
******Is that why you're doing this?

474
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,050
I'm doing this to save my people.

475
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,080
By what,charles?By sentencing them to death?

476
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,690
You're judging somethin you couldn't possibly uerstand.

477
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,970
If you're doing it to save thm,why don't you just tell them,charles?

478
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,180
Why keep it from them?

479
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,160
Thespeople are like my children,

480
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,000
and children don't always know what's best for them.

481
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,220
Spike,let's get rachel in the truck.

482
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,840
Okay,rachel,we need you to draw a map of the farm.

483
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,010
Every way in,how many buildings there are,

484
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,010
where they're situated,okay?

485
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,360
This way,please.

486
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,340
This way,right now.Thank you.

487
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,830
jules,we're here.How're you doing?

488
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,080
I'm fine.

489
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,450
I've set  a sniper perch in the centre of the compound.

490
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,530
Any sign of eddie?

491
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,180
Negative.And charles must be getting nervous.

492
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,890
He's got two armed guards at the main gate.

493
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,000
Copy that.

494
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,140
Keep your eyes open anything that might tell us how he's planning on killing these people.

495
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,540
I say we take charles first.

496
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,280
Yeah,cut off the head of thenake.

497
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,540
Okay,let me try talking to him first.

498
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,610
What about isaac?

499
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,370
Your own son.Your own flesh and blood.

500
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
You're telling me you're willing to kill him,too?

501
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,710
More than anyone.

502
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,990
Isaac needs to take this journey with me.

503
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,890
That'd be for you.

504
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,190
This is charles.

505
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,130
Hello,charles,my name is sergeant gregory parker.

506
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,810
I'm with the police strategic response unit.

507
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,980
I understand you're holding one of my colleagues.

508
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,740
Any chance you can tell me how he's dng?

509
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,740
He's fine.

510
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,110
Oh,thank you very much.I'm glad to hear that.

511
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,410
Il let him go if you let my wife come home.

512
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,310
Well,i'm sorry.I cannot agree to do that.

513
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,400
Then there's nothing left to say.

514
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,880
Okay,charles,hold on.

515
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,860
Help me understand.

516
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,130
You created the farm to help people,to savtheir lives.

517
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,260
So why are you doing this?

518
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,150
my people need me.I can't desert them.

519
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,560
Come on,listen to me.No one has to die today.

520
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,040
It's not too late to call this thing off.

521
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,390
I wish that were true.

522
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,870
Get the supplies and gather everyone into the barn.

523
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,220
it's time.

524
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,560
You gonna keep trying to talk him down?

525
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,810
I oubt it'll work.

526
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,080
Guy thkshat what he's doing is necessary.He's like noble even.

527
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,940
Options,sam?

528
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,010
Our best point of entry is right here alongside an old delivery road,

529
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,720
that,according to rachel,not many people know about it.

530
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,870
Coming with us,boss?

531
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,890

00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,810
Isaac,you gotta cut me loose here,son.

534
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,610
You're not going anywhe until the cops let my mom come home.

535
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,510
They're not gonna let your mother come back here to be killed.

536
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,820
Isaac,it's that simple.

537
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,990
What're you talking about?

538
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,310
You don't know what's going on here,do you?

539
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,760
Okay,isaac,listen to me.

540
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,360
Your father plans to kill everyone onhis farm,including you.

541
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,710
No,i don't believe yo why do you think he doesn't want me looking around?

542
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,690
isaac.

543
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,530
He's hiding something.

544
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,800

545
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,260
Isaac...

546
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,740
You mother found out about it.

547
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,650
That's why she's tryig to get money,to get you out of here.

548
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,380
Isaac,she's trying to save your life.

549
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,430
No.

550
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,800
My father said that you'd say anything to get meo let you go.

551
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,610
I understand that you love your father

552
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,940
and you have been raised to follow him without question.

553
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,920
But there comes a time in all of our lives,

554
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,760
son,when we have to think for ourselves.

555
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,900
Now what your father's doing is wrong.

556
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,210
Your mother knows that.

557
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,730
Now,if you can help me,i can stop him.

558
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,980
I can fix it.

559
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,070
Isaac?

560
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,460
Your father needs to see you.

561
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,890
Come on.

562
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,400

One,two,three.

566
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,090
All clear.

567
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,480
All right,let's move.

568
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,240
Sar,they've got ed at charles' house.

569
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,460
It's the first building northeast of the barn.

570
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,520
Copy,jules.

571
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,420
What do you want to do?

572
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,930
All right,wordy,leah,you take the main gate.

573
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,110
The rest of us will go after ed.

574
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,080
Copy.

575
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,440

This what it takes to get you outta the truck?

577
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,430
He didn't gag you?

578
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,680
You get charles?

579
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,760
No,not yet.

580
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,830
He was taking some kind of drug,probably hallucinogenics.

581
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,140
That would explain his panoia and delusions.

582
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,950
What do you need?

583
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,960
You got your knife?

584
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,390
Yeah,hold on.

585
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,160
Morphe.

586
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,410
Demerol.

587
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,480
Prescription pain killer

588
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,470
hey,winnie see if you can get a hold of a dr.Jane barkin.

589
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,200
She prescribed some drugs for charles and i want to know why.

590
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,660
And let the team know that edie's safe and we're back on com.

591
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,770

00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,190
That's it.We're safer inside.

596
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,230
Sarge,they're ushering everyone into the main barn.

597
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,050
Do you see any weapons?

598
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,900
They're carrying three containers.

599
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,240
Can you tell what's in 'em?

600
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,540
One says chlorine.

601
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,000
The other one says n-H.

602
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,020
Nh-3?

603
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,000
Looks like it.

604
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,840
Ammonia.

605
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,090

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,340
It's okay.

614

00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,780
He's gone!He's gone!

713
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,920
Isaac,he's gone.

714
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,700
I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

715
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,090
There's nothing you can do.

716
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,970
No!

717
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:44,730
- It's over.
- Dad!

718
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,650
? It's with a veil ?

719
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,710
? She gives her heart ?

720
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:10,680
? Is she afraid that they'll fall apart ?

721
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:29,300
? It's with a word whispered alive ?

722
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,610
? The depths of his heart ?

723
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:39,150
? There it confides swallowed in fear ?

724
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:49,040
? And handled in doubt Afraid that it can't Gon without ?

725
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,270
? Will they miss a rose ?

726
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,650
? If blind to the bloom ?

727
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,600
? Darkness for light ?

728
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,030
? And shadows to lose ?

729
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,360
? The beacons for them ?

730
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,650
? The calling of stars ?

731
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,900
? A pleading for two ?

732
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,200
? Don't fall apart ?

733
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,570
? They met at the gate Late afternoon ?

734
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:28,200
? The mouths of the trees Whisper to news ?

735
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,620
? Shoes underfoot And soullit alive ?

736
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:41,050
? Unsure of themselves But feeling the tide ?

737
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,670
Think th kid'll be okay?

738
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,050

739
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,480
He's got a good head on his shoulders.
