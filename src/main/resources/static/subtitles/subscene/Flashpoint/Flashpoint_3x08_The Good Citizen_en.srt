1
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,430
Where you going?

2
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,120
I'm gonna go see some friends.

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,380
- No!
- Those guys are not your friends.

4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,160
- You're just business to them.
- Just let go.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,280
No.I am not gonna let them
suck the life out of you.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,580
Come on,jimmy!

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,880
Jimmy!

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,470
Help me save him!

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,130
He's my brother!Come on,jimmy!

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,930
It's too late.

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,230
Uh,excuse me.

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,170
I heard you threw donnie
outta here last night.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,420
Is that true?

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,640
Is it true?

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,490
This is my place.I get to
decide who comes in,who doesn't.

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,220
What do you got against
our friend donnie?

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,290
I mean what's wrong with a guy who wants to
sit at a bar and have a quiet conversation?

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,030
I don't like him doing
business in my place.

19
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,430
He's welcome to do it someplace else.

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,890
You're messing with our business.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,370
And when you mess with our
business,we mess with yours.

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,920
Bar owner: what're you doing?

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,430
No,don't! Please!

24
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,270
Oh,you sons of bitches!

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,880
Language!

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,730
This is a family establishment.

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,170
Come on,guys!

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,910
Let's talk this over!

29
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,040
Please.

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,350
He's the local dealer.

31
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,600
Stop!

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,180
You have to get down here.

33
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,590
The gatto nero.College street.

34
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,150
Stop!

35
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,670
You don't need to do that,guys!

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,510
Stop!

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,110
Bastards!

38
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,610
Don't touch that! Don't touch that.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,210
No.It belonged to my wife.

40
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,300
What do you think,vince?

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,330
- Nice!
- Crystal.You know,i bought some like this for my mom once.

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,820
Cost a couple stacks.

43
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,140
- What's this cost?
- It's not about what it costs.

44
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,810
Please.

45
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,790
Please.

46
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,260
Back off!

47
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,260
Your call.

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,250
Oh,my god!

49
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,580
He has a gun.Please hurry!

50
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,770
You all right?

51
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,810
Yeah,yeah.

52
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,330
Watch it!

53
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,560
Wh-what're you doing?Let it go.

54
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,530
I'm not letting it go.

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,410
Oh,shelley,one more thing... Um,you
want to go to eddie's tonight?

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,060
Barbeque,kids.

57
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,910
- What time?
- I don't know.Like 6:00?

58
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,240
Team one,hot call.

59
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,480
12 clouster street.Shots fired.

60
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,550
Better make it 8:00.

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,070
eight o'clock.Love ya,gotta go.

62
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,620
Team one,seconds away.

63
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,700
Copy.

64
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,310
Copy,copy.Command truck's on its way.

65
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,510
First responder?Talk to me fast,officer.

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,060
We've got two males,baseball bats and
a handgun,start tearing the place apart.

67
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,050
A patron jumps in,the gun
discharges,everybody runs.

68
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,890
Whose gun?

69
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,090
The guys wrecking the bar.

70
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,370
- You get a description?
- Yup.

71
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,020
Mid-20s,long coats.

72
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,130
One's 6'4" with dreadlocks,injury
on the right arm.

73
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,700
The other's a small
build,jeans,black t-shirt.

74
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,210
No word on the good samaritan.

75
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,270
The good samaritan?

76
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,480
- That's what the owner called him.
- Thanks,officer.

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,790
Sam,you get those descriptions?

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,290
Yeah.Well,we're right behind them.

79
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,720
- We move fast...
- We can bring 'em in.

80
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,960
Okay,we work a grid.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,620
Wordy,you are alpha with me.We
will work north and south.

82
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,610
Sam,leah,bravo,east
and west.Let's move it.

83
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,930
Jules,let's see what we can find out.

84
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,440
Do you know why these men
would be targeting your place?

85
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,620
They're drug dealers.

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,320
I threw out one of
their friends last night.

87
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,720
You stood up to them.

88
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,920
This is what it got me.

89
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,570
You know the men who did this?

90
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,250
Leon is the little one.Vince is
the big one.That's all i know.

91
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,860
And who's the man who attacked them?

92
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,360
He didn't attack them.

93
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,560
He chased them out.

94
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,960
I didn't get a look at him.

95
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,840
Did he take his handgun?

96
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,840
Two against one.I'm just wondering
how he managed to chase them out?

97
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,100
Yeah,he had the gun.

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,990
It's sick.

99
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,560
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,890
I grew up here.

101
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,640
I didn't know that.

102
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,000
Used to be kids in the streets all hours,hide
and seek,people outside on their patios.

103
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,950
You sitting on the back of a
pickup,strummin' your first guitar.

104
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,080
I just hate to see what's happened.

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,250
I hear you,wordy,but you
gotta talk to city hall.

106
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,600
There were a lot more cops
on the street back then.

107
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,460
Team one,turns out our
good samaritan is armed.

108
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,420
Got i.D.?

109
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,140
Not yet,but he may be going
after the same target as you.

110
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,620
So what?We've got some citizen
trying to be a vigilante?

111
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,470
Looks that way.

112
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,280
- Vigilante?
- What would you call him?

113
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,910
Some guys try to intimidate a local businessman,and this
guy steps up,fights back... I'd call him a good citizen.

114
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,740
A good citizen in
pursuit with a firearm.

115
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,330
It's okay,it's okay.

116
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,100
How you doing,leon?

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,130
I'm good. How about you?

118
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,160
Proud of yourself?You get a
rush out of what you did? Huh?

119
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,980
Takes a big man to bust up someone's place,someone's
treasures; pieces of a life that they actually worked for.

120
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,860
Takes a real big man.

121
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,000
What do you want?You just
tell me what you want.

122
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,780
So you got no idea what he looks like
- tall,short,heavyset,blond,brunette... Stop me here.

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,150
No? Nothing's coming to you?

124
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,850
Everything happened really fast.

125
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,620
You got a pretty good
look at the other two guys.

126
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,530
Alphonse,look,i realize
he did you a favour.

127
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,590
But he chased two men out of here with a loaded weapon,and
we'd like to help him before he gets in too deep.

128
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,360
I never saw him before.

129
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,930
- You sure about that?
- Absolutely.

130
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,820
What about you,ma'am?Do
you remember anything?

131
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,890
I just... I was in the back here.

132
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,260
I didn't see the guy at all.

133
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,650
Ed,uniforms called in a man in dreads in a
long coat running south on parliament street.

134
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,790
Dreadlocks,three o'clock!

135
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,460
In pursuit on foot,corner
of montrose and college.

136
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,170
Ed,right there!Stay there!Right now!

137
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,230
Do not move! Do not move!

138
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,130
Give me your hands!Let me see
your hands! Let me see your hands!

139
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,090
You got any weapons?!Get up!

140
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,870
It's dislocated.

141
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,740
- What's your name?
- What's your name?!

142
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,500
What's up,eddie?

143
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,060
Boss,we got one of the dealers.

144
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,860
The name he gave is vince packer.

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,730
Okay,spike,see if you can get
anything on a vince packer.

146
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,230
On it,boss.

147
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,130
Parker: look for any connections
to someone named leon.

148
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,660
Our friend vince denies vandalizing "the
gatto nero" or knowing anyone named leon.

149
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,250
Apparently he dislocated his shoulder playing hockey this
morning,in a neighbourhood that lost its rink five years ago.

150
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,840
Ed,your guy vince?

151
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,120
He gets busted a lot
for such a good athlete.

152
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,420
Possession,assault... And look at this
- last time he went down,he went down with fellow athlete leon weeks.

153
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,020
Where can we find mr.Weeks?

154
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,070
If he's headed home,he's
right in the neighborhood.

155
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,100
211 watson.That's clouster and watson.

156
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,880
Two blocks from us.We're on it.

157
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,230
Shots fired!Alley west of clouster!

158
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,000
On it.

159
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,320
Sam,this guy's really a mess.

160
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,580
Winnie,we need an ambulance.

161
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,780
Bad news,boss.The vigilante
has kicked it up a notch.

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,400
Sending emt's to your gps location now.

167
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,170
Talk to me,sam.

168
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,860
The subject from the bar has been shot.

169
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,590
Bullet wounds in both legs.

170
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,380
It's nasty,but it's
not life-threatening.

171
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,160
Looks like he was carrying some cocaine.

172
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,780
This is circumstantial!

173
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,300
You're leon weeks,right?

174
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,280
I want a lawyer.I know my rights.

175
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,550
We're not here about the drugs.

176
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,560
Oh,yeah.Right.I know how this works.

177
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,320
You're gonna plant some drugs,then
you're gonna try and pin it on me.

178
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,100
Leon,we just wanna know who shot you.

179
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,390
That's all.

180
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,050
Cooper.Robert cooper.

181
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,850
Thanks,leon,we've got the
spelling.Spike,you copy that?

182
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,090
Get right back to ya.

183
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,860
Robert cooper.

184
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,850
- What?You know him?
- Not well.

185
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,680
My dad and i used to hang out at his
dad's hardware store all the time.

186
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,140
Robert cooper's taking
this pretty personally,leon.

187
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,250
Was there something here you want to
tell me,like why he'd want to shoot you?

188
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,400
The guy's a wacko.

189
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,770
He's out of control.You
gotta stop him,okay?

190
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,230
Maybe cooper's not fond of
people in your line of work.

191
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,540
I said this is circumstantial.

192
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,090
Guys,listen to this.

193
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,600
"a west end neighbourhood sentinel association won a court
battle which would have the imperial arms apartments torn down.

194
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,270
President and local
businessman,robert cooper,

195
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,810
said 'the association has dealt a body blow to the
drug dealers trying to take over our neighbourhood.

196
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,920
'" From community activist to vigilante.

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,150
I'm sending you a
picture of him right now.

198
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,090
Alphonse... You know it's illegal
to lie to the police,right?

199
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,680
Robert cooper was your good samaritan.

200
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,830
Now how do you not recognize the
president of your neighborhood sentinel?

201
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,090
I didn't want to get him in trouble.

202
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,730
- He just shot a man.
- Oh my god.

203
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,790
Yeah,might not have happened if
you had given us a straight answer.

204
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,680
Alphonse,we need to bring him in
here before he hurts anybody else.

205
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,550
You got an address,a phone
number?Anything you got.

206
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,990
I don't know where he's
living.You'll have to ask his wife.

207
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,000
So what's her name?

208
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,360
Patty cooper.

209
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,060
Let's get her down here,jules.

210
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,170
Leon,we need to talk to
you about your crew,buddy.

211
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,520
I don't know... What crew?

212
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,250
Cooper's declared war.You
think he's gonna stop with you?

213
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,640
Leon: he wanted me to give up names and addresses for the guys i work with
- the top guys.

214
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,700
Did you tell him?

215
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,390
I don't know the top
guys.I only talk to torres.

216
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,750
- Torres?
- John torres.He's the middle guy.

217
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,960
That's all i know.That's all i told him.

218
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,160
All right,let's see what we
can find out about this torres.

219
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,350
You think he's gonna go after
every dealer in the area?

220
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,650
That could take a while
in this neighbourhood.

221
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,830
Sorry,leah,what about
this neighbourhood?

222
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,320
When i was a firefighter i took a lot of
drug-related calls,especially in this neighbourhood.

223
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,630
But bobby doesn't own a gun.

224
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,210
It appears he took it from one of the
men that he assaulted this morning.

225
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,840
We believe robert's been hunting
down a local gang of drug dealers.

226
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,210
Did you know that he was planning
on doing something like that?

227
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,920
No. No. God,no.

228
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,560
I would have called
the police immediately.

229
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,220
Well,we need to know what made him do this.Can
you tell us about his state of mind lately?

230
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,130
He's angry... About what happened to the
neighbourhood,about what happened to his brother.

231
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,290
His brother?

232
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,680
Jimmy.He's... He's younger.

233
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,350
They never really had an easy time.

234
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,320
Their mom died a long time ago,so it
was just bobby and jimmy and their dad -

235
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,330
they were close
- and then me.

236
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,840
For a few years,we
ran the store together.

237
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,910
We were happy.

238
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,990
We were good.

239
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,150
What happened?

240
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,990
Their dad died... And
jimmy started using.

241
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,420
Jimmy became an addict?

242
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,870
Not overnight.It was a long slide down.

243
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,230
We lost the jimmy that we loved.

244
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,600
We tried to help him.We
did the best we could.

245
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,760
Jimmy.

246
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,380
Hey,how're you guys
doing?What can i get ya?

247
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,500
I just got a call from
gordie.Where the hell were you?

248
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,000
Aw,jeez.Man,3:30.

249
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,880
you told me you wanted
to work in the dealership.

250
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,190
- I put my neck on the line,i get the job for you...
- Okay,enough.

251
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,410
I get the message loud and clear.

252
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,850
I let you down... Again.

253
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,290
Where are you going?

254
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,410
I'm gonna go meet some friends.

255
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,950
Cooper: hey,i know who you mean,and
those guys are not your friends.

256
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,550
Now you're gonna tell
me who my friends are?

257
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,830
Get the hell off me.

258
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,570
You're not their friend,jimmy,okay?

259
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,010
You're just business to them.

260
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,270
You son of a bitch,just let go.

261
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,130
No,no.Hey,listen to me,all right?

262
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,650
I am not gonna let them
suck the life out of you.

263
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,040
Let me go.Just let... Go!

264
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,600
If you walk out of that
door,i am done with you.

265
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,480
I didn't mean that.

266
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,990
- I'm gonna go.
- I know.

267
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,950
- Bobby!
- No.

268
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,210
Jimmy!

269
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,020
He's not gonna give up looking for him.

270
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,260
When was the last time you two spoke?

271
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,480
When he ran after jimmy
about two days ago.

272
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,940
Do you mind me asking why he left?

273
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,760
Losing the store,losing
jimmy... I mean he's a good guy.

274
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,640
He's lost.It's just eating him up.

275
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,270
Just uh... Hold on a second.

276
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,640
Okay,team,new deal.

277
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,150
Robert cooper's got a
little brother,jimmy.

278
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,010
Jimmy got hooked with the local dealers...
And now robert's trying to track them down.

279
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,980
So,it's personal.

280
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,520
Yeah,it's starting to look that way.

281
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,020
Boss,i did a credit
card search on cooper.

282
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,390
Good work,spike.Whatchya got?

283
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,440
I got an address.

284
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,530
He just moved into a
by-the-week rooming house.

285
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,000
112 mcarthur.

286
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,770
Team one,seconds away.

287
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,570
I'm gonna apologize to wordy.

288
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,110
He's got a real
connection to this place.

289
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,170
I didn't need to push.

290
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,110
Word of advice for the
rookie from the last one?

291
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,860
When i joined the team i made a lot of
mistakes,i did my share of apologizing.

292
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,910
But the one thing i never had to
apologize for was speaking my mind.

293
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,820
You see something you
think affects the call,

294
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,590
like your general impression of a neighbourhood
based on professional experience,you say it.

295
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,930
What's up?

296
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,940
You tell me.

297
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,480
Uh,i don't know,you
know,busy... Workin'.

298
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,360
I'm coming out of my house this morning and two
high-ranking security agents want to take me out for coffee.

299
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,190
Oh... That.

300
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,350
Yeah,that.

301
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,900
And they wanna talk to me about you.

302
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,770
It's not what you think.

303
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,070
- No?
- No.

304
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,400
Okay.

305
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,900
We'll pick this up later,all right?

306
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,250
Second floor,end of the hall.

307
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,400
Wordy,you're alpha with me.

308
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,140
Sam,leah
- bravo.

309
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,070
Let's do it.

310
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,740
Police,freeze! Police! Police!

311
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,260
Clear.

312
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,750
Boss,cooper's not here.

313
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,340
Thanks,eddie.

314
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,940
All right.

315
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,340
The neighbourhood sentinel seemed like they were getting
somewhere,so why would robert do something like this?

316
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,650
Things started turning bad when
the family business burnt down.

317
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,020
The hardware store?When was that?

318
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,920
A few weeks ago.Bobby was sure it
was the drug dealers out to get him.

319
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,610
What?Because the sentinel had
closed down one of their buildings?

320
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,040
Yeah,retaliation.

321
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,630
The family store meant a lot to him.

322
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,450
But,you know,he didn't
talk about his feelings.

323
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,990
But he was taking it pretty hard.

324
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,230
Well,he hated feeling helpless.

325
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,830
He became obsessed with
fixing things,like his dad.

326
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,740
It was all about fixing things.

327
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,380
But this wasn't something that he could fix
and he wouldn't talk about it,not even patty.

328
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,380
After a few weeks,he just... He lost it.

329
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,810
So he left his wife,moved in here.

330
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,020
Pictures of his family;
that's a good sign.

331
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,080
Used to go to that
store every halloween.

332
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,930
Old man cooper really went all out.

333
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,890
It's a shame that place is gone.

334
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,860
All right.

335
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,810
Boss,i found cooper's brother.

336
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,350
That's good.How soon
can we get him here?

337
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,800
He's not going anywhere.

338
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,830
- Why not?
- He's in the morgue.

339
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,630
Jimmy cooper o.D.'D early this morning.

340
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,680
Who found jimmy cooper's body?

341
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,970
Dispatch said it was
an anonymous 911 call.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,370
Someone saw him having a seizure
right in the middle of the street.

343
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,280
At least someone cared
enough to call it in.

344
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,740
Think cooper knows his brother died?

345
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,580
If he does,it could
have been the trigger.

346
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,490
I'm gonna talk to the
paramedics involved.

347
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,480
I guess i go tell patty.

348
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,380
Spike,i've got some
friends at "guns and gangs.

349
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,410
" see if you can get
some intel on john torres.

350
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,090
The middle man.Copy.

351
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,100
All right,we find
torres,maybe we'll find cooper.

352
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,330
So,michaelangelo,international
man of mystery.

353
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,110
- He told you?
- Yeah.

354
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,510
He's not happy.

355
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,150
He doesn't like to see
the family break up.

356
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,180
Tell me about it.

357
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,220
- But he's proud of you.
- Really?

358
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,320
Federal agency seeks you
out?That's a big deal.

359
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,370
Yeah?

360
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,060
Y- eah.- Yeah.
Thanks,jules.

361
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,820
So,is this the guy from last night?

362
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,100
Yeah,that was him.

363
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,070
Came running over when he
saw us working on his brother.

364
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,650
He totally freaked out.

365
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,300
So was the brother still
alive when cooper got to him?

366
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,390
He was circling the drain,but
cooper wouldn't give up on him.

367
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,350
Clear! Charge to 360.

368
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,790
and clear!

369
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,400
Come on,jimmy. Come
on,jimmy,stay with me.

370
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,670
Stay with me,buddy,come on.

371
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,720
Come on.

372
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,290
I'm sorry,he's gone.

373
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,700
No,no he's not.Keep trying!

374
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,120
-I'm sorry.
-No!

375
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,590
Come on,jimmy.

376
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,370
I'm sorry,sir,you have to let him go.

377
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,860
No!

378
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,590
Come on,jimmy.

379
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,410
Jimmy!Jimmy,please!

380
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,050
No!No,he's not some junkie!

381
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,080
He's my brother!

382
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,360
He's my brother!

383
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,080
it's too late,sir.

384
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,010
No!

386
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,500
Jimmy...

387
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,110
Thanks,guys.

388
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,230
Seeing your kid brother
die right in front of you...

389
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,970
So he's upset about his brother's death,and
blames it on the people who sold him drugs.

390
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,210
And now he's out for blood.

391
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,770
Guys,that middle man leon
mentioned,john torres,

392
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,940
his name comes up in connection
with the steele brothers.

393
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,890
The steele brothers.

394
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,950
I've heard that name before.

395
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,480
Yeah,real up and comers.

396
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,850
They allegedly run the
coke trade this end of town.

397
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,880
Why allegedly?

398
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,190
Drug squad's been building a file.

399
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,910
The steele brothers,they
come from money.

400
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,980
Mom and dad disowned
them,but not before grady

401
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,580
used daddy's money to buy
into the trade big time.

402
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,480
Looks like his kid brother
dru got into the business,too.

403
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,210
They got money,they move around.

404
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,390
Yeah,and the cops have
never been able to touch 'em.

405
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,370
I guess they keep a pretty low profile.

406
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,400
They're most likely
cooper's number one target.

407
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,240
So we'd better find
them before cooper does.

408
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,990
We got an address on
the steele brothers?

409
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,630
No last known.Like i
said,they move around.

410
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,280
But what i do have is a lead
on their middle man,john torres.

411
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,650
I'm sending you photos.

412
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,330
Torres does business out of a
blue panel van with spoke rims.

413
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,130
Perfect mobile office.

414
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,640
Normally trolls the area
between bloor and gerrard.

415
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,610
Spike,let's access city traffic
cameras,help us narrow down the search.

416
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,690
On it.

417
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,890
Okay,guys,let's work the grid.

418
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,780
Let's go.

419
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,990
-Problem? 
-No problem.

420
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,570
Anyone have eyes?

421
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,700
Negative.

422
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,130
Still looking.

423
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,230
Wordy,you got something
to say,spit it out.

424
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,310
We protect drug dealers now?

425
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,600
We keep the peace.

426
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,340
If that includes stopping some guy from
shooting up a bunch of drug dealers,

427
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,220
then,yeah,that's what we do.

428
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,460
Great,so,when we catch up to him and he
doesn't share our feelings about civic order...

429
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,470
We make him listen.

430
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,460
And if he doesn't listen,and it's
down to him or the drug dealer?

431
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,950
Wordy?

432
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,800
Yeah,leah.

433
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,480
When bullets start flying,they
don't just hit drug dealers.

434
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,440
Wordy,we protect everybody,all right?

435
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,210
We protect the families,and,yeah,we
protect the dealers.

436
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,370
And we protect cooper.

437
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,300
I mean who do you think's gonna be
more familiar with the use of firearms?

438
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,350
All right,we got three vans matching
the description in your vicinity.

439
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,060
Someone reported music blaring from a blue
panel van parked behind wayne's tavern.

440
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,920
Uni in the area confirmed
the van had spoke rims.

441
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm betting that's our guy.

442
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,630
Team one,move in!

443
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,350
The cab's empty.

444
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,350
Check the back.

445
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,800
I can't see in.

446
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,860
The door's locked.

447
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,410
Mr. Torres,this is the police!

448
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,630
Please exit your vehicle!

449
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,390
Can't hear anything
over that music,eddie!

450
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,920
Wordy,let's go!Let's go!

451
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,500
Stack it up.

452
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,430
Police!

453
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,900
Looks like cooper beat us here.

454
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,660
He's been shot in the stomach.

455
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,990
Winnie,we need an emt here immediately.

456
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,040
Copy that.

457
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,410
Never thought i'd be...
So happy to see the cops.

458
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,650
Did cooper do this to you?

459
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,680
How long ago?

460
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,720
Don't know!

461
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,540
Half hour,maybe.

462
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,850
Let me guess: he was looking
for the steele brothers.

463
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,780
Did you tell him where they're at?

464
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,110
No choice!

465
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,500
What's the address?!

466
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,010
Mr. Torres,i know you don't
want to give up your bosses,

467
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,900
but unless you tell us where they
are,robert cooper gonna kill 'em.

468
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,660
The steele brothers can handle cooper.

469
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,590
He got the drop on you,didn't he?

470
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,070
The emt's are here,

471
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,440
but they won't treat you 'til
we give them the all clear.

472
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,650
24 aynes road.

473
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,930
Aynes.Thank you.

474
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,010
We got an address.

475
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,870
Let's go!

476
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,720
Let the emt's through!

477
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,020
Patty,it's me.

478
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,490
Oh,bobby,thank god!

479
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,390
Are you okay?

480
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,350
Winnie,put a trace on
patty cooper's cell phone.

481
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,510
I'm on it.

482
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,360
Listen,i heard about jimmy.

483
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,730
I am so sorry!

484
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,550
Please,bobby,just come home!

485
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,030
Patty,listen to me...
Bobby,you're scaring me!

486
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,350
Please come home!

487
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,920
There's something i've gotta do.

488
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,790
It's,it's nearly over.

489
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,700
Bobby,you're scaring me!Okay?

490
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,050
Just come home!

491
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,860
And no matter what happens i need...

492
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,040
No matter what happens,i need
you to know that i love you.

493
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,080
Where are you?!

494
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,620
I'll come get you!

495
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,010
Bobby?

496
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,130
Oh,bobby!

497
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,970
He's gone.

498
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,060
Sorry,jules,i didn't get it.

499
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,340
Sarge,cooper contacted his wife.

500
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,920
You get a lock on his location?

501
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,020
No,it was too quick.

502
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,590
But he said that he needed to do
something and that he loves her.

503
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,160
Either way,he knows
it's not gonna end well.

504
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,690
What the hell's going on here?

505
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,470
The cops are all over
torres,and not just regular cops.

506
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,280
Swat.

507
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,520
Torres is not gonna talk.

508
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,680
I don't wanna go to jail,man.

509
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,840
No one is going to jail.

510
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,690
We need to clear the supply
and lay low for a while.

511
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,370
Just... Just 'til the dust settles.

512
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,510
Hey,listen!

513
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,600
The cops are always
gonna be after us,dru.

514
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,350
The trick is not to panic.

515
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,310
When you panic,you make mistakes.

516
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,210
I don't know,man.

517
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,060
Okay,this is why... Come on,grady
- you freak out over everything.

518
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,960
That's not true.

519
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,110
If you don't have the
stomach for this... I do.

520
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,110
I swear.

521
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,680
Really? Yeah.

522
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,850
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

523
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,970
Now put this back where it belongs.

524
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,620
Hey,i got us tickets
to the game tonight.

525
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,440
I don't think you're gonna make it.

526
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,920
That's a lot of money you've got there.

527
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,550
Who the hell are you?

528
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,130
You want it?

529
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,410
It's yours.

530
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,180
Just let him go.

531
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,850
You must make a good living.

532
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,250
$50,000
- all yours.

533
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,650
Just let him go and walk out that door.

534
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,890
Is that's all your brother's
life is worth to you,hmm?

535
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,860
$50 grand?

536
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,620
I can give you whatever you want.

537
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,880
Whatever i want,huh?

538
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,280
Name it.

539
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,880
I want my brother back.

540
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,090
You killed him.

541
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,550
You killed jimmy.

542
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,230
I don't even know anyone named jimmy.

543
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,890
He was one of your best customers!

544
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,390
We don't know our customers.

545
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,210
You don't know your... He
died early this morning!

546
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,350
Overdose!

547
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,730
Okay,man,i'm sorry.

548
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,010
That's rough.

549
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,090
I tried to help him,but i couldn't.

550
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,400
Does that seem right to you?

551
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,640
Cooper's armed.

552
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,590
We have every reason to believe
the steele brothers are armed.

553
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,930
But we go in aggressive,we
could trigger a firefight.

554
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,360
Can't go in without intel.

555
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,880
-Wordy,leah -
eyes. -Got it.

556
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,270
Sam... I'll find a perch.

557
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,880
Transmitting.

558
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,960
Boss,we're good.

559
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,220
All right,he's got 'em.

560
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,430
Look at him.

561
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,350
His arm's shaking,he's breathing hard.

562
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,130
He's working up the
courage to kill them.

563
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,680
We're running out of time.

564
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,210
Sam,do you have the solution?

565
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,250
Negative.

566
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,950
Jules,cooper's got himself barricaded

567
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,080
inside the house with
the steele brothers.

568
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,000
Let's bring patty down here,maybe she
can help us get through to her husband.

569
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,380
Copy that.Come with me.

570
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,290
Did they find bobby?

571
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,260
Yeah,i'm gonna take you to him.Come on.

572
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,860
Please,don't.

573
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,650
Okay there,easy,easy,easy.

574
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,630
Open that bag of coke
and pour it on the table.

575
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,450
Okay,no problem.

576
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,480
How much do you want?

577
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,630
The whole bag.

578
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,410
Okay. All right.

579
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,160
They're breaking out the drugs.

580
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,560
I didn't think cooper was a user.

581
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,270
As far as we know,he isn't.

582
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,650
You know my brother was so high once he
went right through a plate glass window.

583
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,570
There was blood everywhere,but,jimmy,he
didn't even know he was hurt.

584
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,560
That's what this stuff did to him.

585
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,890
Do you want me to cut it for you?

586
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,700
It's not for me.It's for him.

587
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,900
I don't touch that crap!

588
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,100
Okay,we just sell!We don't use.

589
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,030
Hey,if it's good enough for my
brother,it's good enough for yours!

590
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,860
Get down!

591
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,910
Okay,okay!All right,all right!

592
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,150
You want him to do a line?

593
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,770
That's cool,man.

594
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,030
No,not a line.

595
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,520
All of it.

596
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,370
That'll kill him.

597
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,190
Okay.

598
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:19,880
No!

599
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,220
let him go,man!Let him go,man!

600
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,430
Let him go!

601
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,200
Robert cooper!

602
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,230
This is sergeant gregory parker with
the police strategic response unit.

603
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:36,430
I need you to put down your weapon and exit
through the front door of the house immediately!

604
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,130
come on!Do it!

605
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,730
Robert cooper!

606
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,040
There's cops all around us,man!

607
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,190
You're done!

608
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,570
Now let him go and give yourself up!

609
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,820
Shut up!

610
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,520
Mr. Cooper,i need you to stay
away from the front windows

611
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,100
We'll be breaking the glass
and sending a phone in.

612
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,390
I need you to pick it up
and talk to me,all right?

613
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,100
Just a little privacy.

614
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,390
Just you and me.

615
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,350
I think they want you to answer it.

616
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,490
I said shut up!

617
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,040
Answer the damn phone!

618
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,540
Well,he's not picking
up,but at least we got ears.

619
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,230
Come on,cooper.

620
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,270
If you were gonna shoot
us,you'd have done it by now.

621
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,210
Grady... We didn't... We
didn't kill your brother,man.

622
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,460
Yes,you did!

623
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,120
He did it to himself.

624
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,240
He's escalating him.

625
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,220
We didn't force him to take drugs!

626
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,850
That was all on him!

627
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,060
He's trying to distract
him,throw him off his game.

628
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,670
You say you love your brother,why
didn't you stop him from using?

629
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,750
Shut up.

630
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,100
Maybe an intervention.

631
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,090
You better shut your mouth!

632
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,140
Immediate action,white door.

633
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,630
Go in now,now!

634
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,460
Everyone fall back!

635
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,240
Fall back!Fall back!

636
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,520
Status,status!

637
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,650
No harm.

638
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm good.

639
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,480
Coming to you.

640
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,990
I'm done listening.We're going in.

641
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,210
Immediate action.

642
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,760
I think he's trying to force our hand,

643
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,920
to get us to storm in and end this.

644
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,200
Okay,that makes sense.

645
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,470
That makes sense.

646
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,070
He's never shot to kill before.

647
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,510
He wants us to do it for him.

648
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,420
No one's dying today.

649
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,850
Sam,what do you got?

650
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,050
two entrances,living room.

651
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,580
Two bedrooms upstairs.

652
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,630
You got a basement?

653
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,820
Yeah.

654
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,780
Okay,where do the stairs lead?

655
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,500
Back entrance goes
straight into the basement.

656
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,210
Basement stairs go right up to
the kitchen into the living room.

657
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,500
Right to the target.

658
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,820
Looks like it.

659
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,990
All right.

660
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,110
Let's stack it up.Watch the windows.

661
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,510
Got it.

662
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,200
Wordy,you're on point.

663
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,670
Alpha team,move in.

664
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,470
don't speak!Do not speak!

665
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,170
Robert cooper!

666
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,550
Shoot him!

667
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,070
We're not here to hurt anyone!

668
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,030
No,shoot him!

669
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,010
He's gonna kill my brother!

670
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,810
Nobody's gonna get shot today,robert.

671
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,110
Oh,so now you show up?

672
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,750
All these years,begging for your
help while these guys take over.

673
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,170
I hear you,buddy.

674
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,250
I hear you.

675
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,720
I just need you to put that gun down.

676
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,000
They destroyed everything
that my father ever built!

677
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,900
We know what you lost,robert!

678
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,060
They killed my brother.

679
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,590
I'm gonna put my weapon
down so we n talk,okay?

680
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,390
Robert,my name is kevin wordsworth.

681
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,330
My friends call me wordy.

682
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,860
I loved your dad's store.

683
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:42,940
What?

684
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,030
Yeah.

685
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,710
Yeah,he had a rack of those
old dime-store westerns,

686
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,200
but nobody ever bought 'em.

687
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,640
He let me just hang out and read 'em.

688
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,070
He never kicked me out for not buying.

689
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,570
That's the kind of man he was.

690
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,770
What,you think that i don't
know that he was a good man?

691
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,530
He worked his hands to the bone!

692
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,620
And then these...
Low-lifes,they come along and...

693
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,870
Wordy,we've got cooper's
wife,patty,here with us.

694
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,410
She's gonna help us out.

695
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,310
Your wife is here,robert.

696
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,890
She's real worried about you.

697
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,180
No,no,no,no,i have to do this,all right?

698
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,850
I have to do this for my brother jimmy.

699
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,780
Listen,i loved jimmy,too,but i know
that he wouldn't want bobby to do this.

700
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,270
She's telling me that jimmy wouldn't
want you to throw your life away.

701
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,860
There is no life!

702
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,270
There is no life.

703
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,640
They took away anything
that ever mattered to me!

704
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,830
What about patty?

705
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,550
She's right here and she loves you.

706
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,180
She's better off without me.

707
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,410
No!

708
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,140
That's not true.

709
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,970
We were gonna start a family.

710
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,040
Patty's all about your future.

711
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,940
You were gonna have kids.

712
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,520
Robert... You want to
honour your brother's memory?

713
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,860
Start living again.

714
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,050
No one is better off without you.

715
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,160
It's not right.

716
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,970
It's not right!

717
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,320
They should pay for what they did!

718
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,490
I know.

719
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,640
Okay,that's why i became
a cop and not a cowboy.

720
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:17,390
I'll make sure... I'll make sure
they get what's coming to them.

721
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,880
But not like this.

722
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,420
Bob,put the down.

723
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,540
Come on,man.

724
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,520
We gotta do this the right way,coop.

725
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,470
Put the gun down.

726
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,070
Come on,please.

727
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,410
Let's do this together,huh?

728
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,240
You and me.

729
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,560
Come on.

730
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,670
Good.

731
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,240
All the way down.All the
way down on the ground.

732
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,470
Drop it,drop it.

733
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,760
Now,get down on your knees.

734
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,830
That's it. That's it.

735
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,910
Hands behind your head.

736
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,690
Good job.

737
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,130
Thank you!Thank you.

738
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:19,520
*you act like you wonder *

739
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,210
*if i know * *right from wrong *

740
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,770
*believe me *

741
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,530
*i understand *

742
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,810
i've been thinking.

743
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,820
You know,it's not like by
the middle of next month

744
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,050
they'll have found all
the international bad guys

745
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,770
and i'll have missed my chance.

746
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,240
A guy could stay pretty busy keeping
the peace in his own backyard.

747
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,630
*i am who i am *

748
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,510
*and i am haunted *by the things *

749
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,680
*that you're saying*

750
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,650
you did good in there. Thanks.

751
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,970
One good thing came out of all this.

752
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,360
Cooper kept them so busy...

753
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,310
They never had time to
get rid of the goods.

754
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,790
Looks like they're going
away for a long time.

755
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,460
So tonight at 8:00,or what?

756
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,750
Can i get a rain check on the barbecue?

757
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,490
I,uh,have some phone
calls i have to make.

758
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,610
No problem. Yeah?

759
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,810
I told 'em,michaelangelo scarlatti,

760
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,650
code name "spike," is
a disgrace to the force.

761
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,460
I mean he cracks under pressure.

762
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,560
He can't shoot his
way out of a paper bag.

763
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,340
He can't be trusted with sensitive
information on a surprise party,

764
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,610
let alone national security.

765
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,370
He can't type if his
life depended on it.

766
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,500
No,wait,that's what i wanted to say.

767
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,660
Boss,they were headhunting me.

768
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,940
Okay,no,it's not like i was-

769
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,840
i mean you get to see the
world,international intrigue.

770
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,750
Young guy like you,right?

771
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:02,390
Just when you make the
choice,spike,i will support it,okay?

772
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,720
Boss,need you outside.

773
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,070
I'm comin'.

774
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,250
Teni mi informato.

775
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,260
Keep you posted,boss.

776
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,340
*i'll try to defend our lives *

777
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,940
*i will try to defend*

778
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:25,620
*our lives *

779
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,550
*and you'll understand *

780
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,270
*that i won't let you down *

781
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,920
*hey, hey, hey, hey... *

782
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,290
wanna help me out?

783
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,360
*i am haunted by the things *

784
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,300
*that you're saying to me *

785
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,890
*and i try to defend *

786
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,960
* *

787
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:01,400
*i will try to defend our lives*
