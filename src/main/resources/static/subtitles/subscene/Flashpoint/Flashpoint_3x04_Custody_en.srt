Professional Or recreational?

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,260
A little of both.

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,420
Oh,yeah?

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,540
What happened?

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,870
There was an apartment
fire In high park.

22
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,660
Old building, So the thing
went up In about five minutes.

23
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,690
People were jumping
From their balconies.

24
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,060
It was a mess.

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,290
So i was bringing this kid Down from the third
floor, And that's when The stairs collapsed.

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,900
Barely made it out myself.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,970

- Jules: Sorry.

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,890
What was the recreational Part?

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,190
I got so pissed off That night, Threw
back a few shots And jumped on my bike.

31
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,760
Harley didn't make it, I did.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,400
You know, There's good plastic surgeons,
If you ever wanna Get rid of that.

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,370
Winnie: Team one,suit up.Suit up.

34
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,520
Gun call, Business
district, 2002 bay street.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,030
Nah,it's a good reminder
Not to be an idiot.

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,060
Yeah, Got four brothers for that.

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,420
Crowd: This is a mistake.Please.

38
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,780
You're not listening to me!

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,390
Lawyer: There's nothing
i can do, I swear to god!

40
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,300
I'm gonna give you...

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,980
One last chance!

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,260
Parker: I got it all, Thanks.

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,510
White male,late 30's.

44
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,480
Pulls a gun, Forces another
white male Into the building.

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,020
Did you get a location Inside?

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,040
Jules: They were seen in the
atrium, But beyond that, No idea.

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,520
- Ed: shots fired?
- Parker: not yet.

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,160
Uniforms cleared The first two
floors, But they don't have shields,

49
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,680
So,they backed off In
case the guy Went active.

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,090
All right, Let's see what spike's got.

51
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,630
Parker: Let's start talking
Before buddy takes it up A level.

52
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,490
Priority is on "who" And "where.

53
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,860
" Bonus points for "why"?

54
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,630
Parker: Okay,guys, We've got 12
floors, A dozen offices Per floor.

55
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,370
Sam?

56
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,930
That's a lot of window,
360 degree exposure.

57
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,040
Can't pick a sniper
perch Without more intel.

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,250
All right, Let's narrow it down.

59
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,950
Spike: Okay,i got the
building's Head of security.

60
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,940
His guys on these floors Have reported no
disturbances.He's awaiting instructions.

61
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,650
Ed: Okay,tell him to
lock down The elevators.

62
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,280
First priority is to immobilize
And contain the threat.

63
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,170
Spike: Copy that.

64
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,440
He came up this way.

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,800
He starts yelling At the other
guy Who was just coming out.

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,980
Then he pulls a gun And makes the other
guy Turn around And go back inside.

67
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,370
Parker: Do you know Either of the men?

68
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,420
Well,i seen the guy He was
pointing the gun at.The lawyer.

69
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,780
He's a lawyer?

70
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,230
I'm pretty sure he hangs out With
the other lawyers From the building.

71
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,400
What was he yelling?

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,090
Something about his kids.

73
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,330
Somebody took his kids.

74
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,580
Okay,and you said it seemed
Like they knew each other?

75
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,850
Parker: Do you know where His office is?

76
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,470
Well,it's not on The first floor; I
got my office there.I know everybody.

77
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,670
Above that?I really don't
have a clue,man.I'm sorry.

78
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,290
Any idea what kind Of weapon it
was?A handgun or a shotgun, Rifle...

79
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,050
A handgun.I just saw a flash Of silver?

80
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,770
I'm sorry, I don't know guns.

81
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,650
No-no,that's good, That helps.

82
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,030
Do you know the victim?

83
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,060
I don't know his name, But,yeah.

84
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,540
I think he has an
office In the building.

85
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,440
Any idea which office?

86
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,440
**********

87
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,730
Parker: Eddie.

88
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,210
Hostage may be a lawyer.

89
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,930
Ed: Okay,copy that,boss.

90
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,380

91
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,310

92
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,890
Law firms from here to
here, And here and here.

93
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,230
Jules: Hey,guys,my witness says
They seemed to know each other.

94
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,270
This is personal.Something
about losing His kids.

95
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,980
So,he's stressed.He's
just suffered a loss.

96
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,220
How stressed Do you have to
be To come after a lawyer?

97
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,220
So,what, The guy grabs the lawyer,
Takes him To his own office?

98
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,830
Or he grabs the guy And takes
him To the most convenient office.

99
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,150
Ed: All right, Until we learn
more, We'll do it the hard way.

100
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,850
We start at the tenth
floor, We work our way down.

101
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,160
Stealth entry.

102
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,300
Locate and evacuate
Any citizens at risk.

103
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,920
Leah: Sru.Come with me.

Donald, You need to calm down.

112
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,090
Don't you patronize

113
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,310
I will not lose them.I haven't come this far,
I haven't worked this hard Just to walk away.

114
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,160
Now start talking!

115
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,890
This guy sees this other guy, Like he's
waiting for him, Then he gets out of his car.

116
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,280
- He almost knocks me down.
- Which car?

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,320

Two males arguing.

124
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,240
Office of adam westfall, Room 612.

125
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,430
Door facing the atrium, Southwest.

126
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,420
Spike: Adam westfall.I'll track recent
cases And see what might have Triggered this.

127
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,660
Let's keep 'em contained.

128
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,260
Spike: Adam westfall.Specializes
in family law.Small office.

129
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,010
One employee: Amanda martin,paralegal.

130
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,060
Parker: She could be in the office
As well.She could be at risk.

131
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,510
Wordy,get eyes in.We may have a second
citizen In there.A possible hostage.

132
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,480
Maybe somebody injured Or hiding.

133
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,340
Wordy: Copy that.

134
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,810
Man: You know exactly What's going on.

135
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,190
Now that she's got 'em?

136
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,780
She takes 'em back to ireland, Her parents
help her out And i never see them again.

137
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,700
Well,that is not Going to happen!

138
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,380
The subject's telling him Now that she's got the
kids, She's taking them back To ireland to her parents;

139
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,640
He'll never see them again.

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,820
Spike: Checked with the uniforms, Amanda
martin's car Is in her space in the garage.

141
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,780
- A couple people Saw her at work today.
- Parker: Chances are she's inside.

142
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,140
She's a wild card.I
don't like wild cards.

143
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,400
Maybe we get lucky And
she's outside the building.

144
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,710
Boss,there's no way We can
go in 'Till we've located her.

145
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,330
Hey,spike, The subject's car is
registered To a donald mitchell.

146
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,810
Spike: Donald mitchell...Cross-ref

147
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,340
Oh,i get to say,bingo?

148
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,670
Parker: Please,don't say bingo.

149
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,040
Spike: Westfall was in court This morning
Representing a helen mitchell In a custody case.

150
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,860
He loses custody, Blames her lawyer.

151
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,630
Okay,see what you can
find out About the case.

152
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,810
Get an address on the
wife And send it to jules.

153
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,380
- Jules?
- On my way.

154
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,600
Snake cam's good to go.Let's
figure out Where to put it.

155
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,670
Spike,we need the schematic
For westfall's office?

156
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,140
Coming at you.

157
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,290
Sam: Two rooms.

158
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,230
Wordy: My guess, She's in the closet.

159
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,070
If she's hiding, Or even in there.

160
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,190
Parker: Well,we got uniforms
Checking the crowd for her.

161
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,910
You know, Nobody's found her yet.

162
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,270
Can we get a cam Into that closet?

163
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,060
Wordy: If i go in through The
outside wall.It's concrete.

164
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,710
- Might take a while.
- Fast is good.

165
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,920
Get eyes into the main office,
Then we'll focus on the closet.

166
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,680
- Copy that.
- Okay,quick and quiet.

167
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,440
Guys,as far as i can tell,
Mitchell's a solid citizen.

168
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,410

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,990
Because she loves those kids.

561
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,390

What feels good Is
working out a settlement.

566
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,030
Letting both parents See the kids.

567
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,980

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,450

Things will go A lot better
for you If you tell the truth.

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,750
She deserves better Than to be
a housekeeper For some guy who...

night,Expecting dinner The table.
