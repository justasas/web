1
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,710
<i>Here in the upstate,
things don't change much.</i>

2
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,880
<i>Fall means football season.</i>

3
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,830
<i>Being married to a coach</i>

4
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,380
<i>Means measuring things
mainly by wins and losses...</i>

5
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,100
<i>Except for that one year.</i>

6
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,140
<i>Jimmy Carter
declared that if elected</i>

7
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,970
<i>He would do everything possible</i>

8
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,720
<i>To clean up
the federal government.</i>

9
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,310
<i>In South Carolina weather,</i>

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,310
<i>Late night
and early morning low clouds...</i>

11
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,370
Come on,
let's go.

12
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,240
No, mom!

13
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,630
What's wrong with you, boy?

14
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,630
Get out of my way!

15
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,600
Damn!

16
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,380
Laird, son,

17
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,960
How many years
you been playing for me?

18
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,800
Two years, coach.

19
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,630
You want to make that three? Yes, sir.

20
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,820
I suggest you start
paying attention here.

21
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,770
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,360
We do things as a team,
gentlemen.

23
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,190
One player doesn't execute,

24
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,030
It's the difference
between six yards or six points.

25
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,610
Honeycutt,

26
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,070
What say
we do some up-downs,

27
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,950
As a team,

28
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,370
So we can further appreciate
that concept.

29
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,990
You heard the man!

30
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,540
Get them feet
chopping, now!

31
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,690
Get it up nice!

32
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,690
Get those knees up!

33
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,190
Get them legs going!

34
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,960
Get it up!

35
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,960
Get it up,
right now!

36
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,380
Come on!

37
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,370
Hit it.

38
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,340
Get them up!

39
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,720
Come on! Get them up!

40
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,940
Let's go. Come on, man.

41
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,440
Come on, now!

42
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,710
Hey, you.

43
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,130
Now, might any
of those xs and os

44
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,830
Be for me tonight?

45
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,190
How's it coming?

46
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,750
Almost done.

47
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,480
Mary Helen home yet?

48
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,620
Mary Helen's been in bed
for an hour, Harold.

49
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,200
You know,

50
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,790
Y'all do have a week

51
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,570
Before you actually
have to play this game, right?

52
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,710
Right.

53
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,210
I'll be right up.

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,300
Ah, the first "I'll be right up"
of the season.

55
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,630
<i>Ready! Set!</i>

56
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,380
<i>Hut!</i>

57
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,950
Let's go, now.

58
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,610
Team!

59
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,810
Full speed!

60
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,260
Live to the ball!

61
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,480
¶ goodbye, hard life ¶

62
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,490
Ready!

63
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,300
Blue, 24!

64
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,640
Set!

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,080
¶ goodbye, hard life ¶

66
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,860
¶ don't cry ¶

67
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,340
¶ would you let it ride? ¶

68
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,090
Hey, einstein.

69
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,170
Why don't you try
picking the ball up?

70
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,680
Yeah, you, dummy.

71
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,960
What, you deaf?

72
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,180
Yeah, pick it up.
There you go.

73
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,550
Throw it over here.

74
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,120
Come on, throw it.

75
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,970
¶ ride, ride, ride
let it ride ¶

76
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,770
¶ ride, ride, ride ¶

77
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,940
Hey, man, what are you doing?

78
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,020
Hey, coach.

79
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,440
He took our ball.

80
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,780
¶ let it ride ¶

81
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,230
Run it again!

82
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:06,380
¶ ride, ride, ride
let it ride ¶

83
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,920
See you tomorrow.

84
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,980
Okay, see you later,
Mary Helen.

85
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,540
Bye.

86
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,550
You're getting
home late.

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,270
Oh, hey, daddy.

88
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,690
I tried calling a couple times,
but the line was busy.

89
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,330
Your mama's asleep.

90
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,440
Oh, I'll talk to her
in the morning, okay?

91
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,750
All right.

92
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,670
Night.

93
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,450
Goodnight.

94
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,340
Heard Mary Helen
made varsity cheerleader.

95
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,510
She's really excited.

96
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,630
I'll bet.

97
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,680
I'll bet Linda
is too.

98
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,080
Yeah, I guess so.

99
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,580
Do it again!

100
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,770
One more time!

101
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,090
You got them
running something?

102
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,390
Hit it!

103
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,270
Come on, dope!

104
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,730
Hey, boy!

105
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,940
Watch this. Watch this.

106
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,780
Bring them in.

107
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,900
Gather up!

108
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,150
On the double!

109
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,320
Well, is someone
going to tell me

110
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,940
What's going on here?

111
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
How about it, Johnny?

112
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
Nobody move.

113
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,420
Oh, no, no, no, no.

114
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,440
I just want
to help you.

115
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,470
It's okay.

116
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,770
I'm just going
to cut the tape off you.

117
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,360
You've got
to hold still.

118
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,310
Just try to hold still, now.

119
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,750
You got to hold still for me.

120
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,830
Look at me.

121
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Hold still.

122
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,030
I'm not going
to hurt you.

123
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,150
Just hold still.

124
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,590
I don't want
to cut you.

125
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,120
My god.

126
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,620
It's all right.

127
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,840
Calm down
a little bit.

128
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,930
It's okay.

129
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,330
I got it.

130
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,430
Going to get you
out of this mess.

131
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,660
Okay, you're free.

132
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,650
Anybody got
anything to say?

133
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,240
Tell your folks

134
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,490
Practice is going to run late
tomorrow.

135
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,720
Mary Helen tells me

136
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,470
The cheerleading squad's
got itself, what,

137
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,420
Half-a-dozen new faces
this semester,

138
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,390
Isn't that right?

139
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,810
I also hear
the athletic director

140
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,930
Now has to take

141
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,010
The top spot
on the pyramid

142
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,050
At the pep rallies,

143
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,050
Isn't that right?

144
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,380
Harold,

145
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,820
What do you say
you stop by

146
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,240
And see what kind
of no-good

147
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Your daughter's
up to?

148
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,320
Yeah, sure.

149
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,580
You got a couple of phone calls,
daddy.

150
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,330
From who?

151
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,620
Bobby taggert's folks.

152
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,020
Frank Clay.

153
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,400
I wrote them down for you.

154
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,170
What'd you tell them?

155
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,210
That you'd call back.

156
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,180
Harold,
have you decided

157
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,040
What you're going to do
about these boys?

158
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,680
Not yet.

159
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,850
Well, I'm sure most of them

160
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,040
Have never done
anything like this before.

161
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,770
You didn't see the look
on this young man's face, Linda.

162
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,390
He was terrified.

163
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,940
Coach Jones?

164
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,940
Go on. Good idea.

165
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,080
Might I have

166
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,960
A minute
of your time,

167
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,900
Please, sir?

168
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,920
Y'all, excuse me.

169
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,500
Anybody ever
said no to you on that,

170
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,050
Principal daniels?

171
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,620
Nobody still working here.

172
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,890
He scores.

173
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,630
What can I
do for you?

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,840
I hear we had
an incident

175
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,130
Yesterday.

176
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,600
Yes, ma'am, we did.

177
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,150
You taking
care of it?

178
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,190
Well, let's just say

179
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,020
Today's practice
won't be

180
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,560
The shortest one
we've ever had.

181
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,410
Good. Good.

182
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,190
You know, Harold,

183
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,410
That boy has been
rolling by here

184
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,160
For a long time now,

185
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,280
Minding his
own business.

186
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,500
Never caused any
problem for anybody.

187
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,670
I need you all to
keep it that way.

188
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,830
I appreciate it.

189
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,830
No, I don't want
the football.

190
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,530
I just want
to tell you

191
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm sorry about what happened.

192
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,970
I thought
you needed

193
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,540
To hear that
from someone.

194
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,890
No, I don't want
the football.

195
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,880
You keep it.

196
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,480
Why don't you bring it
by practice later?

197
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,150
I'll find you
something to do.

198
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,180
Maybe you can
help us out.

199
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,530
Nothing more
is going to happen, son.

200
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,560
I promise you.

201
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,900
See you later.

202
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,620
All right?

203
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,760
All right,
the nine of you.

204
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,440
You know
who you are.

205
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,260
Get on down there.

206
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,720
Take your
shoulder pads off.

207
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,200
Line up
on the chalk.

208
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,270
Let's go.
Hustle up!

209
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,290
Well, what do you
want to do?

210
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,080
Run them.

211
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,210
How long?

212
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,000
Till I say stop.

213
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,060
On the line, now!

214
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,340
Where you're
going to be.

215
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,730
Ready!

216
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,270
All the way to the line, coach.

217
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,080
Don't quit on me now!

218
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,670
Don't you quit on me!

219
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,920
All the way through that line!

220
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,000
All the way through!

221
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
Hi.

222
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,140
Hey.

223
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,510
Long day?

224
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,510
Yeah.

225
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,230
How was yours?

226
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,930
Long.

227
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,410
So the report is
that Mary Helen

228
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,570
Got off to
a great start

229
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,770
In lit class,

230
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
But she's
struggling a bit

231
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,190
With the math.

232
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,250
Well, the lit part sounds good.

233
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,830
Come on, Harold.

234
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,250
It's bad enough when
a parent misses

235
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,070
A parent-teacher conference,

236
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,040
But it's worse still
when the parent's a teacher.

237
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,070
If the parent's a teacher,
he knows how his kid's doing.

238
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,960
He doesn't need a conference
to tell him that.

239
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,250
What?

240
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,030
Please just tell me
that you forgot to go.

241
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,420
Come on, now.

242
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,550
You know I had to deal
with those boys.

243
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,090
Oh, those boys.

244
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,970
Can't you just make room

245
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,390
For your daughter
and those boys?

246
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Don't lecture me,

247
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,090
All right?

248
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,450
I'll go see ms. Marks tomorrow,
if it'll make you feel better.

249
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,980
Make me feel better?

250
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,180
This is not about me.

251
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,480
She's a junior,
Harold.

252
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,460
I mean,
she's got this year and next,

253
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,280
And then she's gone.

254
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,640
Go!

255
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,390
Y'all ready?

256
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,390
Yes, sir!

257
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,290
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

258
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,150
I want you
to close your eyes for a minute.

259
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,270
I want you
to listen.

260
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,970
You hear that?

261
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,900
I want you
to imagine

262
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,520
What that's going to sound like

263
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,570
After we've all
done our job tonight...

264
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,000
And then...

265
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,950
I want you to imagine
what that's going to feel like.

266
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,980
I want you

267
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,370
To picture your man

268
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,040
Right across from you.

269
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,040
You see him?

270
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,660
You make the effort
on every play,

271
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,290
You're going to beat them.

272
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,260
You play smart,
you're going to outthink them.

273
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,180
You play with heart
and character

274
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,850
And give your teammates
everything you've got

275
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,520
On every single
play out there,

276
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,970
You can walk off
the field tonight

277
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,010
Calling yourselves
a football team.

278
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,340
Okay.

279
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,260
Let's play
with Hanna pride

280
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,450
And never stop
believing in each other.

281
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,950
You win your battles,

282
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,120
We'll win our war.

283
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,740
What say let's
have some fun

284
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,040
And get it done.

285
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,330
<i>Your Hanna yellow jackets!</i>

286
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,340
Let's go, jackets!

287
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,220
<i>The kickoff is high and deep</i>

288
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,390
<i>And sends
the jackets' Johnny Clay</i>

289
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,720
<i>Back near the goal line.</i>

290
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,230
<i>Johnny Clay,</i>

291
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,710
<i>Behind a convoy
of Hanna blockers,</i>

292
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,230
<i>Heads up the right sideline.</i>

293
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,380
Go! Go!

294
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,270
Get up there!

295
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,490
<i>Finally knocked out of bounds
at the 42-yard line.</i>

296
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,990
Throw right, 63 flag.

297
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,100
Come on. Go.

298
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,560
Come on!

299
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,820
<i>First and 10 for the jackets.</i>

300
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,690
<i>Marcum back to pass.</i>

301
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,280
<i>Finds hawkins in the right flat
for another jacket first down.</i>

302
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,750
Come on. Get over here.
Come on. Come on.

303
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,230
36 crossbuck.

304
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,290
Look, once you
get that ball, son,

305
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,750
I don't want
to see nothing

306
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,120
But the back
of your jersey.

307
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,040
All right.
Get out there.

308
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,510
<i>The handoff is to Clay.
Finds a big hole.</i>

309
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,080
<i>Now cuts outside.</i>

310
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,100
<i>Beats one tackler...</i>

311
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,050
<i>And another.</i>

312
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,080
Get upfield, son.

313
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,250
Turn it on!

314
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,850
<i>He may go all the way.</i>

315
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,690
<i>Touchdown, Hanna!</i>

316
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,520
Yeah! All right.

317
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,640
<i>Johnny Clay with a 30-yard run
gives the jackets the lead</i>

318
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,280
<i>With less than two minutes
to play.</i>

319
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,280
Yeah!

320
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,480
Yeah!

321
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,230
That's a 30-yard
run, son!

322
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,120
That's our
ball game!

323
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,460
Evening, fellas.

324
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,510
Hey.
Hey, coach.

325
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,130
Harold.
Honeycutt.

326
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,730
Del. Don.

327
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,400
Kurt. Dennis.

328
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,270
Just brewed that pot
10 minutes ago, coach.

329
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,860
Got yourself
the first cup,

330
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,910
Right there.

331
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,780
All right.

332
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,320
Well...

333
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,040
Didn't exactly thump them,

334
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,290
But it wasn't too bad

335
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,620
As far as
season openers go.

336
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,090
Frank,
your boy, Johnny,

337
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,330
Had himself
a heck of a run there.

338
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,800
Just give him the ball.

339
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,800
He'll make
a smart man out of you.

340
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,270
Did notice
a few things

341
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,330
We need to work on.

342
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,020
Well, coach,

343
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,970
You reckon these are the boys
going to take us back to state?

344
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,890
Come on, clive.

345
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,610
Little early
for that kind of talk, isn't it?

346
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,140
I hear easley

347
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,450
Has a pretty decent
crop of speed this year.

348
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,060
Well, I guess we'll
see about that next week,

349
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,150
Won't we?

350
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,530
Do you think
you might want

351
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,780
To throw the ball
a little more?

352
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,120
I think
about a lot of things, Irv.

353
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,520
Now, listen, boys,

354
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,040
The last thing
coach here needs

355
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,410
Is us asking him
a slew of questions,

356
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,530
Especially after the way
he got those young men to play

357
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,290
In the fourth quarter.

358
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,030
We got them revved up
a little bit, didn't we?

359
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,210
So how do you plan

360
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,120
On beating
those easley boys

361
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,330
Come Friday night?

362
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,500
Well, Frank,

363
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,140
If I was to
tell you that,

364
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,090
Y'all wouldn't have
a thing to talk about

365
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,560
All week, would you?

366
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,810
Boy, that's a good cup tonight,
Del.

367
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,100
Thank you.

368
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,350
Come on,
turn it up!

369
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,490
Turn it up!
Turn it up!

370
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,610
Good job!

371
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,250
Hey, honeycutt.

372
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,370
Yeah?

373
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,090
See that young man over there?

374
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,620
Yeah.

375
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,260
What do you
figure he wants?

376
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,960
I don't know.

377
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,380
Come on, spaulding!

378
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,580
Bring it
around there!

379
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,960
I think maybe he's thirsty.

380
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,750
Go on.

381
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,030
All right. Five minutes.

382
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,230
Get yourselves a drink.
Get on special teams.

383
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,910
How you doing?

384
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,580
Yeah, you.

385
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,710
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

386
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,830
It's all right.

387
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,380
Settle down, now.

388
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,960
I ain't going to give you a hug
or nothing.

389
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,300
Just got a little water here.

390
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,580
See?

391
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,450
I'm dropping
something off here.

392
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,450
Little something
from coach Jones.

393
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,630
Got a name, son?

394
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,650
You ain't going to talk to me,
are you?

395
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,680
All right.

396
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,020
Go ahead.

397
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,180
Go on, give it a squeeze.

398
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,190
Set! Hut!

399
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,450
Good job. Good job, justin.

400
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,170
All right, bring it in!

401
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,720
Hi.

402
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,770
Glad you came by.

403
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,700
Thank you.

404
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,020
What's your name?

405
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,740
Why don't you come on in?

406
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,630
I got some, uh...

407
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,830
Got some hamburgers
coming.

408
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,500
Get your buggy.
Come on in.

409
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,480
Really good burgers.

410
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,260
Oh, you found
some music you like.

411
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,720
Good.

412
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,720
<i>¶ sha la la la la la la ¶</i>

413
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,220
Hey, look who's here.

414
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,360
No ketchup, no onion.

415
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,650
Thank you.

416
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,730
He tell you
his name yet?

417
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,770
He doesn't
talk too much,

418
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,650
But he's sure
taken a liking

419
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,120
To that radio
of yours.

420
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,160
Radio.

421
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,210
Radio?

422
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,170
You know,
it's just sitting there.

423
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,420
You can have it,

424
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,470
As far as
I'm concerned.

425
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,970
Hey, you hear that?

426
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,730
Radio?

427
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,010
Coach honeycutt says

428
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,400
You can take that
home with you,

429
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,630
If you like.

430
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,950
Hey, are you hungry?

431
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,350
Would you like
a hambu...

432
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,070
You going to
want something

433
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,490
To wash it
down with too?

434
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,360
Root beer? Coke?

435
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,250
Coke.

436
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,480
Man knows
what he wants.

437
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,820
Coke, it is.

438
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,460
<i>¶ yeah, baby ¶</i>

439
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,990
<i>¶ oh, make me happy, baby ¶</i>

440
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,100
Well...

441
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,780
Which way's home, radio?

442
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,300
<i>¶ who's that lady? ¶</i>

443
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,090
<i>¶ beautiful lady ¶</i>

444
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,970
<i>¶ who's that lady? ¶</i>

445
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,560
You know, there's
nothing wrong

446
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,090
With a good
country station...

447
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,650
<i>¶ real fine lady ¶</i>

448
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,900
But I can get used
to this too I guess.

449
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,650
<i>¶ hear me calling out ¶</i>

450
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,070
<i>¶ 'cause that's all
that I can do ¶</i>

451
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,390
<i>¶ your eyes tell me to pursue ¶</i>

452
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,410
<i>¶ but you say, look, yeah
but don't touch ¶</i>

453
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,060
You know,
the boys call me coach Jones.

454
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,250
Coach Jones.

455
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,750
You can call me
what you like

456
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,120
When you get
around to it.

457
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,870
All right?

458
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,400
<i>¶ sexy lady ¶</i>

459
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,340
<i>¶ who's that lady? ¶</i>

460
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,120
<i>¶ beautiful lady ¶</i>

461
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,910
<i>¶ who's that lady? ¶</i>

462
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,180
<i>¶ real fine lady ¶</i>

463
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,710
<i>¶ who's that lady? ¶</i>

464
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,460
<i>¶ I would dance upon a string ¶</i>

465
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,920
<i>¶ any gift she'd want
I'd bring ¶</i>

466
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,800
<i>¶ I would give her anything ¶</i>

467
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,930
Now, I hope you can

468
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,260
Come by practice tomorrow.
All right?

469
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,310
The same time.
All right?

470
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,270
See you then, okay?

471
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,080
Afternoon, ma'am.

472
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,410
I'm Harold Jones.

473
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,880
I coach the football team
over at Hanna high.

474
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,220
I was just...

475
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,060
Giving your boy a ride home.

476
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,180
Come on in now, baby.

477
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,920
Hey.

478
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,460
Hello.

479
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,510
Yeah.
Look.

480
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,180
I see

481
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,380
You got yourself
another one.

482
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,160
Oh, look at that.

483
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,800
You get that
from him?

484
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,050
Yeah.

485
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,440
Coach Jones.

486
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,470
Yeah.

487
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,010
Look at that one.

488
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,810
He a nice man?

489
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,030
Yeah.

490
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,870
Good.

491
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,370
I think it's time

492
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,370
You got yourself
washed up for dinner.

493
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,700
You hungry?

494
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,960
Yeah.

495
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,620
I made you
some fried bread.

496
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,860
All right.

497
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,960
Get yourself

498
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,080
Washed up
for dinner.

499
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,840
Set! Hut!

500
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,170
Get in there!

501
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,810
Bring it in!

502
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,390
Come on, hustle up.
Let's go.

503
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,760
Come on, hustle up!

504
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,930
Bring it in.

505
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,180
Good job. Good job.

506
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,570
Good practice, men.

507
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,720
We've got a lot
to think about

508
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,150
This week.

509
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,240
Easley's got a ton of speed.

510
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,730
Defense, containment.

511
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,580
We've got to keep them
from getting outside.

512
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,000
Offense, ball control.

513
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,530
We're going to
grind it out.

514
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,200
We've got to
keep their offense

515
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,200
Off the field.

516
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,250
Now, there's one other thing.

517
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,170
See the young man over there?

518
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,010
Believe some of you
already know him.

519
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,410
He goes by radio,

520
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,050
And he's going to
be helping us out

521
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,050
For a while,

522
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,270
And are not going
to have a problem with that.

523
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,090
No, sir.

524
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,270
Call it up, danny.

525
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,190
One, two, three!

526
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,810
Beat easley!

527
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,290
What's he doing?

528
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,870
That's it.

529
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,410
That's it,
get your knees up.

530
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,460
Look at him
out there.

531
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,130
That one! That one!
That one! That one!

532
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,950
Whoops.

533
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,500
Careful.

534
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,450
Sorry.

535
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,790
I'm sorry, Johnny.

536
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,930
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Johnny.

537
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,340
I'm sorry.
You okay?

538
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,340
Fine.

539
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,480
What the hell
is going on out there?

540
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,030
<i>The yellow jackets
still looking to get on track.</i>

541
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,980
<i>Marcum back to pass.</i>

542
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,030
<i>Intercepted!</i>

543
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,090
¶ hand me down my walkin' cane ¶

544
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,760
¶ hand me down my hat ¶

545
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,090
¶ hurry now and don't be late ¶

546
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,880
¶ 'cause we ain't
got time to chat ¶

547
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,680
¶ you and me, we're goin' out ¶

548
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,770
¶ to catch the latest sound ¶

549
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,520
¶ guaranteed to blow your mind ¶

550
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,140
¶ so high you won't come down ¶

551
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,860
¶ hey, y'all, prepare yourself ¶

552
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,030
Whoa!

553
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,010
¶ you've never heard a sound ¶

554
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,450
¶ like the rubberband man ¶

555
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,400
¶ you're bound to lose control ¶

556
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,150
¶ when the rubberband
starts to jam ¶

557
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,180
Come on! Come on!

558
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,550
Good job.

559
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,970
Don't quit! Don't quit!
Don't quit! Don't quit!

560
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,720
¶ I was so surprised
I was hypnotized ¶

561
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,720
¶ by the sound
this cat's puttin' down ¶

562
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,540
¶ when I saw
this short, fat guy ¶

563
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,060
¶ stretch a band
between his toes ¶

564
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,600
¶ hey, I laughed so hard
'cause the man got down ¶

565
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,270
¶ when he finally
reached his goal ¶

566
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,680
¶ hey, y'all, prepare yourself ¶

567
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,320
¶ for the rubberband man ¶

568
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,690
¶ you never heard a sound ¶

569
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,520
¶ like the rubberband man ¶

570
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,990
¶ you're bound to lose control ¶

571
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,700
¶ when the rubberband
starts to jam ¶

572
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,280
That was a good one.
I liked that one.

573
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,420
Radio!

574
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,840
Hi, everybody.

575
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,120
Hi, everybody.
Hi, everybody.

576
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,720
Quite a show you put on
out there tonight, coach.

577
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,380
Just wondering if you were
running a football program

578
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,470
Or a social club.

579
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,830
Radio, I need to talk
to your mama.

580
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,880
That okay?

581
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,250
She right there.

582
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,840
Hi, mama.

583
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,170
Hey, baby.

584
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,120
There's a sandwich in there
for you.

585
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,390
Oh. Okay.

586
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,010
I'll be in there directly.

587
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,010
Okay, mama.

588
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,560
Ma'am.

589
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,320
Hey.

590
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,690
I was wondering

591
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,910
If we might carry your son
on up to wade hampton tomorrow

592
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,070
On the team bus.

593
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,860
Got us a football game.

594
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,310
Well, what your boys
done to my son

595
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,950
Was wrong, coach,

596
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,980
But I'm not looking for you
to make up for it.

597
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,170
The boys are taking to him
real good.

598
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,290
They're still boys,
now, ain't they?

599
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,710
I'll keep a good eye on him.

600
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,130
I guess it's all right with me.

601
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,380
I don't mean
to pry, ma'am,

602
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,600
But, ...

603
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,120
I was hoping, ...

604
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,140
I might be able
to ask you

605
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,060
What exactly
is wrong with him.

606
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,450
Well, the doctors never could
give me a name for it.

607
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,860
Say he the same
as everybody else,

608
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,730
Just a little slower than most.

609
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,570
I got an older boy, walter.

610
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,070
He's fine and all.

611
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,320
And their daddy?

612
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,080
He died a while back.

613
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,250
I'm sorry.

614
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,890
You got your hands full.

615
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,890
Well, they got me
working 10 hours a day

616
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,140
At the hospital,

617
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,890
Some days more,

618
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,430
So I'm wondering where he's at
half the time

619
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,100
And worrying all the time,

620
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,850
Because I figure

621
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,850
They're only going to need
one excuse to put him away.

622
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,740
James is a good boy, coach.

623
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,060
He got himself a good heart.

624
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,200
Most folks just don't
take the time to see it,

625
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,280
Is all.

626
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,920
James.

627
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,000
James Robert Kennedy.

628
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,120
Thank you, ma'am.

629
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,970
No, he is not
getting on that bus.

630
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,630
Harold, he is not a student.

631
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,750
You don't even know
how old he is.

632
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:00,060
Look, he has a handicap
we know nothing about,

633
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,530
And what if he has

634
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,640
Some kind
of a seizure

635
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,190
Or something?

636
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,980
He's not the one
who's going to have the seizure.

637
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,070
This has got nothing to do
with any of that.

638
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,230
If you are suggesting
that I am overly concerned

639
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,040
About my students
being in the company

640
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,270
Of a severely handicapped
black man,

641
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,710
I assure you that I am,

642
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,120
But my concern

643
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,960
Is not necessarily
for my students.

644
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,550
I'm not so sure we're trying
to help somebody here,

645
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,130
Or whether he's being used

646
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,450
As nothing more
than a glorified mascot.

647
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,260
You know me a hell of a lot
better than that.

648
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,230
Put your
game face on.

649
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,650
Wipe your smile
off your faces.

650
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,490
Start thinking
about football.

651
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,490
Coach Jones!

652
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,490
Hey, radio.

653
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,640
It raining hard.

654
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,660
Radio...

655
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,690
Going to be
wet out there.

656
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,660
Yeah, it sure is.

657
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,810
Listen,

658
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,310
We're not going
to be able

659
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,280
To take you
on the bus today.

660
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,000
Some folks,

661
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,320
They don't think
it's a good idea.

662
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,650
They just don't understand yet,
but they're going to catch on.

663
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,120
Believe me.

664
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,460
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,830
I'm really sorry.

666
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,260
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

667
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,960
<i>And in local sports,</i>

668
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,370
<i>Hanna's yellow jackets
travel to wade hampton tonight.</i>

669
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,160
<i>With a 4-4 record,</i>

670
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,860
<i>They'll need to win
both their remaining games</i>

671
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,210
<i>To keep their playoff hopes
alive.</i>

672
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,170
<i>Clock winding down
now in the fourth quarter.</i>

673
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,300
<i>The yellow jackets have trailed
all night long</i>

674
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,920
<i>But are now
within striking distance,</i>

675
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,010
<i>Trailing 14-13.</i>

676
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,400
<i>Danny marcum</i>

677
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,600
<i>Barks out
the signals.</i>

678
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,380
He's back to pass.

679
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,820
<i>Incomplete.</i>

680
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,000
<i>Second down, now.</i>

681
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,870
<i>Still time to mount
one last drive,</i>

682
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,830
<i>And there's the draw play.</i>

683
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,290
<i>Playing
up the middle,</i>

684
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,090
<i>To five, 10,
first down, jackets.</i>

685
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,040
<i>Jackets will go
for a field goal</i>

686
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,210
<i>To win it.</i>

687
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,830
<i>Less than
a minute to play.</i>

688
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,190
<i>Here's the snap.</i>

689
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,190
<i>The kick.</i>

690
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,780
<i>No good!</i>

691
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,310
<i>The jackets'
last-ditch efforts</i>

692
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,320
<i>Fall short.</i>

693
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,620
<i>Final score...</i>

694
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,370
<i>Wade hampton, 14,
Hanna, 13.</i>

695
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,620
Here, here.
Use a spoon.

696
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,170
There you go.

697
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,500
Let me get some
of these things

698
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,640
Out of your way.

699
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,790
All right.

700
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,090
Thank you, grace.

701
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,090
Which one
of those cobblers

702
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,060
You got today?

703
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,090
I got-

704
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,510
I'm not done.

705
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,430
Don't talk with your
mouth full, now.

706
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,820
Um, peach and blackberry.

707
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,250
Peach and blackberry.

708
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,240
What's it going to be, radio?

709
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,940
Both.

710
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,990
Give the man both.
I'd like some more coffee too,

711
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Please.

712
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,280
Yeah, I take both.

713
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,080
Radio, look at me
for a minute.

714
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,320
I want my pie.

715
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,500
You got some mustard
on your cheek.

716
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,950
I'll get it for you.

717
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,590
There you go.

718
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,790
Football season's
just about over.

719
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,800
You know that,
don't you?

720
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,830
One more game.

721
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,720
Yep. One more game.

722
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,220
You going to be
okay with that?

723
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,560
Where's my pie?

724
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,780
Don't worry,
they're coming.

725
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,960
She'll bring you your pie.

726
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,980
Don't worry about it.

727
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,030
I like both.

728
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,820
She's got your order.

729
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,650
Football.

730
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,190
I like football.

731
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,020
You know,
some of us felt pretty bad

732
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,190
About leaving you
off that bus last night.

733
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,860
I'm going to find a way
to make it up to you.

734
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,330
How you going to do that, coach?

735
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,540
<i>Your Hanna yellow jackets!</i>

736
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,600
Jackets!

737
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,890
Hey. We're having fun.

738
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,110
This is a good one.

739
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,950
<i>Nothing like archrival westside
to get jackets fans stirred up.</i>

740
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,500
<i>Winning this one</i>

741
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,240
<i>Would even Hanna's record
at 5-5,</i>

742
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,210
<i>And though a far cry
from early season hopes,</i>

743
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,070
<i>Salvage a measure of pride
for the home squad.</i>

744
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,550
Here we go.
Here we go.

745
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,100
All right, four right,
24 flank and reverse.

746
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,130
<i>Third and six on the 40.</i>

747
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,350
That was
a good one, coach.

748
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,100
That was
a good one.

749
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,600
Yeah. We'll see.

750
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,770
Ready!

751
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,020
That was a reverse!

752
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,090
Reverse!
Reverse!

753
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,030
Radio,
come back here.

754
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,110
Come back here.

755
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,150
What... He's telling the play!

756
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,100
<i>Westside defense
calling an audible,</i>

757
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,110
<i>Bringing in
both outside linebackers.</i>

758
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,070
Danny, check it off!
Reverse!

759
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,550
<i>Jones signaling for time,
but marcum doesn't hear him.</i>

760
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,740
<i>Marcum rolls right
and pitches it to hill</i>

761
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,740
<i>On a flank and reverse.</i>

762
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,660
<i>He is crushed in the backfield
and fumbles the ball,</i>

763
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,960
<i>And it's recovered by westside.</i>

764
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,780
Dadgum it!

765
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,620
Come on.

766
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,620
No wonder!
They knew the play.

767
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,550
They knew the play!

768
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,890
Defense,
get out there.

769
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,130
Radio, radio, radio.
Listen to me.

770
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,350
You can't let the other team
know what we're going to do.

771
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,100
How they know that, coach?

772
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,350
Tommy,
get out there!

773
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,570
Good god.

774
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,020
Set!

775
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,400
Hike!

776
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,190
<i>Snead back to pass
for westside.</i>

777
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,740
<i>It's broken up by bradley,</i>

778
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,160
<i>But a flag is thrown
on the jackets' cornerback.</i>

779
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
No!

780
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,110
Got him in the back, coach.

781
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,360
Are you kidding?

782
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,310
In the back.
You blew that call

783
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,780
And you know it.

784
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,150
I need you to move back.

785
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,420
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

786
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,950
That was a chickenshit call.

787
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:37,950
15 more!

788
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,260
Oh, come on!

789
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,120
<i>Another penalty on Jones.</i>

790
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,510
Chickenshit! Chickenshit!
Chickenshit! Chickenshit!

791
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,510
Chickenshit! Chickenshit!
Chickenshit! Chickenshit!

792
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,710
Radio!

793
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,850
Get him out of there,
honeycutt!

794
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,600
Get him back.

795
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,050
Unsportsmanlike conduct!

796
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,060
<i>Just called a third penalty
on the jackets' bench.</i>

797
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,940
It looks like a damn
train wreck down there.

798
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,060
Honeycutt, get him
off the field.

799
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,190
How many flags you got here?

800
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,480
You got any more flags?

801
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,010
Get him back!

802
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,030
<i>A total of 45 yards
now on the play.</i>

803
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,780
There goes
my evening.

804
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,820
Let's go, buddy.
Here we go.

805
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,080
Any chance
I can get the ball tonight?

806
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,630
Nobody speaks
in this room

807
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,220
Unless coach Jones
says he does.

808
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,830
Sit down, Clay.

809
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,010
There your ball.

810
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,710
Now that we got that
taken care of...

811
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:47,240
<i>Jackets trying to hold westside
here in the fourth quarter.</i>

812
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,830
<i>They've stiffened
here in the second half</i>

813
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,060
<i>And still trail by only four.</i>

814
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,660
<i>Here comes the jackets' blitz.</i>

815
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,830
He got him!
He got him!

816
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,000
He got him!

817
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,450
Go!!

818
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,870
<i>The ball
will go back to the jackets</i>

819
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,840
<i>With time for one last drive.</i>

820
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,340
¶ when the sun comes up
on a sleepy little town ¶

821
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,260
¶ down around san antone... ¶

822
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,300
Hut!

823
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,750
<i>Marcum keeps it.</i>

824
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,420
<i>Pitches to smalls.</i>

825
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,350
<i>Bounces off one tackler
and breaks free!</i>

826
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,390
<i>First down, jackets!</i>

827
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,310
Ford, come here.

828
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,560
Flanker right,
split left.

829
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,940
24 z post.

830
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,610
Get on your horse.

831
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,260
Hey, honeycutt,

832
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,730
I got a good feeling
about this one.

833
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,870
Good feeling. Good feeling.

834
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,600
Set!

835
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,160
Hut!

836
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,960
<i>Marcum fakes the handoff
and drops back to pass.</i>

837
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,940
<i>Looking long.</i>

838
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,410
<i>Mitchell's open!</i>

839
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,000
<i>Touchdown, yellow jackets!</i>

840
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,890
That was a good one!
That was a good one!

841
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,140
What'd I tell you?

842
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,890
<i>With less
than a minute to play,</i>

843
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,150
<i>Hanna has overtaken
rival westside</i>

844
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,960
<i>With a stunning
37-yard touchdown.</i>

845
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,570
Yeah!

846
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,770
That's the way
the game's

847
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,940
Supposed
to be played.

848
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,410
Good job.

849
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,740
All right.
I got it!

850
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,080
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

851
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,030
Settle down, now.
Listen up.

852
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,950
That was a great team effort
out there tonight.

853
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,590
Great comeback.

854
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,490
Y'all played your hearts out.

855
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,960
I'm proud of you. Good job.

856
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,830
Honeycutt.

857
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,130
For standing behind us
all season long,

858
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,680
Especially tonight,

859
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,050
The game ball...

860
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,050
Goes to radio.

861
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,850
Can you sign this?

862
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,350
Yeah, sure.

863
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,690
There you go.

864
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,790
Thanks.

865
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,740
Hi.
Hey.

866
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,710
How are you?

867
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,990
Much better now.

868
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,160
Yeah?

869
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,080
You want me to bring
this home tonight?

870
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,800
You only got
one of them?

871
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,050
I had a lot
to choose from,

872
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,030
Didn't I?

873
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,300
No kidding?

874
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,420
You going over
to the shop?

875
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,750
I suspect so.

876
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,390
Shouldn't be
too painful.

877
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,720
Well, don't forget to
bring some of that

878
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,370
Unsportsmanlike
conduct home.

879
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,810
All right.

880
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,680
Evening, fellas.

881
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,770
Harold.
Harold.

882
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,850
Irv. Clive.

883
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,690
Nice win tonight,
coach.

884
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,410
I'll make us
a fresh batch.

885
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,580
Well, this will be fine, Del.

886
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,170
Well, I know a 500 season
isn't what we all had in mind,

887
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,290
But I did
see some things tonight

888
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,260
I think we can build on.

889
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,340
The boys made some
good adjustments at halftime

890
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:55,300
And ol' danny marcum finally got
the offense moving a little bit.

891
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,630
He sure did.

892
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,250
He sure did,
coach.

893
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,390
I'm real proud of all the boys.

894
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,020
Always good to beat westside,

895
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,020
And it's nice
to win the last one.

896
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,260
Wasn't long ago

897
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,260
We were winning
most every one.

898
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,410
There something you need to say,

899
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,980
Frank?

900
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,480
Well, I think we got...

901
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,200
Too good a team

902
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,240
To be losing half our games.

903
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,300
Anybody else?

904
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,220
No.
No.

905
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,500
It's all right,
you can speak up.

906
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:38,960
Well, if nobody else
is going to say anything,

907
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,640
I sure as hell will.

908
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,650
You got yourself a distraction
needs dealing with.

909
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,900
A distraction?

910
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,900
Is that what you think radio is?

911
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,800
Well, you're damn right I do.

912
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,320
Come on, now, Frank.

913
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,150
You know, I think I'm going
to do us all a big favor

914
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,330
And let you all finish this one
on your own.

915
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,960
Coffee's been better, Del.

916
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,600
Sorry, coach.

917
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,310
Well, now you show up.

918
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,350
You chickenshit.

919
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,780
I figured I'd
just be in the way.

920
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,350
How'd it go?

921
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,710
That good, huh?

922
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,740
I'm afraid we've got

923
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,410
A disgruntled booster
on our hands.

924
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,580
Hmm.

925
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,380
Banker Frank?

926
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,580
Yeah, he says we got a problem

927
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,700
With radio
being on the sidelines.

928
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,710
What do you think?

929
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,200
I think that one's up to you.

930
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,890
How's the
basketball team

931
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,030
Looking?

932
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,880
Just fine,
long as Johnny stays healthy.

933
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,400
Why?

934
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:30,950
Oh, I just thought radio
might need something to do.

935
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,260
You know,
I reckon we could use some help.

936
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,540
Good.

937
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,590
I'll see you Monday.

938
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,920
Hey, what you
got now, boy?

939
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,690
Football.
Football.

940
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,860
A football?

941
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,280
Coach Jones
gave you that?

942
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,940
Yeah.

943
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,370
Wait a minute, now.

944
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,600
What's the matter?

945
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:11,070
We all done.

946
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,210
Oh, now...

947
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,490
We all knew

948
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,800
The season was going
to end sometime.

949
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,960
Yeah?

950
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,080
Yeah.
Yeah?

951
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,620
But look
what you got.

952
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,890
A football and
a sweatshirt

953
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,590
And lookee here.

954
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,260
Look at all of this.

955
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,630
Look at that.

956
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,810
That radio.

957
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,310
Yeah.

958
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,930
See?

959
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,270
Now, next fall's
going to be here

960
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,630
Before you know it.

961
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,940
Promise.

962
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,490
Now, give mama a hug.

963
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,160
Boy, what's that?

964
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,500
I want me a hug.

965
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,600
I'm always here for you, baby.

966
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,290

Hi, nicole.
Hi.

981
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,680
Coach Jones.

982
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,680
Well, good morning,
lou.

983
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,660
Good morning.

984
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,800
What brings you

985
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,350
To this neck
of the woods?

986
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,850
Seeing as you never
drop by my office,

987
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,100
I thought I'd
pop up for a visit.

988
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:47,470
And how is
everything?

989
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,560
Everything's fine.

990
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,840
Why?

991
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,220
A little bird told me

992
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:52,530
Mr. Kennedy's
been spending

993
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,340
Quite a bit of
time with you

994
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,480
Inside the building.

995
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:55,730
Yeah,
that's correct.

996
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,350
Do you see that as a problem?

997
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,530
Disrupting a football game
is one thing.

998
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,150
Disrupting
a classroom

999
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,150
Is a different
matter.

1000
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,900
Hmm?

1001
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,690
I want him with you
all the time.

1002
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,910
Okay?

1003
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,700
Yes, ma'am.

1004
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,550
...I-o.

1005
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,030
"radio,"

1006
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,300
And that's how
you spell it.

1007
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,840
Here, you want
to try it?

1008
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,640
You want to do it?

1009
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,840
Look. It's easy.

1010
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,430
You know, you just
take the chalk

1011
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,010
And it writes
right on there.

1012
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,070
Well, we don't have
to do it right now.

1013
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,690
Radio.

1014
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,160
Blueberry and pumpkin today.

1015
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:44,280
Pie, not cobbler.

1016
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:47,560
Both.

1017
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,010
<i>Coach Jones, you're needed in the office.</i>

1018
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:00,460
All right, everybody,
just keep working.

1019
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,740
Radio, I want you

1020
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,850
To keep everybody
under control

1021
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:03,910
While I'm gone, now.

1022
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,220
Keep an eye
on everything.

1023
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,310
No talking.

1024
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,090
No....

1025
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,390
Well, now,

1026
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,450
How long would you say
mr. Kennedy has been

1027
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,870
In an actual
classroom setting?

1028
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,990
Well, let's see, about a month.

1029
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,990
And the thinking behind that?

1030
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:30,960
Well, he was doing
fine with the team.

1031
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,580
I didn't see any harm in it.

1032
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,170
Look, mr. Tucker,
I know you've got a job to do

1033
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,800
But is...

1034
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,970
Me having radio in the classroom
really worth all this trouble?

1035
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,920
Well, that's
what the school board

1036
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,680
Would like to find out.

1037
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,100
This is a young man

1038
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,130
Who's been spending
his entire lifetime

1039
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,770
Wandering around all by himself
out on the streets.

1040
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,230
Which is quite different

1041
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,300
Than being
inside a public school.

1042
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,850
Wouldn't you agree?

1043
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,640
Yeah, well, that's the point,
isn't it?

1044
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,970
Mr. Tucker,

1045
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,490
I am well aware

1046
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,280
Of the liability risk
we are running here.

1047
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,280
Harold here will be
first to tell you,

1048
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:12,950
That my list of reservations
is longer than most.

1049
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,450
I'm sure
that's the case,

1050
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,290
But the fact of the matter is,

1051
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,260
None of us has any experience

1052
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,320
With having
a severely retarded man

1053
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,460
Wandering
the same halls

1054
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,830
As our students.

1055
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,000
The risk is enormous.

1056
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,460
Please keep that
in mind.

1057
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,430
I will.

1058
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:31,970
Ms. Daniels.

1059
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,840
Mr. Jones.

1060
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:37,010
Thank you,
mr. Tucker.

1061
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,010
Well,

1062
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,060
This is a hell of a position
you've put me in.

1063
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,200
Yeah, I suppose it is, lou,

1064
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,350
But radio's
not going to do anything.

1065
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,570
Harold...

1066
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,380
Why on earth are
you doing this?

1067
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,750
Same reason you are.

1068
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,130
Defense!

1069
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,340
Defense! Come on, let's go!

1070
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,210
How you doing?

1071
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,340
I'm good, I'm good.

1072
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,380
That's in.

1073
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:14,590
That's all right.

1074
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,180
Looks like radio's
doing okay.

1075
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,380
Long as there's
a ball.

1076
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,100
How you doing?

1077
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,850
Oh, hell, honeycutt,
you know me.

1078
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,240
Get near Christmas,

1079
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,220
And I start
counting down the days

1080
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,110
Till next season.

1081
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,990
Look at him,
honeycutt.

1082
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,410
Wasn't long ago

1083
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,750
You couldn't get
a word out of him.

1084
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,530
Yeah,

1085
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,080
I miss those days sometimes.

1086
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,740
Yeah, I got that one.

1087
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,010
I like that one.
Okay, here we go.

1088
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:50,300
All right,
bring it in.

1089
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,750
¶ have a holly
jolly Christmas ¶

1090
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,050
I'll get it.

1091
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,100
¶ it's the best time
of the year ¶

1092
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,250
Hello?

1093
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,220
<i>Hey, mrs. Jones.</i>

1094
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,440
It's radio.

1095
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,470
<i>Hi, radio.</i>

1096
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,020
Is coach Jones there?

1097
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,640
Just a minute, radio.
I'll get him.

1098
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,730
Harold!

1099
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,900
Mom?

1100
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:06,930
Have you seen
my red clip?

1101
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,030
Uh...

1102
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,270
<i>My red hair clip.</i>

1103
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,820
<i>Yes, yes,
on the washer.</i>

1104
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,820
<i>Harold!</i>

1105
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,240
Radio,

1106
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,740
Can I help you
with something?

1107
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,870
What pants I put on?

1108
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,040
Well, didn't your mama
lay out any clothes for you?

1109
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,630
No, she not here.

1110
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,780
<i>She working tonight.</i>

1111
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,080
Oh.

1112
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,720
Well, just pick something out
and put it on.

1113
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,780
<i>I'm sure
it'll look fine.</i>

1114
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,120
<i>It's a big night.</i>

1115
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,420
We're going to do
the Christmas tree up.

1116
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:32,450
<i>That right?</i>

1117
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,720
That's right,

1118
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,730
So just grab something
and put it on.

1119
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,480
Okay.

1120
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,760
<i>Harold?</i>

1121
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,480
Is that radio?

1122
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:47,320
How about this one?

1123
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,640
What?

1124
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:51,490
How about this one?

1125
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,080
Tell him
those look fine.

1126
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,530
Those look
fine, radio.

1127
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,640
Okay.

1128
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,750
Radio going to put them on.

1129
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:02,080
¶ joy to the world ¶

1130
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:05,150
¶ the savior reigns ¶

1131
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:09,880
¶ let men their songs employ ¶

1132
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,830
¶ while fields and floods ¶

1133
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,710
Put it right there.

1134
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,050
There.

1135
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,630
¶ repeat the sounding joy ¶

1136
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,440
Big radio in there, mrs. Jones.

1137
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,970
Big radio.

1138
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,640
I'm going to
get a cookie.

1139
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,360
All right, don't eat
too many, now.

1140
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,360
All right.

1141
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:29,400
Hey, hey, hey.

1142
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,730
Hey.

1143
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,370
Little something from us
for radio.

1144
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,850
Great, thanks a lot.

1145
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,950
Have a great one.
Merry Christmas.

1146
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,120
Merry Christmas.

1147
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,150
I'm going to take
these presents

1148
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,240
Over to radio's house.

1149
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,460
Of course you are.

1150
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,520
I'll go with carolyn.

1151
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,620
All right.

1152
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,030
Thanks.

1153
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,410
He sure cleaned up
this Christmas.

1154
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,500
Oh, yeah.

1155
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,630
Thank you.

1156
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,660
Merry Christmas
to you.

1157
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,750
Merry Christmas, coach.

1158
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:50,750
Del, have
a good one.

1159
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:51,870
Merry Christmas.

1160
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,340
Thank you, guys.

1161
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:55,840
Hey, daddy.

1162
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,140
Hi, honey.

1163
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,810
These are
from mr. Wagner's store.

1164
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,560
Thought radio
might be needing a few shirts.

1165
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,930
Great, thanks.

1166
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,180
This is nice,

1167
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,020
You getting folks
to help radio out.

1168
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,740
No shortage of people
feeling sorry for him.

1169
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,160
We're not asking people
to feel sorry for him.

1170
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,410
That's the last thing he needs.

1171
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,360
Okay.

1172
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,090
Look, Mary Helen...

1173
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,800
I know we haven't had
much chance to talk lately.

1174
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,630
There's been plenty of chances,
daddy.

1175
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,090
You just don't take any of them.

1176
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:50,030
It's all right.

1177
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:52,590
Radio needs
what you're doing

1178
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,030
More than I do.

1179
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,400
Look, we'll-

1180
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,570
Time to go,
coach Jones.

1181
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,770
Time to go.

1182
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,320
Merry Christmas,
Mary Helen.

1183
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:02,960
Merry Christmas, radio.

1184
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,570
Ooh, presents.

1185
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,280
A bunch of them.

1186
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:07,290
Yeah. So beautiful.

1187
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,880
Christmas!

1188
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,550
Goodnight, daddy.

1189
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,920
I'll see you at home.

1190
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,100
You all set to go?

1191
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,230
Merry Christmas,
coach.

1192
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,800
Merry Christmas,
radio.

1193
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:34,350
I can't wait till mama
see all these presents.

1194
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,800
Yeah, she's going
to be surprised, isn't she?

1195
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,310
I can't wait
to get home.

1196
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,240
This is so beautiful.

1197
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:40,990
I'll tell mama
about the tree.

1198
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,700
Think we'll be able to fit them
all in the house?

1199
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,610
No.

1200
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,750
Ooh. That's a big one.

1201
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,490
I can't wait to open these.

1202
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,120
These are all beautiful.

1203
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,160
Think it'd be all right
to open one tonight?

1204
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,660
Sure. Yeah.

1205
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,130
Which one I open?

1206
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,300
Here.
I got one right here for you.

1207
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,000
Open this one.

1208
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:02,470
Who that from, coach?

1209
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,770
Mrs. Jones,
Mary Helen, and me.

1210
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,500
It is?

1211
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,640
Okay.

1212
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:08,890
I hope you like it.

1213
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,030
It's a radio.

1214
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,030
Yeah.

1215
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,120
It's a radio.

1216
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,350
Turn it on, see if it works.

1217
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,990
<i>¶ whenever you call me ¶</i>

1218
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,210
It's working, coach.

1219
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,580
It's a good one.

1220
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,250
It's working on there.

1221
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,800
Whoo!

1222
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,220
Mama, it's working.

1223
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,670
Come on, mama. Come on, mama.

1224
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,630
Dance.

1225
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,300
Come on,
dance with me.

1226
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,920
All right,
all right.

1227
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,810
Whoo!

1228
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,260
This is a good one.
Come on, coach.

1229
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,430
Come on, it's Christmas.

1230
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,010
Come on, coach.

1231
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,570
All right, all right.

1232
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,220
<i>¶ now, I found out today ¶</i>

1233
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:55,900
Go, radio, go!

1234
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:59,070
<i>¶ that all the words
had slipped away ¶</i>

1235
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,190
<i>¶ but I know ¶</i>

1236
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,390
Whoo!
Go, radio, go!

1237
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,390
Dance. Whoo! Whoo!

1238
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,610
Whoo! Whoo!

1239
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,250
I like that one.

1240
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,570
Thank you, coach.

1241
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,950
You're welcome.
Merry Christmas.

1242
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,170
Thank you, coach.

1243
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,240
Merry Christmas.

1244
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,870
That's a good one.

1245
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,960
Oh, hush now.

1246
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,260
Lord, we ain't never seen
no Christmas like this.

1247
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,800
You cut a pretty
mean rug, there, coach.

1248
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,880
Oh, come on.

1249
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,610
That's where
he gets it.

1250
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:39,110
Well, he may not get
everything I try to teach him,

1251
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,950
But he did get that.

1252
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,600
The hospital's
got me working 16 straight,

1253
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,620
Right through Christmas day.

1254
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,160
At least tonight

1255
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,960
I get a little bit of holiday
with my boy.

1256
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,210
Good.

1257
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,630
You know, coach,

1258
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,210
It wasn't
that long ago

1259
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,830
I see you drive up
in that truck of yours

1260
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,590
And be wondering
why you doing what you doing.

1261
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:08,790
So why are you doing
what you're doing?

1262
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,230
I figure
it's the right thing to do.

1263
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,150
There's a whole lot out there
that's right.

1264
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,270
Don't mean we always do it.

1265
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,190
No, ma'am, it doesn't.

1266
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,280
James has been telling me

1267
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:33,980
Next year's team's
shaping up as a good one.

1268
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,450
Well, we're hoping.

1269
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,040
If all works out.

1270
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,460
You'd let me know
if he was a problem?

1271
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:45,010
He's no problem at all,
believe me.

1272
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,770
<i>How does it feel to be out
from behind bars, angels?</i>

1273
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,600
Good night, darling.

1274
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,170
<i>From all of us
to all of you,</i>

1275
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,870
<i>A very merry Christmas.</i>

1276
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,710
<i>Cloudy and cold today,
so stay by that fire</i>

No, no, no.
That's for me. That's for me.

1290

What's your name, son?

We got a sandwich

In case you're hungry.

1310
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,670
Oh, man, you see how much
they're paying dr. J.?

1311
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,600
How much?

1312
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,840
You're making this harder
than it has to be, son.

1313
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,560
Can't be for
one season.

1314
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,390
Ain't nobody makes
a half a million dollars

1315
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,560
For playing
basketball one year.

1316
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,360
Who you got
back there, kojak?

1317
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,950
I'm not sure yet.
He won't tell me his name.

1318
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,370
He ain't been here

Got hisself

Let's go see
who it is.

1321
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:00,990
When was the last time

1322
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,410
We had anybody here
on Christmas anyway?

1323
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:05,190
Hell, I don't know.

1324
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,880
Oh, shit.

That's dr. J.?
Ooh, that's a good one.

1331
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:32,990
Did you like that?

1332
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,610
Like that right there.

1333
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,160
He put the basket.

1334
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,730
<i>Well, it's the doctor's
team this year,</i>

1335
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,330
<i>No question
about it.</i>

1336
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,910
Why don't you wear
your hair like that.

1337
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,230
My hair

And got you
something to eat.

1362
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,600
Thought you might
be hungry.

1363
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,940
Oh. Okay.

That's right.

1376
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,300
You remember
what we talked about, now,

1377
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:24,020
About you staying close
to the teachers?

1378
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,720
Don't want you to go
wandering off on your own.

1379
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,670
That was a good thing
you did today, radio.

1380
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,440
Huh?

1381
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,980

01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
<i>With the hot rolls.</i>

1458
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,000
<i>And pear halves.</i>

1459
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,000
<i>And what?</i>

1460
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,320
Pear halves.

1461
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:56,340
We got pear halves.

1462
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:12,380
You ever seen
anything like that?

1463
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,300
Yeah.

1464
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,390
Hey, yo.

1465
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:19,440
Radio!

1466
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,640
Hey, how you doing, man?

1467
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:21,610
What's going on, bud?

1468
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,890
How you doing?

1469
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,180
Hey, where's honeycutt at,
man?

1470
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,010
Coach honeycutt,
he around?

1471
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:26,010
No, he gone.

1472
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,320
He's gone.

1473
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:28,320
All right.

1474
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:30,070
Well, hey, check it out,

1475
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,490
Coach dalrymple's got
a couple things next door

1476
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:32,070
She wants you
to come get.

1477
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,040
Huh?

1478
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,210
Mrs. Dalrymple.

1479
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,990
Don't worry, man, don't worry.

1480
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,030
It's just her. She's alone.

1481
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,030
Girls are gone.

1482
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,160
I- I can't do that.

1483
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:42,750
All right, man.
All right,

1484
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:44,300
But she's gonna be
real disappointed.

1485
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:45,670
You don't want
to let her down,

1486
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,220
Now, do you?

1487
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,970
Okay, radio.

1488
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,010
See you.

1489
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:50,920
Okay.

1490
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,480
Okay...

1491
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,590
Mrs. Dalrymple?

1492
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,540
Mrs. Dalrymple?

1493
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:33,080
Radio!

1494
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,720
You can't be in here.

1495
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,760
Bad radio. Bad radio.

1496
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,260
Coach Jones. Coach Jones.

1497
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:51,650
Coach Jones.
No, radio. No, radio. No.

1498
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,040
You know, it'd be one thing

1499
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,490
If you'd gone and done
something like this before

1500
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:58,940
On your own.

1501
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:05,500
Radio, listen to me.

1502
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,250
It's important
that you tell me

1503
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,630
Why you went in
the girls' locker room.

1504
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,170
Mrs. Dalrymple
needed me.

1505
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,170
What for?

1506
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,960
She wanted me
to pick up stuff.

1507
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,560
Did she ask you?

1508
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,510
Did she ask you?

1509
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,520
No.

1510
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,430
Who did?

1511
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:26,320
No.

1512
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:32,990
Radio, who asked you to go
in the girls' locker room?

1513
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:33,940
Who asked you?

1514
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,780
No.

1515
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:46,290
Well, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do here.

1516
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,320
Be mad at radio.

1517
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:50,630
Be mad at radio.

1518
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:02,390
You're willing
to do that?

1519
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:06,190
Take the blame
for someone else?

1520
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:13,980
You're a better
man than me.

1521
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,120
I'll say that
for you.

1522
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,700
Hey, Johnny,
what's up?

1523
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,390
I got a letter last
week from clemson.

1524
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,340
See, they know
I'm a junior,

1525
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,370
And they're looking at me
for a full ride after next year.

1526
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,930
That's great.

1527
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,340
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse me.

1528
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,090
I need to speak with mr. Clay

1529
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,150
For a minute.

1530
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:45,880
What's up,
coach Jones?

1531
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,820
It's one of those days
I wish I wasn't a teacher,

1532
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,480
So I could just
lay into you right now.

1533
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:50,520
What you talking about?

1534
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,240
What's gotten into you, huh?

1535
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,890
I thought you'd learned
something the past few months.

1536
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,080
I guess I was wrong.

1537
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,560
What are you
talking about?

1538
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,000
Don't saw a word
unless I tell you to,

1539
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,610
You understand me?

1540
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,530
Now, you might think
you're clear on this,

1541
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:07,950
Because honeycutt wasn't around,
but let me tell you something,

1542
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:08,950
This is my call.

1543
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:13,290
There's no way you're suiting up
tomorrow night.

1544
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,710
Right.

1545
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,580
What did you say?

1546
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,580
Coach Jones?

1547
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:21,250
Mr. Clay?

1548
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,630
What seems to be
the problem here?

1549
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,440
You hear the problem, ma'am.

1550
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,420
Young man,
students do not tell me

1551
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,760
What I do and do not hear.

1552
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,730
He said I can't play tomorrow.

1553
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,400
Is that what you're thinking,
coach Jones?

1554
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:36,560
That's what I'm saying.

1555
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,100
Well, then,

1556
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:40,150
Seeing that coach Jones
is the athletic director,

1557
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,370
I say you are not playing.

1558
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,240
Ma'am, this is westside.

1559
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:45,320
If we win, we're in first place.

1560
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,210
Well, that's all the more reason

1561
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,610
For you to cheer on
your teammates, isn't it?

1562
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:50,580
Anything else?

1563
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:54,800
Yeah, why don't you
tell your boy

1564
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,970
That I said thanks.

1565
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:00,170
Radio didn't sell you out, son.

1566
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,470
There are plenty of other people
willing to do that.

1567
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,150
Yes, sir.

1568
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,100
Well, I appreciate
your understanding.

1569
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,410
We'll talk soon.

1570
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:18,810
Thank you.

1571
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,650
That's the last of them.

1572
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,410
Did you talk to Mary Helen yet?

1573
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,670
She's fine.

1574
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,870
She knows
it wasn't radio's idea.

1575
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:31,200
Oh, Harold.

1576
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:34,920
Harold, you are
too close to this.

1577
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,790
It's not that
Johnny talked radio

1578
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,510
Into doing something,
it's that he did it.

1579
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,430
I mean, what if
it's something worse

1580
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,460
Next time?

1581
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,880
He'll know.

1582
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:45,430
Are you sure?

1583
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,300
Hell, I'm already under
a microscope anyway.

1584
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:50,170
I got a school to run,

1585
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,310
I have a thousand children
that I'm responsible for.

1586
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:54,560
I just-I need to know
where all this is going.

1587
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,480
I don't know, lou.

1588
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:59,310
Harold, that may not
be good enough anymore.

1589
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,620
No, I'm sorry.

1590
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,380
I've been trying to call,

1591
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,240
And I haven't gotten a hold
of either of them.

1592
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:14,700
I tried several
different places.

1593
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:15,830
I'm not sure-

1594
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,880
Oh, here he comes right now.

1595
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,000
I'll tell him.

1596
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,870
What's the matter?

1597
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,300
It's radio's mama, daddy.

1598
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,420
What happened?

1599
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:25,720
She had a heart attack.

1600
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,090
Oh, no.
Is she all right?

1601
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,310
No, she's gone.

1602
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:32,430
I was trying
to call you or mom,

1603
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,720
But I couldn't
reach anybody,

1604
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:36,480
And they're telling me

1605
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:39,650
That he won't come
out of his room.

1606
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:40,990
I don't know
what to do, daddy.

1607
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:41,940
All right.

1608
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,720
Put your coat on.

1609
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:46,730
He's just sitting
there in his room.

1610
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,610
You got it?

1611
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:03,040
Irv.

1612
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,760
Coach, thanks for coming.

1613
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,850
Walter's going to be here
in a few minutes.

1614
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,520
How's radio?

1615
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,750
He's pretty upset.

1616
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,720
Tore the place up
pretty good too.

1617
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:26,700
Radio?

1618
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:46,720
Radio...

1619
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,410
Radio...

1620
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,000
It's just me.
It's coach Jones.

1621
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,090
It's just coach.

1622
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,350
Coach.

1623
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,130
Coach...

1624
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,630
That's radio.

1625
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,800
Yeah.

1626
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:35,220
That's you.

1627
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:36,800
Radio
right there.

1628
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,450
There's mama-
there's mama there.

1629
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,790
Mama said we got-
we got good football this year.

1630
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:52,790
Yeah.

1631
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,240
That's what mama said.

1632
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,620
We got good-

1633
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,700
Radio, ain't nothing I can say

1634
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,200
Is gonna make you feel
any better.

1635
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,930
Mama.

1636
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,380
Your mama was a fine,
beautiful woman.

1637
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:18,150
She loved you
with all her heart,

1638
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,710
Didn't she?

1639
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,070
Oh, boy,
did she love you.

1640
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:25,100
She still does.

1641
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:27,320
She love
the radio.

1642
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,580
She said she's always gonna
be there for radio.

1643
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,840
James...

1644
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:44,420
Look at me.

1645
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:48,130
She will always be there
for you.

1646
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,410
All right? She will.

1647
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:51,630
You understand that?

1648
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:54,100
Always be with you,
inside,

1649
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,920
Right in your heart.
All right?

1650
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,030
We're gonna be
all right.

1651
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:13,790
Come here.

1652
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:16,540
Where's my mama?

1653
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,220
Hold on just a second.

1654
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,730
I want to tell you
something.

1655
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:42,400
Something I never told anybody.

1656
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,140
When I was about 12,
I had a paper route.

1657
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,610
Crack of dawn every day.

1658
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:56,610
Wasn't many houses
around here then,

1659
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:00,110
So I had to cover
quite a lot of territory,

1660
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:02,280
And I used to
cut through the woods

1661
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:05,150
On this little dirt road,

1662
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,790
And one morning,

1663
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,790
I was riding through there,

1664
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,510
And I heard this noise.

1665
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,670
Sounded like a rabbit
or something, you know,

1666
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,330
Caught in a trap,

1667
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:21,720
And then I realized
it was coming

1668
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,610
From one of these houses
set back up in there.

1669
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:28,110
I started-
kind of walked over there,

1670
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,810
And didn't seem like
anybody was home,

1671
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,350
So I walked on up.

1672
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,120
It had, you know, chicken wire
and barbed wire

1673
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,820
Around the bottom of it.

1674
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:41,570
I figure to keep
the critters out, you know?

1675
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:44,410
And then all of the sudden,

1676
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:47,700
I saw these fingers
coming through the wire,

1677
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:51,630
And I put my bike down

1678
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,000
And got down
on my hands and knees,

1679
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:56,590
And I...
And I looked under there,

1680
01:22:56,670 --> 01:23:00,640
And there was this boy
about my age.

1681
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:03,310
I don't know
what was wrong with him.

1682
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,400
Something was.

1683
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,050
They used to keep him
under there,

1684
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:13,690
And I...
I looked right at him.

1685
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,390
You know, he looked back at me.

1686
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:20,160
We just sat there

1687
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,160
Staring at each other
for a while.

1688
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:30,870
I ran that route
for two years, Mary Helen...

1689
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:40,130
And I never did a thing.

1690
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,450
I just wanted you
to know that.

1691
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,730
Thanks, daddy.

1692
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:24,390
How long
before he comes back?

1693
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:25,840
I'm hoping tomorrow.

1694
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,650
His brother walter's
moved in with him.

1695
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:28,900
Honeycutt says

1696
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,930
He let loose
on that house

1697
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:30,970
Pretty good.

1698
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,230
Yeah.

1699
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,680
Says he's not
the only one

1700
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,800
That knows about it
either.

1701
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:36,470
The man had just
lost his mother, lou.

1702
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,240
I didn't ask why

1703
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:39,820
He took a swing
at his wall.

1704
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,440
I just asked you
who knew about it.

1705
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:43,810
Well, why are you
asking me that?

1706
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:49,750
Our friend from the board
is back.

1707
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:50,670
He wants to see you.

1708
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,320
With his mama gone,
it's all different.

1709
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:57,210
Every bit of it.

1710
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:59,880
Good luck.

1711
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,130
Mr. Jones,
in the last month or so,

1712
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:07,130
How much time would you say
mr. Kennedy has spent alone?

1713
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,350
Uh, during the day, at least.

1714
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,770
Mr. Jones?

1715
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,890
Past few weeks?

1716
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,560
Everybody's been keeping
a pretty steady eye on him.

1717
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:21,900
So we talking an hour a day?
Or two?

1718
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,450
An hour, maybe.

1719
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,120
Well, it could be a half-hour.

1720
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:28,690
Well...

1721
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,290
As you may
have guessed,

1722
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,990
The board
has received reports

1723
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,130
Of mr. Kennedy's rather
inconsistent behavior.

1724
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,050
What kind
of reports?

1725
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,200
From who?

1726
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,200
Reports
of resisting arrest,

1727
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,380
Uh, tearing up
the inside of his home,

1728
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:42,300
And barging into
the girls' locker room.

1729
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,550
Oh, barging?

1730
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,390
Who's been feeding you
this crap?

1731
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:47,090
Mr. Jones,
I'm not here

1732
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:48,390
To argue with you.

1733
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,810
I'm not arguing
with you.

1734
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,010
I asked you
a simple question.

1735
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,600
Who's been feeding you
this crap?

1736
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,270
The reason I ask is because, um,

1737
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:57,940
Those were
all instances

1738
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,390
In which he wasn't
being supervised.

1739
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,320
Says who?

1740
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,360
Says who?

1741
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:07,910
Bottom line,
with ms. Kennedy gone,

1742
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,900
James faces
some rough times ahead now.

1743
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:12,400
To keep him
in a school setting-

1744
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:13,750
Let me tell you something, son.

1745
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,240
This school is the reason

1746
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,090
He's doing as well
as he's doing.

1747
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:20,040
But to keep him
in a school setting-

1748
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:21,910
You take him out of this school,

1749
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,760
You might as well
just take his life from him.

1750
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:26,600
I have compiled a list

1751
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,800
Of outside
care agencies.

1752
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,380
Oh, I'll bet
you have.

1753
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:55,780
Yes, ma'am, I will take care
of it personally.

1754
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:57,800
Yes, I will.

1755
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,050
Yes, ma'am.

1756
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,250
Yes, ma'am.

1757
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,290
Is that a fact?

1758
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:09,960
That's
some serious money.

1759
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:11,290
Well, all right.

1760
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,140
Yes, I will.

1761
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:16,600
All right, now.
You too.

1762
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:17,970
Harold.

1763
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:19,070
Hello, Frank.

1764
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:20,430
It's been
a long time

1765
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:21,640
Since you came
through my door.

1766
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:24,110
Yeah, it sure has been.

1767
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,480
So...

1768
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:32,980
What can I do
for you?

1769
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,580
What are you trying
to do here, Frank?

1770
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,920
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1771
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:38,590
Yeah, you do.

1772
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:41,170
Calling the school board,
making complaints about radio.

1773
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,790
This is about you

1774
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,710
Getting back at me
for cracking down on your boy,

1775
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,430
And nothing more
than that.

1776
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:48,300
Let's not go off
making this all personal.

1777
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:49,880
It is personal.

1778
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,550
It is not personal...
Besides which, if it was,

1779
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:53,430
I wouldn't have
most of the guys

1780
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,970
Over at Del and don's
feeling the same way I do.

1781
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,610
Yeah, what way is that?

1782
01:27:57,670 --> 01:28:00,470
Harold,
you're one of the finest coaches

1783
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,230
In the upstate,

1784
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:06,450
And with Johnny and the boys
we got coming back next year...

1785
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:08,030
It's just better

1786
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,700
If we do things
the way we used to.

1787
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:16,520
You just want to be the one
runs radio out of Hanna.

1788
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:24,700
At least I know where you stand.

1789
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,140
Radio.

1790
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,700
That's the o,
big, round circle.

1791
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,640
Yeah, you try it now.

1792
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,640
Come on,
it's all right.

1793
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:36,730
It's okay.

1794
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:38,760
There you go,
take the pencil.

1795
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,350
You can do it.
I know you can.

1796
01:28:56,850 --> 01:29:00,350
That's it.

1797
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,650
Look at that.

1798
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,120
You did it.

1799
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:05,740
Congratulations.

1800
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:07,320
Good job.

1801
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,880
Radio right there.
Yeah.

1802
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,190
Radio right there.

1803
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:18,870
Hey,
look who's back.

1804
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,810
What's up, Jimmy?

1805
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,010
Johnny,
welcome back, man.

1806
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,260
What's this?

1807
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:30,350
He brought that in
a little while ago.

1808
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:00,410
Hi.

1809
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:05,100
Sorry coach Jones
got mad at you.

1810
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,520
He got real mad.

1811
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,590
Yeah.

1812
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,310
Yeah, he did.

1813
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:14,480
Yeah.

1814
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,730
Real mad.

1815
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,110
<i>Jackets playing tough d.</i>

1816
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,570
<i>And there's a steal by walker!</i>

1817
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:33,380
<i>Honeycutt calling the play now</i>

1818
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,830
<i>As the jackets
walk it up the floor.</i>

1819
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:36,550
Two! Two!

1820
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,280
<i>Jackson has it in the corner.</i>

1821
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:39,300
<i>Finds Clay,</i>

1822
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:40,800
<i>Who drives foul line.</i>

1823
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:43,120
<i>Great pass to cunningham.</i>

1824
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:44,340
<i>Underneath for an easy two.</i>

1825
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:47,470
All right!

1826
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,060
<i>Johnny Clay,
doing it all tonight.</i>

1827
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,850
Down the floor,
up the score!

1828
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:52,900
We want two!

1829
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,400
<i>Now Clay from deep.</i>

1830
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:01,140
<i>Good!</i>

1831
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:10,860
<i>Johnny Clay has 17 points.</i>

1832
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:13,170
<i>And that's the end
of the first half</i>

1833
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:16,420
<i>With the score
Hanna, 39, easley, 34.</i>

1834
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:18,820
That's a good
first half, boys.

1835
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:22,040
That's a good first half.

1836
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:23,930
You gonna stick around?

1837
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,960
Yeah.

1838
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:26,350
Save my seat for me.

1839
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,300
All right,
bring me a drink, will you?

1840
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:28,180
Yep.

1841
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:33,340
Well, I talked to mr. Tucker
and his colleagues,

1842
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:34,770
And we all agreed

1843
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,310
That the best thing
for everybody

1844
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,060
Is to get together
and have a meeting.

1845
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:40,280
Well, I don't want
to talk about him.

1846
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,810
Harold.

1847
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:47,150
Wait, I know
what you were thinking.

1848
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,150
I thought you and I
were together on this.

1849
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,570
I'm trying to find

1850
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:50,960
The best possible
solution for everybody.

1851
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:51,990
It's not about who-

1852
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:52,990
What is it about?

1853
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,380
You remember asking me
where all this was going?

1854
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:02,380
Do you?

1855
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,470
You know, I still don't know,
but I do know one thing.

1856
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,420
I am not going to sit back

1857
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:11,730
And let Frank Clay
make the rules on this.

1858
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:17,350
<i>Clay saves it off the tip.</i>

1859
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,380
<i>Underneath to henry.</i>

1860
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,550
<i>Great teamwork!</i>

1861
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,900
<i>And the jackets go up by seven.</i>

1862
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,060
<i>Clay off the screen.</i>

1863
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,440
<i>Jumper!</i>

1864
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:29,410
<i>Good!</i>

1865
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,370
<i>Johnny Clay in the zone now.</i>

1866
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:38,590
<i>Easley working the ball</i>

1867
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:40,070
<i>Upcourt...</i>

1868
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,960
<i>And Clay with the steal.</i>

1869
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:46,090
<i>Great pass by Clay to greer
for the easy two.</i>

1870
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:48,300
<i>And the jackets
are running away</i>

1871
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,750
<i>With this one!</i>

1872
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,470
Feels good, don't it?

1873
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:58,090
Feels real good.

1874
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,810
Settle down,
settle down, settle down.

1875
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:03,610
Now, I've coached a lot
of basketball over the years,

1876
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,930
But I've never, ever had a team
play better

1877
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:06,950
Than you all did tonight.

1878
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:12,120
Johnny Clay,
it's nice having you back.

1879
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,450
Yeah, it is.

1880
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:14,870
It's good to be back,
coach.

1881
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:16,540
Good.
Good.

1882
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:17,960
We're still
in this race.

1883
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,130
I want you all
to rest up tomorrow,

1884
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,460
We're gonna
hit it hard Monday.

1885
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:24,500
All right? Get some sleep.

1886
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,750
Play it.
You got a shot.

1887
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,800
You better
believe it.

1888
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:27,970
Hey, there's my boy.

1889
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:29,220
Always a pleasure
to see you.

1890
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:30,470
Good game, son.

1891
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,790
32.

1892
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,460
Yeah, but what's with
all that passing?

1893
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:34,640
With the defense
they were playing,

1894
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:35,640
You could have gone
for 50.

1895
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:37,630
Bye-bye, see you later.

1896
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,310
You gotta take advantage
of these chances, son.

1897
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,130
See you later.
Bye-bye.

1898
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:41,650
See you later, radio.

1899
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:43,770
Bye, Johnny. Bye, now.
See you later.

1900
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,400
What's that?

1901
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:47,740
Okay. Okay.

1902
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:50,140
It's nothing.

1903
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:54,660
Look, son, we got a whole lot
to look forward to next year,

1904
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:57,410
And I don't want anything
or anyone getting in the way.

1905
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,000
You understand?

1906
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:04,200
Radio's not the one
getting in the way, dad.

1907
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,850
And that Frank,

1908
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:15,630
He's just scared you got it in
for his son, is all.

1909
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,850
<i>When gloria was a baby,
I never left her alone.</i>

1910
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,270
<i>Wherever I went,</i>

1911
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:20,690
<i>I made sure
edith stayed with her.</i>

1912
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,440
I forgot to tell you
honeycutt called.

1913
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:28,650
Yeah, some of the parents
asked for a meeting with lou

1914
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:30,780
On Sunday night.

1915
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:32,700
With just lou?

1916
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,740
Yeah, I don't think
they're particularly interested

1917
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,850
In your side of things. Do you?

1918
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:39,740
No, I guess not.

1919
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:44,240
<i>What the hell
kind of a father-</i>

1920
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:47,130
<i>What the hell kind of a father
are you?</i>

1921
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,670
Aw, hell.

1922
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,530
Maybe the whole thing's
just a big mistake.

1923
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:52,220
Radio probably
would've been better off

1924
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,670
If we'd just gotten him
some help.

1925
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:56,170
Help?

1926
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:59,180
And what you've been giving him
has been...

1927
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:01,930
Couldn't have been easy
on you and Mary Helen,

1928
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:03,650
Me spending all this time
with radio

1929
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,730
Past few months.

1930
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:06,220
Harold, wait.

1931
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:07,570
You can't believe
that's been a mistake,

1932
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:11,820
You being with radio.

1933
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:14,060
You've been so great
for each other.

1934
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:16,360
Yeah, well,
look where it's got us.

1935
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:17,740
Where it got you

1936
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:19,900
Is a school full of kids
that love him,

1937
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:22,200
And Mary Helen
feels the same way,

1938
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,730
And anything
that Frank can do or say,

1939
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:25,950
That's not going to change
anything.

1940
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:28,760
It's never a mistake

1941
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,760
To care for someone.

1942
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,240
That's always a good thing.

1943
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:36,130
Right?

1944
01:35:40,590 --> 01:35:41,640
Thank you, reverend.

1945
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:42,640
God bless you,
sister.

1946
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:43,640
And god bless you.

1947
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:44,810
That was quite a sermon.

1948
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:47,640
Indeed.
Praise the lord.

1949
01:35:47,730 --> 01:35:49,440
God bless you, radio.

1950
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:50,560
Praise the lord.

1951
01:35:50,610 --> 01:35:51,860
Coach.

1952
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:53,200
Praise the lord.
I love that sermon.

1953
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:54,480
I like that.

1954
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:56,600
All hands are jesus' hands,
I like that.

1955
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:57,650
I like that,

1956
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,320
The way
everybody singing.

1957
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,440
Yeah, that was
a nice service.

1958
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:01,940
A nice service.

1959
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,820
I need to talk to you

1960
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:04,910
About a little something
here.

1961
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,460
Hey, hey.

1962
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,880
You remember telling me
about being in 11th grade?

1963
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:11,110
Oh, you talking
about ms. Winniver.

1964
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:12,300
Yeah, that's right.

1965
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:13,780
Yeah,
I like ms. Winniver.

1966
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:14,970
Well, there's been
some talk

1967
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:17,420
About maybe you going on
to 12th grade.

1968
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:19,640
That'd be something,
wouldn't it?

1969
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:22,590
You know,
have you graduate.

1970
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,980
Radio, listen to me.

1971
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:26,480
Put your-
take your radio d-

1972
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,300
Radio, listen,
put your radio down.

1973
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:30,020
Look at me.
Look at me.

1974
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:32,240
There ain't nothing wrong
with moving on, son.

1975
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,300
Everybody gets around to it
sooner or later.

1976
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,690
No.

1977
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:37,810
No, I like the 11th grade.

1978
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,480
I like the 11th grade.

1979
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:40,980
No. No.

1980
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:42,700
I do the-
I do the-

1981
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,480
I do the menu in the morning.
I do the menu.

1982
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:46,320
I say,
"we're all gonna have hamburgers

1983
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:47,650
And we're gonna have
mashed potatoes,"

1984
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,370
And then I see people
in the hallway,

1985
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:50,870
I say,
"hey. No running.

1986
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,210
No running.
Everybody, no running. "

1987
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:53,820
And everybody know that's radio.

1988
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:54,820
I'm there.
Everybody like that.

1989
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,630
Ms. Winniver like that.

1990
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,290
They say, "hi, radio!"

1991
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:58,430
All right, listen.

1992
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,010
No. No.
I like-

1993
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:01,550
We'll talk about it
closer to the fall, all right?

1994
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:03,000
Let's not worry about it
right now.

1995
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:03,970
All right?

1996
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:05,550
Radio like the fall.

1997
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:06,720
That's when
the football come.

1998
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,000
Yeah, that's right.

1999
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,470
It's football,
we go exercise,

2000
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,510
And everybody have
no shirt and t-shirts on,

2001
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,010
And coach honeycutt,

2002
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,780
He be, "let's see
some Hanna spirit!"

2003
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:16,860
Yeah, and hey,
coach, you say,

2004
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:18,350
"let's get the quarterback,"

2005
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,350
And radio, he defense coach.

2006
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,990
I'll be defense coach.

2007
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,570
That's right,
because we gonna go all the way.

2008
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:24,740
That's right, radio.

2009
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:25,790
We gonna go
all the way.

2010
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:27,540
We gonna go all the way.

2011
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:28,990
Because we got
the spirit.

2012
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:40,300
We going
all the way.

2013
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:42,260
We going all the way.

2014
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:45,710
My point is
that this man

2015
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,710
Is a disruptive force
in our community

2016
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,650
And represents a threat
to our students.

2017
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:52,430
Thank you, mr. Clay.

2018
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,980
Okay, okay.

2019
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:57,220
I understand how some of you
might be feeling.

2020
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:59,320
All I am asking
is that if we decide

2021
01:37:59,390 --> 01:38:01,330
That there's no other way
around this

2022
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:03,890
That we dole out
as little hurt as possible.

2023
01:38:03,950 --> 01:38:05,700
Fine.

2024
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:08,030
Honeycutt, is there anything
you'd like to add?

2025
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,090
Evening, Del. Don.

2026
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:16,540
Harold.
Harold.

2027
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,760
Evening, everyone.

2028
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,240
Evening.

2029
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,880
Hi, lou.

2030
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:25,080
How you doing?

2031
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:26,100
I'm good.
I'm good.

2032
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:27,180
How are you?

2033
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:28,250
Good.

2034
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:31,560
I was gonna
call you.

2035
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:33,940
Well, you got yourself
a crowded shop tonight, Del.

2036
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:35,780
Yeah, coach.

2037
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:37,090
I think y'all know my wife,
Linda,

2038
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:38,060
And my daughter,

2039
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:39,730
Mary Helen.

2040
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:41,480
Evening.

2041
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:43,070
Evening, ma'am.

2042
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:47,790
Well, I had a talk with radio
this morning,

2043
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:49,710
And I told him,

2044
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:51,830
In not so many words,

2045
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:53,940
That we might be looking
at some changes.

2046
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,300
It didn't take long to see
the more I talked,

2047
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:57,410
The more he didn't
understand me.

2048
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:02,170
We got a lot of that
going on around.

2049
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:08,630
When I was playing,

2050
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,390
I had a coach,

2051
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:14,300
He used to tell me
to keep my priorities straight.

2052
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:16,800
He'd say, "son, you figure out
what's important.

2053
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:20,140
You push everything else aside. "

2054
01:39:23,830 --> 01:39:25,160
I love football.

2055
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:29,150
I love everything about it.

2056
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,700
I love Friday nights

2057
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:33,450
When you're looking for a win,

2058
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,150
And Saturday morning
when you found one.

2059
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:45,350
But that's not what's important
right now.

2060
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:50,770
We got ourselves a young man
we're not thinking about...

2061
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,390
The same young man

2062
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:55,020
Who could hardly talk
when we first met him,

2063
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,610
And now he's making
announcements in the morning

2064
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:57,810
Over the loudspeaker.

2065
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,190
The same young man

2066
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,010
Who got himself
a football letter last fall,

2067
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,510
But he never wears it,

2068
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:07,200
Because he can't afford
a jacket.

2069
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:11,690
Now we're asking him to leave.

2070
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,160
Harold, we are not asking-

2071
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:15,040
The man's not done,
Frank.

2072
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:21,700
I know some of you don't know
or don't care

2073
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:25,500
About all that radio's learned
over these past few months.

2074
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:30,010
Well, the truth is

2075
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:34,340
We're not the ones
been teaching radio.

2076
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,930
Radio's the one
been teaching us.

2077
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:41,430
Because the way he treats us
all the time

2078
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,220
Is the way we wish
we treated each other

2079
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:44,520
Even part of the time.

2080
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:51,240
Look, I know
something's gotta happen here.

2081
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:54,330
I know-I know some changes
gotta be made...

2082
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,000
And I know

2083
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,920
I can't let what happened
last season

2084
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,400
Happen again.

2085
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:07,380
So I've decided to step down
as head football coach.

2086
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,360
See what you've done, Frank?

2087
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:26,600
You know,
I'd like to keep teaching,

2088
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:27,950
If that's all right.

2089
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:29,930
Keep an eye
on radio,

2090
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:32,540
Make sure he stays
out of trouble,

2091
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,490
And I'd like to spend
a little more time

2092
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:37,910
With a few other folks
I've neglected over the years,

2093
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,660
While I still
have a chance to.

2094
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:45,780
Much as I love
this game, you know,

2095
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:47,280
It's not
half as important

2096
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:50,000
As setting that right.

2097
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:55,340
That was a pretty good cup
tonight, Del.

2098
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:58,630
Thank y'all.

2099
01:41:58,680 --> 01:41:59,900
Good night.

2100
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:07,240
This what
you wanted?

2101
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:10,320
Is this worth it?

2102
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,750
That was a crazy idea.

2103
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:17,360
Weren't expecting
that one, now, were you?

2104
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:18,820
I can't believe

2105
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:20,480
You're gonna stop
coaching football.

2106
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:29,130
Found it.

2107
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:30,680
Oh, there.

2108
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:32,930
Under the mattress
with everything else.

2109
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,220
All right.

2110
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,050
Oh, you look great,
radio.

2111
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:39,470
Thanks, Mary Helen.

2112
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,600
I'll see you
out there, daddy.

2113
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:41,340
All right, honey.

2114
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:42,440
There she go.

2115
01:42:42,510 --> 01:42:44,060
Get your collar down.

2116
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,840
You look good, now.
You look really good.

2117
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:46,940
You know where
we're gonna be, right?

2118
01:42:47,010 --> 01:42:47,980
Yeah.

2119
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:49,060
All right.

2120
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:50,030
Do a good job.

2121
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:51,400
I'm awful proud of you.

2122
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,320
Okay, coach. There I go.

2123
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:54,870
Hey, radio.

2124
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:56,200
Oh, hey, Johnny,
how you doing there?

2125
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:57,740
How you doing?

2126
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:59,710
I heard you got yourself
a letter.

2127
01:42:59,790 --> 01:43:01,690
Yeah, they gave me a letter.

2128
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,490
Me and the boys thought
you might need something

2129
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:04,580
To put it on.

2130
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,880
That for radio?

2131
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:10,170
Yeah.

2132
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:14,970
How you like that one?

2133
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,010
Looks good on you, man.

2134
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:19,890
Thanks, Johnny.

2135
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:25,020
Hey, congratulations, man,
and, uh...

2136
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:26,180
Thanks a lot.

2137
01:43:26,230 --> 01:43:27,520
Yeah.

2138
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:29,820
Patricia ann yearwood.

2139
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,570
Thanks, radio.

2140
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:34,720
You're the best.

2141
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,080
Thank you.

2142
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:41,250
I would also like
to extend a special thank-you

2143
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:42,730
To our honorary graduate,

2144
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:45,590
Mr. James Robert
Kennedy...

2145
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:55,050
Yeah, radio!
All right!

2146
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,510
Who has decided
to return

2147
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:59,100
This coming fall

2148
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:01,430
As an 11th-grade student

2149
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:02,920
At Hanna,

2150
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:04,800
Where he will be welcome

2151
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:06,610
For as many such years
as he so chooses.

2152
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:14,280
Looks like you got
your assistant coach back.

2153
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:15,650
Yes, we did.

2154
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,320
Yeah!

2155
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,490
<i>In that moment,
my husband was prouder</i>

2156
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:22,960
<i>Than if his team had won
a state title.</i>

2157
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:31,920
<i>Radio was now officially
a part of Hanna</i>

2158
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:36,050
<i>And a part of our lives
forever.</i>

2159
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:38,170
<i>So if you happen to be
in anderson</i>

2160
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:39,790
<i>On a Friday night in the fall,</i>

2161
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,560
<i>Get there early.</i>

2162
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:44,090
<i>You'll see the man
they call radio</i>

01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:47,310
<i>Leading the yellow jackets
onto the field.</i>

Hanna's ever had.</i>

Into the South Carolina
coaches hall of fame.

He's retired from teaching now,

¶ 'cause none of us
is perfect ¶

2190
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:31,920
¶ but the way that I see it
why don't you just try ¶
