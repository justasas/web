1
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,300
=It's another happy morning.
How are you? I'm Gim Jang Wan.=

2
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,670
=The drizzle outside the window
seems beautiful too...=

3
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,840
=This is Pak So Hyeon's 'Love Game'.
Pak So Hyeon joins you in today's program.=

4
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,380
=Let us enjoy a wonderful time together...=

5
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,800
=I'm the host of Wonderful Radio, Sin Jin A.=

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,130
=My dear listeners, thank you
for accompanying me all this while...=

7
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,600
-=Wonderful Radio=-

8
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,250
Here you go.

9
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:24,880
Thank you.

10
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,800
Aigoo...  our hope, you are tired too, right?
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)

11
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm all right.

12
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,300
Don't drink too much coffee.

13
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,800
You're going to be 30 years old soon.
All of your hair is going to be white before you know it.

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,210
Wait until I release my new album.
I'll visit the hair salon everyday.

15
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,920
Your album? What a joke.

16
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,710
The script for the third
and fourth segments.

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,000
Who are they?

18
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,000
Colpi Girls.

19
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,460
Didn't they say they invited Dal Shabet?

20
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,460
Our program should also invite those
currently popular kids. Please.

21
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,880
We're already lucky to get Colpi Girls
to appear in our program.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,030
Get in quickly.

23
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,300
Next week, please do me a favor
and invite a male idol group.

24
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,420
Looks really alike. Looks really alike.

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,010
Hello! We are the Colpi Girls.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,300
You all are really pretty.
I hope we have an enjoyable time today.

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,500
Yes, we will.

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,080
Giving a good greeting is the most crucial.

29
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,000
When I was still a member of Purple, I felt that
meeting sunbaes was harder than going on stage.
(sunbae - senior, mentor)

30
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,670
- Eonni, you were a singer?
- Purple?
(Eonni - older sister)

31
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,500
No way.

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,520
Don't you know Purple?

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,000
- Eonni. We're going on air soon, get ready.
- Okay.

34
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,170
=Power FM.=

35
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,170
The third and fourth segments of
Wonderful Radio will be done together
with the new female group, Colpi Girls.

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,340
Hello everybody! We are the Colpi Girls.

37
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,200
They're a really cheerful and energetic group.

38
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,050
Their high vitality is like carps in
a whirl that are rushing to breed.

39
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,980
They are extremely impetuous,

40
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,680
<i>but are also an extremely
ignorant yet innocent group.</i>

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,470
Thank you!

42
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,020
So, for the first song of today,
we'll start off with a song from Colpi Girls.

43
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,280
"Get Out Boy".

44
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,980
It seems that you don't know Purple.

45
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,710
What year were you girls born in?

46
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,190
- 1991.
- I was born in 1994.

47
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,920
Year 2004, Republic of South Korea...

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,130
Oh, damn!

49
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,050
I knew it would be like this.
What should I do? What should I do?

50
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,670
Be quiet!

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,230
Really, shut up will you?

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,550
Hyeong!
(Hyeong - older brother)

53
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,520
This song is sure to be a hit.

54
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,550
Sin Jin A is here! Sin Jin A!

55
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,280
- Sin Jin A?
- Sin Jin A.

56
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,360
<i>Omo!</i>
(Omo - oh my)

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,570
Please, just wait a second.

58
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,570
Let's talk! Didn't you say you were
going to give that song to me?

59
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,950
Quick, go in!

60
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,780
- Hey!
- Wait a minute!

61
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,400
Wait, don't be impulsive!

62
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,750
Oppa!
(Oppa - older brother)

63
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,670
Come out.

64
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,750
Oppa, come out now!

65
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,630
<i>Oppa!</i>

66
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,050
Jin A.

67
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,040
I understand that you're very angry.

68
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,880
I completely understand.

69
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,010
However...

70
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,300
It was my only choice.

71
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,550
The more it is like this,
the more we have to be reasonable.

72
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,130
Didn't you say that song was
specifically written for me?

73
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,710
Yes, but...

74
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,550
After the lyrics were written,

75
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,050
I realized that the song is
perfect for idols. Idols!

76
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,800
Oppa!

77
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,800
Jin A.

78
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,750
At the beginning of next month,

79
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,610
my fourth child will be born.

80
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,000
Furthermore, they're twins. I have to earn
money for their powdered milk and diapers!

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,820
So what if it is just one song?
I want to earn it even if it is just 100 dollars. This is reality...

82
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
More importantly,

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,840
idols are the current trend.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,840
You really disappoint me.

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,340
From now on, I won't accept the songs you
compose even if you give them to me for free.

86
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,670
Goodbye.

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Jin A.

88
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,550
Hey!

89
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,210
What is my schedule for tomorrow?

90
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,380
Nuna, I'll send you a text message
about it when I get home.
(Nuna - older sister)

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,380
Why do you want to send a text?
Just tell me now.

92
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,470
Nuna, we're very lucky and have
a solo concert tomorrow.

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,160
At the Sangmun Elementary School's
24th class graduates reunion.

94
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,290
We're planned to perform there.

95
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,960
Hey! Who do you think I am?

96
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,460
What? I'm going to sing at
Sangmun Elementary School's
24th class graduates reunion?

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,050
Cancel it!

98
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,460
My credit card's debt
deadline is approaching,

99
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,000
and in fact these 3 days I have
been using soap to wash my hair.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,670
You... didn't I tell you that I will
be releasing a music album soon?

101
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,130
Oh, you're back?

102
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,250
Hello auntie.

103
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,340
Dae Geun, you're here?

104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,170
You've worked hard.
Have a meal before you leave.

105
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,710
Okay!

106
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,980
Hey...

107
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,370
Oh yes, auntie. I have to go back
to adjust tomorrow's schedule.

108
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,300
I'll come by and have a meal next time.

109
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:54,670
Bye.

110
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,250
Dae Geun, have a meal then go...

111
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,130
You... wretch.

112
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,500
<i>Why are you so fierce to Dae Geun?</i>

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,170
Where is there still such a good kid like him?

114
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,630
You must treat him better, wretch.

115
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,000
<i>You can't even give him his wages on
time & you still treat him like that?</i>

116
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,730
Just rest a while, why do you work till so late?

117
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,000
After resting enough, it's a must to
continue working hard to earn money.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,630
I really don't know what to do about you.

119
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,550
There isn't even a single customer!
Isn't it good to close the shop and rest?

120
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,130
Rest, what rest?

121
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,670
Why is it so hard to tie...

122
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,380
Welcome! Please come inside.

123
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,590
abeoji, come and have a sit here.
(abeoji - father)

124
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,420
You see, here comes 6 more people!

125
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,510
<i>Daughter-in-law, come quickly.</i>

126
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,620
<i>Aigoo...really pretty.</i>

127
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,630
This is the vicinity's most famous shop.

128
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,170
What should we eat?

129
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,750
I'll get another menu for you,

130
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,250
please wait for awhile.

131
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,550
You must eat more later...

132
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,300
Aish, you wretch.

133
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Done.

134
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,420
=To me, there are two Christmas in one year.=

135
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,590
=Once in December,=

136
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,920
=and once in June.=

137
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,920
=This week,=

138
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,670
=is my self-appointed midsummer Christmas.=

139
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,670
=During Christmas this June,=

140
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,340
=I haven't confirmed=

141
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,880
=what wish I want to make=

142
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,050
=to Santa Claus.=

143
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,050
What about you?

144
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,050
Do you want to find

145
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,210
a wishing box together with me

146
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,380
and place June's wishes in one at a time?

147
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,710
<i>Right now,</i>

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,380
=let us make our wishes towards
the seemingly bored Santa.=

149
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,380
Today's Christmas,

150
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,250
please don't let me be alone again.

151
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,210
The second segment of Wonderful Radio will now
use the writing method to interact with the listeners.

152
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,960
Humans themselves are what causes desperation,

153
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,480
and they are also what changes desperation into hope.

154
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,690
<i>Listener 2065, thank you for sending in an
exciting quotation with beautiful fresh flowers.</i>

155
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,710
Next, lets listen to a requested song.

156
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,000
<i>After School's...</i>

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,460
-=Requested song: After School's "Love Love Love"=-

158
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,840
-=Requested song: After School's "Love Love Love"=-

159
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,380
PD, can I also request one song today?
(PD - Program Director)

160
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,300
Purple's "You're My Angel".

161
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,630
<i>PD Yun Ji Seon who has been
working together with us for 4 years,</i>

162
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,460
has to temporary say goodbye to us

163
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,840
because she is going into labor.

164
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,590
<i>This is to show my gratitude to PD Yun.</i>

165
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,920
I wish that everything proceeds smoothly for you.

166
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,000
Aigoo...she actually dare to use her past song

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,170
for broadcast.

168
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,210
You were looking for me?

169
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,920
Sit.

170
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,050
It's been a while.

171
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,210
Let's be straightforward,

172
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,210
you need to take over the program, Wonderful Radio.

173
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,000
Are you talking about Yun sunbae's program?
(sunbae - senior/mentor)

174
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,300
Frankly speaking,

175
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,840
the listenership of this program is a complete mess!

176
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,210
I estimate that there will be a meeting
very soon to discuss the issue of DJ replacement.

177
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,920
But no matter how you say it, that program
was created with Yun sunbae's painstaking effort...

178
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,920
That's true,

179
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,460
but the listening rate is only 2%.

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,170
<i>I will speak with PD Yun,</i>

181
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,800
so you take over and turn the situation around.

182
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,810
Lock the door before leaving.

183
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,390
Yes.

184
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,360
Remember to cultivate a good habit and go home early,

185
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,380
=Okay?=

186
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,260
Have a safe trip.

187
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,050
Hyeong, you're leaving already?

188
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,910
Didn't you say you were going to bring me the album?

189
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,190
I'm sorry, I'll bring it for you next time.

190
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,630
You cannot keep forgetting...

191
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,250
I know, I know already. Sorry, and have a safe trip.

192
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,420
Hyeong, why did you come here?

193
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,090
Aren't you supposed to come by next week to be our PD?

194
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,030
Wonderful?

195
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,240
Baekhwaju?
(Baekhwaju - wine made of 100 varieties of flowers)

196
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,980
Just give anything.

197
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,090
But how come it's you who's coming?

198
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,820
Our program doesn't allow you
to broadcast songs as you like.

199
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,840
How's the DJ?

200
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,060
You mean Jin A?

201
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,000
She's treated as a princess.

202
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,710
I seriously hate that style of people.

203
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,010
I presume Jin A also hates people like you.

204
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,820
Maybe.

205
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,460
Do you really need to make the schedules so rushing?

206
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,500
Nuna, do you remember that
whenever I step on the brake,

207
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,340
our car makes a very weird sound?

208
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,990
I went and repaired it at the
repair shop today, now listen to it...

209
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,460
Hey! Cha Dae Geun!

210
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,880
<i>Should I give her a call?</i>

211
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,070
<i>Oh, eonni.
(eonni - older sister)</i>

212
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,090
eonni...

213
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,040
- Quickly, quickly. Why are you only here now?
- Do you have makeup remover?

214
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,700
My makeup is totally ruined.

215
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,210
I heard that the new PD has a
character that is as bad as a dog.

216
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,070
I also heard that, like a dog.

217
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,750
<i>He came so early?</i>

218
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,370
He was here since just now...

219
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,340
Hello, I am Sin Jin A's manager, Cha Dae Geun.

220
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,620
- Rumors always...
- What time is it already?

221
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,050
Why are you so late? How do you feel about
making us wait here for Miss Sin Jin A for half an hour?

222
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,050
That is because there was traffic congestion and also...

223
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,250
Before your DJ highness arrived, we roughly
got familiarized with one another.

224
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,630
A large portion of the program's
topics can be reluctantly accepted,

225
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,920
but there is a problem.

226
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,090
'My love equation'.

227
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,340
It is so mushy that it causes goosebumps.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,670
But PD, I like this topic...

229
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,670
The response from audiences is very good and it
is necessary to have a suitable extent of mushiness

230
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,340
to gain popularity. Right, right?

231
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,170
Who told you the audience's reactions were good?

232
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,620
Submit to me a new proposal of the
program's activities before 11 tomorrow.

233
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,320
Tomorrow...

234
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,320
11 O'clock...

235
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,580
PD,

236
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,500
do you think this is the internet where you can
just press the computer keyboard and get what you want?

237
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,840
Think about how hard it is to plan a new proposal...

238
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
That is why there is a writer here isn't it?

239
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,380
But may I ask, why do you keep interrupting my lines?

240
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,550
For first meetings, you should at least
be polite and do a self-introduction

241
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,380
to be roughly familiar with one another.

242
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,050
Not create an atmosphere that
seems to be filled with adjustments.

243
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,380
Only then can you work together
properly isn't it? Right, right?

244
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
Your eyes are really beautiful.

245
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,710
People often say that.

246
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,550
So, we'll end here.

247
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I felt that you should like this kind of beverage...

248
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,710
Men with exquisite beauty should like expresso...

249
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:33,710
Oh, right...

250
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,710
When lying down,

251
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,090
first start from your head.

252
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,300
<i>Then slowly place your spine down one segment at a time.</i>

253
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,570
Straighten your waist,

254
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,430
<i>and assume a bent posture.</i>

255
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,090
Try pressing down,

256
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,260
<i>and maintain.</i>

257
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,920
How's PD Yun doing?

258
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,300
She is on a maternity leave.

259
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,670
Then who replaced the PD?

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,630
There is a new one.

261
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,340
Is it a man?

262
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,920
Yes it is. But he has completely
no proper upbringing! Annoying guy.

263
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,090
Stern city man?

264
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,920
Nope. City man who is always finding fault with others.

265
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,330
Talking about finding fault, that group Colpi Girls
or something...

266
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,590
is really asking for it.

267
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,840
Think about our past.

268
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,670
In the past we were idolized and powerful!

269
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,340
Exactly. Every weekend we will be able to hear...

270
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,050
Topping the chart this week is Purple!

271
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,420
Thank you!

272
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,250
Thanks to all the fans and friends of our fan club. I love you!

273
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,130
So, up next,

274
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,550
Purple's encore of "You're My Angel"...

275
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,960
~ <i>You are my angel, angel, angel to me.</i> ~

276
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,090
~ <i>Just like this, forever treasure and keep our love.</i> ~

277
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,000
~ <i>You are my angel.</i> ~

278
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,050
Thank you everyone, see you at the next performance!

279
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,750
I love you, I love you everyone.

280
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Really miss those times...

281
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,050
Camera!

282
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,550
<i>Scene 423.</i>

283
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,210
Action!

284
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,130
Cut! Cut! Good! Enough! Don't film already!

285
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,900
Film the next title.

286
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,910
<i>Director, is it okay?</i>

287
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,640
- Okay!
- Hey, didn't I say okay already?

288
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,210
Miss Mi Ra, you've grasped the feeling well.

289
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,420
Cut! Cut! Okay! It's good! The feeling is good, you've grasped it well.

290
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,240
Film one more time.

291
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,920
Enough, enough, enough... There's not
enough time. Do you think you're filming a movie?

292
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,790
Okay!

293
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,750
You're really great, Representative Lee.

294
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,050
Director Jin, you must also know

295
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,920
that advertisements need to be smooth.

296
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Do you remember Ajinomoto? Seasoning.

297
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,420
How long do you think they took to shoot URUSA?
(URUSA - A type of liver medicine made from bear bile)

298
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,500
They took a half-moon bear from Jirisan
(Jirisan - A mountain in the southern part of South Korea)

299
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,710
and drained it for so many years.

300
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,170
The century hearing aid's advertisement
that was filmed over 10 years using one left ear,

301
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,380
has a huge advertisement in the Korean daily newspaper!

302
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
'Carrying a guitar' was also filmed for so many years!

303
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,040
Mi Ra is the same kind of long term worker.

304
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,960
Get ready.

305
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,500
Thanks to your company artist's good fortune,

306
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,840
life has been comfortable recently.

307
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,460
It is thanks to hyeongnim's good fortune instead.
Only if you're doing well then we'll have a good life.

308
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,800
Especially that 10 O'clock slot 'Idol'.

309
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,170
- Who was it that the program brought over? Pink Dolls?

310
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,170
- You're talking about Pink Dols?
- Yes, yes, yes...

311
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,250
The amount of listeners tuning in is really significant!

312
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,340
It's all because you chose well, hyeongnim.

313
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,550
The majority of listeners of the 10 O'clock
segment is still secondary school students,

314
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,670
so it is more suitable to rely mainly on idols.

315
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,420
6 O'clock is the time to get off work, hence arrangements
has to be made to consider the working population and taxi drivers.

316
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,840
That's why it is more suitable to
rely on those with higher reputation,

317
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,710
such as Yeun Mi Ra. What do you think?

318
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,750
Mi Ra?

319
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,550
Of course it's not a bad idea.

320
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,380
Not bad, right?

321
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,240
Not bad.

322
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,550
This proposal was painstakingly prepared by the writer and I...

323
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,210
So?

324
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,710
So?

325
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,710
What I'm trying to say is that using this kind of manner
to treat the author who has put in so much effort isn't too good...

326
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,090
For me, doing well is more important than working hard.

327
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,920
I believe that a good DJ should have three requirements.

328
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,420
Popularity, ability,

329
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,890
as well as personality.

330
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,380
Or at least possess two out of three.

331
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,630
No. Must at least have one, don't you think so?

332
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,420
What's the purpose of you telling me this now?

333
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,380
Don't always mix in too much personal
emotions when we are having a meeting,

334
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,330
you'll let people see through your character.

335
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,960
What is your target when it comes to the listener rating?

336
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,400
4%.

337
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,880
Just merely 4%?

338
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,090
The listenership hasn't exceeded 2% within the past half a year,

339
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,250
and you dare to say just merely 4%?

340
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,090
Is the past that important?

341
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,630
Dreams must be ambitious!

342
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,170
In that case, the proposal of the program's new topics...

343
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,820
should be done by Miss Sin Jin A.

344
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,630
Me?

345
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,800
I...what? I can do well...

346
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,960
I do...what? I'll do, I'll do it, I'll do it.

347
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
I, I can do well...

348
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,570
I will look forward to it.

349
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,340
Where did such a fellow come from?

350
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,170
<i>What should I do about this?</i>

351
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,000
<i>Should we wait for the next lift? </i>

352
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,340
Nevermind, just take this.

353
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,710
Hello.

354
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,730
It's been a while, Miss Jin A.

355
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,800
I've recently been watching your drama.

356
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,090
Is it?

357
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,380
I'm really thankful for you saying such a thing.

358
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,880
But, sorry,

359
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,880
I haven't been able to listen to your radio broadcast.

360
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,130
Looks like you only have that little bit of ability.

361
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,340
Do well, Sin Jin A.

362
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,340
If you can only fare so badly after
abandoning Purple for your solo pursuits,

363
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,960
I will feel really bored.

364
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,380
I'll see you again.

365
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,550
Goodbye.

366
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,050
<i>Encore! Encore!</i>

367
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,040
<i>I don't suppose you intend to say that matter here, right?</i>

368
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,500
<i>Jin A,</i>

369
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,380
<i>don't.</i>

370
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,050
<i>Let's think about it again.</i>

371
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,480
<i>It isn't a must for that matter to be said today, isn't it?</i>

372
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,130
<i>I'd like to express my heartfelt thanks to
everyone who came to our concert today.</i>

373
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,030
<i>Today,</i>

374
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,630
<i>there is something I need to announce...</i>

375
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,050
<i>Today's performance will be our last.</i>

376
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,250
<i>From today onwards, our group Purple will be disbanded.</i>

377
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,230
<i>All these while...</i>

378
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,460
<i>thank you for loving us all this while.</i>

379
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,090
<i>Stretch out your other arm</i>

380
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,340
<i>parallel to your eye level.</i>

381
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,460
<i>Now, focus your vision to the direction
where your hand is pointing.</i>

382
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,550
For those who can accomplish that,
please bend your arm backwards

383
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,050
<i>and grab hold of your other hand.</i>

384
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,840
<i>Breathe in,</i>

385
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,880
<i>breathe out.</i>

386
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,380
<i>Inhale and feel the expansion of
your abdominal region and thoracic cavity.</i>

387
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,130
<i>Breath and relax your body muscles.</i>

388
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,550
<i>When doing yoga exercises, remember to
concentrate only on one's feelings.</i>

389
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,590
How did both of you get acquainted?

390
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,250
He's the PD I told you about.

391
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,590
Radio?

392
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,590
Oh, so it's that annoying guy?

393
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,270
Hey!

394
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
What about both of you?

395
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,380
Don't you know Purple's Ji In Yeong?

396
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,090
You don't recognize me?

397
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Oh, the the flat-chested Ji In Yeong?

398
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,210
You've worked hard.

399
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,880
What did he say about me?

400
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,880
Why is he like that?

401
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,130
That's why I asked you to put some sponge pads...

402
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,800
Hey! How do you expect me to put
padding when I'm practising Yoga?

403
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,630
<i>I'm very glad to see all of you.</i>

404
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,800
Then, lets do well.

405
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,840
Bring them for a meal.

406
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,880
Yes, I understand.

407
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,260
See you next time.

408
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,010
Do they think that we are UNICEF?
(UNICEF - The United Nations Children's Fund)

409
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,510
Why do they bring this kind of people here?

410
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,010
So, what do you intend to do about it?

411
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,710
Wait a little longer, there will be a revision soon...

412
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,840
Are you sure?

413
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,260
Now all the popular DJ are our people, why do you still worry?

414
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,340
That's why what I meant was,

415
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,210
this time we have to do it for real.

416
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,550
I do not want to wait too long.

417
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,170
Hey! What I like most is to do it for real!

418
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,260
Hey, shall we go and eat?

419
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,630
<i>Oh...isn't this the newcomer PD Lee?</i>

420
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,190
- Hello everyone.
- It is said that you're now very popular.

421
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,200
What?

422
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,610
Are you talking about me going to the 9 O'clock program?

423
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,300
Not that. Aren't you now working with Jin A?

424
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,840
- Are you very familiar with Sin Jin A?
- Of course.

425
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,150
Before Purple was disbanded, they were
regular guests on our show for 2 months.

426
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,340
They were really awesome and their
songs were especially nice to listen to.

427
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,050
~ <i>You are my angel, angel...</i> ~

428
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,500
I bumped into her not long ago and she started
asking about you and what kind of person you were.

429
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,630
Then what did you say?

430
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,870
I said that you're as stingy as a beggar.

431
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,460
You really are like a beggar,

432
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,180
the DJs all hide and run when
they see you, only you do not know.

433
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,960
You have to treat her better,

434
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,210
there aren't many like her at this age.

435
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,620
She has loyalty and is sexy, pure and courteous.

436
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,090
You on the other hand really resembles a beggar.

437
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,090
How is your yoga practice coming along?

438
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,300
I'm going crazy soon, my body is all stiff.

439
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,380
You will really learn how to be gentle,
you must learn more from me.

440
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,050
He is a faithful yoga fan.

441
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:27,380
Okay, I understand.

442
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,380
Namaste something...
(Namaste - A traditional Indian salutation)

443
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,050
Hyeongnim,

444
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,550
please don't drink alcohol and do the program anymore.

445
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,280
Hey!

446
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,210
What drink alcohol and do the program?
At most is do the program after drinking.

447
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:36,880
Exactly.

448
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,050
You can't say it like that,

449
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,380
it can be very fatal.

450
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,260
- At that time you really caused others to receive the blame.
- You have worked hard.

451
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,230
You make me really upset.

452
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,820
Do you want to go for a drink?

453
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,210
I'll call you tonight.

454
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,280
Okay. You've worked hard.

455
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,710
As the saying goes, a brief encounter is also fate.

456
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,550
Life is boundless,

457
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,710
please look around your surroundings.

458
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,760
For all of you to accompany me at this point of time,

459
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
means having such a large amount of fate with me.

460
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,420
Therefore, being able to hear my voice in the next 2 hours,

461
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,590
doesn't it mean that you and I have a very different kind of fate?

462
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,760
Wonderful Radio, this is Sin Jin A.

463
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,760
Today, our program's new PD Lee Jae Hyeok is right here.

464
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,420
He is one who only drinks ice americano and is a very cool guy.

465
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,760
PD Lee Jae Hyeok, fighting!

466
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,200
-=New program's proposal??=-

467
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,900
-=New program's proposal??=-
-=How dare you!!=-

468
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,010
-=New program's proposal??=-
-=How dare you!!=-
-=Broadcast this song as the first=-

469
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,090
So, let's listen to the first song of today.

470
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:06,760
Are you ready?

471
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,510
Sistar's...

472
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,630
"How Dare You".

473
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,100
-='Seldom is it not the skill of love, but the technique.'
Alphonse Daude -2065=-

474
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,210
<i>I always feel lethargic at this time.</i>

475
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,800
<i>I on the contrary, like this time the most,</i>

476
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,130
<i>as I can eat some light snacks.</i>

477
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,050
-=Change the music.=-
-="Like rain and like music."=-

478
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,300
=Our Wonderful Radio...=

479
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,130
The song for our 3rd segment of Wonderful Radio,

480
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,670
is a song that is very suitable for a rainy day like this.

481
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:28,300
- Gim Gwang Su's song "Like rain and like music".
- What? Gim Gwang Su?

482
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,450
Whose song did you say this was?

483
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,380
Oh, is it Kim Hyeon Shik's?

484
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,420
I'll correct it when the broadcast is over.

485
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,010
You think that a simple correction is enough?

486
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:56,840
No, that wasn't what I meant...but this kind of mistake
is hard to avoid, and I originally have problems
differentiating between Gim Gwang Su and Gim Hyeon Shik --

487
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,010
How can you possibly not be able to differentiate
between Gim Gwang Su and Gim Hyeon Shik?

488
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,840
Hey, hey! What are you doing
when broadcast is still ongoing?

489
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,830
Let me go!

490
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,010
Hey! How can you be regarded as a singer?

491
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,170
Let's talk outside.

492
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,840
Did you guys see that?

493
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,020
He even slammed the table. Looks like the rumor
about you having a dog attitude is true. Dog, dog!

494
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,140
Nuna, I will...

495
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,170
Outside shouldn't be able to hear right?

496
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,460
You are a dog! Dog! Dog!

497
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,050
I'm feeling really giddy.

498
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,090
You better be careful in the future!

499
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,470
Quickly, drink some water.

500
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,050
<i>So, the rumors are true...</i>

501
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,070
Miss! Do you have time?

502
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,130
I have time, but not energy.

503
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,090
Are you still angry?

504
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,170
What's wrong with that guy? He's like a crazy viper,
he must really have something wrong with his brain...

505
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,550
But, do you know?

506
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,760
If you were to say and scold bad things about
the music I liked when I was 20 years old...

507
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,510
I will feel as if I have been stripped of my youth.

508
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,090
I also didn't scold, just merely said
the wrong name accidentally...

509
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,880
For example, if someone were
to miscall Purple as Fin.K.L,

510
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,670
I will definitely go crazy, really!

511
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,170
Oh, right,

512
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,460
this is Lee Jae Hyeok's youth.

513
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,550
Listen to it on your way back.

514
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,420
~ <i>Further and further away...</i> ~

515

524
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,770
Did you catch a cold?

525
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,990
Mom, should I resign from
my job at the radio station?

526
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,630
Suit yourself.

527
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,770
You either sing at a nightclub,
or follow him your entire life.

528
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,300
Mom, how can you say such
things to your own daughter?

529
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,960
I am Purple's Sin Jin A! I am
also still alive and can still sing!

530
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,450
Did you swallow a train engine?

531
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,490
Ever since the day you became a DJ,
you haven't stopped complaining...

532
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,940
~ <i>How long more...</i> ~

533
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,850

538
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,870
eomma, I found it, I found it.

539
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,920
Oh yeah!

540
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,210
Crazy girl.

541
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,380
Look for people with stories to tell,

542
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,610
prepare for that to go on air next week.

543
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,130
See! I told you that you wrote it well.

544
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,010
Back in secondary school, I was
a writing champion, champion.

545
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,230
Fighting!

546
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,530
=Our Wonderful Radio...=

547
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,460
Wonderful Radio has a new segment to offer you,

548
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,880
'Songs that are sung for you'.

549
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,960
The first protagonist of today's new
segment is a 22 years old military man,

550
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,130
who used his precious
vacation to attend our program.

551
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,630
So, shall we listen to his story together?

552
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,630
I am Chong Kwang Tae, the Chief
of the military service in Pyeongchang.

553
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,460
It's not because of anything else but I...
have someone I really like.

554
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,010
However, she doesn't want to
accept me. I'm going crazy soon.

555
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:25,480
Last year I even ran away
from the army because of her,

556
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,950
<i>and was arrested by the police and nearly hanged...</i>

557
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,680
That shouldn't be so serious...

558
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,880
so, let us listen to his song together?

559
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,750
With my sincerity, I present to you a
song by Brown Eyed Soul's Jong Yeop called

560
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,560
- Nothing B!
- Er...

561
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,360
then shall we listen to "Nothing Better" together?

562
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,850
Hey!

563
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,210
Im Sul Ki from the department of English,

564
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:56,260
don't belittle me, I will surely be
as good or be better than you.
You just need to wait there honestly--

565
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,670
Please calm down, let us listen to "Nothing Better".

566
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,010
Angel Sul Ki, Im Sul Ki! Im Sul Ki!

567
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,880
~ <i>Just like breathing, you
always remain by my side...</i> ~

568
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,130
Soo Ki, are you okay?

569
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,400
Hey! If it's you, will you be okay?

570
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,190
From tomorrow onwards, you
must start growing angel wings.

571
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,170
~ <i>Remain here just like this without leaving...</i> ~

572
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:40,570
~ <i>Nothing better, nothing better, than you...</i> ~

573
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,280
This is really! I can't take it!

574
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,210
Chong Kwang Tae, you're dead!

575
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:59,460
Ajussi! Can you please turn the radio off?
(Ajussi - Uncle)

576
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,260
We received a call saying that they want
to sue us for fabricating a broadcasted story,

577
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:08,260
and also accused us for being able to
do anything to raise the listenership.

578
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,670
Bujangnim, this program's item is much better than
expected, if only you can give us a bit more time...
(Bujangnim - General Manager)

579
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:18,040
Of course it's good to raise the
listenership, so maybe we'll maintain the
current situation until the time for revision.

580
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,460
Or we might as well change the DJ and program
segment all at once. What do you think?

581
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,300
What?

582
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,630
Have a good thought about it.

583
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,810
Why are you here?

584
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,440
Did you get reprimanded by the higher ups?

585
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,410
Then did you think I'll get praised?

586
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,370
I'm sorry.

587
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,910
Why? Why are you sorry?

588
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,550
No, it's because of me that's why...

589
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,510
I was the one who chose the proposal for the new item.

590
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,840
It's a PD's job to choose and be responsible
for the program's segment. This time is no difference.

591
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,340
You don't need to worry. I'll be
responsible for our team till the end.

592
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,390
Try and see.

593
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:51,050
Hey, Cha Dae Geun! Can't you see
the car is going to explode soon?

594
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,800
Can't you, can't you just inspect it beforehand?

595
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,960
Can you be responsible for our late arrival?
Heavens, what time is it already?

596
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,450
I'm sorry.

597
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,090
Quickly get a taxi.

598
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,140
Really too much!

599
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,770
Really too much! How can you get a taxi here?

600
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,660
Ah!

601
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,010
Help! Help!

602
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,460
I listen to your broadcast often.

603
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,090
Ah, thank you.

604
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:38,880
Wow, your child is so cute and
your wife is also very beautiful.

605
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,840
That photo was taken really well.

606
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:51,380
May I ask, can I participate on one of your broadcast?

607
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,500
PD, this is the original manuscript.

608
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,240
She actually anyhow changed
the program. Where's Jin A?

609
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,380
She's here.

Wonderful Radio, 'Songs that are sung for you'.

612
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,870
Today's hero is a 42 years old
taxi driver, Mr. Kim Ji Hyeong.

613
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,990
So, would you please tell us your story personally?

614
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,690
Hello.

615
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,240
I wonder what story will there be today?

616
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,720
- Keep quiet.
- My name is Kim Ji Young.

617
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:37,170
There is a letter that I was
unable to send to my wife in time.

618
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,010
That is why I am here today.

619
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,010
Yun Yeong, this is Ji Hyeong.

620
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,840
It's been three years since you left us.

621
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,340
I would first like to say that I'm sorry.

622
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,950
I'm sorry for letting you experience so much hardships.

623
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:14,790
When you were alive, I didn't even write you one
letter. I'm sorry that I wasn't a considerate husband.

624
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,420
Oh right, I've prepared the song that you really liked.

625
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,460
You used to laugh at me for not being able to sing well.

626
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,870
Then listen, I'll start singing.

627
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,570
Yun Yeong,

628
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,450
Yun Yeong, our Min So...

629
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,200
The doctor said she has cancer like you.

630
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,590
I know you really miss Min So right?

631
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:06,090
I know, I know but I cannot give Min So to you.

632
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,170
I must let Min So recover,

633
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,920
to grow up and get married, and to give
birth to a grandchild who will look like you.

634
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,340
So, no matter how much you miss her,
you must leave her by my side till that happens.

635
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:29,670
I'm sorry, I'll be counting on you.

636
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,630

Hey, hey, hey. Tae Young, why did you greet him?

Forget it.

Ajussi. Please don't greet
my friend next time.

00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,710
It's only a trifle matter, there
shouldn't be a need to congratulate...

683
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,760
You know how to compose too?

684
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:43,510
Of course. I am a woman with copyrights.

685
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,600
That is really unexpected.

686
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,410
What is?

687
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,210
Aren't you of idol origins?

688
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,930
What is it with being an idol? Can't idols compose?

689
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:59,170
Nuna, why are you still here?
That guy, PD Lee is currently...

690
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,760
Hello, PD.

691
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:06,490
I'll go back to the car first.
Have a nice day.

692
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,320
He really didn't even miss a week.
What do you think this person does?

693
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,540
A florist?

694
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,800
Who cares what he does? As long as its
for certain that he will be someone very fragrant.

695
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,160
Look at how contented you are...

696
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,960
Hello. PD, this is the information
and story for today's lead person.

697
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,130
Must let Sin Jin A read this before the program begins.

698
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,010
That was chosen by eonni.

699
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,800
- Hello everybody.
- Hello.

700
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,660
Eonni, this is for you.

701
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,460
What is there for us to listen to?

702
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,010
Why? What is it?

703
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:16,050
Da Hui sent a text message to
ask us to listen to the radio.

704
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,730
Radio?

705
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,340
='Songs that are sung for you'=

706
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:28,840
Today, we welcome a very cute
secondary student to our studio.

707
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,780
Hello.

708
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:37,340
Hello. I am Yun Da Hui,
a 10th grade student.

709
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,570
Then, can you introduce to us your story and song?

710
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,140
Dad, can you hear me?

711
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,620
I'm on the radio station
that you used to love.

712
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,000
Dad, you know right?
Mom got remarried.

713
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,690
=<i>That ajussi is uglier than you.</i>=

714
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:07,620
But, he treats Mom very well.

715
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:16,670
After you passed away,
it was such a difficult time for Mom and me.

716
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:26,670
That ugly ajussi, that annoying ajussi...

717
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:33,550
He said that he is very happy to have a daughter like me.

718
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:43,230
As long as you allow it,

719
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,350
I'd like to accept that ajussi now.

720
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,440
I'm really sorry for this period of time.

721
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,390
Thank you for the gift.

722
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:09,420
Dad.

723
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:28,640
~ <i>I hope you can understand that
I can't be close to your heart.</i> ~

724
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:43,460
~ <i>Tears tell me my earnest hope.</i> ~

725
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:52,670
~ <i>I once loved, and once complained,</i> ~

726
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,360
~ <i>missing that someone</i> ~

727
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,840
~ <i>who used to love me more than anyone else.</i> ~

728
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:09,380
~ <i>Always by my side but have
never been able to get near.</i> ~

729
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:15,930
~ <i>Yes, I will complain...</i> ~

730
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,040
~ <i>Please listen to what I have to say,</i> ~

731
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:28,880
~ <i>I only require some time.</i> ~

732
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:38,460
~ <i>I once loved, and once complained,</i> ~

733
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,090
~ <i>missing that someone</i> ~

734
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:45,440
~ <i>who used to love me more than anyone else.</i> ~

735
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:54,800
~ <i>Hidden deep in my heart,</i> ~

736
00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:06,510
~ <i>yes, I once loved...</i> ~

737
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:21,170
The stories you chose were not bad.

738
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,130
That was nothing hard.

739
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,590
I thought of a question during recording.

740
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,390
What is Wonderful Radio to you?

741
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,330
A time when I can talk about my stories. I mean in the past,

742
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,760
but not anymore.

743
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:52,980
Listen to other people's stories,
to feel touched and to comfort them.

744
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:57,210
And I myself can find comfort through that.

745
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,050
I have learnt a lot.

746
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,900
I really feel like singing.

747
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:14,920
Only now then I really understand what I
should say through the help of music.

748
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,770
Nuna! Nuna! What should I do?

749
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:20,670
It's hot!

750
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:26,910
Nuna and PD, it's really not a joke.
It's totally hot and all over youtube and reports!

751
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:33,840
<i>Yes, reporter, interview is it? Sure, no problem.</i>

752
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,820
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

753
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,670
<i>Since when did you start seeing it?</i>

754
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,700
<i>Three days ago.</i>

755
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,630
<i>Three days?</i>

756
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,510
Wow, that is quite long...

757
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:43,360
This time it's really long enough.

758
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,440
Not bad.

759
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:16,010
~ <i>You are my angel, angel, angel to me. </i> ~

760
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:21,840
~ <i>Just like this, forever treasure and keep our love.</i> ~

761
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,630
~ <i>Today, you are as wonderful as yesterday,</i> ~

762
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,050
~ <i>not leaving behind even the smallest regret...</i> ~

763
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:37,040
Today's Wonderful Radio will
soon say goodbye to everyone.

764
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,130
The cool and refreshing wind
makes such a fine night.

765
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:44,050
Doesn't pork bone soup with soju
sound perfect for this kind of night?
(Soju - Native Korean distilled alcohol)

766
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,000
Wow. That's simply great.

767
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,130
There is one song that I'll like
to recommend, "Night's Starlight",

768
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,070
a song by Lee Seung Hwan.

769
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,180
-=It's Kim Hyun Shik's song.=-

770
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,250
Lee Seung Hwan's peculiar timbre gives us
a different feeling from the original song.

771
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,510
Do we have Lee Sung Hwan's version?

772
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:11,420
Would you please enjoy this song while
I bid my goodbye to everyone here.

773
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,630
I wish everyone will have a fine night.

774
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:20,380
~ <i>The night is just like your breathing,</i> ~

775
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:27,550
~ <i>that quietly wipes away my tears.</i> ~

776
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,430
~ <i>Starlight...</i> ~

777
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,810
I heard that Wonderful Radio
is very popular, hyeongnim.

778
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,880
PD Lee has gotten himself into something big.

779
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,380
Congratulations hyeongnim. This is really...

780
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:45,320
If it's like this, what about me?

781
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:56,960
Why are you like an amateur? You can't
always pull down people who are doing well.

782
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:01,380
But hyeongnim, listen to me,

783
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,150
I will be so regretful.

784
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:09,210
But, this kind of regret can be changed anytime.

785
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:12,590
Representative Lee, are you
still not familiar with this line?

786
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:18,190
If you pull Sin Jin A down now,
you'll only create nonsensical rumors.

787
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:27,700
~ <i>It obviously wasn't me who sent you away,</i> ~

788
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:32,550
~ <i>and it obviously wasn't me who left.</i> ~

789
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:37,590
PD, who do you like more?
Gim Yeon Shik or Gim Gwang Su?

790
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,760
Gim Gwang Su.

791
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,840
Then you must list Gim Gwang Su's
song names while I do the same for
Gim Yeon Shik. How about that?

792
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,170
You still want to say when you can't even
differentiate who sang "Like rain and like music".

793
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,230
Loser must grant a wish.

794
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,670
Good, good.

795
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:56,710
Right, "Like rain and like music"!

796
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:57,950
No, I'm not playing, I'm not playing...

797
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,550
10...9...8...

798
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,960
"Although I loved you", "Although I loved you"...

799
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,330
"The four seasons".

800
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,750
"When I was 30 years old".

801
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:06,270
"Watercolor painting of a rainy day".

802
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:07,830
Eh...that is not.

803
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:10,630
It was sung with Kang In Ran and Kong In Ha.

804
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,720
<i>Really good. </i>

805
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,630
Okay, okay. "The story of an old couple".

806
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:21,670
Wrong! The correct name should be
"The story of a 60 years old couple".

807
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,700
That's right, that's right.

808
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:29,050
Grant a wish! Grant a wish! Grant a wish!

809
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,630
Wait! Wait...

810
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,720
I'll change it, I'll change it.
Kim Yeon Shik's "The terminal of goodbye".

811
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,630
Bleh...you have obviously lost.

812
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,380
Is this a shop you come to often?

813
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,380
Considered so. I come here everyday.

814
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:48,920
This wine is very beneficial towards the body.

815
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,470
Today's pork bone soup is amazing.

816
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:56,590
Are you implying that yesterday's
pork bone soup wasn't any good?

817
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:03,290
But, PD, you're really handsome.

818
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,070
Do you know me?

819
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,080
Of course, the annoying guy.

820
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,490
Don't be like this, Madam Lee...

821
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,450
Wasn't it what you said?

822
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:15,030
The annoying city man.

823
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,150
Shall I introduce the both of you?

824
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,640
<i>This is PD Lee,</i>

825
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,090
and this is my mother.

826
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,150
I have always loved listening
to your radio broadcasts.

827
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,840
Although Jin A may be a little ignorant and loves
to throw tantrums, but she is actually a good kid.

828
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:39,720
If she doesn't listen, I'll
count on you to discipline her.

829
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,470
Since when did i throw tantrums? When did I?

830
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,590
You keep quiet.

831
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,810
And also, Mr. PD,

832
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,970
It's only out of concern that's why I'm saying more.

833
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,950
- I hope you do not misunderstand.
- Yes.

834
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,170
In principle, I am more against office romance.

835
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,980
I'm a bit sorry and afraid that you may
laugh at me for flaunting my daughter.

836
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:01,820
- But there is nothing I can do
because being pretty is also a kind of sin.
- Mom!

837
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,680
What are you shouting for? You frightened
me that I would have nearly dropped a child.

838
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,600
Oh my, what did I just say?

839
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,710
Be careful, be careful.

840
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,720
You must send her home safely!

841
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,790
Aigoo, aigoo. It must be really exhausting.

842
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,150
That looks really heavy.

843
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,580
<i>My head!</i>

844
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:30,960
It's a bit unexpected.

845
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,710
What's unexpected?

846
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:36,850
Nothing, its just...

847
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,500
I didn't expect you to know how
to take of others. Isn't it unexpected?

848
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,850
Of course I can take care of people!

849
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,260
I want to go home! Go Home!

850
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,090
I've to faster get home!

851
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,430
Be careful!

852
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,410
Just find a place to sit.

853
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:05,900
Right, just now I won the game but I haven't told you my wish.

854
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,500
Tell me your wish then.

855
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,370
Give me a pleasant surprise on my birthday?

856
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,560
When is your birthday?

857
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,080
It will tell you.

858
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,860
That program of yours is really good.

859
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,300
Honestly speaking,

860
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:35,110
it was my mom who gave me the idea.

861
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,790
When I was younger, the boat my dad was on

862
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,380
went missing at the ocean near Russia.

863
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,670
But, my mom said she likes that word a lot,

864
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,910
missing.

865
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,680
He's not dead, but missing.

866
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,380
Which is why my mom adorns herself everyday,

867
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,600
and not move house.

868
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:04,730
My dad also loves the way my mom sings,

869
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:07,720
so she would always be humming a song.

870
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,480
That was where I got my idea from.

871
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,240
This is the first and last gift my dad gave me.

872
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,350
Can you guess what I wrote with it?

873
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,140
What?

874
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,680
"You're My Angel".

875
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,320
My first song.

876
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,710
That song is really nice to listen to.

877
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:43,050
This is surprising, you actually praised me.

878
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,120
Jin A, your song

879
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,490
has a story behind it.

880
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,890
Of course!

881
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,560
I'm a woman with a story to tell.

882
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,340
You haven't been composing recently?

883
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,500
Not much inspiration.

884
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,860
It's like I lost something from here.

885
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,120
Here, one shot.

886
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,160
Why did you give me so much?

887
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,830
One shot!

888
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,440
Oh my, it's really spicy.

889
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,200
Do you want another cup?

890
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,650
Lee Jae Hyeok, where are you going?

891
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,630
Walk properly, did you hear me?

892
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:31,190
I'm not going anywhere.

893
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,380
1, 2, 4. 4th one.

894
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,910
2, 4, 3, 4.

895
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:40,700
That's too funny.

896
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:43,910
Hey, I drank with a celebrity.

897
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:46,020
Wait, how did we get here?

898
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,270
Which way?

899
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,220
Please give me a bottle of soju!

900
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,490
I found it, go in that direction.

901
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:57,330
Over there. Hey, celebrity, let's go.

902
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:59,880
Let's go together...

903
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,210
Get up!

904
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,160
Where are we?

905
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:26,100
Mo...motel.

906
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,940
You jerk!

907
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,290
No wonder I felt it was strange,

908
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,340
last night you kept making me drink!

909
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,660
- Calm down a bit.
- What, what, what are you doing?

910
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,190
- Where are you trying to climb? You really...

911
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,600
Wait, wait.

912
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,840
You drank so much yesterday
until you weren't acting like a person.

913
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:47,540
What? What did you say?

914
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,210
If I'm not a person then what am I?

915
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,090
Don't tell me Dae Geun and I...

916
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:54,110
- did some inhuman things here?
- No, no, no!

917
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:56,050
Things weren't like that.

918
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:57,360
You probably don't remember,

919
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,500
but when I was driving, you asked me to

920
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,590
spit and stuff like that.

921
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,410
You even scolded me a bastard and
said that you didn't want to go home.

922
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,260
Then you suddenly said you wanted to undress...

923
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,280
Bastard, there's no way
I could have acted like that!

924
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,880
Why must you lie?

925
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,070
It's the truth!

926
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,460
Omo, omo!

927
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,850
You see, see, see...

928
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,050
Panty, panty...

929
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,430
Where's your pants?

930
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:25,080
I asked you where did your pants go?

931
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,170
Annoying.

932
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,750
Yesterday you vomited 4 times
in the middle of the night!

933
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,800
That is why I turned from side to side
without being able to sleep.

934
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,990
It's so early in the morning,
where did I get this bad luck from...

935
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:35,640
and you even hit me...

936
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,810
Sometimes, whatever expressions are
also unable to make you pleased.

937
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,560
When you feel you're unable to
withstand the pressures of life,

938
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:46,500
Wonderful Radio hopes to be able to
become your family, friend or lover.

939
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:52,920
~ <i>eomma, don't give up! I will
accompany you by your side...</i> ~

941
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,920
Congratulations Miss Sin Jin A!
You are extremely popular!

942
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,300
When are you going to release a new album?

943
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,150
Actually, there are a few songs that aren't too bad...

944
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,550
So, we'll be able to hear your songs once again?

945
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,470
I would also really like to meet my fans again...

946
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,300
-='Only when you're in love then
can you understand true love.' -2065=-

947
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,460
Please don't tell anyone else.

948
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,460
Mr. Dae Geun!

949
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,010
Looks like we are really a match made in heaven.

950
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,630
'Songs that are sung for you'.

951
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:09,000
Today, we have invited our 13th guest,

952
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,410
29 years old Miss Ru Mi.

953
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,170
She labels herself as a white swan
who becomes a musician for her dream.

954
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:18,260
So, shall we listen to her story?

955
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,720
Today I would like to dedicate a song to someone

956
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,940
who is none other than DJ Miss Sin Jin A.

957
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,510
Me?

958
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,420
It's really an honor,

959
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,020
thank you.

960
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,280
For more words that I want to say,

961
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,170
I'll like to use my singing to replace it.

962
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:38,000
Then, let's listen to it together?

963
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:47,090
~ <i>Why is it that time passes
more slowly when I'm sad?</i> ~

964
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:55,220
~ <i>Why is it that time takes so long to pass by?</i> ~

965
01:08:55,590 --> 01:09:01,220
~ <i>Am I overcoming it or slowly getting used to it?</i> ~

966
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,340
~ <i>All the pacing back and forth with indecisiveness,</i> ~

967
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:09,220
~ <i>where exactly is the endpoint?</i> ~

968
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,100
PD,

969
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,970
there is someone who keeps
uploading the same video online.

970
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:18,060
~ <i>Please let me gradually</i> ~

971
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:25,060
~ <i>become stronger.</i> ~

972
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,970
No, no...it's not like that.

973
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:37,970
~ <i>Everything will change.</i> ~

974
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,970
Miss Sin Jin A,

975
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,630
<i>isn't this melody very familiar?</i>

976
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:48,260
<i>It was my first publication at
a club in Hongdae in 2002.</i>

977
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:49,760
<i>It is called "Island".</i>

978
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:53,090
In 2004, I received an invitation
to release an album, but it failed.

979
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,260
The then ultimate female group, Purple,

980
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:00,000
<i>actually plagiarized my melody.</i>

981
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,130
Miss Ru Mi,

982
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:05,510
that melody was composed by me.

983
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,860
That's right, it was composed by me...

984
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,800
<i>Seems like you made a mistake.</i>

985
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,760
-=Don't act impulsively,
quickly end the conversation.=-

986
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,800
<i>Don't you know you're wrong?</i>
-= Don't act impulsively,
quickly end the conversation. =-

987
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,440
<i>Don't you know you're wrong?</i>

988
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,260
<i>I just...</i>

989
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,800
-= Hurry! =-
<i>My reason for coming here
is to find my stolen melody.</i>

990
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:17,920
<i>My reason for coming here is to find my stolen melody.</i>

991
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,630
The melody you stole!

992
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,720
My first song...

993
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,050
Are you able to take responsibility
for what you said just now?

994
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:33,920
How are you going to prove
you composed that melody?

995
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,880
<i>I have the performance video of last time,</i>

996
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,670
and the song which I just performed myself.

997
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,170
Do you need anymore?

998
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,170
<i>"You're My Angel"?</i>

999
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,130
<i>Purple?</i>

1000
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:49,880
What a joke...

1001
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:53,760
- Hey! You liar!
- Quickly turn off the microphone.

1002
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,380
What are you talking about now?

1003
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,800
This is a live broadcast, what
do you think you're doing?

1004
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,390
<i>Nuna, calm down!</i>

1005
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,390
Miss Jin A,

1006
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,510
what exactly happened?

1007
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,550
You actually shouted and
scolded during a live broadcast,

1008
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,340
at least give me an explanation.

1009
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:23,050
So you expected me to
remain calm and composed?

1010
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:25,880
She said I plagiarized her work!

1011
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,300
The internet and mail inbox

1012
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:29,470
has the video of her past
performance circulating around.

1013
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:31,950
What exactly is the truth?

1014
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:37,050
You too...

1015
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:41,630
PD, you also...

1016
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,420
do not believe me.

1017
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:47,550
I'm leaving.

1018
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,920
Miss Jin A!

1019
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,420
Don't you even know that under that
kind of circumstances, you should have
turned off the microphone and play music?

1020
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,380
<i>Do you know the extent of the damage done?</i>

1021
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,550
What will happen to Sin Jin A?

1022
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,470
Do you really not know?

1023
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,420
From tomorrow onwards, ban her
from the program! Do you understand?

1024
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,420
Shouldn't you at least
give her a chance to explain?

1025
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:08,420
Explain what?

1026
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,650
Plagiarism?

1027
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,510
Whether or not she plagiarized,

1028
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,380
since she caused this kind of trouble,
she should have some conscience!

1029
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,880
<i>That's why I said that it is a
must to switch Jin A off the program.</i>

1030
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,550
I've mentioned before,

1031
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,990
if it is Mi Ra,

1032
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,660
where would there be such a scenario?

1033
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,550
I understand.

1034
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,990
That is why,

1035
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:32,030
is it possible to let Mi Ra join that program?

1036
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:33,430
Hyeongnim, how is that feasible?

1037
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:36,800
Like this she will become Jin A's live scapegoat...

1038
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:39,130
That is simply unreasonable.

1039
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:43,470
That's why I'm begging you.

1040
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:52,300
I understand. Since it's hyeongnim's
request, I will consider it carefully.

1041
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:57,470
- Thank you!
- I don't even know when I'll be
able to enjoy your good fortune.

1042
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,560
How should I hit this ball?

1043
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:23,630
Oh, In Yeong...

1044
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,350
=Hey! Are you okay?=

1045
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,310
=At home?=

1046
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,390
=Want me to go over and find you?=

1047
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:35,300
=You're alone at home, right?=

1048
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,800
=I better come over.=

1049
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,090
I'm fine.

1050
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:41,050
Hey! Why are you worried?

1051
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:47,760
=Hey! You're afraid I'll be worried that's why
you are holding it back and not saying, right?=

1052
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,340
=I'm really fine with that.=

1053
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:52,550
=No matter what the world says about my past,=

1054
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,170
=I am already fine with that.=

1055
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,920
=So, don't hold it in like this,=

1056
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:59,670
=voice out what you feel like saying.
Think more about yourself.=

1057
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:00,840
=Okay?=

1058
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,590
Okay, enough. Hang up.

1059
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:04,090
=Jin A...=

1060
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,880
=Sin Jin A!=

1061
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:15,800
Time really flies.

1062
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:19,300
I've known everyone for already a month.

1063
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,590
For me, the audiences are
already like close relatives.

1064
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,300
What about everyone?

1065
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,800
I'll dedicate my favorite song,

1066
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,800
a song by Lee Sin Cheol.

1067
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,510
"Super Hero".

1068
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:36,970
How was it?

1069
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:47,550
Just now that was Lee Seung Hwan's song.
You can correct it when the song is over.

1070
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,720
Was that how I said it?

1071
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,720
I'm really sorry, I will correct it.

1072
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,380
PD, when the program ends,

1073
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,550
do you want to go and eat sashimi?

1074
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,380
I'll treat.

1075
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,050
Maybe next time.

1076
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:58,550
Next time is a must!

1077
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,380
Are there any recent news about Sin Jin A?

1078
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:04,720
<i>Seems like there is no news regarding her.</i>

1079
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:09,160
<i>Don't know whether she can make a
comeback, I think it is hopeless for her.</i>

1080
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,880
Your Wonderful Radio...

1081
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,090
did you not know that it nearly died prematurely?

1082
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,630
<i>It was proceeding fine,</i>

1083
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,050
but the General Manager said that all
the program's personnel, including the PD,
Script Writer and DJ will be changed.

1084
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:30,050
Do you know how Miss Jin A
reacted after finding out?

1085
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:31,720
<i>She actually rushed into the
General Manager's office immediately!</i>

1086
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,880
She asked whether did he actually
consider about the hardworking personnel
working behind the scenes?

1087
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,760
<i>The General Manager must
have been furious at that time.</i>

1088
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,340
What's the use?

1089
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:46,720
She can't even take care of herself...

1090
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,800
Excuse me,

1091
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,510
is the Director still in a meeting?

1092
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:25,970
I've made an appointment to see him at 2 pm.

1093
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,510
Please wait for a moment.

1094
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,010
Director, Miss Sin Jin A is still...

1095
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,550
<i>Yes, I understand...</i>

1096
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:44,550
~ <i>I did not know that the past memories</i> ~

1097
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:48,010
- ~ <i>would be like this...</i> ~
- Stop, stop.

1098
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:52,220
Sounds like it's lacking feeling.

1099
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:55,760
I assure you, I'll be like a
singer who has just debuted,

1100
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,260
one who seriously composes and sings.

1101
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:02,090
- Director, please give me an opportunity, I will...
- <i>Jin A!</i>

1102
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:04,130
The present Sin Jin A

1103
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:06,720
is not comparable with the idol star of before.

1104
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,300
<i>The feeling is completely different.</i>

1105
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,030
I do not wish to say any further.

1106
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,990
Ah, yes, that song just now...

1107
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:20,630
was composed by you, right?

1108
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,380
<i>Now Infinite is the most popular.</i>

1109
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,590
No they are not, Beast is the most popular!

1110
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:33,880
- Isn't that Sin Jin A?
- Sin Jin A...

1111
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,550
That's the person who
plagiarized other people's work.

1112
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:39,880
<i>Hey! It's not the first time
you've came across such people.</i>

1113
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:43,380
She used to think so highly of herself,

1114
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:45,550
look at what she has become now.

1115
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,550
<i>That's why I say those who are artists</i>

1116
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:51,050
<i>are different compared to
the person they were before.</i>

1117
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:54,550
Hey, have you heard her attitude
and manner in the past broadcasts?

1118
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,470
It is completely disgusting, disgusting.

1119
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,130
Hey, let's go, let's go.

1120
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:04,470
She's still holding a guitar, does
she really think she is a singer?

1121
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:07,510
- Stop saying, what if she scolds us?
- Hey, hurry up!

1122
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,760
Looks like there is no performance today.

1123
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:26,670
Yes, there isn't.

1124
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,170
Recently business also hasn't been too good,

1125
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:31,970
I can't pay them to perform.

1126
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,880
Which is why I play music to pass time.

1127
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:38,010
- Are you by any chance a musician?
- Nope.

1128
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,010
I suddenly recalled a friend who
performed here 10 years ago.

1129
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:47,930
That's impossible! We've only been open
for 4 years now. It used to be a PC Bang.
(PC Bang - PC Room)

1130
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:48,910
What did you say?

1131
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,950
See for yourself if you don't believe.

1132
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:59,050
I want to switch the beauty salon, I don't like this one.

1133
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,800
You didn't even patronize that place for long.

1134
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,260
They always make me wait very long.

1135
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:07,130
Just tell them about it yourself, silly...

1136
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,260
Oh oppa, it's making me anxious.

1137
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:15,470
- People always ask me when my new album is coming out.
- Oh, new album?

1138
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:19,380
I have already spoken with the fatty, Shin Sa Dong,

1139
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,470
to let him create a song based on your style and name.

1140
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,130
- Really?
- Of course.

1141
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:26,470
<i>Move aside!</i>

1142
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:29,800
- There's still a meeting going on.
- You're playing really happily...

1143
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,970
You startled me.

1144
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:36,340
- PD Lee, what is this about?
- Miss Ru Mi,

1145
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,840
- ten years ago is it?
- Yes?

1146
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,510
You said you performed "Island" in 2002 is that so?

1147
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:47,170
Yes! But why do you suddenly ask this?

1148
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,840
A club that opened only in 2007,

1149
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,510
yet you could perform there in 2002?

1150
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:57,880
PD Lee, what exactly are you trying to do?

1151
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,800
You suddenly rushed into other people's office.
Do you have any manners?

1152
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,510
Representative Lee,

1153
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,170
how could you do something like that?

1154
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:08,050
Just because of a scumbag like you,

1155
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:11,220
an innocent person who wanted to use
sincerity to host the radio program was wasted!

1156
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,110
Scumbag?

1157
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:16,010
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Call Sin Jin A back.

1158
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:22,510
<i>Hey, PD Lee! PD Lee!</i>

1159
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:29,670
<i>- Faster sleep.
- Hyeong, you really don't understand my heart.</i>

1160
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:32,550
- Why is it whatever I say you still...
- Sleep!

1161
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:36,720
I'm sorry for frightening you, Mr. driver.

1162
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,470
It's all right, it's all right. I can
see that he isn't in a very good mood.

1163
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:44,880
- I'll play a cheerful and lighthearted
song for you guys to hear.
- Sure, that's fine.

1164
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:55,720
Oh, this song used to be famous, who sang it?

1165
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,130
- Should I give you a hint?
- Okay.

1166
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:59,840
A very famous group.

1167
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,260
The predecessor of idol groups as well as
the beginning of idols and then the end.

1168
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:07,880
- Purple...
- Purple!

1169
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:12,220
- Purple, Purple...correct, Purple! I know them.
- So you still remember...

1170
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:16,670
I still remember their dance.
This, this and this, right?

1171
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:19,880
- I also know.
- Sleep!

1172
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:23,590
This is how you dance it, isn't it?

1173
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:26,010
Taking advantage of the good atmosphere,
let me bring you to a fun place.

1174
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:30,010
- You can look forward to it.
- Just drive.

1175
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,590
- Mom.
- Why did you come in?

1176
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:04,090
I came by to see whether there
is anything I can help you with.

1177
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:08,090
This is so unlikely, I'm so touched.

1178
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:10,260
If there's nothing, fine.

1179
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,260
How is the matter about plagiarism coming along?

1180
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:19,760
Not very good. Mom, how about we...

1181
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,760
drink some alcohol?

1182
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:26,260
Are you crazy? But how come
it's so much to my intention?

1183
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,920
Cheers!

1184
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:40,760
Eat some side dishes, or else
you will harm your stomach.

1185
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,470
- No...
- You learnt your dad's bad habits.

1186
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:47,800
I've got a question for you.

1187
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,970
Why is there no news about PD Lee?

1188
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:54,630
How did you know? We even quarreled...

1189
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:58,800
It doesn't seem that way...

1190
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,470
It's not what you think, we are
completely unsuitable for each other.

1191
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,970
Your character is exactly like your dad.

1192
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,590
Do you still think a lot about dad?

1193
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,840
Yes, occasionally.

1194
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:15,880
Are you still waiting for him?

1195
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,670
Yes...

1196
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,630
If your father comes back,

1197
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:26,090
I really want to boast to him
how well I raised you by myself.

1198
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:29,800
- Mom.
- You do not need to worry about me.

1199
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:34,590
Believe me, keep your hopes up!

1200
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,880
Okay, I believe.

1201
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,050
You should have told me earlier,

1202
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:45,380
I thought you already promised
a date with the children.

1203
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:50,760
But you know...you've
encountered some problems recently.

1204
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:55,260
The parents have quite a few opinions about it.

1205
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,760
You experienced a problem on the program and plus
the plagiarism incident, I'm in a really tough spot.

1206
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,920
Your mom said you didn't allow
her to tell me where you were,

1207
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,420
I had to beg for a long time
before she finally told me.

1208
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:27,010
Thinking about it, I realized I have never
placed myself in your shoes to face the problem.

1209
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:30,630
I should have believed in you.

1210
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:35,340
I'm sorry.

1211
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:40,340
Don't worry,

1212
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:44,010
I have already gotten over it.

1213
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:48,340
Not being able to host the radio
program, and not being able to sing,

1214
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,340
were the result of me messing up.

1215
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:00,380
Don't give up on singing.

1216
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,880
Remember you once said...

1217
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,630
That you already understood what you should sing.

1218
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,340
<i>Continue singing.</i>

1219
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:34,420
sunbaenim, so you're actually the producer?
(sunbaenim - respected senior/mentor)

1220
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:37,880
Nothing is certain yet, I haven't
even prepared myself and,

1221
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,170
it is a bit abrupt... Wow, hyeong!

1222
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:48,590
Hey, work that doesn't receive
remuneration always feels extremely practical.

1223
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:52,130
Sin Jin A, welcome to my world. It's Dream Factory!

1224
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:00,670
Then, let's begin.

1225
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:04,170
<i>1, 2, 3, 4.</i>

1226
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:08,300
~ <i>I did not know that the past memories</i> ~

1227
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,420
~ <i>would be like this,</i> ~

1228
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,200
~ <i>gradually...</i> ~

1229
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,900
This is the feeling.

1230
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:21,200
~ <i>What has obviously already been discarded,</i> ~

1231
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,800
~ <i>is now slowly being recalled.</i> ~

1232
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:27,470
~ <i>I have obviously already forgotten...</i> ~

1233
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:32,260
~ <i>I put my dedication and heart
and soul into loving you,</i> ~

1234
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:35,100
~ <i>I put my dedication, without
retaining any effort to hurt you,</i> ~

1235
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:40,260
~ <i>I put my dedication, and I want to
fall into the river of love once again.</i> ~

1236
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:45,670
~ <i>Not once forgetting the bitterness of love,</i> ~

1237
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:48,670
~ <i>not forgiving myself for
once treating you indifferently,</i> ~

1238
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:53,000
~ <i>I want you to know how much I miss you...</i> ~

1239
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:58,050
~ <i>I put my dedication and heart
and soul into loving you,</i> ~

1240
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:01,100
~ <i>I put my dedication, without
retaining any effort to hurt you,</i> ~

1241
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:06,900
~ <i>I put my dedication, and I want to
fall into the river of love once again.</i> ~

1242
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:11,550
~ <i>Not once forgetting the bitterness of love,</i> ~

1243
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:16,200
~ <i>not forgiving myself for
once treating you indifferently,</i> ~

1244
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:20,250
~ <i>I want you to know how much I miss you...</i> ~

1245
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:23,720
=I sincerely apologize.=

1246
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:27,220
Has Ru Mi's problem been settled?

1247
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:30,220
Yes. I've already told her to
remain abroad for 2 to 3 months.

1248
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:33,880
=I didn't expect it to cause
such a serious consequence.=

1249
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:38,380
It really leaves me speechless.

1250
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:41,550
You also better not make any mistakes, understand?

1251
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,880
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- Go out.

1252
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,550
=This matter arose all because of me,=

1253
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:51,760
=it is unrelated to anyone else.=

1254
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,880
=That is what I'll like to announce.=

1255
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:59,050
<i>There are so much silly incidents in the office...</i>

1256
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:05,850
Not bad...the atmosphere is
harsh and awkward enough.

1257
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:07,720
Just get to the main topic.

1258
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:10,590
Why must you have such a grim attitude?

1259
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:14,840
Since your sudden visit last time,

1260
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:17,340
<i>I learnt and understood a lot.</i>

1261
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:19,880
That's why this time, aren't
I trying to help you guys?

1262
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:27,510
Is this regarding the public broadcast
event of the 1000th episode?

1263
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,670
Television and radio will have live broadcasts.

1264
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,470
Let's use Representative Lee's manpower to arrange.

1265
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:41,380
That's a good idea,

1266
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:44,670
but I will decide the list of appearances,

1267
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,970
and of course you do not need to
worry about Representative Lee's people.

1268
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:51,510
That is of course, you're the PD.

1269
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:56,380
But I'm very curious what
hidden card you have in your hands...

1270
01:30:57,090 --> 01:30:57,970
It's Miss Sin Jin A.

1271
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:03,090
No...no, but even if the matter has been settled,

1272
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,090
isn't it a bit too early?

1273
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,380
I will submit my proposal plan.

1274
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,590
- Then, I'll take my leave.
- Hey, PD Lee.

1275
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,300
Hey, PD Lee!

1276
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:12,220
Hey, you...

1277
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,130
PD Lee...

1278
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:29,340
Do you think the blow is greater if the
radio station has one less capable PD?

1279
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:33,670
Or if the people controlling the program

1280
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:39,880
such as the DJ and others leave
would deal a greater blow?

1281
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:43,130
Representative Lee,

1282
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,510
are you trying to threaten me?

1283
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,090
It seems that way.

1284
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:02,420
Go ahead and use Sin Jin A,

1285
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:06,260
but wager this.

1286
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,920
Give me my handphone.

1287
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,260
Here it is.

1288
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:21,760
<i>Where did Yong Shik oppa go?</i>

1289
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:23,920
<i>Representative Lee was looking
for him so he left hastily.</i>

1290
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:26,260
<i>He didn't even tell me my schedule for today.</i>

1291
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:27,760
<i>He asked you to wait for a while.</i>

1292
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,260
Mi Ra,

1293
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,260
Have you been getting on well?

1294
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:40,840
You actually came to find me. Is there anything?

1295
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:45,670
I...have rumors about being
from a girl's home right?

1296
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:47,220
I don't really want to listen.

1297
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,970
That is not a rumor.

1298
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:53,420
During my Secondary 2 school days,
I was on the way home after being dismissed

1299
01:32:53,420 --> 01:33:00,220
when I saw my stepfather abusing my mother.

1300
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:02,340
I had to stop him no matter what...

1301
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:06,720
But when I withdrew my actions, I discovered...

1302
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,510
that I had already killed him.

1303
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,010
It was the day before our last concert,

1304
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:18,800
when a reporter called and said that
he wanted to expose that incident.

1305
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,590
Jin A said that,

1306
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:28,510
as long as Purple disbands,
only then can we stop that report.

1307
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,130
She said to let her see me being
branded as a murderer my whole life,

1308
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,550
is something she couldn't do.

1309
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:42,670
What's the point of you
coming to tell me this now?

1310
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:43,920
<i>I do not care.</i>

1311
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,050
I have to go now.

1312
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,130
Mi Ra,

1313
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,590
don't hate Jin A so much.

1314
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,760
I said I do not care.

1315
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,090
Please sign your autograph.

1316
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:23,550
You must treasure Sin Jin A's historic
comeback album like it's a family heirloom.

1317
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:28,880
Oh right, about the matter I mentioned
regarding the radio station's reinstatement...

1318
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,880
I already said I don't want to work there...

1319
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:37,050
Very soon it will be Wonderful Radio's
1000 episode special broadcast,

1320
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:41,220
I hope that will be Miss Jin A's comeback stage.

1321
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,380
I don't have the confidence.

1322
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:49,550
Why? The accomplishments of
Wonderful Radio are all because of you.

1323
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:53,380
So, I hope you will definitely stand on that stage.

1324
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,720
I am now formally inviting
you using my status as PD.

1325
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,720
I'll count on you.

1326
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:07,050
Oh, and this is my present for you.
Take a look at it when you're home.

1327
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,050
<i>Hey, singer Sin Jin A!</i>

1328
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,000
Here, I also have a gift for you.

1329
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:15,380
Hey, this...

1330
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,880
Are you trying to demonstrate the
strength of your wrist infront of me?

1331
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:19,720
Gift, my gift.

1332
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:23,220
It's okay, it's okay...

1333
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:46,340
=<i>Hyeong, must we really do it like this?</i>=

1334
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:48,550
=<i>What's wrong? Didn't you make a promise?</i>=

1335
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:50,970
=<i>- But hyeong...
- Enough nonsense, quick catch up.</i>=

1336
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:52,240
=<i> - Let's start. </i>
- It's not like this...=

1337
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:57,340
=Hyeong, wait! One more time, wait...=

1338
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:25,380
=Hyeong! I really can't do it!=

1339
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:29,510
=Will she like it even if I do this?=

1340
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:33,130
=<i>Just believe me. A split second of embarrassment
can guarantee you a lifetime of love.</i>=

1341
01:36:33,130 --> 01:36:35,970
=<i>Come, it's the 4th take.</i>=

1342
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:43,090
=<i>Does it really have to be like this?</i>=

1343
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:45,720
=<i>Of course, didn't you promise me?</i>=

1344
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,930
=Hyeong, just wait and see.
I must take revenge on you.=

1345
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:51,090
=Hyeong, you know that I really can't sing...=

1346
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:53,800
=<i>You're a grown man, why are
you going back on your word?</i>=

1347
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,840
Hey! Don't you know
how to bid farewell?

1348
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:29,510
Ajussi! Can you stop playing
songs that are so old?

1349
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:32,470
You, this...this...don't you
know whose song this is?

1350
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,800
Whose song?

1351
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:37,010
This...how should I phrase it?

1352
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:39,510
The predecessor of predecessors,

1353
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:42,720
The start of idols...and then the end.

1354
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:45,220
An eternal evil spirit,

1355
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:47,720
and she also doesn't age. Do you know Purple...

1356
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,880
This is Purple's "You're My Angel".

1357
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,720
Ajussi, let's just go quickly.

1358
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,180
Hello?

1359
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:12,720
Hello!

1360
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:18,430
What?

1361
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,800
<i>I love you, Sin Jin A!</i>

1362
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:32,840
<i>Sin Jin A!</i>

1363
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:15,340
I have already confirmed the
program's performance sequence.

1364
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:17,260
Do you really have to do this?

1365
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:19,470
Don't you what kind of person
Representative Lee is?

1366
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:22,300
You'll only hurt yourself if
you continue on like this!

1367
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:27,380
General Manager,

1368
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:31,800
I want to do the program
according to my wishes.

1369
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:40,220
I'm sorry.

1370
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:46,630
eonni!

1371
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:49,630
eonni...

1372
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:53,680
How have you been?

1373
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:55,680
You've become more beautiful.

1374
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:57,840
It was tough, wasn't it?

1375
01:39:58,010 --> 01:40:00,840
It was tough, because you weren't around.

1376
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:08,380
Eonni, hurry up. Yong Shik oppa
wants you to get out quickly.

1377
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:17,300
Where did you get this from?

1378
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:20,630
Oh, at the terminal...

1379
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:24,840
But, so what if she releases a new album?
It can't change anything as it is over for her.

1380
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,180
But...will Sin Jin A really
perform at this public broadcast?

1381
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:49,720
If she really comes, Representative Lee
will surely not give up so easily.

1382
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:00,340
Oppa, its me.

1383
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,300
I'll be there soon.

1384
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:04,010
=Okay, come quickly.=

1385
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:06,000
That...oppa.

1386
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:08,220
=Why? Tell me, what is it? Why, why, why...=

1387
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:10,470
It's regarding Jin A going on stage today.

1388
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:13,800
=No need to worry, I'll see what
to do about it, believe me.=

1389
01:41:14,010 --> 01:41:16,300
No, it's not like that...

1390
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:22,340
- =What's wrong?=
- I no longer bother whether
or not Jin A goes onto the stage.

1391
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:23,840
=What are you talking about?=

1392
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:25,550
=Don't talk nonsense.=

1393
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:30,010
=And Mi Ra, this isn't just about you.
It also concerns my self-esteem.=

1394
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:33,050
=Furthermore, even if Sin Jin A comes, there
is no way she'll be able to stand on the stage.=

1395
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:34,550
=Do you understand? I'm hanging up!=

1396
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:35,880
Oppa. Oppa!

1397
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,180
Eonni, we have to faster go.
Come out quickly!

1398
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:48,510
- Have the guests being checked?
- Yes.

1399
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,340
Hey, did you know that Miss Jin A is here?

1400
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:57,550
If you're glad then at least smile a bit...

1401
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:00,380
Okay, it's the last commercial.

1402
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:01,260
Okay.

1403
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:06,050
1...2...cue!

1404
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:18,470
Hello everybody, today we finally usher in

1405
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:20,260
Wonderful Radio's 1000 episode.

1406
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:24,220
Thank you everyone for being able to
attend this rather significant activity today.

1407
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:27,880
Today's spectators also consists of a lot of

1408
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:29,760
lead characters who had shared
their life experiences with us before.

1409
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,720
Im Sul Ki! Im Sul Ki!

1410
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,940
Wonderful Radio, wonderful life,

1411
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,200
will now officially begin.

1412
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:39,720
I heard that you released a new album.
I should have at least congratulated you

1413
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,880
through Kakao Talk, but I was so busy
that I forgot about it.
(Kakao Talk - messaging app for phones)

1414
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:46,180
I have to prepare for the performance,
can you just come to the main point?

1415
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:48,380
What's so urgent?

1416
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:57,340
When Purple disbanded, I should
have insisted keeping you.

1417
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,680
Mi Ra is good at everything,
except that she doesn't have the tenacity.

1418
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:05,510
But you do.

1419
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:11,680
Your tenacity of being able to bet
on the PD's life and go on stage,

1420
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:14,300
is something Mi Ra is unable
to do. It's a little regretful.

1421
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:18,930
What did you just say?

1422
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:21,090
PD's life?

1423
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,510
PD Lee's life.

1424
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,260
Nuna!

1425
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,220
Your dongsaeng is really tall.
(dongsaeng - younger brother)

1426
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:35,590
<i>I will appreciate it well.</i>

1427
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:10,470
PD, something big went wrong.
Jin A nuna is now...

1428
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:10,840
Hurry, hurry...

1429
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:15,200
Why? What's wrong with Jin A nuna?

1430
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:29,970
What's wrong? Faster tell me what's wrong!

1431
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:33,800
Why didn't you tell me what
you wagered on this stage?

1432
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:37,300
Do you think my heart will feel
comfortable by you doing this?

1433
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:39,800
I cannot step on this stage.

1434
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,300
Are you running away?

1435
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:51,090
Have you not thought about the
spectators who are waiting to hear you sing?

1436
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,260
More importantly, those who
support you are waiting for you.

1437
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:59,380
Purple disbanded and the
accusation of plagiarism was fake...

1438
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,130
Do you think by sacrificing yourself,
you'll be able to help others?

1439
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:21,050
Just sing, do it for yourself,

1440
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:25,470
and...do it for me.

1441
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:13,930
Oh, mom.

1442
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:16,590
=My princess, did you remember to eat?=

1443
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:19,930
No...

1444
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:22,840
=Hey! You have to eat in order to sing well...=

1445
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:29,510
=Jin A, mom and dad will be here to hear you sing,=

1446
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:33,050
=so don't be nervous and do well.
Do you understand?=

1447
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:37,680
=Wretch, why are you not saying anything?=

1448
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:43,970
=Our Jin A, faster get over it and come home
soon. Tonight, let's drink till our fill, okay?=

1449
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:47,720
- I understand.
- =What?=

1450
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:50,590
- I said I understand. Let's hang up.
- =Fighting!=

1451
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:11,550
Prepare the lines.

1452
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:33,200
Next, we will like to invite the
last guest of our second segment.

1453
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:42,970
Speaking about Wonderful Radio,
we certainly cannot forget to mention her, right?

1454
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:48,630
Since the beginning of Wonderful Radio till
now, she has always been a guardian by our sides.

1455
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:22,970
Only until not long ago, she has
always been the center of Wonderful Radio.

1456
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:25,970
She was also once the leader
of Purple, Miss Sin Jin A.

1457
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,300
Please welcome her with a
warm round of applause.

1458
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:47,840
Hello. To be able to once again
greet everyone in Wonderful Radio,

1459
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,510
makes me really happy. I am singer Sin Jin A.

1460
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:03,380
During the time when Purple was active
and when I was hosting Wonderful Radio,

1461
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:10,010
I used to often say 'thank you'
and 'I love you' to everyone.

1462
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:14,510
Actually, those were only what
were written in the script,

1463
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:20,720
and not because of my sincerity.
The reason for me returning here is because...

1464
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:26,300
I feel that I can now really
sincerely say to everyone

1465
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:33,600
thank you, and I love you.

1466
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:37,510
To me, Wonderful Radio is a kind of love.

1467
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:45,630
After leaving here in that way, I have
really missed this stage and everyone as well.

1468
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:51,800
Everyone...thank you.

1469
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:54,600
I love you.

1470
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:05,550
Next, I'll like to perform for everyone
my song called "Again". Thank you.

1471
01:51:18,050 --> 01:51:19,380
Where are you going?

1472
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,550
Come back quickly, this is a live broadcast.

1473
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,720
<i>Turn off the lights!</i>

1474
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:12,760
<i>Wait. What do you think you're doing?</i>

1475
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:19,590
Hyeongnim, hyeongnim...do you
think I'm doing a non-profitable sale?

1476
01:53:21,550 --> 01:53:27,470
From today onwards, our DJ and
everyone else will withdraw from SBS!
(SBS - South Korean television and radio network)

1477
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:32,380
- Withdraw then.
- All to be withdrawn!

1478
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:38,470
- What did you say?
- I asked you to withdraw everyone.

1479
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:43,930
Even without you, there is a whole row of people
who wants to collaborate with us. Do you know?

1480
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:50,510
You just try and see. I will ban everyone from
your company from entering the television station.

1481
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,180
Hyeongnim, that wasn't what I meant...

1482
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:59,180
- Wait...
- Please go out, please go out.

1483
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:01,340
- Hyeongnim, please don't misunderstand my intention.
- Please go out.

1484
01:54:01,510 --> 01:54:05,840
I will wait for you at the cafe near the entrance.

1485
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:09,010
Aigoo, not like he's a hooligan.

1486
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:41,840
I've searched for you for a long time.

1487
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:50,010
But then, what kind of relationship do we have?

1488
01:55:51,970 --> 01:55:54,590
We are not meeting with the
identities of PD and DJ, right?

1489
01:55:58,130 --> 01:55:59,430
Yes.

1490
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:05,590
What kind of PD would even bet this on a ex-DJ?

1491
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:20,220
This...is what the General Manager gave you.

1492
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:25,800
I also have something to give you.

1493
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:13,130
Here, house beat...

1494
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:17,130
and to cultivate the mood, there
will be some rock and then shouting...

1495
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:19,970
How was that?

1496
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:24,630
Yes, yes...I also don't feel this is very good.

1497
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:30,130
Then let's take a look at this. Here, there's
another one. Here...a sorrowful lyrical song.

1498
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:35,130
The prelude will be 'I love you, I love you'.
Baek Ji Young originally wanted
this song but I refused and hid it,

1499
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:37,000
to keep it for you.

1500
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:39,600
Just 3 minutes. Just 3 minutes.

1501
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:43,010
Remake of senior Lee Mi Ja's

1502
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:45,590
best-selling song, "Miss Dong Baek".

1503
01:57:45,590 --> 01:57:48,300
This is the hip-hop version. This part...

1504
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:51,470
~ Dong Baek ~...I used the staggered beat here.

1505
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:54,260
~ <i>With 200 people standing in a row,
let them all wear shorts.</i> ~

1506
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:57,340
~ <i>Miss...Dong...Baek...</i> ~

1507
01:57:57,340 --> 01:58:01,800
This song really causes people
to have goose-bumps, right?

1508
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:05,900
- You've worked hard.
- No, no, no! Wait...it's not like that.

1509
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,020
Jin A!

1510
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:10,690
=This is a beautiful early morning,
I am Gim Jang Wan.=

1511
01:58:10,690 --> 01:58:13,440
=Hello everybody, this is
Love Game's Pak So Hyeon.=

1512
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:16,230
=The next song I'm going to broadcast
is an  extremely special song.=

1513
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:19,810
=She got rid of the social stigma of
plagiarism and has finally started over.=

1514
01:58:19,810 --> 01:58:22,270
=- She was once Purple's leader...
- Once Purple's leader.=

1515
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:25,150
