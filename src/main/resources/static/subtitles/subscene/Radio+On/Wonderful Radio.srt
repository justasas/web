1
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,200
=It's another happy morning.
How are you? I'm Gim Jang Wan.=

2
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,570
=The drizzle outside the window
seems beautiful too...=

3
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,740
=This is Pak So Hyeon's 'Love Game'.
Pak So Hyeon joins you in today's program.=

4
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,280
=Let us enjoy a wonderful time together...=

5
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,700
=I'm the host of Wonderful Radio, Sin Jin A.=

6
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,030
=My dear listeners, thank you
for accompanying me all this while...=

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,500
-=Wonderful Radio=-

8
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,150
Here you go.

9
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,780
Thank you.

10
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,700
Aigoo...  our hope, you are tired too, right?
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)

11
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,490
I'm all right.

12
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,200
Don't drink too much coffee.

13
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,700
You're going to be 30 years old soon.
All of your hair is going to be white before you know it.

14
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,110
Wait until I release my new album.
I'll visit the hair salon everyday.

15
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,820
Your album? What a joke.

16
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,610
The script for the third
and fourth segments.

17
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,900
Who are they?

18
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,900
Colpi Girls.

19
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,360
Didn't they say they invited Dal Shabet?

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Our program should also invite those
currently popular kids. Please.

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,780
We're already lucky to get Colpi Girls
to appear in our program.

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,930
Get in quickly.

23
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,200
Next week, please do me a favor
and invite a male idol group.

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,320
Looks really alike. Looks really alike.

25
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,910
Hello! We are the Colpi Girls.

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,200
You all are really pretty.
I hope we have an enjoyable time today.

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,400
Yes, we will.

28
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,980
Giving a good greeting is the most crucial.

29
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,900
When I was still a member of Purple, I felt that
meeting sunbaes was harder than going on stage.
(sunbae - senior, mentor)

30
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,570
- Eonni, you were a singer?
- Purple?
(Eonni - older sister)

31
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,400
No way.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,420
Don't you know Purple?

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,900
- Eonni. We're going on air soon, get ready.
- Okay.

34
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,070
=Power FM.=

35
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,070
The third and fourth segments of
Wonderful Radio will be done together
with the new female group, Colpi Girls.

36
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,240
Hello everybody! We are the Colpi Girls.

37
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,100
They're a really cheerful and energetic group.

38
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,950
Their high vitality is like carps in
a whirl that are rushing to breed.

39
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,880
They are extremely impetuous,

40
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,580
<i>but are also an extremely
ignorant yet innocent group.</i>

41
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,370
Thank you!

42
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,920
So, for the first song of today,
we'll start off with a song from Colpi Girls.

43
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,180
"Get Out Boy".

44
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,880
It seems that you don't know Purple.

45
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,610
What year were you girls born in?

46
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,090
- 1991.
- I was born in 1994.

47
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,820
Year 2004, Republic of South Korea...

48
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,030
Oh, damn!

49
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,950
I knew it would be like this.
What should I do? What should I do?

50
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,570
Be quiet!

51
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,130
Really, shut up will you?

52
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,450
Hyeong!
(Hyeong - older brother)

53
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,420
This song is sure to be a hit.

54
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,450
Sin Jin A is here! Sin Jin A!

55
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,180
- Sin Jin A?
- Sin Jin A.

56
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,260
<i>Omo!</i>
(Omo - oh my)

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,470
Please, just wait a second.

58
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,470
Let's talk! Didn't you say you were
going to give that song to me?

59
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,850
Quick, go in!

60
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,680
- Hey!
- Wait a minute!

61
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,300
Wait, don't be impulsive!

62
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,650
Oppa!
(Oppa - older brother)

63
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,570
Come out.

64
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,650
Oppa, come out now!

65
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,530
<i>Oppa!</i>

66
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,950
Jin A.

67
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,940
I understand that you're very angry.

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,780
I completely understand.

69
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,910
However...

70
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,200
It was my only choice.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,450
The more it is like this,
the more we have to be reasonable.

72
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,030
Didn't you say that song was
specifically written for me?

73
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,610
Yes, but...

74
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,450
After the lyrics were written,

75
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,950
I realized that the song is
perfect for idols. Idols!

76
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,700
Oppa!

77
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,700
Jin A.

78
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,650
At the beginning of next month,

79
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,510
my fourth child will be born.

80
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,900
Furthermore, they're twins. I have to earn
money for their powdered milk and diapers!

81
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,720
So what if it is just one song?
I want to earn it even if it is just 100 dollars. This is reality...

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
More importantly,

83
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,740
idols are the current trend.

84
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,740
You really disappoint me.

85
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,240
From now on, I won't accept the songs you
compose even if you give them to me for free.

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,570
Goodbye.

87
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Jin A.

88
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,450
Hey!

89
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,110
What is my schedule for tomorrow?

90
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,280
Nuna, I'll send you a text message
about it when I get home.
(Nuna - older sister)

91
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Why do you want to send a text?
Just tell me now.

92
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,370
Nuna, we're very lucky and have
a solo concert tomorrow.

93
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,060
At the Sangmun Elementary School's
24th class graduates reunion.

94
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,190
We're planned to perform there.

95
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,860
Hey! Who do you think I am?

96
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,360
What? I'm going to sing at
Sangmun Elementary School's
24th class graduates reunion?

97
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,950
Cancel it!

98
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,360
My credit card's debt
deadline is approaching,

99
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,900
and in fact these 3 days I have
been using soap to wash my hair.

100
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,570
You... didn't I tell you that I will
be releasing a music album soon?

101
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,030
Oh, you're back?

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,150
Hello auntie.

103
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,240
Dae Geun, you're here?

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,070
You've worked hard.
Have a meal before you leave.

105
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,610
Okay!

106
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,880
Hey...

107
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,270
Oh yes, auntie. I have to go back
to adjust tomorrow's schedule.

108
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,200
I'll come by and have a meal next time.

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,570
Bye.

110
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,150
Dae Geun, have a meal then go...

111
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,030
You... wretch.

112
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,400
<i>Why are you so fierce to Dae Geun?</i>

113
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,070
Where is there still such a good kid like him?

114
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,530
You must treat him better, wretch.

115
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,900
<i>You can't even give him his wages on
time & you still treat him like that?</i>

116
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,630
Just rest a while, why do you work till so late?

117
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,900
After resting enough, it's a must to
continue working hard to earn money.

118
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,530
I really don't know what to do about you.

119
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,450
There isn't even a single customer!
Isn't it good to close the shop and rest?

120
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,030
Rest, what rest?

121
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,570
Why is it so hard to tie...

122
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,280
Welcome! Please come inside.

123
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,490
abeoji, come and have a sit here.
(abeoji - father)

124
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,320
You see, here comes 6 more people!

125
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,410
<i>Daughter-in-law, come quickly.</i>

126
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,520
<i>Aigoo...really pretty.</i>

127
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,530
This is the vicinity's most famous shop.

128
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,070
What should we eat?

129
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,650
I'll get another menu for you,

130
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,150
please wait for awhile.

131
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,450
You must eat more later...

132
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,200
Aish, you wretch.

133
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Done.

134
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,320
=To me, there are two Christmas in one year.=

135
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,490
=Once in December,=

136
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,820
=and once in June.=

137
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,820
=This week,=

138
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,570
=is my self-appointed midsummer Christmas.=

139
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,570
=During Christmas this June,=

140
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,240
=I haven't confirmed=

141
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,780
=what wish I want to make=

142
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,950
=to Santa Claus.=

143
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,950
What about you?

144
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,950
Do you want to find

145
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,110
a wishing box together with me

146
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
and place June's wishes in one at a time?

147
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,610
<i>Right now,</i>

148
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:44,280
=let us make our wishes towards
the seemingly bored Santa.=

149
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,280
Today's Christmas,

150
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,150
please don't let me be alone again.

151
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,110
The second segment of Wonderful Radio will now
use the writing method to interact with the listeners.

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,860
Humans themselves are what causes desperation,

153
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,380
and they are also what changes desperation into hope.

154
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,590
<i>Listener 2065, thank you for sending in an
exciting quotation with beautiful fresh flowers.</i>

155
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,610
Next, lets listen to a requested song.

156
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:18,900
<i>After School's...</i>

157
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,360
-=Requested song: After School's "Love Love Love"=-

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,740
-=Requested song: After School's "Love Love Love"=-

159
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,280
PD, can I also request one song today?
(PD - Program Director)

160
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,200
Purple's "You're My Angel".

161
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,530
<i>PD Yun Ji Seon who has been
working together with us for 4 years,</i>

162
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,360
has to temporary say goodbye to us

163
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,740
because she is going into labor.

164
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,490
<i>This is to show my gratitude to PD Yun.</i>

165
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,820
I wish that everything proceeds smoothly for you.

166
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,900
Aigoo...she actually dare to use her past song

167
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,070
for broadcast.

168
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,110
You were looking for me?

169
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:00,820
Sit.

170
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,950
It's been a while.

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,110
Let's be straightforward,

172
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,110
you need to take over the program, Wonderful Radio.

173
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,900
Are you talking about Yun sunbae's program?
(sunbae - senior/mentor)

174
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,200
Frankly speaking,

175
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,740
the listenership of this program is a complete mess!

176
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,110
I estimate that there will be a meeting
very soon to discuss the issue of DJ replacement.

177
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,820
But no matter how you say it, that program
was created with Yun sunbae's painstaking effort...

178
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,820
That's true,

179
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,360
but the listening rate is only 2%.

180
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,070
<i>I will speak with PD Yun,</i>

181
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,700
so you take over and turn the situation around.

182
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,710
Lock the door before leaving.

183
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,290
Yes.

184
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,260
Remember to cultivate a good habit and go home early,

185
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,280
=Okay?=

186
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,160
Have a safe trip.

187
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,950
Hyeong, you're leaving already?

188
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,810
Didn't you say you were going to bring me the album?

189
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,090
I'm sorry, I'll bring it for you next time.

190
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,530
You cannot keep forgetting...

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,150
I know, I know already. Sorry, and have a safe trip.

192
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,320
Hyeong, why did you come here?

193
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,990
Aren't you supposed to come by next week to be our PD?

194
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,930
Wonderful?

195
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,140
Baekhwaju?
(Baekhwaju - wine made of 100 varieties of flowers)

196
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,880
Just give anything.

197
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,990
But how come it's you who's coming?

198
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,720
Our program doesn't allow you
to broadcast songs as you like.

199
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,740
How's the DJ?

200
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,960
You mean Jin A?

201
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,900
She's treated as a princess.

202
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,610
I seriously hate that style of people.

203
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,910
I presume Jin A also hates people like you.

204
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
Maybe.

205
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,360
Do you really need to make the schedules so rushing?

206
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,400
Nuna, do you remember that
whenever I step on the brake,

207
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,240
our car makes a very weird sound?

208
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,890
I went and repaired it at the
repair shop today, now listen to it...

209
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,360
Hey! Cha Dae Geun!

210
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,780
<i>Should I give her a call?</i>

211
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,970
<i>Oh, eonni.
(eonni - older sister)</i>

212
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,990
eonni...

213
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,940
- Quickly, quickly. Why are you only here now?
- Do you have makeup remover?

214
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,600
My makeup is totally ruined.

215
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,110
I heard that the new PD has a
character that is as bad as a dog.

216
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,970
I also heard that, like a dog.

217
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,650
<i>He came so early?</i>

218
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,270
He was here since just now...

219
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,240
Hello, I am Sin Jin A's manager, Cha Dae Geun.

220
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,520
- Rumors always...
- What time is it already?

221
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,950
Why are you so late? How do you feel about
making us wait here for Miss Sin Jin A for half an hour?

222
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,950
That is because there was traffic congestion and also...

223
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,150
Before your DJ highness arrived, we roughly
got familiarized with one another.

224
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,530
A large portion of the program's
topics can be reluctantly accepted,

225
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,820
but there is a problem.

226
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,990
'My love equation'.

227
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,240
It is so mushy that it causes goosebumps.

228
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,570
But PD, I like this topic...

229
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,570
The response from audiences is very good and it
is necessary to have a suitable extent of mushiness

230
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,240
to gain popularity. Right, right?

231
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,070
Who told you the audience's reactions were good?

232
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,520
Submit to me a new proposal of the
program's activities before 11 tomorrow.

233
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,220
Tomorrow...

234
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,220
11 O'clock...

235
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,480
PD,

236
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,400
do you think this is the internet where you can
just press the computer keyboard and get what you want?

237
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,740
Think about how hard it is to plan a new proposal...

238
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
That is why there is a writer here isn't it?

239
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,280
But may I ask, why do you keep interrupting my lines?

240
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,450
For first meetings, you should at least
be polite and do a self-introduction

241
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,280
to be roughly familiar with one another.

242
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,950
Not create an atmosphere that
seems to be filled with adjustments.

243
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,280
Only then can you work together
properly isn't it? Right, right?

244
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Your eyes are really beautiful.

245
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,610
People often say that.

246
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,450
So, we'll end here.

247
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,780
I felt that you should like this kind of beverage...

248
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,610
Men with exquisite beauty should like expresso...

249
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:31,610
Oh, right...

250
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,610
When lying down,

251
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,990
first start from your head.

252
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,200
<i>Then slowly place your spine down one segment at a time.</i>

253
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,470
Straighten your waist,

254
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,330
<i>and assume a bent posture.</i>

255
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,990
Try pressing down,

256
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,160
<i>and maintain.</i>

257
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,820
How's PD Yun doing?

258
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,200
She is on a maternity leave.

259
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,570
Then who replaced the PD?

260
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,530
There is a new one.

261
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,240
Is it a man?

262
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,820
Yes it is. But he has completely
no proper upbringing! Annoying guy.

263
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,990
Stern city man?

264
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,820
Nope. City man who is always finding fault with others.

265
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,230
Talking about finding fault, that group Colpi Girls
or something...

266
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,490
is really asking for it.

267
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,740
Think about our past.

268
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,570
In the past we were idolized and powerful!

269
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,240
Exactly. Every weekend we will be able to hear...

270
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,950
Topping the chart this week is Purple!

271
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,320
Thank you!

272
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,150
Thanks to all the fans and friends of our fan club. I love you!

273
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,030
So, up next,

274
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,450
Purple's encore of "You're My Angel"...

275
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,860
~ <i>You are my angel, angel, angel to me.</i> ~

276
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,990
~ <i>Just like this, forever treasure and keep our love.</i> ~

277
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,900
~ <i>You are my angel.</i> ~

278
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,950
Thank you everyone, see you at the next performance!

279
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,650
I love you, I love you everyone.

280
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
Really miss those times...

281
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,950
Camera!

282
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,450
<i>Scene 423.</i>

283
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,110
Action!

284
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,030
Cut! Cut! Good! Enough! Don't film already!

285
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,800
Film the next title.

286
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,810
<i>Director, is it okay?</i>

287
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,540
- Okay!
- Hey, didn't I say okay already?

288
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,110
Miss Mi Ra, you've grasped the feeling well.

289
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,320
Cut! Cut! Okay! It's good! The feeling is good, you've grasped it well.

290
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,140
Film one more time.

291
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,820
Enough, enough, enough... There's not
enough time. Do you think you're filming a movie?

292
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,690
Okay!

293
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,650
You're really great, Representative Lee.

294
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,950
Director Jin, you must also know

295
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,820
that advertisements need to be smooth.

296
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Do you remember Ajinomoto? Seasoning.

297
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,320
How long do you think they took to shoot URUSA?
(URUSA - A type of liver medicine made from bear bile)

298
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,400
They took a half-moon bear from Jirisan
(Jirisan - A mountain in the southern part of South Korea)

299
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,610
and drained it for so many years.

300
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,070
The century hearing aid's advertisement
that was filmed over 10 years using one left ear,

301
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,280
has a huge advertisement in the Korean daily newspaper!

302
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
'Carrying a guitar' was also filmed for so many years!

303
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,940
Mi Ra is the same kind of long term worker.

304
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,860
Get ready.

305
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,400
Thanks to your company artist's good fortune,

306
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,740
life has been comfortable recently.

307
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,360
It is thanks to hyeongnim's good fortune instead.
Only if you're doing well then we'll have a good life.

308
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,700
Especially that 10 O'clock slot 'Idol'.

309
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,070
- Who was it that the program brought over? Pink Dolls?

310
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,070
- You're talking about Pink Dols?
- Yes, yes, yes...

311
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,150
The amount of listeners tuning in is really significant!

312
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,240
It's all because you chose well, hyeongnim.

313
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,450
The majority of listeners of the 10 O'clock
segment is still secondary school students,

314
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,570
so it is more suitable to rely mainly on idols.

315
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,320
6 O'clock is the time to get off work, hence arrangements
has to be made to consider the working population and taxi drivers.

316
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,740
That's why it is more suitable to
rely on those with higher reputation,

317
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,610
such as Yeun Mi Ra. What do you think?

318
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,650
Mi Ra?

319
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,450
Of course it's not a bad idea.

320
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,280
Not bad, right?

321
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,140
Not bad.

322
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,450
This proposal was painstakingly prepared by the writer and I...

323
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,110
So?

324
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,610
So?

325
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,610
What I'm trying to say is that using this kind of manner
to treat the author who has put in so much effort isn't too good...

326
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,990
For me, doing well is more important than working hard.

327
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,820
I believe that a good DJ should have three requirements.

328
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
Popularity, ability,

329
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,790
as well as personality.

330
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,280
Or at least possess two out of three.

331
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,530
No. Must at least have one, don't you think so?

332
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,320
What's the purpose of you telling me this now?

333
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,280
Don't always mix in too much personal
emotions when we are having a meeting,

334
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,230
you'll let people see through your character.

335
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,860
What is your target when it comes to the listener rating?

336
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,300
4%.

337
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,780
Just merely 4%?

338
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,990
The listenership hasn't exceeded 2% within the past half a year,

339
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,150
and you dare to say just merely 4%?

340
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,990
Is the past that important?

341
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,530
Dreams must be ambitious!

342
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,070
In that case, the proposal of the program's new topics...

343
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,720
should be done by Miss Sin Jin A.

344
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,530
Me?

345
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,700
I...what? I can do well...

346
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,860
I do...what? I'll do, I'll do it, I'll do it.

347
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,700
I, I can do well...

348
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,470
I will look forward to it.

349
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,240
Where did such a fellow come from?

350
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,070
<i>What should I do about this?</i>

351
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,900
<i>Should we wait for the next lift? </i>

352
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,240
Nevermind, just take this.

353
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,610
Hello.

354
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,630
It's been a while, Miss Jin A.

355
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,700
I've recently been watching your drama.

356
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,990
Is it?

357
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm really thankful for you saying such a thing.

358
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,780
But, sorry,

359
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,780
I haven't been able to listen to your radio broadcast.

360
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,030
Looks like you only have that little bit of ability.

361
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,240
Do well, Sin Jin A.

362
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,240
If you can only fare so badly after
abandoning Purple for your solo pursuits,

363
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,860
I will feel really bored.

364
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
I'll see you again.

365
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,450
Goodbye.

366
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,950
<i>Encore! Encore!</i>

367
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,940
<i>I don't suppose you intend to say that matter here, right?</i>

368
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,400
<i>Jin A,</i>

369
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,280
<i>don't.</i>

370
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,950
<i>Let's think about it again.</i>

371
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,380
<i>It isn't a must for that matter to be said today, isn't it?</i>

372
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,030
<i>I'd like to express my heartfelt thanks to
everyone who came to our concert today.</i>

373
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,930
<i>Today,</i>

374
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,530
<i>there is something I need to announce...</i>

375
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,950
<i>Today's performance will be our last.</i>

376
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,150
<i>From today onwards, our group Purple will be disbanded.</i>

377
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,130
<i>All these while...</i>

378
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,360
<i>thank you for loving us all this while.</i>

379
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,990
<i>Stretch out your other arm</i>

380
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,240
<i>parallel to your eye level.</i>

381
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,360
<i>Now, focus your vision to the direction
where your hand is pointing.</i>

382
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,450
For those who can accomplish that,
please bend your arm backwards

383
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,950
<i>and grab hold of your other hand.</i>

384
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,740
<i>Breathe in,</i>

385
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,780
<i>breathe out.</i>

386
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,280
<i>Inhale and feel the expansion of
your abdominal region and thoracic cavity.</i>

387
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,030
<i>Breath and relax your body muscles.</i>

388
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,450
<i>When doing yoga exercises, remember to
concentrate only on one's feelings.</i>

389
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,490
How did both of you get acquainted?

390
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,150
He's the PD I told you about.

391
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,490
Radio?

392
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,490
Oh, so it's that annoying guy?

393
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,170
Hey!

394
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
What about both of you?

395
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,280
Don't you know Purple's Ji In Yeong?

396
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,990
You don't recognize me?

397
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,820
Oh, the the flat-chested Ji In Yeong?

398
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,110
You've worked hard.

399
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,780
What did he say about me?

400
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,780
Why is he like that?

401
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,030
That's why I asked you to put some sponge pads...

402
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,700
Hey! How do you expect me to put
padding when I'm practising Yoga?

403
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,530
<i>I'm very glad to see all of you.</i>

404
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,700
Then, lets do well.

405
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,740
Bring them for a meal.

406
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,780
Yes, I understand.

407
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,160
See you next time.

408
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,910
Do they think that we are UNICEF?
(UNICEF - The United Nations Children's Fund)

409
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,410
Why do they bring this kind of people here?

410
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,910
So, what do you intend to do about it?

411
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,610
Wait a little longer, there will be a revision soon...

412
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,740
Are you sure?

413
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,160
Now all the popular DJ are our people, why do you still worry?

414
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,240
That's why what I meant was,

415
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,110
this time we have to do it for real.

416
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,450
I do not want to wait too long.

417
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,070
Hey! What I like most is to do it for real!

418
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,160
Hey, shall we go and eat?

419
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,530
<i>Oh...isn't this the newcomer PD Lee?</i>

420
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,090
- Hello everyone.
- It is said that you're now very popular.

421
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,100
What?

422
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,510
Are you talking about me going to the 9 O'clock program?

423
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,200
Not that. Aren't you now working with Jin A?

424
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,740
- Are you very familiar with Sin Jin A?
- Of course.

425
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,050
Before Purple was disbanded, they were
regular guests on our show for 2 months.

426
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,240
They were really awesome and their
songs were especially nice to listen to.

427
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,950
~ <i>You are my angel, angel...</i> ~

428
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,400
I bumped into her not long ago and she started
asking about you and what kind of person you were.

429
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,530
Then what did you say?

430
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,770
I said that you're as stingy as a beggar.

431
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,360
You really are like a beggar,

432
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,080
the DJs all hide and run when
they see you, only you do not know.

433
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,860
You have to treat her better,

434
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,110
there aren't many like her at this age.

435
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,520
She has loyalty and is sexy, pure and courteous.

436
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,990
You on the other hand really resembles a beggar.

437
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,990
How is your yoga practice coming along?

438
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm going crazy soon, my body is all stiff.

439
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,280
You will really learn how to be gentle,
you must learn more from me.

440
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,950
He is a faithful yoga fan.

441
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,280
Okay, I understand.

442
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,280
Namaste something...
(Namaste - A traditional Indian salutation)

443
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,950
Hyeongnim,

444
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,450
please don't drink alcohol and do the program anymore.

445
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,180
Hey!

446
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,110
What drink alcohol and do the program?
At most is do the program after drinking.

447
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,780
Exactly.

448
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,950
You can't say it like that,

449
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,280
it can be very fatal.

450
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,160
- At that time you really caused others to receive the blame.
- You have worked hard.

451
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,130
You make me really upset.

452
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,720
Do you want to go for a drink?

453
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,110
I'll call you tonight.

454
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,180
Okay. You've worked hard.

455
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,610
As the saying goes, a brief encounter is also fate.

456
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,450
Life is boundless,

457
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,610
please look around your surroundings.

458
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,660
For all of you to accompany me at this point of time,

459
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,820
means having such a large amount of fate with me.

460
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,320
Therefore, being able to hear my voice in the next 2 hours,

461
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,490
doesn't it mean that you and I have a very different kind of fate?

462
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,660
Wonderful Radio, this is Sin Jin A.

463
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,660
Today, our program's new PD Lee Jae Hyeok is right here.

464
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,320
He is one who only drinks ice americano and is a very cool guy.

465
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,660
PD Lee Jae Hyeok, fighting!

466
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,100
-=New program's proposal??=-

467
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,800
-=New program's proposal??=-
-=How dare you!!=-

468
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,910
-=New program's proposal??=-
-=How dare you!!=-
-=Broadcast this song as the first=-

469
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,990
So, let's listen to the first song of today.

470
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,660
Are you ready?

471
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,410
Sistar's...

472
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,530
"How Dare You".

473
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,000
-='Seldom is it not the skill of love, but the technique.'
Alphonse Daude -2065=-

474
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,110
<i>I always feel lethargic at this time.</i>

475
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,700
<i>I on the contrary, like this time the most,</i>

476
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,030
<i>as I can eat some light snacks.</i>

477
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,950
-=Change the music.=-
-="Like rain and like music."=-

478
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,200
=Our Wonderful Radio...=

479
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,030
The song for our 3rd segment of Wonderful Radio,

480
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,570
is a song that is very suitable for a rainy day like this.

481
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,200
- Gim Gwang Su's song "Like rain and like music".
- What? Gim Gwang Su?

482
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,350
Whose song did you say this was?

483
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,280
Oh, is it Kim Hyeon Shik's?

484
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,320
I'll correct it when the broadcast is over.

485
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,910
You think that a simple correction is enough?

486
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:54,740
No, that wasn't what I meant...but this kind of mistake
is hard to avoid, and I originally have problems
differentiating between Gim Gwang Su and Gim Hyeon Shik --

487
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,910
How can you possibly not be able to differentiate
between Gim Gwang Su and Gim Hyeon Shik?

488
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,740
Hey, hey! What are you doing
when broadcast is still ongoing?

489
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,730
Let me go!

490
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,910
Hey! How can you be regarded as a singer?

491
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,070
Let's talk outside.

492
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,740
Did you guys see that?

493
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,920
He even slammed the table. Looks like the rumor
about you having a dog attitude is true. Dog, dog!

494
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,040
Nuna, I will...

495
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,070
Outside shouldn't be able to hear right?

496
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,360
You are a dog! Dog! Dog!

497
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,950
I'm feeling really giddy.

498
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,990
You better be careful in the future!

499
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,370
Quickly, drink some water.

500
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,950
<i>So, the rumors are true...</i>

501
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,970
Miss! Do you have time?

502
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,030
I have time, but not energy.

503
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,990
Are you still angry?

504
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:56,070
What's wrong with that guy? He's like a crazy viper,
he must really have something wrong with his brain...

505
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,450
But, do you know?

506
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,660
If you were to say and scold bad things about
the music I liked when I was 20 years old...

507
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,410
I will feel as if I have been stripped of my youth.

508
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:10,990
I also didn't scold, just merely said
the wrong name accidentally...

509
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,780
For example, if someone were
to miscall Purple as Fin.K.L,

510
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,570
I will definitely go crazy, really!

511
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,070
Oh, right,

512
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,360
this is Lee Jae Hyeok's youth.

513
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,450
Listen to it on your way back.

514
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,320
~ <i>Further and further away...</i> ~

515

Today is the last day. The new corner!=-

524
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,670
Did you catch a cold?

525
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,890
Mom, should I resign from
my job at the radio station?

526
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,530
Suit yourself.

527
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,670
You either sing at a nightclub,
or follow him your entire life.

528
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,200
Mom, how can you say such
things to your own daughter?

529
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,860
I am Purple's Sin Jin A! I am
also still alive and can still sing!

530
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,350
Did you swallow a train engine?

531
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,390
Ever since the day you became a DJ,
you haven't stopped complaining...

532
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,840
~ <i>How long more...</i> ~

533
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:26,750

538
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,770
eomma, I found it, I found it.

539
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,820
Oh yeah!

540
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,110
Crazy girl.

541
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,280
Look for people with stories to tell,

542
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,510
prepare for that to go on air next week.

543
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,030
See! I told you that you wrote it well.

544
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,910
Back in secondary school, I was
a writing champion, champion.

545
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,130
Fighting!

546
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,430
=Our Wonderful Radio...=

547
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:48,360
Wonderful Radio has a new segment to offer you,

548
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,780
'Songs that are sung for you'.

549
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,860
The first protagonist of today's new
segment is a 22 years old military man,

550
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,030
who used his precious
vacation to attend our program.

551
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,530
So, shall we listen to his story together?

552
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,530
I am Chong Kwang Tae, the Chief
of the military service in Pyeongchang.

553
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:13,360
It's not because of anything else but I...
have someone I really like.

554
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,910
However, she doesn't want to
accept me. I'm going crazy soon.

555
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:23,380
Last year I even ran away
from the army because of her,

556
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,850
<i>and was arrested by the police and nearly hanged...</i>

557
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,580
That shouldn't be so serious...

558
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,780
so, let us listen to his song together?

559
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,650
With my sincerity, I present to you a
song by Brown Eyed Soul's Jong Yeop called

560
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,460
- Nothing B!
- Er...

561
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,260
then shall we listen to "Nothing Better" together?

562
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,750
Hey!

563
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,110
Im Sul Ki from the department of English,

564
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,160
don't belittle me, I will surely be
as good or be better than you.
You just need to wait there honestly--

565
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,570
Please calm down, let us listen to "Nothing Better".

566
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,910
Angel Sul Ki, Im Sul Ki! Im Sul Ki!

567
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,780
~ <i>Just like breathing, you
always remain by my side...</i> ~

568
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,030
Soo Ki, are you okay?

569
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,300
Hey! If it's you, will you be okay?

570
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,090
From tomorrow onwards, you
must start growing angel wings.

571
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,070
~ <i>Remain here just like this without leaving...</i> ~

572
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:38,470
~ <i>Nothing better, nothing better, than you...</i> ~

573
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,180
This is really! I can't take it!

574
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,110
Chong Kwang Tae, you're dead!

575
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,360
Ajussi! Can you please turn the radio off?
(Ajussi - Uncle)

576
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,160
We received a call saying that they want
to sue us for fabricating a broadcasted story,

577
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:06,160
and also accused us for being able to
do anything to raise the listenership.

578
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,570
Bujangnim, this program's item is much better than
expected, if only you can give us a bit more time...
(Bujangnim - General Manager)

579
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:15,940
Of course it's good to raise the
listenership, so maybe we'll maintain the
current situation until the time for revision.

580
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,360
Or we might as well change the DJ and program
segment all at once. What do you think?

581
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,200
What?

582
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,530
Have a good thought about it.

583
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,710
Why are you here?

584
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,340
Did you get reprimanded by the higher ups?

585
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,310
Then did you think I'll get praised?

586
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,270
I'm sorry.

587
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,810
Why? Why are you sorry?

588
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,450
No, it's because of me that's why...

589
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,410
I was the one who chose the proposal for the new item.

590
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,740
It's a PD's job to choose and be responsible
for the program's segment. This time is no difference.

591
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,240
You don't need to worry. I'll be
responsible for our team till the end.

592
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,290
Try and see.

593
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,950
Hey, Cha Dae Geun! Can't you see
the car is going to explode soon?

594
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,700
Can't you, can't you just inspect it beforehand?

595
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,860
Can you be responsible for our late arrival?
Heavens, what time is it already?

596
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,350
I'm sorry.

597
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,990
Quickly get a taxi.

598
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,040
Really too much!

599
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,670
Really too much! How can you get a taxi here?

600
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,560
Ah!

601
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,910
Help! Help!

602
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,360
I listen to your broadcast often.

603
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,990
Ah, thank you.

604
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,780
Wow, your child is so cute and
your wife is also very beautiful.

605
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,740
That photo was taken really well.

606
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,280
May I ask, can I participate on one of your broadcast?

607
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,400
PD, this is the original manuscript.

608
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,140
She actually anyhow changed
the program. Where's Jin A?

609
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,280
She's here.

Wonderful Radio, 'Songs that are sung for you'.

612
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,770
Today's hero is a 42 years old
taxi driver, Mr. Kim Ji Hyeong.

613
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,890
So, would you please tell us your story personally?

614
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,590
Hello.

615
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,140
I wonder what story will there be today?

616
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,620
- Keep quiet.
- My name is Kim Ji Young.

617
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:35,070
There is a letter that I was
unable to send to my wife in time.

618
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,910
That is why I am here today.

619
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,910
Yun Yeong, this is Ji Hyeong.

620
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:58,740
It's been three years since you left us.

621
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,240
I would first like to say that I'm sorry.

622
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,850
I'm sorry for letting you experience so much hardships.

623
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:12,690
When you were alive, I didn't even write you one
letter. I'm sorry that I wasn't a considerate husband.

624
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,320
Oh right, I've prepared the song that you really liked.

625
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,360
You used to laugh at me for not being able to sing well.

626
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,770
Then listen, I'll start singing.

627
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,470
Yun Yeong,

628
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,350
Yun Yeong, our Min So...

629
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,100
The doctor said she has cancer like you.

630
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,490
I know you really miss Min So right?

631
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,990
I know, I know but I cannot give Min So to you.

632
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:10,070
I must let Min So recover,

633
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,820
to grow up and get married, and to give
birth to a grandchild who will look like you.

634
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:21,240
So, no matter how much you miss her,
you must leave her by my side till that happens.

635
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,570
I'm sorry, I'll be counting on you.

636
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,530

Hey, hey, hey. Tae Young, why did you greet him?

Forget it.

Ajussi. Please don't greet
my friend next time.

00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,610
It's only a trifle matter, there
shouldn't be a need to congratulate...

683
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,660
You know how to compose too?

684
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:41,410
Of course. I am a woman with copyrights.

685
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,500
That is really unexpected.

686
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,310
What is?

687
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,110
Aren't you of idol origins?

688
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:51,830
What is it with being an idol? Can't idols compose?

689
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:57,070
Nuna, why are you still here?
That guy, PD Lee is currently...

690
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,660
Hello, PD.

691
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,390
I'll go back to the car first.
Have a nice day.

692
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:14,220
He really didn't even miss a week.
What do you think this person does?

693
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,440
A florist?

694
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:19,700
Who cares what he does? As long as its
for certain that he will be someone very fragrant.

695
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,060
Look at how contented you are...

696
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:30,860
Hello. PD, this is the information
and story for today's lead person.

697
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,030
Must let Sin Jin A read this before the program begins.

698
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,910
That was chosen by eonni.

699
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,700
- Hello everybody.
- Hello.

700
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,560
Eonni, this is for you.

701
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,360
What is there for us to listen to?

702
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,910
Why? What is it?

703
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:13,950
Da Hui sent a text message to
ask us to listen to the radio.

704
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,630
Radio?

705
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,240
='Songs that are sung for you'=

706
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:26,740
Today, we welcome a very cute
secondary student to our studio.

707
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,680
Hello.

708
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:35,240
Hello. I am Yun Da Hui,
a 10th grade student.

709
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,470
Then, can you introduce to us your story and song?

710
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,040
Dad, can you hear me?

711
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,520
I'm on the radio station
that you used to love.

712
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:54,900
Dad, you know right?
Mom got remarried.

713
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,590
=<i>That ajussi is uglier than you.</i>=

714
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:05,520
But, he treats Mom very well.

715
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:14,570
After you passed away,
it was such a difficult time for Mom and me.

716
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:24,570
That ugly ajussi, that annoying ajussi...

717
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:31,450
He said that he is very happy to have a daughter like me.

718
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:41,130
As long as you allow it,

719
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,250
I'd like to accept that ajussi now.

720
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,340
I'm really sorry for this period of time.

721
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,290
Thank you for the gift.

722
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,320
Dad.

723
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:26,540
~ <i>I hope you can understand that
I can't be close to your heart.</i> ~

724
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:41,360
~ <i>Tears tell me my earnest hope.</i> ~

725
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,570
~ <i>I once loved, and once complained,</i> ~

726
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,260
~ <i>missing that someone</i> ~

727
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,740
~ <i>who used to love me more than anyone else.</i> ~

728
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:07,280
~ <i>Always by my side but have
never been able to get near.</i> ~

729
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:13,830
~ <i>Yes, I will complain...</i> ~

730
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:19,940
~ <i>Please listen to what I have to say,</i> ~

731
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:26,780
~ <i>I only require some time.</i> ~

732
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:36,360
~ <i>I once loved, and once complained,</i> ~

733
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,990
~ <i>missing that someone</i> ~

734
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:43,340
~ <i>who used to love me more than anyone else.</i> ~

735
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:52,700
~ <i>Hidden deep in my heart,</i> ~

736
00:53:53,110 --> 00:54:04,410
~ <i>yes, I once loved...</i> ~

737
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:19,070
The stories you chose were not bad.

738
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,030
That was nothing hard.

739
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,490
I thought of a question during recording.

740
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:32,290
What is Wonderful Radio to you?

741
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:41,230
A time when I can talk about my stories. I mean in the past,

742
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:43,660
but not anymore.

743
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:50,880
Listen to other people's stories,
to feel touched and to comfort them.

744
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:55,110
And I myself can find comfort through that.

745
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,950
I have learnt a lot.

746
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,800
I really feel like singing.

747
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:12,820
Only now then I really understand what I
should say through the help of music.

748
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,670
Nuna! Nuna! What should I do?

749
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,570
It's hot!

750
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:24,810
Nuna and PD, it's really not a joke.
It's totally hot and all over youtube and reports!

751
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:31,740
<i>Yes, reporter, interview is it? Sure, no problem.</i>

752
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,720
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

753
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,570
<i>Since when did you start seeing it?</i>

754
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,600
<i>Three days ago.</i>

755
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,530
<i>Three days?</i>

756
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,410
Wow, that is quite long...

757
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:41,260
This time it's really long enough.

758
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:42,340
Not bad.

759
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:13,910
~ <i>You are my angel, angel, angel to me. </i> ~

760
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:19,740
~ <i>Just like this, forever treasure and keep our love.</i> ~

761
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:27,530
~ <i>Today, you are as wonderful as yesterday,</i> ~

762
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,950
~ <i>not leaving behind even the smallest regret...</i> ~

763
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,940
Today's Wonderful Radio will
soon say goodbye to everyone.

764
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,030
The cool and refreshing wind
makes such a fine night.

765
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:41,950
Doesn't pork bone soup with soju
sound perfect for this kind of night?
(Soju - Native Korean distilled alcohol)

766
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,900
Wow. That's simply great.

767
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,030
There is one song that I'll like
to recommend, "Night's Starlight",

768
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,970
a song by Lee Seung Hwan.

769
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,080
-=It's Kim Hyun Shik's song.=-

770
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,150
Lee Seung Hwan's peculiar timbre gives us
a different feeling from the original song.

771
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,410
Do we have Lee Sung Hwan's version?

772
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:09,320
Would you please enjoy this song while
I bid my goodbye to everyone here.

773
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,530
I wish everyone will have a fine night.

774
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:18,280
~ <i>The night is just like your breathing,</i> ~

775
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:25,450
~ <i>that quietly wipes away my tears.</i> ~

776
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,330
~ <i>Starlight...</i> ~

777
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,710
I heard that Wonderful Radio
is very popular, hyeongnim.

778
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,780
PD Lee has gotten himself into something big.

779
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,280
Congratulations hyeongnim. This is really...

780
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,220
If it's like this, what about me?

781
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,860
Why are you like an amateur? You can't
always pull down people who are doing well.

782
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,280
But hyeongnim, listen to me,

783
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,050
I will be so regretful.

784
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:07,110
But, this kind of regret can be changed anytime.

785
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,490
Representative Lee, are you
still not familiar with this line?

786
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:16,090
If you pull Sin Jin A down now,
you'll only create nonsensical rumors.

787
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:25,600
~ <i>It obviously wasn't me who sent you away,</i> ~

788
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:30,450
~ <i>and it obviously wasn't me who left.</i> ~

789
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,490
PD, who do you like more?
Gim Yeon Shik or Gim Gwang Su?

790
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:37,660
Gim Gwang Su.

791
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:43,740
Then you must list Gim Gwang Su's
song names while I do the same for
Gim Yeon Shik. How about that?

792
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,070
You still want to say when you can't even
differentiate who sang "Like rain and like music".

793
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,130
Loser must grant a wish.

794
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,570
Good, good.

795
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:54,610
Right, "Like rain and like music"!

796
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,850
No, I'm not playing, I'm not playing...

797
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,450
10...9...8...

798
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,860
"Although I loved you", "Although I loved you"...

799
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,230
"The four seasons".

800
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,650
"When I was 30 years old".

801
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,170
"Watercolor painting of a rainy day".

802
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,730
Eh...that is not.

803
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:08,530
It was sung with Kang In Ran and Kong In Ha.

804
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:09,620
<i>Really good. </i>

805
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:13,530
Okay, okay. "The story of an old couple".

806
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:19,570
Wrong! The correct name should be
"The story of a 60 years old couple".

807
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,600
That's right, that's right.

808
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:26,950
Grant a wish! Grant a wish! Grant a wish!

809
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,530
Wait! Wait...

810
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:32,620
I'll change it, I'll change it.
Kim Yeon Shik's "The terminal of goodbye".

811
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,530
Bleh...you have obviously lost.

812
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,280
Is this a shop you come to often?

813
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,280
Considered so. I come here everyday.

814
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,820
This wine is very beneficial towards the body.

815
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:50,370
Today's pork bone soup is amazing.

816
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:54,490
Are you implying that yesterday's
pork bone soup wasn't any good?

817
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:01,190
But, PD, you're really handsome.

818
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:03,970
Do you know me?

819
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,980
Of course, the annoying guy.

820
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,390
Don't be like this, Madam Lee...

821
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,350
Wasn't it what you said?

822
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,930
The annoying city man.

823
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,050
Shall I introduce the both of you?

824
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,540
<i>This is PD Lee,</i>

825
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,990
and this is my mother.

826
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,050
I have always loved listening
to your radio broadcasts.

827
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,740
Although Jin A may be a little ignorant and loves
to throw tantrums, but she is actually a good kid.

828
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,620
If she doesn't listen, I'll
count on you to discipline her.

829
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:40,370
Since when did i throw tantrums? When did I?

830
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,490
You keep quiet.

831
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,710
And also, Mr. PD,

832
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,870
It's only out of concern that's why I'm saying more.

833
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,850
- I hope you do not misunderstand.
- Yes.

834
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:52,070
In principle, I am more against office romance.

835
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,880
I'm a bit sorry and afraid that you may
laugh at me for flaunting my daughter.

836
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,720
- But there is nothing I can do
because being pretty is also a kind of sin.
- Mom!

837
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,580
What are you shouting for? You frightened
me that I would have nearly dropped a child.

838
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,500
Oh my, what did I just say?

839
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,610
Be careful, be careful.

840
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,620
You must send her home safely!

841
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:19,690
Aigoo, aigoo. It must be really exhausting.

842
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,050
That looks really heavy.

843
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,480
<i>My head!</i>

844
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:28,860
It's a bit unexpected.

845
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,610
What's unexpected?

846
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:34,750
Nothing, its just...

847
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:38,400
I didn't expect you to know how
to take of others. Isn't it unexpected?

848
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,750
Of course I can take care of people!

849
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,160
I want to go home! Go Home!

850
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,990
I've to faster get home!

851
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,330
Be careful!

852
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,310
Just find a place to sit.

853
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:03,800
Right, just now I won the game but I haven't told you my wish.

854
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,400
Tell me your wish then.

855
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,270
Give me a pleasant surprise on my birthday?

856
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:11,460
When is your birthday?

857
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,980
It will tell you.

858
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:26,760
That program of yours is really good.

859
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,200
Honestly speaking,

860
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:33,010
it was my mom who gave me the idea.

861
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,690
When I was younger, the boat my dad was on

862
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:40,280
went missing at the ocean near Russia.

863
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,570
But, my mom said she likes that word a lot,

864
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,810
missing.

865
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,580
He's not dead, but missing.

866
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:55,280
Which is why my mom adorns herself everyday,

867
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,500
and not move house.

868
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:02,630
My dad also loves the way my mom sings,

869
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:05,620
so she would always be humming a song.

870
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,380
That was where I got my idea from.

871
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:26,140
This is the first and last gift my dad gave me.

872
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,250
Can you guess what I wrote with it?

873
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:31,040
What?

874
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:33,580
"You're My Angel".

875
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,220
My first song.

876
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,610
That song is really nice to listen to.

877
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:40,950
This is surprising, you actually praised me.

878
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,020
Jin A, your song

879
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,390
has a story behind it.

880
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:47,790
Of course!

881
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,460
I'm a woman with a story to tell.

882
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,240
You haven't been composing recently?

883
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,400
Not much inspiration.

884
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,760
It's like I lost something from here.

885
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,020
Here, one shot.

886
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,060
Why did you give me so much?

887
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,730
One shot!

888
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:18,340
Oh my, it's really spicy.

889
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,100
Do you want another cup?

890
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,550
Lee Jae Hyeok, where are you going?

891
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:27,530
Walk properly, did you hear me?

892
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:29,090
I'm not going anywhere.

893
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,280
1, 2, 4. 4th one.

894
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:35,810
2, 4, 3, 4.

895
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,600
That's too funny.

896
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,810
Hey, I drank with a celebrity.

897
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,920
Wait, how did we get here?

898
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,170
Which way?

899
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,120
Please give me a bottle of soju!

900
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,390
I found it, go in that direction.

901
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:55,230
Over there. Hey, celebrity, let's go.

902
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,780
Let's go together...

903
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,110
Get up!

904
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:21,060
Where are we?

905
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,000
Mo...motel.

906
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,840
You jerk!

907
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,190
No wonder I felt it was strange,

908
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,240
last night you kept making me drink!

909
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,560
- Calm down a bit.
- What, what, what are you doing?

910
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,090
- Where are you trying to climb? You really...

911
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,500
Wait, wait.

912
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:44,740
You drank so much yesterday
until you weren't acting like a person.

913
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,440
What? What did you say?

914
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,110
If I'm not a person then what am I?

915
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,990
Don't tell me Dae Geun and I...

916
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:52,010
- did some inhuman things here?
- No, no, no!

917
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:53,950
Things weren't like that.

918
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,260
You probably don't remember,

919
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,400
but when I was driving, you asked me to

920
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,490
spit and stuff like that.

921
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:03,310
You even scolded me a bastard and
said that you didn't want to go home.

922
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:06,160
Then you suddenly said you wanted to undress...

923
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:09,180
Bastard, there's no way
I could have acted like that!

924
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,780
Why must you lie?

925
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,970
It's the truth!

926
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,360
Omo, omo!

927
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,750
You see, see, see...

928
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:19,950
Panty, panty...

929
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,330
Where's your pants?

930
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:22,980
I asked you where did your pants go?

931
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,070
Annoying.

932
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,650
Yesterday you vomited 4 times
in the middle of the night!

933
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,700
That is why I turned from side to side
without being able to sleep.

934
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,890
It's so early in the morning,
where did I get this bad luck from...

935
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:33,540
and you even hit me...

936
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,710
Sometimes, whatever expressions are
also unable to make you pleased.

937
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:39,460
When you feel you're unable to
withstand the pressures of life,

938
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:44,400
Wonderful Radio hopes to be able to
become your family, friend or lover.

939
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:50,820
~ <i>eomma, don't give up! I will
accompany you by your side...</i> ~

940

~ <i>Honey, I love you.</i> ~

941
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:29,820
Congratulations Miss Sin Jin A!
You are extremely popular!

942
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,200
When are you going to release a new album?

943
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,050
Actually, there are a few songs that aren't too bad...

944
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,450
So, we'll be able to hear your songs once again?

945
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,370
I would also really like to meet my fans again...

946
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,200
-='Only when you're in love then
can you understand true love.' -2065=-

947
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,360
Please don't tell anyone else.

948
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,360
Mr. Dae Geun!

949
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:57,910
Looks like we are really a match made in heaven.

950
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,530
'Songs that are sung for you'.

951
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:06,900
Today, we have invited our 13th guest,

952
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:09,310
29 years old Miss Ru Mi.

953
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,070
She labels herself as a white swan
who becomes a musician for her dream.

954
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,160
So, shall we listen to her story?

955
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,620
Today I would like to dedicate a song to someone

956
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,840
who is none other than DJ Miss Sin Jin A.

957
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,410
Me?

958
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,320
It's really an honor,

959
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,920
thank you.

960
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,180
For more words that I want to say,

961
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,070
I'll like to use my singing to replace it.

962
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,900
Then, let's listen to it together?

963
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:44,990
~ <i>Why is it that time passes
more slowly when I'm sad?</i> ~

964
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:53,120
~ <i>Why is it that time takes so long to pass by?</i> ~

965
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:59,120
~ <i>Am I overcoming it or slowly getting used to it?</i> ~

966
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:03,240
~ <i>All the pacing back and forth with indecisiveness,</i> ~

967
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:07,120
~ <i>where exactly is the endpoint?</i> ~

968
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,000
PD,

969
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,870
there is someone who keeps
uploading the same video online.

970
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,960
~ <i>Please let me gradually</i> ~

971
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:22,960
~ <i>become stronger.</i> ~

972
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,870
No, no...it's not like that.

973
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:35,870
~ <i>Everything will change.</i> ~

974
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,870
Miss Sin Jin A,

975
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,530
<i>isn't this melody very familiar?</i>

976
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,160
<i>It was my first publication at
a club in Hongdae in 2002.</i>

977
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:47,660
<i>It is called "Island".</i>

978
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:50,990
In 2004, I received an invitation
to release an album, but it failed.

979
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:55,160
The then ultimate female group, Purple,

980
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,900
<i>actually plagiarized my melody.</i>

981
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,030
Miss Ru Mi,

982
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:03,410
that melody was composed by me.

983
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,760
That's right, it was composed by me...

984
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,700
<i>Seems like you made a mistake.</i>

985
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,660
-=Don't act impulsively,
quickly end the conversation.=-

986
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,700
<i>Don't you know you're wrong?</i>
-= Don't act impulsively,
quickly end the conversation. =-

987
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,340
<i>Don't you know you're wrong?</i>

988
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,160
<i>I just...</i>

989
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,700
-= Hurry! =-
<i>My reason for coming here
is to find my stolen melody.</i>

990
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:15,820
<i>My reason for coming here is to find my stolen melody.</i>

991
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,530
The melody you stole!

992
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,620
My first song...

993
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,950
Are you able to take responsibility
for what you said just now?

994
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:31,820
How are you going to prove
you composed that melody?

995
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,780
<i>I have the performance video of last time,</i>

996
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:36,570
and the song which I just performed myself.

997
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:40,070
Do you need anymore?

998
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,070
<i>"You're My Angel"?</i>

999
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,030
<i>Purple?</i>

1000
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,780
What a joke...

1001
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:51,660
- Hey! You liar!
- Quickly turn off the microphone.

1002
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:53,280
What are you talking about now?

1003
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,700
This is a live broadcast, what
do you think you're doing?

1004
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,290
<i>Nuna, calm down!</i>

1005
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:13,290
Miss Jin A,

1006
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,410
what exactly happened?

1007
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,450
You actually shouted and
scolded during a live broadcast,

1008
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,240
at least give me an explanation.

1009
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:20,950
So you expected me to
remain calm and composed?

1010
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,780
She said I plagiarized her work!

1011
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,200
The internet and mail inbox

1012
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:27,370
has the video of her past
performance circulating around.

1013
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,850
What exactly is the truth?

1014
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:34,950
You too...

1015
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:39,530
PD, you also...

1016
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:43,320
do not believe me.

1017
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:45,450
I'm leaving.

1018
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,820
Miss Jin A!

1019
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,320
Don't you even know that under that
kind of circumstances, you should have
turned off the microphone and play music?

1020
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,280
<i>Do you know the extent of the damage done?</i>

1021
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,450
What will happen to Sin Jin A?

1022
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,370
Do you really not know?

1023
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:03,320
From tomorrow onwards, ban her
from the program! Do you understand?

1024
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,320
Shouldn't you at least
give her a chance to explain?

1025
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,320
Explain what?

1026
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,550
Plagiarism?

1027
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,410
Whether or not she plagiarized,

1028
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:12,280
since she caused this kind of trouble,
she should have some conscience!

1029
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,780
<i>That's why I said that it is a
must to switch Jin A off the program.</i>

1030
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,450
I've mentioned before,

1031
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,890
if it is Mi Ra,

1032
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:21,560
where would there be such a scenario?

1033
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,450
I understand.

1034
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,890
That is why,

1035
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,930
is it possible to let Mi Ra join that program?

1036
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,330
Hyeongnim, how is that feasible?

1037
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,700
Like this she will become Jin A's live scapegoat...

1038
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:37,030
That is simply unreasonable.

1039
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:41,370
That's why I'm begging you.

1040
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:50,200
I understand. Since it's hyeongnim's
request, I will consider it carefully.

1041
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:55,370
- Thank you!
- I don't even know when I'll be
able to enjoy your good fortune.

1042
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,460
How should I hit this ball?

1043
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,530
Oh, In Yeong...

1044
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:25,250
=Hey! Are you okay?=

1045
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:28,210
=At home?=

1046
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,290
=Want me to go over and find you?=

1047
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,200
=You're alone at home, right?=

1048
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,700
=I better come over.=

1049
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,990
I'm fine.

1050
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:38,950
Hey! Why are you worried?

1051
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:45,660
=Hey! You're afraid I'll be worried that's why
you are holding it back and not saying, right?=

1052
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:48,240
=I'm really fine with that.=

1053
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:50,450
=No matter what the world says about my past,=

1054
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,070
=I am already fine with that.=

1055
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,820
=So, don't hold it in like this,=

1056
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:57,570
=voice out what you feel like saying.
Think more about yourself.=

1057
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:58,740
=Okay?=

1058
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,490
Okay, enough. Hang up.

1059
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:01,990
=Jin A...=

1060
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:03,780
=Sin Jin A!=

1061
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,700
Time really flies.

1062
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:17,200
I've known everyone for already a month.

1063
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,490
For me, the audiences are
already like close relatives.

1064
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,200
What about everyone?

1065
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,700
I'll dedicate my favorite song,

1066
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,700
a song by Lee Sin Cheol.

1067
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:29,410
"Super Hero".

1068
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:34,870
How was it?

1069
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,450
Just now that was Lee Seung Hwan's song.
You can correct it when the song is over.

1070
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,620
Was that how I said it?

1071
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,620
I'm really sorry, I will correct it.

1072
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,280
PD, when the program ends,

1073
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,450
do you want to go and eat sashimi?

1074
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,280
I'll treat.

1075
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:54,950
Maybe next time.

1076
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,450
Next time is a must!

1077
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,280
Are there any recent news about Sin Jin A?

1078
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:02,620
<i>Seems like there is no news regarding her.</i>

1079
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:07,060
<i>Don't know whether she can make a
comeback, I think it is hopeless for her.</i>

1080
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:15,780
Your Wonderful Radio...

1081
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,990
did you not know that it nearly died prematurely?

1082
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:20,530
<i>It was proceeding fine,</i>

1083
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:24,950
but the General Manager said that all
the program's personnel, including the PD,
Script Writer and DJ will be changed.

1084
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:27,950
Do you know how Miss Jin A
reacted after finding out?

1085
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:29,620
<i>She actually rushed into the
General Manager's office immediately!</i>

1086
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:33,780
She asked whether did he actually
consider about the hardworking personnel
working behind the scenes?

1087
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,660
<i>The General Manager must
have been furious at that time.</i>

1088
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,240
What's the use?

1089
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:44,620
She can't even take care of herself...

1090
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,700
Excuse me,

1091
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:21,410
is the Director still in a meeting?

1092
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,870
I've made an appointment to see him at 2 pm.

1093
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,410
Please wait for a moment.

1094
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,910
Director, Miss Sin Jin A is still...

1095
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:36,450
<i>Yes, I understand...</i>

1096
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:42,450
~ <i>I did not know that the past memories</i> ~

1097
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:45,910
- ~ <i>would be like this...</i> ~
- Stop, stop.

1098
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:50,120
Sounds like it's lacking feeling.

1099
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,660
I assure you, I'll be like a
singer who has just debuted,

1100
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:57,160
one who seriously composes and sings.

1101
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,990
- Director, please give me an opportunity, I will...
- <i>Jin A!</i>

1102
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:02,030
The present Sin Jin A

1103
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:04,620
is not comparable with the idol star of before.

1104
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,200
<i>The feeling is completely different.</i>

1105
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,930
I do not wish to say any further.

1106
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,890
Ah, yes, that song just now...

1107
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:18,530
was composed by you, right?

1108
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:25,280
<i>Now Infinite is the most popular.</i>

1109
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,490
No they are not, Beast is the most popular!

1110
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:31,780
- Isn't that Sin Jin A?
- Sin Jin A...

1111
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:34,450
That's the person who
plagiarized other people's work.

1112
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:37,780
<i>Hey! It's not the first time
you've came across such people.</i>

1113
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:41,280
She used to think so highly of herself,

1114
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,450
look at what she has become now.

1115
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,450
<i>That's why I say those who are artists</i>

1116
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:48,950
<i>are different compared to
the person they were before.</i>

1117
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:52,450
Hey, have you heard her attitude
and manner in the past broadcasts?

1118
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:55,370
It is completely disgusting, disgusting.

1119
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,030
Hey, let's go, let's go.

1120
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,370
She's still holding a guitar, does
she really think she is a singer?

1121
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:05,410
- Stop saying, what if she scolds us?
- Hey, hurry up!

1122
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:21,660
Looks like there is no performance today.

1123
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:24,570
Yes, there isn't.

1124
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,070
Recently business also hasn't been too good,

1125
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:29,870
I can't pay them to perform.

1126
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,780
Which is why I play music to pass time.

1127
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:35,910
- Are you by any chance a musician?
- Nope.

1128
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:39,910
I suddenly recalled a friend who
performed here 10 years ago.

1129
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:45,830
That's impossible! We've only been open
for 4 years now. It used to be a PC Bang.
(PC Bang - PC Room)

1130
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,810
What did you say?

1131
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:48,850
See for yourself if you don't believe.

1132
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,950
I want to switch the beauty salon, I don't like this one.

1133
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,700
You didn't even patronize that place for long.

1134
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,160
They always make me wait very long.

1135
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,030
Just tell them about it yourself, silly...

1136
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:09,160
Oh oppa, it's making me anxious.

1137
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:13,370
- People always ask me when my new album is coming out.
- Oh, new album?

1138
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:17,280
I have already spoken with the fatty, Shin Sa Dong,

1139
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,370
to let him create a song based on your style and name.

1140
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:22,030
- Really?
- Of course.

1141
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,370
<i>Move aside!</i>

1142
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:27,700
- There's still a meeting going on.
- You're playing really happily...

1143
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,870
You startled me.

1144
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:34,240
- PD Lee, what is this about?
- Miss Ru Mi,

1145
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,740
- ten years ago is it?
- Yes?

1146
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:42,410
You said you performed "Island" in 2002 is that so?

1147
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:45,070
Yes! But why do you suddenly ask this?

1148
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:48,740
A club that opened only in 2007,

1149
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:51,410
yet you could perform there in 2002?

1150
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,780
PD Lee, what exactly are you trying to do?

1151
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:57,700
You suddenly rushed into other people's office.
Do you have any manners?

1152
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,410
Representative Lee,

1153
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:02,070
how could you do something like that?

1154
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:05,950
Just because of a scumbag like you,

1155
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:09,120
an innocent person who wanted to use
sincerity to host the radio program was wasted!

1156
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,010
Scumbag?

1157
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:13,910
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Call Sin Jin A back.

1158
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:20,410
<i>Hey, PD Lee! PD Lee!</i>

1159
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,570
<i>- Faster sleep.
- Hyeong, you really don't understand my heart.</i>

1160
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,450
- Why is it whatever I say you still...
- Sleep!

1161
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:34,620
I'm sorry for frightening you, Mr. driver.

1162
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,370
It's all right, it's all right. I can
see that he isn't in a very good mood.

1163
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:42,780
- I'll play a cheerful and lighthearted
song for you guys to hear.
- Sure, that's fine.

1164
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:53,620
Oh, this song used to be famous, who sang it?

1165
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:56,030
- Should I give you a hint?
- Okay.

1166
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:57,740
A very famous group.

1167
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,160
The predecessor of idol groups as well as
the beginning of idols and then the end.

1168
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:05,780
- Purple...
- Purple!

1169
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:10,120
- Purple, Purple...correct, Purple! I know them.
- So you still remember...

1170
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:14,570
I still remember their dance.
This, this and this, right?

1171
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:17,780
- I also know.
- Sleep!

1172
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,490
This is how you dance it, isn't it?

1173
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:23,910
Taking advantage of the good atmosphere,
let me bring you to a fun place.

1174
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:27,910
- You can look forward to it.
- Just drive.

1175
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:58,490
- Mom.
- Why did you come in?

1176
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,990
I came by to see whether there
is anything I can help you with.

1177
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:05,990
This is so unlikely, I'm so touched.

1178
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:08,160
If there's nothing, fine.

1179
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,160
How is the matter about plagiarism coming along?

1180
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:17,660
Not very good. Mom, how about we...

1181
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,660
drink some alcohol?

1182
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:24,160
Are you crazy? But how come
it's so much to my intention?

1183
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,820
Cheers!

1184
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:38,660
Eat some side dishes, or else
you will harm your stomach.

1185
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:42,370
- No...
- You learnt your dad's bad habits.

1186
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:45,700
I've got a question for you.

1187
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,870
Why is there no news about PD Lee?

1188
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:52,530
How did you know? We even quarreled...

1189
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:56,700
It doesn't seem that way...

1190
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:00,370
It's not what you think, we are
completely unsuitable for each other.

1191
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,870
Your character is exactly like your dad.

1192
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:07,490
Do you still think a lot about dad?

1193
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,740
Yes, occasionally.

1194
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,780
Are you still waiting for him?

1195
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:15,570
Yes...

1196
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,530
If your father comes back,

1197
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:23,990
I really want to boast to him
how well I raised you by myself.

1198
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:27,700
- Mom.
- You do not need to worry about me.

1199
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,490
Believe me, keep your hopes up!

1200
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:36,780
Okay, I believe.

1201
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,950
You should have told me earlier,

1202
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:43,280
I thought you already promised
a date with the children.

1203
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,660
But you know...you've
encountered some problems recently.

1204
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:53,160
The parents have quite a few opinions about it.

1205
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,660
You experienced a problem on the program and plus
the plagiarism incident, I'm in a really tough spot.

1206
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:16,820
Your mom said you didn't allow
her to tell me where you were,

1207
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:20,320
I had to beg for a long time
before she finally told me.

1208
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:24,910
Thinking about it, I realized I have never
placed myself in your shoes to face the problem.

1209
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,530
I should have believed in you.

1210
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,240
I'm sorry.

1211
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:38,240
Don't worry,

1212
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:41,910
I have already gotten over it.

1213
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:46,240
Not being able to host the radio
program, and not being able to sing,

1214
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:50,240
were the result of me messing up.

1215
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:58,280
Don't give up on singing.

1216
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:01,780
Remember you once said...

1217
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:06,530
That you already understood what you should sing.

1218
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,240
<i>Continue singing.</i>

1219
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:32,320
sunbaenim, so you're actually the producer?
(sunbaenim - respected senior/mentor)

1220
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,780
Nothing is certain yet, I haven't
even prepared myself and,

1221
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,070
it is a bit abrupt... Wow, hyeong!

1222
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:46,490
Hey, work that doesn't receive
remuneration always feels extremely practical.

1223
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:50,030
Sin Jin A, welcome to my world. It's Dream Factory!

1224
01:27:57,450 --> 01:27:58,570
Then, let's begin.

1225
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:02,070
<i>1, 2, 3, 4.</i>

1226
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:06,200
~ <i>I did not know that the past memories</i> ~

1227
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:08,320
~ <i>would be like this,</i> ~

1228
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,100
~ <i>gradually...</i> ~

1229
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,800
This is the feeling.

1230
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:19,100
~ <i>What has obviously already been discarded,</i> ~

1231
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,700
~ <i>is now slowly being recalled.</i> ~

1232
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:25,370
~ <i>I have obviously already forgotten...</i> ~

1233
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:30,160
~ <i>I put my dedication and heart
and soul into loving you,</i> ~

1234
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,000
~ <i>I put my dedication, without
retaining any effort to hurt you,</i> ~

1235
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:38,160
~ <i>I put my dedication, and I want to
fall into the river of love once again.</i> ~

1236
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:43,570
~ <i>Not once forgetting the bitterness of love,</i> ~

1237
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:46,570
~ <i>not forgiving myself for
once treating you indifferently,</i> ~

1238
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:50,900
~ <i>I want you to know how much I miss you...</i> ~

1239
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,950
~ <i>I put my dedication and heart
and soul into loving you,</i> ~

1240
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:59,000
~ <i>I put my dedication, without
retaining any effort to hurt you,</i> ~

1241
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:04,800
~ <i>I put my dedication, and I want to
fall into the river of love once again.</i> ~

1242
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:09,450
~ <i>Not once forgetting the bitterness of love,</i> ~

1243
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:14,100
~ <i>not forgiving myself for
once treating you indifferently,</i> ~

1244
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:18,150
~ <i>I want you to know how much I miss you...</i> ~

1245
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:21,620
=I sincerely apologize.=

1246
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:25,120
Has Ru Mi's problem been settled?

1247
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,120
Yes. I've already told her to
remain abroad for 2 to 3 months.

1248
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:31,780
=I didn't expect it to cause
such a serious consequence.=

1249
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:36,280
It really leaves me speechless.

1250
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,450
You also better not make any mistakes, understand?

1251
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,780
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- Go out.

1252
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:45,450
=This matter arose all because of me,=

1253
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:49,660
=it is unrelated to anyone else.=

1254
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,780
=That is what I'll like to announce.=

1255
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:56,950
<i>There are so much silly incidents in the office...</i>

1256
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:03,750
Not bad...the atmosphere is
harsh and awkward enough.

1257
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,620
Just get to the main topic.

1258
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:08,490
Why must you have such a grim attitude?

1259
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:12,740
Since your sudden visit last time,

1260
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:15,240
<i>I learnt and understood a lot.</i>

1261
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:17,780
That's why this time, aren't
I trying to help you guys?

1262
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:25,410
Is this regarding the public broadcast
event of the 1000th episode?

1263
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,570
Television and radio will have live broadcasts.

1264
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:31,370
Let's use Representative Lee's manpower to arrange.

1265
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:39,280
That's a good idea,

1266
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:42,570
but I will decide the list of appearances,

1267
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,870
and of course you do not need to
worry about Representative Lee's people.

1268
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:49,410
That is of course, you're the PD.

1269
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:54,280
But I'm very curious what
hidden card you have in your hands...

1270
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:55,870
It's Miss Sin Jin A.

1271
01:30:57,070 --> 01:31:00,990
No...no, but even if the matter has been settled,

1272
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,990
isn't it a bit too early?

1273
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,280
I will submit my proposal plan.

1274
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,490
- Then, I'll take my leave.
- Hey, PD Lee.

1275
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,200
Hey, PD Lee!

1276
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:10,120
Hey, you...

1277
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:17,030
PD Lee...

1278
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:27,240
Do you think the blow is greater if the
radio station has one less capable PD?

1279
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:31,570
Or if the people controlling the program

1280
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:37,780
such as the DJ and others leave
would deal a greater blow?

1281
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:41,030
Representative Lee,

1282
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:43,410
are you trying to threaten me?

1283
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:48,990
It seems that way.

1284
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,320
Go ahead and use Sin Jin A,

1285
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,160
but wager this.

1286
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,820
Give me my handphone.

1287
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,160
Here it is.

1288
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:19,660
<i>Where did Yong Shik oppa go?</i>

1289
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,820
<i>Representative Lee was looking
for him so he left hastily.</i>

1290
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:24,160
<i>He didn't even tell me my schedule for today.</i>

1291
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:25,660
<i>He asked you to wait for a while.</i>

1292
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,160
Mi Ra,

1293
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,160
Have you been getting on well?

1294
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,740
You actually came to find me. Is there anything?

1295
01:32:40,410 --> 01:32:43,570
I...have rumors about being
from a girl's home right?

1296
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:45,120
I don't really want to listen.

1297
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:46,870
That is not a rumor.

1298
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,320
During my Secondary 2 school days,
I was on the way home after being dismissed

1299
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:58,120
when I saw my stepfather abusing my mother.

1300
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,240
I had to stop him no matter what...

1301
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,620
But when I withdrew my actions, I discovered...

1302
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,410
that I had already killed him.

1303
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,910
It was the day before our last concert,

1304
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,700
when a reporter called and said that
he wanted to expose that incident.

1305
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:21,490
Jin A said that,

1306
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:26,410
as long as Purple disbands,
only then can we stop that report.

1307
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:33,030
She said to let her see me being
branded as a murderer my whole life,

1308
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,450
is something she couldn't do.

1309
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:40,570
What's the point of you
coming to tell me this now?

1310
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:41,820
<i>I do not care.</i>

1311
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:44,950
I have to go now.

1312
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:47,030
Mi Ra,

1313
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:51,490
don't hate Jin A so much.

1314
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,660
I said I do not care.

1315
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:04,990
Please sign your autograph.

1316
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:21,450
You must treasure Sin Jin A's historic
comeback album like it's a family heirloom.

1317
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:26,780
Oh right, about the matter I mentioned
regarding the radio station's reinstatement...

1318
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:30,780
I already said I don't want to work there...

1319
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:34,950
Very soon it will be Wonderful Radio's
1000 episode special broadcast,

1320
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,120
I hope that will be Miss Jin A's comeback stage.

1321
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,280
I don't have the confidence.

1322
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:47,450
Why? The accomplishments of
Wonderful Radio are all because of you.

1323
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:51,280
So, I hope you will definitely stand on that stage.

1324
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:56,620
I am now formally inviting
you using my status as PD.

1325
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:59,620
I'll count on you.

1326
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:04,950
Oh, and this is my present for you.
Take a look at it when you're home.

1327
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:07,950
<i>Hey, singer Sin Jin A!</i>

1328
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:11,900
Here, I also have a gift for you.

1329
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,280
Hey, this...

1330
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:15,780
Are you trying to demonstrate the
strength of your wrist infront of me?

1331
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,620
Gift, my gift.

1332
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:21,120
It's okay, it's okay...

1333
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,240
=<i>Hyeong, must we really do it like this?</i>=

1334
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:46,450
=<i>What's wrong? Didn't you make a promise?</i>=

1335
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:48,870
=<i>- But hyeong...
- Enough nonsense, quick catch up.</i>=

1336
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:50,140
=<i> - Let's start. </i>
- It's not like this...=

1337
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:55,240
=Hyeong, wait! One more time, wait...=

1338
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:23,280
=Hyeong! I really can't do it!=

1339
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:27,410
=Will she like it even if I do this?=

1340
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:31,030
=<i>Just believe me. A split second of embarrassment
can guarantee you a lifetime of love.</i>=

1341
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:33,870
=<i>Come, it's the 4th take.</i>=

1342
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:40,990
=<i>Does it really have to be like this?</i>=

1343
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:43,620
=<i>Of course, didn't you promise me?</i>=

1344
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:46,830
=Hyeong, just wait and see.
I must take revenge on you.=

1345
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:48,990
=Hyeong, you know that I really can't sing...=

1346
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:51,700
=<i>You're a grown man, why are
you going back on your word?</i>=

1347
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,740
Hey! Don't you know
how to bid farewell?

1348
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:27,410
Ajussi! Can you stop playing
songs that are so old?

1349
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:30,370
You, this...this...don't you
know whose song this is?

1350
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:31,700
Whose song?

1351
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,910
This...how should I phrase it?

1352
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,410
The predecessor of predecessors,

1353
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:40,620
The start of idols...and then the end.

1354
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,120
An eternal evil spirit,

1355
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:45,620
and she also doesn't age. Do you know Purple...

1356
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:54,780
This is Purple's "You're My Angel".

1357
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,620
Ajussi, let's just go quickly.

1358
01:38:07,780 --> 01:38:09,080
Hello?

1359
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,620
Hello!

1360
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:16,330
What?

1361
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:29,700
<i>I love you, Sin Jin A!</i>

1362
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:30,740
<i>Sin Jin A!</i>

1363
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,240
I have already confirmed the
program's performance sequence.

1364
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:15,160
Do you really have to do this?

1365
01:39:15,370 --> 01:39:17,370
Don't you what kind of person
Representative Lee is?

1366
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:20,200
You'll only hurt yourself if
you continue on like this!

1367
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:25,280
General Manager,

1368
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,700
I want to do the program
according to my wishes.

1369
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:38,120
I'm sorry.

1370
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,530
eonni!

1371
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:47,530
eonni...

1372
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:51,580
How have you been?

1373
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:53,580
You've become more beautiful.

1374
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,740
It was tough, wasn't it?

1375
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:58,740
It was tough, because you weren't around.

1376
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:06,280
Eonni, hurry up. Yong Shik oppa
wants you to get out quickly.

1377
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:15,200
Where did you get this from?

1378
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:18,530
Oh, at the terminal...

1379
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:22,740
But, so what if she releases a new album?
It can't change anything as it is over for her.

1380
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:43,080
But...will Sin Jin A really
perform at this public broadcast?

1381
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:47,620
If she really comes, Representative Lee
will surely not give up so easily.

1382
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:58,240
Oppa, its me.

1383
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,200
I'll be there soon.

1384
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,910
=Okay, come quickly.=

1385
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:03,900
That...oppa.

1386
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,120
=Why? Tell me, what is it? Why, why, why...=

1387
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,370
It's regarding Jin A going on stage today.

1388
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:11,700
=No need to worry, I'll see what
to do about it, believe me.=

1389
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:14,200
No, it's not like that...

1390
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:20,240
- =What's wrong?=
- I no longer bother whether
or not Jin A goes onto the stage.

1391
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,740
=What are you talking about?=

1392
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,450
=Don't talk nonsense.=

1393
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:27,910
=And Mi Ra, this isn't just about you.
It also concerns my self-esteem.=

1394
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,950
=Furthermore, even if Sin Jin A comes, there
is no way she'll be able to stand on the stage.=

1395
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:32,450
=Do you understand? I'm hanging up!=

1396
01:41:32,450 --> 01:41:33,780
Oppa. Oppa!

1397
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:37,080
Eonni, we have to faster go.
Come out quickly!

1398
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:46,410
- Have the guests being checked?
- Yes.

1399
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:49,240
Hey, did you know that Miss Jin A is here?

1400
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:55,450
If you're glad then at least smile a bit...

1401
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58,280
Okay, it's the last commercial.

1402
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:59,160
Okay.

1403
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,950
1...2...cue!

1404
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:16,370
Hello everybody, today we finally usher in

1405
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:18,160
Wonderful Radio's 1000 episode.

1406
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:22,120
Thank you everyone for being able to
attend this rather significant activity today.

1407
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:25,780
Today's spectators also consists of a lot of

1408
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:27,660
lead characters who had shared
their life experiences with us before.

1409
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:29,620
Im Sul Ki! Im Sul Ki!

1410
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:35,840
Wonderful Radio, wonderful life,

1411
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,100
will now officially begin.

1412
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:37,620
I heard that you released a new album.
I should have at least congratulated you

1413
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:39,780
through Kakao Talk, but I was so busy
that I forgot about it.
(Kakao Talk - messaging app for phones)

1414
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:44,080
I have to prepare for the performance,
can you just come to the main point?

1415
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,280
What's so urgent?

1416
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:55,240
When Purple disbanded, I should
have insisted keeping you.

1417
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:00,580
Mi Ra is good at everything,
except that she doesn't have the tenacity.

1418
01:44:01,870 --> 01:44:03,410
But you do.

1419
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:09,580
Your tenacity of being able to bet
on the PD's life and go on stage,

1420
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:12,200
is something Mi Ra is unable
to do. It's a little regretful.

1421
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,830
What did you just say?

1422
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:18,990
PD's life?

1423
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,410
PD Lee's life.

1424
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:25,160
Nuna!

1425
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,120
Your dongsaeng is really tall.
(dongsaeng - younger brother)

1426
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:33,490
<i>I will appreciate it well.</i>

1427
01:45:03,870 --> 01:45:08,370
PD, something big went wrong.
Jin A nuna is now...

1428
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:08,740
Hurry, hurry...

1429
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:13,100
Why? What's wrong with Jin A nuna?

1430
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:27,870
What's wrong? Faster tell me what's wrong!

1431
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:31,700
Why didn't you tell me what
you wagered on this stage?

1432
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:35,200
Do you think my heart will feel
comfortable by you doing this?

1433
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:37,700
I cannot step on this stage.

1434
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,200
Are you running away?

1435
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:48,990
Have you not thought about the
spectators who are waiting to hear you sing?

1436
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:53,160
More importantly, those who
support you are waiting for you.

1437
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:57,280
Purple disbanded and the
accusation of plagiarism was fake...

1438
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:03,030
Do you think by sacrificing yourself,
you'll be able to help others?

1439
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:18,950
Just sing, do it for yourself,

1440
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:23,370
and...do it for me.

1441
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:11,830
Oh, mom.

1442
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:14,490
=My princess, did you remember to eat?=

1443
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,830
No...

1444
01:47:17,830 --> 01:47:20,740
=Hey! You have to eat in order to sing well...=

1445
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:27,410
=Jin A, mom and dad will be here to hear you sing,=

1446
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:30,950
=so don't be nervous and do well.
Do you understand?=

1447
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,580
=Wretch, why are you not saying anything?=

1448
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:41,870
=Our Jin A, faster get over it and come home
soon. Tonight, let's drink till our fill, okay?=

1449
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,620
- I understand.
- =What?=

1450
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:48,490
- I said I understand. Let's hang up.
- =Fighting!=

1451
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:09,450
Prepare the lines.

1452
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:31,100
Next, we will like to invite the
last guest of our second segment.

1453
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:40,870
Speaking about Wonderful Radio,
we certainly cannot forget to mention her, right?

1454
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:46,530
Since the beginning of Wonderful Radio till
now, she has always been a guardian by our sides.

1455
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:20,870
Only until not long ago, she has
always been the center of Wonderful Radio.

1456
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:23,870
She was also once the leader
of Purple, Miss Sin Jin A.

1457
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,200
Please welcome her with a
warm round of applause.

1458
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:45,740
Hello. To be able to once again
greet everyone in Wonderful Radio,

1459
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:49,410
makes me really happy. I am singer Sin Jin A.

1460
01:49:56,910 --> 01:50:01,280
During the time when Purple was active
and when I was hosting Wonderful Radio,

1461
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:07,910
I used to often say 'thank you'
and 'I love you' to everyone.

1462
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:12,410
Actually, those were only what
were written in the script,

1463
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:18,620
and not because of my sincerity.
The reason for me returning here is because...

1464
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:24,200
I feel that I can now really
sincerely say to everyone

1465
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:31,500
thank you, and I love you.

1466
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:35,410
To me, Wonderful Radio is a kind of love.

1467
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:43,530
After leaving here in that way, I have
really missed this stage and everyone as well.

1468
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:49,700
Everyone...thank you.

1469
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:52,500
I love you.

1470
01:50:57,950 --> 01:51:03,450
Next, I'll like to perform for everyone
my song called "Again". Thank you.

1471
01:51:15,950 --> 01:51:17,280
Where are you going?

1472
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:20,450
Come back quickly, this is a live broadcast.

1473
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,620
<i>Turn off the lights!</i>

1474
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:10,660
<i>Wait. What do you think you're doing?</i>

1475
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:17,490
Hyeongnim, hyeongnim...do you
think I'm doing a non-profitable sale?

1476
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:25,370
From today onwards, our DJ and
everyone else will withdraw from SBS!
(SBS - South Korean television and radio network)

1477
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,280
- Withdraw then.
- All to be withdrawn!

1478
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:36,370
- What did you say?
- I asked you to withdraw everyone.

1479
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:41,830
Even without you, there is a whole row of people
who wants to collaborate with us. Do you know?

1480
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:48,410
You just try and see. I will ban everyone from
your company from entering the television station.

1481
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:53,080
Hyeongnim, that wasn't what I meant...

1482
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:57,080
- Wait...
- Please go out, please go out.

1483
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:59,240
- Hyeongnim, please don't misunderstand my intention.
- Please go out.

1484
01:53:59,410 --> 01:54:03,740
I will wait for you at the cafe near the entrance.

1485
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:06,910
Aigoo, not like he's a hooligan.

1486
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:39,740
I've searched for you for a long time.

1487
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,910
But then, what kind of relationship do we have?

1488
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:52,490
We are not meeting with the
identities of PD and DJ, right?

1489
01:55:56,030 --> 01:55:57,330
Yes.

1490
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:03,490
What kind of PD would even bet this on a ex-DJ?

1491
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:18,120
This...is what the General Manager gave you.

1492
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,700
I also have something to give you.

1493
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:11,030
Here, house beat...

1494
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:15,030
and to cultivate the mood, there
will be some rock and then shouting...

1495
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:17,870
How was that?

1496
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:22,530
Yes, yes...I also don't feel this is very good.

1497
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:28,030
Then let's take a look at this. Here, there's
another one. Here...a sorrowful lyrical song.

1498
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:33,030
The prelude will be 'I love you, I love you'.
Baek Ji Young originally wanted
this song but I refused and hid it,

1499
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:34,900
to keep it for you.

1500
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:37,500
Just 3 minutes. Just 3 minutes.

1501
01:57:37,870 --> 01:57:40,910
Remake of senior Lee Mi Ja's

1502
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:43,490
best-selling song, "Miss Dong Baek".

1503
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:46,200
This is the hip-hop version. This part...

1504
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:49,370
~ Dong Baek ~...I used the staggered beat here.

1505
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:52,160
~ <i>With 200 people standing in a row,
let them all wear shorts.</i> ~

1506
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:55,240
~ <i>Miss...Dong...Baek...</i> ~

1507
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:59,700
This song really causes people
to have goose-bumps, right?

1508
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:03,800
- You've worked hard.
- No, no, no! Wait...it's not like that.

1509
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:04,920
Jin A!

1510
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:08,590
=This is a beautiful early morning,
I am Gim Jang Wan.=

1511
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:11,340
=Hello everybody, this is
Love Game's Pak So Hyeon.=

1512
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:14,130
=The next song I'm going to broadcast
is an  extremely special song.=

1513
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:17,710
=She got rid of the social stigma of
plagiarism and has finally started over.=

1514
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:20,170
=- She was once Purple's leader...
- Once Purple's leader.=

1515
01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:23,050
