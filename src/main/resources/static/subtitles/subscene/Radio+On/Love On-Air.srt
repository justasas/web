1
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,252
You should cut back on coffee.

2
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:36,812
You're not getting any younger.

3
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:39,057
I'II get the most expensive facial treatment
when my album comes out.

4
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,820
Ha ha, very funny.

5
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:42,291
Your script for part 3 and 4.

6
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:44,886
Who are they?

7
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:45,764
Coby Girls.

8
00:01:45,764 --> 00:01:47,466
It's not Dalshabet?

9
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:48,865
Can we please get someone

10
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,060
that people actually know?

11
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,971
I'm more than grateful that
they agreed to come on the show.

12
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:54,233
Go into the studio.

13
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,835
PIease book a boy band next week.

14
00:01:57,976 --> 00:01:59,944
Can we get Beast?

15
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,638
Two, three...

16
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:05,012
Hi! We're Coby Girls!

17
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,847
How pretty you all are!

18
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,976
Let's have a good show.

19
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:10,214
We'II do our best!

20
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,348
My word of advice would be

21
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,789
'always be polite.'

22
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,054
I didn't think much of it back in the day

23
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,322
when I was in Purple.

24
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:21,666
You were a singer?

25
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:26,626
You haven't heard of Purple?

26
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:28,730
You mean Iike
Tinky Winky?

27
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:33,106
10 seconds to go, Jina.

28
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:33,940
Sure.

29
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:44,315
In part 3 and 4,

30
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,958
we'II be with the new girl group,
Coby Girls.

31
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,661
Hi, everyone!
We're Coby Girls!

32
00:02:49,661 --> 00:02:53,825
They are sensational,
energetic,

33
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:57,969
audacious and clueless

34
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,274
Iike the fish in the pond.

35
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:04,435
Wow!
Thank you so much!

36
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:09,906
We'II start part 3 with
Coby Girls' hit single,

37
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,208
Get out boy!

38
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,861
So you don't know
who Purple is?

39
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,463
How old are you?

40
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:26,829
- I'm twenty-one.
- Eighteen!

41
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:29,167
Back in 2004,
when Korea was...

42
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,572
Get out, boy
Out of my Iife

43
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,039
Great song!

44
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:41,036
How do I know this tune?

45
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,410
Hang on a second.

46
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:47,853
Recording was so hard...

47
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,514
Shut up for a minute!

48
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:52,518
Bro!

49
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,160
You gotta check this out.
It's genius.

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,628
Shin Jina is here.

51
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:00,731
- What?
- It's Jina.

52
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,873
- Oh shit!
- You!

53
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:08,673
Listen to me, honey.

54
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:09,674
Calm down, Jina.

55
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:11,376
We need to talk.

56
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,879
That song was meant for me!

57
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,649
Let's take a seat first.

58
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,951
- Open this door!
- PIease?

59
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,153
- Don't touch me!
- Let him explain.

60
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:23,017
Let go of me!

61
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:24,219
PIease.

62
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:26,724
Get over here.

63
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,721
Get your ass over here, now!

64
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:35,431
Honey, I know you're really pissed.
I understand.

65
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,229
I totally sympathize with you.
But!

66
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:46,041
You gotta gather your senses
especially...

67
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,150
You wrote this song for me.

68
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,453
But once I got the Iyrics...

69
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:57,756
It was suitable for a girl group.

70
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,814
Hey!

71
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:05,728
My wife is due next month.

72
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:07,566
We're having twins.

73
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,868
It means double the cost
of everything.

74
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:13,531
I'm in a tight spot.

75
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:19,639
And more importantly,
girl groups are the trend.

76
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:22,239
I'm very disappointed in you.

77
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:26,511
I'm not taking songs from you
ever again!

78
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:32,022
- See you Iater, sir.
- Jina, wait!

79
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,833
Ouch!

80
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:51,332
What's on schedule tomorrow?

81
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:56,448
I'II text it to you
when I get home.

82
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:58,507
Tell me now.

83
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:04,812
You're booked
for a special private concert

84
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:10,362
for Sangmun elementary reunion,
class of 89.

85
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:12,764
What?!
I, Shin Jina, is to sing

86
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:17,827
at an elementary class reunion?

87
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:19,070
Cancel it.

88
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,475
Our overdraft account is
almost maxed out

89
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:27,879
and I have no money
to buy shampoo.

90
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,714
I told you my album is
coming out soon.

91
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:40,358
Hi!

92
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,059
Hello, Mrs. Shin.

93
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:44,222
How are you?
Grab some supper.

94
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:47,022
Hey!

95
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:52,170
Well, actually... I have to Iook over
tomorrow's schedule.

96
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,331
So, maybe next time.

97
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:58,338
- Bye.
- Stay! Wait!

98
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:03,948
Why are you being such a bitch to him?

99
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:06,815
There is no-one Iike him.
Be nice.

100
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,919
You're not even
paying him properly.

101
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:12,323
Why didn't you
take the day off?

102
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm refreshed
and ready to work.

103
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,365
You never Iisten to me.
It not Iike you have any customer.

104
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:24,324
Don't be silly.

105
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:28,728
Hello!
PIease, come in.

106
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:32,934
You see?
Six people! Yay!

107
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,514
What a pretty girl!

108
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:43,514
This is the best spot
in the neighborhood.

109
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:45,322
What should we get?

110
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:47,659
I'II bring you the menu.

111
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:50,219
Won't be a moment.

112
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,536
Jina...

113
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:12,615
I celebrate two Christmases
every year.

114
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,114
One in December
and one in June.

115
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:20,816
This is the week I decided
to call summer Christmas week.

116
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:25,420
I haven't decided what
I'm going to ask Santa

117
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:30,225
for this Christmas in June.

118
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:36,330
Why don't you
put your June wishes

119
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,576
in the wish box

120
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:43,513
for Santa Clause
who must be bored to death

121
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:46,612
at this time of the year.

122
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,623
PIease don't Iet me
be Ionely this Christmas.

123
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:07,329
In part 2, we'II have
text messages from Iisteners.

124
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,176
It's people
that frustrate you

125
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,379
but also people that
turn dispair into hope.

126
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:18,650
Thank you, for the nice quote
and flowers.

127
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,518
Here is your requested song
from After School...

128
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,223
Actually, can I play
my request today?

129
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,062
It's Purple's
"You're my Angel"

130
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:32,263
- What's she doing?
- Hmm.

131
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:37,068
The producer of this show
who's been with us for 4 years

132
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:41,027
is taking a temporary Ieave
to have her baby.

133
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:46,235
This is from my heart.
Best of Iuck and see you again soon.

134
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:54,311
She's filling up the time
with her old songs?

135
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,259
You asked for me?

136
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,319
Take a seat.

137
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:11,369
Let me cut to the chase. I want you
to take charge of Wonderful Radio.

138
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:12,770
You mean Yun's show?

139
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,875
The ratings are atrocious.

140
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,077
They'II talk about dropping Jina
in the fall program reshuffle.

141
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,679
But the show is Iike
Yun's baby.

142
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,513
And the ratings reflect her Iove,
at only 2 percent.

143
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:29,354
I'II take care of Yun.

144
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:33,814
I need you to bring in
a fresh touch to the show.

145
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,362
- Lock up when you Ieave.
- Sure.

146
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:14,229
You should go home time to time.

147
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,625
See you Iater.

148
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,325
- See ya.
- Bye.

149
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,533
- Where are you going, man?
- Did you bring my spec 55 back?

150
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,274
I forgot.
I'II bring it next time.

151
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:27,540
- Can't use that because of you.
- AIright. I'm sorry.

152
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,512
What bring you here?

153
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:33,316
Heard you're joining us
as new producer.

154
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:36,011
Wonderful Radio.

155
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,313
- Beer?
- Give me one.

156
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:42,060
How come
they're sending you?

157
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,562
You can't play the songs
you Iike on our show.

158
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:46,826
- What is she Iike?
- Jina?

159
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,830
She's a princess.

160
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:55,638
The type I detest.

161
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:58,537
You're not exactly
her type either.

162
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:01,641
I guess.

163
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,352
Can you drive properly
for once?

164
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:12,657
You know this van used to make
squealy noise when I brake?

165
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:15,159
I had it Iooked at
at the service station.

166
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,423
See if you can still hear it.

167
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:23,533
Cha Dae-geun!

168
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:30,536
Shall I give her a call?

169
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:37,710
Hurry!

170
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,453
What took you so Iong?

171
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:43,855
Do you have make-up remover?

172
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:46,657
- What do you need it for?
- I got smudges.

173
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:50,061
I heard the new producer
is a bit of an ass.

174
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,926
- I heard that, too. A total asshole.
- Shutsh.

175
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,768
He's here?

176
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:58,633
For a while already.

177
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:04,575
How are you, sir?
I'm Shin Jina's trusted manager.

178
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,440
- You know, rumors are just...
- What's the time now?

179
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:11,349
We had to wait for the Ms Shin
for half an hour. What do you think?

180
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:15,115
Well, the traffic was terrible
for one...

181
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:20,258
We made introductions
before you arrive.

182
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,761
My thought is that we keep
most of the structure as it is.

183
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,025
There is one thing though.

184
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:28,229
Love Equation of My Life

185
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,433
It's just too corny.

186
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:35,173
I Iike that segment.
And the Iisteners Iove it too.

187
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:37,375
Besides, a bit of corniness
does good for the ratings.

188
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,139
- Aren't I right? Right?
- Who said that Iisteners Iove it?

189
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,454
I want ideas for a new segment
by 11:00 tomorrow morning.

190
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,456
- That's a Iittle...
- too short-noticed.

191
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:56,519
Hey, you can't google new ideas
from off their heads.

192
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,663
Don't you know how hard it is
to come up with a new segment...

193
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,029
Isn't that what
writers are for?

194
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,129
Why do you keep
interrupting me?

195
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,373
Since this is our first meeting,
we should make introductions

196
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:12,577
and have a group dinner
or drinks to break the ice.

197
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:14,044
Aren't I right? Right?

198
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:19,011
You have beautiful eyes.

199
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,813
I get that a Iot.

200
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,556
I gotta go.

201
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:31,825
Esprresso with extra shot
for a chic city man...

202
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:34,923
Damn!

203
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:45,241
Lower down slowly
one vertebra at a time.

204
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,849
- Move to Jungle postion.
- Hi, sweetie.

205
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,111
Hey you!

206
00:14:58,156 --> 00:15:00,057
How is Producer Yun?
Is she doing okay?

207
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,459
She went to have her baby.

208
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,723
Who's taking her place?

209
00:15:04,061 --> 00:15:05,619
We got a new producer.

210
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:08,266
- A male?
- Yes.

211
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,928
but he is a total BCM.

212
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:13,171
A BIase City Man?

213
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:15,833
No, a Big-headed City Moron.

214
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:22,310
Well, the real morons were...
Coby Girls?

215
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:24,448
I could have given them a good smack.

216
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:25,915
If only I met them
back in the day.

217
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,712
We were the business
back in the day.

218
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:33,516
Remember the sound we used to
hear every weekend?

219
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,028
Ans this weeks No. 1 goes to...
Puuuurple!

220
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,324
I would Iike to thank
all our fans and

221
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:44,268
our supporters from "Purple Scent".
I Iove every one of you!

222
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:49,273
PIease give it up for Purple
performing "You're my Angel"!

223
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:54,836
¢Ý You are my angel, angel,
angel to me

224
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:59,916
¢Ý I'll cherish your love
forever and ever

225
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,815
¢Ý You're my angel...

226
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:07,158
See you all again.

227
00:16:07,158 --> 00:16:09,922
We Iove you!

228
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,933
I miss the days.

229
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:28,042
Camera,

230
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,513
- Roll!
- 3 of 23,

231
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:32,407
Action!

232
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:49,932
Cut! That Iooks good.
Stop. That's enough.

233
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,869
Hey, camera!
Get a close-up.

234
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:52,970
Was that an okay, director?

235
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,028
Okay.

236
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:55,832
I said okay already.

237
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:58,933
You did great, Mira.

238
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:03,306
Cut! Cut! That's good.
Fanstastic.

239
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:06,651
- One more take!
- We got no time.

240
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,610
- Are we making a movie here?
- Fine. That was great, Mr. Lee.

241
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:15,559
You should think about
making commercials in series.

242
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,862
They used good old Mama Kim

243
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,163
for the seasoning commercial
for decades

244
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,567
and the same grizzly bear
for Iiver supplelment ads.

245
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:27,071
Segi Hearing Aid campaign went on
for a decade with just the Ieft ear.

246
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:30,474
The fat-and-tall duo practically
grew old with the pump company.

247
00:17:30,474 --> 00:17:33,238
- Think along the same Iine with Mira.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:40,151
I'm having great days
because of your boys and girls.

249
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:45,356
I owe it all to you.

250
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:49,725
Especially the 10 o'clock girl group,

251
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,462
what are they called again?

252
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:53,726
- Pink Dolls?
- That's right!

253
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:57,132
The rating is fantastic.

254
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:00,371
You did good
picking the right host.

255
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:04,375
10 O'clock Iisteners are
mostly students

256
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,478
so girl or boy band is right.

257
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:11,649
6 o'clock is all about people
getting off work and taxi drivers.

258
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:14,552
so, you want a popular face,

259
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:18,818
Someone Iike Yun Mira, for example.
What do you think?

260
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:22,020
- Mira?
- Yeah.

261
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,261
- Sounds good.
- Right?

262
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:25,162
That's right.

263
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:29,567
Nan-sol put a Iot of thought
into that.

264
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,625
And?

265
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:34,972
How can you dismiss her Iike that

266
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:36,574
when she tried so hard?

267
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,042
I don't care about working hard.
I care about doing well.

268
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:45,049
There are three virtues
that make a good radio host.

269
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:48,052
Popularity, talent and personality.

270
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:53,319
Shouldn't you have
at Ieast one of them?

271
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:57,261
Why are you telling me this?

272
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:02,028
I want you to refrain from displaying
your emotion during a meeting.

273
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:13,839
What's it gonna take?

274
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:15,145
4 percent.

275
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,910
Only 4?

276
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:23,016
You never surpassed 2 percent
in the Iast 6 months.

277
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,514
You shouldn't be hung up on the past.
You should dream big.

278
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:34,525
Why don't you come up with
an idea for a new segment, then?

279
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,534
Me? Ha ha ha...

280
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,673
Why not?
I can totally do it.

281
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:45,876
I'II do it.

282
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:49,107
No problem.
I can do it.

283
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,415
I'II Iook forward to it, then.

284
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:04,626
Where did he come from?

285
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,421
What am I supposed to do?

286
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:09,732
Shall we get the next one?

287
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,332
Never mind.

288
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,337
Oh, hi!

289
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:18,132
Long time.

290
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:25,005
I Iike your TV series.

291
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,512
I'm glad you Iike it.

292
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,613
But I'm sorry.

293
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,060
I never get the chance to
Iisten to your radio

294
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,324
when that's the only thing
you do.

295
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,526
You gotta do better
than that, Jina.

296
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:51,333
After walking out
on Purple Iike that!

297
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:58,608
Bye.

298
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:16,827
You're my angel, angel,
angel to me

299
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,770
I'II cherish your Iove
forever and ever.

300
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,237
Jina!

301
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:30,410
You're perfect today
Iike you were yesterday.

302
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:36,309
There is nothing
I want to ask of you.

303
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:41,023
The way you Iook at me
makes me feel great.

304
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:46,964
I can understand
your every gaze.

305
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:52,231
You read my mind.
I give all my heart to you.

306
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,874
I only want to give you joy

307
00:21:56,874 --> 00:22:02,179
You're my angel, angel,
angel to me.

308
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:06,750
I'II cherish your Iove
forever and ever.

309
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,116
I got mid-terms tomorrow!

310
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,321
But you're way more important
than exams to me!

311
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:20,119
I'm nobody without you.

312
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:27,226
You're my angel.

313
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:38,405
One more time! One more time!

314
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,018
You're not gonna make
the announcement now, are you?

315
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,362
Don't, Jina.

316
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:53,364
Give it another thought, please.

317
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:55,423
It doesn't have to be today.

318
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:03,333
Thank you all for coming
to our show tonight.

319
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:07,136
Tonight,

320
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:13,812
I would Iike to make
an important announcement.

321
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:22,615
As of this moment,
Purple is splitting up.

322
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,331
No! Is she serious?

323
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:29,727
Thank you guys...

324
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,732
for all your Iove and support.

325
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:58,324
Extend the other arm
to the side.

326
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:05,533
Look at the tip of the hand.

327
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:13,137
Those who can, fold your arm
and Iock your hands together.

328
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,340
Breathe in.

329
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:18,208
Breathe out.

330
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,317
Breathing in slowly,

331
00:24:21,852 --> 00:24:24,013
expanding your Iungs
and chest.

332
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:29,319
Breathe out and relax
your strained muscles.

333
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,724
Focus only on yourself
during the practice.

334
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,832
How do you know each other?

335
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,476
He's the new producer
I told you about.

336
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:49,546
From the radio?
The BCM?

337
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:51,104
Hey!

338
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:57,513
How do you know each other?

339
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:03,522
Don't you know
Ji In-yeong from Purple?

340
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:06,119
You don't know me?

341
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:10,128
The curvaceous In-yeong?

342
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,030
Right...

343
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,317
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

344
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:40,124
What!

345
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:44,067
- What's wrong with him?
- You forgot your push-ups.

346
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,934
Can't wear them
during yoga!

347
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:51,830
Good to meet you.
Let's work hard.

348
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:54,678
Why don't you
take them out for dinner?

349
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,702
Yes, sir.

350
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,905
See you around.

351
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,920
Are we goddamn Unicef?

352
00:26:06,256 --> 00:26:09,359
They Iook Iike orphans
from third world.

353
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,261
What are you going to do
about me?

354
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:13,627
Give me some time.
It's sweeps week soon.

355
00:26:13,764 --> 00:26:14,924
Are you sure about this?

356
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:17,868
We have the hottest
hosts and DJs.

357
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,169
What have you got
to worry about?

358
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:25,475
So, take care of this
once and for all.

359
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:29,309
Taking care of things is
what I do.

360
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:34,413
Let's get something to eat.

361
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,713
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

362
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,157
I heard about it. Is it true?

363
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:42,421
...that I moved to 6 o'clock?

364
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,217
I mean working with Shin Jina.

365
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,865
- Do you know her?
- Of course.

366
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:51,068
She was a regular on our show
in the Purple days.

367
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,070
They were great.
I Ioved their song.

368
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,671
You're my angel...

369
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:58,475
I ran into her the other day.
She asked me about you.

370
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:00,978
- What did you tell her?
- That you're an asshole.

371
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:02,546
Well, you are.

372
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:04,912
AII the hosts despise you.

373
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:08,952
Anyway, be good to her.

374
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:11,154
She's not what she seems.

375
00:27:11,154 --> 00:27:13,557
She's Ioyal, sexy and
has a pure soul.

376
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,821
Unlike you, asshole.

377
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,118
How's yoga working out?

378
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:21,265
It's driving me up the wall.
I'm so stiff.

379
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,268
You need to have flexible mind
as well as your body.

380
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,869
It's all about the Yoga Fire.

381
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:27,771
- You know what I'm saying?
- Sure, bro.

382
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,136
- The whole namaste deal.
- That's right.

383
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,831
- Hey,
- Hmm?

384
00:27:31,074 --> 00:27:32,837
Don't drink-and-broadcast again.

385
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:35,946
Technically,
it was 'after'-drinks broadcasting.

386
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,607
- That's right.
- Don't mention that again.

387
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:41,051
- AImost destroyed us.
- That was a sweaty moment.

388
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:43,315
- See you around.
- A nightmare.

389
00:27:43,654 --> 00:27:44,712
You want a drink Iater?

390
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:47,114
- I'II call you.
- Sure. See ya.

391
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:50,818
They say even a person who brushes
your sleeve is predestined by your karma.

392
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:52,863
Look around you.

393
00:27:52,863 --> 00:27:56,667
At this very moment in time,

394
00:27:56,667 --> 00:28:01,127
those around me are
my predestined fates.

395
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:08,041
So are all of you out there who'II be
Iistening to me for the next 2 hours.

396
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,914
You're Iistening to Wonderful Radio,
and I'm your host, Shin Jina.

397
00:28:15,052 --> 00:28:19,716
I have in front of me, the new producer
for our show, Mr. Lee Jin-hyeok.

398
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:24,617
He's a cool guy
who only drinks iced coffee.

399
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:27,826
Let's do a good job together.

400
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:39,934
Ideas for new segment?

401
00:28:53,256 --> 00:28:56,316
How dare you!

402
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,724
Next song, Nan-sol.

403
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:06,929
- Here is the first song.
- Rady?

404
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:11,530
Sistar sings "How dare you".

405
00:29:48,178 --> 00:29:50,408
y shoulders feel stiff
around this time.

406
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:09,423
We'll change song to
"Like Rain, Like Music"

407
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:19,942
The opening song
for part 3 is

408
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:23,408
also a perfect song
for a rainy day Iike today.

409
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:27,506
It's "Like Rain Like Music"
by Kim Gwang-seok.

410
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,329
Who's song is this?

411
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:43,931
Oh, is it by Kim Hyeon-sik?

412
00:30:44,768 --> 00:30:46,827
I'II make correction
after the song.

413
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,431
And you're off the hook?

414
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:53,977
Hey, it was a mistake.

415
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,707
I get the two mixed up
all the time.

416
00:30:56,947 --> 00:30:59,711
How can you get them
mixed up?

417
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,852
Hey, we're in the middle
of a Iive show.

418
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:02,953
- Let go of me.
- Get out of there.

419
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:05,755
And, you call yourself a singer?

420
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:06,813
Get out!

421
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,419
Did you see that?

422
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:13,419
Did you see me slam the table?
What they say about you was true.

423
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:15,932
- They can't hear me outside, right?
- No.

424
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:19,035
You're a dog!
You're goddamn dog.

425
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:23,974
- He must have gotten my message.
- I feel dizzy.

426
00:31:23,974 --> 00:31:25,339
Walk on your paws, bastard!

427
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:29,609
So, the rumor was true.

428
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:41,920
Pretty-face,
you got some time?

429
00:31:47,564 --> 00:31:50,727
I got time
but no energy.

430
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,728
Are you still mad?

431
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:54,971
What's wrong with him?

432
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:57,838
He's a damn psycho!

433
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,577
You know...

434
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:03,808
If someone bad-mouthes the music
I Ioved in my 20s,

435
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:07,715
you can feel offended as if
they're insulting my memories.

436
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:13,056
I wasn't insulting.
I just got the names wrong.

437
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,617
If anyone referred to
Purple as Pink,

438
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,522
I know I'd flip out
there and then.

439
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:32,240
This is his heydays.
Listen to it on your way home.

440
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:39,213
It gets further
¢Ýand further away.

441
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:49,359
¢Ýwhat I thought was
¢Ýa lingering youth

442
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,422
¢ÝWithin my emptying heart,

443
00:32:56,666 --> 00:33:02,229
¢Ýl can't find anything anymore.

444
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:10,809
¢ÝEven though the seasons returns,

445
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:31,029
BCM - Today is deadline
for new segment ideas

446
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:39,241
You got cold?

447
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:46,104
Mom, shall I quit radio?

448
00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:48,410
Do as you please.

449
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:53,113
I don't care
if you sing in a cabaret.

450
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:57,360
How can you talk that way
to your daughter?

451
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,862
I'm Shin Jina from Purple!

452
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:02,025
I'm not done.
I'II sing again.

453
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:05,534
Quiet down, will you?

454
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,131
This all started from the day
you started that radio show.

455
00:34:12,575 --> 00:34:20,812
¢Ý How long should I live

456
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:28,514
¢Ý before I see you again

457
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:38,531
¢Ý Over the river of time,
our love sways

458
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:40,128
That's it.

459
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:46,337
Mom, that's it! I got it.

460
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:49,506
Yes!

461
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:55,008
What's gotten into her?

462
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:28,909
Start gathering stories
so we can start next week.

463
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:36,923
I told you
he would Iike it.

464
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,620
I used to win essay comepetition
back in elementary school.

465
00:35:40,363 --> 00:35:41,125
Let's go!

466
00:35:41,364 --> 00:35:43,525
- One, two, three,
- Go!

467
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:50,573
This is a new segment from the show,

468
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:53,176
The Song I Sing to You

469
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:57,909
The first guest we have on the show
is a 22-year-old soldier

470
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:01,050
who took time off
his precious Ieave.

471
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,213
Shall we hear it from him?

472
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:09,323
My name is Jeong Gwang-tae.
I'm serving in Cheolwon.

473
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:15,229
I came in to talk about this girl
that I have a crush on

474
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,969
who won't return my feelings.

475
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:25,175
I went AWOL Iast year
because of her

476
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:27,877
and got in some serious trouble
for that.

477
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:30,812
You should never go that far.

478
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:34,610
Shall we hear your song then?

479
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:37,720
With all my heart,
I would Iike to sing.

480
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:41,458
Jeong Yeob's 'Nothing Very.'

481
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:45,261
Let's hear it from him.
'Nothing Better'

482
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:50,824
Lim Seul-gi, English Major
at Hanyang University!

483
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:55,231
I'II be your boyfriend
after I get out of the army.

484
00:36:55,371 --> 00:36:57,073
- Wait for me!
- Calm down

485
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:59,940
and Iet's hear you sing,
'Nothing Better'

486
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,046
Suyuri angel, Lim Seul-gi!

487
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,411
Lim Seul-gi!

488
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:19,762
¢Ý Rest in me like in the dreams
and stay with me forever

489
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:22,230
Are you okay, Seul-gi?

490
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:27,432
Would you be okay,
if you were her?

491
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:34,177
¢Ý I would always stay
by your side

492
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:40,450
¢Ý Nothing better,
nothing better than you

493
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,418
For crying out Ioud!

494
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:47,957
I'II kill him!

495
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:49,925
¢Ý Nothing better...

496
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,365
Nothing better than you

497
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:59,669
Driver,
please turn off the radio!

498
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:03,172
We had tons of complaints and

499
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:08,678
criticisms abour your Iittle stunt.

500
00:38:08,678 --> 00:38:12,448
This is actually a good segment.
If you give it some time...

501
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:17,954
Raising the ratings is good but

502
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:22,015
why don't we just drop the program
in the next reshuffle?

503
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,326
Excuse me?

504
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,821
Think about it, okay?

505
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:57,120
What are you doing here?

506
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,763
Did you get told off?

507
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:03,323
Did you think
I got praises for that?

508
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:08,029
I'm sorry.

509
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:12,140
About what?

510
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:17,410
- Well, it was my idea...
- I made the decision.

511
00:39:17,547 --> 00:39:21,210
I take responsibility for my decisions.
That's part of my job.

512
00:39:23,353 --> 00:39:26,618
Don't worry.
I'II take care of my team.

513
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:50,947
Are you trying
to blow up the car?

514
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:53,950
Why didn't you
get it checked?

515
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,954
What are you gonna do
if I'm Iate?

516
00:39:57,954 --> 00:39:58,921
I am so sorry.

517
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:01,919
Grab a taxi. Now!

518
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:11,323
How are you supposed to get
taxi in the middle of the bridge?

519
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:14,827
Save us! PIease!

520
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:16,738
Help!

521
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:24,703
I Iove your show.

522
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:29,514
Thank you.

523
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,516
You have a beautiful child
and a gorgeous wife.

524
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:42,629
What a nice picture!

525
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:51,036
Would you Iike to hear a story?

526
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:53,276
Here's the script.

527
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,078
Where is she?
She changed the guest Iast minute?

528
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,807
She's here.

529
00:41:07,356 --> 00:41:10,519
The Song I Sing to You

530
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,925
We have in the studio
a 42-year-old cab driver.

531
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:19,034
Would you Iike
to tell us your story?

532
00:41:24,474 --> 00:41:25,634
Hi!

533
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:29,645
What's today's story about?

534
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:30,646
Shutsh!

535
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:36,812
I have a Ietter for my wife
which I never got to send her.

536
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:41,314
That why I came
on the show today.

537
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:53,535
Hi, honey!
It's me, Ji-hyeong.

538
00:41:55,671 --> 00:42:00,631
It's been almost 3 years
since you went to heaven.

539
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:03,602
I want to say sorry first

540
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:06,611
for putting you
through a hard Iife.

541
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:09,417
I'm sorry
I never wrote you a Ietter

542
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:13,618
when you were still
with me.

543
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:21,028
I practiced the Dongmulwon song
that you Iiked.

544
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:26,926
You used to tease
for being a terrible singer.

545
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:30,429
So, hear me out.

546
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:45,213
Honey,

00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,518

00:42:52,762 --> 00:42:54,127
... with cancer.

549
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:56,426
Like you.

550
00:42:58,067 --> 00:42:59,932
You must miss her terribly.

551
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,735
I know, honey. But I can't
Iet her go to you just yet.

552
00:43:07,677 --> 00:43:11,909
PIease make her

553
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:16,508
So, she'II grow and get married
and have babies that Iook Iike you.

554
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:21,219
PIease don't take her away.

555
00:43:21,357 --> 00:43:23,222
Let her stay with me.

556
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:26,423
I beg you.

557
00:43:28,464 --> 00:43:29,624
I'm so sorry.

558
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,928
Excuse me.

559
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:58,361

¢Ýmore than anyone

572
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:43,429
- Hello, Mr. Lee!
- Hi.

573
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:47,370
Why did you say hi?

574
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,671
He is your dad.

575
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,774
- Urgh!
- Hey, wait.

576
00:45:51,774 --> 00:45:54,038
Forget it.

577
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:57,307
- Wait!
- No!

578
00:46:14,663 --> 00:46:17,029
Did you have dinner,
sweetheart?

579
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,626
Answer your dad.

580
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:23,433
Forget it.

581
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:25,674
- Mister?
- Yes, honey.

582
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:28,541
Don't you say hi
to my friends.

583
00:46:28,677 --> 00:46:31,202
Oh... Sorry about that.

584
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:35,051
- Da-heui!
- Leave her alone.

585
00:46:35,051 --> 00:46:37,110
She's at the age.

586
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,758
I don't get to see you much
these days,

587
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:17,419
so I'll leave this here.

588
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:22,565
I want you to do
what you love doing best.

589
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:26,626
I love it when your sing.

590
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,637
You're daddy's number one girl.

591
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:33,838
To me, you're the best
in the world.

592
00:47:34,577 --> 00:47:36,704
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

593
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,723
Thank you.

594
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:17,910
Congrats!

595
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:25,018
I owe it all to you.
Congratulations.

596
00:48:25,761 --> 00:48:28,321
Is something
I can take credit for?

597
00:48:38,073 --> 00:48:39,335
You write, too?

598
00:48:39,975 --> 00:48:43,345
I've written tons of songs.

599
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:45,210
I didn't expect that.

600
00:48:46,448 --> 00:48:47,550
What do you mean?

601
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,313
You're an ex-girl group member.

602
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:50,918
What about that?

603
00:48:51,353 --> 00:48:53,821
Girl groups aren't supposed
to write music?

604
00:48:54,456 --> 00:48:56,358
What are you doing here still?

605
00:48:56,358 --> 00:48:59,020
That bastard producer is
keeping you...

606
00:48:59,962 --> 00:49:01,224
Oh, good afternoon.

607
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:04,933
I'II be at the car.

608
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:06,527
Hope you have a good afternoon.

609
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:15,701
Every single week,
he never skips once.

610
00:49:16,345 --> 00:49:17,312
A florist?

611
00:49:17,546 --> 00:49:21,312
Whoever he is,
he must be a scentful man.

612
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,717
You'd think, eh?

613
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:29,758
- Hi.
- Hey.

614
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,921
This is today's
guest info and story.

615
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:38,067
Make sure Jina reads it
before we start.

616
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:39,932
She picked this story herself.

617
00:49:44,873 --> 00:49:46,075
Hi, everyone!

618
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:47,076
- Hey!
- How are you?

619
00:49:47,076 --> 00:49:48,236
Hello...

620
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:56,714
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

621
00:50:06,061 --> 00:50:08,120
Listen to what?

622
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,624
Honey?

623
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:16,035
Da-heui just texted me
and told me to turn on the radio.

624
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:17,536
The radio?

625
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,545
"The Song I Sing to You"

626
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:28,751
We have a sweet highschool girl
in the studio today.

627
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:31,311
- Hi, there?
- Hi.

628
00:50:31,453 --> 00:50:34,456
My name is Yun Da-heui.

629
00:50:34,456 --> 00:50:37,118
I'm a junior at high school.

630
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:41,327
Would you Iike to tell us
your story and your song?

631
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,432
Dad, can you hear me?

632
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:52,329
I'm on the radio
that you used to adore.

633
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:56,805
You know
mom got remarried.

634
00:50:57,546 --> 00:51:00,413
To this ugly-Iooking man.

635
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,410
But,

636
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:08,021
he is real good to mom.

637
00:51:08,557 --> 00:51:16,931
Mom and I had it real hard
since you died.

638
00:51:19,268 --> 00:51:21,634
But that ugly man

639
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,340
who I really really hate

640
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:33,706
he says he is so happy
to have a daughter Iike me.

641
00:51:39,154 --> 00:51:42,715
If it's okay with you, dad,

642
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:50,125
I want to accept him as family.

643
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:56,932
I'm so sorry I've been a brat.

644
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:04,905
And thank you for the present...

645
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,508
Dad.

646
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:21,663
¢Ý I wish you knew
how I felt

647
00:52:21,663 --> 00:52:28,626
¢Ý even though
I couldn't come closer

648
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:36,407
¢Ý How much I wanted to

649
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:43,414
¢Ý my tears say it all

650
00:52:45,154 --> 00:52:52,561
¢Ý We loved each other
and loathed each other

651
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:59,729
¢Ý You cared for me more than anything
and I miss you so much

652
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:08,342
I never got close even
when you were with me

653
00:53:09,244 --> 00:53:16,116
¢Ý Oh did I hate you!

654
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:22,057
¢Ý Please hear me out
Hear my story

655
00:53:22,057 --> 00:53:28,519
¢Ý I need more time

656
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:38,231
¢Ý We loved each other
and loathed each other

657
00:53:38,474 --> 00:53:45,647
¢Ý You treasured me more than anything
and I miss you so much

658
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:54,021
¢Ý I never got it out of my chest

659
00:53:55,357 --> 00:54:05,926
¢Ý but, I really really loved you

660
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:20,408
You have a good eye
for picking stories.

661
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:26,221
I do what I can.

662
00:54:27,155 --> 00:54:30,420
I have a question for you.

663
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,828
What does this show
mean to you?

664
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:39,927
It's a space
where I tell my stories

665
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,934
Before, at Ieast.
Now it's different.

666
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:52,703
I Iisten to others' stories,
share the stories and console them.

667
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:56,411
and I end up getting consoled.

668
00:54:59,555 --> 00:55:01,216
I Iearn a Iot.

669
00:55:07,162 --> 00:55:09,926
I want to do music.

670
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:14,333
I feel as if I finally know
what I want to talk about.

671
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:17,739
Jina!

672
00:55:17,873 --> 00:55:20,776
- Oh, Jina! You won't believe this.
- Ouch! Hot!

673
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,177
You won't believe this.

674
00:55:22,177 --> 00:55:26,148
It's all over Youtube and
is taking over the internet.

675
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:29,709
Hello?
How have you been, Mr. Bae?

676
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:31,210
You'd Iike an interview?

677
00:55:35,757 --> 00:55:37,122
How Iong you been with her?

678
00:55:37,259 --> 00:55:39,022
- 3 days.
- 3 days?

679
00:55:39,261 --> 00:55:41,363
- Sounds Iike a serious stuff.
- Yeah, only 3 more days...

680
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:44,628
That's commitment.
I'm thrilled for you, man.

681
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:15,722
¢ÝYou're my angel, angel,
¢Ýangel to me.

682
00:56:15,864 --> 00:56:22,030
¢ÝI'll cherish your love
¢Ýforever and ever.

683
00:56:24,973 --> 00:56:29,307
¢ÝYou're perfect today
¢Ýlike you were yesterday.

684
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:33,704
¢ÝThere is nothing
¢Ýl want to ask of you.

685
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:37,009
This is all we got time
for this evening.

686
00:56:37,252 --> 00:56:39,855
It's a Iovely evening
with cool breeze.

687
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:43,723
How about some soju
and pork bone soup?

688
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:46,723
There is a song that comes
to my mind on a day Iike this.

689
00:56:46,962 --> 00:56:48,930
Lee Seung-hwan sings

690
00:56:51,767 --> 00:56:53,632
'Darkness and Star Lights'

691
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,635
It's a Kim Hyeon-sik Song

692
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,146
Lee Seung-hwan's warm voice
tugging at your heart string...

693
00:57:04,146 --> 00:57:06,148
Is there is a remake version
by Lee Seung-hwan?

694
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:11,553
We'II Iisten to this Iast song
and sign off for the night.

695
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,214
Hope you have a wonderful evening.

696
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:32,631
I hear Wonderful Radio
really hit it off.

697
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,245
As you heard,
Jae-hyeok did a great job.

698
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:41,909
Congratulations, bro.

699
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:44,815
What's going to happen
to our arrangement?

700
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:53,862
Come on,
you know how it works.

701
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:56,729
I can't pull down someone
who's doing well.

702
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:00,728
Listen, man.

703
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:03,872
I'm in the position
of asking you favors.

704
00:58:03,872 --> 00:58:08,900
But position can always change,
you know?

705
00:58:09,144 --> 00:58:12,204
You know how things work
in this business.

706
00:58:12,547 --> 00:58:17,917
If I drop Shin Jina now,
it'II only stir up gossips.

707
00:58:20,856 --> 00:58:28,319
¢ÝIt's not like I let her go.

708
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:33,427
Jae-hyeok,

709
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:37,036
who do you Iike best?
Kim Hyeon-sik or Kim Gwang-seok?

710
00:58:38,073 --> 00:58:39,540
Kim Gwang-seok.

711
00:58:39,674 --> 00:58:42,844
Then, Iet's play a game.
You name all the Kim Gwang-seok songs,

712
00:58:42,844 --> 00:58:45,747
and, I'II name Kim Hyeon-sik songs.
How about it?

713
00:58:45,747 --> 00:58:48,450
Forget it. You can't even get
'Like Rain Like Music' right.

714
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,052
Loser must do a favor
for the winner.

715
00:58:51,052 --> 00:58:52,713
Sounds fun!

716
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,458
'Like Rain Like Music'

717
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:57,859
I'm not playing.

718
00:58:57,859 --> 00:58:59,761
Ten, nine,

719
00:58:59,761 --> 00:59:00,462
- Eight,
- Eight...

720
00:59:00,462 --> 00:59:01,963
'I Loved You but'

721
00:59:01,963 --> 00:59:03,265
'Spring Summer Fall Winter'

722
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:04,425
'Around Thirty'

723
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,067
'Watercolor on a Rainy Day'

724
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:07,669
But, that's not his song.

725
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,331
He sang it with
Gang In-won and Gwon In-ha.

726
00:59:10,472 --> 00:59:11,473
She's right.

727
00:59:11,473 --> 00:59:13,134
AIright. Fine.

728
00:59:13,775 --> 00:59:15,436
'Story of an OId Couple'

729
00:59:15,644 --> 00:59:17,546
Wrong answer!
Learn your songs.

730
00:59:17,546 --> 00:59:21,650
The correct title is
'Story of an OId Couple in 60s'

731
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,652
- Hurrah.
- Yay, I won!

732
00:59:23,652 --> 00:59:27,956
- Wish! Wish!
- Wish! Wish!

733
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:29,357
Wish! Wish!

734
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,915
Wait a minute.

735
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,663
Swap over.
I'II do Kim Hyeon-sik.

736
00:59:34,663 --> 00:59:37,632
- Boo!
- Boo you. You Iost.

737
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,232
Is this your favorite restaurant?

738
00:59:40,468 --> 00:59:43,528
I guess.
I come here everyday.

739
00:59:44,973 --> 00:59:48,076
This Iiquor does wonders
for your health.

740
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:48,944
Thank you.

741
00:59:48,944 --> 00:59:52,747
Ma'am, the soup is amazing today!

742
00:59:52,747 --> 00:59:56,012
When wasn't it ever?

743
00:59:59,454 --> 01:00:03,413
You're a real handsome man.

744
01:00:04,659 --> 01:00:06,061
Uh... do you know me?

745
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,163
Of course! Mr. BCM.

746
01:00:08,163 --> 01:00:10,324
What are you doing, Mrs. Lee?

747
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:13,926
But you call him BCM.
Big-headed City Man, right?

748
01:00:16,771 --> 01:00:19,074
I forgot to make
the introduction.

749
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,576
This is Mrs. Lee,
the owner of this restaurant

750
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,101
and my mother.

751
01:00:28,049 --> 01:00:31,152
I Iisten to your show religiously.

752
01:00:31,152 --> 01:00:34,055
My Jina has a bit of a temper

753
01:00:34,055 --> 01:00:35,757
but in the core,
she is really an angel.

754
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:39,661
PIease guide her and treat her well.

755
01:00:39,661 --> 01:00:42,027
I don't have a temper.

756
01:00:42,163 --> 01:00:43,665
Shut up.

757
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:47,769
And I may be worrying for nothing,

758
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,930
- but I Iet me just say this.
- Yes, ma'am.

759
01:00:50,171 --> 01:00:54,876
I'm against office relationship.

760
01:00:54,876 --> 01:00:57,545
It might sound Iike
an oblivious bragging but

761
01:00:57,545 --> 01:01:00,248
she is so pretty and as her mother
it's only natural to worry...

762
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:01,750
Mom!

763
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,911
What! I almost shit my pants,
damn it!

764
01:01:04,853 --> 01:01:06,821
Oops... I'd better go.

765
01:01:09,758 --> 01:01:11,419
Careful.

766
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:18,223
- Make sure she gets homes.
- Sure.

767
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,435
She Iooks heavy.

768
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:23,735
He's a good man.

769
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,441
Oh, my head.

770
01:01:29,444 --> 01:01:30,809
This is a surprise.

771
01:01:31,246 --> 01:01:32,611
What is?

772
01:01:33,949 --> 01:01:35,109
I mean

773
01:01:36,751 --> 01:01:39,618
your Iooking after everyone.

774
01:01:40,455 --> 01:01:42,719
I always do.

775
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,161
I'm getting another drink!

776
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:48,220
- Hey!
- Calm down, darling.

777
01:01:53,868 --> 01:01:56,029
Take a seat
wherever you want.

778
01:02:00,976 --> 01:02:04,605
I didn't say my wish
from the game.

779
01:02:05,947 --> 01:02:07,107
Go on, then.

780
01:02:07,649 --> 01:02:10,812
A surprise present
for my birthday.

781
01:02:12,053 --> 01:02:13,418
When is your birthday?

782
01:02:22,063 --> 01:02:23,928
This will tell you.

783
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:27,931
I really Iike
your new segment.

784
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:35,139
I got the idea from mom.

785
01:02:35,643 --> 01:02:42,150
When I younger, my dad's fishing boat
went missing in Russian Sea.

786
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,711
Mom said
she Iike the word.

787
01:02:45,954 --> 01:02:47,216
'Missing'

788
01:02:47,856 --> 01:02:50,017
Not deceased by missing.

789
01:02:53,661 --> 01:02:59,031
So she always wears make-up
and we never moved house.

790
01:03:00,769 --> 01:03:04,672
My dad Ioved mom's singing.

791
01:03:04,672 --> 01:03:08,039
So, she always hums it.

792
01:03:09,844 --> 01:03:12,210
That's where I got the idea.

793
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:27,719
This is the first and Iast gift
that my dad ever got me.

794
01:03:28,363 --> 01:03:29,921
You know
what I wrote with it?

795
01:03:31,466 --> 01:03:32,831
What was it?

796
01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:37,229
My first song, 'You're My Angel.'

797
01:03:37,572 --> 01:03:39,437
It's a good song.

798
01:03:40,175 --> 01:03:42,507
You're actually paying complement?

799
01:03:43,244 --> 01:03:47,010
Your song has a story.

800
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,409
Oh, I'm a gal with stories.

801
01:03:54,355 --> 01:03:55,913
You don't write any more?

802
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:59,820
I can't.

803
01:04:02,063 --> 01:04:05,226
Something's missing here.

804
01:04:06,868 --> 01:04:08,836
Bottoms up!

805
01:04:10,271 --> 01:04:11,932
You poured a Iot more for me.

806
01:04:12,073 --> 01:04:13,233
Bottoms up.

807
01:04:17,745 --> 01:04:19,610
Man, it's strong.

808
01:04:21,749 --> 01:04:23,216
One more?

809
01:04:24,052 --> 01:04:25,917
Hey you!
Where are you going?

810
01:04:26,955 --> 01:04:29,321
- You talking to me?
- Walk straight.

811
01:04:29,457 --> 01:04:32,160
I'm not going anywhere.

812
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,526
I'm way past my Iimit.

813
01:04:34,863 --> 01:04:37,165
Two, three, four.

814
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,326
I'm feeling great.

815
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:44,172
I had drinks with a celebrity.

816
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:47,141
Where are we going now?

817
01:04:49,244 --> 01:04:51,146
I want more soju.

818
01:04:51,146 --> 01:04:55,550
Let's go that way.

819
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,152
Come on, celebrity.

820
01:04:57,152 --> 01:04:59,120
Come on!

821
01:05:17,672 --> 01:05:19,333
Go away.

822
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,206
Where are we?

823
01:05:24,145 --> 01:05:25,612
We're at a motel.

824
01:05:30,351 --> 01:05:33,013
You, fucking pervert!

825
01:05:33,154 --> 01:05:37,113
Is that why you tried so hard
to get me drunk?

826
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,661
Calm down, Nan-sol.

827
01:05:39,661 --> 01:05:42,564
Don't come up here,
you monster!

828
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:43,965
Hey, wait! Wait!

829
01:05:43,965 --> 01:05:46,668
You weren't...
really human Iast night.

830
01:05:46,668 --> 01:05:49,170
What?

831
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:52,373
Are you saying that we were
Iike animals here together, you and I?

832
01:05:52,373 --> 01:05:55,076
No no no no no.
That's not what I'm saying.

833
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,045
So, you don't remember.

834
01:05:57,045 --> 01:06:00,148
I was driving
and you were Iike...

835
01:06:00,148 --> 01:06:01,749
you were spitting at me.
Remember?

836
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,752
You were calling me names.
Said you weren't going home.

837
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,721
Then, you said you were transforming
and started taking off your clothes.

838
01:06:08,356 --> 01:06:13,861
Liar!
I would never do that!

839
01:06:13,861 --> 01:06:14,862
But I'm telling the truth.

840
01:06:14,862 --> 01:06:17,023
What have you got there?

841
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:22,170
Look at you!
In your boxers.

842
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,973
Where are your pants? Huh?

843
01:06:24,973 --> 01:06:25,873
What did you do to me?

844
01:06:25,873 --> 01:06:28,433
You threw up on my pants!

845
01:06:28,576 --> 01:06:31,646
It was gross.
I couldn't sleep because of that.

846
01:06:31,646 --> 01:06:35,550
Grossed me out.
I threw up washing my pants.

847
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,653
There are times
when nothing consols you.

848
01:06:38,653 --> 01:06:41,356
When the burden is too heavy.

849
01:06:41,356 --> 01:06:46,361
Wonderful Radio would Iike to be
your family, your friend and Iover.

850
01:06:46,361 --> 01:06:52,322
Cheer up, Mommy
We're always here for you

851
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:57,436
I Iove you darling dearly

852
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:19,918
Wait outside.

853
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,873
Contratulations! Your show is
the talk of the town.

854
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:34,075
Will we be hearing
your new album soon?

855
01:07:34,075 --> 01:07:37,845
I've been actually getting
some offers.

856
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,547
Then it won't be very far off.

857
01:07:39,547 --> 01:07:41,811
Hopefull not.

858
01:07:46,454 --> 01:07:47,921
What are you doing here?

859
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,222
We can only Iearn about Iove...

860
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:54,362
PIease keep this
a secret from Jina.

861
01:07:54,362 --> 01:08:00,130
Dae-geun,
we were meant for each other.

862
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:08,631
The Song I Sing to You
we have 13th guest on the show.

863
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,310
She is 29 years old

864
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:15,350
and describes herself
as umemployed wannabe musician.

865
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:18,615
Shall we hear her story?

866
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:25,520
This song I'm singing today
is dedicated to you, Miss Shin.

867
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:30,720
To me? What a great honor.
Thank you!

868
01:08:31,265 --> 01:08:35,069
I'II tell my story
through this song.

869
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:38,038
A round of applause for her?

870
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:47,208
¢ÝWhy do moments of crisis
¢Ýpass so slowly?

871
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:55,212
¢ÝWhy is time of endurance
¢Ýalways so long?

872
01:08:55,356 --> 01:09:01,420
¢ÝAm I getting over it
¢Ýor just getting used to it?

873
01:09:01,963 --> 01:09:09,131
¢ÝWhat's at the end
¢Ýof all this wandering?

874
01:09:10,571 --> 01:09:16,806
Someone is posting
a Youtube Iink on our website.

875
01:09:18,646 --> 01:09:21,549
¢ÝMake you stronger

876
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:23,813
If this was written in 2002,

877
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:29,483
¢ÝMake yourself stronger

878
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:33,127
No... It can't be.

879
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:38,227
¢ÝNever change

880
01:09:40,768 --> 01:09:44,932
You recognize this melody,
don't you?

881
01:09:45,273 --> 01:09:50,044
This is the song called "Island"
which I wrote and released back in 2002.

882
01:09:50,044 --> 01:09:53,207
I was approached about an album deal
but it fell through.

883
01:09:55,049 --> 01:09:57,351
Because the hottest girl band
at the time, Purple

884
01:09:57,351 --> 01:09:59,911
released a song
with the same melody.

885
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:07,962
But, I wrote this song.

886
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:10,765
You must be mistaken.
Don't get heated up

887
01:10:10,765 --> 01:10:12,130
I'm mistaken?

888
01:10:13,067 --> 01:10:17,936
I came here to get my song back.
Just close up the song

889
01:10:18,573 --> 01:10:23,909
The song that you stole from me.

890
01:10:24,245 --> 01:10:27,305
Can you vouch
for your accusation?

891
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:33,855
How can you prove
that this song is yours?

892
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:36,016
The footage of me performing it.

893
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,917
And the song I just sang.

894
01:10:40,561 --> 01:10:42,426
What more do you need?

895
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:46,231
You're My Angel?
Purple?

896
01:10:48,469 --> 01:10:49,871
My ass...

897
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:52,373
You fucking psycho!

898
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,774
Turn off the mic! Now!

899
01:10:53,774 --> 01:10:55,176
What are you saying?

900
01:10:55,176 --> 01:10:55,843
- Jina, calm down.
- Jina.

901
01:10:55,843 --> 01:10:57,245
- You want me to say it?
- Jina, please.

902
01:10:57,245 --> 01:10:59,547
You're telling a Iie on-air.

903
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:00,448
- Calm down, Jina.
- Jina.

904
01:11:00,448 --> 01:11:02,006
PIease calm down.

905
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,723
Jina, what happened in there?

906
01:11:17,665 --> 01:11:21,469
You cursed and blurted out
on a Iive show.

907
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:25,773
Am I supposed to say nothing?
She accused me of plagiarism.

908
01:11:25,773 --> 01:11:29,504
Footages with dates are
being posted on our website.

909
01:11:30,344 --> 01:11:31,811
How do you explain that?

910
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:37,417
You're Iike the rest of them.

911
01:11:40,454 --> 01:11:45,517
You don't believe me, do you?

912
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,722
I gotta go.

913
01:11:48,963 --> 01:11:50,123
Jina!

914
01:11:54,168 --> 01:11:59,173
You should have shut down
the mic and played music.

915
01:11:59,173 --> 01:12:00,731
What's going to happen to Jina?

916
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:02,399
You're asking me?

917
01:12:02,743 --> 01:12:05,346
She's axed forever!

918
01:12:05,346 --> 01:12:07,348
She must be given a chance
to explain herself.

919
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:09,816
Explain what?

920
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:14,655
PIagiarism is a secondary issue.
She acted irresponsibly on the Iive show.

921
01:12:14,655 --> 01:12:20,025
What did I tell you?
We should've changed her.

922
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:23,821
Mira would have never
made a mistake Iike that.

923
01:12:24,665 --> 01:12:28,032
Since you mention it,

924
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:31,272
will it be possible for Mira to fill in?

925
01:12:31,272 --> 01:12:33,536
Come on, bro.

926
01:12:33,774 --> 01:12:36,844
That makes Mira a stand-in.

927
01:12:36,844 --> 01:12:39,046
You're not making sense.

928
01:12:39,046 --> 01:12:43,005
That's why I came to you.
I'm asking you a favor.

929
01:12:48,255 --> 01:12:52,360
Only because you're asking.

930
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,021
Thanks, man.

931
01:12:54,362 --> 01:12:57,627
When will I ever benefit from you?

932
01:12:57,865 --> 01:12:59,332
It's tricky.

933
01:13:01,369 --> 01:13:03,837
Plagiarism, cursing on-air
Shin is falling from grace once again

934
01:13:22,056 --> 01:13:23,614
Hi, In-yeong.

935
01:13:24,558 --> 01:13:27,527
Are you alright, sweetie?

936
01:13:28,963 --> 01:13:36,671
Are you home alone?
I'll come over.

937
01:13:36,671 --> 01:13:41,335
I'm okay.
What are you worrying about?

938
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:47,906
You are not keeping quiet
because of me. Are you?

939
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:50,451
I'm really okay.

940
01:13:50,451 --> 01:13:54,319
I don't care
what people think about my past.

941
01:13:54,555 --> 01:14:01,062
So, just think only about yourself.
Okay?

942
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,825
I know. I gotta go.

943
01:14:03,764 --> 01:14:06,130
Jina!

944
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:15,843
What flows faster than time?

945
01:14:15,843 --> 01:14:19,301
It's been almost 1 month
since I joined.

946
01:14:19,847 --> 01:14:22,850
You feel Iike family to me now.

947
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:24,613
How do you feel?

948
01:14:25,052 --> 01:14:27,816
Let me play
one of favorite songs.

949
01:14:28,155 --> 01:14:31,818
Lee Seung-cheol sings
'Super Hero'

950
01:14:35,963 --> 01:14:37,123
How did I do?

951
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:47,475
It's a Lee Seung-hwan song.
Make a correction after the song.

952
01:14:47,475 --> 01:14:51,045
Did I? I'm sorry.
I'II make a correction.

953
01:14:51,045 --> 01:14:55,914
Shall we get some sushi
after the show? I'II buy.

954
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,917
- Maybe some other time.
- Promise?

955
01:15:00,254 --> 01:15:02,356
Heard any news about Jina?

956
01:15:02,356 --> 01:15:04,759
Nothing at all.

957
01:15:04,759 --> 01:15:08,820
I doubt she'II ever
be able to come back.

958
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:20,131
Did you know that this team
faced a crisis once?

959
01:15:20,674 --> 01:15:23,644
We were doing really well

960
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:27,011
and the director was going to get
bigger producers and writers for the show.

961
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:29,912
And you know what Jina did?

962
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:31,752
She confronted him

963
01:15:31,752 --> 01:15:35,916
saying if he was ignoning the hardwork
of everyone who made this show happen.

964
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:39,918
It must have been shocking.

965
01:15:41,862 --> 01:15:46,822
What good is all that
when she can't Iook after herself?

966
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,332
¢ÝWhat's at the end?

967
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:23,370
Excuse me.
Is Mr. Cho still in a meeting?

968
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,930
I have an appointment at two.

969
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:29,399
One moment, please.

970
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:37,151
Mr. Cho,
Ms Shin Jina is still waiting...

971
01:16:37,151 --> 01:16:38,709
Yes, sir.

972
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:46,560
Lingering memory slowly...

973
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,427
That's enough. Thanks.

974
01:16:50,464 --> 01:16:52,266
It doesn't move me.
At all.

975
01:16:52,266 --> 01:16:59,035
I'II give my everything
Iike this is the first time.

976
01:16:59,173 --> 01:17:01,075
If you only believe in me...

977
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:03,944
You don't have that feeling

978
01:17:03,944 --> 01:17:08,210
from the days as Purple.

979
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:10,713
Let's not have this conversation.

980
01:17:13,654 --> 01:17:19,115
Anyway...
Are you sure you wrote this song?

981
01:17:25,165 --> 01:17:27,268
Infinity is the Iaw.

982
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:28,969
Forget Infinity.
Beast is the best.

983
01:17:28,969 --> 01:17:30,571
- Infinity rules.
- No, Beast.

984
01:17:30,571 --> 01:17:32,373
Isn't that Shin Jina over there?

985
01:17:32,373 --> 01:17:36,002
The plagiarist?

986
01:17:37,244 --> 01:17:39,847
- Did you watch Entertainment Now?
- No.

987
01:17:39,847 --> 01:17:44,716
She was acting as if she was all that.
Look at her now.

988
01:17:45,552 --> 01:17:51,218
You can't guess
what they are capable.

989
01:17:51,558 --> 01:17:54,261
Oh my gosh, did you hear her
go berserk on radio?

990
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:54,762
No.

991
01:17:54,762 --> 01:17:59,028
It was a total disaster.

992
01:18:01,368 --> 01:18:03,771
Look at her holding her guitar.
So she is still a musician, huh?

993
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:05,973
Come on, she might hear us.
Let's get out of here.

994
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,531
Let's go.

995
01:19:21,849 --> 01:19:23,612
There is no gig today?

996
01:19:23,951 --> 01:19:26,613
No.

997
01:19:27,254 --> 01:19:33,921
Business is slow.
I can't afford Iive bands.

998
01:19:35,162 --> 01:19:36,720
Are you a musician?

999
01:19:36,964 --> 01:19:41,731
No, I was just thinking about someone
who played here 10 years ago.

1000
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:46,073
That can't be.
We've been only open for 4 years.

1001
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:49,008
- There was an internet shop before.
- What?

1002
01:19:49,643 --> 01:19:50,701
Look.

1003
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:58,816
I want to move my beauty shop.

1004
01:19:59,853 --> 01:20:01,655
But you only just changed.

1005
01:20:01,655 --> 01:20:04,158
They keep making me wait.

1006
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:06,922
Then you should cut in.

1007
01:20:07,961 --> 01:20:11,165
I'm in a tight spot.

1008
01:20:11,165 --> 01:20:14,068
People keep asking me
when my next song is coming out.

1009
01:20:14,068 --> 01:20:15,330
Your song?

1010
01:20:15,569 --> 01:20:19,373
I got that arranged
with a composer.

1011
01:20:19,373 --> 01:20:22,443
He will write something that
you can publish under your name.

1012
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,808
- Really?
- Of course.

1013
01:20:26,547 --> 01:20:27,648
He is in a meeting now.

1014
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,950
Look what we have here.

1015
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,008
You can't barge in here Iike this.

1016
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:34,955
What brought you here?

1017
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,217
So...

1018
01:20:38,258 --> 01:20:40,961
- 10 years ago, was it?
- Pardon me?

1019
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:44,226
You said you performed "Island"
back in 2002.

1020
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,933
That's right. Why?

1021
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:53,532
You played a gig in 2002
in a bar that opened in 2007.

1022
01:20:54,274 --> 01:20:57,505
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

1023
01:20:57,845 --> 01:21:00,447
Barging in on me Iike this?

1024
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:04,008
How can you have staged this?

1025
01:21:05,752 --> 01:21:08,016
Because of a scumbag Iike you,

1026
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:11,058
there is no room for people
who Iove radio!

1027
01:21:11,058 --> 01:21:13,961
Scumbag? Since when
were we on such informal terms?

1028
01:21:13,961 --> 01:21:16,225
Put Shin Jina back
in her place.

1029
01:21:19,466 --> 01:21:22,333
Hey, you!

1030
01:21:25,272 --> 01:21:29,106
- Come on. Let's get you home.
- Bro, you just don't understand me.

1031
01:21:31,245 --> 01:21:32,109
Go to sleep!

1032
01:21:33,447 --> 01:21:36,450
Sorry about
my buddy and the fuss.

1033
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:39,817
He seems upset about something.

1034
01:21:40,954 --> 01:21:43,056
Shall I play something cheerful?

1035
01:21:43,056 --> 01:21:44,921
Be my guest.

1036
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:55,426
What is this song?
Wasn't it a massive hit?

1037
01:21:55,769 --> 01:21:57,634
- Do you want some clues?
- Sure.

1038
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:59,429
The first of the firsts.

1039
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:01,775
Fairies forever.

1040
01:22:01,775 --> 01:22:04,403
The beginning of the girl group
and the end.

1041
01:22:04,745 --> 01:22:07,305
- It's Purple!
- Purple!

1042
01:22:07,848 --> 01:22:10,450
Purple! Purple!
I remember.

1043
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:11,952
You remember
because you're an artist.

1044
01:22:11,952 --> 01:22:14,716
I remember the dance.

1045
01:22:14,855 --> 01:22:17,658
I used to know
the entire routine.

1046
01:22:17,658 --> 01:22:19,626
- I know that dance, too.
- Go back to sleep!

1047
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:23,223
It's good, huh?

1048
01:22:23,363 --> 01:22:24,665
This is a great evening.

1049
01:22:24,665 --> 01:22:28,226
Shall I take you
for a drive around the town?

1050
01:22:28,869 --> 01:22:30,029
Just go home.

1051
01:22:33,273 --> 01:22:34,240
Yes, sir.

1052
01:22:57,864 --> 01:23:00,332
- Mom.
- What do you want?

1053
01:23:01,068 --> 01:23:03,434
You need help with anything?

1054
01:23:03,971 --> 01:23:07,774
Well, that's a first?

1055
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,208
I was being nice, okay?

1056
01:23:10,644 --> 01:23:12,202
How's work going?

1057
01:23:13,347 --> 01:23:17,215
Not well.

1058
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:18,652
- Mom.
- Huh?

1059
01:23:18,652 --> 01:23:21,621
Shall we have a drink?

1060
01:23:22,155 --> 01:23:23,713
What's gotten into you?

1061
01:23:23,857 --> 01:23:26,325
Coming up with
such a brilliant idea?

1062
01:23:27,361 --> 01:23:28,521
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1063
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:39,427
You should always eat something
with your drinks.

1064
01:23:40,874 --> 01:23:44,503
You get that from your dad.

1065
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:50,015
How is that producer of yours doing?
You didn't hear from him?

1066
01:23:51,051 --> 01:23:54,509
It's good that he never calls.
We only used to fight all the time.

1067
01:23:54,955 --> 01:23:58,220
Oh come on.

1068
01:23:58,558 --> 01:24:02,362
We never got along.

1069
01:24:02,362 --> 01:24:05,024
You are a spitting image of your dad.

1070
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,533
You still think about him?

1071
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:12,732
Sometimes.

1072
01:24:13,573 --> 01:24:15,598
Still wait for him?

1073
01:24:16,743 --> 01:24:21,648
When he comes back,

1074
01:24:21,648 --> 01:24:26,053
I wanted to show him
what a great job I did raising you.

1075
01:24:26,053 --> 01:24:27,418
Mom...

1076
01:24:27,554 --> 01:24:30,022
Don't worry about me.
I'm okay.

1077
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:34,621
Believe me, darling.

1078
01:24:35,762 --> 01:24:38,026
I believe you.

1079
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:47,639
Feel like crying tonight

1080
01:24:51,144 --> 01:24:59,415
Our love sways
over the river of time

1081
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:06,925
with my tears

1082
01:25:09,863 --> 01:25:18,532
How long should I go on for...

1083
01:25:28,648 --> 01:25:32,209
Wonderful Radio DJ
Jina's Birthday!

1084
01:25:39,559 --> 01:25:45,122
You could have called me
to Iet me know.

1085
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:50,828
With the recent scandals,

1086
01:25:51,471 --> 01:25:55,430
patients' guardians complainted
that it's bad for the children

1087
01:25:58,044 --> 01:26:02,708
The incident on Iive show
and plagiarism scandal, you know.

1088
01:26:17,063 --> 01:26:18,530
I asked your mother.

1089
01:26:18,765 --> 01:26:22,223
She wouldn't tell
but I insisted.

1090
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:26,935
I guss I only Iooked at it
from my perspective.

1091
01:26:28,175 --> 01:26:30,507
I should have stood by you.

1092
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:35,307
I'm sorry.

1093
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:43,021
Don't worry about it.
I'm okay, now.

1094
01:26:43,857 --> 01:26:48,123
Not being able to do the show
and not being to able to sing.

1095
01:26:49,463 --> 01:26:52,227
I don't blame it on anyone.

1096
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:00,335
You should sing.
I came to tell you that.

1097
01:27:02,442 --> 01:27:08,403
You said you finally know
what you want to sing about.

1098
01:27:11,151 --> 01:27:12,516
Let's sing.

1099
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:33,273
You were the producer?

1100
01:27:33,273 --> 01:27:35,642
Well, it's not confirmed yet.

1101
01:27:35,642 --> 01:27:37,844
It doesn't feel right
in my heart.

1102
01:27:37,844 --> 01:27:40,711
I haven't had the chance
to prepare myself.

1103
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:42,207
You got it for me!

1104
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:47,354
Free stuff always
brings me peace.

1105
01:27:47,354 --> 01:27:52,121
Shin Jina, welcome to my world.
This is Dream Factory.

1106
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:01,227
Let's start.

1107
01:28:01,368 --> 01:28:03,734
One two three four.

1108
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:14,002
¢ÝLingering memories
¢Ýcome back to me

1109
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:20,513
¢ÝYou come back to me

1110
01:28:21,955 --> 01:28:27,723
¢Ýalthough I left you,
¢Ýforgot about you

1111
01:28:28,361 --> 01:28:32,666
¢Ýl poured out my heart

1112
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:35,969
¢Ýto love you, to hurt you

1113
01:28:35,969 --> 01:28:40,929
¢Ýand to love you again

1114
01:28:41,575 --> 01:28:45,545
¢ÝIt's so bitter the memory

1115
01:28:45,545 --> 01:28:50,812
¢ÝSo bitter because I remember

1116
01:28:51,084 --> 01:28:53,746
¢Ýbecause I miss it

1117
01:28:54,354 --> 01:28:58,458
¢Ýl poured out my heart

1118
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,761
¢Ýto love you, to hurt you

1119
01:29:01,761 --> 01:29:06,926
¢Ýto love you again

1120
01:29:07,367 --> 01:29:11,471
¢ÝIt's so bitter the memory

1121
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:16,306
¢ÝSo bitter because I remember

1122
01:29:16,743 --> 01:29:19,803
¢Ýbecause I miss it

1123
01:29:21,548 --> 01:29:23,750
I apologize sincerely.

1124
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,809
Rumy is all taken care of?

1125
01:29:27,354 --> 01:29:30,357
I arranged for her to Ieave
the country for a few months.

1126
01:29:30,357 --> 01:29:34,123
I thought I could kickstart
my debut ifl raise issues.

1127
01:29:34,561 --> 01:29:40,124
Do your job right.

1128
01:29:42,068 --> 01:29:43,330
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I did...

1129
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:47,431
- Get outta here.
- everything single-handedly

1130
01:29:48,942 --> 01:29:54,903
and my label had nothing
to do with it.

1131
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:59,114
You got tons of trashy music
in your office.

1132
01:30:00,253 --> 01:30:06,159
Nice and stuffy in here.

1133
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:07,360
Juts cut to the chase.

1134
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,625
What's wrong with you?

1135
01:30:11,965 --> 01:30:17,232
I Iearned a Iot
from your Iast visit.

1136
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:20,134
I'm only trying to help you.

1137
01:30:22,742 --> 01:30:27,406
He's talking about the special show
commemorating 1000th show.

1138
01:30:27,647 --> 01:30:30,707
TV, It'II be aired Iive
on radio and TV.

1139
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:33,410
We'II fill up the Iineup
with Lee's boys and girls.

1140
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,361
That's a great idea.

1141
01:30:41,361 --> 01:30:44,464
but I'II come up
with the final Iineup.

1142
01:30:44,464 --> 01:30:47,767
Of course, you won't need to worry
about your boys and girls.

1143
01:30:47,767 --> 01:30:51,533
Well, you're the producer in charge.

1144
01:30:51,671 --> 01:30:56,699
It Iooks Iike you have
something up your sleeve.

1145
01:30:56,843 --> 01:30:58,208
It's Shin Jina.

1146
01:30:59,145 --> 01:31:03,013
Her name is cleared but...

1147
01:31:03,349 --> 01:31:04,651
isn't it too early
to make a come back?

1148
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:07,654
I'II present you
with a preliminary Iineup.

1149
01:31:07,654 --> 01:31:10,020
Jae-hyeok! Jae-hyeok!

1150
01:31:17,664 --> 01:31:18,926
Wait.

1151
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:29,306
You think it would hurt the station
more to Iose one good producer

1152
01:31:30,543 --> 01:31:39,713
or an entire army of their
most popular hosts and DJs?

1153
01:31:41,254 --> 01:31:45,315
Are you threatening me?

1154
01:31:49,562 --> 01:31:51,120
I think so.

1155
01:32:00,673 --> 01:32:02,197
Put Shin Jina on the Iineup.

1156
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:05,906
And hang this on the Iine, too.

1157
01:32:15,855 --> 01:32:19,120
- Give me my cellphone?
- Here.

1158
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,661
Where is Yong-sik?

1159
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,629
He had a call from Mr. Lee.

1160
01:32:23,763 --> 01:32:26,065
He didn't update me
on the afternoon schedule.

1161
01:32:26,065 --> 01:32:27,867
He'II be right back.

1162
01:32:27,867 --> 01:32:33,032
How have you been, Mira?

1163
01:32:37,043 --> 01:32:40,501
What are you doing here?

1164
01:32:42,148 --> 01:32:45,652
You know the rumor
about my time in juvie.

1165
01:32:45,652 --> 01:32:47,119
I don't want to hear about it.

1166
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:49,014
Well, it's not a rumor.

1167
01:32:49,956 --> 01:32:53,119
When I was in 13
I came back from school

1168
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,523
and my step father was beating
the hell out of mom again.

1169
01:33:00,066 --> 01:33:02,330
I had to stop him somehow.

1170
01:33:03,069 --> 01:33:11,204
And I realized
I had killed a man.

1171
01:33:12,946 --> 01:33:18,612
On the night before our Iast concert,
a reporter told me he'd run the story.

1172
01:33:21,454 --> 01:33:23,115
Jina said...

1173
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:28,721
That we can stop it
if we break up the group.

1174
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:34,431
Jina said she couldn't watch me
branded a murderer

1175
01:33:35,368 --> 01:33:37,131
for the rest of my Iife.

1176
01:33:40,273 --> 01:33:42,605
Why are you telling me this now?

1177
01:33:43,142 --> 01:33:46,908
I don't care. I gotta go.

1178
01:33:47,547 --> 01:33:53,611
PIease don't hate her
so much.

1179
01:33:54,053 --> 01:33:55,611
I said I wasn't interested.

1180
01:34:05,565 --> 01:34:06,827
Your autographs, please?

1181
01:34:19,145 --> 01:34:22,048
This is Shin Jina's
historical comeback album.

1182
01:34:22,048 --> 01:34:23,606
Cherish it as a treasure.

1183
01:34:26,052 --> 01:34:28,919
About the comeback broadcast
that I mentioned earlier.

1184
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:32,617
I'm not performing
on TV or radio.

1185
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,127
Wonderful Radio's 1000th
special broadcast is coming up.

1186
01:34:37,764 --> 01:34:41,029
I want that to be
your comeback stage.

1187
01:34:42,268 --> 01:34:43,929
I don't think I can do it.

1188
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:49,601
Why?
You brought the show this far.

1189
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:53,306
I would really Iike you
to be part of the show.

1190
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:58,811
I'm making an official request
as the producer of the show.

1191
01:35:00,053 --> 01:35:01,111
PIease.

1192
01:35:02,455 --> 01:35:06,915
And, this is my present.
Open it when you get home.

1193
01:35:08,861 --> 01:35:10,726
Shin Jina, the recording artist!

1194
01:35:12,265 --> 01:35:13,967
I have a Iittle something
for you, too.

1195
01:35:13,967 --> 01:35:15,127
Hey, that's uh...

1196
01:35:15,568 --> 01:35:17,570
Don't flex your muscles on me.

1197
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:19,231
- Come on, man.
- There you go.

1198
01:35:20,974 --> 01:35:22,075
That's okay.

1199
01:35:22,075 --> 01:35:23,508
Come on.

1200
01:35:43,963 --> 01:35:46,165
But I can't do it.

1201
01:35:46,165 --> 01:35:48,267
What's the matter?
You promised me.

1202
01:35:48,267 --> 01:35:50,670
- But, bro...
- Stop being a sissy.

1203
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:51,830
This doesn't feel right.

1204
01:35:53,673 --> 01:35:55,140
Wait. Wait!

1205
01:35:57,844 --> 01:36:03,407
¢ÝLove comes to you quietly

1206
01:36:05,251 --> 01:36:10,712
¢Ýand makes your heart pound

1207
01:36:12,258 --> 01:36:17,821
¢ÝThe voice that I could no longer hear

1208
01:36:19,265 --> 01:36:22,368
¢Ýl miss your voice so much

1209
01:36:22,368 --> 01:36:24,734
I really can't do it.

1210
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:30,043
- Will she Iike it?
- Believe me.

1211
01:36:30,043 --> 01:36:32,745
Moment's embarrassment
guarantees Iifetime of Iove.

1212
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,804
Let's go.

1213
01:36:39,852 --> 01:36:42,320
Man, do I really need to do this?

1214
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:44,557
You promised.

1215
01:36:44,557 --> 01:36:47,060
- Come on, man.
- What's wrong with you, man?

1216
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:48,322
I'II revenge you.

1217
01:36:48,461 --> 01:36:50,163
You know I can't sing.

1218
01:36:50,163 --> 01:36:52,131
Will you stop crying
Iike a Iittle girl?

1219
01:37:21,661 --> 01:37:23,822
How about 'Thank you'?
Where is your manner?

1220
01:37:25,765 --> 01:37:27,166
- Little brats...
- Hey!

1221
01:37:27,166 --> 01:37:29,327
Stop playing that crappy song.

1222
01:37:29,569 --> 01:37:32,171
Don't you know
whose song this is?

1223
01:37:32,171 --> 01:37:33,536
Whose is it?

1224
01:37:34,073 --> 01:37:36,803
How do I explain this?

1225
01:37:37,243 --> 01:37:39,404
First of the firsts.

1226
01:37:39,545 --> 01:37:41,147
The beginning
of the girl band syndrome.

1227
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:42,205
And the end.

1228
01:37:43,249 --> 01:37:46,352
Eternal fairies.
They don't even age that much.

1229
01:37:46,352 --> 01:37:47,614
This the masterpiece of Purple,

1230
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:56,822
'You are My Angel'

1231
01:37:58,364 --> 01:38:00,525
Let's get going, man.

1232
01:38:09,942 --> 01:38:12,809
Hello? Hi!

1233
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:18,117
Pardon?

1234
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:31,464
We Iove you, Jina.

1235
01:38:31,464 --> 01:38:34,467
Shin Jina!

1236
01:38:34,467 --> 01:38:36,628
You're the truth, Jina

1237
01:39:13,172 --> 01:39:17,043
I saw the cue sheet.
You really have to push forward?

1238
01:39:17,043 --> 01:39:22,208
Don't you know what Lee is Iike?
You'II end up hurt.

1239
01:39:25,851 --> 01:39:31,619
I'm going to make the show
that I want.

1240
01:39:38,664 --> 01:39:39,722
I'm sorry.

1241
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:46,834
- Jina!
- Oh, Jina!

1242
01:39:50,643 --> 01:39:53,746
- I missed you so much.
- How are you?

1243
01:39:53,746 --> 01:39:55,213
You Iook good.

1244
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,550
Good job with the preparation.

1245
01:39:57,550 --> 01:40:00,713
It's been so hard
since you Ieft.

1246
01:40:04,557 --> 01:40:08,220
Come on, Mira.
They want you inside.

1247
01:40:15,268 --> 01:40:17,031
Where did you get this?

1248
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:20,038
In the waiting room.

1249
01:40:20,573 --> 01:40:24,703
What difference is it going to make?
She's finished.

1250
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:45,021
Is really performing
on the show tonight?

1251
01:40:45,865 --> 01:40:49,528
Mr. Lee will flip out.

1252
01:40:58,444 --> 01:41:00,846
- It's me.
- Hey, darling.

1253
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:03,508
- I'm going in now.
- You arrived early.

1254
01:41:03,649 --> 01:41:07,653
- Listen.
- What is it, honey?

1255
01:41:07,653 --> 01:41:10,156
About Jina performing tonight.

1256
01:41:10,156 --> 01:41:13,819
Don't worry about it.
It's all taken care of.

1257
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:16,324
No, actually...

1258
01:41:16,762 --> 01:41:17,763
Then what?

1259
01:41:17,763 --> 01:41:22,268
I don't care
whether she performs on stage.

1260
01:41:22,268 --> 01:41:25,829
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly.

1261
01:41:26,072 --> 01:41:27,973
And this doesn't just concern you.

1262
01:41:27,973 --> 01:41:30,042
This is about my pride.

1263
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:34,647
Even if Jina comes to the show,
she'll not singing on that stage. Okay?

1264
01:41:34,647 --> 01:41:36,449
In-seok! Wait.

1265
01:41:36,449 --> 01:41:39,213
Come on, we gotta go.

1266
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:48,217
- Did you check the artists?
- Yes.

1267
01:41:48,761 --> 01:41:51,229
Do you know
that Jina is here?

1268
01:41:53,165 --> 01:41:57,625
If you're happy and
you know it, smile, man.

1269
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:01,034
- Last commercial.
- Okay.

1270
01:42:04,143 --> 01:42:06,611
One, two, go.

1271
01:42:15,154 --> 01:42:16,121
Hi everyone,

1272
01:42:16,255 --> 01:42:20,359
Wonderful Radio is celebrating
its 1000th show tonight.

1273
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:23,963
Thank you all for coming here to celebrate
with us this special moment.

1274
01:42:23,963 --> 01:42:26,565
Here with us tonight,
we have guests

1275
01:42:26,565 --> 01:42:30,023
from "The Song I Sing to You"

1276
01:42:30,469 --> 01:42:33,529
Lim Seul-gi! Lim Seul-gi!

1277
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:38,043
Wonderful Radio and wonderful Iife

1278
01:42:38,043 --> 01:42:40,307
starts now.

1279
01:43:35,067 --> 01:43:36,728
I heard you released
a new album.

1280
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:39,872
I should have sent you a congratulatory
tweet or something

1281
01:43:39,872 --> 01:43:41,931
but I've been too busy.

1282
01:43:42,241 --> 01:43:44,343
Can you make it quick?

1283
01:43:44,343 --> 01:43:46,245
I need to prepare
for my performance.

1284
01:43:46,245 --> 01:43:47,803
What's the hurry?

1285
01:43:50,749 --> 01:43:52,910
When Purple split up,

1286
01:43:53,752 --> 01:43:57,518
I should have kept to you
no matter what.

1287
01:43:58,657 --> 01:44:02,616
Mira is perfect
except for the guts

1288
01:44:03,662 --> 01:44:05,323
which you have.

1289
01:44:07,066 --> 01:44:11,670
In this business, you need the guts to go
on stage even at the cost of your producer.

1290
01:44:11,670 --> 01:44:13,831
Mira Iacks that quality.

1291
01:44:14,874 --> 01:44:20,904
What did you say?
Whose neck is on the Iine?

1292
01:44:23,349 --> 01:44:25,214
Your producer, Lee Jae-hyeok.

1293
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:26,818
Jina!

1294
01:44:30,856 --> 01:44:35,623
You have a very tall friend.
I'II Iook forward to your show.

1295
01:44:42,768 --> 01:44:51,904
¢Ý I rememberyour face
from when you first came to me

1296
01:44:52,645 --> 01:45:02,111
¢Ý You touched my heart
and it stood broken since

1297
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:10,162
Jae-hyeok, it's Jina!

1298
01:45:10,162 --> 01:45:13,165
Hurry!
Come on, now.

1299
01:45:13,165 --> 01:45:15,429
What about her?

1300
01:45:26,545 --> 01:45:29,810
Tell me what happened?

1301
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:33,612
Why didn't you tell me
what was at stake on this show?

1302
01:45:34,053 --> 01:45:37,113
Did you think about
how I would feel?

1303
01:45:37,957 --> 01:45:39,720
I can't play this gig.

1304
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,525
Are you running away?

1305
01:45:47,866 --> 01:45:51,131
Don't you think about everyone
in the audience who is waiting for you?

1306
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:55,329
There are people supporting you
waiting for your song.

1307
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:59,201
Breaking up of the band,
PIagiarism scandal...

1308
01:46:01,547 --> 01:46:05,210
You think you can only help others
by sacrificing yourself?

1309
01:46:16,762 --> 01:46:17,922
Sing.

1310
01:46:19,365 --> 01:46:20,832
For yourself.

1311
01:46:21,367 --> 01:46:25,133
And for me.

1312
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:42,554
¢Ý I'll love you always

1313
01:46:42,554 --> 01:46:48,160
¢Ý I'll love you like this moment

1314
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:52,927
¢Ý More than anyone in the world

1315
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:13,516
Hi, mom.

1316
01:47:13,652 --> 01:47:16,314
Did you eat?

1317
01:47:18,257 --> 01:47:19,558
Not yet.

1318
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:23,016
You gotta eat
ifyou're gonna sing.

1319
01:47:23,962 --> 01:47:29,268
I'll be listening to you
from here with daddy.

1320
01:47:29,268 --> 01:47:32,931
So, don't be too nervous.
Just do your thing, okay?

1321
01:47:34,873 --> 01:47:37,398
Answer me, silly girl!

1322
01:47:38,644 --> 01:47:44,105
Come home and have beer
with me later, okay?

1323
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:47,553
Sure.
- What?

1324
01:47:47,553 --> 01:47:50,420
- I said 'Okay'!
- Go, my girl!

1325
01:48:04,069 --> 01:48:10,943
¢Ýl only kept in my heart

1326
01:48:10,943 --> 01:48:12,103
Mira, you ready?

1327
01:48:13,645 --> 01:48:23,816
¢ÝYes, I loved you

1328
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:34,330
We'II have the Iast guest of part.

1329
01:48:39,371 --> 01:48:42,807
We can't talk about Wonderful Radio
without mentioning this person.

1330
01:48:43,242 --> 01:48:48,805
She was with you from the very
first show till not Iong ago.

1331
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:13,638
Jina!

1332
01:49:19,344 --> 01:49:22,507
At the heart of Wonderful Radio

1333
01:49:22,648 --> 01:49:24,550
and the former Ieader of Purple,

1334
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:27,713
Give it up for Shin Jina!

1335
01:49:42,768 --> 01:49:49,503
Hi everyone! It's so great to see you
again on Wonderful Radio.

1336
01:49:49,641 --> 01:49:51,506
I'm Shin Jina.

1337
01:49:58,951 --> 01:50:02,910
While I was in Purple and
presenting Wonderful Radio

1338
01:50:03,655 --> 01:50:10,026
I said "I Iove you" and "Thank you" a Iot.

1339
01:50:10,863 --> 01:50:14,731
But, that was all in the script.

1340
01:50:15,467 --> 01:50:17,833
My heart wasn't really in it.

1341
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:20,636
The reason I'm here again is

1342
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:29,306
because now I feel
that I can really say

1343
01:50:29,548 --> 01:50:32,108
I Iove you and "Thank you"
with my heart.

1344
01:50:33,552 --> 01:50:37,318
To me, Wonderful Radio was Iove.

1345
01:50:37,856 --> 01:50:39,721
After I Ieft the show Iike that,

1346
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:45,720
I missed it so much.
I missed you so much.

1347
01:50:46,865 --> 01:50:48,127
Everyone,

1348
01:50:50,269 --> 01:50:54,228
Thank you.
I Iove you.

1349
01:50:59,544 --> 01:51:05,505
I'II sing my new song, "Again".
Thank you.

1350
01:51:18,063 --> 01:51:19,121
Where are you going?

1351
01:51:20,866 --> 01:51:22,629
It's a Iive show.

1352
01:51:42,054 --> 01:51:53,727
¢Ý When darkness drapes over,
the stories offorgotten dreams

1353
01:51:54,266 --> 01:52:02,503
¢Ý songs I put aside come to me

1354
01:52:02,641 --> 01:52:10,104
¢Ý like tiny lights,
pieces of thoughts

1355
01:52:11,249 --> 01:52:14,309
¢Ý hang over the cloud

1356
01:52:15,654 --> 01:52:20,614
¢Ý and shine down on me

1357
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:28,226
¢Ý Tears and lies

1358
01:52:29,167 --> 01:52:33,433
¢Ý and feelings I couldn 't get go

1359
01:52:33,772 --> 01:52:41,008
¢Ý all the times I tried
and all the people

1360
01:52:44,049 --> 01:52:52,320
¢Ý I'm letting them go
here and now

1361
01:52:53,158 --> 01:53:03,329
I poured out my heart
but that wasn't sincere

1362
01:53:03,468 --> 01:53:08,337
- So here I go again
- Turn off the Iights!

1363
01:53:10,142 --> 01:53:12,444
What are you doing?

1364
01:53:12,444 --> 01:53:15,106
Director!

1365
01:53:16,148 --> 01:53:20,710
How can you do this to me?

1366
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:24,416
From today on,

1367
01:53:25,457 --> 01:53:27,721
I'II walking out with
all my hosts from your station.

1368
01:53:30,262 --> 01:53:32,423
- Pull them out.
- Pull them out!

1369
01:53:35,967 --> 01:53:37,069
Excuse me?

1370
01:53:37,069 --> 01:53:38,434
I said pull them out.

1371
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:43,807
There are tons of people
who are dying to working with us.

1372
01:53:44,543 --> 01:53:50,504
Go on. I'm boycotting
all your artists from this station.

1373
01:53:52,651 --> 01:53:54,653
Well, that's not what I meant...

1374
01:53:54,653 --> 01:53:56,211
PIease Ieave this room.

1375
01:53:56,555 --> 01:53:59,319
- Director! Bro!
- PIease step outside.

1376
01:53:59,558 --> 01:54:04,621
You seem to have misunderstood me.
I'II wait for you at the coffee shop.

1377
01:54:06,465 --> 01:54:08,626
What an idiot!

1378
01:54:09,167 --> 01:54:17,006
¢Ý I'm going to sing my song

1379
01:54:22,047 --> 01:54:30,113
¢Ý I'm letting it all go
here and now

1380
01:54:31,056 --> 01:54:41,227
I poured out my heart
but I wasn't sincere

1381
01:54:41,466 --> 01:54:51,102
So here I go again
I'm starting over again

1382
01:54:51,743 --> 01:55:02,017
¢Ý For me who will shine
like the stars

1383
01:55:03,255 --> 01:55:11,720
¢Ý I'm letting it all go
here and now

1384
01:55:40,058 --> 01:55:41,525
I've been Iooking all over for you.

1385
01:55:47,065 --> 01:55:50,125
What's our relationship?

1386
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:54,739
Aren't we producer and host?

1387
01:55:58,043 --> 01:55:59,010
Yes.

1388
01:56:01,346 --> 01:56:05,806
What kind of a producer sticks
his neck out for his host?

1389
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:20,024
This is from the director.

1390
01:56:23,368 --> 01:56:25,233
And I got something for you too.

1391
01:57:11,549 --> 01:57:15,654
On the house beat,
we'II add an elemnet of rock.

1392
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:17,918
And shouting!

1393
01:57:19,357 --> 01:57:20,324
What do you think?

1394
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:24,362
Not very hot, huh?
I thought so too.

1395
01:57:24,362 --> 01:57:29,067
I have a heart-ringing ballad for you.

1396
01:57:29,067 --> 01:57:32,671
Listen to the intro.

1397
01:57:32,671 --> 01:57:34,673
Ji-yeong begged me for it

1398
01:57:34,673 --> 01:57:38,143
but I kept it aside for you.

1399
01:57:38,143 --> 01:57:39,744
3 minutes!
Just give me 3 minutes.

1400
01:57:39,744 --> 01:57:48,253
This is a hiphop remake of
Lee Mija's mega hit, "Camellia Girl."

1401
01:57:48,253 --> 01:57:51,556
This bit here...
Feel the beat?

1402
01:57:51,556 --> 01:57:56,619
200 backup singers with short pants
going "Camellia girl"~~

1403
01:57:57,662 --> 01:58:01,826
It gave me goose bumps.

1404
01:58:02,067 --> 01:58:04,169
- Good job.
- Don't go.

1405
01:58:04,169 --> 01:58:06,330
Jina. PIease!

1406
01:58:07,672 --> 01:58:10,342
Hi, this is Kim Chang-wan
from Beautiful Morning.

1407
01:58:10,342 --> 01:58:13,044
- I have a real special song for you.
- Hi, I'm Park So-hyeon.

1408
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:16,047
The next song is
rather a special song.

1409
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:19,351
Bouncing back
from the plagiarism accusation,

1410
01:58:19,351 --> 01:58:20,552
the former leader of Purple and

1411
01:58:20,552 --> 01:58:24,155
beloved host
of Wonderful Radio

1412
01:58:24,155 --> 01:58:27,058
She overcame hardships
and released a new album.

1413
01:58:27,058 --> 01:58:29,160
I know what that's like.

1414
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:30,218
I'm sure you do.

1415
01:58:31,162 --> 01:58:34,366
She wrote all songs by herself.

1416
01:58:34,366 --> 01:58:35,367
That's incredible.

1417
01:58:35,367 --> 01:58:37,469
Send her your support and love.

1418
01:58:37,469 --> 01:58:41,633
and show her the power of listeners
and lover of radio.
