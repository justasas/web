1
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,058
We'll have very special guests
in the studio.

2
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:06,061
I'm Shin Jina and you're listening
to Wonderful Radio.

3
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,066
LOVE ON-AIR

4
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,770
Here's your script.

5
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,072
Thank you.

6
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,551
Aren't you tired, Baby Bun?

7
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,018
I am very much.

8
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,988
You should cut back on coffee.

9
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,548
You're not getting any younger.

10
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,793
I'II get the most expensive facial treatment
when my album comes out.

11
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,556
Ha ha, very funny.

12
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,027
Your script for part 3 and 4.

13
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,622
Who are they?

14
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:40,500
Coby Girls.

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,202
It's not Dalshabet?

16
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,601
Can we please get someone

17
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,796
that people actually know?

18
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,707
I'm more than grateful that
they agreed to come on the show.

19
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,969
Go into the studio.

20
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,571
PIease book a boy band next week.

21
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,680
Can we get Beast?

22
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,374
Two, three...

23
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,748
Hi! We're Coby Girls!

24
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,583
How pretty you all are!

25
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,712
Let's have a good show.

26
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,950
We'II do our best!

27
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,084
My word of advice would be

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,525
'always be polite.'

29
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,790
I didn't think much of it back in the day

30
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,058
when I was in Purple.

31
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,402
You were a singer?

32
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:21,362
You haven't heard of Purple?

33
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,466
You mean Iike
Tinky Winky?

34
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,842
10 seconds to go, Jina.

35
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:28,676
Sure.

36
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,051
In part 3 and 4,

37
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,694
we'II be with the new girl group,
Coby Girls.

38
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,397
Hi, everyone!
We're Coby Girls!

39
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:48,561
They are sensational,
energetic,

40
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,705
audacious and clueless

41
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:57,010
Iike the fish in the pond.

42
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,171
Wow!
Thank you so much!

43
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,642
We'II start part 3 with
Coby Girls' hit single,

44
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,944
Get out boy!

45
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,597
So you don't know
who Purple is?

46
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,199
How old are you?

47
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,565
- I'm twenty-one.
- Eighteen!

48
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,903
Back in 2004,
when Korea was...

49
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:28,308
Get out, boy
Out of my Iife

50
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,775
Great song!

51
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,772
How do I know this tune?

52
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,146
Hang on a second.

53
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,589
Recording was so hard...

54
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,250
Shut up for a minute!

55
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,254
Bro!

56
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,896
You gotta check this out.
It's genius.

57
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,364
Shin Jina is here.

58
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,467
- What?
- It's Jina.

59
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,609
- Oh shit!
- You!

60
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,409
Listen to me, honey.

61
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,410
Calm down, Jina.

62
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,112
We need to talk.

63
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,615
That song was meant for me!

64
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,385
Let's take a seat first.

65
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,687
- Open this door!
- PIease?

66
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,889
- Don't touch me!
- Let him explain.

67
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:17,753
Let go of me!

68
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,955
PIease.

69
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,460
Get over here.

70
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,457
Get your ass over here, now!

71
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:30,167
Honey, I know you're really pissed.
I understand.

72
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,965
I totally sympathize with you.
But!

73
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,777
You gotta gather your senses
especially...

74
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,886
You wrote this song for me.

75
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,189
But once I got the Iyrics...

76
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,492
It was suitable for a girl group.

77
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,550
Hey!

78
00:04:54,594 --> 00:05:00,464
My wife is due next month.

79
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,302
We're having twins.

80
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,604
It means double the cost
of everything.

81
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:08,267
I'm in a tight spot.

82
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:14,375
And more importantly,
girl groups are the trend.

83
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,975
I'm very disappointed in you.

84
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,247
I'm not taking songs from you
ever again!

85
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,758
- See you Iater, sir.
- Jina, wait!

86
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,569
Ouch!

87
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,068
What's on schedule tomorrow?

88
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:51,184
I'II text it to you
when I get home.

89
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,243
Tell me now.

90
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:59,548
You're booked
for a special private concert

91
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:05,098
for Sangmun elementary reunion,
class of 89.

92
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,500
What?!
I, Shin Jina, is to sing

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,563
at an elementary class reunion?

94
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,806
Cancel it.

95
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:18,211
Our overdraft account is
almost maxed out

96
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,615
and I have no money
to buy shampoo.

97
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:27,450
I told you my album is
coming out soon.

98
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,094
Hi!

99
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:35,795
Hello, Mrs. Shin.

100
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,958
How are you?
Grab some supper.

101
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,758
Hey!

102
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:46,906
Well, actually... I have to Iook over
tomorrow's schedule.

103
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,067
So, maybe next time.

104
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:53,074
- Bye.
- Stay! Wait!

105
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,684
Why are you being such a bitch to him?

106
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,551
There is no-one Iike him.
Be nice.

107
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,655
You're not even
paying him properly.

108
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,059
Why didn't you
take the day off?

109
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,496
I'm refreshed
and ready to work.

110
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:15,101
You never Iisten to me.
It not Iike you have any customer.

111
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:19,060
Don't be silly.

112
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:23,464
Hello!
PIease, come in.

113
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,670
You see?
Six people! Yay!

114
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,250
What a pretty girl!

115
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,250
This is the best spot
in the neighborhood.

116
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,058
What should we get?

117
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,395
I'II bring you the menu.

118
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,955
Won't be a moment.

119
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,272
Jina...

120
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,351
I celebrate two Christmases
every year.

121
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,850
One in December
and one in June.

122
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,552
This is the week I decided
to call summer Christmas week.

123
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,156
I haven't decided what
I'm going to ask Santa

124
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,961
for this Christmas in June.

125
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:31,066
Why don't you
put your June wishes

126
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,312
in the wish box

127
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:38,249
for Santa Clause
who must be bored to death

128
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,348
at this time of the year.

129
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:55,359
PIease don't Iet me
be Ionely this Christmas.

130
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:02,065
In part 2, we'II have
text messages from Iisteners.

131
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,912
It's people
that frustrate you

132
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,115
but also people that
turn dispair into hope.

133
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:13,386
Thank you, for the nice quote
and flowers.

134
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,254
Here is your requested song
from After School...

135
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,959
Actually, can I play
my request today?

136
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,798
It's Purple's
"You're my Angel"

137
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,999
- What's she doing?
- Hmm.

138
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:31,804
The producer of this show
who's been with us for 4 years

139
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,763
is taking a temporary Ieave
to have her baby.

140
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,971
This is from my heart.
Best of Iuck and see you again soon.

141
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:49,047
She's filling up the time
with her old songs?

142
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,995
You asked for me?

143
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,055
Take a seat.

144
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:06,105
Let me cut to the chase. I want you
to take charge of Wonderful Radio.

145
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,506
You mean Yun's show?

146
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:11,611
The ratings are atrocious.

147
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,813
They'II talk about dropping Jina
in the fall program reshuffle.

148
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,415
But the show is Iike
Yun's baby.

149
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:20,249
And the ratings reflect her Iove,
at only 2 percent.

150
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,090
I'II take care of Yun.

151
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,550
I need you to bring in
a fresh touch to the show.

152
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,098
- Lock up when you Ieave.
- Sure.

153
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,965
You should go home time to time.

154
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,361
See you Iater.

155
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,061
- See ya.
- Bye.

156
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,269
- Where are you going, man?
- Did you bring my spec 55 back?

157
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,010
I forgot.
I'II bring it next time.

158
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,276
- Can't use that because of you.
- AIright. I'm sorry.

159
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,248
What bring you here?

160
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,052
Heard you're joining us
as new producer.

161
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,747
Wonderful Radio.

162
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,049
- Beer?
- Give me one.

163
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,796
How come
they're sending you?

164
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,298
You can't play the songs
you Iike on our show.

165
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,562
- What is she Iike?
- Jina?

166
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,566
She's a princess.

167
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:50,374
The type I detest.

168
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,273
You're not exactly
her type either.

169
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,377
I guess.

170
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,088
Can you drive properly
for once?

171
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:07,393
You know this van used to make
squealy noise when I brake?

172
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,895
I had it Iooked at
at the service station.

173
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,159
See if you can still hear it.

174
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,269
Cha Dae-geun!

175
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,272
Shall I give her a call?

176
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,446
Hurry!

177
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,189
What took you so Iong?

178
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,591
Do you have make-up remover?

179
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,393
- What do you need it for?
- I got smudges.

180
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,797
I heard the new producer
is a bit of an ass.

181
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,662
- I heard that, too. A total asshole.
- Shutsh.

182
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,504
He's here?

183
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,369
For a while already.

184
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,311
How are you, sir?
I'm Shin Jina's trusted manager.

185
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,176
- You know, rumors are just...
- What's the time now?

186
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:06,085
We had to wait for the Ms Shin
for half an hour. What do you think?

187
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,851
Well, the traffic was terrible
for one...

188
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,994
We made introductions
before you arrive.

189
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,497
My thought is that we keep
most of the structure as it is.

190
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,761
There is one thing though.

191
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,965
Love Equation of My Life

192
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,169
It's just too corny.

193
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,909
I Iike that segment.
And the Iisteners Iove it too.

194
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,111
Besides, a bit of corniness
does good for the ratings.

195
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,875
- Aren't I right? Right?
- Who said that Iisteners Iove it?

196
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,190
I want ideas for a new segment
by 1 1 :00 tomorrow morning.

197
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,192
- That's a Iittle...
- too short-noticed.

198
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:51,255
Hey, you can't google new ideas
from off their heads.

199
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,399
Don't you know how hard it is
to come up with a new segment...

200
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,765
Isn't that what
writers are for?

201
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,865
Why do you keep
interrupting me?

202
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:04,109
Since this is our first meeting,
we should make introductions

203
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,313
and have a group dinner
or drinks to break the ice.

204
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,780
Aren't I right? Right?

205
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,747
You have beautiful eyes.

206
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,549
I get that a Iot.

207
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,292
I gotta go.

208
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:26,561
Esprresso with extra shot
for a chic city man...

209
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,659
Damn!

210
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:39,977
Lower down slowly
one vertebra at a time.

211
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,585
- Move to Jungle postion.
- Hi, sweetie.

212
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,847
Hey you!

213
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,793
How is Producer Yun?
Is she doing okay?

214
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,195
She went to have her baby.

215
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,459
Who's taking her place?

216
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,355
We got a new producer.

217
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,002
- A male?
- Yes.

218
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,664
but he is a total BCM.

219
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,907
A BIase City Man?

220
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,569
No, a Big-headed City Moron.

221
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:17,046
Well, the real morons were...
Coby Girls?

222
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,184
I could have given them a good smack.

223
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,651
If only I met them
back in the day.

224
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:25,448
We were the business
back in the day.

225
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,252
Remember the sound we used to
hear every weekend?

226
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,764
Ans this weeks No. 1 goes to...
Puuuurple!

227
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,060
I would Iike to thank
all our fans and

228
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:39,004
our supporters from "Purple Scent".
I Iove every one of you!

229
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:44,009
PIease give it up for Purple
performing "You're my Angel"!

230
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,572
? You are my angel, angel,
angel to me

231
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:54,652
? I'll cherish your love
forever and ever

232
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,551
? You're my angel...

233
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,894
See you all again.

234
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,658
We Iove you!

235
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,669
I miss the days.

236
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,778
Camera,

237
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,249
- Roll!
- 3 of 23,

238
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,143
Action!

239
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,668
Cut! That Iooks good.
Stop. That's enough.

240
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,605
Hey, camera!
Get a close-up.

241
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,706
Was that an okay, director?

242
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,764
Okay.

243
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,568
I said okay already.

244
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,669
You did great, Mira.

245
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:58,042
Cut! Cut! That's good.
Fanstastic.

246
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,387
- One more take!
- We got no time.

247
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,346
- Are we making a movie here?
- Fine. That was great, Mr. Lee.

248
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,295
You should think about
making commercials in series.

249
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,598
They used good old Mama Kim

250
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,899
for the seasoning commercial
for decades

251
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:18,303
and the same grizzly bear
for Iiver supplelment ads.

252
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,807
Segi Hearing Aid campaign went on
for a decade with just the Ieft ear.

253
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,210
The fat-and-tall duo practically
grew old with the pump company.

254
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,974
- Think along the same Iine with Mira.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:34,887
I'm having great days
because of your boys and girls.

256
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:40,092
I owe it all to you.

257
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,461
Especially the 1 0 o'clock girl group,

258
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,198
what are they called again?

259
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,462
- Pink Dolls?
- That's right!

260
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,868
The rating is fantastic.

261
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,107
You did good
picking the right host.

262
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:59,111
1 0 O'clock Iisteners are
mostly students

263
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,214
so girl or boy band is right.

264
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,385
6 o'clock is all about people
getting off work and taxi drivers.

265
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,288
so, you want a popular face,

266
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,554
Someone Iike Yun Mira, for example.
What do you think?

267
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,756
- Mira?
- Yeah.

268
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,997
- Sounds good.
- Right?

269
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:19,898
That's right.

270
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:24,303
Nan-sol put a Iot of thought
into that.

271
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,361
And?

272
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,708
How can you dismiss her Iike that

273
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,310
when she tried so hard?

274
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,778
I don't care about working hard.
I care about doing well.

275
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,785
There are three virtues
that make a good radio host.

276
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,788
Popularity, talent and personality.

277
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:48,055
Shouldn't you have
at Ieast one of them?

278
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,997
Why are you telling me this?

279
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:56,764
I want you to refrain from displaying
your emotion during a meeting.

280
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,575
What's it gonna take?

281
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:09,881
4 percent.

282
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,646
Only 4?

283
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,752
You never surpassed 2 percent
in the Iast 6 months.

284
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,250
You shouldn't be hung up on the past.
You should dream big.

285
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:29,261
Why don't you come up with
an idea for a new segment, then?

286
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,270
Me? Ha ha ha...

287
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,409
Why not?
I can totally do it.

288
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,612
I'II do it.

289
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,843
No problem.
I can do it.

290
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,151
I'II Iook forward to it, then.

291
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:59,362
Where did he come from?

292
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,157
What am I supposed to do?

293
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,468
Shall we get the next one?

294
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,068
Never mind.

295
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,073
Oh, hi!

296
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,868
Long time.

297
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,741
I Iike your TV series.

298
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,248
I'm glad you Iike it.

299
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,349
But I'm sorry.

300
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,796
I never get the chance to
Iisten to your radio

301
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,060
when that's the only thing
you do.

302
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,262
You gotta do better
than that, Jina.

303
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:46,069
After walking out
on Purple Iike that!

304
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,344
Bye.

305
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:11,563
You're my angel, angel,
angel to me

306
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,506
I'II cherish your Iove
forever and ever.

307
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,973
Jina!

308
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:25,146
You're perfect today
Iike you were yesterday.

309
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:31,045
There is nothing
I want to ask of you.

310
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,759
The way you Iook at me
makes me feel great.

311
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:41,700
I can understand
your every gaze.

312
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,967
You read my mind.
I give all my heart to you.

313
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,610
I only want to give you joy

314
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,915
You're my angel, angel,
angel to me.

315
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:01,486
I'II cherish your Iove
forever and ever.

316
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,852
I got mid-terms tomorrow!

317
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,057
But you're way more important
than exams to me!

318
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:14,855
I'm nobody without you.

319
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,962
You're my angel.

320
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,141
One more time! One more time!

321
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,754
You're not gonna make
the announcement now, are you?

322
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,098
Don't, Jina.

323
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,100
Give it another thought, please.

324
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,159
It doesn't have to be today.

325
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:58,069
Thank you all for coming
to our show tonight.

326
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,872
Tonight,

327
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,548
I would Iike to make
an important announcement.

328
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,351
As of this moment,
Purple is splitting up.

329
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,067
No! Is she serious?

330
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,463
Thank you guys...

331
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,468
for all your Iove and support.

332
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:53,060
Extend the other arm
to the side.

333
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:00,269
Look at the tip of the hand.

334
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:07,873
Those who can, fold your arm
and Iock your hands together.

335
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,076
Breathe in.

336
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,944
Breathe out.

337
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,053
Breathing in slowly,

338
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,749
expanding your Iungs
and chest.

339
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:24,055
Breathe out and relax
your strained muscles.

340
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,460
Focus only on yourself
during the practice.

341
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,568
How do you know each other?

342
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,212
He's the new producer
I told you about.

343
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:44,282
From the radio?
The BCM?

344
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,840
Hey!

345
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,249
How do you know each other?

346
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,258
Don't you know
Ji In-yeong from Purple?

347
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,855
You don't know me?

348
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,864
The curvaceous In-yeong?

349
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,766
Right...

350
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,053
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

351
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,860
What!

352
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,803
- What's wrong with him?
- You forgot your push-ups.

353
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,670
Can't wear them
during yoga!

354
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,566
Good to meet you.
Let's work hard.

355
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,414
Why don't you
take them out for dinner?

356
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,438
Yes, sir.

357
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,641
See you around.

358
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,656
Are we goddamn Unicef?

359
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,095
They Iook Iike orphans
from third world.

360
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,997
What are you going to do
about me?

361
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,363
Give me some time.
It's sweeps week soon.

362
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,660
Are you sure about this?

363
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,604
We have the hottest
hosts and DJs.

364
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,905
What have you got
to worry about?

365
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:20,211
So, take care of this
once and for all.

366
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:24,045
Taking care of things is
what I do.

367
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:29,149
Let's get something to eat.

368
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,449
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

369
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,893
I heard about it. Is it true?

370
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,157
...that I moved to 6 o'clock?

371
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,953
I mean working with Shin Jina.

372
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,601
- Do you know her?
- Of course.

373
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,804
She was a regular on our show
in the Purple days.

374
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,806
They were great.
I Ioved their song.

375
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,407
You're my angel...

376
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:53,211
I ran into her the other day.
She asked me about you.

377
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,714
- What did you tell her?
- That you're an asshole.

378
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,282
Well, you are.

379
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,648
AII the hosts despise you.

380
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,688
Anyway, be good to her.

381
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,890
She's not what she seems.

382
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,293
She's Ioyal, sexy and
has a pure soul.

383
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,557
Unlike you, asshole.

384
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,854
How's yoga working out?

385
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,001
It's driving me up the wall.
I'm so stiff.

386
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,004
You need to have flexible mind
as well as your body.

387
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,605
It's all about the Yoga Fire.

388
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,507
- You know what I'm saying?
- Sure, bro.

389
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,872
- The whole namaste deal.
- That's right.

390
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,567
- Hey,
- Hmm?

391
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,573
Don't drink-and-broadcast again.

392
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,682
Technically,
it was 'after'-drinks broadcasting.

393
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,343
- That's right.
- Don't mention that again.

394
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,787
- AImost destroyed us.
- That was a sweaty moment.

395
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,051
- See you around.
- A nightmare.

396
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,448
You want a drink Iater?

397
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,850
- I'II call you.
- Sure. See ya.

398
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,554
They say even a person who brushes
your sleeve is predestined by your karma.

399
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,599
Look around you.

400
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,403
At this very moment in time,

401
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:55,863
those around me are
my predestined fates.

402
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:02,777
So are all of you out there who'II be
Iistening to me for the next 2 hours.

403
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,650
You're Iistening to Wonderful Radio,
and I'm your host, Shin Jina.

404
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:14,452
I have in front of me, the new producer
for our show, Mr. Lee Jin-hyeok.

405
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:19,353
He's a cool guy
who only drinks iced coffee.

406
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,562
Let's do a good job together.

407
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,670
Ideas for new segment?

408
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:51,052
How dare you!

409
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,460
Next song, Nan-sol.

410
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:01,665
- Here is the first song.
- Rady?

411
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:06,266
Sistar sings "How dare you".

412
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,144
y shoulders feel stiff
around this time.

413
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,159
We'll change song to
"Like Rain, Like Music"

414
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,678
The opening song
for part 3 is

415
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:18,144
also a perfect song
for a rainy day Iike today.

416
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:22,242
It's "Like Rain Like Music"
by Kim Gwang-seok.

417
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,065
Who's song is this?

418
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,667
Oh, is it by Kim Hyeon-sik?

419
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,563
I'II make correction
after the song.

420
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,167
And you're off the hook?

421
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,713
Hey, it was a mistake.

422
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,443
I get the two mixed up
all the time.

423
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,447
How can you get them
mixed up?

424
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,588
Hey, we're in the middle
of a Iive show.

425
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,689
- Let go of me.
- Get out of there.

426
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,491
And, you call yourself a singer?

427
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,549
Get out!

428
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,155
Did you see that?

429
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:08,155
Did you see me slam the table?
What they say about you was true.

430
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,668
- They can't hear me outside, right?
- No.

431
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,771
You're a dog!
You're goddamn dog.

432
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,710
- He must have gotten my message.
- I feel dizzy.

433
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,075
Walk on your paws, bastard!

434
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,345
So, the rumor was true.

435
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,656
Pretty-face,
you got some time?

436
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,463
I got time
but no energy.

437
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,464
Are you still mad?

438
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,707
What's wrong with him?

439
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,574
He's a damn psycho!

440
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,313
You know...

441
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,544
If someone bad-mouthes the music
I Ioved in my 20s,

442
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,451
you can feel offended as if
they're insulting my memories.

443
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:07,792
I wasn't insulting.
I just got the names wrong.

444
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,353
If anyone referred to
Purple as Pink,

445
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,258
I know I'd flip out
there and then.

446
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:26,976
This is his heydays.
Listen to it on your way home.

447
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:33,949
It gets further
?and further away.

448
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:44,095
?what I thought was
?a lingering youth

449
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:49,158
?Within my emptying heart,

450
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:56,965
?l can't find anything anymore.

451
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:05,545
?Even though the seasons returns,

452
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,765
BCM - Today is deadline
for new segment ideas

453
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,977
You got cold?

454
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,840
Mom, shall I quit radio?

455
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,146
Do as you please.

456
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:47,849
I don't care
if you sing in a cabaret.

457
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,096
How can you talk that way
to your daughter?

458
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,598
I'm Shin Jina from Purple!

459
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,761
I'm not done.
I'II sing again.

460
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,270
Quiet down, will you?

461
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:05,867
This all started from the day
you started that radio show.

462
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:15,548
? How long should I live

463
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:23,250
? before I see you again

464
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:33,267
? Over the river of time,
our love sways

465
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,864
That's it.

466
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,073
Mom, that's it! I got it.

467
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,242
Yes!

468
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,744
What's gotten into her?

469
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,645
Start gathering stories
so we can start next week.

470
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,659
I told you
he would Iike it.

471
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,356
I used to win essay comepetition
back in elementary school.

472
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:35,861
Let's go!

473
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,261
- One, two, three,
- Go!

474
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:45,309
This is a new segment from the show,

475
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,912
The Song I Sing to You

476
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:52,645
The first guest we have on the show
is a 22-year-old soldier

477
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,786
who took time off
his precious Ieave.

478
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,949
Shall we hear it from him?

479
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,059
My name is Jeong Gwang-tae.
I'm serving in Cheolwon.

480
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:09,965
I came in to talk about this girl
that I have a crush on

481
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,705
who won't return my feelings.

482
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:19,911
I went AWOL Iast year
because of her

483
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,613
and got in some serious trouble
for that.

484
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,548
You should never go that far.

485
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,346
Shall we hear your song then?

486
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,456
With all my heart,
I would Iike to sing.

487
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,194
Jeong Yeob's 'Nothing Very.'

488
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,997
Let's hear it from him.
'Nothing Better'

489
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:45,560
Lim Seul-gi, English Major
at Hanyang University!

490
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,967
I'II be your boyfriend
after I get out of the army.

491
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,809
- Wait for me!
- Calm down

492
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,676
and Iet's hear you sing,
'Nothing Better'

493
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,782
Suyuri angel, Lim Seul-gi!

494
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,147
Lim Seul-gi!

495
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:14,498
? Rest in me like in the dreams
and stay with me forever

496
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,966
Are you okay, Seul-gi?

497
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:22,168
Would you be okay,
if you were her?

498
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:28,913
? I would always stay
by your side

499
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:35,186
? Nothing better,
nothing better than you

500
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,154
For crying out Ioud!

501
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:42,693
I'II kill him!

502
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,661
? Nothing better...

503
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,101
Nothing better than you

504
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:54,405
Driver,
please turn off the radio!

505
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,908
We had tons of complaints and

506
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:03,414
criticisms abour your Iittle stunt.

507
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,184
This is actually a good segment.
If you give it some time...

508
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:12,690
Raising the ratings is good but

509
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,751
why don't we just drop the program
in the next reshuffle?

510
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,062
Excuse me?

511
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,557
Think about it, okay?

512
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:51,856
What are you doing here?

513
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,499
Did you get told off?

514
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,059
Did you think
I got praises for that?

515
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:02,765
I'm sorry.

516
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,876
About what?

517
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:12,146
- Well, it was my idea...
- I made the decision.

518
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,946
I take responsibility for my decisions.
That's part of my job.

519
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,354
Don't worry.
I'II take care of my team.

520
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,683
Are you trying
to blow up the car?

521
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,686
Why didn't you
get it checked?

522
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,690
What are you gonna do
if I'm Iate?

523
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,657
I am so sorry.

524
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,655

532
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:45,772

533
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,012

534
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,814

536
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:05,255
The Song I Sing to You

537
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:10,661
We have in the studio
a 42-year-old cab driver.

538
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,770
Would you Iike
to tell us your story?

539
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,370
Hi!

540
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,381

541
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,382
Shutsh!

542
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:31,548
I have a Ietter for my wife
which I never got to send her.

543
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,050
That why I came
on the show today.

544
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,271
Hi, honey!
It's me, Ji-hyeong.

545
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:55,367
It's been almost 3 years
since you went to heaven.

546
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,338
I want to say sorry first

547
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,347
for putting you
through a hard Iife.

548
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,153
I'm sorry
I never wrote you a Ietter

549
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,354
when you were still
with me.

550
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:15,764
I practiced the Dongmulwon song
that you Iiked.

551
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:21,662
You used to tease
for being a terrible singer.

552
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,165
So, hear me out.

553
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:39,949

558
00:42:55,306 --> 00:43:00,471

PIease don't take her away.

562
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,958
Let her stay with me.

563
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,159
I beg you.

564
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,360
I'm so sorry.

565
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,664

579
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,165
- Hello, Mr. Lee!
- Hi.

580
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:42,106
Why did you say hi?

581
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,407
He is your dad.

582
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,510
- Urgh!
- Hey, wait.

583
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,774
Forget it.

584
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:52,043
- Wait!
- No!

585
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,765
Did you have dinner,
sweetheart?

586
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,362
Answer your dad.

587
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,169
Forget it.

588
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,410
- Mister?
- Yes, honey.

589
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,277
Don't you say hi
to my friends.

590
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,938
Oh... Sorry about that.

591
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,787
- Da-heui!
- Leave her alone.

592
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,846
She's at the age.

593
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:10,494
I don't get to see you much
these days,

594
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,155
so I'll leave this here.

595
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:17,301
I want you to do
what you love doing best.

596
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:21,362
I love it when your sing.

597
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,373
You're daddy's number one girl.

598
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:28,574
To me, you're the best
in the world.

599
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,440
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

600
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,459
Thank you.

601
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:12,646
Congrats!

602
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:19,754
I owe it all to you.
Congratulations.

603
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,057
Is something
I can take credit for?

604
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,071
You write, too?

605
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:38,081
I've written tons of songs.

606
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,946
I didn't expect that.

607
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,286
What do you mean?

608
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,049
You're an ex-girl group member.

609
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,654
What about that?

610
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,557
Girl groups aren't supposed
to write music?

611
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,094
What are you doing here still?

612
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,756
That bastard producer is
keeping you...

613
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:55,960
Oh, good afternoon.

614
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,669
I'II be at the car.

615
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,263
Hope you have a good afternoon.

616
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,437
Every single week,
he never skips once.

617
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,048
A florist?

618
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,048
Whoever he is,
he must be a scentful man.

619
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,453
You'd think, eh?

620
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,494
- Hi.
- Hey.

621
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,657
This is today's
guest info and story.

622
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,803
Make sure Jina reads it
before we start.

623
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,668
She picked this story herself.

624
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:40,811
Hi, everyone!

625
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,812
- Hey!
- How are you?

626
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,972
Hello...

627
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:51,450
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

628
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,856
Listen to what?

629
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,360
Honey?

630
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:10,771
Da-heui just texted me
and told me to turn on the radio.

631
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,272
The radio?

632
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,281
"The Song I Sing to You"

633
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:23,487
We have a sweet highschool girl
in the studio today.

634
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,047
- Hi, there?
- Hi.

635
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,192
My name is Yun Da-heui.

636
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,854
I'm a junior at high school.

637
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:36,063
Would you Iike to tell us
your story and your song?

638
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:43,168
Dad, can you hear me?

639
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:47,065
I'm on the radio
that you used to adore.

640
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:51,541
You know
mom got remarried.

641
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,149
To this ugly-Iooking man.

642
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,146
But,

643
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,757
he is real good to mom.

644
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:11,667
Mom and I had it real hard
since you died.

645
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,370
But that ugly man

646
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:21,076
who I really really hate

647
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:28,442
he says he is so happy
to have a daughter Iike me.

648
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,451
If it's okay with you, dad,

649
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:44,861
I want to accept him as family.

650
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:51,668
I'm so sorry I've been a brat.

651
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,641
And thank you for the present...

652
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,244
Dad.

653
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:16,399
? I wish you knew
how I felt

654
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:23,362
? even though
I couldn't come closer

655
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:31,143
? How much I wanted to

656
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:38,150
? my tears say it all

657
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:47,297
? We loved each other
and loathed each other

658
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:54,465
? You cared for me more than anything
and I miss you so much

659
00:52:54,704 --> 00:53:03,078
I never got close even
when you were with me

660
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:10,852
? Oh did I hate you!

661
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:16,793
? Please hear me out
Hear my story

662
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:23,255
? I need more time

663
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:32,967
? We loved each other
and loathed each other

664
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:40,383
? You treasured me more than anything
and I miss you so much

665
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:48,757
? I never got it out of my chest

666
00:53:50,093 --> 00:54:00,662
? but, I really really loved you

667
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,144
You have a good eye
for picking stories.

668
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,957
I do what I can.

669
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,156
I have a question for you.

670
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,564
What does this show
mean to you?

671
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,663
It's a space
where I tell my stories

672
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,670
Before, at Ieast.
Now it's different.

673
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:47,439
I Iisten to others' stories,
share the stories and console them.

674
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:51,147
and I end up getting consoled.

675
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,952
I Iearn a Iot.

676
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,662
I want to do music.

677
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:09,069
I feel as if I finally know
what I want to talk about.

678
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:12,475
Jina!

679
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,512
- Oh, Jina! You won't believe this.
- Ouch! Hot!

680
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,913
You won't believe this.

681
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:20,884
It's all over Youtube and
is taking over the internet.

682
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:24,445
Hello?
How have you been, Mr. Bae?

683
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:25,946
You'd Iike an interview?

684
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,858
How Iong you been with her?

685
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,758
- 3 days.
- 3 days?

686
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,099
- Sounds Iike a serious stuff.
- Yeah, only 3 more days...

687
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:39,364
That's commitment.
I'm thrilled for you, man.

688
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:10,458
?You're my angel, angel,
?angel to me.

689
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:16,766
?I'll cherish your love
?forever and ever.

690
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:24,043
?You're perfect today
?like you were yesterday.

691
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:28,440
?There is nothing
?l want to ask of you.

692
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,745
This is all we got time
for this evening.

693
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:34,591
It's a Iovely evening
with cool breeze.

694
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:38,459
How about some soju
and pork bone soup?

695
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:41,459
There is a song that comes
to my mind on a day Iike this.

696
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,666
Lee Seung-hwan sings

697
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,368
'Darkness and Star Lights'

698
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,371
It's a Kim Hyeon-sik Song

699
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,882
Lee Seung-hwan's warm voice
tugging at your heart string...

700
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,884
Is there is a remake version
by Lee Seung-hwan?

701
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:06,289
We'II Iisten to this Iast song
and sign off for the night.

702
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,950
Hope you have a wonderful evening.

703
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,367
I hear Wonderful Radio
really hit it off.

704
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,981
As you heard,
Jae-hyeok did a great job.

705
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:36,645
Congratulations, bro.

706
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,551
What's going to happen
to our arrangement?

707
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:48,598
Come on,
you know how it works.

708
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,465
I can't pull down someone
who's doing well.

709
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,464
Listen, man.

710
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:58,608
I'm in the position
of asking you favors.

711
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:03,636
But position can always change,
you know?

712
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,940
You know how things work
in this business.

713
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:12,653
If I drop Shin Jina now,
it'II only stir up gossips.

714
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:23,055
?It's not like I let her go.

715
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,163
Jae-hyeok,

716
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,772
who do you Iike best?
Kim Hyeon-sik or Kim Gwang-seok?

717
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,276
Kim Gwang-seok.

718
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,580
Then, Iet's play a game.
You name all the Kim Gwang-seok songs,

719
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,483
and, I'II name Kim Hyeon-sik songs.
How about it?

720
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:43,186
Forget it. You can't even get
'Like Rain Like Music' right.

721
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,788
Loser must do a favor
for the winner.

722
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,449
Sounds fun!

723
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,194
'Like Rain Like Music'

724
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,595
I'm not playing.

725
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,497
Ten, nine,

726
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,198
- Eight,
- Eight...

727
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,699
'I Loved You but'

728
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,001
'Spring Summer Fall Winter'

729
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,161
'Around Thirty'

730
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:00,803
'Watercolor on a Rainy Day'

731
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,405
But, that's not his song.

732
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,067
He sang it with
Gang In-won and Gwon In-ha.

733
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,209
She's right.

734
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,870
AIright. Fine.

735
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,172
'Story of an OId Couple'

736
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,282
Wrong answer!
Learn your songs.

737
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:16,386
The correct title is
'Story of an OId Couple in 60s'

738
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,388
- Hurrah.
- Yay, I won!

739
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,692
- Wish! Wish!
- Wish! Wish!

740
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,093
Wish! Wish!

741
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,651
Wait a minute.

742
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,399
Swap over.
I'II do Kim Hyeon-sik.

743
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,368
- Boo!
- Boo you. You Iost.

744
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:34,968
Is this your favorite restaurant?

745
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:38,264
I guess.
I come here everyday.

746
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,812
This Iiquor does wonders
for your health.

747
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:43,680
Thank you.

748
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,483
Ma'am, the soup is amazing today!

749
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:50,748
When wasn't it ever?

750
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:58,149
You're a real handsome man.

751
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,797
Uh... do you know me?

752
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,899
Of course! Mr. BCM.

753
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,060
What are you doing, Mrs. Lee?

754
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,662
But you call him BCM.
Big-headed City Man, right?

755
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,810
I forgot to make
the introduction.

756
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,312
This is Mrs. Lee,
the owner of this restaurant

757
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,837
and my mother.

758
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,888
I Iisten to your show religiously.

759
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,791
My Jina has a bit of a temper

760
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,493
but in the core,
she is really an angel.

761
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:34,397
PIease guide her and treat her well.

762
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,763
I don't have a temper.

763
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:38,401
Shut up.

764
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,505
And I may be worrying for nothing,

765
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,666
- but I Iet me just say this.
- Yes, ma'am.

766
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:49,612
I'm against office relationship.

767
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,281
It might sound Iike
an oblivious bragging but

768
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,984
she is so pretty and as her mother
it's only natural to worry...

769
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,486
Mom!

770
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,647
What! I almost shit my pants,
damn it!

771
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,557
Oops... I'd better go.

772
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,155
Careful.

773
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,959
- Make sure she gets homes.
- Sure.

774
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,171
She Iooks heavy.

775
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,471
He's a good man.

776
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,177
Oh, my head.

777
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,545
This is a surprise.

778
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,347
What is?

779
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,845
I mean

780
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:34,354
your Iooking after everyone.

781
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,455
I always do.

782
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:40,897
I'm getting another drink!

783
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,956
- Hey!
- Calm down, darling.

784
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,765
Take a seat
wherever you want.

785
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,341
I didn't say my wish
from the game.

786
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:01,843
Go on, then.

787
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,548
A surprise present
for my birthday.

788
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,154
When is your birthday?

789
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,664
This will tell you.

790
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,667
I really Iike
your new segment.

791
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:29,875
I got the idea from mom.

792
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:36,886
When I younger, my dad's fishing boat
went missing in Russian Sea.

793
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:40,447
Mom said
she Iike the word.

794
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:41,952
'Missing'

795
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,753
Not deceased by missing.

796
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:53,767
So she always wears make-up
and we never moved house.

797
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:59,408
My dad Ioved mom's singing.

798
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:02,775
So, she always hums it.

799
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,946
That's where I got the idea.

800
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:22,455
This is the first and Iast gift
that my dad ever got me.

801
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,657
You know
what I wrote with it?

802
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:27,567
What was it?

803
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:31,965
My first song, 'You're My Angel.'

804
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,173
It's a good song.

805
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,243
You're actually paying complement?

806
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,746
Your song has a story.

807
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:47,145
Oh, I'm a gal with stories.

808
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:50,649
You don't write any more?

809
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:54,556
I can't.

810
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,962
Something's missing here.

811
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,572
Bottoms up!

812
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,668
You poured a Iot more for me.

813
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:07,969
Bottoms up.

814
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,346
Man, it's strong.

815
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,952
One more?

816
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:20,653
Hey you!
Where are you going?

817
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,057
- You talking to me?
- Walk straight.

818
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,896
I'm not going anywhere.

819
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,262
I'm way past my Iimit.

820
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,901
Two, three, four.

821
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,062
I'm feeling great.

822
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,908
I had drinks with a celebrity.

823
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,877
Where are we going now?

824
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,882
I want more soju.

825
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:50,286
Let's go that way.

826
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:51,888
Come on, celebrity.

827
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,856
Come on!

828
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,069
Go away.

829
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:16,942
Where are we?

830
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,348
We're at a motel.

831
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,749
You, fucking pervert!

832
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,849
Is that why you tried so hard
to get me drunk?

833
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,397
Calm down, Nan-sol.

834
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:37,300
Don't come up here,
you monster!

835
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,701
Hey, wait! Wait!

836
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,404
You weren't...
really human Iast night.

837
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,906
What?

838
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:47,109
Are you saying that we were
Iike animals here together, you and I?

839
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,812
No no no no no.
That's not what I'm saying.

840
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:51,781
So, you don't remember.

841
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,884
I was driving
and you were Iike...

842
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,485
you were spitting at me.
Remember?

843
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,488
You were calling me names.
Said you weren't going home.

844
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,457
Then, you said you were transforming
and started taking off your clothes.

845
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:08,597
Liar!
I would never do that!

846
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:09,598
But I'm telling the truth.

847
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,759
What have you got there?

848
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,906
Look at you!
In your boxers.

849
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,709
Where are your pants? Huh?

850
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:20,609
What did you do to me?

851
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,169
You threw up on my pants!

852
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,382
It was gross.
I couldn't sleep because of that.

853
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:30,286
Grossed me out.
I threw up washing my pants.

854
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:33,389
There are times
when nothing consols you.

855
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:36,092
When the burden is too heavy.

856
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:41,097
Wonderful Radio would Iike to be
your family, your friend and Iover.

857
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:47,058
Cheer up, Mommy
We're always here for you

858
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:52,172
I Iove you darling dearly

859
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:14,654
Wait outside.

860
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:26,609
Contratulations! Your show is
the talk of the town.

861
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:28,811
Will we be hearing
your new album soon?

862
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:32,581
I've been actually getting
some offers.

863
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,283
Then it won't be very far off.

864
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,547
Hopefull not.

865
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,657
What are you doing here?

866
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,958
We can only Iearn about Iove...

867
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,098
PIease keep this
a secret from Jina.

868
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:54,866
Dae-geun,
we were meant for each other.

869
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:03,367
The Song I Sing to You
we have 1 3th guest on the show.

870
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:06,046
She is 29 years old

871
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:10,086
and describes herself
as umemployed wannabe musician.

872
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,351
Shall we hear her story?

873
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:20,256
This song I'm singing today
is dedicated to you, Miss Shin.

874
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:25,456
To me? What a great honor.
Thank you!

875
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:29,805
I'II tell my story
through this song.

876
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,774
A round of applause for her?

877
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:41,944
?Why do moments of crisis
?pass so slowly?

878
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:49,948
?Why is time of endurance
?always so long?

879
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:56,156
?Am I getting over it
?or just getting used to it?

880
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:03,867
?What's at the end
?of all this wandering?

881
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:11,542
Someone is posting
a Youtube Iink on our website.

882
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:16,285
?Make you stronger

883
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,549
If this was written in 2002,

884
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:24,219
?Make yourself stronger

885
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,863
No... It can't be.

886
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:32,963
?Never change

887
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:39,668
You recognize this melody,
don't you?

888
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:44,780
This is the song called "Island"
which I wrote and released back in 2002.

889
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,943
I was approached about an album deal
but it fell through.

890
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:52,087
Because the hottest girl band
at the time, Purple

891
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:54,647
released a song
with the same melody.

892
01:09:55,491 --> 01:10:02,698
But, I wrote this song.

893
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,501
You must be mistaken.
Don't get heated up

894
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:06,866
I'm mistaken?

895
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:12,672
I came here to get my song back.
Just close up the song

896
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:18,645
The song that you stole from me.

897
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:22,041
Can you vouch
for your accusation?

898
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:28,591
How can you prove
that this song is yours?

899
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,752
The footage of me performing it.

900
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,653
And the song I just sang.

901
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,162
What more do you need?

902
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,967
You're My Angel?
Purple?

903
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:44,607
My ass...

904
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:47,109
You fucking psycho!

905
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,510
Turn off the mic! Now!

906
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,912
What are you saying?

907
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:50,579
- Jina, calm down.
- Jina.

908
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,981
- You want me to say it?
- Jina, please.

909
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,283
You're telling a Iie on-air.

910
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,184
- Calm down, Jina.
- Jina.

911
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,742
PIease calm down.

912
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,459
Jina, what happened in there?

913
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:16,205
You cursed and blurted out
on a Iive show.

914
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:20,509
Am I supposed to say nothing?
She accused me of plagiarism.

915
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:24,240
Footages with dates are
being posted on our website.

916
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,547
How do you explain that?

917
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,153
You're Iike the rest of them.

918
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:40,253
You don't believe me, do you?

919
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,458
I gotta go.

920
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,859
Jina!

921
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:53,909
You should have shut down
the mic and played music.

922
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,467
What's going to happen to Jina?

923
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,135
You're asking me?

924
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,082
She's axed forever!

925
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,084
She must be given a chance
to explain herself.

926
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,552
Explain what?

927
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:09,391
PIagiarism is a secondary issue.
She acted irresponsibly on the Iive show.

928
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:14,761
What did I tell you?
We should've changed her.

929
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,557
Mira would have never
made a mistake Iike that.

930
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:22,768
Since you mention it,

931
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:26,008
will it be possible for Mira to fill in?

932
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:28,272
Come on, bro.

933
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,580
That makes Mira a stand-in.

934
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,782
You're not making sense.

935
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:37,741
That's why I came to you.
I'm asking you a favor.

936
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:47,096
Only because you're asking.

937
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,757
Thanks, man.

938
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,363
When will I ever benefit from you?

939
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:54,068
It's tricky.

940
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,573
Plagiarism, cursing on-air
Shin is falling from grace once again

941
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,350
Hi, In-yeong.

942
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:22,263
Are you alright, sweetie?

943
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:31,407
Are you home alone?
I'll come over.

944
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:36,071
I'm okay.
What are you worrying about?

945
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:42,642
You are not keeping quiet
because of me. Are you?

946
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,187
I'm really okay.

947
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:49,055
I don't care
what people think about my past.

948
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:55,798
So, just think only about yourself.
Okay?

949
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:57,561
I know. I gotta go.

950
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,866
Jina!

951
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,579
What flows faster than time?

952
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:14,037
It's been almost 1 month
since I joined.

953
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,586
You feel Iike family to me now.

954
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,349
How do you feel?

955
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,552
Let me play
one of favorite songs.

956
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:26,554
Lee Seung-cheol sings
'Super Hero'

957
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:31,859
How did I do?

958
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:42,211
It's a Lee Seung-hwan song.
Make a correction after the song.

959
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:45,781
Did I? I'm sorry.
I'II make a correction.

960
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:50,650
Shall we get some sushi
after the show? I'II buy.

961
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,653
- Maybe some other time.
- Promise?

962
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,092
Heard any news about Jina?

963
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,495
Nothing at all.

964
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:03,556
I doubt she'II ever
be able to come back.

965
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:14,867
Did you know that this team
faced a crisis once?

966
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:18,380
We were doing really well

967
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,747
and the director was going to get
bigger producers and writers for the show.

968
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:24,648
And you know what Jina did?

969
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:26,488
She confronted him

970
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:30,652
saying if he was ignoning the hardwork
of everyone who made this show happen.

971
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:34,654
It must have been shocking.

972
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:41,558
What good is all that
when she can't Iook after herself?

973
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:46,068
?What's at the end?

974
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:18,106
Excuse me.
Is Mr. Cho still in a meeting?

975
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:20,666
I have an appointment at two.

976
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,135
One moment, please.

977
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:31,887
Mr. Cho,
Ms Shin Jina is still waiting...

978
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,445
Yes, sir.

979
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:41,296
Lingering memory slowly...

980
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,163
That's enough. Thanks.

981
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,002
It doesn't move me.
At all.

982
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:53,771
I'II give my everything
Iike this is the first time.

983
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,811
If you only believe in me...

984
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:58,680
You don't have that feeling

985
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,946
from the days as Purple.

986
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,449
Let's not have this conversation.

987
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:13,851
Anyway...
Are you sure you wrote this song?

988
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,004
Infinity is the Iaw.

989
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:23,705
Forget Infinity.
Beast is the best.

990
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:25,307
- Infinity rules.
- No, Beast.

991
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,109
Isn't that Shin Jina over there?

992
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:30,738
The plagiarist?

993
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,583
- Did you watch Entertainment Now?
- No.

994
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:39,452
She was acting as if she was all that.
Look at her now.

995
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:45,954
You can't guess
what they are capable.

996
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:48,997
Oh my gosh, did you hear her
go berserk on radio?

997
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:49,498
No.

998
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:53,764
It was a total disaster.

999
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:58,507
Look at her holding her guitar.
So she is still a musician, huh?

1000
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,709
Come on, she might hear us.
Let's get out of here.

1001
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:02,267
Let's go.

1002
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,348
There is no gig today?

1003
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,349
No.

1004
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:28,657
Business is slow.
I can't afford Iive bands.

1005
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:31,456
Are you a musician?

1006
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:36,467
No, I was just thinking about someone
who played here 1 0 years ago.

1007
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:40,809
That can't be.
We've been only open for 4 years.

1008
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:43,744
- There was an internet shop before.
- What?

1009
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:45,437
Look.

1010
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:53,552
I want to move my beauty shop.

1011
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:56,391
But you only just changed.

1012
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:58,894
They keep making me wait.

1013
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,658
Then you should cut in.

1014
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:05,901
I'm in a tight spot.

1015
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,804
People keep asking me
when my next song is coming out.

1016
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,066
Your song?

1017
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:14,109
I got that arranged
with a composer.

1018
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,179
He will write something that
you can publish under your name.

1019
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,544
- Really?
- Of course.

1020
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:22,384
He is in a meeting now.

1021
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,686
Look what we have here.

1022
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:25,744
You can't barge in here Iike this.

1023
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,691
What brought you here?

1024
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:30,953
So...

1025
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,697
- 1 0 years ago, was it?
- Pardon me?

1026
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:38,962
You said you performed "Island"
back in 2002.

1027
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,669
That's right. Why?

1028
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:48,268
You played a gig in 2002
in a bar that opened in 2007.

1029
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:52,241
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

1030
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:55,183
Barging in on me Iike this?

1031
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:58,744
How can you have staged this?

1032
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,752
Because of a scumbag Iike you,

1033
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,794
there is no room for people
who Iove radio!

1034
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:08,697
Scumbag? Since when
were we on such informal terms?

1035
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,961
Put Shin Jina back
in her place.

1036
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:17,069
Hey, you!

1037
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:23,842
- Come on. Let's get you home.
- Bro, you just don't understand me.

1038
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:26,845
Go to sleep!

1039
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:31,186
Sorry about
my buddy and the fuss.

1040
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:34,553
He seems upset about something.

1041
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:37,792
Shall I play something cheerful?

1042
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,657
Be my guest.

1043
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:50,162
What is this song?
Wasn't it a massive hit?

1044
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:52,370
- Do you want some clues?
- Sure.

1045
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:54,165
The first of the firsts.

1046
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,511
Fairies forever.

1047
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:59,139
The beginning of the girl group
and the end.

1048
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:02,041
- It's Purple!
- Purple!

1049
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,186
Purple! Purple!
I remember.

1050
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,688
You remember
because you're an artist.

1051
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,452
I remember the dance.

1052
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,394
I used to know
the entire routine.

1053
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,362
- I know that dance, too.
- Go back to sleep!

1054
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:17,959
It's good, huh?

1055
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,401
This is a great evening.

1056
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,962
Shall I take you
for a drive around the town?

1057
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:24,765
Just go home.

1058
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:28,976
Yes, sir.

1059
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,068
- Mom.
- What do you want?

1060
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,170
You need help with anything?

1061
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,510
Well, that's a first?

1062
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,944
I was being nice, okay?

1063
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,938
How's work going?

1064
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:11,951
Not well.

1065
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,388
- Mom.
- Huh?

1066
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:16,357
Shall we have a drink?

1067
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,449
What's gotten into you?

1068
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:21,061
Coming up with
such a brilliant idea?

1069
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:23,257
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1070
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:34,163
You should always eat something
with your drinks.

1071
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:39,239
You get that from your dad.

1072
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:44,751
How is that producer of yours doing?
You didn't hear from him?

1073
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:49,245
It's good that he never calls.
We only used to fight all the time.

1074
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,956
Oh come on.

1075
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:57,098
We never got along.

1076
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:59,760
You are a spitting image of your dad.

1077
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:04,269
You still think about him?

1078
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:07,468
Sometimes.

1079
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,334
Still wait for him?

1080
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:16,384
When he comes back,

1081
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:20,789
I wanted to show him
what a great job I did raising you.

1082
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,154
Mom...

1083
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,758
Don't worry about me.
I'm okay.

1084
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:29,357
Believe me, darling.

1085
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:32,762
I believe you.

1086
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:42,375
Feel like crying tonight

1087
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:54,151
Our love sways
over the river of time

1088
01:24:55,290 --> 01:25:01,661
with my tears

1089
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:13,268
How long should I go on for...

1090
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:26,945
Wonderful Radio DJ
Jina's Birthday!

1091
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:39,858
You could have called me
to Iet me know.

1092
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:45,564
With the recent scandals,

1093
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:50,166
patients' guardians complainted
that it's bad for the children

1094
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:57,444
The incident on Iive show
and plagiarism scandal, you know.

1095
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:13,266
I asked your mother.

1096
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,959
She wouldn't tell
but I insisted.

1097
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:21,671
I guss I only Iooked at it
from my perspective.

1098
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,243
I should have stood by you.

1099
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:30,043
I'm sorry.

1100
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:37,757
Don't worry about it.
I'm okay, now.

1101
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:42,859
Not being able to do the show
and not being to able to sing.

1102
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,963
I don't blame it on anyone.

1103
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:55,071
You should sing.
I came to tell you that.

1104
01:26:57,178 --> 01:27:03,139
You said you finally know
what you want to sing about.

1105
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,252
Let's sing.

1106
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:28,009
You were the producer?

1107
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:30,378
Well, it's not confirmed yet.

1108
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:32,580
It doesn't feel right
in my heart.

1109
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,447
I haven't had the chance
to prepare myself.

1110
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:36,943
You got it for me!

1111
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:42,090
Free stuff always
brings me peace.

1112
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:46,857
Shin Jina, welcome to my world.
This is Dream Factory.

1113
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:55,963
Let's start.

1114
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,470
One two three four.

1115
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:08,738
?Lingering memories
?come back to me

1116
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:15,249
?You come back to me

1117
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:22,459
?although I left you,
?forgot about you

1118
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:27,402
?l poured out my heart

1119
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:30,705
?to love you, to hurt you

1120
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:35,665
?and to love you again

1121
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:40,281
?It's so bitter the memory

1122
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:45,548
?So bitter because I remember

1123
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,482
?because I miss it

1124
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:53,194
?l poured out my heart

1125
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:56,497
?to love you, to hurt you

1126
01:28:56,497 --> 01:29:01,662
?to love you again

1127
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:06,207
?It's so bitter the memory

1128
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:11,042
?So bitter because I remember

1129
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:14,539
?because I miss it

1130
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:18,486
I apologize sincerely.

1131
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:20,545
Rumy is all taken care of?

1132
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:25,093
I arranged for her to Ieave
the country for a few months.

1133
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:28,859
I thought I could kickstart
my debut ifl raise issues.

1134
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:34,860
Do your job right.

1135
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,066
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I did...

1136
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:42,167
- Get outta here.
- everything single-handedly

1137
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:49,639
and my label had nothing
to do with it.

1138
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:53,850
You got tons of trashy music
in your office.

1139
01:29:54,989 --> 01:30:00,895
Nice and stuffy in here.

1140
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,096
Juts cut to the chase.

1141
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:05,361
What's wrong with you?

1142
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:11,968
I Iearned a Iot
from your Iast visit.

1143
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:14,870
I'm only trying to help you.

1144
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:22,142
He's talking about the special show
commemorating 1 000th show.

1145
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:25,443
TV, It'II be aired Iive
on radio and TV.

1146
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:28,146
We'II fill up the Iineup
with Lee's boys and girls.

1147
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:36,097
That's a great idea.

1148
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,200
but I'II come up
with the final Iineup.

1149
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,503
Of course, you won't need to worry
about your boys and girls.

1150
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:46,269
Well, you're the producer in charge.

1151
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:51,435
It Iooks Iike you have
something up your sleeve.

1152
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:52,944
It's Shin Jina.

1153
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,749
Her name is cleared but...

1154
01:30:58,085 --> 01:30:59,387
isn't it too early
to make a come back?

1155
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:02,390
I'II present you
with a preliminary Iineup.

1156
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:04,756
Jae-hyeok! Jae-hyeok!

1157
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,662
Wait.

1158
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:24,042
You think it would hurt the station
more to Iose one good producer

1159
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:34,449
or an entire army of their
most popular hosts and DJs?

1160
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:40,051
Are you threatening me?

1161
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:45,856
I think so.

1162
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:56,933
Put Shin Jina on the Iineup.

1163
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,642
And hang this on the Iine, too.

1164
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:13,856
- Give me my cellphone?
- Here.

1165
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:16,397
Where is Yong-sik?

1166
01:32:16,397 --> 01:32:18,365
He had a call from Mr. Lee.

1167
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:20,801
He didn't update me
on the afternoon schedule.

1168
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,603
He'II be right back.

1169
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:27,768
How have you been, Mira?

1170
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:35,237
What are you doing here?

1171
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:40,388
You know the rumor
about my time in juvie.

1172
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:41,855
I don't want to hear about it.

1173
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:43,750
Well, it's not a rumor.

1174
01:32:44,692 --> 01:32:47,855
When I was in 1 3
I came back from school

1175
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:52,259
and my step father was beating
the hell out of mom again.

1176
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:57,066
I had to stop him somehow.

1177
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:05,940
And I realized
I had killed a man.

1178
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:13,348
On the night before our Iast concert,
a reporter told me he'd run the story.

1179
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,851
Jina said...

1180
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:23,457
That we can stop it
if we break up the group.

1181
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,167
Jina said she couldn't watch me
branded a murderer

1182
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,867
for the rest of my Iife.

1183
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:37,341
Why are you telling me this now?

1184
01:33:37,878 --> 01:33:41,644
I don't care. I gotta go.

1185
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:48,347
PIease don't hate her
so much.

1186
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,347
I said I wasn't interested.

1187
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,563
Your autographs, please?

1188
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:16,784
This is Shin Jina's
historical comeback album.

1189
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:18,342
Cherish it as a treasure.

1190
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:23,655
About the comeback broadcast
that I mentioned earlier.

1191
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:27,353
I'm not performing
on TV or radio.

1192
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:31,863
Wonderful Radio's 1 000th
special broadcast is coming up.

1193
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,765
I want that to be
your comeback stage.

1194
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:38,665
I don't think I can do it.

1195
01:34:39,206 --> 01:34:44,337
Why?
You brought the show this far.

1196
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:48,042
I would really Iike you
to be part of the show.

1197
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:53,547
I'm making an official request
as the producer of the show.

1198
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:55,847
PIease.

1199
01:34:57,191 --> 01:35:01,651
And, this is my present.
Open it when you get home.

1200
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:05,462
Shin Jina, the recording artist!

1201
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:08,703
I have a Iittle something
for you, too.

1202
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:09,863
Hey, that's uh...

1203
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:12,306
Don't flex your muscles on me.

1204
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:13,967
- Come on, man.
- There you go.

1205
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:16,811
That's okay.

1206
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:18,244
Come on.

1207
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:40,901
But I can't do it.

1208
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,003
What's the matter?
You promised me.

1209
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:45,406
- But, bro...
- Stop being a sissy.

1210
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:46,566
This doesn't feel right.

1211
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,876
Wait. Wait!

1212
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:58,143
?Love comes to you quietly

1213
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:05,448
?and makes your heart pound

1214
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:12,557
?The voice that I could no longer hear

1215
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:17,104
?l miss your voice so much

1216
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:19,470
I really can't do it.

1217
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,779
- Will she Iike it?
- Believe me.

1218
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,481
Moment's embarrassment
guarantees Iifetime of Iove.

1219
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:29,540
Let's go.

1220
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:37,056
Man, do I really need to do this?

1221
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:39,293
You promised.

1222
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:41,796
- Come on, man.
- What's wrong with you, man?

1223
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,058
I'II revenge you.

1224
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:44,899
You know I can't sing.

1225
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:46,867
Will you stop crying
Iike a Iittle girl?

1226
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:18,558
How about 'Thank you'?
Where is your manner?

1227
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:21,902
- Little brats...
- Hey!

1228
01:37:21,902 --> 01:37:24,063
Stop playing that crappy song.

1229
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:26,907
Don't you know
whose song this is?

1230
01:37:26,907 --> 01:37:28,272
Whose is it?

1231
01:37:28,809 --> 01:37:31,539
How do I explain this?

1232
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:34,140
First of the firsts.

1233
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:35,883
The beginning
of the girl band syndrome.

1234
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:36,941
And the end.

1235
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:41,088
Eternal fairies.
They don't even age that much.

1236
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:42,350
This the masterpiece of Purple,

1237
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:51,558
'You are My Angel'

1238
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,261
Let's get going, man.

1239
01:38:04,678 --> 01:38:07,545
Hello? Hi!

1240
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:12,853
Pardon?

1241
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:26,200
We Iove you, Jina.

1242
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,203
Shin Jina!

1243
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:31,364
You're the truth, Jina

1244
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:11,779
I saw the cue sheet.
You really have to push forward?

1245
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:16,944
Don't you know what Lee is Iike?
You'II end up hurt.

1246
01:39:20,587 --> 01:39:26,355
I'm going to make the show
that I want.

1247
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,458
I'm sorry.

1248
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:41,570
- Jina!
- Oh, Jina!

1249
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:48,482
- I missed you so much.
- How are you?

1250
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:49,949
You Iook good.

1251
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:52,286
Good job with the preparation.

1252
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:55,449
It's been so hard
since you Ieft.

1253
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:02,956
Come on, Mira.
They want you inside.

1254
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,767
Where did you get this?

1255
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:14,774
In the waiting room.

1256
01:40:15,309 --> 01:40:19,439
What difference is it going to make?
She's finished.

1257
01:40:36,196 --> 01:40:39,757
Is really performing
on the show tonight?

1258
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:44,264
Mr. Lee will flip out.

1259
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,582
- It's me.
- Hey, darling.

1260
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:58,244
- I'm going in now.
- You arrived early.

1261
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:02,389
- Listen.
- What is it, honey?

1262
01:41:02,389 --> 01:41:04,892
About Jina performing tonight.

1263
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:08,555
Don't worry about it.
It's all taken care of.

1264
01:41:08,796 --> 01:41:11,060
No, actually...

1265
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:12,499
Then what?

1266
01:41:12,499 --> 01:41:17,004
I don't care
whether she performs on stage.

1267
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:20,565
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly.

1268
01:41:20,808 --> 01:41:22,709
And this doesn't just concern you.

1269
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:24,778
This is about my pride.

1270
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:29,383
Even if Jina comes to the show,
she'll not singing on that stage. Okay?

1271
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:31,185
In-seok! Wait.

1272
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:33,949
Come on, we gotta go.

1273
01:41:40,894 --> 01:41:42,953
- Did you check the artists?
- Yes.

1274
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:45,965
Do you know
that Jina is here?

1275
01:41:47,901 --> 01:41:52,361
If you're happy and
you know it, smile, man.

1276
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:55,770
- Last commercial.
- Okay.

1277
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:01,347
One, two, go.

1278
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:10,857
Hi everyone,

1279
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:15,095
Wonderful Radio is celebrating
its 1 000th show tonight.

1280
01:42:15,095 --> 01:42:18,699
Thank you all for coming here to celebrate
with us this special moment.

1281
01:42:18,699 --> 01:42:21,301
Here with us tonight,
we have guests

1282
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:24,759
from "The Song I Sing to You"

1283
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:28,265
Lim Seul-gi! Lim Seul-gi!

1284
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:32,779
Wonderful Radio and wonderful Iife

1285
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:35,043
starts now.

1286
01:43:29,803 --> 01:43:31,464
I heard you released
a new album.

1287
01:43:31,905 --> 01:43:34,608
I should have sent you a congratulatory
tweet or something

1288
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:36,667
but I've been too busy.

1289
01:43:36,977 --> 01:43:39,079
Can you make it quick?

1290
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:40,981
I need to prepare
for my performance.

1291
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:42,539
What's the hurry?

1292
01:43:45,485 --> 01:43:47,646
When Purple split up,

1293
01:43:48,488 --> 01:43:52,254
I should have kept to you
no matter what.

1294
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:57,352
Mira is perfect
except for the guts

1295
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:00,059
which you have.

1296
01:44:01,802 --> 01:44:06,406
In this business, you need the guts to go
on stage even at the cost of your producer.

1297
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:08,567
Mira Iacks that quality.

1298
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:15,640
What did you say?
Whose neck is on the Iine?

1299
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:19,950
Your producer, Lee Jae-hyeok.

1300
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:21,554
Jina!

1301
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:30,359
You have a very tall friend.
I'II Iook forward to your show.

1302
01:44:37,504 --> 01:44:46,640
? I rememberyour face
from when you first came to me

1303
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:56,847
? You touched my heart
and it stood broken since

1304
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:04,898
Jae-hyeok, it's Jina!

1305
01:45:04,898 --> 01:45:07,901
Hurry!
Come on, now.

1306
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:10,165
What about her?

1307
01:45:21,281 --> 01:45:24,546
Tell me what happened?

1308
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:28,348
Why didn't you tell me
what was at stake on this show?

1309
01:45:28,789 --> 01:45:31,849
Did you think about
how I would feel?

1310
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:34,456
I can't play this gig.

1311
01:45:35,896 --> 01:45:37,261
Are you running away?

1312
01:45:42,602 --> 01:45:45,867
Don't you think about everyone
in the audience who is waiting for you?

1313
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:50,065
There are people supporting you
waiting for your song.

1314
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:53,937
Breaking up of the band,
PIagiarism scandal...

1315
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:59,946
You think you can only help others
by sacrificing yourself?

1316
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:12,658
Sing.

1317
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:15,568
For yourself.

1318
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:19,869
And for me.

1319
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:37,290
? I'll love you always

1320
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:42,896
? I'll love you like this moment

1321
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:47,663
? More than anyone in the world

1322
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:08,252
Hi, mom.

1323
01:47:08,388 --> 01:47:11,050
Did you eat?

1324
01:47:12,993 --> 01:47:14,294
Not yet.

1325
01:47:14,294 --> 01:47:17,752
You gotta eat
ifyou're gonna sing.

1326
01:47:18,698 --> 01:47:24,004
I'll be listening to you
from here with daddy.

1327
01:47:24,004 --> 01:47:27,667
So, don't be too nervous.
Just do your thing, okay?

1328
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:32,134
Answer me, silly girl!

1329
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:38,841
Come home and have beer
with me later, okay?

1330
01:47:40,086 --> 01:47:42,289
Sure.
- What?

1331
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:45,156
- I said 'Okay'!
- Go, my girl!

1332
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:05,679
?l only kept in my heart

1333
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:06,839
Mira, you ready?

1334
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:18,552
?Yes, I loved you

1335
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:29,066
We'II have the Iast guest of part.

1336
01:48:34,107 --> 01:48:37,543
We can't talk about Wonderful Radio
without mentioning this person.

1337
01:48:37,978 --> 01:48:43,541
She was with you from the very
first show till not Iong ago.

1338
01:49:07,407 --> 01:49:08,374
Jina!

1339
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:17,243
At the heart of Wonderful Radio

1340
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:19,286
and the former Ieader of Purple,

1341
01:49:19,286 --> 01:49:22,449
Give it up for Shin Jina!

1342
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:44,239
Hi everyone! It's so great to see you
again on Wonderful Radio.

1343
01:49:44,377 --> 01:49:46,242
I'm Shin Jina.

1344
01:49:53,687 --> 01:49:57,646
While I was in Purple and
presenting Wonderful Radio

1345
01:49:58,391 --> 01:50:04,762
I said "I Iove you" and "Thank you" a Iot.

1346
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:09,467
But, that was all in the script.

1347
01:50:10,203 --> 01:50:12,569
My heart wasn't really in it.

1348
01:50:13,006 --> 01:50:15,372
The reason I'm here again is

1349
01:50:16,977 --> 01:50:24,042
because now I feel
that I can really say

1350
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:26,844
I Iove you and "Thank you"
with my heart.

1351
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:32,054
To me, Wonderful Radio was Iove.

1352
01:50:32,592 --> 01:50:34,457
After I Ieft the show Iike that,

1353
01:50:34,995 --> 01:50:40,456
I missed it so much.
I missed you so much.

1354
01:50:41,601 --> 01:50:42,863
Everyone,

1355
01:50:45,005 --> 01:50:48,964
Thank you.
I Iove you.

1356
01:50:54,280 --> 01:51:00,241
I'II sing my new song, "Again".
Thank you.

1357
01:51:12,799 --> 01:51:13,857
Where are you going?

1358
01:51:15,602 --> 01:51:17,365
It's a Iive show.

1359
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:48,463
? When darkness drapes over,
the stories offorgotten dreams

1360
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:57,239
? songs I put aside come to me

1361
01:51:57,377 --> 01:52:04,840
? like tiny lights,
pieces of thoughts

1362
01:52:05,985 --> 01:52:09,045
? hang over the cloud

1363
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:15,350
? and shine down on me

1364
01:52:16,796 --> 01:52:22,962
? Tears and lies

1365
01:52:23,903 --> 01:52:28,169
? and feelings I couldn 't get go

1366
01:52:28,508 --> 01:52:35,744
? all the times I tried
and all the people

1367
01:52:38,785 --> 01:52:47,056
? I'm letting them go
here and now

1368
01:52:47,894 --> 01:52:58,065
I poured out my heart
but that wasn't sincere

1369
01:52:58,204 --> 01:53:03,073
- So here I go again
- Turn off the Iights!

1370
01:53:04,878 --> 01:53:07,180
What are you doing?

1371
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:09,842
Director!

1372
01:53:10,884 --> 01:53:15,446
How can you do this to me?

1373
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:19,152
From today on,

1374
01:53:20,193 --> 01:53:22,457
I'II walking out with
all my hosts from your station.

1375
01:53:24,998 --> 01:53:27,159
- Pull them out.
- Pull them out!

1376
01:53:30,703 --> 01:53:31,805
Excuse me?

1377
01:53:31,805 --> 01:53:33,170
I said pull them out.

1378
01:53:33,606 --> 01:53:38,543
There are tons of people
who are dying to working with us.

1379
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:45,240
Go on. I'm boycotting
all your artists from this station.

1380
01:53:47,387 --> 01:53:49,389
Well, that's not what I meant...

1381
01:53:49,389 --> 01:53:50,947
PIease Ieave this room.

1382
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:54,055
- Director! Bro!
- PIease step outside.

1383
01:53:54,294 --> 01:53:59,357
You seem to have misunderstood me.
I'II wait for you at the coffee shop.

1384
01:54:01,201 --> 01:54:03,362
What an idiot!

1385
01:54:03,903 --> 01:54:11,742
? I'm going to sing my song

1386
01:54:16,783 --> 01:54:24,849
? I'm letting it all go
here and now

1387
01:54:25,792 --> 01:54:35,963
I poured out my heart
but I wasn't sincere

1388
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:45,838
So here I go again
I'm starting over again

1389
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:56,753
? For me who will shine
like the stars

1390
01:54:57,991 --> 01:55:06,456
? I'm letting it all go
here and now

1391
01:55:34,794 --> 01:55:36,261
I've been Iooking all over for you.

1392
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:44,861
What's our relationship?

1393
01:55:46,506 --> 01:55:49,475
Aren't we producer and host?

1394
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:53,746
Yes.

1395
01:55:56,082 --> 01:56:00,542
What kind of a producer sticks
his neck out for his host?

1396
01:56:10,596 --> 01:56:14,760
This is from the director.

1397
01:56:18,104 --> 01:56:19,969
And I got something for you too.

1398
01:57:06,285 --> 01:57:10,390
On the house beat,
we'II add an elemnet of rock.

1399
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:12,654
And shouting!

1400
01:57:14,093 --> 01:57:15,060
What do you think?

1401
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:19,098
Not very hot, huh?
I thought so too.

1402
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:23,803
I have a heart-ringing ballad for you.

1403
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:27,407
Listen to the intro.

1404
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:29,409
Ji-yeong begged me for it

1405
01:57:29,409 --> 01:57:32,879
but I kept it aside for you.

1406
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:34,480
3 minutes!
Just give me 3 minutes.

1407
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:42,989
This is a hiphop remake of
Lee Mija's mega hit, "Camellia Girl."

1408
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:46,292
This bit here...
Feel the beat?

1409
01:57:46,292 --> 01:57:51,355
200 backup singers with short pants
going "Camellia girl"~~

1410
01:57:52,398 --> 01:57:56,562
It gave me goose bumps.

1411
01:57:56,803 --> 01:57:58,905
- Good job.
- Don't go.

1412
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:01,066
Jina. PIease!

1413
01:58:02,408 --> 01:58:05,078
Hi, this is Kim Chang-wan
from Beautiful Morning.

1414
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:07,780
- I have a real special song for you.
- Hi, I'm Park So-hyeon.

1415
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:10,783
The next song is
rather a special song.

1416
01:58:10,783 --> 01:58:14,087
Bouncing back
from the plagiarism accusation,

1417
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,288
the former leader of Purple and

1418
01:58:15,288 --> 01:58:18,891
beloved host
of Wonderful Radio

1419
01:58:18,891 --> 01:58:21,794
She overcame hardships
and released a new album.

1420
01:58:21,794 --> 01:58:23,896
I know what that's like.

1421
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:24,954
I'm sure you do.

1422
01:58:25,898 --> 01:58:29,102
She wrote all songs by herself.

1423
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:30,103
That's incredible.

1424
01:58:30,103 --> 01:58:32,205
Send her your support and love.

1425
01:58:32,205 --> 01:58:36,369
and show her the power of listeners
and lover of radio.
