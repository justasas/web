1
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,190
Film is based on the motifs of
N. V. GOGOL's story 'VIY'

2
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,192
<i>Close your eyes, don't move and pray!</i>

3
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:56,590
<i>Fear the sight of Viy, the ancient God,
who dwells in eternal darkness under ground.</i>

4
00:00:57,192 --> 00:01:01,247
<i>His eyelids are roots,
coming to the surface.</i>

5
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:06,072
<i>If a man looks in his eyes,
he will die instantly!</i>

6
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:11,125
<i>So speak the old ones.
So spoke their ancestors.</i>

7
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:20,002
<i>From the time when both Earth and Gods were
still young, this tradition lives in the souls of Slavs.</i>

8
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:23,258
<i>Long before the arrival of Christianity.</i>

9
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:28,174
<i>So overlaps present
religion and ancient traditions.</i>

10
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:37,476
<i>As on St. Ivan's day (Midsummer's day) young girls release
downstream wreaths of flowers with burning candles.</i>

11
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:48,741
<i>If a young man takes the wreath,
It was believed that he was her destiny.</i>

12
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:06,102
<i>And flames sail through the darkness...</i>

13
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:09,855
<i>And that will never end.</i>

14
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:40,296
Miss, sister, where are you?

15
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:51,397
Miss!

16
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:58,898
Where are you, Miss?

17
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:03,337
<b>VIY</b>

18
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:14,098
Sin has
arrived in our lands!

19
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:18,820
- What happened? - My sin
didn't die. - Speak up already!

20
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:23,036
Again, on St. Ivan's day
monsters appeared .

21
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,052
Tonight someone has disappeared.

22
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,302
Daughter!

23
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:42,653
Who did this?
Who did this?

24
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:48,318
I told you to
have no business with the devils ...

25
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:51,219
Who did this?

26
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:56,137
- Let me take her confession.
- Do not let anyone read prayers for me.

27
00:04:57,642 --> 00:05:04,556
Send someone to bring seminarian Khoma.
Let him pray for my sinful soul three nights.

28
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:07,032
He knows who ...

29
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:19,733
- Nastusya, are you okay?
- Move away!

30
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:22,675
Daughter... What's with you?

31
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:26,350
There, we invoked misery!

32
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,453
It deprived them of reason ...

33
00:05:54,738 --> 00:06:00,381
You're good, holy man,
known for godpleasing deeds.

34
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:06,806
- It's possible she have heard of you.
- For me? God be with you, pan Sotnik! What are you saying?

35
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,163
This was ment to be.

36
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:16,099
It may not be appropriate, but I must
say that I didn't fast on Maundy Thursday.

37
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:25,633
- Today you have to start with a prayer.
- You need a deacon, or a good cantiniere.

38
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:35,163
My voice does not serve me,
I myself do not know why ... Forgive me, Lord!

39
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:40,433
All that my dove wanted of me, I shall fulfill!

40
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,658
You know what the whip is?

41
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:52,691
- In larger quantities it is unbearable.
- If you do not do this, you will not be able to sit.

42
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:56,970
If you do this, I'll give you 1000 chervons.

43
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:02,271
Pan Sotnik...

44
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:25,166
Damn ... Why do I fear?

45
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:32,021
No one from the outside can not enter.
Nor will she come back from the other world.

46
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:37,522
After all, when I read the prayers,
I'll be safe whatever happens.

47
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:43,223
To proceed...

48
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:05,874
Nothing is sacred to you , sir! And you miss are giving in to sin, in your father's house

49
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:10,399
- With a common teacher! - I am king's courtier, not a common teacher.

50
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:16,324
- Expert in geography and cartography!
- Do not waste your words, charlatan!

51
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:20,742
You've infected half of Europe
with your apples!

52
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:26,734
- Dad, I love him! - Love him? Him
who wears such indecent pants ?

53
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:32,240
- I have plans and will become famous in the future.
- Plans to marry my daughter? - No.

54
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:38,165
- What do you mean, no? - Of course I'll marry you.
Not just now, but in the near future.

55
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:42,803
In my opinion you do not have
any future. Get him!

56
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:48,119
Jonathan, run!

57
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:56,685
-Run, Jonathan, run!
- Your dead mother has better future!

58
00:10:01,192 --> 00:10:07,124
- Let the dogs at him! - Honey, I
I love you! - I love you too, darling! Trust me!

59
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:21,244
Don't forget the birds.

60
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:41,258
<i>Dear Miss Dudly, I deeply
apologize for my quick departure.</i>

61
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:48,174
<i>I find it hard to admit, but your father is
right. I have lost my estate.</i>

62
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:53,492
<i>But I have not spent it on wind,
as many believe, but on my invention.</i>

63
00:10:53,724 --> 00:11:00,928
<i>It will make a revolution in cartography
and will show people the real image of our world.</i>

64
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:06,774
<i>I decided that this grandiose project
starts from our beloved Greenwich.</i>

65
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:14,139
<i>In my  measurements, I took it as a starting point.
Our town will become known throughout the world.</i>

66
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:18,826
<i>Everywhere on Earth time will be determined by it.
This is my dream.</i>

67
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,461
<i>Dream that will come true
only if you believe in me.</i>

68
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:31,908
<i>Of my adventures I will notify you
coded according to the method of Leonardo Da Vinci.</i>

69
00:11:32,262 --> 00:11:36,494
<i>So those who are not intended will not read them.</i>

70
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:44,172
<i>I love you and I do not want you to be subject of
gossip. I will prove to everyone that they are wrong.</i>

71
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:49,467
<i>Reports will be brought to you by carrier pigeons</i>

72
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:57,633
<i>So I shall feel you close, feeling which
will warm my heart in difficult moments .</i>

73
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:12,602
You're holy man,
known for godpleasing deeds.

74
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:20,177
All your wisdom serves the church.

75
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:27,504
See if Khoma is doing everything properly.
You know the best of it.

76
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,032
Dorosh is watching the theologian.

77
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:37,277
Here is a thousand chervons. Take!

78
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,281
Much obliged!

79
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:47,385
- This can build an entire monastery!
- You will give this to Khoma.

80
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,704
Go, go! Prepare everything for the eulogy.

81
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:07,443
- We should hurry. - What? - To bury the mistress.
It's third day, there's no use.

82
00:13:07,707 --> 00:13:12,259
I, of course, trust the master.
But, those attacked by the witch...

83
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:18,758
Paisiy!

84
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,944
- What's that?
- For Khoma. Pay from Sotnik.

85
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:31,310
I have never held so many
in my hands ...

86
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:34,033
The key!

87
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:55,244
Run...

88
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:21,030
This place is cursed...

89
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:28,232
This place is cursed! There is no holy spirit here!
God's sacred place is desecrated!

90
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:33,789
- There can be no more service here.
Nail the windows and doors! - The witch...

91
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,390
Look! Money!

92
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:44,149
- This place is cursed!
- Good, good that it's cursed...

93
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:51,040
We share? Evenly?

94
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:21,508
Don't go there! It's cursed!

95
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:33,698
Don't go there, pan Sotnik...
Place is cursed! Cursed!

96
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:38,956
I don't understand. What are you talking about?

97
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:52,430
Not there! Don't go there!

98
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,082
If you don't think of yourself, think of the people!
How will they do without a leader?

99
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,193
Do not put sin on your soul!

100
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:27,772
- Where do we go now?
- I said you can't go this way!

101
00:16:28,996 --> 00:16:32,608
- Don't you have any conscience?
- Do you have a mother?

102
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:38,426
Kill him...

103
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,643
In the name of the Father , the Son...

104
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,878
And the Holy spirit...

105
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:06,869
Son Christ let us close the circle so
the unholy one wouldn't crawl up to our homes ...

106
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,318
We must suffer and pray ...

107
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,204
Lord, help me protect
my children from the unholy one!

108
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:27,178
Let them believe that in the sealed
old church miracle will  happen!

109
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:30,017
Help me!

110
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:39,032
Show them what will happen to them,
If they do not listen!

111
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:32,779
<i>Today is the first day of April.</i>

112
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:38,074
<i>Spring has probably already arrived in Greenwich. </i>

113
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,721
<i>I imagine you at the window.
In front of you is a flower garden.</i>

114
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:51,256
<i>The spring sun caress your hair ... <i>
- Thank you, nanny!</i></i>

115
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:58,522
- Shame on you!
- Shut up, witch!

116
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:04,809
- Carrier pigeons, isn't it?
- Dad, look at me ...

117
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,115
Oh, Lord...

118
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,472
I'll kill him!

119
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:30,694
<i>It's been exactly one year
since the beginning of my journey.</i>

120
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:35,230
<i>Luck, that followed me,
abandoned me.</i>

121
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:40,234
<i>I swerved out of the way, that's clear.
I have not eaten for several days.</i>

122
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:44,811
<i>I have no more money
to continue my journey.</i>

123
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:34,075
- Don't shoot! - Who are you?
- Theologians from the Kiev seminary.

124
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:40,543
- Food ... Food ... You have any?
- You want to eat? - Yes. I want.

125
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:45,488
Why didn't you say so ...
Here, help yourself!

126
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:49,312
- You hid it? - I?
- From me!

127
00:20:53,018 --> 00:21:00,209
- Oi! - What do you want? Move that away!
That's not food, that's snack! - Here!

128
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,638
This one, for friendship

129
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:11,333
- Gentleman, then, is a scientist?
- Yes, yes, a scientist. - Us also.

130
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:15,989
I am rhetor Gorobets.
And this is theologian Khalyava.

131
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:20,592
- City, town ... Where is it?
- There's one nearby. Hutor.

132
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:22,598
Hutor?

133
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:30,900
- I would not advise even the devil to go there.
- Why? - Last spring, we lost a friend there.

134
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:35,157
- Scientist? - Yes, scientist.
Philosopher.  Khoma Brut.

135
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,504
Last year I, Khoma and Khalyava were coming home
through that place.

136
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:49,280
Because of the fog, or, devils led us astray,
we got lost.

137
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:54,066
- Panas, where are you going?
- Sorry, Taras, but duty is duty.

138
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:04,285
- For the commemoration?
- We drank.
- For the soul? - That we can.

139
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:16,120
For the soul...

140
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:24,673
- Who's there? - Grandma, let us spend the night.
- A lot of people here, where to put you?

141
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,318
Fine!

142
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,393
I'll let you.

143
00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:00,091
Listen, grandma, my stomach churns
like ungreased wheel.

144
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:05,457
What does he want?
I have nothing.

145
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:21,726
Remember what she said?

146
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:26,020
I'll sell you green beans!

147
00:23:33,307 --> 00:23:36,078
Crooked old woman

148
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,412
- And her nose is not pretty. He hands are
dirty. - All old women witches.

149
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:49,731
- Ones on the markets are really witches.
- From the weariness we dozed off ...

150
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:55,497
Listen, granny, it's fasting days.

151
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,311
I'm that kind of guy, not even for a
1000 chervons, would I break my fasting...

152
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:05,128
No, granny, no...
You're old, old...

153
00:25:53,406 --> 00:25:59,308
The old woman was actually the young mistress,
but she was a witch. I know for sure.

154
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:20,047
My teacher Isaac Newton discovered the law
of gravity and that free flight is impossible.

155
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:25,607
But free fall you have as much as you want.

156
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,074
You're saying we're wrong?

157
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,512
Fact, colleague! Argument

158
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:57,519
If I'm lying,
may I fall down into the ground!

159
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:06,683
Laugh if you will,
but after that we saw Khoma no more.

160
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:18,184
- Get lost reprobates! Devil's seed!
- What did we do, mister?

161
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,674
Your friend Khoma let a witch near him
and other unholy forces. That's how he died.

162
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:29,297
- Now he's on the other world. - Dead?
You lie! - By God, he died!

163
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,507
Let me taste a bit of that!

164
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:45,504
- The best, yes?
- Not bad.

165
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:51,462
Devil's works are happening in Hutor.
They were seeing the Lord.

166
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:54,646
He said Khoma was afraid!

167
00:27:55,246 --> 00:28:00,088
- He lies. - What if he's not lying?
-It has long been on my mind ...

168
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:08,230
How is it that he's just gone?
Where could have he disappear ?

169
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,952
He said, he was terrified by the witch and he died...

170
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:16,097
Maybe we should go back to  Hutor?

171
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,031
Where are you going?

172
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,204
I know why he died.

173
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:28,096
Because he got scared! If he haven't get
scared, nothing would have happened.

174
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:30,040
Wait!

175
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:37,506
He should've only cross himself,
Spat on her tail and that's it!

176
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:42,191
Then nothing would have happened.
I'm sure!

177
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:57,653
What about me?

178
00:29:02,763 --> 00:29:05,597
Illustrious man was Khoma.

179
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:09,170
And noble.

180
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:12,833
But he's gone.

181
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:17,548
Unclean spirit! Satan!

182
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:21,943
Lord, what do we do...

183
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:46,064
- Strange sound?
- Exactly, strange!

184
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:52,240
- And you claim it's a monster? And it has
nine horns? - Seven horns. Seven!

185
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,234
Stop, stop!

186
00:29:56,667 --> 00:30:00,378
You go on ahead,
we're not going there!

187
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:09,529
Hey, colleagues!

188
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,312
Ridiculous story...

189
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,337
Wait, where are you going?

190
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:39,186
- What the hell was that, lads?
- Repent!

191
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:05,829
This is a sign! Emissary of the devil
broke through the circle!

192
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:12,498
What kind of emissary of hell is he
when he got his feet so muddy?

193
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:21,340
He doesn't look like no emissary.

194
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,441
Pan Sotnik...

195
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:49,942
Nobody inside.

196
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:02,350
Misfortune!

197
00:35:04,362 --> 00:35:06,995
Emissary of hell.

198
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,432
- Jonathan Green?
- Jonathan Green, yes!

199
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:20,876
Yes, Jonathan Green.
Scientist, cartographer ...

200
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:25,131
Subject of Her Majesty
Queen of England.

201
00:35:29,747 --> 00:35:32,380
I salute you...

202
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:38,944
All those stranded on our shores...
All have fever!

203
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:48,374
I steered the spyglass toward the fire.

204
00:35:48,616 --> 00:35:57,457
I saw the savages well. I was sure
they are baking their terrible meal of human flesh.

205
00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:59,816
What are you reading?

206
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:05,060
Latest bestseller of Mr. Defoe about
the adventures of Robinson Crusoe.

207
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:09,686
So many great writers and
you pick to read this?

208
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:16,510
- And what is this, madam?
- Give it back! - From him?

209
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:24,277
I asked you to break up with him! I don't want
anything reminding me of him in my house.

210
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:30,982
Quiet, dad! You forget that he's the father of my
child and perhaps is now in grave danger!

211
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:36,800
- Surrounded by savages and pirates on a
desert island! - Savages? Island?

212
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:41,596
What island? This is
the largest continent on Earth!

213
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:46,801
And your no good cartographer Jonathan
Green, is located in the center of that continent!

214
00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:51,235
- Continent?
- Yes! Silly girl ... An island!

215
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:57,254
Excuse me sir ...

216
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:01,488
It is very important ...

217
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,881
- Wheel. - Wheel? - Yes.
- Our blacksmith makes such mechanisms.

218
00:37:10,286 --> 00:37:16,008
Come on. He invented a
vodka distiller. Clean as a whistle!

219
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:21,525
- Although I do not drink, of course.
- I know what vodka is.

220
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:26,451
- It is mechanics ... mechanism.
- Oh, it's quite simple!

221
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,228
No, he does not drink!

222
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:40,220
He stoped drinking a year ago, when his daughter became
mute. Now he sits in the smithy and contrive.

223
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:45,269
- He forged sabers his whole life.
- Sabers? - Sabers.

224
00:37:53,713 --> 00:38:01,734
-  Is there anyone there? Taras, It's me!
Foreigner is here for a visit. - Visit?

225
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,033
This is the foreigner coach.

226
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:12,006
Moves and steers on it's own.
No need for a coachman.

227
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:19,874
- Like that's something! We can do that too.
- No, no... It's Dutch master.

228
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:22,988
Dutch, you say ...

229
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:33,098
And what does this look like,
pan scientist?

230
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:45,986
- The flying machine of Leonardo da Vinci!
- I do not know who that is, but it can fly.

231
00:38:46,262 --> 00:38:48,933
How do you land?

232
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:54,627
Pan scientist, you'll be
my guest. That is the custom.

233
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:59,983
Put yourself where there's space
and do not worry about your coach.

234
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:10,296
- Why do you want the scientist here?
- That's not why I called.

235
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:17,348
Almost a year passed since my dove flew away from us.
Tomorrow, I want funeral service in the old church.

236
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:21,665
I'll order the boys and
they'll clean the road in a second.

237
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:28,168
- You said nothing, I heard nothing! Forget it!
- I waited 9 days, then 40.

238
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:33,825
- Almost a year. How much more?
-You shouldn't be waiting, but praying earnestly.

239
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:40,382
Something bothers me.
What did you saw there, last year?

240
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:08,363
Petrus! Petrus!

241
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:13,475
- Yes, pan Sotnik?
- Tell me, what is drawn here?

242
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,282
Map of some area.

243
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:22,107
Get me this... scientist.

244
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,312
But quietly!

245
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:53,157
Sorry... Hello, do you speak english?

246
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:59,154
What's your name?

247
00:41:18,082 --> 00:41:20,315
She is mute.

248
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:31,332
What devil brought him so gentle...
This is for back scrubbing.

249
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:40,041
Your brother scientist likes these things.

250
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:25,477
Decided to fly far, pan scientist?

251
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:33,425
- What's the problem?
- Pan Sotnik is calling for you.

252
00:42:33,877 --> 00:42:36,039
But, quietly!

253
00:42:41,605 --> 00:42:46,348
Nastusya... Nastusya!
I love you, but you're avoiding me!

254
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,622
You know how hard it is for me to not be able to see you
but you're letting me suffer for a year already

255
00:42:53,437 --> 00:43:03,419
When I saw shadows of horses in flames,
I thought... we all did... in fear: I repent!

256
00:43:09,373 --> 00:43:11,495
My wheel...

257
00:43:18,052 --> 00:43:20,874
Spirid! Do you smell that?

258
00:43:23,097 --> 00:43:27,328
All women are witches,
the older, the bigger!

259
00:43:31,314 --> 00:43:33,716
It's faster by river.

260
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:42,525
Clean as a whistle!

261
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:51,763
Pan Sotnik... The scientist.

262
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:58,208
- Cartographer, do you believe in God?
- What can I tell you? I'm a scientist.

263
00:44:00,323 --> 00:44:05,435
- Then, you don't believe in the devil, either?
- I don't. - I thought so.

264
00:44:06,669 --> 00:44:13,831
This I need! The church to be drawn on the map
and all my land be on the map.

265
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:19,877
Map? I need time.

266
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:23,456
1000 chervons.

267
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,901
- What did pan Sotnik want?
- He asked about the cursed place.

268
00:44:33,076 --> 00:44:40,788
- Same old tune. - He says that
his boys will clear the path no time.

269
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:46,807
I'd like to see those lads
that dare go to the cursed place.

270
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,752
No such heroes!

271
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:52,776
And the foreigner?

272
00:45:10,012 --> 00:45:12,284
This is advance.

273
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:17,117
- I need an assistant.
- You'll get an assistant.

274
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:23,752
Start from the old church,
But not a word to anyone!

275
00:45:24,907 --> 00:45:27,600
Pan Sotnik, hurry!

276
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,631
Hurry, pan scientist!

277
00:45:31,954 --> 00:45:37,495
- You have to forgive him. - What happened?
- Since his daughter's death he's not quite himself.

278
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,632
People think that the Mistress was actually a witch.
Her soul is wandering the swamp and can not find peace.

279
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:49,088
That's why Khoma was brought to church.
It's closed in the circle so the unclean force can't come out.

280
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,785
The bravest of the Cossacks do not go there.

281
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:03,736
Come on, go, go!

282
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,241
I need facts.

283
00:46:23,555 --> 00:46:27,737
Don't tell anyone you
went to see pan Sotnik.

284
00:46:35,937 --> 00:46:39,898
- Maybe Paisiy is right?
- We'll see.

285
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,761
- Where is the scientist?
- Here he is!

286
00:46:52,762 --> 00:47:01,762
-Sit down everyone. - Pour that good vodka
of yours to pan scientist. He never tasted such.

287
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:11,853
Cheers lads! May we be alive and well,
and may all be well.

288
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:25,021
- For which area are you scientist?
- How many scientists have you met in your life?

289
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:31,229
- I, for example, know those who watch
the stars. - Where's the science in that?

290
00:47:31,552 --> 00:47:38,144
Those of whom I speak,
watch the stars through the glass!

291
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:44,645
Taras, bring more vodka.

292
00:47:44,937 --> 00:47:50,359
There are those who don't look at the stars.
One came here. Also scientist.

293
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:54,773
- Philosopher!
- Khoma Brut. Brutus.

294
00:48:06,156 --> 00:48:11,913
And you, pan scientist,
how do you know of him?

295
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:20,305
- I've heard of him. Everyone knows such a person .
- Who would not know a celebrity.

296
00:48:27,528 --> 00:48:35,862
We were ordered by pan Sotnik to bring
the theologian Khoma Brut.

297
00:48:56,406 --> 00:48:59,409
You're trying in vain!

298
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,903
- From here you can not escape.
- What a beautiful scenery!

299
00:49:06,286 --> 00:49:09,059
To fish here!

300
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,983
Or hunt!

301
00:49:13,594 --> 00:49:17,237
I think there's birds also,
in these woods.

302
00:49:17,867 --> 00:49:25,811
Fruit that you can dry and sell in town.
Even better is to make vodka of it!

303
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:31,651
Because with vodka made of fruit,
no beer can compare!

304
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:41,587
Why did pan Sotnik chose him for such an
important job? He didn't have courage for it.

305
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:50,363
It is known that, when pan conceives something,
Even the most educated person can't see why!

306
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,194
We took Khoma to the church.

307
00:49:55,135 --> 00:50:00,447
- Let me go, lads!
- I remember that dogs were barking.

308
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:43,803
What kind of Cossack am I,
If I'm afraid?

309
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:47,877
I could smell tobacco a bit.

310
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:58,317
Good tobacco....

311
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:09,651
What a terrible, radiant beauty.

312
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:24,879
- Where is that church? - Why do
you care , pan scientist?

313
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:35,769
- Never mind. - This is the most important
thing in Hutor. With this, draw a circle!

314
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:40,044
- And don't be afraid of the devil
- Not even a witch.

315
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:49,375
- They say that every witch has a small tail.
- Daughter, where are you going? In the swamp?

316
00:54:51,178 --> 00:54:55,629
- I told you not to go!
- These are just stories and prejudices.

317
00:54:55,912 --> 00:55:01,806
Maybe you, in Europe, have no witches.
But here, in Kiev, all women are witches.

318
00:55:07,945 --> 00:55:15,557
It's obvious that pan scientist did not understood. Girl
sinned with the devil and became a witch!

319
00:55:17,074 --> 00:55:21,566
- Yavtukh, he drinks?
- His skills, he can't drink away.

320
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,753
Enough!

321
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:06,411
You, why did you interrupt us?
Let me go!

322
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:32,986
Where to, scientist?
Don't insult the lads! Sit, drink...

323
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,603
- But, what of Khoma?
Facts! - Evidence!

324
00:56:40,957 --> 00:56:44,531
Here they are!
This is my evidence.

325
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:50,537
I secretly watched with one eye.

326
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,692
Listen carefully...

327
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:04,650
Only the first time is scary.

328
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:16,366
Or, maybe, it is not so scary.
Not scary at all.

329
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:21,167
Not scary.

330
00:58:17,142 --> 00:58:22,925
I should illuminate the whole church,
to be as bright as day.

331
01:02:59,622 --> 01:03:02,074
He's under the table!

332
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,880
That hurted my ear.

333
01:03:08,271 --> 01:03:10,543
Help me!

334
01:03:19,802 --> 01:03:22,415
He wants to escape!

335
01:04:04,517 --> 01:04:07,039
I can't see anything!

336
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:13,817
Do not let him take the chalk!
Turn around!

337
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:19,573
Do not let him reach it!

338
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:27,074
Do not let him take the chalk!

339
01:04:51,103 --> 01:04:53,785
I can't see him!

340
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:02,244
Where is he?

341
01:05:10,845 --> 01:05:12,845
Grandma Ganna!

342
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:19,445
The mistress!

343
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:28,210
Where are you?

344
01:05:30,812 --> 01:05:38,141
Call Viy!!
Viy!!

345
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:28,029
Raise my eyelids!

346
01:06:43,043 --> 01:06:49,781
Here, he's yours now!

347
01:06:58,782 --> 01:07:02,882
Your soul is eternal!

348
01:07:03,494 --> 01:07:08,971
If you save your soul,
I will leave you among the living!

349
01:07:56,086 --> 01:08:02,119
You saw how many of them are there?
They live in people and everywhere.

350
01:08:02,593 --> 01:08:07,358
Only with the cross you can
defend from them.

351
01:08:07,758 --> 01:08:10,220
But there's no cross in you.

352
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:14,632
It's easy if you're dressed in clean clothes
and spend your entire life in the circle.

353
01:08:14,884 --> 01:08:21,177
The mistress has chosen you. She invited
Viy personally, so you would come out of the circle.

354
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:27,035
You saw his eyes and lived!
You have a strong heart.

355
01:08:27,327 --> 01:08:30,471
Help the mistress find peace.

356
01:08:31,301 --> 01:08:33,054
Help her!

357
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:47,013
Pan scientist, pan Sotnik is angry.
You took the money, and ...

358
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:50,279
I have to go.

359
01:09:11,491 --> 01:09:13,033
What?

360
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:17,645
- The high place, where is it?
- The old church. There!

361
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:22,402
What?

362
01:09:22,702 --> 01:09:25,205
Let's go, Peter!

363
01:09:46,758 --> 01:09:48,558
Give it here!

364
01:09:49,058 --> 01:09:51,680
How is our scientist?

365
01:09:53,863 --> 01:09:57,997
He picked up his things and left.

366
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:07,575
Devil's work! They left the protection circle!
She saw. Speak!

367
01:10:08,878 --> 01:10:13,840
- Lord, what will happen with us?
- Go and alarm the people!

368
01:10:14,441 --> 01:10:20,941
- Listen, it looks like you got 200
more? - How is that possible? - How, how ...

369
01:10:24,723 --> 01:10:32,215
Pan Sotnik asked about them. Have you seen,
he asks, a 1000 chervons I sent for Khoma?

370
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,595
I saw, I saw all.

371
01:10:36,355 --> 01:10:38,828
Then, to the church!

372
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:44,643
Consider it, secret from confession.

373
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:55,584
You know what... Do as you want,
I'm not going further.

374
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:58,567
This is the cursed place?

375
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:04,654
Take the rope! Hold it!

376
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:12,402
Peter, hold on tight!

377
01:11:19,057 --> 01:11:22,982
I'll take the swamp,
and you go to the cursed place.

378
01:12:30,808 --> 01:12:35,073
I'll buy you a new saddle.

379
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:56,415
Plenty of chervons, we have.

380
01:12:59,337 --> 01:13:02,079
You see how much there is?

381
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,273
Peter, hold the rope tight!

382
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:15,254
I'm holding, I'm holding...

383
01:13:49,578 --> 01:13:52,378
Petrus, from here I can draw everything!

384
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:55,472
Lift my instruments!

385
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,673
draw, draw...

386
01:14:01,073 --> 01:14:02,773
Quiet.

387
01:14:27,905 --> 01:14:28,905
Have you heard?

388
01:14:29,105 --> 01:14:35,690
Scientist sucked all the blood from
Petrus, on the cursed place! He's completely pale!

389
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:38,890
I saw something exactly like that
in my dreams...

390
01:14:40,016 --> 01:14:44,400
Gather people, father Paisiy calls for the sermon!

391
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,000
Get up, you old devil, the scientist...

392
01:14:50,026 --> 01:14:57,942
<i>Great efforts and exhausted organism made me
succumb to the influence of these stories.</i>

393
01:14:58,124 --> 01:15:04,487
<i>They reminded me of pirates, bandits without
consciences, that ended their lifes hanged,</i>

394
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:13,164
<i>to the satisfaction and delight of the audience.
Fear not, darling, first impression often deceives.</i>

395
01:15:13,465 --> 01:15:15,165
Overko!

396
01:15:17,066 --> 01:15:20,266
- To hell with you...
- Overko!

397
01:15:24,331 --> 01:15:31,264
- What is it friend? - Scientist is on the old church.
- Damn him! - And you're hiding money again?

398
01:15:33,065 --> 01:15:36,965
Inform Paisiy,
I'll go to the cursed place!

399
01:15:57,083 --> 01:16:04,745
We didn't make it. We came to the cursed place, and
scientist was already standing on the roof. And Petrus is there.

400
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:10,026
It does not matter, Overko is there. If something
happens, the scientist will get a bullet in the back.

401
01:16:10,336 --> 01:16:13,379
Tell me, what do we do next?

402
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:17,917
We'll put the blame on pan Sotnik.

403
01:16:18,257 --> 01:16:23,711
Nothing...  People trust me
and they're ready to punish the infidels.

404
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:30,824
Pan Sotnik wants eulogy for
his daughter. So be it...

405
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:56,252
Stay there, I'll need you.

406
01:17:11,547 --> 01:17:15,801
In front of you, does not stand
the shepherd, with the right to judge you.

407
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:22,458
In front of you is a slave, a worm,
that you can spit upon.

408
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:26,372
But I call on you...

409
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:33,085
Do not try to understand the reasons,
or search the reason behind everything...

410
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:39,605
They say we are in darkness and ignorance.
Let them talk.

411
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:45,648
Send away from you those
carrying the light of knowledge ...

412
01:17:47,752 --> 01:17:54,704
Where to, pan Sotnik? Have you
no love for the flock of Christ?

413
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:56,633
Where to?

414
01:17:59,804 --> 01:18:04,317
A flock indeed.
We're doomed.

415
01:18:04,657 --> 01:18:13,735
Pan Sotnik's pride is to be blamed for everything.
And scientists that think they are all knowing!

416
01:18:17,782 --> 01:18:23,988
My gold ...
I must hide it better.

417
01:18:24,339 --> 01:18:27,422
Scientist isn't going anywhere, anyway.

418
01:18:33,628 --> 01:18:38,860
Fear the newcomer!
I can see Satan's army going behind him!

419
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:11,587
Chase the demon far away,
make it burn under his feet!

420
01:19:11,687 --> 01:19:13,087
Hallelujah!

421
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:54,045
- My instruments are up there.
Petrus, pull me up! - Where?

422
01:20:01,425 --> 01:20:07,198
- What was that, Peter? I don't understand.
- I told you this place is damned.

423
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:10,154
We should run!

424
01:20:16,055 --> 01:20:18,955
- My Maps ...
- Run!

425
01:20:39,284 --> 01:20:41,784
Hallelujah!

426
01:20:51,284 --> 01:20:53,947
Go to Sotnik!

427
01:20:58,441 --> 01:21:02,173
- What did you saw there?
- Work of the devil...

428
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:12,628
-You too? - You weren't there!
- Any connection with the scientist is damned!

429
01:21:13,156 --> 01:21:18,847
- Go! - You don't understand...
- Go and finish your job!

430
01:21:19,603 --> 01:21:23,256
If you do not,
you will not be able to sit!

431
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,933
I have to go there myself.

432
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:35,028
Dorosh...

433
01:21:42,896 --> 01:21:49,310
You said Overko will not let him leave alive.
And now, he came back and went to Sotnik.

434
01:21:49,642 --> 01:21:53,073
- Who? - The scientist!
Bring him here!

435
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:00,061
- Who?
- Petrus!

436
01:22:08,731 --> 01:22:13,335
- I asked you to fix it,
and you broke it. -No.

437
01:22:14,186 --> 01:22:20,153
You scientists can't
know what I know.

438
01:22:27,059 --> 01:22:30,761
- Put him here.
- Dorosh, what are you doing?

439
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,447
What are you doing?

440
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:40,353
Close his mouth, Dorosh,
he'll alarm the whole Hutor!

441
01:22:43,706 --> 01:22:46,900
- With this?
- No, find something else.

442
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:53,003
No, Dorosh! Father Paisiy,
stop this joke, that's enough! Enough ...

443
01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:57,889
What was the scientist doing there?

444
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,907
Pan Sotnik sent him!

445
01:23:05,267 --> 01:23:11,724
He promised him a 1000 chervons,
that you left on the cursed place.

446
01:23:12,114 --> 01:23:14,737
Bravo... Bravo.

447
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:21,183
In the future, you will inform me,
about everything you find out.

448
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,793
Go, but let no one see you!

449
01:23:34,006 --> 01:23:36,849
I'm going, but I'll not serve you!

450
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:42,025
This time do not let the scientist out of your
sight, and I will gather the people!

451
01:23:44,016 --> 01:23:45,858
All right.

452
01:23:50,402 --> 01:23:53,174
Where had Overko disappeared?

453
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,519
To the church!

454
01:24:21,393 --> 01:24:25,827
Pan scientist, Paisiy will
send the Cossacks, you should run!

455
01:24:26,097 --> 01:24:31,560
- I'll go with you, under one condition!
- What? - I'll take Nastusya with me.

456
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:49,261
Nastusya, get ready, I came to get you.
Take nothing unnecessary. I have some toast.

457
01:24:54,876 --> 01:24:57,939
Or you don't agree? You hear me?

458
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:01,512
Then I'll steal you, by God!

459
01:25:03,945 --> 01:25:12,064
Look, I've prepared a rope, but I wont tie you,
because you'll come with me. Right, Nastusya?

460
01:25:13,825 --> 01:25:15,818
So, no.

461
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:21,482
I'll go alone.

462
01:25:22,453 --> 01:25:28,069
I'll go and you wont see me again.

463
01:25:28,569 --> 01:25:32,313
Maybe, latter, you'll cry
for me. Goodbye.

464
01:25:35,226 --> 01:25:40,742
Nastusya...
My love, come with me.

465
01:25:42,723 --> 01:25:46,895
- Let's go!
- We'll wait for you. In the boat.

466
01:25:54,145 --> 01:25:58,907
Overko! Overko!

467
01:26:01,908 --> 01:26:04,908
Where are you? Friend!

468
01:26:18,379 --> 01:26:20,951
What the hell is wrong with you?

469
01:26:21,842 --> 01:26:23,773
I'll kill you!

470
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:27,809
Where did you hide my money?

471
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:36,975
- What's wrong with you? You're out of your mind
because of that money! - You stole it!

472
01:26:43,784 --> 01:26:51,058
- You think you can say whatever falls on
your mind,  is it? - Brother Dorosh, shall we smoke?

473
01:26:58,208 --> 01:27:00,722
Where's my pipe?

474
01:27:05,223 --> 01:27:08,523
Overko! Overko!

475
01:27:33,821 --> 01:27:35,498
Nastusya!

476
01:27:36,499 --> 01:27:39,099
Nastusya, we're here!

477
01:27:45,545 --> 01:27:48,899
- Petrus, where to?
- I'm going after her!

478
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:19,630
Overko! How many times did we
save each other? What is this now?

479
01:28:22,892 --> 01:28:24,654
Nastusya!

480
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:31,441
Nastusya...

481
01:28:34,393 --> 01:28:43,163
Forget the hatred! Let's go to pan Sotnik and
recall Cossack feats. And we'll drink!

482
01:29:05,824 --> 01:29:11,411
Nice pipe, you have. No one else
has such. Here, have a smoke!

483
01:29:13,862 --> 01:29:15,575
Friend...

484
01:29:22,061 --> 01:29:29,588
Viy! Viy...
There, in the swamp.

485
01:29:30,339 --> 01:29:33,041
Viy, the horned monster!

486
01:29:33,272 --> 01:29:41,261
Time has come to eradicate devil's seed, with the
word of God, with the flame and the sword!

487
01:29:44,373 --> 01:29:46,965
Why so little?

488
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:59,339
Mute girl... Good that you're mute.

489
01:30:03,281 --> 01:30:07,537
Come here... Come...
Mute girl.

490
01:30:17,696 --> 01:30:20,227
Don't kill me!
She killed Dorosh!

491
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:25,618
She's a witch! Witch!

492
01:30:41,059 --> 01:30:47,065
Father Paisiy, Nastusya didn't do this,
it was the unholy one. I saw him!

493
01:30:48,857 --> 01:30:56,124
Father Paisiy, I saw him!
With seven horns. It wasn't Nastusya!

494
01:30:57,365 --> 01:30:59,558
What do I do...

495
01:32:09,977 --> 01:32:12,510
Hold him...
Hold him...

496
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:35,133
Judas...

497
01:32:50,727 --> 01:32:53,019
You wont escape!

498
01:32:53,810 --> 01:33:00,742
Map. But, map is not what you wanted.
You wanted to find out what happened to your daughter.

499
01:33:01,608 --> 01:33:05,390
- Find out what?
- I know what happened.

500
01:33:12,836 --> 01:33:14,981
You know who it is?

501
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:18,784
Hold him!

502
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,855
Animals know everything...

503
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:26,592
Find him! I'll spare no expense.

504
01:33:26,892 --> 01:33:32,673
My terms are, save Nastusya
and guarantee my safety.

505
01:33:33,081 --> 01:33:36,853
We'll do that now!

506
01:33:46,862 --> 01:33:49,924
What demonic deeds are done here?

507
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:54,102
Release Nastusya now!

508
01:33:54,302 --> 01:33:59,908
That girl had split Dorosh at half,
in front of my very eyes!

509
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:04,595
- What are you saying, bastard?
- Witch ... - Open up!

510
01:34:05,013 --> 01:34:07,924
- No.
- What, what?

511
01:34:08,308 --> 01:34:11,137
No. It's not permitted.

512
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:19,085
-Who does not permit?
Who does not permit? -Me.

513
01:34:20,445 --> 01:34:23,924
I would watch what I'm saying,
if I was you.

514
01:34:24,241 --> 01:34:27,052
Do not keep people here.

515
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,892
Filth! Demon's seed!

516
01:34:42,675 --> 01:34:44,937
Catch him!

517
01:34:57,983 --> 01:35:00,126
Hold him...

518
01:35:09,702 --> 01:35:11,388
No!

519
01:35:12,514 --> 01:35:15,419
Throw him in the pit with the witch.

520
01:35:19,587 --> 01:35:22,357
We will interrogate him later.

521
01:35:24,133 --> 01:35:26,894
No escape from here!

522
01:35:29,088 --> 01:35:31,716
Knowledge is the light.

523
01:35:59,276 --> 01:36:03,688
- Let's see what that punk is writing.
<i>My darling, miss Dudley...</i>

524
01:36:04,465 --> 01:36:06,108
Like this...

525
01:36:06,551 --> 01:36:16,260
<i>The wings of local residents resemble
the wings of some species of bats.</i>

526
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,197
<i>Their wingspan is greater than three meters.</i>

527
01:36:20,397 --> 01:36:21,916
What!?

528
01:36:22,216 --> 01:36:28,073
<i>I felt their breath so close, that if
I've reached out, I would've touched their skin.</i>

529
01:36:29,323 --> 01:36:32,785
<i>They, also have, hooves.</i>

530
01:36:33,102 --> 01:36:35,721
Did you hear this?

531
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:42,386
<i>Do you remember the one-legged sailor
that we met in London's docks?</i>

532
01:36:42,686 --> 01:36:46,033
<i>He showed us a huge octopus.</i>

533
01:36:53,773 --> 01:36:56,041
Why are you crying?

534
01:36:57,126 --> 01:37:02,987
- I haven't got a letter from him in a while.
- Don't think about him. He's not worth the tears.

535
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:05,842
Dad, please!

536
01:37:07,736 --> 01:37:15,327
<i>Here, they have a ten times bigger one.
It has six eyes and is called Viy.</i>

537
01:37:15,527 --> 01:37:17,654
He's insane!

538
01:37:18,054 --> 01:37:23,961
<i>If I don't return,
search for me in the cursed place!</i>

539
01:37:25,587 --> 01:37:30,017
Lord, make it be so.

540
01:38:33,654 --> 01:38:36,741
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you.

541
01:38:38,284 --> 01:38:40,885
It will be all right.

542
01:38:46,792 --> 01:38:52,950
The swamp...The monster...
Are you feeding him long?

543
01:38:55,843 --> 01:38:58,906
A month? A year?

544
01:39:04,327 --> 01:39:06,678
This is a map.

545
01:39:06,896 --> 01:39:11,273
My life's work.
Now, it may be gone forever.

546
01:39:11,867 --> 01:39:17,615
Wait ... these are not my markings!

547
01:39:19,033 --> 01:39:21,801
This is an escape route.

548
01:39:22,372 --> 01:39:26,457
Sotnik is a dangerous man.
What the hell are we waiting for?

549
01:39:31,504 --> 01:39:34,198
I want power!
And money.

550
01:39:34,398 --> 01:39:37,084
Money is for the temple.

551
01:39:38,594 --> 01:39:42,322
We have to decide,
she saw everything.

552
01:39:44,642 --> 01:39:48,045
I want the ritual, to be performed,
in the swamp.

553
01:39:48,563 --> 01:39:52,783
All people must be
involved in her death.

554
01:39:54,193 --> 01:39:56,796
You devised that nicely.

555
01:40:00,449 --> 01:40:05,054
I would like to know,
who is hiding under that skin?

556
01:40:06,872 --> 01:40:08,774
Go now!

557
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:22,104
What is it, witch?

558
01:40:24,658 --> 01:40:28,069
Taras ... conspiracy!

559
01:41:07,224 --> 01:41:09,719
Run, Nastusya!

560
01:41:14,138 --> 01:41:18,677
Where to stupid woman?
You want to watch someone suffering?

561
01:41:19,277 --> 01:41:22,645
- Let's go!
- Where to? Sit down!

562
01:41:23,622 --> 01:41:25,893
Old devil!

563
01:41:27,018 --> 01:41:28,703
Witch!

564
01:42:05,364 --> 01:42:11,416
From here, you will not escape. It's nicely said,
all trouble comes from knowledge.

565
01:42:15,124 --> 01:42:19,500
- What are you doing here?
- A miracle happened! - What miracle?

566
01:42:19,912 --> 01:42:22,738
From Paisiy's holy water!

567
01:42:23,139 --> 01:42:27,739
My daughter got angry and
began to swell, swell ...

568
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,740
And turned into a frog!

569
01:42:31,031 --> 01:42:37,442
-Paisiy's holy water turned her back human, again.
- You're lying, aren't you? You're lying, Yavtukh?

570
01:42:38,122 --> 01:42:40,040
Dog lies!

571
01:42:44,362 --> 01:42:46,714
You want the truth?

572
01:42:47,365 --> 01:42:52,575
- Don't ever get angry!
- You speak like a woman, Yavtukh!

573
01:42:55,789 --> 01:43:03,631
You hear? When they put the witch
in the water, she'll fly !

574
01:43:04,457 --> 01:43:10,742
- Can you take my watch? - No... - Come on, Yavtukh!
You're not doing anything, anyway.

575
01:43:11,043 --> 01:43:14,043
I'd really like to see that...

576
01:43:15,893 --> 01:43:20,030
Fine, I'll  keep an eye on.
But don't stay long!

577
01:43:34,762 --> 01:43:37,497
Hello, pan scientist!

578
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:44,430
Petrus!

579
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:51,500
Go through the swamp.
I stole these two horses.

580
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:58,518
Go forward, don't do anything,
and you'll live.

581
01:43:59,644 --> 01:44:03,649
Paisiy. Paisiy and Overko.
Conspiracy!

582
01:44:04,775 --> 01:44:08,976
- Beware of them!
- I understand! Go! - Thank you!

583
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:14,501
This woman may be a witch!

584
01:44:15,002 --> 01:44:17,702
What are you doing with those stones?

585
01:44:18,997 --> 01:44:24,267
- Paisiy said, everyone should take a stone.
- ...and will be tested in water.

586
01:44:24,519 --> 01:44:28,057
If she surfaces, she's a witch!

587
01:44:51,613 --> 01:44:59,696
Brothers and sisters, punishment will come to
anyone who doesn't listen to me.

588
01:44:59,996 --> 01:45:03,005
- Done.
- Finish it up.

589
01:45:03,299 --> 01:45:06,735
- Peter! Peter!
- Go away!

590
01:45:17,138 --> 01:45:20,365
- You should have let me disappear!
- 'Disappear'...

591
01:45:20,565 --> 01:45:23,665
What are you saying?
Khoma 'disappeared'. What does that mean?

592
01:45:23,753 --> 01:45:30,622
- It means he's gone! -No, no, I don't understand!
Where did you bury him?

593
01:45:30,952 --> 01:45:38,637
-There was nothing to bury!
- Listen, Peter, we can save Nastusya.

594
01:45:39,075 --> 01:45:44,912
- I know what you saw. - What?
- Sheep skin with horns.

595
01:45:45,209 --> 01:45:51,681
It's in the swamp. Wear it and divert their
attention. They will run after you. Understand?

596
01:45:51,981 --> 01:45:56,016
- I get it! I get it!
- Get up and go!

597
01:45:58,554 --> 01:46:01,591
Lead them to the cursed place!

598
01:46:10,774 --> 01:46:17,739
I didn't know... I didn't know
I'll live to see such shame.

599
01:46:22,411 --> 01:46:25,147
Shame to the people.

600
01:46:25,347 --> 01:46:34,673
Now everyone come here, let her be judged,
let her be send to God's judgment.

601
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:41,563
Viy!

602
01:46:45,726 --> 01:46:49,896
Look, he fell! He fell!

603
01:46:51,773 --> 01:46:56,478
Stop! Stop...

604
01:46:59,448 --> 01:47:01,442
Catch him!

605
01:49:10,244 --> 01:49:13,289
Looking for this?

606
01:49:22,081 --> 01:49:24,492
Khoma Brutus...

607
01:49:27,678 --> 01:49:30,640
You wanted to kill me, didn't you?

608
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:39,024
To take my maps and get away unpunished?
Facts are important. These are facts!

609
01:49:41,566 --> 01:49:50,068
You liked the young mistress.
In argument you wounded her, and left her to die.

610
01:49:54,829 --> 01:50:02,679
And she believed that, after three
days of reading prayers over her, you will repent.

611
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:13,440
But you showed your cruelty. 'He knows who...'
These were her last words before death.

612
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:19,288
With one sheep skin, you kept whole Hutor in fright,
for a year.

613
01:50:27,629 --> 01:50:30,741
I'll show you to the people.
Get up!

614
01:50:31,241 --> 01:50:38,034
What do you want of me?
I'm tired from it all. I had enough.

615
01:50:48,007 --> 01:50:55,517
- You won't believe me anyway. - Where did you get that belt? - When I pulled you, the case unhooked.

616
01:50:56,391 --> 01:51:00,311
- You're lying. - I told
you wouldn't believe me.

617
01:51:01,095 --> 01:51:05,506
- Why did you need my maps?
- It was the only way to salvation.

618
01:51:18,905 --> 01:51:21,624
Where could I go?

619
01:51:22,625 --> 01:51:28,982
To the seminary? You don't leave that world so easily.
Or, like you, they would think that I killed the girl.

620
01:51:29,382 --> 01:51:33,275
- Unclean spirit!
- Lads, it's me, Khoma!

621
01:51:35,764 --> 01:51:38,774
You tricked Overko and Dorosh into quarrel?

622
01:51:40,076 --> 01:51:47,978
- Their greed destroyed them.
- Why did the mistress chose you?

623
01:51:51,404 --> 01:51:57,950
Year ago, Gorobets, Khalyava and me,
we strayed to this place and spent the night here.

624
01:52:03,482 --> 01:52:06,219
What is your name, boy?

625
01:52:08,171 --> 01:52:11,007
Khoma. Philosopher.

626
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:17,347
Come here, philosopher.

627
01:52:20,516 --> 01:52:25,439
Khoma... Don't be afraid,
I won't bite.

628
01:52:30,108 --> 01:52:33,053
We just met, but I
won't refuse you...

629
01:52:34,405 --> 01:52:38,126
It was destiny that brought us together.

630
01:52:43,827 --> 01:52:45,627
Mistress!

631
01:52:56,028 --> 01:52:57,828
Mistress!

632
01:53:03,842 --> 01:53:08,772
Nastusya could have thought that I
did it, so I've put on the sheep skin.

633
01:53:09,407 --> 01:53:13,201
She saw me,
but only as a monster.

634
01:53:13,502 --> 01:53:18,202
Out of gratefulness for saving her,
she was bringing me food.

635
01:53:20,075 --> 01:53:24,371
Entire year, I'm praying here,
for salvation of the soul of young mistress.

636
01:53:24,571 --> 01:53:29,339
First three nights were terrible.
I survived all sorts of horrors.

637
01:53:30,077 --> 01:53:36,221
On the third night, I was completely exhausted.
And when the roosters sang, he came!

638
01:53:36,922 --> 01:53:44,222
- I already know who is Viy.
- He's even more terrible. - Who? Who is he?

639
01:53:44,599 --> 01:53:46,509
That's him!

640
01:54:04,019 --> 01:54:08,048
Are you tired, little devil?

641
01:54:11,251 --> 01:54:19,134
Have you recognized me, Khoma? How is
 life without her? She seduced me too!

642
01:54:24,264 --> 01:54:31,879
I thought you're dead, but you're alive. 
I wanted to scare them with sheep skin and horns.

643
01:54:32,179 --> 01:54:38,928
But she tempted me ... Oh, just how were 
glistening, her black devilish eyes!

644
01:54:39,328 --> 01:54:46,033
There's no sin on me. It is said, sinner is not
the one who is tempted, but the one who tempts!  


645
01:54:46,333 --> 01:54:53,114
Also, he doesn't know what kind of pleasure
 is hidden in fornication. She made me hate her.

646
01:54:53,759 --> 01:54:55,587
Somebody help me...

647
01:55:17,308 --> 01:55:20,069
No one can help you.

648
01:55:20,569 --> 01:55:28,720
Dead mouth can't talk, 
it is said! No one will ever know!

649
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:33,646
- Where did you hide my gold? 
- Let him go!

650
01:55:33,882 --> 01:55:38,304
Or you'll lose your larkspur
 and your head.

651
01:55:40,013 --> 01:55:42,607
Run, save yourself!

652
01:55:46,753 --> 01:55:50,416
People want miracles and 
I give them miracles!

653
01:55:50,991 --> 01:55:54,745
I spent many years as a
missionary in Europe.

654
01:55:55,445 --> 01:56:03,609
I know how to create a new religion. 
Without miracles! With the help of your inventions!

655
01:56:04,338 --> 01:56:08,669
I am the new prophet!

656
01:56:11,828 --> 01:56:14,464
And you will die.

657
01:56:16,307 --> 01:56:20,812
As a priest, I can't 
let you die without repentance.

658
01:56:21,588 --> 01:56:24,008
Read the prayer.

659
01:56:38,922 --> 01:56:41,068
Nastusya!

660
01:56:47,739 --> 01:56:49,785
Nastusya!

661
01:56:59,209 --> 01:57:01,162
Nastusya!

662
01:57:03,004 --> 01:57:08,727
I want you to know that your 
life is not in the hands of the Lord ...

663
01:57:09,928 --> 01:57:12,104
But in my hands.

664
01:57:12,363 --> 01:57:16,827
I decide who will 
live and who will die.

665
01:57:17,894 --> 01:57:20,238
Be damned!

666
01:57:35,586 --> 01:57:38,273
Go do something else.

667
01:57:39,473 --> 01:57:45,647
Little Daniel... Forgive me.

668
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:53,180
I'm ashamed to admit it, 
but I was wrong about your father.

669
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:05,008
Trust me, he is great and brave man. 
These are his letters to your mother.

670
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:11,155
I intend to publish them.

671
01:58:11,455 --> 01:58:18,773
I want the world to know, that it's wrong to 
judge someone so rash as I did.

672
01:58:22,166 --> 01:58:27,710
Unfortunate Bruno was burned at the stake, 
and then they realized that the Earth is round.

673
01:58:32,677 --> 01:58:38,859
Letters are now in your hands. 
Keep them with you.

674
01:58:44,313 --> 01:58:46,031
Jonathan!

675
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:52,538
Another pigeon. We will 
find out together how the story ended.

676
01:58:53,864 --> 01:58:59,174
- Yavtukh, where are you going? - There! 
- You're not afraid? - Cossack fears nothing.

677
01:58:59,894 --> 01:59:06,752
I want you to know that your 
life is not in the hands of the Lord, but in my hands.

678
01:59:08,345 --> 01:59:13,183
I decide who will 
live and who will die.

679
01:59:13,383 --> 01:59:18,114
Paisiy is shouting, I can hear him clearly.

680
01:59:23,627 --> 01:59:25,981
Be damned!

681
02:00:02,356 --> 02:00:04,636
Mama!

682
02:00:18,865 --> 02:00:21,369
<i>A miracle happened./i></i>

683
02:00:26,623 --> 02:00:33,192
<i>I felt the breath of God and His touch,  
that changed my fate.</i>

684
02:00:33,492 --> 02:00:37,959
<i>Never before or after, have 
I felt anything like it.</i>

685
02:00:38,359 --> 02:00:42,613
<i>My whole previous life 
flew in front of me.</i>

686
02:00:42,897 --> 02:00:47,201
<i>I thought, after I die,
who will succeed me?</i>

687
02:00:47,493 --> 02:00:51,023
<i>Darling, I want us to have a child.</i>

688
02:00:52,023 --> 02:00:57,495
I want to tell you, how good friends
your master and I were.

689
02:00:57,695 --> 02:00:59,413
Easy!

690
02:01:03,242 --> 02:01:08,454
<i>Evil was punished and I received a fee. <i>
- Those are Sotnik's chervons!</i></i>

691
02:01:11,955 --> 02:01:14,655
It's my money! My!

692
02:01:21,327 --> 02:01:22,907
Peter!

693
02:01:27,358 --> 02:01:33,439
<i>The body and the soul of the mistress found peace, 
and her father, serenity.</i>

694
02:01:38,568 --> 02:01:45,208
<i>Khoma, with a touch of distrust toward  
science, reminded little of the former seminarian.</i>

695
02:01:47,453 --> 02:01:57,100
<i>And fate had brought me to this remote place,
to finish the story that he started.</i>

696
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Out of the way!

697
02:02:09,424 --> 02:02:15,769
This is a magic lantern! 
Miracle created with human genius!

698
02:02:22,362 --> 02:02:27,476
It can build, but, it can also destroy, 
depending on the hands that posses it.

699
02:02:27,776 --> 02:02:35,801
Pictures will come alive, and we will see 
beautiful cities and lovely people.

700
02:02:41,631 --> 02:02:47,366
- Did you find Paisiy? 
-No. He's no where to be found.

701
02:02:48,138 --> 02:02:50,081
He 'disappeared'.

702
02:02:50,373 --> 02:02:57,887
Two peculiar rats
extremely and unnaturally large...

703
02:02:58,488 --> 02:03:04,488
They sniffed, sniffed...
And went away.

704
02:03:04,789 --> 02:03:07,489
Say, was it so?

705
02:03:10,118 --> 02:03:16,337
- All women are witches. 
- The older, the bigger.

706
02:03:50,325 --> 02:03:52,101
Damn...

707
02:03:53,661 --> 02:03:56,279
What's the problem?

708
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:03,792
- Pan scientist, one toast before the trip?
- I drank. - For the road? - I drank.

709
02:04:04,055 --> 02:04:07,882
- What about the memory?
- For that, I didn't.

710
02:04:10,002 --> 02:04:12,221
True cossack!

711
02:04:13,047 --> 02:04:14,783
Spirid!

712
02:04:20,083 --> 02:04:21,701
Raise!

713
02:04:48,925 --> 02:04:53,679
I don't know where
 this cogwheel should go...

714
02:04:54,321 --> 02:05:00,759
<i>Now, when the passions subsided and cold 
logic again mastered my reasoning,</i>

715
02:05:01,059 --> 02:05:05,854
<i>I can say that all 
fantastic events of the last few days,</i>

716
02:05:06,154 --> 02:05:10,287
<i>were only images created 
by human brain,</i>

717
02:05:10,587 --> 02:05:15,067
<i>that still remains poorly studied 
by modern science.</i>

718
02:05:28,267 --> 02:05:29,967
London

719
02:05:31,067 --> 02:05:32,967
Hutor

720
02:05:39,067 --> 02:05:42,367
Moscow
