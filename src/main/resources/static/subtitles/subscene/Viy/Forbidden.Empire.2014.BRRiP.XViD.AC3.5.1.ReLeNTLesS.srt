(Gasping)

6
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:15,862
You hold your ground, Sir.

7
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:17,529
Have you no shame, Madam?

8
00:01:17,562 --> 00:01:19,395
Debauching yourself
in your father's house?

9
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:20,929
And with a common teacher?

10
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:22,329
I am of the king's court.

11
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:23,329
Ha!

12
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:24,962
And I'm not just a teacher.

13
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:27,562
I'm a Bachelor of Geography
and Cartography.

14
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:28,962
Don't bandy words
with me, Sir.

15
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:30,295
You're a charlatan!

16
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,962
Like that rogue Newton,

17
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,462
Who swindled half of Europe

18
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:35,462
When an apple
fell on his head.

19
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,362
GIRL:
Father, I love him.

20
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:38,929
Love him? Him?

21
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:40,695
He can't even afford
a decent pair of britches.

22
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:43,595
I've great plans that'll
bring me fame and fortune.

23
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:45,395
Yes I'm sure,
by marrying my daughter.

24
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:46,595
No. What I mean is--

25
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:47,862
What do you mean,
"no"?

26
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:49,362
Of course I intend
to marry you,

27
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:50,862
Just not now. More--

28
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:52,062
In the future.

29
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,729
Ha ha!

30
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:55,629
If I have my way,
he doesn't have a future.

31
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:56,829
Get him out of here.

32
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:58,495
Well go on!

33
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:01,829
Jonathan, run!

34
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:03,362
(Lively classical music playing)

35
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:06,529
Shoot him in the back!

36
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:07,829
Run Jonathan, run!

37
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,595
If your mother was alive,

38
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,995
She'd be appalled.

39
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:12,995
(Men shouting)

40
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,395
Set the dogs on him!

41
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:17,762
Run, darling!

42
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,062
I love you!

43
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:20,495
I love you too, darling!

44
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,262
Believe in me!

45
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:31,362
*

46
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:32,562
Why thank you.

47
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:34,929
Don't forget your birds.

48
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,362

50
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:47,929
JONATHAN:
 My dear Miss Dadli,

51
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,762
I offer you
 my deepest apologies

52
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,329
For my hurried departure.

53
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:52,929
As bitter as it is
 to admit to you,

54
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:56,395
I have to say that
 your father was right.

55
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:58,929
It is true that I have spent
 all of my money,

56
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:00,695
But let me tell you,
 I have not wasted it

57
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:02,295
As he wants to imagine,

58
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:04,529
But invested it
 in my invention.

59
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,795
With the help
 of this unique device,

60
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:12,029
I'm determined to revolutionize
 the field of cartography

61
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:14,595
With maps that finally show
 the true borders

62
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,829
Of the countries of the world.

63
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:20,562
I have decided to commence
 this grand project

64
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:22,295
Right from the heart
 of our beloved Greenwich,

65
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,795
Which I have chosen to be

66
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,929
The starting point
 for all my calculations.

67
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:30,362
Some day,
 our quiet little town

68
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:33,062
Will be renowned the world over
 as the place

69
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,795
All time is measured against.

70
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,529
This is the dream,

71
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:38,462
But I need you
 to believe in me.

72
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:45,029
My dear, the impressions of my
 journey I write in my letters.

73
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:48,329
In order for them not to be
 read by unintended persons,

74
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,029
I encrypt the letters
 using a mirror,

75
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,362
As Leonardo Da Vinci
 did before me.

76
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:54,362
I love you,

77
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:57,695
And refuse to be thought of
 as some dowry hunter.

78
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:59,729
I will show everyone
 that that is not true.

79
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:04,429
My news will fly to you
 by means of carrier pigeon.

80
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:10,695
In this way, when times of
 great difficulty confront me,

81
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,995
I will feel you close to me

82
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:14,295
And my heart will be warmed.

83
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:28,729
MAN, NARRATING:
 Lower your eyes.

84
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:31,029
Kneel down and pray.

85
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,395
Be afraid of the eyes of Viy,

86
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:35,895
The ancient god who dwells

87
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:39,895
In the eternal darkness
 of the cave.

88
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:44,395
His eyes have taken root
 in the Earth.

89
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:47,462
If a man but glances at him,

90
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,695
Then that man dies.

91
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:55,062
And no prayer can conquer
 that mysterious fear.

92
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,295
The old folks say so,
 and their grandparents said so.

93
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,429
On summer nights,

94
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,462
Young girls looking
 for true love

95
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:09,429
Float burning candles
 on wreaths in the water.

96
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:15,495
And if some young man
 gathers in your wreath,

97
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,629
You know that he
 is your destiny.

98
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,729
Since the beginning of time

99
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:24,929
When the Earth was young
 and the gods were young,

100
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:28,262
This tradition has lived in the
 hearts of the Slavic people.

101
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,862
Burning candles float
 in the darkness.

102
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:36,662
It has always been so.

103
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,629
(Thunder rumbling)

104
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:42,062
(Birds shrieking)

105
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:44,062
Pannochka?

106
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,462
Where are you?

107
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,829
(Thunder rumbling)

108
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:50,629
(Thunder crashing)

109
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,029
Pannochka!

110
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:58,329
(Marsh birds chirping)

111
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:00,695
Time to go, Pannochka!

112
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:01,995
(Thunder crashing)

113
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,595
(Gasping)

114
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,729
(Shrieking)

115
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,029
(Screaming)

116
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,529
(Thunder crashing)

117
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:37,295
*

118
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,895
(Growling)

119
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:55,762
Pannochka!
Pannochka!

120
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:56,929
MAN:
Pannochka!

121
00:06:58,762 --> 00:06:59,729
MAN:
Right here!

122
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:00,895
Got her.

123
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:03,362
Who did this?

124
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:09,762
Who did this to you?

125
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,429
She wants to confess.

126
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:12,562
You must pray over me.

127
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,695
God help us.

128
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,595
Protect us from evil.

129
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:16,995
There's a student priest
from the seminary.

130
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,862
Khoma Brutus.

131
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:22,029
He'll pray by me for three
nights, truly and sincerely.

132
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:25,695
He knows who wears the sheep's.

133
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:30,329
MAN:
I think she's dead.

134
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:31,529
(People murmuring)

135
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:32,695
Look!

136
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:34,629
The wages of sin!

137
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,762
One dead and one
out of her mind!

138
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,862
(Bell tolling)

139
00:07:48,762 --> 00:07:50,495
(Ominous chanting)

140
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:59,629
So complete your three nights
of prayer over my daughter,

141
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:00,929
Exactly as she requested,

142
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:02,395
And I will reward you.

143
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:03,529
Who, me?

144
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:05,395
Yes, you.

145
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:08,695
It was my daughter's dying wish
and you must fulfill it.

146
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,962
Have you ever felt the whip
crack on your skin?

147
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:14,695
No, and it is not something
I want to happen to me.

148
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,462
Then do not fail me.

149
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,729
I'll pay you
a thousand gold coins

150
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:20,429
If you succeed in this.

151
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,895
(Whispering)
A thousand gold coins.

152
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,695
You will not be allowed
to fail me.

153
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:27,829
Master Sotnik--
Lock the door.

154
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:29,895
He stays here
for three nights.

155
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,862
(Door closing heavily)

156
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:36,662
Please, dear God,
hear your humble servant

157
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:40,562
And forgive his sins
through Our Lord Jesus Christ.

158
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:44,329
Amen.

159
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:48,562
* Oh Lord,
our Father dear God *

160
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,662
* Embrace us all
in your faith *

161
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:54,862
* And the whole--

162
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:01,962
(Ominous music playing)

163
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:10,695
*

164
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:11,762
Chalk circle,

165
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,962
Save me, protect me.

166
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:15,695
Chalk circle,
save me, protect me!

167
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,495
Save me, protect me.

168
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,595
(Shrieking)

169
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,795
Here is a thousand gold coins.

170
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:37,062
Blessings for you.

171
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:40,629
We could-- we could build
a monastery with this.

172
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,595
No. That's Khoma's fee.

173
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,795
Now leave and prepare everything
for my daughter's funeral.

174
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,329
Let's get it done, soon.

175
00:09:58,362 --> 00:09:59,595
What?

176
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:01,395
You know.
Pannochka's burial.

177
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:03,895
For three nights I've had
the shit scared out of me.

178
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:05,729
Master's daughter, yes,
but still a witch.

179
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,462
(Twigs cracking)

180
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:12,362
Oh, it's Paisiy.

181
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:17,562
What do you got there?

182
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:18,762
It's from Sotnik.

183
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,629
It's the fee
he gave to Khoma.

184
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,629
I have never seen
so much money before

185
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,295
In my whole life!

186
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,529
The key.

187
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:41,429
Go on!
Shh!

188
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:43,995
(Wood creaking)

189
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:00,562
(Squawking)

190
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:02,595
PRIEST:
There is a curse here!

191
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,429
Be gone, Satan!

192
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:07,362
This is a cursed place.

193
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:08,862
His soul has departed.

194
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:11,862
This holy place
has been violated.

195
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,995
This can no longer be called
a place of worship.

196
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,562
Board up the doors
and the windows!

197
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:17,862
So she got him
in the end.
Yeah, the witch.

198
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:19,062
There's witchcraft here.

199
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,329
PAISIY:
I declare this!

200
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:22,829
If that's so,

201
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:25,762
Yesterday's rules
are dead and gone.

202
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:31,862
Divide it equally,
like two blood brothers.

203
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,829
(Door closing)

204
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:42,062
There's a hole in the roof.

205
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:44,629
(Hammering)

206
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:49,462
(Grunting)

207
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:52,362
(Squawking)

208
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:53,562
Ahhh!

209
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:55,962
This holy place
has now been cursed!

210
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,795
From top to bottom!

211
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:00,595
See what the witch
has done to me?

212
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:02,395
Khoma is lying lifeless
in the chalk circle.

213
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:06,062
We can never go back in there
again, Master Sotnik.

214
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:08,695
The curse up there
must be a devil of sorts!

215
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,062
This is a cursed place.

216
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,029
We must barricade--

217
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:15,429
We can't leave
my daughter.

218
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:18,762
(Birds shrieking)

219
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:20,995
Look...

220
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:24,795
(People shouting in fear)

221
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:25,929
Don't take the sin
upon your soul.

222
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,495
Don't go in.

223
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,295
Think Sotnik,
your people, they need you!

224
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,895
They need you!

225
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:33,962
Please don't make this
any worse than it is.

226
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,795
In the name of the Father.

227
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,895
(People screaming in background)

228
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:52,562
(Wind whooshing)

229
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:59,662
JONATHAN:
 My travels have continued
 for a whole year.

230
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:04,562
Today is the first day
 of April.

231
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,562
(Horses whinnying)

232
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:08,695
The spring takes so long
 to come here.

233
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:10,729
What awaits me further East?

234
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:12,895
Thank you, Nanny.

235
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,895
Really, my Lord!

236
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,029
Witch.

237
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:24,695
Carrier pigeons now, is it?

238
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:25,995
Papa, please look at me.

239
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:32,462
Oh, God.

240
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:37,562
I'll kill him.

241
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,895
JONATHAN:
 Luck accompanied me
 but now it has turned away.

242
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:49,829
I have not eaten
 for several days.

243
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,295
(Singing softly)

244
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:54,895
And I have none
 of the resources left

245
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:57,662
Necessary for continuing
 this journey.

246
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:03,762
And alas, I have lost
 my path somewhat,

247
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:06,362
Which is now patently clear.

248
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:15,529
*

249
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:16,695
(Horse snorting)

250
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:26,695
(Pigeons cooing)

251
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:36,329
Agh!

252
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:37,629
Please, don't shoot us!

253
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:39,295
JONATHAN:
Who are you?

254
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:40,495
We're common students
at the city seminary!

255
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,329
Students?
S-s-seminary, uh-huh.

256
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:45,329
What about some food,
to eat?

257
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:46,395
Ah--
To eat!

258
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,395
Yes, to eat. Uh-huh?

259
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,629
Yes. It's to eat.

260
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:51,662
Here's to new friends.

261
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:55,462
(Monks chanting in background)

262
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,962
BLOND MONK:
So, you're a scientist.

263
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,795
Ah! We're scientists.

264
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:02,395
I'm Gorobets.
I study rhetoric.

265
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:04,029
And he's a theologian,
Khalyava.

266
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:05,862
Right. Is the city far?

267
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:06,962
No, but there is
a village close by.

268
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:08,495
Hm?
Oh yes.

269
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,029
Oh!

270
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:11,029
It's close!

271
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:12,495
Oh yes.

272
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:13,529
I wouldn't send
an enemy there.

273
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:14,862
Why?

274
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:16,729
Around a year ago,
a friend of ours

275
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:19,462
Was there with us
and suddenly vanished.

276
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:20,695
A scientist?

277
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:21,995
Yes, a scientist.
Philosopher.

278
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,395
Khoma Brutus.

279
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,795
So, about a year ago,

280
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,729
Me, Khoma and Khalyava

281
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:30,562
Passed through here
on the way home

282
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,862
For summer vacation.

283
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:33,762
Either it was the fog,

284
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:34,962
Or maybe the devil
spun us round,

285
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:37,695
But we completely
lost our way.

286
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:48,429
Oh! Look at him!

287
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:50,729
OLD WOMAN:
Stop that!

288
00:15:50,762 --> 00:15:53,362
Have some mercy Gramp--
er, Granny.

289
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:54,629
I thought the Lord was
supposed to provide for you.

290
00:15:57,395 --> 00:16:01,462
* Charity, charity

291
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:04,995
* May the Lord
look on you *
Stop that racket.

292
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,529
Enough now!

293
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:08,529
(Singing trails off)

294
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:11,029
All right then.
Come inside.

295
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:13,562
(Snickering)

296
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,862
This way.

297
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:40,595
Do you, uh,
remember how this goes?

298
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:42,429
Sir, oh please
buy some food?

299
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:45,029
(Laughing)

300
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:46,895
(Laughing)

301
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:55,629
That witch wanted me.

302
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:58,329
She tried to grope me
with her filthy hands.

303
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:00,395
All women are witches.

304
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,462
And the market women?
Witches.

305
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:13,662
(Groaning)

306
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,995
(Breathing heavily)

307
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:57,729
*

308
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:05,462
(Gasping)

309
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,062
Listen, Granny,

310
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:12,729
It's a fasting week.

311
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:14,029
I couldn't sin against that.

312
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:16,295
Not even for a thousand
gold coins.

313
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,529
Don't, don't, don't!

314
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,895
You're too old.
You're too old!

315
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:29,462
*

316
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:30,862
(Cackling)

317
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,329
Aahh!

318
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:43,495
Ahh!

319
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:57,595
*

320
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:01,029
(Birds squawking)

321
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:02,795
(Cackling)

322
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:05,395
Aaaah!

323
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:06,995
Ooooh!

324
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:11,862
GOROBETS:
 The crazy old woman was
 actually Pannochka.

325
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:13,729
She was a witch.

326
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:15,729
He knew that,
 and I knew that for sure.

327
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,929
(Splatting)

328
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:31,462
(Laughing)

329
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:32,762
"Ha ha ha ha."

330
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,562
You think it's funny?
All right then.

331
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:36,062
You listen to me.

332
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:37,762
He just vanished
into thin air.

333
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:40,029
Let me taste
a bit of that.

334
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:41,395
Ah, certainly!

335
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:46,462
Ah?

336
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,362
It's our best,
from Khortytsa.

337
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,462
What do you think?

338
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:50,995
It's not bad.

339
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:55,495
Unlike the village where
Hell's evil is all around.

340
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,595
That's definitely not good.

341
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,662
Evil that not even
our Lord God can stop.

342
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:03,862
PAISIY:
In the name of the Father,

343
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:07,029
The Son and the Holy Spirit.

344
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,562
With this symbol
of our Lord's majesty,

345
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:15,495
We complete the circle.

346
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,529
Ah, so we are prisoners
in our own village prison, eh?

347
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:19,629
Puh!

348
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:22,829
Merciful Lord!

349
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:24,962
Please help me
to protect my children

350
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:26,795
From these devil spirits!

351
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,862
And let them know nothing
of what is locked away

352
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,395
In the old church!

353
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:36,795
Show me a sign!

354
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:38,395
Be my shepherd!

355
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:41,462
(Wind whooshing)

356
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,695
Show them the misery
that is awaiting

357
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:47,362
If they do not choose
to listen to me!

358
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:49,462
(Wind whooshing)

359
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,662
(Frightened whimpering)

360
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,362
(Frightened chatter)

361
00:21:13,562 --> 00:21:15,895
(Squawking)

362
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,962
(Snarling)

363
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,495
(Woman screaming)

364
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:32,962
Did you hear that?

365
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:34,429
So are you convinced now?

366
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:35,562
You said that the uh--

367
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,295
That the monster
had nine horns,

368
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,729
Nine great horns.

369
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:40,529
Seven horns!
Seven.

370
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:42,495
Let's go, let's go.

371
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:43,895
KHALYAVA:
Run!

372
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,462
If you're going on,
it's without us.

373
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:54,395
That's a funny story.

374
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,795
Hey!

375
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:58,662
Colleagues!

376
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:02,895
(Horse whinnying)

377
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:05,595
Shh, shh.

378
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,995
(Horses whinnying anxiously)

379
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:32,362
*

380
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:33,462
Wait! Wait!

381
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:36,562
Where are you going?

382
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:38,762
Stop!

383
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:43,795
Stop, I say!

384
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,462
(Growling)

385
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:51,029
(Gears clicking)

386
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:52,695
(Horses whinnying)

387
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:53,862
Hyah!

388
00:22:58,362 --> 00:22:59,495
(Cranking)

389
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:04,995
(Snarling)

390
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:20,329
*

391
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:22,329
(Snarling)

392
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:39,995
(Gunshot)

393
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:41,962
(Growling)

394
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:54,829
(Crowd chanting in distance)

395
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:57,995
(Men singing indistinctly)

396
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:01,729
(Wolf howling in distance)

397
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,395
(Growling nearby)

398
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:14,462
*

399
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,829
(Horses whinnying)

400
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:19,462
No!

401
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:23,329
Ah! Ah! Ah!

402
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,662
The apocalypse.

403
00:24:28,395 --> 00:24:30,295
(Horses whinnying)

404
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:43,729
*

405
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,662
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

406
00:24:56,629 --> 00:25:10,362
*

407
00:25:10,395 --> 00:25:12,729
--protected by armour
made from fire.

408
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,362
The horses' heads were like
those of lions,

409
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:16,495
And fire and smoke--

410
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:19,362
He's coming!

411
00:25:19,395 --> 00:25:21,529
(People shouting)

412
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:28,595
*

413
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,929
(Horses whinnying)

414
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:49,295
And here is the sign!

415
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:53,362
A messenger sent from Satan
has pierced our circle!

416
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:55,662
(Horse snorting)

417
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:58,362
What kind of messenger
of Satan is he

418
00:25:58,395 --> 00:25:59,929
If his knees are knocking
together in fear?

419
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:09,329
He might just pass
with a good scrub.

420
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:17,362
(People murmuring)

421
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:26,529
(Low growling)

422
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:32,695
Master Sotnik.

423
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,829
He's alone.
There's no one else.

424
00:26:47,362 --> 00:26:49,929
A servant of Satan!

425
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:52,329
What's all this noise?

426
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,362
The Devil's scripture.

427
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:00,695
"Jonathan Green".

428
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:03,929
Jonathan Green.

429
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:05,929
Yes, yes, yes--
Jonathan Green!

430
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:08,595
Scientist, cartographer.

431
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,862
I am the subject of Her Majesty,

432
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:14,529
The Queen of England,

433
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:16,029
Recently renamed
the United Kingdom.

434
00:27:16,062 --> 00:27:18,029
MAN:
Not a scientist.

435
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:19,395
It's a pleasure
to meet you all.

436
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:24,762
If he's the best
his country has to offer,

437
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:27,662
We're in terrible trouble.

438
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:29,995
(People laughing)

439
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:32,495
(Growling)

440
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,562
"Looking through my spyglass,
I could well discern

441
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:39,829
Leaping savages
and their frantic gestures.

442
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:42,062
I was sure they were
preparing themselves

443
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:43,329
For a terrible meal
of human flesh."

444
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,895
What are you reading?

445
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:47,995
Shh.

446
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:50,695
This is the latest story
by Mister Defoe.

447
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,895
It's about the adventures
of Robinson Crusoe.

448
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:54,662
Of all the great writers
this country's produced,

449
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,295
You choose to read him.

450
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:58,729
(Baby cooing)

451
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,562
And what, Madam, is this?

452
00:28:01,595 --> 00:28:02,762
Father please,
give it back.

453
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:04,329
It's from him,
isn't it? Hm?

454
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:07,662
Cease any contact with
that worthless specimen.

455
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:10,462
I demand that in my own home
there is nothing

456
00:28:10,495 --> 00:28:11,495
To remind me
of the wretch.

457
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:12,995
Quiet, Father.

458
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,529
You are forgetting
that this wretch

459
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,329
Ha!
is the father of my child.

460
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,995
You never thought that
perhaps at this very moment

461
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,062
He is somewhere,
surrounded by savages,

462
00:28:20,095 --> 00:28:21,962
In deadly peril
on some desert island?

463
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:23,529
Savages?

464
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:25,662
Island? What island?

465
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:28,695
It is the biggest continent
of them all.

466
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:31,629
Your Mr. Jonathan
"I am a cartographer" Green

467
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:34,329
Is in the middle
of that continent.

468
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:36,529
A continent?

469
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:37,862
FATHER:
"Savages" my ass!

470
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:43,629
Excuse me Sir,
excuse me!

471
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:45,895
Um, I have some
very important equipment

472
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:47,462
Damaged in my carriage.

473
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:49,429
It's vital to me,
you understand.

474
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:51,395
It's the fifth
measuring wheel.

475
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,429
It measures distance.

476
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:53,662
The wheel?
Yes Sir.

477
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:55,395
Ah!

478
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:57,762
Our blacksmith's good at making
that kind of mechanism.

479
00:28:57,795 --> 00:28:59,895
Ah.
Let's go.

480
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:02,962
He made a contraption
that produces horilka,

481
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:05,729
A vodka so clear
it looks like tears.

482
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:07,929
Yes, I'm very well aware
of what horilka is.

483
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:09,462
It's not that, no no.

484
00:29:09,495 --> 00:29:11,495
It's a-- it's a
mechanical thing.

485
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:12,695
It's a mechanism.

486
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:14,329
Ah, same shit.

487
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:18,329
Did I invite the commons in?

488
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:19,895
It's me, Taras.

489
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:22,829
Wait! Here, I brought you
a British customer.

490
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:23,829
A scientist.

491
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:24,895
A scientist?

492
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,495
Yeah. Look at his carriage.

493
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,562
Hey, what do you think
of this, huh?

494
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:29,962
TARAS:
An impressive rig.

495
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,795
Yeah, if it moves
and turns on its own.

496
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:34,395
Think you can fix it?

497
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:39,362
It wasn't made by God,
so yeah.

498
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:40,462
No, no, no, no.

499
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:41,995
The work of Dutch masters.

500
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:45,329
The Dutch masters,
you say?

501
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:47,695
Heh. Well try this!

502
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:52,662
(Grunting)
Well, Mr. Scientist,

503
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:54,562
Remind you of anything?

504
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:55,929
Huh?

505
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,529
Oh!

506
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:03,295
It's like the drawings
of Leonardo Da Vinci.

507
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:04,795
I have no idea
what a Da Vinci is,

508
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:07,595
But I do know how
to make it fly.

509
00:30:07,629 --> 00:30:08,695
That I know.

510
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:09,829
Will it?

511
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:11,029
Yeah,

512
00:30:11,062 --> 00:30:13,695
But to land, not so much.

513
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,829
But first I invite the best
scientist to my house to eat.

514
00:30:15,862 --> 00:30:17,729
You can't say no.

515
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:19,429
It's been a long time since
we had a foreigner around here.

516
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:23,629
Will he repair it?

517
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:24,962
TARAS:
Your carriage will be fine.

518
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:26,429
(Voices trailing off)

519
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,795
Why are you shielding him?

520
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:33,629
Now that's not why
I called you here, Father.

521
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:36,395
It's been a whole year
since my darling daughter died.

522
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:40,362
Let's have her funeral
at the old church tomorrow.

523
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:43,895
My men can clear the road
in no time.

524
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,929
I didn't hear that.

525
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:47,495
Don't think it.

526
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:48,829
That road is closed.

527
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:50,929
I waited nine days,
and then forty days.

528
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:52,662
And now a full 12 months!

529
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:53,962
Pray to God.

530
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:56,962
Patience alone is nothing.

531
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:59,562
There's one thing
I still don't know.

532
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:02,362
What was it you saw
inside that church?

533
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:18,429
Petrus! Petrus!

534
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:21,729
Yes, Master Sotnik.

535
00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:23,695
What's this?
Read it to me.

536
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:27,629
It's a map of the area.

537
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,962
Aha.

538
00:31:29,995 --> 00:31:32,795
Go and bring him here,
that scientist.

539
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:35,762
Whoa.

540
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:36,862
But quietly.

541
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,629
(Jonathan singing quietly)

542
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:50,662
(Door creaking open)

543
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:55,729
Uh, excuse me?

544
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:58,329
Hello?

545
00:31:58,362 --> 00:31:59,595
Are you deaf?

546
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:00,695
Good, all right,
we're not speaking.

547
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:02,895
That's fine by me.

548
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:04,262
At least tell me your name.

549
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:26,329
The girl's struck dumb.

550
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:29,495
Mmm.

551
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:32,962
What delicate saplings
the Devil has brought me.

552
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:37,395
Would you like me to rub
your back when you're dry?

553
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:39,729
Thank you, but uh--

554
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:41,795
Hey!

555
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,729
The other students like it.

556
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,929
(Snickering)

557
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:48,862
(Nervous chuckling)

558
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:50,895
Spare us.

559
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:58,362
Of course.

560
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:01,495
The old woman,
Khoma Brut.

561
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:04,029
This is where it all happened.

562
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:23,829
*

563
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:25,695
Ah-- ooh!
Oh, hello.

564
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:27,529
(Chuckling)

565
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:29,062
If you're taking a flight,

566
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:31,262
You should dress first.

567
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:37,995
Look, is there
a problem? Hm?

568
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:40,029
Master Sotnik would like
to talk to you.

569
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,795
In secret. Shh.

570
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:48,762
(Door creaking)

571
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:51,929
Father, tell me
what is wrong.

572
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:54,395
Sotnik won't stop
asking questions.

573
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:55,729
(Scoffing)

574
00:33:55,762 --> 00:33:57,695
It has been over a year.

575
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:00,429
He's thinking of
ordering his labourers

576
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:02,795
To clear the roadway.

577
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:04,529
(Laughing)

578
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:06,895
I'd like to know which
of his labourers

579
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,529
He thinks is willing to risk his
skin around this cursed place!

580
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:11,462
Our village is gladly
short of heroes.

581
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:13,562
(Chuckling)

582
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,595
Outsiders then.

583
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,729
Master Sotnik,
the scientist.

584
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:27,929
Master Cartographer,

585
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:29,429
Do you believe in God?

586
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:30,995
How to put it?

587
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:33,562
I'm a scientist.

588
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:36,462
That means you don't
believe in the Devil.

589
00:34:36,495 --> 00:34:37,829
Um, no.

590
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:40,462
Ah, that's good.

591
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,495
I want you to make another map
like this one,

592
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:45,995
But put the church
at the centre.

593
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:48,562
So I can see all my land.

594
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,029
That's good.

595
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:51,295
I must tell you that uh,

596
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:53,295
It'll take time to um,

597
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:55,395
Complete.

598
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,962
For a thousand gold coins?

599
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,795
Where is Satan's messenger?

600
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,529
OVERKO:
My guess is he's holed up
at Hannah's water mill.

601
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,695
(Dog barking in distance)

602
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,662
Here, for a start.

603
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,495
I'll need uh, an assistant.

604
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,695
I'll get you one now.

605
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:17,995
Begin at the old church.

606
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:22,895
Let no one see you.

607
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:23,895
Master Sotnik,
the path is cleared.

608
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:25,629
We should go.

609
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,729
Come on, hurry up.

610
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:32,995
Yes, wait, wait.

611
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:35,295
Hurry!

612
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:36,595
(Horses whinnying)

613
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,795
My horse can see things
we can't.

614
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:40,562
There must be
a devil of sorts.

615
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:42,729
Come on, you stubborn beast!

616
00:35:42,762 --> 00:35:44,995
(Whip cracking)
Hyah!

617
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:50,795
(Growling)

618
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:54,429
About you talking to Sotnik-

619
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:55,995
Not a word to anyone.

620
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,762
It's better for us that way.

621
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,529
(Loon calling)

622
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,462
So, if Father Paisiy
is right--

623
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:06,629
Let's go see.

624
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:17,895
Where's the scientist?

625
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:19,695
He is here!

626
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,995
Master Scientist!

627
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,362
(Chuckling)

628
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:26,629
Let us pour some horilka
for our honoured guest.

629
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:29,495
Trust me, you've tasted
nothing like this!

630
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:34,029
YAVTUKH:
Smells good.

631
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:35,562
TARAS:
Everyone!

632
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:38,929
To us.
To us.

633
00:36:42,395 --> 00:36:44,329
Ah!

634
00:36:44,362 --> 00:36:45,829
So what science
do you do? Huh?

635
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,462
Look, Panas,

636
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:49,029
You were talking.

637
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:50,429
Right? You're an expert.

638
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:51,562
On scientists.

639
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:53,429
Well I've heard there are some

640
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:54,529
Who stare at the stars.

641
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:56,629
What kind of science is that?

642
00:36:56,662 --> 00:36:57,629
Stargazing science?

643
00:36:57,662 --> 00:36:59,629
I know what I am talking about.

644
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:01,562
They stare.

645
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,729
They stare at the stars
through glasses, like this.

646
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:04,962
Huh? Huh?

647
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:06,062
Ah!

648
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:07,929
(Men laughing)

649
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:09,395
Hey Taras, this is empty!

650
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:12,629
Trouble.

651
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:14,395
That's what we got
from the last scientist.

652
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:16,062
He changed our village,

653
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:17,695
And not for the better.

654
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:18,729
He was a philosopher.

655
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:19,929
Khoma Brut.

656
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:21,629
Brutus.

657
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:24,862
(Suspenseful music)

658
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:34,629
Tell me how you happen

659
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,629
To know Khoma Brutus.

660
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:41,595
He's well known.

661
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:43,962
Everyone knows that name.

662
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,929
He's known, all right.

663
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:49,995
Master Sotnik had heard the name
of a seminary student

664
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:53,295
In our village,
a student by the name

665
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:54,862
Of Khoma Brutus.

666
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:58,029
Please let me go.

667
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,929
OVERKO:
Dorosh and I delivered Khoma

668
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:02,062
To watch over
Sotnik's daughter.

669
00:38:02,095 --> 00:38:04,895
Dogs were barking,
wolves howling.

670
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,662
(Whispering)
Holy Mother of God.

671
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:23,629
Through the priest and through
our Lord Jesus Christ,

672
00:38:23,662 --> 00:38:26,395
Our one true God,
forgive us our sins.

673
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,629
Amen.

674
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:33,895
* We beg you oh Lord
to embrace in us *

675
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:36,862
* In the eternal life
that is given to you *

676
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:39,929
* And your blessed ministry

677
00:38:39,962 --> 00:38:41,562
* In the name of the Father,
and the Son *

678
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:43,529
* Amen

679
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:48,929
What sort of a priest would I be
if I was afraid of a corpse?

680
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:51,462
Oh, I wish I could
smoke in here.

681
00:38:55,762 --> 00:38:58,295
Ah.

682
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:02,495
Oh, good tobacco.

683
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:11,062
Her face.

684
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:14,795
Her beautiful face
draws me to her.

685
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:17,329
(Breathing heavily)

686
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:20,895
Even in death, so beautiful.

687
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:36,529
(Laboured breathing)

688
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,862
(Wind whooshing)

689
00:40:08,695 --> 00:40:11,295
(Stretching noises)

690
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:34,762
*

691
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:57,429
*

692
00:40:57,462 --> 00:41:00,529
(Bell tolling)

693
00:41:00,562 --> 00:41:02,562
(Bell silenced)

694
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:17,529
*

695
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:22,395
(Shrieking)

696
00:41:28,395 --> 00:41:43,329
*

697
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:03,662
(Rooster crowing)

698
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:24,962
JONATHAN:
Listen, where is this church?

699
00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:26,529
Hm?

700
00:42:26,562 --> 00:42:28,995
Tell us why do you
want to know.

701
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:31,495
Well, Master Sotnik and I
were thinking of maybe,

702
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:33,962
You know.

703
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:35,762
Pfft, forget it.
It's nothing.

704
00:42:35,795 --> 00:42:37,362
Chalk is the most
important thing we own.

705
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:39,595
Draw a circle around you

706
00:42:39,629 --> 00:42:41,529
And not even the Devil
can touch you.

707
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,695
Or a witch.

708
00:42:47,062 --> 00:42:49,295
All women are witches

709
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:51,462
And they have small,
curly tails.

710
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:53,362
Who's that food for?

711
00:42:53,395 --> 00:42:55,395
Are you going
to the the swamp?
Is that true?

712
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:56,495
JONATHAN:
Well, it's a superstition.
Don't you dare--

713
00:42:56,529 --> 00:43:00,295
Legends. Imagination.

714
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:03,695
PANAS:
Maybe not in Europe, but here,

715
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:05,862
All women are witches.

716
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:14,929
JONATHAN:
Yavtukh, he's drinking.

717
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:16,695
Hey!

718
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:18,595
(Men grunting and singing)

719
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,829
(Singing indistinctly)

720
00:43:26,695 --> 00:43:36,562
*

721
00:43:36,595 --> 00:43:38,662
(Singing continues)

722
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:44,895
(Gunshot)

723
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:46,595
(Music and singing stops)

724
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:47,662
It's supposed to be a song!

725
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:49,862
Stop tearing your throats out!

726
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:51,562
What?

727
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,695
TARAS:
Don't like it, too bad!

728
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:56,395
Who do you think you are,
giving us orders?

729
00:43:56,429 --> 00:43:57,762
And since when
are you in charge--

730
00:43:57,795 --> 00:43:58,962
Whoa, whoa!

731
00:43:58,995 --> 00:44:01,029
Let me go!

732
00:44:01,062 --> 00:44:02,662
(Groaning)

733
00:44:02,695 --> 00:44:04,795
(Mumbling)

734
00:44:06,629 --> 00:44:07,829
No, no, no,
don't go!
Shh.

735
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:09,962
We're just getting
started here.

736
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,995
Don't spoil this.

737
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:13,662
You'll insult us.

738
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,662
Was there any evidence
of Khoma's fate?

739
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,829
Evidence?

740
00:44:19,895 --> 00:44:21,062
Here it is.

741
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:23,795
Evidence I saw
with my own eyes.

742
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,462
But thanks to the curse,

743
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,962
I have only the one now.

744
00:44:27,995 --> 00:44:29,862
My other is gone.

745
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:33,995
Now listen to the rest.

746
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,895
It's always scary,
the first night.

747
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:50,529
I'm not scared.

748
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,762
I'm not scared now.

749
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:54,429
Help me, Lord.

750
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,329
Okay.

751
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:02,762
(Axe hammering)

752
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,495
(Thunder crashing)

753
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,929
(Thunder rumbling outside)

754
00:45:42,962 --> 00:45:45,495
(Wood creaking)

755
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:05,695
(Crashing)

756
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:25,962
*

757
00:46:25,995 --> 00:46:28,562
Help me, God!

758
00:46:28,595 --> 00:46:30,995
Ahh!

759
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:42,262
Ugh!

760
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:51,662
(Crashing)

761
00:46:51,695 --> 00:46:54,995
(Whooshing)

762
00:46:59,595 --> 00:47:01,829
(Slow motion humming)

763
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:04,062
(Thudding)

764
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:05,762
(Groaning)

765
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:11,895

766
00:47:17,995 --> 00:47:19,662
(Echoed shrieking)

767
00:47:23,662 --> 00:47:26,629
(Shrieking)

768
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,895
Aahhh!

769
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:39,495
Aahh!

770
00:47:39,529 --> 00:47:41,862
(Slow motion humming)

771
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:49,795
(Satanic whispering noises)

772
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:51,295
(Grunting)

773
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:54,929
(Shrieking)

774
00:47:59,495 --> 00:48:01,695
(Rooster crowing)

775

776
00:48:07,995 --> 00:48:10,629
(Groaning)

777
00:48:26,462 --> 00:48:28,695
(Squeaking)

778
00:48:32,795 --> 00:48:34,595
(Gagging)

779
00:48:34,629 --> 00:48:35,962
(Squeaking)

780
00:48:43,595 --> 00:48:44,662
(Snarling)

781
00:48:44,695 --> 00:48:46,829
(Creatures squeaking)

782
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:53,662
(Gagging noises)

783
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:56,495

784

789
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:31,662
(Roaring)

790
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:46,762
(Growling)

791
00:49:46,795 --> 00:49:47,862
TARAS:
I can't see him.

792
00:49:47,895 --> 00:49:50,729
Where is he?

793
00:49:50,762 --> 00:49:52,495
He's under the table.

794
00:49:56,562 --> 00:49:59,662
My ears must be clogged.

795
00:49:59,695 --> 00:50:02,562
He kicked my head!

796
00:50:02,595 --> 00:50:04,562
(Cackling)

797
00:50:11,629 --> 00:50:14,929
Look, he wants to run.

798
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:25,462
(Shattering)

799
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:29,329

(Creatures screaming)

801
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:37,962
Ah.

802
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:57,462
I can't see anything!

803
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:03,595
Don't let him get to the chalk.

804
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:04,762
Turn around.

805
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:10,729
Keep him away from the chalk.

806
00:51:12,429 --> 00:51:14,462
The chalk!

807
00:51:14,495 --> 00:51:15,929
Somebody!

808
00:51:15,962 --> 00:51:17,729
Get him!

809
00:51:17,762 --> 00:51:20,429
Don't let him have the chalk!

810
00:51:35,862 --> 00:51:38,429
Pick up my head.

811
00:51:42,662 --> 00:51:44,929
I don't see him.

812
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:49,629
Get him.

813
00:51:52,062 --> 00:51:55,395
There you stay.

814
00:52:02,395 --> 00:52:04,395
Pannochka!

815
00:52:06,629 --> 00:52:07,762
(Cackling)

816
00:52:09,095 --> 00:52:10,429
Pannochka.

817
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:17,895
PANNOCHKA:
Can't find him.

818
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:20,029
Can't see.

819
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:26,529
I call upon you, Viy!

820
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:28,929
Viy!

821
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:35,495
(Chittering)

822
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:37,629
(Rumbling)

823
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:43,029
(Bubbling)

824
00:52:58,695 --> 00:53:01,029
(Squeaking)

825
00:53:12,629 --> 00:53:14,762
(Panting)

826
00:53:14,795 --> 00:53:18,629
DEEP SATANIC VOICE:
Open my eyes.

827
00:53:35,529 --> 00:53:37,462
(Growling)

828
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:41,329
Now he belongs to you.

829
00:53:50,062 --> 00:53:52,462
(Whispering)
We need you to find

830
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,062
Who's inside the skin.

831
00:53:54,095 --> 00:53:57,595
Show that soul

832
00:53:57,629 --> 00:54:00,529
And I will leave you
among the living.

833
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:18,462
(Rooster crowing)

834
00:54:41,629 --> 00:54:45,495
WOMAN:
So, you saw the monster.

835
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:49,395
There are many.

836
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:54,362
They live in
and among the people.

837
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:55,995
You do not carry a cross,

838
00:54:56,029 --> 00:55:00,062
But when your scientific
reasoning fails you

839
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,929
You hide behind
the chalk circle.

840
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:12,029
Do as she asks.

841
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:15,962
Find out who is in
the sheep's skin.

842
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:20,329
Help her find her way.

843
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:22,929
By doing so,
you will find yours.

844
00:55:30,362 --> 00:55:31,862
(Birds chirping outside)

845
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,862
Master Scientist,

846
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:36,662
Master Sotnik is, uh,

847
00:55:36,695 --> 00:55:38,895
Very angry.

848
00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:44,962
(Crowing)

849
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,795
Give me that.

850
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:10,662
What's become
of the scientist?

851
00:56:10,695 --> 00:56:13,362
He's gone.

852
00:56:13,395 --> 00:56:14,929
So, he packed his things,

853
00:56:14,962 --> 00:56:16,462
Ran out of the village

854
00:56:16,495 --> 00:56:18,429
And ran off.

855
00:56:20,495 --> 00:56:22,695
That foreign scientist,

856
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:24,962
Satan's messenger has gone

857
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:26,795
To the forbidden church.

858
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:28,862
Speak up, little one.

859
00:56:28,895 --> 00:56:30,762
What's going to happen
to us, my Father?

860
00:56:30,795 --> 00:56:32,562
Get ready.
Gather the people.

861
00:56:32,595 --> 00:56:33,995
Save us, Father Paisiy.

862
00:56:34,029 --> 00:56:35,629
WOMAN:
What are we going to do?

863
00:56:35,662 --> 00:56:37,662
Why the hell do you think
he went into the forest?

864
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:38,895
Sniffing for your treasure.

865
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,329
Well it's really not funny.

866
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:42,829
What if he goes
inside the church?

867
00:56:44,495 --> 00:56:45,662
Then when Sotnik asks,

868
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:48,695
"Did you happen to see

869
00:56:48,729 --> 00:56:50,695
The thousand gold coins
meant for Khoma?

870
00:56:50,729 --> 00:56:53,362
The ones I dropped in fear?"

871
00:56:53,395 --> 00:56:54,829
Oh yes.

872
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:56,595
I saw you.

873
00:56:56,629 --> 00:56:57,995
You took them.

874
00:56:59,995 --> 00:57:01,695
I'll hold it close,

875
00:57:01,729 --> 00:57:03,529
Just as any confession.

876
00:57:03,562 --> 00:57:05,662
Go.

877
00:57:11,029 --> 00:57:12,862
Master Scientist,

878
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:15,895
You can do as you like,
but I won't go in.

879
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:18,329
Some assistant, eh?

880
00:57:20,495 --> 00:57:22,362
Look, at least
hold the rope for me.

881
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:24,562
Do I have to?

882
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,762
Petrus! Hold it tighter.

883
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,295
I'll look around the swamp,

884
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:41,895
While you go and
check out the church.

885
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:54,329
*

886
00:57:59,029 --> 00:58:00,429
(Grunting)

887
00:58:07,595 --> 00:58:20,362
*

888
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:35,629
(Grunting)

889
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,029
(Rumbling)

890
00:58:50,829 --> 00:58:52,629
First I'll buy you
some new reins.

891
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,895
And a saddle.

892
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:00,762
(Bird calling)

893
00:59:03,462 --> 00:59:04,795
Here goes.

894
00:59:12,862 --> 00:59:15,395
We have enough for everything.

895
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:16,729
Look at this.

896
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,562
(Chuckling)

897
00:59:18,595 --> 00:59:20,662
Look how much money we've got!

898
00:59:23,362 --> 00:59:24,495
Hold it tight!

899
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:26,595
(Jonathan 's voice ringing out)

900
00:59:31,995 --> 00:59:34,362
What am I doing?

901
00:59:34,395 --> 00:59:35,762
This is crazy.

902
00:59:46,062 --> 00:59:48,295
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

903
01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:10,595
Petrus!

904
01:00:10,629 --> 01:00:11,762
Pull my stuff up!

905
01:00:11,795 --> 01:00:14,362
I'm gonna spend all day here.

906
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:17,995
You just stay there.

907
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:22,962
Let's get Overko.

908
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,029
(Horse whinnying softly)

909
01:00:24,062 --> 01:00:26,595
Quiet!

910
01:00:38,762 --> 01:00:41,662
JONATHAN:
 I can only suppose

911
01:00:41,695 --> 01:00:43,895
That it was the shock
 of the last few days

912
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:46,895
And my body's tiredness
 that so completely distorted

913
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:49,029
My first impressions.

914
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,495
They remind me of pirates.

915
01:00:50,529 --> 01:00:52,495
Have I frightened you,
 my dear?

916
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:54,395
No no, my darling.

917
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:57,362
You see, first impressions
 are sometimes deceptive.

918
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:03,429
(Chuckling)

919
01:01:03,462 --> 01:01:05,895
DOROSH:
Overko!

920
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:08,529
To hell with you.

921
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:10,495
Overko.

922
01:01:12,329 --> 01:01:13,329
What are you doing
over there?

923
01:01:13,362 --> 01:01:14,762
What news, brother?

924
01:01:14,795 --> 01:01:15,962
I found him.
I found him at the old church.

925
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:17,895
Oh. Let's get him then.

926
01:01:17,929 --> 01:01:20,295
Sure, just as soon as you
hide our money, right?

927
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:21,329
(Laughing)

928
01:01:21,362 --> 01:01:22,729
(Grumbling)

929
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:26,329
Go tell Paisiy,
and I'll head to the church!

930
01:01:46,929 --> 01:01:48,662
Well Father,

931
01:01:48,695 --> 01:01:50,429
We rode to the church

932
01:01:50,462 --> 01:01:52,862
And there he was
on the roof.

933
01:01:52,895 --> 01:01:54,462
And Petrus was there with him.

934
01:01:54,495 --> 01:01:56,962
I had Overko stay and watch.

935
01:01:56,995 --> 01:01:58,529
That scientist
finds anything,

936
01:01:58,562 --> 01:01:59,795
He'll get a knife
in the back.

937
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:01,295
Well?

938
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:03,862
What should our next move be?

939
01:02:03,895 --> 01:02:06,429
Hear me, Sotnik.

940
01:02:06,462 --> 01:02:08,762
While you know this,

941
01:02:08,795 --> 01:02:11,962
The villagers
are ready to act

942
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:14,029
And execute the unholy.

943
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:17,695
You want a requiem for your
daughter, Master Sotnik?

944
01:02:17,729 --> 01:02:19,729
You'll have it.

945
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:45,862
Wait here
and see what happens.

946
01:03:00,862 --> 01:03:02,529
This is not a priest speaking

947
01:03:02,562 --> 01:03:04,729
With the power to punish
and judge you.

948
01:03:04,762 --> 01:03:06,029
No.

949
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:08,429
You see a simple servant,

950
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:10,629
That's all.

951
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:11,895
A worm anyone can tread on.

952
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:13,595
That's what I
needed to hear.

953
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:15,729
But this servant,
this worm implores you,

954
01:03:15,762 --> 01:03:16,762
Do not--

955
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:18,029
Ah--

956
01:03:18,062 --> 01:03:19,695
--do not seek explanations,

957
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,029
For all that's in
this firmament

958
01:03:22,062 --> 01:03:24,729
Is revealed to you--
It's a miracle.

959
01:03:24,762 --> 01:03:27,562
Let others say that
you live in darkness,

960
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,362
That you are ignorant.

961
01:03:29,395 --> 01:03:31,895
I say to seek to know all
of God's work as heresy,

962
01:03:31,929 --> 01:03:33,662
So let go of the false
light of knowledge.

963
01:03:33,695 --> 01:03:35,962
It does not serve our God.

964
01:03:37,629 --> 01:03:39,595
What's wrong, Master Sotnik?

965
01:03:39,629 --> 01:03:42,562
Has the truth of God
made you uncomfortable?

966
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:46,295
Have you no love
for Christ's flock?

967
01:03:49,595 --> 01:03:51,662
Yes, that's us.
"The flock".

968
01:03:53,395 --> 01:03:55,829
PAISIY:
Ah, Master Sotnik is fallen

969
01:03:55,862 --> 01:03:58,495
Victim to his crime,

970
01:03:58,529 --> 01:03:59,862
And the influence of those

971
01:03:59,895 --> 01:04:02,629
Who've declared themselves
all-knowing!

972
01:04:02,662 --> 01:04:05,529
OVERKO:
You just stay there,
Master Scientist.

973
01:04:05,562 --> 01:04:08,795
Stay there.

974
01:04:08,829 --> 01:04:10,529
Fear the learned outsiders!

975
01:04:10,562 --> 01:04:12,729
I see how Satan's army
is getting ever nearer.

976
01:04:30,962 --> 01:04:33,729
(Suspenseful music)

977
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:37,729
(Squawking)

978
01:04:37,762 --> 01:04:40,995
(Playing lively tune)

979
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:43,362
Banish the evil ones from here,

980
01:04:43,395 --> 01:04:44,495
So that the ground burns up

981
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:45,762
Under their feet!

982
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:47,662
Hallelujah!

983
01:04:47,695 --> 01:04:50,295
TOWNSPEOPLE CHANTING:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

984
01:04:53,895 --> 01:04:55,662
Whoa!

985
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:02,429
(Grunting)

986
01:05:10,029 --> 01:05:11,295
Ah! Ah!

987
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:12,295
Aaah!

988
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:14,295
Oof.

989
01:05:16,862 --> 01:05:18,995
Ah!

990
01:05:20,862 --> 01:05:22,629
(Grunting)

991
01:05:22,662 --> 01:05:24,729
I-- I didn't intend

992
01:05:24,762 --> 01:05:27,062
To come down
quite so quickly.

993
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:28,862
Lift me up, Petrus.

994
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:30,329
Petrus, lift me up!

995
01:05:30,362 --> 01:05:31,395
Agh!

996
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:32,529
Gah!

997
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:35,329
(Grunting)

998
01:05:35,362 --> 01:05:37,962
(Panting)

999
01:05:37,995 --> 01:05:39,495
Master, I told you
this place is cursed--

1000
01:05:39,529 --> 01:05:41,529
I don't care.
I need my instruments!

1001
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,662
Just-- Petrus--
Petrus I've got--

1002
01:05:43,695 --> 01:05:44,729
We need to know
the way.

1003
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:45,795
Petrus, what--

1004
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:46,995
Agh! Petrus!

1005
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:48,329
Let's go.

1006
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:49,329
Petrus, let me
get back up--

1007
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,362
Run away!

1008
01:05:50,395 --> 01:05:51,729
I-- Ugh!

1009
01:05:51,762 --> 01:05:52,729
Run away!

1010
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:54,895
(Horse snorting)

1011
01:05:56,029 --> 01:06:07,762
*

1012
01:06:12,395 --> 01:06:13,462
Hallelujah!

1013
01:06:13,495 --> 01:06:14,629
ALL:
Hallelujah!

1014
01:06:14,662 --> 01:06:16,662
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1015
01:06:16,695 --> 01:06:19,029
Hallelujah!

1016
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:20,429
Hallelujah!

1017
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:24,495
(Children shouting)

1018
01:06:24,529 --> 01:06:26,362
Master Scientist,

1019
01:06:26,395 --> 01:06:27,462
Go to Sotnik's house.

1020
01:06:27,495 --> 01:06:29,329
You'll be safe there.

1021
01:06:29,362 --> 01:06:30,795
You little pests!
Go on!

1022
01:06:33,362 --> 01:06:34,395
What did you see there?

1023
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:37,562
There's devilry here.

1024
01:06:37,595 --> 01:06:38,962
You've joined them.

1025
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,929
You haven't been there!

1026
01:06:40,962 --> 01:06:45,295
Do not consort
with the scientist, any of you.

1027
01:06:45,329 --> 01:06:46,662
Or the Lord's curse
be upon you!

1028
01:06:46,695 --> 01:06:48,662
Get out.

1029
01:06:48,695 --> 01:06:49,729
Without my instruments?

1030
01:06:49,762 --> 01:06:51,862
You heard me.

1031
01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:53,062
Finish the job you started.

1032
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:54,695
Or be flayed alive.

1033
01:07:05,695 --> 01:07:09,062
Agghhh!

1034
01:07:09,095 --> 01:07:11,495
What?

1035
01:07:11,529 --> 01:07:12,962
You said Overko
would watch him.

1036
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,629
Who?
He's back again!

1037
01:07:14,662 --> 01:07:15,895
And he's not alone.

1038
01:07:15,929 --> 01:07:17,295
He's with
Sotnik's servant.

1039
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:18,362
Who?

1040
01:07:18,395 --> 01:07:19,962
"Who"?
Who do you think?

1041
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:21,395
Go now and
bring him to me.

1042
01:07:21,429 --> 01:07:22,829
Uh-huh.

1043
01:07:24,895 --> 01:07:26,029
So who again?

1044
01:07:26,062 --> 01:07:28,262
Petrus, of course!

1045
01:07:30,595 --> 01:07:31,729
Ah-- agh!

1046
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:35,562
PAISIY:
Sit him down.

1047
01:07:35,595 --> 01:07:36,895
(Panting)

1048
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:37,895
Dorosh, what are you doing?

1049
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,462
No no-- Ah!

1050
01:07:39,495 --> 01:07:41,595
What are you doing?

1051
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:43,795
Aaahh!

1052
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:45,495
Dorosh, shut him up

1053
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:46,595
Or we'll have the
whole village on our hands.

1054
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:48,595
(Muffled noises from Petrus)

1055
01:07:50,895 --> 01:07:51,929
Dorosh, no--

1056
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:53,395
No, get the other one.

1057
01:07:53,429 --> 01:07:55,029
What's that?
Dorosh no, please!

1058
01:07:55,062 --> 01:07:56,862
This isn't funny.

1059
01:07:56,895 --> 01:07:58,995
Can we talk about this?

1060
01:07:59,029 --> 01:08:00,029
I-- I beg you.

1061
01:08:00,062 --> 01:08:01,795
Oh that-- Aaaagghh!

1062
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:03,762
What did the scientist
do at the church?

1063
01:08:03,795 --> 01:08:06,929
Tell us why he was there and
what was he trying to find?

1064
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:08,929
(Straining)

1065
01:08:08,962 --> 01:08:10,962
Master Sotnik sent him,
to make a map.

1066
01:08:10,995 --> 01:08:12,729
(Panting)

1067
01:08:12,762 --> 01:08:14,929
And the fee was
a thousand gold coins.

1068
01:08:14,962 --> 01:08:18,529
It's lying around
the church somewhere.

1069
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:21,362
PAISIY:
Good boy. Good boy.

1070
01:08:21,395 --> 01:08:22,662
Ungh!

1071
01:08:22,695 --> 01:08:24,495
(Groaning)

1072
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:26,962
From now on you'll report

1073
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:28,895
Everything you hear to me.

1074
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:37,662
Put this on
and leave it on.

1075
01:08:37,695 --> 01:08:40,062
And no questions.

1076
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:42,029
Now get out of here!

1077
01:08:42,062 --> 01:08:44,495
I'll run away first,
before I serve you!

1078
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:46,862
Find the scientist and
don't lose sight of him.

1079
01:08:57,562 --> 01:08:59,495
Let's go and find Overko.

1080
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:01,029
(Sighing)

1081
01:09:01,062 --> 01:09:02,062
Aagh!

1082
01:09:02,095 --> 01:09:04,695
(Bell clanging)

1083
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:08,629
(Villagers shouting)

1084
01:09:08,662 --> 01:09:09,929
Come on!

1085
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:11,862
(Bell clanging in distance)

1086
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:19,795
Master Scientist,
they're coming--

1087
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:21,362
What's wrong?

1088
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:22,862
Paisiy sent them.
Things could get very nasty.

1089
01:09:22,895 --> 01:09:24,429
So you've got to run away now,

1090
01:09:24,462 --> 01:09:25,595
And I'll run with you.

1091
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:26,695
You are?

1092
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,295
I have only one condition.

1093
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:31,329
I'm taking Nastusya
with us.

1094
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:38,929
(Whispering)
Put your things together.

1095
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:40,295
We're running away.

1096
01:09:40,329 --> 01:09:42,495
Just take things you need.

1097
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:44,029
I've got food.

1098
01:09:44,062 --> 01:09:46,762
You're not going to starve
but you have to hurry.

1099
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:52,329
(Snoring)

1100
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:53,662
(Whispering)
Perhaps you don't want to go.

1101
01:09:53,695 --> 01:09:55,995
In that case,

1102
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:57,295
I'll just have to uh,

1103
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:59,329
Kidnap you.

1104
01:10:01,362 --> 01:10:02,862
I'll kidnap you and tie you up

1105
01:10:02,895 --> 01:10:03,895
With this rope.

1106
01:10:03,929 --> 01:10:05,595
I'll do it.

1107
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:07,462
I swear I'll do it.

1108
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:10,629
I hope you'll come,
Nastusya.

1109
01:10:10,662 --> 01:10:12,662
Do you want to?

1110
01:10:15,329 --> 01:10:17,429
All right then,
it's goodbye.

1111
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:22,695
One day you'll hear

1112
01:10:22,729 --> 01:10:25,362
That some foreign mercenary

1113
01:10:25,395 --> 01:10:27,295
Beheaded the brave
Cossack Petrus.

1114
01:10:27,329 --> 01:10:29,562
Farewell.

1115
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:33,495
Nastusya.

1116
01:10:35,495 --> 01:10:36,662
My love.

1117
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:37,862
My true darling.

1118
01:10:37,895 --> 01:10:39,029
Petrus!

1119
01:10:39,062 --> 01:10:40,329
Come on!

1120
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:42,595
We'll steal a boat.

1121
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:43,795
Be ready.

1122
01:10:49,362 --> 01:10:51,629
Overko!

1123
01:10:54,962 --> 01:10:56,929
Overko!

1124
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:00,695
Where are you?

1125
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:02,429
Brother!

1126
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:04,395
Huagh!

1127
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:06,562
(Horse whinnying)

1128
01:11:11,429 --> 01:11:14,429
(Grunting)

1129
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:17,062
Are you crazy?

1130
01:11:17,095 --> 01:11:18,295
You could have killed my horse!

1131
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:19,829
I'll kill you!

1132
01:11:19,862 --> 01:11:20,929
Ah, you rotten swine!

1133
01:11:20,962 --> 01:11:22,462
You're no better.

1134
01:11:22,495 --> 01:11:23,495
I know you stole it.

1135
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,529
Where have you hidden it?

1136
01:11:25,562 --> 01:11:26,729
(Grunting)

1137
01:11:28,662 --> 01:11:30,395
I didn't steal it.

1138
01:11:30,429 --> 01:11:32,029
You've completely lost your mind
over all that money.

1139
01:11:32,062 --> 01:11:34,462
Such smart words from
a traitor and a thief!

1140
01:11:34,495 --> 01:11:35,729
Hyah!

1141
01:11:35,762 --> 01:11:38,029
(Grunting)

1142
01:11:38,062 --> 01:11:40,995
Hah!

1143
01:11:41,029 --> 01:11:42,762
Well Brother,

1144
01:11:42,795 --> 01:11:44,395
Anything to say before
I cut out your tongue?

1145
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:45,929
Why don't we--

1146
01:11:45,962 --> 01:11:47,862
Settle this over a smoke, huh?

1147
01:11:47,895 --> 01:11:49,562
(Chuckling)

1148
01:11:49,595 --> 01:11:50,629
What do you say?

1149
01:11:50,662 --> 01:11:53,495
I like that better.

1150
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:55,362
(Chuckling)

1151
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,595
Oh, I dropped my pipe.

1152
01:11:57,629 --> 01:11:58,795
It's gotta be around here
somewhere.

1153
01:11:58,829 --> 01:11:59,995
Where's my pipe?

1154
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:01,395
Huh?

1155
01:12:01,429 --> 01:12:03,395
Overko!

1156
01:12:04,762 --> 01:12:05,929
Overko!

1157
01:12:10,695 --> 01:12:11,929
(Loon calling)

1158
01:12:29,962 --> 01:12:31,329
Nastusya--

1159
01:12:31,362 --> 01:12:32,529
JONATHAN:
Petrus, come here.

1160
01:12:32,562 --> 01:12:34,762
PETRUS:
Nastusya, this way.

1161
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:43,429
Petrus?

1162
01:12:43,462 --> 01:12:44,429
Row to the dead tree.

1163
01:12:44,462 --> 01:12:45,595
I'll follow you.

1164
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:47,562
JONATHAN:
Where are you going?

1165
01:12:49,429 --> 01:12:51,562
(Drunken singing)

1166
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:01,562
(Taras' singing continues)

1167
01:13:07,862 --> 01:13:08,962
Nastusya!

1168
01:13:08,995 --> 01:13:10,695
Overko!

1169
01:13:10,729 --> 01:13:12,629
How many times have we
saved each other's necks?

1170
01:13:12,662 --> 01:13:15,895
Look at us now.

1171
01:13:18,729 --> 01:13:20,429
Nastusya.

1172
01:13:24,795 --> 01:13:27,529
Nastusya.

1173
01:13:29,695 --> 01:13:31,595
Let us redeem our sins,

1174
01:13:31,629 --> 01:13:33,529
And give the money back
to Sotnik.

1175
01:13:33,562 --> 01:13:36,462
Remember the good old days?

1176
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,695
Just two brothers
with free spirits.

1177
01:13:38,729 --> 01:13:41,562
Nastusya?

1178
01:13:42,895 --> 01:13:44,862
(Growling)
Oh! Ah!

1179
01:13:44,895 --> 01:13:46,895
(Panting)

1180
01:13:46,929 --> 01:13:48,629
Who's there?

1181
01:13:48,662 --> 01:13:50,029
Come out so I can--

1182
01:13:50,062 --> 01:13:51,729
(Grunting)

1183
01:13:58,962 --> 01:14:02,362
Lovely pipe,
isn't it?

1184
01:14:02,395 --> 01:14:04,562
I believe it is yours.

1185
01:14:04,595 --> 01:14:06,762
Well, aren't you wondering
where I found it?

1186
01:14:06,795 --> 01:14:09,529
(Struggling for breath)
Brother--

1187
01:14:12,829 --> 01:14:16,029
(Townsfolk shouting)

1188
01:14:16,062 --> 01:14:17,795
Viy!

1189
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:19,462
(Panting)

1190
01:14:19,495 --> 01:14:20,562
Viy. Viy.

1191
01:14:20,595 --> 01:14:22,929
Viy. He's back.

1192
01:14:22,962 --> 01:14:24,662
Where?

1193
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:25,795
Down there in the swamp.

1194
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:27,295
Viy!
I saw him, I saw him!

1195
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,329
The time has now come!

1196
01:14:29,362 --> 01:14:31,029
(Shouting)

1197
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:34,395
Let us drive away the Devil's
spawn with fire and sword!

1198
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:36,395
In the name of God!

1199
01:14:38,495 --> 01:14:39,595
The money, there.

1200
01:14:39,629 --> 01:14:40,795
There is the rest.

1201
01:14:40,829 --> 01:14:43,695
Ah--

1202
01:14:47,462 --> 01:14:50,595
Ah, the dumb girl.

1203
01:14:50,629 --> 01:14:53,795
Do you know
how lucky you are

1204
01:14:53,829 --> 01:14:56,962
That you're dumb?

1205
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:01,529
Where is it?

1206
01:15:01,562 --> 01:15:03,929
Where is the money?

1207
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:04,995
Give it to me.

1208
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:08,295
(Dogs barking, men shouting)

1209
01:15:09,762 --> 01:15:11,929
Come.

1210
01:15:11,962 --> 01:15:13,929
Here, take this.

1211
01:15:13,962 --> 01:15:14,929
Don't kill me!

1212
01:15:14,962 --> 01:15:16,762
She's trying to kill me!

1213
01:15:16,795 --> 01:15:17,962
She killed Dorosh!

1214
01:15:17,995 --> 01:15:19,362
Hold the witch!

1215
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:21,795
She's the spawn of Satan!

1216
01:15:22,895 --> 01:15:25,362
(People shouting in distance)

1217
01:15:26,662 --> 01:15:28,495
Nastusya, my love--

1218
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:29,662
Nastusya!

1219
01:15:29,695 --> 01:15:31,962
(Shouting continues)

1220
01:15:34,529 --> 01:15:36,595
Holy Father,

1221
01:15:36,629 --> 01:15:38,295
It wasn't Nastusya,
I sweat it wasn't!

1222
01:15:38,329 --> 01:15:40,529
I saw it with my own eyes,
standing there,

1223
01:15:40,562 --> 01:15:42,562
I saw the monster
with seven horns!

1224
01:15:42,595 --> 01:15:43,829
It wasn't her.

1225
01:15:43,862 --> 01:15:46,762
I saw him.
I saw the monster!

1226
01:15:48,062 --> 01:15:49,029
It wasn't Nastusya.

1227
01:15:49,062 --> 01:15:50,329
It was the monster!

1228
01:15:50,362 --> 01:15:51,329
But my son,
she's a witch.

1229
01:15:51,362 --> 01:15:52,662
Oh, what have I done?!

1230
01:15:57,962 --> 01:15:59,695
(Growling)

1231
01:15:59,729 --> 01:16:01,462
Agh!

1232
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:08,495
(Muffled screaming)

1233
01:16:12,062 --> 01:16:14,429
(Shouting)

1234
01:16:16,462 --> 01:16:18,429
What are you doing
to my daughter?!

1235
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:22,995
Ungh!

1236
01:16:31,095 --> 01:16:46,029
*

1237
01:16:51,562 --> 01:16:53,029
(Grunting)

1238
01:16:53,062 --> 01:16:55,562
Agh!

1239
01:16:55,595 --> 01:16:57,962
(Indiscernible shouting)

1240
01:16:57,995 --> 01:16:59,595
I'm gonna kill you!

1241
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:10,262
(Shouting in distance)

1242
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:22,529
She will die.

1243
01:17:32,462 --> 01:17:34,395
(Screaming)

1244
01:17:40,629 --> 01:17:42,362
You used me.

1245
01:17:42,395 --> 01:17:44,495
You didn't even want the map,
did you?

1246
01:17:44,529 --> 01:17:46,462
It was about your daughter,

1247
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,962
And the way she died.

1248
01:17:48,995 --> 01:17:50,329
What did you find out?

1249
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:52,762
I know what happened
to her.

1250
01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:02,595
You found out who
was under the skin?

1251
01:18:02,629 --> 01:18:04,562
(Horses whinnying)

1252
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:05,962
Calm him the hell down!

1253
01:18:07,795 --> 01:18:10,862
That beast understands
everything.

1254
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:14,429
Just find out
and I don't care how.

1255
01:18:14,462 --> 01:18:16,329
You guarantee my safety

1256
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:17,962
And for your information,
Nastusya's being attacked.

1257
01:18:17,995 --> 01:18:19,362
They're working up
their courage

1258
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:20,562
To kill her,
you understand?

1259
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:23,462
I'm going to handle this.

1260
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:24,895
And right now!

1261
01:18:24,929 --> 01:18:26,295
Uh--

1262
01:18:34,995 --> 01:18:37,595
What hellish acts
are you up to?

1263
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:41,629
Let Nastusya go!

1264
01:18:41,662 --> 01:18:42,762
Just look at my arm!

1265
01:18:42,795 --> 01:18:44,329
You call this sacrilege?

1266
01:18:44,362 --> 01:18:47,495
And Dorosh, my poor brother
who was merely--

1267
01:18:47,529 --> 01:18:49,629
You could break her
with one finger.

1268
01:18:49,662 --> 01:18:50,629
She's a witch!

1269
01:18:50,662 --> 01:18:51,829
Panas, set her free.
Now!

1270
01:18:51,862 --> 01:18:53,695
Not permitted.

1271
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,762
Master Sotnik.

1272
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:56,329
What?!

1273
01:18:56,362 --> 01:18:57,395
Keep back.

1274
01:18:57,429 --> 01:18:59,729
Uh!

1275
01:18:59,762 --> 01:19:00,795
I have my orders.

1276
01:19:00,829 --> 01:19:02,329
Whose orders?

1277
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,729
And I'm not afraid
to carry them out.

1278
01:19:03,762 --> 01:19:05,562
Whose orders?!

1279
01:19:05,595 --> 01:19:07,495
Mine.

1280
01:19:07,529 --> 01:19:09,862
Watch what you say

1281
01:19:09,895 --> 01:19:11,762
And be very careful.

1282
01:19:11,795 --> 01:19:13,862
No one heeds
your words anymore.

1283
01:19:15,429 --> 01:19:16,829
Sinner!

1284
01:19:16,862 --> 01:19:17,862
Hyah!

1285
01:19:17,895 --> 01:19:19,029
Ooogh!

1286
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:27,762
PAISIY:
And there's another

1287
01:19:27,795 --> 01:19:29,429
Of Satan's servants.

1288
01:19:29,462 --> 01:19:32,562
Grab the sinner!

1289
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:34,962
(People shouting)

1290
01:19:45,795 --> 01:19:46,929
WOMAN:
Get the heathen!

1291
01:19:55,695 --> 01:19:56,695
PAISIY:
Stop!

1292
01:19:56,729 --> 01:19:58,295
We are not savages.

1293
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:01,829
In the pit with the witch.

1294
01:20:01,862 --> 01:20:03,462
I'm a British citizen!

1295
01:20:07,029 --> 01:20:09,662
Let's see how you react to fire,

1296
01:20:09,695 --> 01:20:11,962
British citizen.

1297
01:20:11,995 --> 01:20:14,562
Well witch,
now you have company.

1298
01:20:35,895 --> 01:20:38,729
Let's see what
the bastard's written.

1299
01:20:38,762 --> 01:20:40,329
JONATHAN:
 My dearest Miss Dadli.

1300
01:20:40,362 --> 01:20:42,695
Now.

1301
01:20:44,062 --> 01:20:46,762
"The wings of the
local inhabitants

1302
01:20:46,795 --> 01:20:50,329
Are very similar to those
of several species of bat.

1303
01:20:53,095 --> 01:20:57,029
Who knew that they stretched
to a width of some ten feet?"

1304
01:20:57,062 --> 01:20:58,595
What?

1305
01:20:58,629 --> 01:21:01,762
I felt their rancid breath
 so close

1306
01:21:01,795 --> 01:21:05,362
That I could reach out
 and feel their filthy skin.

1307
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:09,462
"--and can talk
like a human being"?

1308
01:21:10,695 --> 01:21:12,929
Hah!

1309
01:21:12,962 --> 01:21:15,462
"They have hooves.

1310
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:16,962
Do you remember
the sailor with the limp

1311
01:21:16,995 --> 01:21:20,729
That we met
in the Port of London

1312
01:21:20,762 --> 01:21:23,462
And who told us
of an enormous squid?"

1313
01:21:24,595 --> 01:21:25,729
(Crying softly)

1314
01:21:30,695 --> 01:21:31,862
Why are you blubbing?

1315
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:37,395
It's been so long since I last
received a letter from him.

1316
01:21:37,429 --> 01:21:39,629
You're forgetting, my dear,
he's not worth your tears.

1317
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:41,662
Oh Daddy, please.

1318
01:21:43,962 --> 01:21:47,495
"Well here, we have a squid

1319
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:50,062
That is ten times as big,
has six eyes

1320
01:21:50,095 --> 01:21:53,062
And they call it Viy."

1321
01:21:53,095 --> 01:21:55,295
The fellow's obviously
lost his wits.

1322
01:21:55,329 --> 01:22:00,062
"If I should not return,
search for me

1323
01:22:00,095 --> 01:22:01,429
In this accursed place."

1324
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:07,895
Please God,
let it be so, eh?

1325
01:22:09,895 --> 01:22:12,595
(People walking
and talking overhead)

1326
01:22:31,095 --> 01:22:33,962
(Grunting)

1327
01:22:48,929 --> 01:22:50,295
(Whispering)
Hey.

1328
01:22:53,662 --> 01:22:54,695
Come on.

1329
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:56,029
Wake up.

1330
01:22:57,329 --> 01:22:58,562
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1331
01:22:58,595 --> 01:23:00,495
It's all right.
It's all right.

1332
01:23:03,462 --> 01:23:06,395
Um, uh--

1333
01:23:06,429 --> 01:23:07,595
You?

1334
01:23:07,629 --> 01:23:10,662
I'll-- I'll take it off.

1335
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:12,062
It's all right.

1336
01:23:12,095 --> 01:23:13,295
I'll take it off.

1337
01:23:13,329 --> 01:23:14,329
Shh, shh, shh.

1338
01:23:14,362 --> 01:23:16,629
Here you go.

1339
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:23,295
There.

1340
01:23:24,662 --> 01:23:26,562
The monster.

1341
01:23:26,595 --> 01:23:27,862
The monster.

1342
01:23:27,895 --> 01:23:30,762
You're feeding it,
aren't you? Hm?

1343
01:23:33,629 --> 01:23:35,495
For how long?

1344
01:23:35,529 --> 01:23:37,762
A whole year?

1345
01:23:41,362 --> 01:23:42,595
It's just maps.

1346
01:23:44,562 --> 01:23:47,762
Papers than can just
disappear without a trace.

1347
01:23:49,995 --> 01:23:51,795
Wait.

1348
01:23:51,829 --> 01:23:53,829
I didn't make these marks.

1349
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,029
Look.

1350
01:23:55,062 --> 01:23:59,529
So, your monster
can mark routes on maps.

1351
01:23:59,562 --> 01:24:01,829
All of Sotnik's power
should come to me

1352
01:24:01,862 --> 01:24:03,995
Because you know my heart
is burning of it.

1353
01:24:06,495 --> 01:24:07,795
(Paisiy's voice overhead)
Oh, I see. You want his money.

1354
01:24:07,829 --> 01:24:09,062
Shh.

1355
01:24:09,095 --> 01:24:10,662
It's power I need.

1356
01:24:10,695 --> 01:24:11,762
As for the money--

1357
01:24:11,795 --> 01:24:13,662
It's for the church.

1358
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:18,562
OVERKO:
We have to finish off the girl
as soon as possible.

1359
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,729
She saw the whole thing.

1360
01:24:20,762 --> 01:24:23,562
Listen to me.

1361
01:24:23,595 --> 01:24:26,495
I want to conduct the execution
by the swamp.

1362
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:29,062
This way the whole village
will be responsible

1363
01:24:29,095 --> 01:24:31,362
For spilling her blood.

1364
01:24:31,395 --> 01:24:33,829
OVERKO:
Good thinking.

1365
01:24:33,862 --> 01:24:36,462
PAISIY:
And she will be the bait

1366
01:24:36,495 --> 01:24:37,862
To expose a certain kind

1367
01:24:37,895 --> 01:24:40,929
Of monster.

1368
01:24:40,962 --> 01:24:42,329
I'd like to know who

1369
01:24:42,362 --> 01:24:44,929
Is under that skin.

1370
01:24:44,962 --> 01:24:46,962
Now go.

1371
01:24:50,862 --> 01:24:52,529
(Door opening)

1372
01:24:55,562 --> 01:24:57,495
(Chuckling)

1373
01:24:57,529 --> 01:25:00,362
All right, witch.

1374
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,029
(Grunting)

1375
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:03,629
Panas!

1376
01:25:03,662 --> 01:25:05,462
Overko and Paisiy,

1377
01:25:05,495 --> 01:25:06,495
There's a plot
to take over the--

1378
01:25:06,529 --> 01:25:08,062
Ungh!

1379
01:25:08,095 --> 01:25:09,795
You're coming with me!

1380
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:37,595
Huaaah!

1381
01:25:37,629 --> 01:25:38,762
Ungh!

1382
01:25:44,962 --> 01:25:46,429
Run, Nastusya.

1383
01:25:46,462 --> 01:25:47,429
Run!

1384
01:25:47,462 --> 01:25:49,329
(Grunting)

1385
01:25:51,495 --> 01:25:53,662
Why are you dressing up,
stupid cow?

1386
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,429
To see a young girl
put to death?

1387
01:25:56,462 --> 01:25:58,395
Come on, let's go.

1388
01:25:58,429 --> 01:25:59,929
Whoa there.

1389
01:25:59,962 --> 01:26:01,329
Sit down.

1390
01:26:01,362 --> 01:26:02,895
Such a bully.

1391
01:26:04,362 --> 01:26:05,329
You witch.

1392
01:26:05,362 --> 01:26:07,695
(People shouting)

1393
01:26:11,795 --> 01:26:13,029
Drown the witch,
drown her!

1394
01:26:13,062 --> 01:26:15,495
Drown the witch!

1395
01:26:22,995 --> 01:26:36,062
*

1396
01:26:36,095 --> 01:26:37,462
There.

1397
01:26:37,495 --> 01:26:38,962
Good.

1398
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,395
Yavtuhk.

1399
01:26:42,429 --> 01:26:43,495
Why are you here?

1400
01:26:43,529 --> 01:26:44,929
I dare not speak of it.

1401
01:26:44,962 --> 01:26:46,762
Tell me, what's wrong?

1402
01:26:46,795 --> 01:26:50,562
Paisiy's sprinkled the witch
with holy water,

1403
01:26:50,595 --> 01:26:53,795
And she suddenly became crazy
like an animal with sharp claws.

1404
01:26:53,829 --> 01:26:56,529
Then she turned into a crow
and tried to fly!

1405
01:26:56,562 --> 01:26:57,795
You're lying, huh?

1406
01:26:57,829 --> 01:26:59,329
That's a good story.

1407
01:26:59,362 --> 01:27:01,562
I'm not that clever.

1408
01:27:01,595 --> 01:27:02,562
But it's not true, right?

1409
01:27:02,595 --> 01:27:04,395
(Screaming in distance)
See?

1410
01:27:04,429 --> 01:27:06,529
There. Listen.

1411
01:27:06,562 --> 01:27:08,462
Can you hear that?

1412
01:27:08,495 --> 01:27:10,829
They say that when a witch
sinks into the water,

1413
01:27:10,862 --> 01:27:13,795
Well that's just the beginning.

1414
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:15,729
So why are you here?

1415
01:27:15,762 --> 01:27:18,629
Would you mind watching the
scientist while I go look?

1416
01:27:18,662 --> 01:27:20,529
Please, thank you.

1417
01:27:20,562 --> 01:27:21,895
All right, I've got him.

1418
01:27:21,929 --> 01:27:23,829
But I'm a busy man.
Understand that.

1419
01:27:23,862 --> 01:27:27,329
I'll be quick!

1420
01:27:32,795 --> 01:27:34,829
Don't just lay there.
Climb out.

1421
01:27:40,795 --> 01:27:41,862
(Stuttering)

1422
01:27:41,895 --> 01:27:42,929
Petru--
Don't!

1423
01:27:42,962 --> 01:27:44,329
He's joined the others.

1424
01:27:44,362 --> 01:27:45,529
You should run.

1425
01:27:45,562 --> 01:27:48,429
That fire's for you!

1426
01:27:48,462 --> 01:27:49,762
Go along the swamp.

1427
01:27:49,795 --> 01:27:53,495
I've got your things
from the boat.

1428
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:54,762
You'll get wet,

1429
01:27:54,795 --> 01:27:58,062
But it's better
than being burned alive.

1430
01:27:58,095 --> 01:27:59,295
Paisiy.

1431
01:27:59,329 --> 01:28:00,595
Paisiy and Overko.

1432
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:01,762
If we don't stop them,

1433
01:28:01,795 --> 01:28:02,962
A lot of villagers will die.

1434
01:28:02,995 --> 01:28:04,362
They're fanatics.

1435
01:28:04,395 --> 01:28:05,495
I understand.

1436
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:06,495
Be careful, Yavtukh!

1437
01:28:06,529 --> 01:28:07,662
May God be with you.

1438
01:28:07,695 --> 01:28:10,629
PAISIY:
This woman may be a witch.

1439
01:28:10,662 --> 01:28:13,395
Let rightful punishment pass

1440
01:28:13,429 --> 01:28:16,595
Without stones
cast from our hands.

1441
01:28:16,629 --> 01:28:18,329
It's very simple.

1442
01:28:18,362 --> 01:28:19,462
If she floats,
she is a witch.

1443
01:28:19,495 --> 01:28:21,562
There is no other way.

1444
01:28:25,762 --> 01:28:35,462
*

1445
01:28:35,495 --> 01:28:37,462
(Chopping)

1446
01:28:43,829 --> 01:28:45,795
Brothers and sisters,

1447
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:49,262
I call on you to cut this
disease out of our hearts.

1448
01:28:50,362 --> 01:28:51,862
Everything is ready.

1449
01:28:51,895 --> 01:28:52,962
I'm nearly finished.

1450
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:56,329
Petrus! Petrus!

1451
01:28:56,362 --> 01:28:57,562
Go away!

1452
01:28:57,595 --> 01:28:59,795
Let me die.

1453
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:01,029
Ungh!

1454
01:29:01,062 --> 01:29:02,329
No!

1455
01:29:02,362 --> 01:29:03,429
(Grunting)

1456
01:29:03,462 --> 01:29:04,429
I killed her.

1457
01:29:04,462 --> 01:29:05,629
I killed my darling!

1458
01:29:05,662 --> 01:29:07,595
I killed her!

1459
01:29:07,629 --> 01:29:09,295
It'd be best
if I just disappear.

1460
01:29:09,329 --> 01:29:11,429
Petrus, what are you
talking about, "disappear"?

1461
01:29:11,462 --> 01:29:12,929
Khoma Brut disappeared,
you're disappeared.

1462
01:29:12,962 --> 01:29:14,329
I don't understand!

1463
01:29:14,362 --> 01:29:15,562
Gone in a second,

1464
01:29:15,595 --> 01:29:16,562
Without even a trace!

1465
01:29:16,595 --> 01:29:18,029
No, no, no.

1466
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:19,329
Where's the body?

1467
01:29:19,362 --> 01:29:20,695
Where's the grave, huh?

1468
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:22,329
There isn't.

1469
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:23,629
There isn't.
It doesn't exist!

1470
01:29:23,662 --> 01:29:25,795
Listen to me, stop.
Listen to me, Petrus.

1471
01:29:25,829 --> 01:29:27,795
We've got one chance
to save this girl.

1472
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:29,495
One chance,
you understand me?

1473
01:29:29,529 --> 01:29:31,329
I know what you saw
in the swamp.

1474
01:29:31,362 --> 01:29:32,762
What?

1475
01:29:32,795 --> 01:29:34,962
You saw a sheep's head
with horns, no more.

1476
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,562
No monster.

1477
01:29:36,595 --> 01:29:38,662
You-- you simple peasants,

1478
01:29:38,695 --> 01:29:40,062
You create these monsters

1479
01:29:40,095 --> 01:29:42,729
And then you scare yourselves
half to death!

1480
01:29:42,762 --> 01:29:44,495
Of course. It can only be--

1481
01:29:44,529 --> 01:29:46,295
Put on the sheep's skin.
Show yourself.

1482
01:29:46,329 --> 01:29:47,795
They'll chase you!

1483
01:29:49,495 --> 01:29:50,495
Lead everyone to the church.

1484
01:29:50,529 --> 01:29:52,495
Bring them there!

1485
01:30:02,362 --> 01:30:06,529
I never thought I'd witness
such vicious stupidity.

1486
01:30:06,562 --> 01:30:09,795
PAISIY:
I tell you,
we must strengthen our hearts.

1487
01:30:12,062 --> 01:30:14,662
And prepare ourselves all

1488
01:30:14,695 --> 01:30:16,295
To show no mercy.

1489
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:18,729
(Long, mournful horn)

1490
01:30:20,862 --> 01:30:23,695
WOMAN:
That's Viy!

1491
01:30:23,729 --> 01:30:24,695
(Gunshot)

1492
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:25,962
(Squawking)

1493
01:30:25,995 --> 01:30:26,962
Oh!

1494
01:30:26,995 --> 01:30:28,295
I shout Viy!

1495
01:30:28,329 --> 01:30:29,329
Doesn't look
like Viy.

1496
01:30:29,362 --> 01:30:31,429
I shot Viy! I shot Viy!

1497
01:30:31,462 --> 01:30:32,729
(People shouting)

1498
01:30:32,762 --> 01:30:34,662
Stop!

1499
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:36,695
No, stop!

1500
01:30:36,729 --> 01:30:38,062
First we must kill the witch!

1501
01:30:38,095 --> 01:30:40,029
Stop!

1502
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:43,729
Bring him to me.

1503
01:30:45,729 --> 01:30:46,862
(People shouting)

1504
01:30:46,895 --> 01:30:49,429
WOMAN:
Don't let him get away!

1505
01:31:02,895 --> 01:31:04,829
(Loon calling)

1506
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,362
WOMAN:
That's Viy!

1507
01:31:09,395 --> 01:31:17,695
*

1508
01:31:17,729 --> 01:31:19,795
(Squawking)

1509
01:31:26,795 --> 01:31:28,962
(Grunting)

1510
01:31:56,662 --> 01:32:10,695
*

1511
01:32:16,962 --> 01:32:26,662
*

1512
01:32:26,695 --> 01:32:30,462
(Whimpering)

1513
01:32:46,962 --> 01:32:50,795
Looking for these? Huh?

1514
01:32:51,995 --> 01:32:53,329
Oogh!

1515
01:32:55,795 --> 01:32:58,429
Aagh!

1516
01:32:58,462 --> 01:33:00,562
Khoma Brutus.

1517
01:33:04,929 --> 01:33:06,729
You tried to kill me,
didn't you?

1518
01:33:06,762 --> 01:33:07,929
Up there on the dome.

1519
01:33:07,962 --> 01:33:09,762
Didn't you?!

1520
01:33:09,795 --> 01:33:11,462
Steal my work,

1521
01:33:11,495 --> 01:33:12,895
And escape any punishment.

1522
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:14,462
You want facts.

1523
01:33:14,495 --> 01:33:16,429
I'll give you facts.

1524
01:33:16,462 --> 01:33:17,729
(Grunting)

1525
01:33:17,762 --> 01:33:19,529
You liked Sotnik's daughter.

1526
01:33:19,562 --> 01:33:21,295
You liked her a lot,

1527
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:23,429
But when you realized
she was out of your league,

1528
01:33:23,462 --> 01:33:24,662
You attacked the poor girl,

1529
01:33:24,695 --> 01:33:27,029
Raped her,
and left her for dead.

1530
01:33:27,062 --> 01:33:28,529
(Gunshot)

1531
01:33:28,562 --> 01:33:31,529
As she lay there dying,

1532
01:33:31,562 --> 01:33:33,629
She hoped that her attacker,
being forced to pray

1533
01:33:33,662 --> 01:33:35,995
Over her dead body for
three days and three nights,

1534
01:33:36,029 --> 01:33:38,629
Would repent and confess.

1535
01:33:40,429 --> 01:33:42,929
But not you.

1536
01:33:42,962 --> 01:33:45,395
"He knows who wears
the sheep's."

1537
01:33:45,429 --> 01:33:48,029
Those were the last
words she said.

1538
01:33:48,062 --> 01:33:49,995
"Sheep's skin"
is what she meant to say.

1539
01:33:50,029 --> 01:33:53,295
And you.

1540
01:33:53,329 --> 01:33:55,429
You terrorized the village
for a whole year

1541
01:33:55,462 --> 01:33:57,362
And right now, as we speak

1542
01:33:57,395 --> 01:33:58,729
Another innocent girl
will be murdered

1543
01:33:58,762 --> 01:34:00,729
Because of you!

1544
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:06,029
Well I won't let it happen.

1545
01:34:06,062 --> 01:34:08,529
Your secret will be revealed
once and for all.

1546
01:34:08,562 --> 01:34:09,795
What do you want from me?

1547
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:11,862
Get up!

1548
01:34:13,095 --> 01:34:14,629
You won't believe me.

1549
01:34:17,062 --> 01:34:19,462
Ah, tired.

1550
01:34:19,495 --> 01:34:20,629
JONATHAN:
Where'd you get that?

1551
01:34:20,662 --> 01:34:22,895
Where did you get that belt?

1552
01:34:22,929 --> 01:34:24,662
(Grunting)

1553
01:34:24,695 --> 01:34:27,029
You won't believe me.

1554
01:34:27,062 --> 01:34:28,529
Where did you get it?!

1555
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:30,929
I got it when it snapped
off your map case,

1556
01:34:30,962 --> 01:34:33,429
As I hauled you
out of the swamp.

1557
01:34:33,462 --> 01:34:34,995
Lies.

1558
01:34:35,029 --> 01:34:37,529
KHOMA:
I told you
you wouldn't believe me.

1559
01:34:37,562 --> 01:34:39,729
So what about this?

1560
01:34:39,762 --> 01:34:40,962
Why did you steal my maps?

1561
01:34:40,995 --> 01:34:43,295
It was my only chance
of survival.

1562
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:48,395
(Wood breaking)

1563
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:50,462
(Creaking)

1564
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:54,429
Agh!

1565
01:34:54,462 --> 01:34:55,595
Aahh!

1566
01:34:55,629 --> 01:34:59,529
With your map I
could get away.

1567
01:34:59,562 --> 01:35:00,895
Where else would I go?

1568
01:35:00,929 --> 01:35:03,929
To the seminary,
so everyone could ridicule me?

1569
01:35:03,962 --> 01:35:05,029
Accuse me of crimes
I didn't commit,

1570
01:35:05,062 --> 01:35:06,629
Like killing Pannochka?

1571
01:35:06,662 --> 01:35:07,995
Look! It's the Devil!

1572
01:35:08,029 --> 01:35:09,862
Boys, it's me, Khoma.

1573
01:35:09,895 --> 01:35:12,662
Don't run away!

1574
01:35:12,695 --> 01:35:13,962
So, it was you who set
Overko and Dorosh

1575
01:35:13,995 --> 01:35:17,295
At each other's throats.

1576
01:35:17,329 --> 01:35:18,829
They were too greedy.

1577
01:35:18,862 --> 01:35:20,795
Wait.
Help me understand.

1578
01:35:20,829 --> 01:35:23,062
Why did Pannochka want you
to pray over her body?

1579
01:35:23,095 --> 01:35:24,462
Why?

1580
01:35:27,529 --> 01:35:29,962
A year ago,
me, Gorobets and Khalyava

1581
01:35:29,995 --> 01:35:33,962
Completely lost our way,

1582
01:35:33,995 --> 01:35:36,829
And found ourselves staying
at the water mill by the swamp.

1583
01:35:39,795 --> 01:35:41,862
That is my wreath you found.

1584
01:35:41,895 --> 01:35:43,495
What's your name?

1585
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:45,295
I'm Khoma.

1586
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:46,895
Philosophy.

1587
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:50,362
No uh--
I'm a student of philosophy

1588
01:35:50,395 --> 01:35:51,962
From the seminary.

1589
01:35:51,995 --> 01:35:55,795
You may be a Christian student
from the seminary...

1590
01:35:59,395 --> 01:36:00,762
...but we too have our powerful
ancient traditions.

1591
01:36:00,795 --> 01:36:01,962
(Chuckling)

1592
01:36:01,995 --> 01:36:05,429
I have decided...

1593
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:11,362
I will take you my destiny.

1594
01:36:11,395 --> 01:36:14,695
And you're supposed
to love me truly forever.

1595
01:36:21,395 --> 01:36:22,629
Pannochka!

1596
01:36:25,595 --> 01:36:32,895
*

1597
01:36:32,929 --> 01:36:34,062
Pannochka!

1598
01:36:34,095 --> 01:36:36,529
(Screaming)

1599
01:36:40,662 --> 01:36:43,562
In fear I put
on the sheep's skin.

1600
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:45,762
I was sure Nastusya
would think

1601
01:36:45,795 --> 01:36:48,662
I was the one
who attacked Pannochka.

1602
01:36:48,695 --> 01:36:51,362
(Long, mournful foghorn drone)

1603
01:36:52,462 --> 01:36:53,695
In gratitude for saving her,

1604
01:36:53,729 --> 01:36:57,762
She fed that monster
for over a year,

1605
01:36:57,795 --> 01:37:00,729
And I've been praying for
Pannochka's soul ever since.

1606
01:37:00,762 --> 01:37:02,695
Only the first three nights
were terrible.

1607
01:37:02,729 --> 01:37:06,995
When the third night was over,
I was paralyzed from fear,

1608
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:10,529
From what I had endured
in the church.

1609
01:37:10,562 --> 01:37:12,462
It was then at daybreak

1610
01:37:12,495 --> 01:37:14,329
That he came.

1611
01:37:14,362 --> 01:37:15,762
I've heard enough
about Viy.

1612
01:37:15,795 --> 01:37:18,495
No. He's more terrifying.

1613
01:37:18,529 --> 01:37:19,695
Who?

1614
01:37:19,729 --> 01:37:20,795
Who was it?

1615
01:37:20,829 --> 01:37:22,695
It's him!

1616
01:37:22,729 --> 01:37:24,829
(Grunting)

1617
01:37:30,495 --> 01:37:32,295
Just lure the villagers away,

1618
01:37:32,329 --> 01:37:34,029
And she'll be fine.

1619
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:37,729
I'm coming, Nastusya.

1620
01:37:37,762 --> 01:37:39,395
(Dog barking)

1621
01:37:39,429 --> 01:37:40,595
(Gun cocking)

1622
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:42,829
Well, monster.

1623
01:37:42,862 --> 01:37:44,729
Look who's playing games.

1624
01:37:44,762 --> 01:37:46,895
(Birds squawking)

1625
01:37:46,929 --> 01:37:48,995
Well, Khoma.

1626
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:52,462
You never saw it coming,
did you?

1627
01:37:52,495 --> 01:37:53,962
You like it there
with that dead flesh?

1628
01:37:53,995 --> 01:37:55,862
If you'd have died,

1629
01:37:55,895 --> 01:37:57,962
All of this would have been
much simpler!

1630
01:37:57,995 --> 01:37:59,795
(Wood creaking)

1631
01:37:59,829 --> 01:38:00,795
(Panting)

1632
01:38:00,829 --> 01:38:02,295
I don't know how,

1633
01:38:02,329 --> 01:38:03,695
But you survived.

1634
01:38:05,895 --> 01:38:09,529
I only meant to scare her
with the disguise.

1635
01:38:09,562 --> 01:38:12,529
Oh, how she tempted me.

1636
01:38:12,562 --> 01:38:13,562
That's why I put on the skin.

1637
01:38:13,595 --> 01:38:15,962
She seduced me, too.

1638
01:38:15,995 --> 01:38:18,462
How she moaned,

1639
01:38:18,495 --> 01:38:20,329
And how the fire raged

1640
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:22,295
In her black, devilish eyes.

1641
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:25,629
It wasn't I who sinned.

1642
01:38:25,662 --> 01:38:27,429
She was the temptress!

1643
01:38:27,462 --> 01:38:28,995
It's the tempter who sins,

1644
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:31,929
Not the one who is tempted!

1645
01:38:31,962 --> 01:38:33,029
(Whispering)
Somebody help me.

1646
01:38:33,062 --> 01:38:34,529
Huuagh!

1647
01:38:34,562 --> 01:38:36,895
(Creaking)

1648
01:38:36,929 --> 01:38:51,829
*

1649
01:38:51,862 --> 01:38:53,729
(Wood creaking)

1650
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:55,595
Don't bother shouting out.

1651
01:38:55,629 --> 01:38:59,995
No one will hear you.

1652
01:39:00,029 --> 01:39:02,862
And if they do,

1653
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:06,329
They're too superstitious
to come up here.

1654
01:39:06,362 --> 01:39:07,862
Where have you hidden
my gold coins?

1655
01:39:07,895 --> 01:39:09,062
Nastusya needs me.

1656
01:39:09,095 --> 01:39:12,429
YAVTUKH:
Let him go.

1657
01:39:12,462 --> 01:39:14,829
Or your head will say goodbye
to your shoulders.

1658
01:39:15,995 --> 01:39:17,395
Petrus, run.

1659
01:39:17,429 --> 01:39:19,562
Save her now!

1660
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:25,429
You want a miracle?

1661
01:39:25,462 --> 01:39:26,729
No problem.

1662
01:39:26,762 --> 01:39:28,962
I make miracles all the time.

1663
01:39:28,995 --> 01:39:31,629
For many years
I travelled Europe,

1664
01:39:31,662 --> 01:39:34,562
And I learned what was needed
to start a new religion.

1665
01:39:34,595 --> 01:39:37,395
Then scientists like you

1666
01:39:37,429 --> 01:39:40,395
Created tools to help
men like me take charge.

1667
01:39:41,662 --> 01:39:44,729
I am the new Messiah!

1668
01:39:48,629 --> 01:39:50,662
Now die.

1669
01:39:50,695 --> 01:39:52,762
What?

1670
01:39:52,795 --> 01:39:54,462
As a priest,

1671
01:39:54,495 --> 01:39:57,929
I should give you
a chance to repent.

1672
01:39:57,962 --> 01:40:00,729
Read a prayer for the dying.

1673
01:40:04,629 --> 01:40:09,429
"Our Father, who art in Heaven."

1674
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:11,462
"Our Father,
who art in Heaven,

1675
01:40:11,495 --> 01:40:12,762
Hallowed be thy name."

1676
01:40:15,762 --> 01:40:17,962
PETRUS:
Nastusya!

1677
01:40:17,995 --> 01:40:21,762
(Gasping)

1678
01:40:21,795 --> 01:40:24,829
(Angelic singing)

1679
01:40:24,862 --> 01:40:26,729
Nastusya!

1680
01:40:26,762 --> 01:40:28,995
(Splashing)

1681
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:30,995
(Singing continues)

1682
01:40:35,695 --> 01:40:37,829
Nastusya!

1683
01:40:39,662 --> 01:40:42,929
I want you to understand,
Scientist,

1684
01:40:42,962 --> 01:40:45,829
That your life isn't
in the hands

1685
01:40:45,862 --> 01:40:47,362
Of our Lord above, no.

1686
01:40:47,395 --> 01:40:48,762
Your life is in my hands.

1687
01:40:48,795 --> 01:40:53,495
I am the one who decides
who lives

1688
01:40:53,529 --> 01:40:55,429
And who dies!

1689
01:40:55,462 --> 01:40:56,462
A curse upon you!

1690
01:40:56,495 --> 01:40:58,995
(Bell tolling)

1691
01:41:04,329 --> 01:41:06,529
You go back
to your business, please.

1692
01:41:08,762 --> 01:41:11,329
Well, young Daniel.

1693
01:41:11,362 --> 01:41:14,529
I have a confession.

1694
01:41:14,562 --> 01:41:16,662
I'm ashamed to say,

1695
01:41:16,695 --> 01:41:18,595
That I severely misjudged
your father.

1696
01:41:20,729 --> 01:41:22,429
Mmm.

1697
01:41:22,462 --> 01:41:23,862
Believe me,

1698
01:41:23,895 --> 01:41:26,862
And you will be proud of him.

1699
01:41:26,895 --> 01:41:30,429
These are his letters
to your mother.

1700
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:34,895
Hm?

1701
01:41:34,929 --> 01:41:37,895
Which I intend to publish

1702
01:41:37,929 --> 01:41:42,462
So that the world will see
how wrong it is

1703
01:41:42,495 --> 01:41:44,962
To judge a man as rashly
as I did.

1704
01:41:48,929 --> 01:41:52,029
They burned poor Bruno
at the stake,

1705
01:41:52,062 --> 01:41:55,362
When he said
the world was round.

1706
01:41:55,395 --> 01:41:56,595
(Baby cooing)

1707
01:41:56,629 --> 01:41:58,795
Hm?

1708
01:42:02,395 --> 01:42:04,395
Now,

1709
01:42:04,429 --> 01:42:06,795
You hang on to these.

1710
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:07,795
Mm-hm.

1711
01:42:07,829 --> 01:42:09,462
(Fluttering)

1712
01:42:09,495 --> 01:42:10,462
(Gasping)

1713
01:42:10,495 --> 01:42:11,729
Jonathan.

1714
01:42:11,762 --> 01:42:13,862
There's another pigeon.

1715
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:18,629
Now, we're going to see
how the story ends.

1716
01:42:18,662 --> 01:42:20,795
(Birds squawking)

1717
01:42:20,829 --> 01:42:22,729
Where are you going?
Up there!

1718
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,329
Aren't you afraid?

1719
01:42:24,362 --> 01:42:25,929
A real Cossack
doesn't fear anything.

1720
01:42:32,695 --> 01:42:34,995
Let's get this guy.

1721
01:42:35,029 --> 01:42:37,862
PAISIY:
I'm the one who decides

1722
01:42:37,895 --> 01:42:39,462
Who lives and who dies.

1723
01:42:39,495 --> 01:42:42,429
You might as well
be shouting "fire!"

1724
01:42:42,462 --> 01:42:44,495
From the watchtower.

1725
01:42:44,529 --> 01:42:45,962
The whole neighbourhood
can hear you.

1726
01:42:45,995 --> 01:42:49,529
(Battering door)

1727
01:42:51,795 --> 01:42:53,062
A curse upon you!

1728
01:42:53,095 --> 01:42:54,495
(Wood moaning)

1729
01:42:54,529 --> 01:42:56,429
Aaahh!

1730
01:43:01,595 --> 01:43:04,762
(Wood creaking)

1731
01:43:04,795 --> 01:43:19,595
*

1732
01:43:20,729 --> 01:43:24,462
(Gasping for breath)

1733
01:43:28,929 --> 01:43:31,262
Papa!

1734
01:43:35,595 --> 01:43:37,895
(Staggered breathing)

1735
01:43:45,062 --> 01:43:47,029
LORD DADLI READING:
 "A miracle has happened.

1736
01:43:47,062 --> 01:43:49,629
(Door opening)

1737
01:43:51,929 --> 01:43:55,329
I feel the breath of God.

1738
01:43:57,762 --> 01:43:59,829
His touch,
which has changed my fate.

1739
01:43:59,862 --> 01:44:02,962
Never before have I felt
anything like this.

1740
01:44:02,995 --> 01:44:05,895
All my life passed
before my eyes,

1741
01:44:05,929 --> 01:44:09,862
And I thought,

1742
01:44:09,895 --> 01:44:13,795
What will I leave
after I depart this world?

1743
01:44:13,829 --> 01:44:15,962
My dear, I want us
to have a child."

1744
01:44:15,995 --> 01:44:18,895
(Chuckling)

1745
01:44:18,929 --> 01:44:20,962
There you are.

1746
01:44:20,995 --> 01:44:23,462
Your master and I
were such good friends.

1747
01:44:23,495 --> 01:44:24,462
(Whinnying)

1748
01:44:24,495 --> 01:44:25,629
Quiet!

1749
01:44:25,662 --> 01:44:27,562
(Whinnying)

1750
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:28,562
Ogh!

1751
01:44:28,595 --> 01:44:31,329
"Evil was punished.

1752
01:44:31,362 --> 01:44:32,929
I received a worthy payment."

1753
01:44:32,962 --> 01:44:33,962
Look!
There's Sotnik's money!

1754
01:44:33,995 --> 01:44:35,462
Ha-ha-ha!

1755
01:44:35,495 --> 01:44:37,829
Well is it enough
for you now, Overko?

1756
01:44:37,862 --> 01:44:40,829
It's my money! Mine!

1757
01:44:46,995 --> 01:44:49,029
Petrus, help me pack.

1758
01:44:52,895 --> 01:44:56,529
*

1759
01:44:56,562 --> 01:44:59,862
LORD DADLI:
 "The body and soul of Pannochka
 are now both at peace,

1760
01:44:59,895 --> 01:45:03,895
And her father's spirit
 is at ease.

1761
01:45:03,929 --> 01:45:05,895
And Khoma,

1762
01:45:05,929 --> 01:45:08,695
I am probably similar
 to this seminary student

1763
01:45:08,729 --> 01:45:10,062
With our scientific
 scepticism."

1764
01:45:10,095 --> 01:45:12,529
What is it?
Come on, move.

1765
01:45:12,562 --> 01:45:15,595
"Fortune chose me especially
 for this godforsaken place.

1766
01:45:15,629 --> 01:45:17,929
To finish the story that
 started with him."

1767
01:45:17,962 --> 01:45:21,362
Out of my way.

1768
01:45:21,395 --> 01:45:22,662
Told you.

1769
01:45:22,695 --> 01:45:25,362
It's definitely magic.

1770
01:45:25,395 --> 01:45:26,629
GIRL:
Science and magic?

1771
01:45:26,662 --> 01:45:29,062
Move.

1772
01:45:29,095 --> 01:45:31,795
Let me through!

1773
01:45:31,829 --> 01:45:34,362
What is that?

1774
01:45:34,395 --> 01:45:35,995
(Children murmuring)

1775
01:45:36,029 --> 01:45:38,029
GIRL:
I wanna see!

1776
01:45:38,062 --> 01:45:40,295
JONATHAN:
Where's the steam, Taras?

1777
01:45:40,329 --> 01:45:41,495
That's it.

1778
01:45:41,529 --> 01:45:43,362
BOY:
Oh, oh!

1779
01:45:52,029 --> 01:45:54,895
It's amazing that
the geniuses of mankind

1780
01:45:54,929 --> 01:45:56,429
Can either destroy or create,

1781
01:45:56,462 --> 01:45:58,629
Depending on who they follow.

1782
01:45:58,662 --> 01:46:00,429
We'll have moving images

1783
01:46:00,462 --> 01:46:01,929
That'll bring far away cities
and people to us all.

1784
01:46:03,395 --> 01:46:04,595
GIRL:
It's magic!

1785
01:46:06,429 --> 01:46:07,862
It's moving!

1786
01:46:07,895 --> 01:46:09,862
JONATHAN:
 Now that my fear is vanquished

1787
01:46:09,895 --> 01:46:11,362
And my cold, scientific mind

1788
01:46:11,395 --> 01:46:13,329
Can again analyze my feelings,

1789
01:46:13,362 --> 01:46:16,662
I can confirm that
 all of the fantastic events

1790
01:46:16,695 --> 01:46:19,362
Of the last days
 are nothing more than a figment

1791
01:46:19,395 --> 01:46:21,962
Of people's collective
 imagination-

1792
01:46:21,995 --> 01:46:26,762
Something which is still little
 studied by modern science.

1793
01:46:32,029 --> 01:46:34,029
(Shrieking)

1794
01:46:43,862 --> 01:46:58,795
*

1795
01:47:06,529 --> 01:47:08,929
Look deeply in my eyes

1796
01:47:08,962 --> 01:47:11,895
As you burn for eternity.

1797
01:47:20,662 --> 01:47:35,595
*

1798
01:47:46,695 --> 01:48:01,629

1799
01:48:15,629 --> 01:48:30,562
*

1800
01:48:45,829 --> 01:49:00,762
*

1801
01:49:16,595 --> 01:49:31,529
*

1802
01:49:47,395 --> 01:50:02,329

1803
