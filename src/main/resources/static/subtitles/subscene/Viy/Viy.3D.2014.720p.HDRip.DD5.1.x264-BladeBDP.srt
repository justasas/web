00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:26,915
This is the first day of April.

191
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:32,957
Probably occurs in spring Greenwich

192
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,991
Imagine your window

193
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,281
before you extend a flourishing garden

194
00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:43,856
Spring sun caress your hair.

195
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,858
Thank you, nurse.

196
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:50,993
How can he do that.

197
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,298
What a witch...

198
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:56,889
Galabova mail, right?

199
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:59,198
Daddy, look at me

200
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,363
My God...

201
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:10,912
I'll kill him!

202
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,320
It's been exactly one year

203
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:25,030
Since the beginning of my journey.

204
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:29,189
Luck, who accompanied me left me.

205
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:32,982
I guess I strayed from the path.

206
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,700
I have not eaten for several days

207
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:40,443
Finished  funds to be able to continue the journey
.

208
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,939
Do not shoot...

209
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,229
What are you?

210
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,231
Bursaki...

211
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,234
foods, do you?

212
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:33,626
Are you hungry?

213
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:34,949
I'm hungry.

214
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,774
So you were saying...

215
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:38,776
Feast upon ...

216
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:40,686
hiding?

217
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:41,642
Who Am I?

218
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:43,644
Yes from me!...

219
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,449
Stay!

220
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,451
What... what?

221
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,699
This is not eating, it's breakfast...

222
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,199
Here...

223
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,201
dating.

224
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,694
So the gentleman is a scholar.

225
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,359
Yes, yes... a scientist.

226
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,989
We're scientists.

227
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,609
I, for one, am orator Gorobetz...

228
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,314
and this is Halyava theologian.

229
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:11,811
Where is the city?

230
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,699
There are near here

231
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,069
Hutar.

232
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,070
Hutar

233
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,188
But I do not even enemy I

234
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:20,273
advised to go there.

235
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,238
Why?

236
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,778
Around that same Hutar

237
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:24,853
killed our friend.

238
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:25,995
Scientist Do?

239
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:27,318
To Scientist...

240
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,320
philosopher Homa Brutus.

241
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,579
A year ago I Homa and Holyava

242
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:36,813
returns to the place of the bursa...

243
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:39,603
Because the dawn mist you...

244
00:21:39,604 --> 00:21:41,393
or the devil we visit her...

245
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,395
gone astray.

246
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:44,921
Where Panas

247
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:46,318
Excuse me Taras

248
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,893
but service is service...

249
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,280
... a sign?

250
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:57,365
... A sign we are not drunk!

251
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,610
... For the soul!

252
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,910
Who's there?

253
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:14,853
Let us  grandmother to lodge.

254
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:16,483
When I was full of people,

255
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:18,485
where to put you.

256
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:29,069
Well,

257
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,449
you go.

258
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:50,607
Look Babka

259
00:22:50,608 --> 00:22:53,232
by God in my stomach like that

260
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:54,027
someone driving a cart.

261
00:22:54,028 --> 00:22:56,404
Lie what you want?

262
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:59,069
I do not .

263
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:15,260
Do you remember your soul decent,

264
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,699
... buy pods...

265
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:29,264
is a slut this Page

266
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:31,856
nose and it is not pretty.

267
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,686
And her hands are not clean.

268
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,865
All grandmothers are witches.

269
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,311
A market are accurate witches.

270
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,985
And  fatigue are asleep...

271
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,580
Hear grandmother...

272
00:24:48,581 --> 00:24:50,582
now fasting...

273
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:52,815
I'm not that guy,

274
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:56,100
that 1000 gold pieces will be vile.

275
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:59,566
Do not Ow outdated, obsolete.

276
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,479
old woman turned out that
young mistress,

277
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,274
because she was a witch.

278
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:54,443
I already know that for sure.

279
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,564
My teacher Isaac Newton

280
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:10,484
discovered the law of gravity

281
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,019
That free flight is absolutely impossible.

282
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,693
Here, free fall...

283
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,351
as you like.

284
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,802
What we lie to you?

285
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:42,775
Fact colleagues.

286
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:52,368
Well, I blew
right here

287
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:55,153
Funny you

288
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:57,629
is that after this time

289
00:26:57,814 --> 00:27:00,388
Homma never saw him again.

290
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,558
Homma allow yourself to Satan
witch etc. iniquities.

291
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,693
So perished

292
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:19,478
that in this world...

293
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,233
Died...

294
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:21,768
Do not lie, he died.

295
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,770
Hey God, died.

296
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,605
Pour

297
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:35,662
A? This is the best.

298
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,055
How is it?

299
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,273
Not bad!

300
00:27:39,274 --> 00:27:43,432
A Hutar started in such a diabolical besotiya,

301
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:45,733
that my seemingly God.

302
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:48,597
He said Homa scared.

303
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:49,902
Lie

304
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,102
And here that do not lie

305
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,974
long I think about them...

306
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,234
Properly say,

307
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:06,807
scared of the witch and killed.

308
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:09,778
We can go back in Hutar, huh?

309
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,984
Where are you going?

310
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:17,097
I know why he died.

311
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:18,482
Because  scared.

312
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:21,887
If it was not, nothing will happen to him.

313
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,889
Wait

314
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:27,993
had only to cross himself,

315
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:30,307
and spit tail

316
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,192
and that's it

317
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:33,597
Then nothing would have.

318
00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:35,599
I already know that.

319
00:28:56,312 --> 00:28:59,381
However  glorious man was Homa.

320
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:02,483
Noble man was.

321
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:06,193
A vanished...

322
00:29:07,942 --> 00:29:10,615
Dirty power... Satan...

323
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,726
God... what do...

324
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:36,771
strange sound

325
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:39,544
thing is that it is strange

326
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:42,976
And you say that this is the monster?

327
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:44,191
And there are nine horns?

328
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:46,016
Seven horns... seven.

329
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,018
Get up, get up.

330
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:51,741
You go ahead,

331
00:29:51,742 --> 00:29:53,920
but we can there.

332
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:02,022
Hey, colleagues

333
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:05,232
funny stories.

334
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:39,692
What are you doing?

335
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:31,053
What was that guys?

336
00:32:31,054 --> 00:32:33,055
Repent.

337
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:54,477
Here's the sign

338
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:58,339
devil Ambassador penetrated the circle.

339
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:02,937
Ambassador What is he,

340
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:05,809
when his feet muddy.

341
00:34:11,978 --> 00:34:14,750
It does not seem Ambassador.

342
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:54,308
Trouble

343
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,848
Ambassador from hell.

344
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:07,808
Jonathan Green

345
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:10,011
Jonathan Green to me.

346
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:11,881
I am Jonathan Green.

347
00:35:11,882 --> 00:35:13,883
Scientist, cartographer,

348
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:16,431
I citizen of her majesty

349
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:18,433
Queen of England.

350
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:25,308
Welcome you

351
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:30,345
Everything swim to our shores

352
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:32,347
still has splinters.

353
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:40,515
I turned my telescope

354
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:42,090
there, where I saw the fire.

355
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,395
And could well make out

356
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:45,655
frenzied movements of the savages.

357
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:47,640
I was confident that these fires

358
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:49,590
they were roasting their terrible lunch

359
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:50,902
from human flesh.

360
00:35:50,903 --> 00:35:52,904
What are you reading?

361
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:56,135
Last bestseller Mr. Dafoe,

362
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:58,435
adventure of Robinson Crusoe.

363
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:03,881
Of all great writers you
a passion right in it?

364
00:36:04,686 --> 00:36:06,760
Reply what is this lady?

365
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,487
Father, please give it to me.

366
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:10,145
This is it, right?

367
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:13,720
I asked you to drop the
all relations with him.

368
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,225
Insist in my home

369
00:36:15,226 --> 00:36:17,800
nothing reminds of that person.

370
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:18,685
Quiet Dad,

371
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:19,925
forget that this person

372
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:21,095
is the father of my child

373
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:24,300
And maybe this minute it
threatens grave danger.

374
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:26,132
Surrounding savages and pirates

375
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,930
on a desert island.

376
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,932
Divaci? Island?...

377
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,184
What island

378
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:34,969
This is the largest continent on earth

379
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,934
And your  null Cartographer Jonathan Green

380
00:36:37,935 --> 00:36:39,936
is at its very center.

381
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,514
Continent?

382
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:43,792

You did not say anything...

429
00:39:16,128 --> 00:39:17,722

433
00:39:23,178 --> 00:39:24,342

00:40:12,262 --> 00:40:15,331
Call this... this... teachings.

442
00:40:18,302 --> 00:40:20,303
But quietly.

443
00:40:41,642 --> 00:40:45,107
Excuse me, do you speak English?

444
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:51,843
What is your name?

00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:13,092
It is not.

449
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:32,512
Your brother Scientists.

00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,254
On far you decided to fly?

451
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:18,256
Scientists pan.

452
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,261
What's the problem?

453
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,509
Pan Sotnik you shout at him.

454
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,511
Only, quietly.

455
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,431
Nastusya... Nastusya

456
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,139
I love you, and you tormenting me

457
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,374
You know I was serious if
not see you for an hour

458
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,444
Year and you already torturing me...

459
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,464
... I saw the manes of horses burning

460
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,049
I suddenly thought...

461
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,505
everything at us... so much fear...
repent.

462
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,470
My bike

463
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:13,140
Spirit, you hear?

464
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:18,555
All  grandmothers witches...

465
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:26,663
In water path is shorter.

466
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,680
Clean as a whistle.

467
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,108
Sotnik Pan...

468
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:45,110
Teachings...

469
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:48,293
Hey Cartography, do you believe in god?

470
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,588
How to tell

471
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:51,590
I'm a scientist

472
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,838
So in the devil you do not.

473
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,258
I do not believe.

474
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,260
I thought.

475
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:01,838
It's going to happen that

476
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,492
church and all my lands
bear.

477
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,547
Map?

478
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:11,320
But to me it takes time.

479
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:15,299
1000 coins.

480
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:21,856
What does pan Sotnik?

481
00:44:22,468 --> 00:44:25,339
For  damn place questioning.

482
00:44:25,888 --> 00:44:27,797
This is an old song.

483
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,669
Says his boys...

484
00:44:31,178 --> 00:44:34,049
once will clear the way...

485
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,007
I want to see those guys,

486
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,832
who will go to the cursed place.

487
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,834
No such heroes...

488
00:45:02,588 --> 00:45:04,589
here advance

489
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:07,396
I need and helper.

490
00:45:07,423 --> 00:45:09,424
'll Have help.

491
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:12,641
Start with the old church,

492
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,753
but anyone anything.

493
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,291
Pan Sotnik must hurry.

494
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:22,293
Give Pan scientist...

495
00:45:24,507 --> 00:45:26,256
Excuse him,

496
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:27,296
What happened?

497
00:45:27,297 --> 00:45:28,636
Ever since his daughter died,

498
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:30,586
is not himself.

499
00:45:30,587 --> 00:45:33,211
People thought that
young lady is a witch...

500
00:45:33,212 --> 00:45:34,663
soul wanders in these marshes

501
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:36,256
And can not calm down,

502
00:45:36,257 --> 00:45:38,461
this resulted in Homa Hutar

503
00:45:38,462 --> 00:45:39,836
and locked in the circle,

504
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,006
should not pass it impure force.

505
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:47,056
From there only the brave Cossacks
can not go.

506
00:45:53,507 --> 00:45:56,081
Come on... go... go!

507
00:46:10,007 --> 00:46:12,008
I need facts.

508
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:18,581
Do not tell anyone about this,

509
00:46:18,582 --> 00:46:21,254
you were at Pan sotnik.

510
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:30,230
If he's right Paisij...

511
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:32,232
Now we will check...

512
00:46:41,336 --> 00:46:43,337
Where is the learning?

513
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,427
Here.

514
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:02,978
Guys... to be... all right.

515
00:47:10,256 --> 00:47:12,257
How a scientist?

516
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:20,500
I know those observed stars.

517
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,580
What kind of science is.

518
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,459
The ones I'm talking about...

519
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,192
watch the stars through the glass.

520
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,834
There was one with us.

521
00:47:41,255 --> 00:47:42,854
Also learned...

522
00:47:42,855 --> 00:47:44,609
philosopher.

523
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,611
Homa Brutus

524
00:47:57,755 --> 00:48:01,418
... You pan scientist, how do you know him?

525
00:48:05,835 --> 00:48:07,704
I've already heard,

526
00:48:07,705 --> 00:48:09,389
all know it.

527
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,146
Whom you do not know

528
00:48:11,147 --> 00:48:13,148
celebrity...

529
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:23,668
Our cry then pan Sotnik in itself,

530
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:28,389
and ordered to take you
Homa Brutus at bursatsite.

531
00:48:48,754 --> 00:48:50,833
Vain you think...

532
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:55,578
not here shantak could quickly escape.

533
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:57,757
Ah, wonderful place...

534
00:48:58,424 --> 00:49:01,493
Here to run, to catch fish.

535
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:04,635
Hunting weapon...

536
00:49:05,924 --> 00:49:09,793
However, I think in these forests
there are many birds...

537
00:49:09,794 --> 00:49:13,368
fruit can dry
and sell in the city,

538
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:17,329
and more well if you boil them vodka.

539
00:49:18,254 --> 00:49:24,392
Because  no beer
can not be compared to fruit vodka.

540
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:29,828
Why pan Sotnik chose
Negi. Oh for such an important job?

541
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:32,502
There was no stand any kind of

542
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:35,869
This is acknowledged

543
00:49:36,035 --> 00:49:38,132
If she takes a notion panels

544
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:42,489
then most
literate person would understand.

545
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:46,036
And we brought in Hama in the church.

546
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:49,332
Let me boys

547
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,303
remember that dogs were barking.

548
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:36,577
Cossack  What I am after is afraid.

549
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:38,756
Smell a little tobacco.

550
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:49,833
Nice tobacco.

551
00:50:56,462 --> 00:50:59,630
This terrible sparkling beauty.

552
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:13,710
Where is this church?

553
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:17,464
What for you this pan scientist?

554
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:24,078
Nothing.

555
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,993
Most needed thing in our Hutar,

556
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:27,748
draw him round

557
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:29,498
and the devil do not be afraid.

558
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,500
And even from a witch.

559
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:39,348
They say that every witch has a small tail.

560
00:54:40,204 --> 00:54:43,168
Where your daughter again to swamp you?

561
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:44,418
I tell you, do not go.

562
00:54:44,419 --> 00:54:47,638
This is actually the tales and prejudices.

563
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:51,328
Maybe to you, in Europe and no witches

564
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:55,190
A country, in Kiev, all grandmothers are.

565
00:54:59,919 --> 00:55:02,537
Seen that the teachings pan is not understood.

566
00:55:02,538 --> 00:55:07,983
Young mistress
get involved with the devil and became a witch.

567
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:11,039
Yavtuh You do not drink?

568
00:55:11,668 --> 00:55:14,836
You can propiesh craftsmanship.

569
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:47,459
Enough...

570
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:52,046
What were you started to chat...

571
00:56:18,577 --> 00:56:20,953
Hey, scientist panel well,

Here they are, my evidence.

576
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:40,481

It already is not scary.

581
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:12,035
Must sanctify the whole church so,

582
00:58:12,036 --> 00:58:15,006
can be seen during the day.

583
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:53,122
It is under the table

584
01:02:56,741 --> 01:02:59,660

585
01:02:59,661 --> 01:03:01,662

Do not let him take the chalk, turn

589
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,892
Do not let him take it

590
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,491

Save your soul and
leave alive!

597

See how many?

598

through cross them?

600
01:07:58,982 --> 01:08:01,183

603
01:08:06,212 --> 01:08:09,115
A lady chosen names you.

604
01:08:09,116 --> 01:08:12,770
Called  itself Vee to get out of the circle.

605
01:08:12,771 --> 01:08:15,939
Looking into his eyes I survived.

606
01:08:16,441 --> 01:08:18,442

O Pan Scientists pan Sotnik be angry

610
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:36,657
Took the money, but...

611
01:08:39,026 --> 01:08:41,027
's time to go.

612
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:04,617
What?

613
01:09:04,656 --> 01:09:06,834
Where is the highest place?

614
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:09,047
The old church.

615
01:09:11,945 --> 01:09:13,814
What?

616
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:15,816
Come on Peter.

617
01:09:39,945 --> 01:09:41,946
Well, what a scientist?

618
01:09:44,945 --> 01:09:47,519
Grabbed their belongings and ran away.

619
01:09:51,485 --> 01:09:56,831
Devil's work
sand begins to disappear from the circle.

620
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:01,939
Lord, what will happen to us now?

621
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:04,712
Go and pick up people.

622
01:10:15,775 --> 01:10:18,023
... And pan Sotnik asks for it.

623
01:10:18,024 --> 01:10:23,648
not you see there money...
1000 pennies, which I gave to Homa?

624
01:10:23,649 --> 01:10:25,926
I saw everything I saw.

625
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:29,695
Then, in the church.

626
01:10:31,864 --> 01:10:35,626
'll Take that secret confession.

627
01:10:42,314 --> 01:10:46,938
You know what you want as
, but I'm here.

628
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:49,810
Is this cursed place?

629
01:10:53,274 --> 01:10:55,275
Hold the rope.

630
01:11:01,154 --> 01:11:03,155
Peter, hold on tight.

631
01:11:10,154 --> 01:11:15,698
I go to the swamp and you
around the cursed place.

632
01:12:21,733 --> 01:12:23,911
I'll buy a new saddle.

633
01:12:43,812 --> 01:12:47,475
A coins, we have enough of everything.

634
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:52,233
Do you see how?

635
01:12:53,482 --> 01:12:56,056
Peter, hold on tight rope.

636
01:13:03,652 --> 01:13:06,028
I got it I got it...

637
01:13:43,521 --> 01:13:46,194
... pick up my instruments.

638
01:14:19,311 --> 01:14:24,725
You heard right, Teachings drank all
blood in Petros cursed place,

639
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:26,727
and got someone else.

640
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:34,725
Collect people, Father
Paisij you cry sermon.

641
01:14:34,726 --> 01:14:37,201
Pull up old devil...

642
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:46,554
Guess that undergone by me
tension in recent days and my tiredness,

643
01:14:46,555 --> 01:14:48,899
story became my first impressions.

644
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,119
Reminded me of pirates, buccaneers these

645
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,269
Without honor and conscience, which is
end his life,

646
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:58,769
hanged under
exhilarating delight of admiring audience.

647
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:04,314
I scared you not, my dear,
appearance sometimes lie.

648
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:19,359
... Until you look here,
teachings in the old church.

649
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,330
What you still hiding pittance?

650
01:15:47,899 --> 01:15:49,858
Failed.

651
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:54,093
We see,
cursed place, and exercises standing on the dome

652
01:15:54,094 --> 01:15:55,558
and Petros with him.

653
01:15:55,559 --> 01:16:00,938
Nothing Averki stay there if something happens,
teachings will die that night.

654
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:03,909
Tell me what to do next.

655
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,538
'll Find pan Sotnik, people believed in me,

656
01:16:12,649 --> 01:16:15,817
and is ready to punish the infidels.

657
01:16:16,519 --> 01:16:21,271
Pan  Sotnik wants to
memorial service for her daughter.

658
01:16:44,019 --> 01:16:46,791
Stay here, I'll need you.

659
01:17:02,188 --> 01:17:06,643
You do not stand in front of a pastor,
entitled to sue you,

660
01:17:06,978 --> 01:17:12,126
front of you is a slave and worm,
whom you can spit,

661
01:17:13,723 --> 01:17:15,724
But I urge you,

662
01:17:18,768 --> 01:17:21,142
not try to understand the reasons

663
01:17:21,143 --> 01:17:23,717
or when there is no reason...

664
01:17:25,898 --> 01:17:29,858
They say it's darkness and ignorance. Let.

665
01:17:30,518 --> 01:17:36,557
Expel yourself from those who
carry the light of knowledge.

666
01:17:38,358 --> 01:17:40,397
Where are you going...  Sotnik pan?

667
01:17:40,398 --> 01:17:44,952
Do not feel love
flock to Christ?

668
01:17:45,683 --> 01:17:47,684
Where?

669
01:17:50,398 --> 01:17:53,147
That we have a herd, it is so.

670
01:17:53,148 --> 01:18:01,051
Pan  Sotnik abandon us... and all the blame
is it stretched her veil and these scientists,

671
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:04,913
which I doubt that they are omniscient.

672
01:18:08,357 --> 01:18:13,010
Ah... my gold should
better to hide it.

673
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:18,770
You have nowhere to go from here learning.

674
01:18:24,187 --> 01:18:26,606
Fear newcomer.

675
01:18:26,607 --> 01:18:30,666
I see after it comes satanic army.

676
01:18:56,647 --> 01:19:03,180
Expel the devil away, so
earth burn beneath his feet...

677
01:19:38,976 --> 01:19:41,946
My tools were there.

678
01:19:41,976 --> 01:19:44,253
Petros, pick me up.

679
01:19:51,896 --> 01:19:54,765
What was that Peter? I do not understand.

680
01:19:54,766 --> 01:20:01,498
Pan Scientists tell you that this place is cursed
should run.

681
01:20:41,305 --> 01:20:43,483
Get to Sotnik...

682
01:20:48,855 --> 01:20:50,784
What did you see there?

683
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:52,786
Devil's work.

684
01:20:53,355 --> 01:20:54,934
And you're here.

685
01:20:54,935 --> 01:20:56,184
You have not been there.

686
01:20:56,185 --> 01:21:03,589
Curse noticed in relationships
Training and then not grumble!

687
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:04,644
Go...

688
01:21:04,645 --> 01:21:05,894
not understand...

689
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:08,667
Go on, make your work.

690
01:21:10,395 --> 01:21:14,354
Do not you okay you can not get up.

691
01:21:17,604 --> 01:21:19,782
Tomorrow I'll go there.

692
01:21:23,724 --> 01:21:25,725
... Dorothy...

693
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:37,508
You say you will not drop it from the top...
he returned from there.

694
01:21:37,509 --> 01:21:39,510
And went to Sotnik.

695
01:21:39,804 --> 01:21:41,143
Who?

696
01:21:41,144 --> 01:21:42,933
Teachings

697
01:21:42,934 --> 01:21:44,935
Bring him here.

698
01:21:47,434 --> 01:21:49,435
Who?

699
01:21:49,554 --> 01:21:51,555
Petros

700
01:21:58,974 --> 01:22:03,008
I asked them to fix it, and you smashed it.

701
01:22:03,009 --> 01:22:04,223
No.

702
01:22:04,224 --> 01:22:07,491
Not good, you exercise, you know...

703
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:19,184
Give it here

704
01:22:19,553 --> 01:22:21,554
What are you, Dorothy?

705
01:22:22,433 --> 01:22:24,434
What are you doing?

706
01:22:26,433 --> 01:22:31,284
Close  mouth, Dorothy,
will raise around Hutar.

707
01:22:34,013 --> 01:22:36,014
No, otherwise.

708
01:22:37,803 --> 01:22:41,337
Do not. Father Paisij,
joked and long.

709
01:22:41,338 --> 01:22:43,339
Come on.

710
01:22:45,353 --> 01:22:47,927
What are you doing this scientist?

711
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:54,908
Pan Sotnik send it there

712
01:22:55,553 --> 01:23:02,186
And promised him 1000 gold coins that you have forsaken in
cursed place.

713
01:23:02,393 --> 01:23:04,394
Bravo... bravo.

714
01:23:06,933 --> 01:23:12,477
Will now report to me
for all you know.

715
01:23:18,263 --> 01:23:21,530
Put ??it that people do not see.

716
01:23:24,262 --> 01:23:27,801
'll Leave, but will not serve ever.

717
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:34,237
... But this time do not miss teaching,
and I am going to gather people.

718
01:23:34,262 --> 01:23:36,263
Good.

719
01:23:40,642 --> 01:23:42,820
Where did you go mate?

720
01:23:45,682 --> 01:23:47,683
Mills.

721
01:24:11,602 --> 01:24:16,301
Scientists pan ... Paisij sent Cossacks.
Need to run.

722
01:24:16,302 --> 01:24:18,796
I'll come with you, but I have one condition.

723
01:24:18,797 --> 01:24:19,851
What?

724
01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:22,723
Nastosya'll take with you.

725
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:40,475
Nastosya, get ready, I came for you. Do not take anything superfluous.
I have a biscuit... I'll survive somehow.

726
01:24:45,051 --> 01:24:48,545
You might not agree. Can you hear me?

727
01:24:48,546 --> 01:24:51,615
Then get kidnapped, by God!

728
01:24:54,011 --> 01:25:02,921
Behold, I have prepared and rope, but will not
tie you and it will come, right Nastosya?

729
01:25:04,181 --> 01:25:06,182
So, no.

730
01:25:09,511 --> 01:25:11,512
Then you will go.

731
01:25:12,601 --> 01:25:16,462
'll Go... and you will not see me.

732
01:25:17,361 --> 01:25:21,519
Maybe then you'll cry for me. Farewell.

733
01:25:25,261 --> 01:25:28,330
Nastosya, my love, come with me.

734
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:34,219
Come on.

735
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:36,221
We are waiting for you in the boat.

736

Averki Averki... Where are you... my friend...

737

You took them.

01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:38,502
Well, what can you say

each other. Now what?

747
01:28:13,258 --> 01:28:15,259
Nastusya...

748

753
01:29:20,137 --> 01:29:22,414
Vee, horned monster.

754
01:29:22,967 --> 01:29:31,580
Behold, the time has come that the word of God with
fire and sword to punish the devil's spawn.

755
01:29:34,257 --> 01:29:36,435
Why so little?

756
01:29:43,797 --> 01:29:46,866
There are... It is better that you will not.

757
01:29:52,547 --> 01:29:54,547
Come, come with me.

758
01:30:07,546 --> 01:30:09,547
Not kill.

759
01:30:12,796 --> 01:30:14,797
Here it is... a witch.

760
01:30:30,886 --> 01:30:37,222
Paisij Father, if it is not Nastusya
and unclean, I myself saw it.

761
01:30:38,676 --> 01:30:44,715
Paisij Father, I saw it!
With seven horns. This is not Nastusya.

762
01:30:47,176 --> 01:30:49,177
What I did.

01:31:59,715 --> 01:32:01,716

764
01:32:23,174 --> 01:32:25,175

01:32:40,424 --> 01:32:42,701
Will not escape me.

766
01:32:43,504 --> 01:32:44,633
Map

767
01:32:44,634 --> 01:32:51,093
You, you do not need a map.
You wanted to find out what happened to your daughter.

768
01:32:51,094 --> 01:32:53,003
What do I know?

769
01:32:53,004 --> 01:32:55,677
I know what happened.

770
01:33:02,511 --> 01:33:04,512
You knew who?

771
01:33:06,261 --> 01:33:08,262
Get him

772
01:33:09,803 --> 01:33:12,475
All course animal...

773
01:33:13,094 --> 01:33:16,551
Find me will not spare any money.

774
01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:22,634
Condition for me to save and
Nastosya to ensure my safety.

775
01:33:22,635 --> 01:33:24,813
Now we will fix that.

776
01:33:36,302 --> 01:33:39,668
satanic deeds do here?

777
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:43,011
Run Nastusya!

778
01:33:43,635 --> 01:33:49,179
This girl hewed two
Dorothy in front of me and me...

779
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:52,244
What are you talking about, asshole.

780
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:53,606
Witch...

781
01:33:53,607 --> 01:33:55,009
Open!

782
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:56,884
Can.

783
01:33:56,885 --> 01:33:57,926
What?

784
01:33:57,927 --> 01:34:00,303
Unable . Is not allowed.

785
01:34:03,094 --> 01:34:05,371
Who is not allowed?

786
01:34:07,629 --> 01:34:09,630
From me.

787
01:34:10,052 --> 01:34:13,843
I would have kept
her tongue.

788
01:34:13,844 --> 01:34:16,912
Now the people do not dwell on.

789
01:34:28,343 --> 01:34:30,917
Here, Satan's seed.

790
01:34:32,259 --> 01:34:34,260
Get him!

791
01:34:47,551 --> 01:34:49,552
Keep it

792
01:34:59,259 --> 01:35:01,260
Do not!

793
01:35:01,968 --> 01:35:05,235
Throw him into the dungeon to the witch.

794
01:35:09,134 --> 01:35:11,807
And then interrogate him

795
01:35:13,676 --> 01:35:15,953
not run away from here.

796
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:19,927
Learning is light.

797
01:35:48,883 --> 01:35:51,382
Let's see what it says this scam.

798
01:35:51,383 --> 01:35:53,384
My dear Miss Dudley

799
01:35:53,967 --> 01:35:55,968
so

800
01:35:56,050 --> 01:36:04,267
Wings locals
closely resemble the wings of a flying type mice.

801
01:36:06,085 --> 01:36:09,917
In breadth they reach more than three meters.

802
01:36:09,918 --> 01:36:11,299
What?

803
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:18,799
Felt their fetid breath so close
if I reach out to touch their skin.

804
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,801
They also have copies.

805
01:36:22,675 --> 01:36:24,676
Hear that?

806
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:32,083
Remember  legged sailor whom he met in London
port

807
01:36:32,084 --> 01:36:35,351
He showed us a huge octopus.

808
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:45,425
Why are you crying?

809
01:36:46,674 --> 01:36:49,666
So long I did not get any letter
it.

810
01:36:49,667 --> 01:36:52,666
Forget about it, it
is not cause for tears.

811
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:54,668
Dad, please.

812
01:36:57,174 --> 01:37:04,791
So there's squid, ten times bigger than him...
has 6 eyes and call Vee.

813
01:37:04,792 --> 01:37:06,970
Yes. Completely crazy.

814
01:37:07,382 --> 01:37:12,332
If you go back, look at me
cursed place.

815
01:37:15,007 --> 01:37:19,561
O God, make it so that it
is true.

816
01:38:23,006 --> 01:38:26,867
Do not worry, I will not do anything.

817
01:38:27,631 --> 01:38:29,632
All is well.

818
01:38:36,131 --> 01:38:40,684
Swamp monster... ...
long you feed him?

819
01:38:45,172 --> 01:38:47,173
Month... year?

820
01:38:53,547 --> 01:38:55,548
This is a map,

821
01:38:56,214 --> 01:38:58,171
work of my whole life.

822
01:38:58,172 --> 01:39:00,944
Can not be lost without a trace.

823
01:39:02,582 --> 01:39:05,750
Wait, that's not my bookmarks.

824
01:39:08,339 --> 01:39:10,616
This is an escape plan.

825
01:39:13,672 --> 01:39:17,038
why the hell can not sit.

826
01:39:20,797 --> 01:39:23,371
I want power, ex pittance.

827
01:39:23,519 --> 01:39:25,697
Pittance are the temple.

828
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:31,345
Have to decide, she saw everything.

829
01:39:33,922 --> 01:39:37,288
I want to perform the ritual of the marsh,

830
01:39:37,839 --> 01:39:42,491
So that all be

Clever invented it.

832
01:39:49,713 --> 01:39:53,970
I want to know, what are these leather items.

833
01:39:56,129 --> 01:39:58,130
Go.

834
01:40:07,421 --> 01:40:10,193
Ha ha ha... what... a witch.

Where, sit down!

01:41:13,137 --> 01:41:15,138
Old Devil.

841
01:41:16,295 --> 01:41:18,296
Witch.

842
01:41:54,502 --> 01:41:56,251
Now there is no escape.

843
01:41:56,252 --> 01:42:00,212
And they say all the trouble comes from knowledge.

844
01:42:04,252 --> 01:42:05,640
What are you doing here?

845
01:42:05,641 --> 01:42:06,995
Just a great fit.

846
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:08,835
What miracles?

847
01:42:08,836 --> 01:42:11,707
From the holy water of Paissii,...

848
01:42:20,044 --> 01:42:22,786
Paisij cast spells she is still human.

849
01:42:22,787 --> 01:42:24,866
A lie, lie Yavtuh.

850
01:42:27,627 --> 01:42:29,628
Dog lie.

851
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:35,462
You want the truth?

852
01:42:39,294 --> 01:42:42,660
Because you become like a woman Yavtuh.

853
01:42:44,877 --> 01:42:50,619
Do you hear? When released into the water witch
it will fly.

854
01:42:53,836 --> 01:42:55,953
Can not you stay and keep it for me?

855
01:42:55,954 --> 01:42:56,876

Peter has prepared your fire escape to there.

860
01:43:36,835 --> 01:43:46,834
Go to the swamp. Stole two horses. You here this
hand, do not do anything, so you'll stay alive.

861
01:43:48,668 --> 01:43:52,133

862
01:43:53,793 --> 01:43:55,375

Thank you.

865
01:43:59,543 --> 01:44:02,810
It is possible this woman is a witch.

866
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,742
Paisij said take all stones.

867
01:44:10,743 --> 01:44:13,911
... And will test it in the water...

868
01:44:14,531 --> 01:44:17,303
If you swim, it's a witch.

869
01:44:40,584 --> 01:44:47,118
Brothers and sisters, punishment will overtake
anyone who does not listen.

870
01:44:48,994 --> 01:44:50,201
That's all...

871
01:44:50,202 --> 01:44:52,203

872
01:44:52,282 --> 01:44:54,029

Get out.

874
01:45:06,084 --> 01:45:08,085
Undone...

875
01:45:08,209 --> 01:45:12,790
What are you talking about. Are you dead?
What does that mean.

876
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:16,157
This means now I'm gone.

877
01:45:16,222 --> 01:45:19,228
Do not know where he was buried.

878
01:45:19,229 --> 01:45:22,165
There was nothing, nothing to bury.

879
01:45:22,166 --> 01:45:27,533
Here's what  hear me Peter,
have an opportunity to save Nastosya.

880
01:45:27,534 --> 01:45:29,535
I know who you saw.

881
01:45:30,166 --> 01:45:31,082
Who?

882
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:33,084
Sheepskin horn...

883
01:45:35,624 --> 01:45:40,825
Dress skin Distract them.
They will chase you understand?

884
01:45:40,826 --> 01:45:42,827
I understand... I .

885
01:45:43,427 --> 01:45:45,428
Get up and do it.

886
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:50,527
Led them to the cursed place.

887
01:45:59,666 --> 01:46:01,667
I do not know such a disgrace.

888
01:46:11,291 --> 01:46:13,292
Pity for the people.

889
01:46:14,124 --> 01:46:19,865
Now all come to
to face God's judgment.

890
01:46:28,873 --> 01:46:30,874
Vee.

891
01:46:34,582 --> 01:46:36,661
Watch  fell and fell.

892
01:46:40,623 --> 01:46:42,624
Stop, stop...

893
01:46:48,290 --> 01:46:50,291
Get it.

894
01:48:58,955 --> 01:49:00,956
What you were looking for?

895
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:13,081
Homa Brutus.

896
01:49:16,371 --> 01:49:19,143
Wants to kill me, right?

897
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:29,307
Taking my cards and avoid punishment.
We need your facts. Here's the facts.

898
01:49:30,246 --> 01:49:32,244
Young lady like you a lot.

899
01:49:32,245 --> 01:49:40,264
Understanding that u can not be equal,
you abused her and left her to die.

900
01:49:43,495 --> 01:49:49,930
It is believed that three days you will read
prayers over her. Will repent.

901
01:49:52,287 --> 01:49:54,465
But you turned out to be cruel.

902
01:49:55,079 --> 01:50:00,722
He knows who... This is
last words before death.

903
01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:07,283
It's just a skin. You scared the whole entire year
Hutar.

904
01:50:16,162 --> 01:50:19,132
I'll show people. Become!

905
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:21,661
What do you want from me?

906
01:50:21,662 --> 01:50:24,236
Tired, that's all.

907
01:50:36,619 --> 01:50:37,862
Whatever. Will not believe.

908
01:50:37,863 --> 01:50:39,864
Where did you get this...

909
01:50:40,161 --> 01:50:44,814
I have got out of the swamp and
unhook the bag.

910
01:50:45,994 --> 01:50:49,493
Here I am, because I knew that
will not believe.

911
01:50:49,494 --> 01:50:51,202
And what is your card?

912
01:50:51,203 --> 01:50:54,965
It was the only way of salvation.

913
01:51:07,286 --> 01:51:10,256
Where can I wear?

914
01:51:11,203 --> 01:51:17,987
Bursa? Not everyone can grasp how to leave this world.
Or you can accept me for the lady-killer.

915
01:51:17,988 --> 01:51:19,743
Dirty power.

916
01:51:19,744 --> 01:51:22,417
Guys, it's me, Homa.

917
01:51:24,328 --> 01:51:27,199
You sic Averki and Dorothy?

918
01:51:28,536 --> 01:51:30,535
Their greed  destroy them.

919
01:51:30,536 --> 01:51:36,971
Wait, how do you explain then that Miss
chosen names you.

920
01:51:40,453 --> 01:51:47,085
A year ago, I Vorobets and
Halyava gone astray in these parts.

921
01:51:52,118 --> 01:51:54,197
What's your name, boy?

922
01:51:56,702 --> 01:51:58,703
Homa  - philosophy.

923
01:52:03,285 --> 01:52:05,364
Come to my philosophy.

924
01:52:09,035 --> 01:52:13,094
Homa-a. Do not be afraid, I will not eat.

925
01:52:18,618 --> 01:52:20,796
At the first meeting I...

926
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:27,662
So, our fate was
one to meet.

927
01:52:52,617 --> 01:52:58,075
Nastosya would have thought that it
I have done so wearing the skin.

928
01:52:58,076 --> 01:53:02,135
She saw me, but only in the face of a monster.

929
01:53:08,534 --> 01:53:12,860
I live here all year and pray for the salvation of the soul
Miss.

930
01:53:12,861 --> 01:53:15,565
Terrible was the first three nights.

931
01:53:15,566 --> 01:53:18,239
What horrible not experienced.

932
01:53:18,826 --> 01:53:21,366
During the third night quite debilitating.

933
01:53:21,367 --> 01:53:25,327
When only sing the first roosters come from.

934
01:53:30,326 --> 01:53:32,327
Who, who is it?

935
01:53:32,819 --> 01:53:34,820
This is it!

936
01:53:53,033 --> 01:53:56,894
So what, are not you tired little devil?

937
01:53:59,658 --> 01:54:05,598
Now recognized me Homa? How do you
without her?... She seduced me.

938
01:54:12,658 --> 01:54:20,400
I was hoping you were dead, but you're alive.
I want to scare them, dress leather horns.

939
01:54:20,401 --> 01:54:25,648
tempt me... how
gleaming black and devilish eyes.

940
01:54:27,408 --> 01:54:32,407
But I do not sin. It has been said is not wrong
one who is tempted,

941
01:54:32,408 --> 01:54:38,532
and that which tempts and do not know what
find pleasure in playing.

942
01:54:38,533 --> 01:54:41,503
cause me disgust.

943
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:43,861
Help me.

944
01:55:05,449 --> 01:55:08,914
Whatever. Nobody will help you.

945
01:55:17,449 --> 01:55:19,450
Where you...

946
01:55:19,824 --> 01:55:20,608
What you ask?

947
01:55:20,609 --> 01:55:21,906
Drop it!

948
01:55:21,907 --> 01:55:28,031
'll Have to part with
cloak with his head.

949
01:55:28,032 --> 01:55:30,033
Base  fleeing.

950
01:55:34,865 --> 01:55:38,429
People want a miracle and I will give it.

951
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:42,862
Many years ago I went to a missionary in Europe

952
01:55:42,949 --> 01:55:48,196
and know how to create a new religion
, clean without miracles,

953
01:55:49,442 --> 01:55:52,566
by using your inventions.

954
01:55:52,567 --> 01:55:54,568
I'm the new prophet!

955
01:56:00,115 --> 01:56:02,116
And you will die.

956
01:56:04,489 --> 01:56:09,736
As a priest, I can not let
without repentance.

957
01:56:09,864 --> 01:56:11,943
Read your prayers.

958
01:56:26,781 --> 01:56:28,782
Nastusya!

959
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:37,990
Nastusya...

960
01:56:47,448 --> 01:56:49,449
Nastusya.

961
01:56:51,239 --> 01:56:56,585
I want to know that your life is
is not in the hands of God

962
01:56:58,156 --> 01:57:00,157
and mine.

963
01:57:00,489 --> 01:57:04,449
I decide who lives and who dies.

964
01:57:06,114 --> 01:57:08,115
Be damned!

965
01:57:23,988 --> 01:57:25,989
Freedom.

966
01:57:27,072 --> 01:57:30,042
Little Daniel, um. Forgive me.

967
01:57:36,572 --> 01:57:42,809
I'm ashamed to admit, but cruel
I lied about your father.

968
01:57:42,863 --> 01:57:51,080
Trust me, he's a great, good man.
This is his letters from him to your mother.

969
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:59,321
Which I intend to publish.

970
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:08,529
I want the whole world to know what was wrong
judge a man so foolish as me.

971
01:58:10,322 --> 01:58:12,862
Are unfortunate Bruno burned in the fire,

972
01:58:12,863 --> 01:58:17,317
then realized
that the earth is round.

973
01:58:20,821 --> 01:58:26,068
Now  letters are in your hands, yes.
Now they are in you.

974
01:58:32,446 --> 01:58:34,361
Jonathan!

975
01:58:34,362 --> 01:58:41,193
Ah, another dove. Now we know
with you how this story ends.

976
01:58:41,987 --> 01:58:43,230
Yavtuh, where are you going?

977
01:58:43,231 --> 01:58:44,111
Here.

978
01:58:44,112 --> 01:58:45,695
Is not you afraid?

979
01:58:45,696 --> 01:58:47,611
Cossack  must not be afraid of anything.

980
01:58:47,612 --> 01:58:53,849
To know that your life is not
in the hands of God, and mine.

981
01:58:56,654 --> 01:59:00,614
I decide who lives and who dies.

982
01:59:01,487 --> 01:59:06,239
Paisij cries while
fire everywhere heard.

983
01:59:11,821 --> 01:59:13,822
cursed!

984
01:59:50,111 --> 01:59:52,112
Mother.

985
02:00:06,903 --> 02:00:08,904
A miracle.

986
02:00:14,653 --> 02:00:17,319
Felt the breath of god

987
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:25,811
and his touch that changed my destiny.
Never before or since I have not experienced anything like that.

988
02:00:25,812 --> 02:00:30,069
All my previous life flashed before me.

989
02:00:31,110 --> 02:00:35,401
I thought I
who will continue after my death.

990
02:00:35,402 --> 02:00:38,966
Honey, I want you to have a child.

991
02:00:40,027 --> 02:00:45,728
What you need to know what
were friends with your landlord.

992
02:00:45,729 --> 02:00:47,730
Quiet!

993
02:00:51,235 --> 02:00:54,478
Evil was punished and I got a fee.

994
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:57,350
Here are the coins of Sotnik.

995
02:01:09,402 --> 02:01:11,403
Peter.

996
02:01:15,527 --> 02:01:24,437
Body and soul of the ladies found
rest and father and received mental balance.

997
02:01:26,027 --> 02:01:33,748
A Homa, perhaps with his mistrust of
scientist, something like this seminarian.

998
02:01:35,401 --> 02:01:40,477
If fate has chosen me and that is a
resulted in this God-forsaken place,

999
02:01:40,478 --> 02:01:44,537
to finish the story he read in January

1000
02:01:57,151 --> 02:01:59,230
This is a magic lantern

1001
02:01:59,693 --> 02:02:03,653
miracle created by the genius of humanity

1002
02:02:10,276 --> 02:02:17,372
That can build or destroy, in
depending on what hands fall.

1003
02:02:17,373 --> 02:02:25,392
Once the images will come to life, and we will see
wonderful city and wonderful people.

1004
02:02:29,526 --> 02:02:31,527
Paisij you found?

1005
02:02:32,359 --> 02:02:35,328
No, I never saw it anywhere.

1006
02:02:36,025 --> 02:02:37,857
Is Dead

1007
02:02:37,858 --> 02:02:46,669
Two unusual rat with an unnatural size,
came, sniffed, sniffed and passed.

1008
02:02:57,983 --> 02:02:59,899
All grandmothers are witches.

1009
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:04,652
those who are older,
even bigger witches.

1010
02:03:38,150 --> 02:03:40,151
Hell.

1011
02:03:41,482 --> 02:03:43,483
What is it?

1012
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:48,141
Scientists pan, one for the road?

1013
02:03:48,142 --> 02:03:48,481
Drank.

1014
02:03:48,482 --> 02:03:50,148
For Lent?

1015
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:51,565
Drank.

1016
02:03:51,566 --> 02:03:53,645
Memento pan Scientists?

1017
02:03:54,732 --> 02:03:56,733
I'm not drinking.

1018
02:03:58,107 --> 02:04:00,108
This is a Cossack.

1019
02:04:01,149 --> 02:04:03,150
Spirit.

1020
02:04:03,982 --> 02:04:05,983
Pick up, pick up.

1021
02:04:36,691 --> 02:04:41,641
I never really knew where to put
gear.

1022
02:04:41,982 --> 02:04:46,349
Now, when the country went out and my mind cold
progressive researcher

1023
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:50,605
Again  possessed feelings
I can ascertain,

1024
02:04:50,606 --> 02:04:58,265
all fantastic events of recent days,
appear as the fruit of the imagination of the human brain

1025
02:04:58,266 --> 02:05:03,018
Which is a little more
studied by modern science.
