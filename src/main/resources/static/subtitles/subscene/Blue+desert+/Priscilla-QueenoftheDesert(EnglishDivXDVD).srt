1
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:29,757
<i>Hey, lady, you, lady</i>

2
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:32,590
<i>Cursin' at your life</i>

3
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,228
<i>You're a discontented mother</i>

4
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:40,549
<i>And a regimented wife</i>

5
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:44,793
<i>I've no doubt you dream about</i>

6
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:48,554
<i>The things you never do</i>

7
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:52,401
<i>But I wish someone
had've talked to me</i>

8
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:56,050
<i>Like I wanna talk to you</i>

9
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,640
<i>Ooh, I've been to Georgia
and California</i>

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,240
<i>And anywhere I could run</i>

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>Took the hand of a preacher man</i>

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,531
<i>And we made love in the sun</i>

13
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:16,427
<i>But I ran out of places
and friendly faces</i>

14
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:19,590
<i>Because I had to be free</i>

15
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,944
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

16
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:28,329
<i>But I've never been to me</i>

17
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:34,869
<i>Please, lady
Please, lady</i>

18
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:37,918
<i>Don't just walk away</i>

19
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:40,915
<i>'Cause I have this need to tell you</i>

20
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:45,462
<i>Why I'm all alone today</i>

21
00:01:46,113 --> 00:01:49,657
<i>I can see so much of me</i>

22
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:53,095
<i>Still living in your eyes</i>

23
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:57,508
<i>Won't you share a part
of a weary heart</i>

24
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:01,084
<i>That has lived a million lies?</i>

25
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:05,342
<i>Oh, I've been to Nice
and the isle of Greece</i>

26
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:08,781
<i>While I sipped champagne
on a yacht</i>

27
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:13,435
<i>I've moved like Harlow
in Monte Carlo</i>

28
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:16,093
<i>And showed 'em what I've got</i>

29
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:19,273
<i>I've been undressed by kings</i>

30
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,306
<i>And I've seen some things</i>

31
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:25,521
<i>That a woman ain't s'posed to see</i>

32
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:31,648
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

33
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,357
<i>But I've never been</i>

34
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:40,241
<i>To me</i>

35
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:43,863
<i>Ooooh</i>

36
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,651
<i>I've been to paradise...</i>

37
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:51,771
<i>Never been to me.
More! More!</i>

38
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,691
More!

39
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:56,731
Oh, please!

40
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:59,091
Next!
Put it away, sweetie!

41
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:05,883
Ugh!

42
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,521
Are you OK?
Yeah.

43
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:15,121
That was fuckin' charming,
you gutless pack of dickheads.

44
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:17,761
Fuck off, you talentless dog!
What was that?

45
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:19,761
Show us your pink bits!
No!

46
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:22,401
Know why this microphone
has such a long cord?

47
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:26,684
So it's easily retrieved
after I've shoved it up YOUR arse.

48
00:03:35,363 --> 00:03:37,240
Christ almighty!

49
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:41,082
What the fuck's
going on out there tonight?

50
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,602
Are you hurt?

51
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,909
Alright, which one of you bitches
sat on my dress?

52
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:50,394
Tick, darling, it's for you.

53
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:54,683
Hello.
Ding dong, Avon calling.

54
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:57,675
Howdy, sunshine. Long time no hear.

55
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:02,216
Where?
Emergency ward A.

56
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,751
Mr Belrose?

57
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:10,140
Yes?

58
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:14,614
So... how about it?

59
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,108
Leave him alone!
Fuck off!

60
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,679
Get... get off him!

61
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,190
Taxi! Taxi!

62
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:41,321
Yeah?

63
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,821
Bernadette? It's Tick.

64
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:46,807
Sorry to call you so late, but I...

65
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49,295
Hey, are you OK?

66
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:51,215
No, I'm not.

67
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:54,138
Well... what's the matter?

68
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:55,822
Trumpet just died.

69
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:06,343
"...and established it on the floods."

70
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:09,729
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

71
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,360
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,283
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

73
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,403
"He restoreth my soul.

74
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:20,043
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness..."

75
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:21,643
"...for his name's sake.

76
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:25,443
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

77
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:28,079
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

78
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,508
"Thy rod and staff comfort me.

79
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:34,172
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

80
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:38,283
"Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

81
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:42,648
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all my life,

82
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:45,997
"and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

83
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,523
It's not fair.

84
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:52,523
I spent half my life
and all my savings

85
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,342
trying to snag
a sympathetic husband.

86
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:57,973
And the selfish little shit
goes and dies on me.

87
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:03,654
25 years old, and he goes
and slips over in a bathroom.

88
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,181
He didn't slip.

89
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:09,678
He was peroxiding his hair at home
and he asphyxiated on the fumes.

90
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:14,055
I need some space.

91
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:17,458
I've, um... been asked to do a show
out of town.

92
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,954
That's nice.
Well, why don't you come with me?

93
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:23,705
I'll need some help, and...
we could both use the break.

94
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,670
You're not wrong. Where is it?

95
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,942
Um... Alice Springs.

96
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:31,562
You've got to be fucking joking!

97
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:38,928
Wo-Man is a... unique range
of speciality facial products

98
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:44,653
designed for the more...
heavy-duty woman in us all.

99
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:48,500
Now, um... this week...

100
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,206
Excuse me.

101
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:52,979
Um... hello?

102
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,319
How long is the run?

103
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:57,883
Four weeks.

104
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,283
Equity minimum, two shows a night,
accommodation included.

105
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:06,243
I can't just sit around here
crying all the time.

106
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:10,328
Jesus! My mascara keeps running.
I look like a raccoon.

107
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:12,963
Good girl!
That's the spirit.

108
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:16,803
Here's hoping the desert's
big enough for the two of us.

109
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,523
Um... three of us.

110
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,123
<i>A desert holiday</i>

111
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,682
<i>Let's pack the drag away</i>

112
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:26,929
<i>You take the lunch and tea
I'll take the ecstasy</i>

113
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:29,166
<i>Fuck off, you silly queer</i>

114
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,688
<i>I'm getting out of here</i>

115
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:34,034
<i>A desert holiday
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray.</i>

116
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:39,384
Why?

117
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:41,180
Why not?

118
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:44,363
Look, he's turned into
a bloody good little performer.

119
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,843
That's right.

120
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:47,483
A bloody good little performer.

121
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:50,123
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

122
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:52,443
I thought we were escaping
this shit.

123
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:55,163
Two's company, three's a party,
Bernadette my sweet.

124
00:07:55,163 --> 00:08:00,374
We're unplugging our curling wands
and going bush, Felicia.

125
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:02,657
Why would you possibly
leave all this glamour

126
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,043
for a hike into nowhere?

127
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:07,530
You really want to know?
Desperately.

128
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:11,656
Well, ever since I was a lad
I've had this dream -

129
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:16,465
a dream that I now, finally,
have a chance to fulfil.

130
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,953
And that is...?

131
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:20,187
To travel to the centre
of Australia,

132
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:23,151
climb Kings Canyon - as a queen -

133
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:28,004
in a full-length Gaultier sequin,
heels and a tiara.

134
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,778
Great. That's just what
this country needs.

135
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,818
A cock in a frock on a rock.

136
00:08:34,853 --> 00:08:37,830
Get back in your kennels,
both of you.

137
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:41,192
Now, the first thing
we have to work out...

138
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:44,544
...is how the hell we get there.

139
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,237
Ta-da!

140
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:01,896
What do you think?

141
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:05,008
When do we have to
return it to the school?

142
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,624
We don't. We own it.

143
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,200
What?!

144
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,636
Well, I met some nice 'Svedish'
tourists called Lars, Lars and Lars

145
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,516
and I coaxed it out of them
for $10,000.

146
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:20,125
We can't afford it.
Well, that's right.

147
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:23,648
"Mummy,
maybe a trip to the outback

148
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:26,859
"would help me get over this little
'phase' I'm going through.

149
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,416
"And you never know - I might meet
some lovely country girl."

150
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:35,054
I hereby christen
this budget Barbie camper...

151
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,673
...Priscilla -

152
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:38,372
Queen of the Desert.

153
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:44,588
That's got to be the understatement
of the century.

154
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:05,568
Mum!

155
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,906
Ladies and gentlemen!

156
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:15,351
We're here today to see off
a very brave woman

157
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:18,090
who will attempt to cross
a continent alone.

158
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,165
On behalf of all her sponsors...

159
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,761
Ladies...

160
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:40,500
...start your engines.

161
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:13,144
<i>This old man
He played two</i>

162
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,404
<i>He played knick-knack
with my poo...</i>

163
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,162
<i>Please!
Knick-knack paddy-whack...</i>

164
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:20,049
<i>Give me a break!
This old man came rolling home.</i>

165
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:23,577
<i>Four fat trannies
working on the wall</i>

166
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:27,021
<i>And if one fat trannie
should accidentally fall...</i>

167
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:31,939
<i>My darling Clementine</i>

168
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:34,879
<i>Da da da da...</i>

169
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,724
How long have we been on the road?

170
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:43,162
4 and a half hours.

171
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:46,514
I've got
a splitting headache already.

172
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:52,152
Happy hour!
Mother's ruin pour moi.

173
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:56,210
Long Island tea...
And a Stoli and tonic for me.

174
00:11:57,814 --> 00:12:01,945
Stupid cow.
Well, listen to this one.

175
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,443
After we did the Abba show,

176
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:06,514
Kevin had one of those liposuction
penis enlargements.

177
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:07,651
He didn't?
Yep.

178
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,590
Know what they do?

179
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,787
They siphon fat
from your love handles

180
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,422
and inject it into your wing-wang.

181
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:15,444
Ugh! Yucky!

182
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:18,191
It gives a new meaning
to "cracking a fat", though.

183
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,262
Baaa-aaaa! Baaa-aaaa!

184
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:26,955
Listen to yourselves! You sound like
two fat slags at a pie bake-off.

185
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,154
Well, your contribution
to the conversation

186
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:31,251
hasn't exactly
made headlines, Bernice.

187
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:34,276
Gee, poor Kevin's dick.

188
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:36,352
There can't be much room down there

189
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,776
with his brain taking up
so much space already.

190
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:42,146
No, I'll join this conversation

191
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:45,674
on the proviso that we stop
bitching about people,

192
00:12:45,674 --> 00:12:48,662
talking about wigs,
dresses, bust sizes,

193
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:52,693
penises, drugs, nightclubs
and bloody Abba!

194
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:55,913
Doesn't give us much
to talk about then, does it?

195
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:59,845
Hey, can you confirm
a rumour for me?

196
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,793
Is it true her real name's Ralph?
Shh!

197
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,518
How do you like
your little boys, girls?

198
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:16,371
You don't have to answer that.

199
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:21,351
Oh, my God. What is this -
'Outback with Benny Hill'?

200
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:24,463
Just leave mine outside the door
at about 8am

201
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:27,327
along with an orange juice
and toast, please.

202
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,236
Why, certainly, madam.

203
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:31,974
Would you like
vegemite or jam with that?

204
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:38,158
Er... knock knock. Room service.

205
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:40,897
Can't you read the sign -
"Do not disturb"?

206
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:44,048
Come back in the morning.
Ha ha. Open the door.

207
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,069
Goodnight, Bernice.
Goodnight, Mitzi.

208
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:50,857
Open the fucking door!

209
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:58,700
OK, if you don't open the door...
I'm gonna sing.

210
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,597
Fine. You asked for it.

211
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:07,050
<i>I don't care
if the sun don't shine</i>

212
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,967
<i>I get my loving
in the evening time</i>

213
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,973
<i>When I'm with my baby</i>

214
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:15,870
<i>It's no fun with the sun around</i>

215
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:18,025
<i>'Cause I get going
when the sun goes down</i>

216
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:21,744
<i>And I meet my baby...</i>

217
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,936
<i>That's when we kiss
and kiss and kiss</i>

218
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:27,011
<i>And then we kiss some more</i>

219
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,418
<i>Don't ask how many times...
Night, John-boy.</i>

220
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,484
Waaah!

221
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:36,706
I'm seriously falling asleep.

222
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:40,291
It's your shift
and you're sticking to it.

223
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,947
Serves you right
for staying out all night... slut.

224
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,649
Well, I won't make it.

225
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:47,388
<i>I don't care
if the sun don't...</i>

226
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,923
Oh, fuck off, grandma.

227
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,832
You alright?

228
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:52,907
Me? Yeah. I'm fine.

229
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:55,356
I'm just thinking.

230
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,680
Sorry.

231
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,158
Shit!

232
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,654
What is it?

233
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:51,263
Perhaps we should've flown.

234
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:11,388
Bzzt! Wrong! But thanks for playing.

235
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,923
Anyone else?
No!

236
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:15,372
Witchetty grub. Your turn.

237
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:19,273
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with 'R'.

238
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:21,431
Rectum.
No.

239
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:23,464
Ring pirate.
No.

240
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:25,000
Road.

241
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,864
Alright, that's it.
What's the matter with you?

242
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,693
Nothing, darling.
Don't 'darling' me, darling.

243
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,825
Look at you.
You've got a face like a cat's arse.

244
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,961
Now 'fess up.
Just... worried about the show.

245
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,577
We haven't done
any rehearsals yet...

246
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,772
We've got two weeks!
There's plenty of time to rehearse.

247
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:43,245
Now, what is your problem?

248
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,161
Not a problem. I just...

249
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:48,042
I just want this show to be good.
That's all. Gonna be good.

250
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:50,657
How the fuck
did you get this job, Mitzi, my Darling?

251
00:16:50,657 --> 00:16:54,807
Who is the fish that runs this bloody hotel
in the middle of nowhere, anyway?

252
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,882
Your mother?
No, my wife.

253
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,633
Ooh, don't tell me
you've got an ex-boyfriend

254
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,092
tucked away out here somewhere.

255
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:03,554
No, my WIFE!

256
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:06,219
I'm married.

257
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:22,430
And when the joint bank account
ran dry after a couple of years...

258
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:27,126
...I guess I preferred her wedding
ring to mine, so... no drama.

259
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:29,533
We swapped and called it a day.

260
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:32,472
This is getting too weird.

261
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,582
YOU and a woman.

262
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:38,829
What did she do for kicks?

263
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:41,992
Put a bucket on your head
and swing off the handle?

264
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:45,881
You know, there are two things
I don't like about you, Felicia.

265
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,308
Your face! So how about shutting
both of them?

266
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:52,896
Well, at least this explains
your abysmal batting average, Mitz.

267
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:55,916
I often wondered
why your dance card was so empty.

268
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,660
You never got a divorce, then?

269
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,650
Well, girls, what can I say?

270
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,223
Here's to a secret very well kept.

271
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:07,962
Shame it won't stay that way,
isn't it?

272
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:13,011
Mmm! Got any more little surprises
you'd like to share with us?

273
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:16,502
Haven't got any kids
stashed away out there, have you?

274
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,528
Look...

275
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:25,099
...I haven't lied about anything.

276
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:30,771
After six years I get phone call
out of nowhere, screaming for help,

277
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:33,586
and Christ knows
I owe her some favours.

278
00:18:36,597 --> 00:18:39,985
I'm sorry that I never told you.

279
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:43,636
I'm not sorry
that you're here.

280
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:53,075
Don't worry about it, dolls.

281
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,930
I'm as jealous as all hell.

282
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:08,105
What?

283
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,707
So, was it a big wedding?

284
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:13,448
Get lots of pressies, did you?

285
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:16,567
I wish I was OLD enough
to have been there.

286
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:17,913
Oh, ha ha.

287
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,523
I would've bought you

288
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:22,203
a lovely matching set
of hers and hers bathmats.

289
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:25,173
Oh, give it a rest.
Not on your life!

290
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:29,966
Oh, imagine! Mitzi the magnificent
and her blushing bride.

291
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:33,953
Mowing those lawns must've been
murder on your heels, though.

292
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:36,024
Alright, Felicia. That's enough.

293
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,282
Let's put some money in that seething
cesspool mouth of yours.

294
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:40,606
If I win this game,

295
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:44,815
you will NEVER mention my wife EVER
in my presence again, OK?

296
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,754
And if I win?
Name your price.

297
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,234
Well, now...

298
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:50,962
What would I like

299
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:54,010
more than anything else
in the whole wide world?

300
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,733
Snap!

301
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:56,028
Better be quick.

302
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,635
What the fuck am I doing?

303
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:20,465
Take that bloody frock off, Felicia -
don't make it worse than it is.

304
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:24,562
You think I'm gonna let YOU get
all the attention? No chance!

305
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:27,253
Come on, girls. Let's go shopping.

306
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:30,621
Oh, for Christ's sake!

307
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:34,231
<i>I love the night-life
I've got to boogie</i>

308
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:38,921
<i>On the disco
Ah-ha, oh, yeah</i>

309
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:42,158
<i>Oh, I love the night-life</i>

310
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,233
<i>I've got to boogie</i>

311
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:48,375
<i>On the disco
Ah-ha, oh, yeah...</i>

312
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,821
Oh, I just adore these hats!

313
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:55,260
<i>Please don't talk
about love tonight</i>

314
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,659
<i>Your sweet talking
won't make it right</i>

315
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,700
<i>Loving lies
just bring me down</i>

316
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,394
<i>When you've got women
all over town</i>

317
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:08,469
<i>You can love them all</i>

318
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:10,212
<i>And when you're through</i>

319
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:11,913
<i>Maybe they'll make...</i>

320
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:14,735
You've got to be kidding!

321
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:16,355
Welcome to Mario Palace!

322
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:19,090
Come in. Come in.

323
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:21,707
Come in.

324
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:23,782
What can I do for you?

325
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,482
You'd like a room, madam?

326
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,756
Subtle.

327
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:42,623
Oh, tackarama!

328
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:44,989
Who does all the painting
around here?

329
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:48,890
Someone with no arms or right foot,
by the look of things.

330
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,263
Ugh, for goodness sakes
get down off that crucifix!

331
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:53,994
Someone needs the wood.

332
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:56,980
What have we here?!

333
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:02,530
What fun! Baby bottles of booze!

334
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:03,615
Oh!

335
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:07,467
Gather round, girls -
let me show you a trick.

336
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:09,930
You, um, drink the gin...

337
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,910
Ah!

338
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,881
...ah, fill the bottle with water
and... put it back in the fridge.

339
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,720
Va-t'en vous.
What about the Scotch?

340
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,774
Ah... that's where the complimentary
tea bags come in handy.

341
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,797
Very clever.
Cheers, girls.

342
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:29,723
And congratulations, Mitzi darling.
You did it.

343
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,789
One lap of the Broken Hill main drag
IN drag.

344
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:34,516
That'll teach you to take on

345
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,603
the Fairmont Boys School
snap champion.

346
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:39,524
Here's to being off the fucking bus.

347
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,156
Chookers.

348
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:43,259
Chookers.
Chookers.

349
00:22:45,413 --> 00:22:49,022
So... all dolled up
and nowhere to go.

350
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:52,881
I sure as shit am not going to sit
in here all evening.

351
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:53,840
I'm in!

352
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:59,385
Oh, alright.

353
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,976
Here's hoping they have
a decent cocktail bar.

354
00:23:22,555 --> 00:23:24,091
Hello.

355
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:27,914
Could I please have
a Stoli and tonic,

356
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:31,329
a Bloody Mary
and a Lime Daiquiri, please?

357
00:23:31,564 --> 00:23:33,587
Well!

358
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:37,378
Look what the cat dragged in!

359
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,442
What have we got here, eh?

360
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:45,186
A couple of showgirls, have we?

361
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:48,978
Where did you ladies come in from?

362
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:50,314
Uranus?

363
00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:54,271
Could I please have a Stol...
No!

364
00:23:53,971 --> 00:23:56,129
Ya can't have!

365
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:58,044
Ya can't have nothin'.

366
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,924
We've got nothin' here
for people like you. Nothin'!

367
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:13,227
Now listen here, you mullet.

368
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:17,709
Why don't you just light your tampon
and blow your box apart?

369
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:21,391
Because it's the only bang
you'll ever get, sweetheart!

370
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:41,696
<i>I get my loving
in the evening time</i>

371
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:46,801
<i>When I'm with my baby</i>

372
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:49,083
<i>Oh, it's no fun...</i>

373
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,598
What could be
more soothing

374
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:59,075
than coming home after
a hard day's work down the mine

375
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,705
to the wo-man in us all?

376
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,667
Now, don't send any money. OK?

377
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:08,834
Ooh!

378
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:15,846
Ooh!

379
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,086
Ooh!

380
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:33,415
Oooooh!

381
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,724
OOOOH!

382
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:55,103
Shit!

383
00:25:56,127 --> 00:26:00,235
All I can see
is female impersonators.

384
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,852
This has got to be a first.

385
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:11,599
Nobody's ever outdrunk
old Shirl before.

386
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:14,621
Where'd you learn
to throw 'em back like that?

387
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,015
That's our girl, Bernadette.

388
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:20,636
Stumbling around the pub circuit
with Les Girls for 200 years

389
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:21,853
must've taught her something.

390
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:24,501
You're a bloody marvel,
Bernie.

391
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:27,007
Bernadette, please.
What's that?

392
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:30,792
My name isn't Bernie.
She said her name isn't Bernie.

393
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:35,669
It's Ralph!

394
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:39,185
Come on! Oh!

395
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:42,336
Oh! Oh!

396
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:48,974
What did you call me?
"What did you call me" what?

397
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,284
What did you call me
back there in the bar?

398
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,461
Sorry... Ralph!

399
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:58,752
You fucking idiot! Oh!

400
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:00,589
Oh! Fuck!

401
00:27:00,624 --> 00:27:03,794
Oh! Fuckin'... Oh! Fuck!

402
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:05,935
Get off me, you fuckin'... Oh! Fuck!

403
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,067
Don't worry.
It's only my fucken head!

404
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:12,563
At least the bump on your head's
bigger than your prick!

405
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:14,923
Why don't you ust get fucked,
you stupid old fist?!

406
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:16,938
Oh, piss off, you little faggot!

407
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,909
Listen, you're so bloody boring...

408
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:20,567
If your mouth was as big
as your dick...

409
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,756
Good morning.
Morning.

410
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,660
It's funny, you know.

411
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,473
No matter how tough
I think I'm getting...

412
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,283
...it still hurts.

413
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,880
Hope it still works.

414
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,204
Don't have much call for it here.

415
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:04,237
Where are you blokes from?

416
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:07,667
Uranus.
Oh, good.

417
00:28:17,827 --> 00:28:19,363
There! Left!

418
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,894
I hope you know what you're doing.

419
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:26,943
If we stick to the sealed road
we'll be at it for at least another two days.

420
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:32,504
Take the short cut.

421
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:28,873
One more push,
I'm gonna smack his face so hard

422
00:29:28,908 --> 00:29:32,522
he'll have to stick his toothbrush
up his arse to clean his teeth.

423
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:37,165
Just lay off!

424
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,878
I told you not to use the 'R' word.
What did you go and do?

425
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:43,338
I was only having fun.
Fun?

426
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:45,793
What else do you do for amusement -
slam your fingers in car doors?

427
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:47,960
What's the point?

428
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,906
I like seeing people get hot-headed. Okay?
It gives me a kick

429
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:55,222
Is it true when you were born
the doctor turned around and slapped your mother?

430
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:59,725
What sort of... bent childhood
did you have, Adam Whitely?

431
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,688
Adam! Adam!

432
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,089
Come in here, boy.

433
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:10,486
Come and sit over here.

434
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:17,217
Would you like
to have some fun with Uncle Barry?

435
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:19,500
We're gonna play a SPECIAL game,

436
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,865
but you can't tell anybody

437
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:25,849
ever, ever, ever, OK?

438
00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:29,626
Now, I want you
to put your hand down here

439
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:32,482
and pull very gently, OK?

440
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,804
Very gently.

441
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,453
That's good. That's good.

442
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:44,317
Ooh!

443
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:47,305
Jesus Christ, Adam!
Get help!

444
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:51,538
Adam, Uncle Barry's penie-pie
is caught in the drain.

445
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:53,571
Get Mummy. Get Mummy!

446
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:56,933
No!
Whaddya mean 'No'?!

447
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:59,789
Never, ever, ever!

448
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:04,112
You know the best part?

449
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,206
Mum was out playing golf

450
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:10,478
and the dirty old fuck
was stuck there for seven hours!

451
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:12,760
I thought they were
small and wrinkled

452
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:15,084
BEFORE they got in the water!

453
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,111
Hey, I've got a joke.

454
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:27,177
Who wants to hear a joke?

455
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:30,909
Come on, Bernice, it's so funny,

456
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:33,689
you'll laugh SO hard,
your lashes will curl by themselves.

457
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:36,500
Do tell us your hilarious joke.

458
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:37,880
OK.

459
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:41,082
Well, once upon a time,
many moons ago,

460
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:44,656
there was a famous bunch of Indians
called the Fuck-are-we tribe.

461
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:49,228
One day, the son of the great
Indian chief says to his father,

462
00:31:49,263 --> 00:31:53,127
"Dad, why is my friend Little Hawk
called Little Hawk?"

463
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,695
And his father says...

464
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,242
"Why do you ask..."
"Two Dogs Fucking?"

465
00:31:57,277 --> 00:31:59,916
That's NOT the end of the joke.

466
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,963
So anyway, back to me.

467
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:06,309
Jesus!
What's happening?

468
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:08,672
Um... I don't know.

469
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:25,243
Oh, my God.

470
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,273
Oh, Felicia.

471
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:48,002
Where the fuck are we?

472
00:32:56,993 --> 00:33:01,432
Shit! Shit! Shit!

473
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,121
Oh, shit!

474
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,609
Well, I've had a look around

475
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:28,303
and we can safely assume
that I now know less about motors

476
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:32,079
than I did when I lifted up
that, uh... that bonnety thing.

477
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,196
Now what?

478
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:37,640
Let's not think about it yet
and eat brekkie, shall we?

479
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,591
Oh, that's a novel idea.

480
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:41,790
Let's stuff ourselves to death.

481
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,699
Imagine the headlines.

482
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:46,687
'Whales beach themselves
in the outback'.

483
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:49,675
'Mystery bumsticks dead in drag'.

484
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:52,069
There's no point walking back.

485
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:55,636
The only life I've seen
is hypnotised bunnies

486
00:33:55,636 --> 00:34:01,369
and they're now
mostly wedged in the tyres.

487
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:04,657
Yes, and toast marshmallows
and chill champagne for their arrival.

488
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:06,806
What if they DON'T drive past?

489
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:09,896
Look, you're not helping here.
Just eat your hormones.

490
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,833
"Help". Why didn't we stick
to the main road?

491
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:16,125
What difference does it make?!
You started this, Anthony Belrose.

492
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,225
And I suggest start thinking about
how to get us back

493
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,812
or I don't fancy your chances
of being a husband again.

494
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:29,257
Jesus. What are we gonna do?

495
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:31,318
We're gonna start
with a little face-lift.

496
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:34,860
Nothing like a new frock
to brighten up your day.

497
00:34:37,732 --> 00:34:39,761
Purple?!

498
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:43,005
It's not PURPLE. It's lavender.

499
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:44,527
Whaddya think?

500
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:47,975
Oh, it's nice...
in a hideous sort of a way.

501
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,875
Where are you going?

502
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,950
If you think I'm sitting around

503
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,813
watching Picasso
take on the public transport system

504
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:57,764
you've got another thing coming.

505
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:01,011
I'll be back with the cavalry
in a couple of hours.

506
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:04,742
There goes a transsexual.
Last seen heading south.

507
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:07,319
We called her Bernie,
but her real name was...

508
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:08,496
Adam!

509
00:35:52,033 --> 00:36:00,314
Oooee!

510
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:03,618
Oooee!

511
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,344
Aaaggh!

512
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:03,355
Oh!

513
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:06,963
Help! Help!

514
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:10,580
What's that, Pa?
What?

515
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,516
Up there, yer nong.

516
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:14,311
Looks like a woman!

517
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:16,733
Help!

518
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:19,977
Oh, thank God.

519
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:28,664
Thank you.

520
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:33,115
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

521
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:34,183
<i>...face...</i>

522
00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:36,509
<i>I just walked in
to find you here</i>

523
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:38,916
<i>With that sad look
upon your face...</i>

524
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:51,324
You fucken beauty!

525
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:02,156
Ooh, ooh, shit. Ooh.

526
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:04,854
Aaah! Bernie,
I'm so glad to see you!

527
00:39:04,654 --> 00:39:07,766
I wish I could say the same.

528
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:11,957
I was just drawing up the will.
Come and meet our saviours.

529
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,108
Tony, Adam,
this is Mr and Mrs Spencer.

530
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:17,307
Hello!
Hello!

531
00:39:19,384 --> 00:39:21,780
Stop! Stop!

532
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:27,589
Shit.

533
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:31,295
Oh, for goodness sakes,
look at yourself, Mitz.

534
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:35,071
How many times do I have to tell you
green is not your colour?

535
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,413
Do you think about Trumpet much?

536
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:44,947
No.

537
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:50,509
Trumpet was just a nice kid
who had a thing about transsexuals.

538
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,086
Lots of people do.

539
00:39:52,086 --> 00:39:55,680
Sort of...
bent status symbol, you know.

540
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,088
"My girlfriend used to be
a boyfriend" - that sort of thing.

541
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:01,015
Always good for a supper invite.

542
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:04,657
Still... it was better than nothing.

543
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:10,210
Nothing. Nothing for miles.

544
00:40:14,236 --> 00:40:17,348
<i>Can you hear
the drums, Fernando...</i>

545
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,461
I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

546
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,411
No more fuckin' Abba.

547
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:26,146
OK, we may as well
put the time to good use.

548
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:28,595
Come on, girls. Off your snatches.

549
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,130
Rehearsal time.

550
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,666
<i>Nah, nah, nah...</i>

551
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:34,239
<i>And so you're back
From outer space...</i>

552
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,646
OK? Two bobs to start with, alright?

553
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:39,094
Boring.
Ready?

554
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:41,501
<i>Da da da da</i>

555
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:43,203
<i>Dee dee dee dee</i>

556
00:40:43,203 --> 00:40:44,946
<i>Dee dee dee dee dee dee</i>

557
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:46,647
<i>This look upon your face...</i>

558
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:48,722
Oh, I did this years ago.

559
00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:53,163
You did it SO beautifully
and darling, you do it SO well.

560
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:55,528
Right, from the top.

561
00:40:55,528 --> 00:40:57,064
One, two...

562
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:58,931
<i>Go on, now go</i>

563
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:00,757
<i>Walk out the door</i>

564
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,874
<i>Just turn around now</i>

565
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:05,447
<i>'Cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

566
00:41:05,447 --> 00:41:09,057
<i>Weren't you the one who tried
to hurt me with goodbye...</i>

567
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:11,453
Aaaagh!

568
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:15,988
Hello.

569
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:17,522
Nice night for it.

570
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:25,740
<i>Feel alright</i>

571
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,724
<i>Yes, I feel alright</i>

572
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:36,198
<i>Well, I feel alright
with you right by my side...</i>

573
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,646
I think we just... crashed a party.

574
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:02,880
No, come on.
You'll be right.

575
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:19,258
Welcome to my office. Have a seat.

576
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:34,720
Bernice, what possibly possessed
you to wear THAT to a corroboree?

577
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,132
Shut your face.

578
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:56,420
Bravo!
Fabulous!

579
00:42:59,987 --> 00:43:03,221
Well, girls, I guess it's our turn.

580
00:43:10,362 --> 00:43:14,180
<i>At first I was afraid
I was petrified</i>

581
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,781
<i>Kept thinking I could never live
without you by my side</i>

582
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:23,333
<i>But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong</i>

583
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,223
<i>And I grew strong</i>

584
00:43:25,258 --> 00:43:27,703
<i>And I learned how to get along</i>

585
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,807
<i>And so you're back
From outer space</i>

586
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:35,564
<i>I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face</i>

587
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,712
<i>I should have changed
that stupid lock</i>

588
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:39,878
<i>And made you leave your key</i>

589
00:43:39,913 --> 00:43:43,965
<i>If I'd known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me</i>

590
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,279
<i>Go on now go</i>

591
00:43:45,314 --> 00:43:47,388
<i>Walk out the door</i>

592
00:43:47,423 --> 00:43:49,540
<i>Just turn around now</i>

593
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:52,365
<i>'Cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

594
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,378
<i>Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye</i>

595
00:43:56,413 --> 00:44:00,634
<i>Did you think I'd crumble
Think I'd lay down and die?</i>

596
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:02,167
<i>Oh, no, not I</i>

597
00:44:02,202 --> 00:44:04,101
<i>I will survive</i>

598
00:44:04,136 --> 00:44:08,771
<i>As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive</i>

599
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:13,054
<i>I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give</i>

600
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:16,249
<i>And I'll survive
I will survive</i>

601
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:18,887
<i>Hey, hey...</i>

602
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:27,461
Hey, take a look at that.

603
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:33,603
Ooooh!
I've got an idea!

604
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:37,509
<i>It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart</i>

605
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:41,493
<i>Just trying hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart</i>

606
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:45,726
<i>And I spent, oh, so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself</i>

607
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:49,876
<i>I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high</i>

608
00:44:49,876 --> 00:44:51,494
<i>And you see me</i>

609
00:44:51,494 --> 00:44:53,818
<i>Somebody new</i>

610
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:57,761
<i>I'm not that chained-up little
person still in love with you</i>

611
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:02,118
<i>So you felt like dropping in
and just expect me to be free</i>

612
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:05,853
<i>Now I'm saving all my lovin'
for someone who's lovin' me</i>

613
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:08,509
<i>Go on now go</i>

614
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:10,377
<i>Walk out the door</i>

615
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:15,191
<i>Just turn around now 'cause
you're not welcome anymore...</i>

616
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:23,566
So... you actually make money
by dressing up like a woman?

617
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:28,048
Oh, sure. You can make
a fine living in a pair of heels.

618
00:45:28,048 --> 00:45:30,951
Why, Allen? Do you want a job?

619
00:45:40,374 --> 00:45:43,818
Oh! If only this dress could talk.

620
00:45:43,818 --> 00:45:46,640
Sometimes I wonder
where I get my taste from.

621
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,176
Definitely not my mother.

622
00:45:48,176 --> 00:45:51,941
Serves me right for letting her
buy me these awful clothes.

623
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:55,603
What's this?

624
00:45:57,015 --> 00:46:01,165
That, darling, is my most treasured
possession in the whole wide world.

625
00:46:01,165 --> 00:46:03,240
But what is it?

626
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,017
Well, a few years ago I went on a pilgrimage
backstage to an Abba concert,

627
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:10,378
hoping to grab an audience
with Her Royal Highness, Agnetha.

628
00:46:10,378 --> 00:46:13,076
Well, when she ducked
into the ladies loo,

629
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:14,777
naturally I followed her in...

630
00:46:14,777 --> 00:46:16,852
...and after
she'd finished her business

631
00:46:16,852 --> 00:46:18,595
I ducked into the cubicle

632
00:46:18,595 --> 00:46:22,372
only to find she'd left
a little gift in the toilet bowl.

633
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:24,530
What are you telling me?

634
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,807
This is an Abba turd?

635
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:33,450
I know what we can do with THIS.

636
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,984
Are you right?

637
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:37,768
Hang on!

638
00:46:37,768 --> 00:46:39,636
OK! Go!

639
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:44,192
Whoo-hoo!

640
00:47:01,672 --> 00:47:03,955
There! Whoo-hoo!

641
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:36,445
Afternoon.
What seems to be the problem?

642
00:47:41,864 --> 00:47:43,939
What a nice dog.

643
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,416
What's its name?

644
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:46,950
Herpes.

645
00:47:47,696 --> 00:47:50,221
If she's good, she'll heel.

646
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,439
Things get pretty quiet around here.

647
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:57,406
We're a bit starved
of entertainment.

648
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,995
Glad we could oblige.

649
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,301
How does it look?

650
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:05,021
Well, your gas tank's
chock-a-block full of crud.

651
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:09,420
Travelling a rough road on
a low tank chucks it into the motor.

652
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,827
Your fuel line's blocked,
injectors are stuffed...

653
00:48:11,827 --> 00:48:15,894
So does that mean you can fix it?
In the short term.

654
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:19,006
What you blokes need
is a new gas tank.

655
00:48:19,006 --> 00:48:21,754
Don't suppose
there's one lying around?

656
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:23,250
No, sorry.

657
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:25,978
Could pick one up
in Coober Pedy in about a week.

658
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:28,999
When do you have to be in Alice?
Six days.

659
00:48:30,045 --> 00:48:33,490
We can clear it out
and hope for the best.

660
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,440
You might make it.

661
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,723
Won't know unless you try.

662
00:48:37,723 --> 00:48:40,047
Refreshments!

663
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:42,620
Lemonade here - I make!

664
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,400
That's very nice, darling.
Please... go back inside.

665
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,471
Lemonade here - I make.
Lemonade for guests.

666
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:51,293
No, darling, please!

667
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:53,772
I make chockrit cracker!

668
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:59,095
Thank you!

669
00:48:59,095 --> 00:49:00,631
We put cream on?

670
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:03,038
Er... no, no.
It's... um... face cream.

671
00:49:03,038 --> 00:49:05,445
It's for face.
Ah!

672
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:09,678
Bob, Cynthia - thank you.

673
00:49:09,678 --> 00:49:11,711
I love lamb with meringue.

674
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:13,413
Thank you for the company.

675
00:49:13,413 --> 00:49:17,148
Like I said earlier, new faces
are pretty hard to come by here.

676
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:19,555
Should I may asking?
Need you off the highway?

677
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,335
Oh, now,
that's a bloody good question.

678
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:26,552
Glad you bothered. Don't get
your type out here very often.

679
00:49:27,149 --> 00:49:31,882
Me like to sing too - me like...
Yeah, pretty damn quiet.

680
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:34,478
Thought about opening
a video business,

681
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,895
but I suppose we gotta wait
for television first.

682
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,620
Me perform for you. Me dance too.

683
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:42,475
My wife was in the, uh...
entertainment business.

684
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,267
Yeah. You perform here?

685
00:49:45,302 --> 00:49:46,972
You thinking of performing here?

686
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,947
I mean, you'll be here
at least another night.

687
00:49:49,982 --> 00:49:53,548
Um... well, the thought
hadn't really... crossed my mind.

688
00:49:53,548 --> 00:49:57,212
Well, I'll talk to Wally at the pub.
Everybody would love it.

689
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:01,710
Oh, I'm not sure our show
would go down too well out here.

690
00:50:02,715 --> 00:50:06,072
Should I may asking.
What kind of cabaret do you do?

691
00:50:06,022 --> 00:50:08,097
We dress up in women's clothes

692
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:11,790
and parade around mouthing the words
to other people's songs.

693
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,235
You mean, sort of like them...
what are they called?

694
00:50:15,235 --> 00:50:16,770
Les Girls?

695
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:20,215
Yeah, I've seen 'em in Sydney
when I was young!

696
00:50:20,215 --> 00:50:21,875
Fantastic! Just terrific!

697
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:27,892
Bob, you are looking at probably the
most famous Les Girl ever produced!

698
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:30,839
You're kidding me!
Give me a break.

699
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,827
I was never that famous.
I'm not joking.

700
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:37,064
What? I mean,
I wouldn't have seen you, but...

701
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:40,342
That was 30 years back.
Oh, you'd be surprised.

702
00:50:40,342 --> 00:50:42,417
Me perform for you. Me sing...!

703
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:45,447
No, Cynthia. You no perform.
They perform, not you.

704
00:50:52,045 --> 00:50:54,784
Well! A real live Les Girls show.

705
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:57,098
Right, this calls for a celebration.

706
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:05,203
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
Oh, shut your twat.

707
00:51:05,238 --> 00:51:07,930
Our frocks were the sensation
of Broken Hill, remember?

708
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:11,359
Broken Hill had a K-Mart.
They knew what a frock was.

709
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,385
Christ, you should see
what this woman is wearing.

710
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,697
It's not a frock.
It's a piece of corrugated iron!

711
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,952
Can I come in?
Only if you're single!

712
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:32,882
Oh, you look, uh... incredible.

713
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,134
Where did we find guy?

714
00:51:35,169 --> 00:51:37,193
Keep dishing out
the compliments, Bob.

715
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:38,480
Flattery gets you everywhere.

716
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,074
Now, where's
that lovely wife of yours?

717
00:51:40,352 --> 00:51:44,365
She's at home. She's, uh...
not allowed in the pub anymore.

718
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,876
Really? Why?

719
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:51,059
She got problem of alcohol - everytime she's in
the pub she makes a fool of herself.

720
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:53,171
I know how she feels.

721
00:51:55,126 --> 00:51:59,040
Well, we're all waiting.
Are you ready?

722
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:00,728
Bob...

723
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:03,343
...we're having second thoughts.

724
00:52:03,343 --> 00:52:07,004
You can't back out.
Every man and his dog's here.

725
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,711
They're not chained up are they?
Oh, you blokes!

726
00:52:10,746 --> 00:52:12,482
Sorry. You girls.

727
00:52:12,482 --> 00:52:14,457
You'll be fine.
Take my word for it.

728
00:52:50,464 --> 00:52:54,656
<i>There's nothing more
that I'd like to do</i>

729
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:57,561
<i>Than take the floor
and dance with you</i>

730
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:05,812
<i>Keep dancing
Let's keep dancing</i>

731
00:53:10,301 --> 00:53:12,697
<i>Shake it! Shake it!</i>

732
00:53:17,688 --> 00:53:19,971
<i>Shake it! Shake it!</i>

733
00:53:19,971 --> 00:53:24,522
<i>Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah!</i>

734
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:29,516
<i>Show them how to do it now
Show them how to do it now!</i>

735
00:53:30,316 --> 00:53:31,850
YEAH!

736
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:35,781
Yeah, right.

737
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:41,750
Here she goes!

738
00:54:20,614 --> 00:54:22,680
What the hell is going on?

739
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:48,956
Oh, she's not!

740
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:51,210
Is she?

741
00:54:51,976 --> 00:54:56,047
Oh, you can't do that
with a ping-pong ball!

742
00:54:57,205 --> 00:54:58,905
Do you want a bet?

743
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:11,188
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh!

744
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:30,196
Help me!

745
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:32,727
He's taking me away! Help me!

746
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:42,627
I'm going!

747
00:55:42,627 --> 00:55:45,034
Darling, there's nothing
we can't work out.

748
00:55:45,034 --> 00:55:47,732
You no good man.
Now, don't be silly.

749
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:51,010
You want good wife -
you be good husband.

750
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,044
Darling, don't go.

751
00:55:53,044 --> 00:55:56,774
I no like you anyway.
You got little ding-a-ling.

752
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:14,432
Some days you just shouldn't
get out of bed.

753
00:56:14,432 --> 00:56:17,042
In my opinion, you should wait here

754
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,246
until I get back from Coober Pedy
with the new gas tank

755
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:22,690
Then again,
you listened to my last opinion.

756
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:26,591
Forget it, Bob.
It's time we made a move.

757
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,934
I'm just a gifted amateur
around here.

758
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,880
There's no way a nice frock
and a catchy tune

759
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:35,350
can compete with three ping-pong
balls, two cigarettes and a pint of beer.

760
00:56:35,385 --> 00:56:39,622
I'll play it safe and stick
to the main drag, pardon the pun.

761
00:56:39,622 --> 00:56:41,158
Well, goodbye, Bob.

762
00:56:41,158 --> 00:56:43,767
Thanks for a very educational stay.

763
00:56:43,802 --> 00:56:46,265
I'd love to be able
to open a bottle like that.

764
00:56:46,677 --> 00:56:50,073
Bernadette,
it's certainly been an honour

765
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,440
meeting a member of Les Girls.

766
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,121
And it's been an honour
to meet a gentleman.

767
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:58,732
Believe me, Bob, these days
gentlemen are an endangered species.

768
00:57:00,746 --> 00:57:05,849
Unlike bloody drag queens
who just keep breeding like rabbits!

769
00:57:11,787 --> 00:57:14,808
Oh, fuck it!

770
00:57:16,154 --> 00:57:20,344
Bob! Fancy a free ride
to Coober Pedy?

771
00:57:25,906 --> 00:57:28,811
Now, listen, Bob.
Let's get one thing straight.

772
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:32,961
We wear the frocks, but that
doesn't mean you wear the pants.

773
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:34,663
Right. Where do I sleep?

774
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:36,738
Oh! Anywhere that takes your fancy!

775
00:57:36,738 --> 00:57:39,133
The roof will do me fine.

776
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:42,174
Thank you, Bob.

777
00:57:42,174 --> 00:57:44,249
I don't know what to say.

778
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:48,856
That's alright. Might as well get
there earlier. Bit of R and R.

779
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,051
God knows I need it.

780
00:58:14,835 --> 00:58:18,777
Can I ask you a personal question,
if you don't mind?

781
00:58:18,777 --> 00:58:21,350
Sure.
Why?

782
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:24,537
Why do you... you know?

783
00:58:26,413 --> 00:58:29,609
You mean the $64,000 question?

784
00:58:29,609 --> 00:58:33,205
That's the girl.
Don't tear the wrapping paper.

785
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,782
Just slide the ribbon off and we can
see what Santa's brought you.

786
00:58:37,817 --> 00:58:39,557
Here it comes now.

787
00:58:39,592 --> 00:58:41,622
What is it?

788
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:44,602
Oh, it's a... It's a...

789
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,984
...cement mixer.

790
00:58:50,483 --> 00:58:54,130
Have you been changing the cards
around again, Ralph?

791
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:01,347
So, I guess I had no choice
in the matter.

792
00:59:01,382 --> 00:59:04,846
For fuck's sake! Watch where
you're driving, you stupid bitch!

793
00:59:04,846 --> 00:59:06,606
You trying to fucken kill me or something?

794
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:07,991
My fault!

795
00:59:08,026 --> 00:59:10,647
Sorry, Bob.
I thought it was Bernadette.

796
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:17,592
One-two-three, two-two-three,
three-two-three...

797
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:19,294
Now you're getting it.

798
00:59:19,294 --> 00:59:21,618
Who taught you to waltz?
My wife.

799
00:59:21,618 --> 00:59:23,153
Oh, how sweet.

800
00:59:23,153 --> 00:59:26,349
You and the missus down at
Arthur Murray's every Tuesday

801
00:59:26,349 --> 00:59:27,967
practising your hearts out.

802
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:29,959
Makes me want to sick up.

803
00:59:29,959 --> 00:59:31,495
Married?

804
00:59:31,495 --> 00:59:33,238
Yes, married.

805
00:59:33,238 --> 00:59:35,366
We've only recently discovered

806
00:59:35,366 --> 00:59:37,859
young Anthony here
bats for both teams.

807
00:59:37,894 --> 00:59:40,612
I do not!
Oh, so we're straight?

808
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:42,603
No.
Oh, we're not?

809
00:59:42,638 --> 00:59:44,261
We're a donut puncher after all?

810
00:59:44,296 --> 00:59:45,968
No.
Then what are we?

811
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,506
I don't fucking know!

812
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:52,328
What the fuck's that?

813
00:59:56,602 --> 00:59:59,051
Good evening.

814
00:59:59,051 --> 01:00:01,224
Nice night for it.

815
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:04,715
Oh, OK. Goodnight then.

816
01:00:04,903 --> 01:00:07,481
What a rude woman.

817
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:21,231
And that's the power steering pump.
And that's the radiator fan.

818
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:23,140
How interesting.
Simple.

819
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,543
That's the rubber band
that drives the whole thing...

820
01:00:26,543 --> 01:00:29,364
Oh! Yes!

821
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:33,349
Hey! Who wants first bath?

822
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:35,009
Whoo-ooh!

823
01:00:49,236 --> 01:00:50,772
I won!

824
01:01:01,196 --> 01:01:02,895
Can I help you, ma'am?

825
01:01:12,691 --> 01:01:14,517
OK! Turn her over!

826
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:36,546
<i>I don't care
if the sun don't shine</i>

827
01:01:36,546 --> 01:01:39,285
<i>I get my loving in the evening time</i>

828
01:01:39,285 --> 01:01:43,726
<i>When I'm with my baby</i>

829
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:46,506
<i>It's no fun with the sun around</i>

830
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:49,619
<i>But I get going
when the sun goes down</i>

831
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:53,852
<i>And I meet my baby</i>

832
01:01:53,852 --> 01:01:57,296
<i>That's when we kiss
and kiss and kiss</i>

833
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,454
<i>And then we kiss some more</i>

834
01:01:59,454 --> 01:02:02,733
<i>Don't ask how many times we kiss</i>

835
01:02:02,733 --> 01:02:05,513
<i>At a time like this
who keeps score?</i>

836
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,626
<i>So, I don't care
if the sun don't shine</i>

837
01:02:08,626 --> 01:02:11,365
<i>I get my loving in the evening time</i>

838
01:02:11,365 --> 01:02:15,555
<i>When I'm with my baby!</i>

839
01:02:36,865 --> 01:02:38,723
That's it over there.

840
01:02:38,723 --> 01:02:42,311
It's an OK room - with a shower.
Bags first!

841
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:43,976
Is hot water all you think about?

842
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:48,085
No. A shower, bed
and nice meal will do fine.

843
01:02:48,085 --> 01:02:51,340
If you think I'm just going to
watch television, you're wrong.

844
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,364
Now, look.
You blokes watch your back.

845
01:02:53,364 --> 01:02:55,257
It's a pretty tough little town.

846
01:02:55,257 --> 01:02:58,920
They go down holes, blow things up,
then come up again.

847
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,741
That sums things up.
Oh, fabulous!

848
01:03:00,741 --> 01:03:04,235
You're welcome to hang out with us, Bob.
If you got nothing better to do.

849
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:08,646
Yeah. I'm meeting some of the boys
in the old drive-in for a booze-up.

850
01:03:08,681 --> 01:03:09,685
Like the old days.

851
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:12,064
I want to go to the boys club!

852
01:03:12,064 --> 01:03:17,322
You'll have supper with us
or stay in your room and watch TV.

853
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:43,480
Ha!

854
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,375
He's a good man, our Bob.

855
01:03:47,217 --> 01:03:49,209
Yeah.

856
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:51,118
Not my type, though.

857
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:54,106
Oh! Don't come the raw prawn with me!

858
01:03:54,106 --> 01:03:57,592
I can spot the fluttering
of a beaded lash from 300 paces!

859
01:03:57,592 --> 01:04:00,578
Oh, get out! He's far too old.

860
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,683
Mind you, so am I.
Mmm.

861
01:04:05,726 --> 01:04:08,122
Did you catch that mail-order bride?

862
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:12,153
Why'd he marry? I'm dying to ask.

863
01:04:13,694 --> 01:04:16,890
Oops! Sorry.
It's alright.

864
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,591
Don't worry about it.

865
01:04:18,591 --> 01:04:21,413
You're the world's best husband.

866
01:04:21,413 --> 01:04:24,930
And, given the chance,
a perfectly good father too.

867
01:04:26,435 --> 01:04:28,219
Do you really think so?

868
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:30,579
Why? Thinking about children?

869
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,859
Yes, as a matter of fact.

870
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:54,275
Um, do you have
'The Texas Chainsaw Mascara'?

871
01:04:58,182 --> 01:04:59,718
You ever wanted kids?

872
01:04:59,718 --> 01:05:04,323
Sure. But I've learned
not to think about it.

873
01:05:07,063 --> 01:05:10,383
You think an old queen's
capable of raising a child?

874
01:05:10,383 --> 01:05:13,330
Well, Elizabeth did
a pretty good job.

875
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,213
Prince Charles is a wonderful boy.

876
01:05:16,248 --> 01:05:19,497
Edward's still a bit of a worry.

877
01:05:20,592 --> 01:05:23,912
What happens
if they turn out like Adam?

878
01:05:23,912 --> 01:05:27,412
You stuff them back in
and ask for a refund.

879
01:05:30,303 --> 01:05:31,838
Stupid little shit.

880
01:05:32,876 --> 01:05:35,823
I dread to think what he's up to.

881
01:06:00,681 --> 01:06:02,546
Oooh.

882
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:05,246
Hello.

883
01:06:05,246 --> 01:06:07,394
I'm new in town.

884
01:06:08,483 --> 01:06:10,890
No kidding.

885
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:13,463
Could I have a bloody Mary, please?

886
01:06:13,463 --> 01:06:17,063
It's a beer or nothing... sweetheart.

887
01:06:18,111 --> 01:06:20,507
Well, I'd better have a beer then.

888
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:23,465
Cheers.

889
01:06:27,573 --> 01:06:29,639
What are you all looking at?

890
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:34,295
I'm sorry.

891
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:39,857
Didn't mean to stare.
We don't usually get women down here.

892
01:06:39,857 --> 01:06:41,393
Oh.

893
01:06:41,393 --> 01:06:46,740
So what do women do around here
besides watching videos?

894
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:51,678
Well, well, well!
Look who we have here.

895
01:06:53,952 --> 01:06:56,437
You know that bloke, do you?

896
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,634
No.

897
01:07:02,973 --> 01:07:08,022
So... who's going to show me
the sights?

898
01:07:08,202 --> 01:07:11,285
It'd be my pleasure.

899
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,164
Oh.

900
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:16,957
So, how about it?

901
01:07:19,324 --> 01:07:23,177
I suppose a fuck's
now out of the question.

902
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:30,230
Get her, Frank!
Go, Frank!

903
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:36,354
Come on, boys! Who wants to see
my map of Tasmania?

904
01:07:37,527 --> 01:07:42,001
So. I never got a chance to tell my parents
what a wonderful childhood I'd had.

905
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:49,556
They never spoke to me again
after I'd had... the chop.

906
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:57,401
I think I have something
to tell you.

907
01:07:57,401 --> 01:08:00,679
Oh, shit.

908
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:03,039
Get after her!

909
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,192
OK, fellas!
Don't forget how to treat a lady.

910
01:08:18,192 --> 01:08:19,727
You fucking freak!

911
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:24,791
Hold him down.

912
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:26,368
Spread his legs apart.

913
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,232
Oh, no. Please, don't!

914
01:08:30,227 --> 01:08:32,385
Frank, stop!

915
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:35,373
Stop! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?!

916
01:08:35,373 --> 01:08:37,780
You mean you do know
this cocksucker.

917
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,440
Get off him, you mongrel!

918
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,507
He was joking, OK?
You leave the little bugger alone.

919
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:45,209
Get out of there, Bob.

920
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:46,786
Calm down, Frank.

921
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:50,841
Put the faggot down and get out
or you'll be next.

922
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,942
Frank!
Get out of there!

923
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:56,455
Stop flexing your muscles
you big pile of budgie turd.

924
01:08:56,455 --> 01:08:59,542
I'm sure your mates will be much more impressed

925
01:08:59,577 --> 01:09:03,436
if you go back to the pub
and fuck a couple pigs on the bar.

926
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:04,631
Bernadette, please...

927
01:09:04,631 --> 01:09:06,747
Bernadette?!

928
01:09:06,747 --> 01:09:11,097
Well, I'll be darned.
The whole circus is in town.

929
01:09:11,132 --> 01:09:13,742
I suppose you want a fuck too,
do you?

930
01:09:13,777 --> 01:09:16,002
Come on, Bernadette.
Come and fuck me.

931
01:09:16,002 --> 01:09:17,951
That's it.

932
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:21,355
Come on. Come and fuck me.

933
01:09:21,355 --> 01:09:24,177
Come on.

934
01:09:24,177 --> 01:09:25,712
Fuck me.

935
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:34,894
There, now you're fucked.

936
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:38,903
You stupid bloody idiot!
Drugs, for Christ's sake!

937
01:09:38,903 --> 01:09:42,318
Well, three cheers for you!
I hope you're happy now!

938
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:45,205
You bloody fuckwit!

939
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:50,446
It's funny.

940
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,186
We all sit around

941
01:09:53,186 --> 01:09:56,833
mindlessly slagging off
that vile stink-hole of a city.

942
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:02,606
But in its own strange way
it takes care of us.

943
01:10:02,606 --> 01:10:06,756
I don't know if that ugly wall
of suburbia's been put there

944
01:10:06,756 --> 01:10:11,488
to stop them getting in
or us getting out.

945
01:10:14,019 --> 01:10:15,553
Come on.

946
01:10:16,799 --> 01:10:19,372
Don't let it drag you down.

947
01:10:19,372 --> 01:10:22,094
Let it toughen you up.

948
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:25,787
I can only fight
because I've learnt to.

949
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,090
Being a man one day
and a woman the next isn't easy thing to do.

950
01:10:34,354 --> 01:10:37,313
Sorry. Can't help you.
No worries, Pete.

951
01:10:40,732 --> 01:10:43,844
Are we bunny-hopping
all the way to Alice?

952
01:10:43,844 --> 01:10:47,289
Not good. This is the man
to help's a fair way out of town.

953
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:48,949
Like how fair?

954
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:50,650
Couple of hundred klicks fair.

955
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:55,008
No matter. I've go nothing else
to do today. Let's get out of here.

956
01:10:55,008 --> 01:10:57,074
Come on, Adam. We're not here.

957
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:28,935
Some things are said
in the heat of the moment.

958
01:11:31,892 --> 01:11:35,046
I'm sorry I got angry with you
last night.

959
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:37,453
Oh, I dare say you deserved it.

960
01:11:37,453 --> 01:11:39,932
Anyway, that's enough of that.

961
01:11:41,561 --> 01:11:45,338
This is quite an experience
sitting her with you now.

962
01:11:45,338 --> 01:11:47,373
I can quite safely say

963
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:52,240
that I think your taste in clothing
is absolutely terrible

964
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,023
because you can't say a word,
can you?

965
01:11:54,966 --> 01:11:57,622
Oh, this is great fun!

966
01:12:01,242 --> 01:12:04,770
We're going to have a problem
finding this guy with the tank.

967
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,509
Why say that?
Because he's not out here.

968
01:12:07,509 --> 01:12:09,904
He's out here. He's in Alice.

969
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:13,858
I can't go back to Coober Pedy
for a while.

970
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:16,962
I'm not the most popular bloke
back there anymore.

971
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,528
Ooof!

972
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:31,496
Hello.

973
01:12:31,496 --> 01:12:33,571
Hello!

974
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,510
Who are you?
I your wife!

975
01:12:39,505 --> 01:12:42,535
Guess I'll be going home then.
You no going!

976
01:12:42,535 --> 01:12:44,942
I coming too. I your wife!

977
01:12:44,942 --> 01:12:47,432
See? I your wife!

978
01:12:47,432 --> 01:12:49,590
Silly girl.

979
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,448
Should've done her homework better.

980
01:12:52,483 --> 01:12:56,013
She always thought...
She thought I was from Sydney.

981
01:12:56,048 --> 01:12:58,388
Why in gods name did you bring her home?

982
01:12:58,388 --> 01:13:00,821
She was me wife.

983
01:13:00,856 --> 01:13:02,438
Couldn't you sell her off?

984
01:13:02,473 --> 01:13:05,671
Oh, the party's over, everyone.
It talks.

985
01:13:05,706 --> 01:13:07,962
Can't keep a good bitch down.

986
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:11,206
What time
will we be in Alice Springs?

987
01:13:12,094 --> 01:13:13,630
Late tomorrow arvo.

988
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,705
How long will you be staying?

989
01:13:15,705 --> 01:13:17,240
Don't know.

990
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,940
A couple of days maybe.

991
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:23,756
A big day for you tomorrow!
We'll all meet the missus!

992
01:13:23,756 --> 01:13:25,457
I saw that smile, Felicia!

993
01:13:25,457 --> 01:13:28,235
One word, one derogatory word

994
01:13:28,235 --> 01:13:30,349
and I'll take you back
to your mate in Coober Pedy.

995
01:13:32,346 --> 01:13:34,595
Please, everyone.
Tomorrow will be tough.

996
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:36,528
Look.
Please don't make it any harder, then I has to be.

997
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:41,020
We're only teasing. We won't open
our mouths until you give the word.

998
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,719
And then it's open season.

999
01:13:56,748 --> 01:13:58,740
Oh, well. Time for bed.

1000
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:01,147
Got to look good for the wife in the morning.

1001
01:14:01,147 --> 01:14:03,762
Come along, Adam.
Time for your beauty sleep.

1002
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:05,920
Come on!

1003
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,985
Will you two be joining us?

1004
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:12,145
I just thought a little
I'd have one for the road.

1005
01:14:12,145 --> 01:14:13,680
How about you, Bob?

1006
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,257
Sounds good to me.

1007
01:14:15,257 --> 01:14:17,789
Alright, then.
See you in the morning.

1008
01:14:17,789 --> 01:14:19,862
Goodnight!

1009
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:23,725
Another piece of cake, Bob?

1010
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:26,463
Ah, no.
Oh.

1011
01:14:30,531 --> 01:14:34,681
So... tell me about you.

1012
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:38,267
Can't complain.

1013
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:40,010
Life's a lot simpler now.

1014
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:42,500
Spent 30 years
wandering around the world

1015
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,560
only to find I was better off
where I started.

1016
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:50,219
Not much, but it's my turf.

1017
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,919
Oooh! Shit!

1018
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,814
Adam!

1019
01:15:09,766 --> 01:15:11,965
Adam!

1020
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,526
What?
Guess who didn't come home?

1021
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:25,204
I've waited all my life for this.

1022
01:15:25,204 --> 01:15:28,939
Bernice has left her cake
out in the rain!

1023
01:15:34,085 --> 01:15:38,027
<i>Hava nagila
Have a hangover</i>

1024
01:15:38,027 --> 01:15:41,057
<i>Hava nagila
Hi hi hi!</i>

1025
01:15:42,883 --> 01:15:46,365
<i>Di di, di-di-di-di
Di di, di-di-di-di</i>

1026
01:16:09,858 --> 01:16:12,141
My fucking back's killing me.

1027
01:16:12,141 --> 01:16:14,174
I need a crap.

1028
01:16:14,174 --> 01:16:17,278
Do you want me to go in?
I'll go.

1029
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:21,644
Excuse me.
You can't park your bus here.

1030
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:24,383
Are you planning on staying here?
I'm sorry...

1031
01:16:24,383 --> 01:16:26,790
Could you direct me to Marian Barber?

1032
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,865
We're the cabaret act from Sydney.

1033
01:16:28,865 --> 01:16:31,729
Oh, right, right!
Just go through to reception.

1034
01:16:31,729 --> 01:16:33,264
Thanks.
No worries.

1035
01:16:33,264 --> 01:16:35,660
It's alright, Lenny.
It's the drag queens!

1036
01:16:37,746 --> 01:16:41,481
Come on, Bob. Let's go try on
your new frock.

1037
01:16:41,481 --> 01:16:43,016
G'day.

1038
01:16:45,009 --> 01:16:47,084
Just over there by the bar.

1039
01:16:47,084 --> 01:16:48,618
Thanks.

1040
01:16:53,931 --> 01:16:56,795
No, those three kegs
didn't arrive.

1041
01:16:56,795 --> 01:16:59,492
I need them today -
not tomorrow, but today.

1042
01:16:59,492 --> 01:17:01,028
You're a doll.

1043
01:17:01,028 --> 01:17:02,562
What an arsehole.

1044
01:17:06,672 --> 01:17:09,120
Oh, my God! Husband! Husband!

1045
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,859
It's so good to see you!
Hiya, wife!

1046
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:15,566
You're late. Where are the others?
Oh, they're outside.

1047
01:17:15,601 --> 01:17:18,966
You've lost weight, you old queer.
About fucken time!

1048
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:22,669
I can fit into your old one-piece -
the one with the sunflowers.

1049
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:24,355
What the hell do you do with it?

1050
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,453
'The Poseidon Adventure' routine.
You know, Shelley Winters.

1051
01:17:33,481 --> 01:17:35,050
Where is he?

1052
01:17:42,154 --> 01:17:45,682
One thing I'd like to do to you
a good spanking.

1053
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:48,326
You can get it!

1054
01:17:48,361 --> 01:17:50,322
Spank, spank, spank!

1055
01:17:50,322 --> 01:17:52,640
I'll put you over my knee.

1056
01:17:52,675 --> 01:17:55,192
I'll "spank, spank" you back!
Oops!

1057
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:55,890
Benj.

1058
01:17:57,094 --> 01:17:59,806
Do you remember Tick?

1059
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:07,918
Hello, Tick.

1060
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:14,317
Hello.

1061
01:18:17,856 --> 01:18:19,516
Where's the bloody bar?

1062
01:18:23,683 --> 01:18:25,633
Mr Belrose?

1063
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:27,501
Yes?

1064
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:30,281
Congratulations. It's a boy.

1065
01:18:33,767 --> 01:18:35,337
Oh!

1066
01:18:36,382 --> 01:18:38,208
Shit!
Are you OK?

1067
01:18:37,808 --> 01:18:40,090
What's the matter? Oh, my God!
Help.

1068
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,706
Christ's sake, Mitz,
why didn't you tell us?

1069
01:18:42,741 --> 01:18:44,863
Why hell did you shock me like that?

1070
01:18:44,863 --> 01:18:46,398
Ooh!

1071
01:18:46,398 --> 01:18:49,511
This lump on my head's
growing by the second.

1072
01:18:49,511 --> 01:18:53,219
I'm about to making
my Northern Territory debut

1073
01:18:53,254 --> 01:18:56,099
looking like a fucking
Warner Bros cartoon character

1074
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:57,491
has hit me with an iron.

1075
01:18:57,491 --> 01:19:00,579
I think you look more like a Disney witch myself.
Now shut your face Felicia!

1076
01:19:00,579 --> 01:19:02,048
At least I don't look like

1077
01:19:02,048 --> 01:19:04,234
somebody's tried to open
a can of beans with my face.

1078
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:07,803
I'm sorry girls. I coludn't stand off or you 
bagging me for two weeks.

1079
01:19:07,803 --> 01:19:09,480
Anyway. What difference does it make now?

1080
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,874
About two inches to my head from one.

1081
01:19:11,874 --> 01:19:14,373
You gotta get looking him? He's got my profile.

1082
01:19:14,373 --> 01:19:15,607
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1083
01:19:15,607 --> 01:19:18,284
I hate to be practical here -
but does he know who you are?

1084
01:19:18,284 --> 01:19:21,179
Does he know what you do for living?

1085
01:19:21,179 --> 01:19:24,412
He knows his father's in
the show business cosmetics industry.

1086
01:19:24,412 --> 01:19:26,865
Oh, Lord! I don't understand.

1087
01:19:26,865 --> 01:19:28,940
You don't, so stop trying to.

1088
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:31,015
It'll be fine!
It'd better be.

1089
01:19:31,015 --> 01:19:33,700
Hello! Oh, stop wearing out
that mirror!

1090
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,704
Do you always knock before you enter?
Always. Why?

1091
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:38,100
Haven't got anything to hide,
have you?

1092
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,556
Alright, girls,
you're on in 10 minutes.

1093
01:19:41,556 --> 01:19:43,341
You've been on since birth.

1094
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:45,955
The word's out. There's a big crowd.

1095
01:19:45,955 --> 01:19:47,984
How big?
A full house.

1096
01:19:49,068 --> 01:19:51,890
Where's Benj?
Safe and sound, asleep in bed.

1097
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,919
Don't worry about a thing,
my little powder puff.

1098
01:19:54,919 --> 01:19:57,036
Can I come in?

1099
01:19:57,036 --> 01:19:58,654
Now, there's a gentleman.

1100
01:19:58,654 --> 01:20:00,518
Of course you can, Bob.

1101
01:20:01,684 --> 01:20:03,631
My Aunt Minnie in here?

1102
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:08,116
Just... wanted to wish you luck.

1103
01:20:08,116 --> 01:20:10,099
Thank you, Bob.
Thanks.

1104
01:20:11,768 --> 01:20:13,843
To make up for last time.

1105
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:16,582
Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

1106
01:20:16,582 --> 01:20:19,695
Let's get this show on the road.
You, out.

1107
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:22,008
10-minute curtain call. Good luck.

1108
01:20:25,214 --> 01:20:27,621
That's quite a wife you've got, Mitz.

1109
01:20:27,621 --> 01:20:31,522
What's doing in a spare time - sanding back
the hulls of the oil tanker with her tongue?

1110
01:20:31,522 --> 01:20:33,388
She sure is something!

1111
01:20:34,469 --> 01:20:36,087
Oh!
Chookers, girls.

1112
01:20:36,087 --> 01:20:38,245
Watch my jaw!
Mind my head.

1113
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:39,862
Aren't we faaa-bulous!

1114
01:20:40,943 --> 01:20:44,387
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lasseters Casino, Alice Springs

1115
01:20:44,387 --> 01:20:46,338
presents Miss Mitzi del Gra,

1116
01:20:46,338 --> 01:20:50,239
Miss Felicia Jolly Good Fellow
and Miss Bernadette Basinger -

1117
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,646
the Sisters of the Simpson Desert.

1118
01:21:00,191 --> 01:21:02,391
<i>Meeting Mr Right</i>

1119
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:04,466
<i>The man of my dreams</i>

1120
01:21:04,466 --> 01:21:08,616
<i>The one who showed me true love
or at least it seemed</i>

1121
01:21:08,616 --> 01:21:12,351
<i>With brown cocoa skin
and curly black hair</i>

1122
01:21:12,351 --> 01:21:16,169
<i>Just the way he looks at me -
that gentle, loving stare</i>

1123
01:21:16,169 --> 01:21:20,485
<i>Finally you came along</i>

1124
01:21:20,485 --> 01:21:24,344
<i>The way I feel about you
it just can't be wrong</i>

1125
01:21:24,344 --> 01:21:28,910
<i>If you only knew
the way I feel about you</i>

1126
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:31,666
<i>I just can't describe it</i>

1127
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:33,625
<i>Oh, no, no</i>

1128
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:36,115
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1129
01:21:36,115 --> 01:21:41,054
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1130
01:21:41,054 --> 01:21:44,083
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1131
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:48,773
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it</i>

1132
01:21:48,773 --> 01:21:52,010
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1133
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:56,782
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1134
01:21:56,782 --> 01:22:00,061
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1135
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:04,750
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it...</i>

1136
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:08,402
<i>Seemed so many times
he seemed to be the one</i>

1137
01:22:08,402 --> 01:22:12,552
<i>But all he ever wanted
was to have a little fun</i>

1138
01:22:12,552 --> 01:22:16,744
<i>But now you've come along
and brightened up my world</i>

1139
01:22:16,744 --> 01:22:20,894
<i>In my heart I feel it
I'm that special kind of girl</i>

1140
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:24,587
<i>Finally you came along</i>

1141
01:22:24,587 --> 01:22:28,571
<i>The way I feel about you
it just can't be wrong</i>

1142
01:22:28,571 --> 01:22:32,846
<i>If you only knew
the way I feel about you</i>

1143
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:35,668
<i>I just can't describe it</i>

1144
01:22:35,668 --> 01:22:37,203
<i>Oh, no, no</i>

1145
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:39,818
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1146
01:22:39,818 --> 01:22:44,507
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1147
01:22:44,507 --> 01:22:47,744
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1148
01:22:47,744 --> 01:22:52,475
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it</i>

1149
01:22:52,475 --> 01:22:55,754
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1150
01:22:55,754 --> 01:23:00,360
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1151
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,763
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1152
01:23:03,763 --> 01:23:08,370
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it...</i>

1153
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:10,234
<i>Finally</i>

1154
01:23:11,316 --> 01:23:12,976
<i>Whoa</i>

1155
01:23:12,976 --> 01:23:17,873
<i>Finally
Yeah, yeah</i>

1156
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:19,824
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

1157
01:23:19,824 --> 01:23:22,023
<i>Finally, baby</i>

1158
01:23:22,023 --> 01:23:24,223
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1159
01:23:24,223 --> 01:23:25,800
<i>Baby, yeah, yeah</i>

1160
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,750
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1161
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,659
<i>Baby, yeah, yeah</i>

1162
01:23:29,659 --> 01:23:31,817
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1163
01:23:31,817 --> 01:23:33,768
<i>Baby, yeah, yeah</i>

1164
01:23:33,768 --> 01:23:35,760
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1165
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,752
<i>Baby, yeah, yeah</i>

1166
01:23:37,752 --> 01:23:39,910
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1167
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:59,974
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1168
01:23:59,974 --> 01:24:04,663
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1169
01:24:04,663 --> 01:24:07,983
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1170
01:24:07,983 --> 01:24:12,673
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it</i>

1171
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:15,619
<i>Finally
Oh, yeah</i>

1172
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:25,206
<i>Yeah, yeah...</i>

1173
01:24:25,206 --> 01:24:28,604
<i>Finally
Oh, yeah.</i>

1174
01:24:45,688 --> 01:24:48,593
More!
Bravo!

1175
01:24:48,593 --> 01:24:50,419
Beauty!
Come on, everybody!

1176
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:51,954
Yay!
More!

1177
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:53,656
Yes! More!

1178
01:24:53,656 --> 01:24:55,191
Hey-hey!
More! More!

1179
01:24:57,666 --> 01:24:59,202
More!
You were wonderful!

1180
01:24:59,202 --> 01:25:01,650
We want more!
Yes!

1181
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:03,993
Magnificent!
Yay!

1182
01:25:03,993 --> 01:25:06,068
Bravo! Whoo!
More!

1183
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:09,054
We want more!

1184
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:12,210
Come on, snap out of it.

1185
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:13,829
Come on, mate.

1186
01:25:13,829 --> 01:25:15,480
You'll be fine.

1187
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:19,016
Come on, love.

1188
01:25:19,016 --> 01:25:20,999
Oh.
That's it, mate.

1189
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:24,162
Scared us all for a minute.

1190
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:26,818
Had to have extra attention,
didn't you?

1191
01:25:26,818 --> 01:25:28,852
Nice one, lovey, nice one.

1192
01:25:28,852 --> 01:25:30,470
Shit!

1193
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:32,213
What are you doing, Marian?

1194
01:25:32,213 --> 01:25:35,160
You liar!
You told me he been in bed.

1195
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,695
Shh! Drink your daiquiri.

1196
01:25:36,695 --> 01:25:38,314
I hate bloody daiquiri!

1197
01:25:38,314 --> 01:25:40,555
You don't.
You love bloody daiquiris.

1198
01:25:40,555 --> 01:25:44,124
Now I know why drag queens
drink from big glasses.

1199
01:25:44,124 --> 01:25:48,108
To make their hands look smaller!
Oh, ha ha, Marian!

1200
01:25:48,108 --> 01:25:51,635
What do I tell the boy?
I've never been so embarrassed.

1201
01:25:51,635 --> 01:25:53,171
You're overreacting.
Really?!

1202
01:25:53,171 --> 01:25:55,246
Yes. You're being a drama queen.

1203
01:25:55,246 --> 01:25:59,022
You'd better drop that shit
if you're gonna be a good father.

1204
01:25:59,022 --> 01:26:02,010
And don't pretend to be surprised.
It's your turn.

1205
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:04,749
Not forever -
maybe just a couple of months.

1206
01:26:04,749 --> 01:26:06,326
Yeah, but why now?

1207
01:26:06,326 --> 01:26:09,107
Because I haven't had a holiday
in eight years.

1208
01:26:09,107 --> 01:26:11,502
I need a rest, Tick. I need space.

1209
01:26:12,717 --> 01:26:15,954
Reminds me of something I said not so long ago.
Well, I do.

1210
01:26:15,954 --> 01:26:18,610
It's time he knew his father anyway.

1211
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,146
Yeah, that's the problem.

1212
01:26:20,146 --> 01:26:21,930
What do I tell him?

1213
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:24,337
What do you assume I do - lie?

1214
01:26:24,337 --> 01:26:26,786
Assumption's the mother
of all fuck-ups.

1215
01:26:26,786 --> 01:26:28,487
Don't bitch to me, bitch to him.

1216
01:26:28,487 --> 01:26:31,473
You might be surprised.
Thanks for the free advice.

1217
01:26:39,721 --> 01:26:41,505
Who is it?

1218
01:26:41,505 --> 01:26:43,240
It's me, Bob.

1219
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:49,432
Your flowers were being mangled.

1220
01:26:49,432 --> 01:26:51,827
Thought I'd rescue them for you.

1221
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,270
Good idea. Thanks.

1222
01:27:06,696 --> 01:27:08,395
What's the matter?

1223
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:11,302
Nothing.

1224
01:27:15,328 --> 01:27:18,233
Know what your father does
for a living?

1225
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,810
Yeah.

1226
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:26,035
So I supposed you know he doesn't
really like girls then?

1227
01:27:26,035 --> 01:27:28,395
Does he have a boyfriend
at the moment?

1228
01:27:29,853 --> 01:27:31,430
No.

1229
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:33,007
Neither does Mum.

1230
01:27:33,007 --> 01:27:36,111
She had a girlfriend,
but she got over her.

1231
01:27:39,979 --> 01:27:43,248
Do you complementary?
I've got Lego.

1232
01:27:44,378 --> 01:27:46,077
Sure.

1233
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,633
Come on, Butch. Get moving.

1234
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:56,123
We can't brand the cattle
by ourselves.

1235
01:27:56,123 --> 01:27:59,650
Great show last night.
You always end a number like that?

1236
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:01,432
Always.

1237
01:28:02,846 --> 01:28:06,083
How'd you like to pick her up
every night, Sundance?

1238
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:07,618
Be a pleasure.

1239
01:28:07,618 --> 01:28:10,731
That might include
tucking the lady into bed, Jeff.

1240
01:28:10,731 --> 01:28:12,432
What's the pay like, Marian?

1241
01:28:12,432 --> 01:28:14,839
He'll get himself into trouble
one day.

1242
01:28:14,839 --> 01:28:17,578
And you might just be
the lucky fellow.

1243
01:28:17,578 --> 01:28:19,155
Come on! All aboard!

1244
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:25,588
Watch it with the innuendos.

1245
01:28:25,588 --> 01:28:27,995
Give me a clear shot at this.

1246
01:28:27,995 --> 01:28:31,813
You call dressing like a Xanadu
production number a clear shot?

1247
01:28:31,813 --> 01:28:34,137
Come on, Tick! Who's kidding who?

1248
01:28:34,137 --> 01:28:36,046
He sure as shit isn't.

1249
01:28:36,046 --> 01:28:38,949
<i>Sehd a ocopy to hmy awyer</i>

1250
01:28:40,071 --> 01:28:41,889
<i>Gotta start a new life</i>

1251
01:28:43,059 --> 01:28:44,636
<i>You've been many things</i>

1252
01:28:44,636 --> 01:28:48,122
<i>But most of all
a good secretary to me...</i>

1253
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:49,658
<i>Um, wave...</i>

1254
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,774
What am I doing?
Swimming!

1255
01:28:51,774 --> 01:28:53,393
Um...

1256
01:28:53,393 --> 01:28:55,385
Murray.

1257
01:28:55,385 --> 01:28:57,294
Rock...
Murray rock...

1258
01:28:57,294 --> 01:28:59,854
River rock... Oh, Rock! Rock Hudson!

1259
01:29:00,904 --> 01:29:03,311
Silly dag!
Didn't you get Doris Day?

1260
01:29:03,311 --> 01:29:06,710
My turn! My turn!
OK, smartypants, you try.

1261
01:29:07,752 --> 01:29:09,287
Come on, then.

1262
01:29:09,287 --> 01:29:11,321
It's a...
Person.

1263
01:29:11,321 --> 01:29:12,856
A sexy woman.
Cat?

1264
01:29:12,856 --> 01:29:14,392
Famous woman.

1265
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:16,218
Um...
Oh, ah...

1266
01:29:16,218 --> 01:29:17,795
Baby.
Oh, ah, rocking.

1267
01:29:17,795 --> 01:29:19,496
Oh, I know this one.

1268
01:29:19,496 --> 01:29:22,028
Racehorse!
Cat. Scary cat.

1269
01:29:22,028 --> 01:29:23,646
Er, scary moose.

1270
01:29:23,646 --> 01:29:25,182
Scary dog?

1271
01:29:25,182 --> 01:29:26,883
I know, I know!
No?

1272
01:29:26,883 --> 01:29:29,373
Oh, Lindy Chamberlain.

1273
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:32,486
That was appalling, Benji.

1274
01:29:32,486 --> 01:29:34,561
Who taught you that?
Mum did.

1275
01:29:34,561 --> 01:29:36,636
Lies! All lies!
I thought so.

1276
01:29:36,636 --> 01:29:39,001
Come on, Adam.

1277
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:41,325
Up!

1278
01:29:41,325 --> 01:29:43,234
Time is against us.

1279
01:29:43,234 --> 01:29:45,430
And we have things to do.

1280
01:29:48,214 --> 01:29:50,289
Come on, you butch thing, you.

1281
01:29:50,289 --> 01:29:52,074
No, no, count me out.

1282
01:29:52,074 --> 01:29:54,481
All for one...
Come on, Tick.

1283
01:29:54,481 --> 01:29:56,051
No.

1284
01:29:58,044 --> 01:29:59,704
Hmm.

1285
01:29:59,704 --> 01:30:02,265
Come on, Adam. Let's get frocked.

1286
01:30:09,042 --> 01:30:10,743
So, uh...

1287
01:30:10,743 --> 01:30:14,686
...er, what's it like
to finally have a father?

1288
01:30:14,686 --> 01:30:16,385
It's OK.

1289
01:30:21,201 --> 01:30:23,152
I'm sorry about last night.

1290
01:30:23,152 --> 01:30:26,015
I don't always dress up
in women's clothes.

1291
01:30:26,015 --> 01:30:29,120
I mean, you know,
don't get the wrong idea.

1292
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:31,908
Um...

1293
01:30:31,908 --> 01:30:34,398
I do a lot of different stuff.

1294
01:30:34,398 --> 01:30:39,461
You know,
like... EIvis and Gary Glitter.

1295
01:30:39,461 --> 01:30:41,031
Abba?

1296
01:30:44,068 --> 01:30:47,180
I'm not supposed to know
about the Abba show.

1297
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:49,670
But I'd really like to see it.

1298
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,866
Would you do Abba for me?

1299
01:30:53,364 --> 01:30:55,063
Sure.

1300
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:02,903
You know what I am, don't you?

1301
01:31:03,988 --> 01:31:06,679
Mum says you're the best
in the business.

1302
01:31:08,055 --> 01:31:11,702
Ah, well, your mother was always
prone to exaggeration.

1303
01:31:14,861 --> 01:31:17,965
Will you have a boyfriend
when we're in Sydney?

1304
01:31:22,289 --> 01:31:23,859
Maybe.

1305
01:31:25,692 --> 01:31:27,352
That's good.

1306
01:31:39,139 --> 01:31:41,546
Come on!
Where are we going?

1307
01:31:41,546 --> 01:31:44,024
To unleash the best in the business.

1308
01:31:51,713 --> 01:31:53,448
I had a dream.

1309
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:33,898
Well...

1310
01:33:33,898 --> 01:33:35,880
...we did it.

1311
01:33:37,176 --> 01:33:39,334
It never ends, does it?

1312
01:33:39,334 --> 01:33:41,034
All that space.

1313
01:33:46,682 --> 01:33:48,464
So, what now?

1314
01:33:49,504 --> 01:33:51,982
I think I want to go home.

1315
01:33:54,027 --> 01:33:55,679
Me too.

1316
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,924
Well, then...

1317
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:02,689
...let's finish the shows
and go home.

1318
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:19,550
Don't go without leaving me
your number, Sunshine.

1319
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:21,085
Already taken care of, Jeff.

1320
01:34:21,085 --> 01:34:23,700
It's at the bar end
of the men's cubicle -

1321
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,443
"For a good time, phone Felicia."

1322
01:34:25,443 --> 01:34:28,480
Can we stop at McDonald's?
Good idea.

1323
01:34:28,515 --> 01:34:30,680
I've had enough of this shitty food.
Fucking crayfish.

1324
01:34:30,715 --> 01:34:32,581
Where the hell do you start?

1325
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:34,427
Lay it on the line, husband.

1326
01:34:34,427 --> 01:34:36,028
Don't conceal anything -
that's the key.

1327
01:34:36,028 --> 01:34:39,240
If he doesn't like it, stiff
bickies, he can always come back.

1328
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,764
What happens when people
hear about Mitzi's minor?

1329
01:34:41,764 --> 01:34:43,185
That's your problem, not his.

1330
01:34:43,185 --> 01:34:48,019
Morals are a choice. He'll decide
his own when he's ready.

1331
01:34:48,019 --> 01:34:50,509
Well, that's it. You're all packed.

1332
01:34:50,509 --> 01:34:54,161
You're joking?! Bernadette's shoes
aren't on board yet.

1333
01:34:54,161 --> 01:34:57,066
Hate to say this -
wish I was going with you.

1334
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:59,141
Your gas tank will be fine.

1335
01:34:59,141 --> 01:35:01,216
Your axle... may be another matter.

1336
01:35:01,216 --> 01:35:03,913
The road will be filled
with bored mechanics

1337
01:35:03,913 --> 01:35:06,901
hoping some drag queens
will spirit them away.

1338
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:09,308
We won't spirit gum at this rate.

1339
01:35:09,308 --> 01:35:11,586
Where the hell's Bernadette?
Here.

1340
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:16,322
Come on, cabanossi tits.
Where are your bags?

1341
01:35:16,322 --> 01:35:17,938
In my room.

1342
01:35:19,891 --> 01:35:23,086
I'm not going.
I'm staying here for a while.

1343
01:35:23,086 --> 01:35:26,946
Oh, really? And you're choosing
to tell us about this now?

1344
01:35:26,946 --> 01:35:29,478
She told me a few weeks back.

1345
01:35:29,478 --> 01:35:32,922
Somebody's got to handle the guest
entertainment while I'm away.

1346
01:35:32,922 --> 01:35:36,109
I get it.
Who's been playing hide the sausage?

1347
01:35:38,276 --> 01:35:40,392
Let's go before I throw up.

1348
01:35:40,392 --> 01:35:41,969
Come on, Benj.

1349
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:43,754
Hope you can drive.

1350
01:35:43,754 --> 01:35:45,497
Hey, not without a hug!

1351
01:35:45,497 --> 01:35:47,279
Waaaa!
Waaaa!

1352
01:35:50,767 --> 01:35:52,502
Are you sure?

1353
01:35:53,589 --> 01:35:55,241
No, I'm not sure.

1354
01:35:57,075 --> 01:36:00,179
I'll never know
unless I give it a shot.

1355
01:36:15,377 --> 01:36:17,489
I'm as jealous as all hell.

1356
01:36:19,568 --> 01:36:22,755
Shit! Raccoon time again.

1357
01:36:26,923 --> 01:36:29,289
Don't forget to write!
See ya!

1358
01:36:29,289 --> 01:36:30,824
Wish I was staying.

1359
01:36:30,824 --> 01:36:33,231
'Bye!
'Bye! Take care of her now!

1360
01:36:33,231 --> 01:36:34,891
'Bye, Mum. 'Bye, Ralph!

1361
01:36:34,891 --> 01:36:36,925
Yeah, see ya, Ralph!

1362
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:44,102
<i>I've been cheated by you
since I don't know when</i>

1363
01:36:46,345 --> 01:36:51,361
<i>So I've made up my mind
it must come to an end</i>

1364
01:36:53,898 --> 01:36:57,550
<i>Look at me now
Will I ever learn?</i>

1365
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:59,376
<i>I don't know how</i>

1366
01:36:59,376 --> 01:37:02,738
<i>But I suddenly lose control</i>

1367
01:37:02,738 --> 01:37:06,055
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

1368
01:37:07,095 --> 01:37:10,498
<i>Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring</i>

1369
01:37:10,498 --> 01:37:13,818
<i>One more look
and I forget everything</i>

1370
01:37:13,818 --> 01:37:15,520
<i>Whoa</i>

1371
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,632
<i>Mama mia
Here I go again</i>

1372
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:22,326
<i>My, my, how can I resist you?</i>

1373
01:37:22,326 --> 01:37:25,604
<i>Mama mia
Does it show again</i>

1374
01:37:25,604 --> 01:37:29,007
<i>My, my, just how much I missed you?</i>

1375
01:37:29,007 --> 01:37:32,410
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

1376
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:35,855
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

1377
01:37:35,855 --> 01:37:39,673
<i>Why, why
did I ever let you go?</i>

1378
01:37:39,673 --> 01:37:43,076
<i>Mama mia
Now I really know</i>

1379
01:37:43,076 --> 01:37:46,510
<i>My, my,
I could never let you go...</i>

1380
01:37:53,575 --> 01:37:57,340
<i>I've been angry and sad
about things that you do</i>

1381
01:38:00,547 --> 01:38:04,690
<i>I can't count all the times
that I told you we're through</i>

1382
01:38:07,353 --> 01:38:11,005
<i>How can you go
when you slam the door?</i>

1383
01:38:11,005 --> 01:38:16,027
<i>I think you know
that you won't be away too long</i>

1384
01:38:16,027 --> 01:38:20,218
<i>You know that I'm not that strong</i>

1385
01:38:20,218 --> 01:38:23,704
<i>Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring</i>

1386
01:38:23,704 --> 01:38:27,273
<i>One more look
and I forget everything</i>

1387
01:38:27,273 --> 01:38:28,809
<i>Whoa</i>

1388
01:38:28,809 --> 01:38:32,129
<i>Mama mia
Here I go again</i>

1389
01:38:32,129 --> 01:38:35,490
<i>My, my, how can I resist you?</i>

1390
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:39,018
<i>Mama mia
Does it show again</i>

1391
01:38:39,018 --> 01:38:42,379
<i>My, my,
just how much I missed you?</i>

1392
01:38:42,379 --> 01:38:45,865
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

1393
01:38:45,865 --> 01:38:49,185
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

1394
01:38:49,185 --> 01:38:52,962
<i>Why, why
did I ever let you go?</i>

1395
01:38:52,962 --> 01:38:56,323
<i>Mama mia
Now I really know</i>

1396
01:38:56,323 --> 01:38:59,970
<i>Why, why
I could never let you go.</i>

1397
01:39:18,401 --> 01:39:20,186
No, that's enough.

1398
01:39:20,186 --> 01:39:22,261
Oh, my tits are falling down!

1399
01:39:23,838 --> 01:39:26,324
Oh, Jesus!

1400
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:27,615
Thank you!

1401
01:39:27,615 --> 01:39:30,063
Thank you. It's good to be home!

1402
01:39:49,023 --> 01:39:53,988
<i>Sometimes the snow
comes down in June</i>

1403
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:59,010
<i>Sometimes the sun
goes round the moon</i>

1404
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:03,948
<i>I see the passion in your eyes</i>

1405
01:40:03,948 --> 01:40:08,970
<i>Sometimes it's all a big surprise</i>

1406
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:14,489
<i>'Cause there was a time
when all I did was wish</i>

1407
01:40:14,489 --> 01:40:18,764
<i>You'd tell me this was love</i>

1408
01:40:18,764 --> 01:40:24,698
<i>It's not the way I hoped
or how I planned</i>

1409
01:40:24,698 --> 01:40:28,890
<i>But somehow it's enough</i>

1410
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:34,036
<i>And now we're standing face to face</i>

1411
01:40:34,036 --> 01:40:38,684
<i>Isn't this world a crazy place?</i>

1412
01:40:38,684 --> 01:40:43,705
<i>Just when I thought
our chance had passed</i>

1413
01:40:43,705 --> 01:40:50,386
<i>You go and save the best for last</i>

1414
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:00,845
<i>All of the nights you came to me</i>

1415
01:41:00,845 --> 01:41:05,742
<i>When some silly girl
had set you free</i>

1416
01:41:05,742 --> 01:41:10,763
<i>You wondered
how you'd make it through</i>

1417
01:41:10,763 --> 01:41:16,117
<i>I wondered what was wrong with you</i>

1418
01:41:16,117 --> 01:41:21,885
<i>'Cause how could you give your love
to someone else</i>

1419
01:41:21,885 --> 01:41:25,869
<i>And share your dreams with me?</i>

1420
01:41:25,869 --> 01:41:31,845
<i>Sometimes the very thing
you're looking for</i>

1421
01:41:31,845 --> 01:41:36,078
<i>Is the one thing you can't see</i>

1422
01:41:36,078 --> 01:41:40,851
<i>But now we're standing face to face</i>

1423
01:41:40,851 --> 01:41:46,080
<i>Isn't this world a crazy place?</i>

1424
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:50,811
<i>Just when I thought
our chance had passed</i>

1425
01:41:50,811 --> 01:41:57,315
<i>You go and save the best for last</i>

1426
01:42:01,144 --> 01:42:06,041
<i>Sometimes the snow
comes down in June</i>

1427
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:10,689
<i>Sometimes the sun
goes round the moon</i>

1428
01:42:10,689 --> 01:42:15,586
<i>Just when I thought
our chance had passed</i>

1429
01:42:15,586 --> 01:42:22,385
<i>You go and save the best for last</i>

1430
01:42:26,169 --> 01:42:29,651
<i>You went and saved the best...</i>

1431
01:42:31,024 --> 01:42:35,746
<i>...for last</i>

1432
01:42:36,876 --> 01:42:41,019
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
