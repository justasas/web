1
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:38,798
<i>Hey, lady, you, lady</i>

2
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:41,631
<i>Cursin' at your life</i>

3
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:45,270
<i>You're a discontented mother</i>

4
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,591
<i>And a regimented wife</i>

5
00:00:50,127 --> 00:00:53,836
<i>I've no doubt you dream about</i>

6
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:57,597
<i>The things you never do</i>

7
00:00:57,597 --> 00:01:01,445
<i>But I wish someone
had've talked to me</i>

8
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:05,094
<i>Like I wanna talk to you</i>

9
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:09,685
<i>Ooh, I've been to Georgia
and California</i>

10
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:13,286
<i>And anywhere I could run</i>

11
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:17,046
<i>Took the hand of a preacher man</i>

12
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:20,578
<i>And we made love in the sun</i>

13
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:25,474
<i>But I ran out of places
and friendly faces</i>

14
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:28,638
<i>Because I had to be free</i>

15
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:32,993
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

16
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:37,378
<i>But I've never been to me</i>

17
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:43,919
<i>Please, lady
Please, lady</i>

18
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,969
<i>Don't just walk away</i>

19
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:49,966
<i>'Cause I have this need to tell you</i>

20
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:54,514
<i>Why I'm all alone today</i>

21
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,709
<i>I can see so much of me</i>

22
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,148
<i>Still living in your eyes</i>

23
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:06,562
<i>Won't you share a part
of a weary heart</i>

24
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:10,138
<i>That has lived a million lies?</i>

25
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:14,397
<i>Oh, I've been to Nice
and the isle of Greece</i>

26
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:17,836
<i>While I sipped champagne
on a yacht</i>

27
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:22,491
<i>I've moved like Harlow
in Monte Carlo</i>

28
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:25,149
<i>And showed 'em what I've got</i>

29
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:28,330
<i>I've been undressed by kings</i>

30
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,363
<i>And I've seen some things</i>

31
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:34,579
<i>That a woman ain't s'posed to see</i>

32
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:40,707
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

33
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:45,416
<i>But I've never been</i>

34
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,301
<i>To me</i>

35
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:52,923
<i>Ooooh</i>

36
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:57,712
<i>I've been to paradise...</i>

37
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:00,832
<i>Never been to me.
More! More!</i>

38
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,753
More!

39
00:03:02,753 --> 00:03:05,793
Oh, please!

40
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:08,154
Next!
Put it away, sweetie!

41
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:14,947
Ugh!

42
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:18,585
Are you OK?
Yeah.

43
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:24,186
That was fuckin' charming,
you gutless pack of dickheads.

44
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:26,826
Fuck off, you talentless dog!
What was that?

45
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,827
Show us your pink bits!
No!

46
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:31,467
Know why this microphone
has such a long cord?

47
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:35,751
So it's easily retrieved
after I've shoved it up YOUR arse.

48
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,308
Christ almighty!

49
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:50,151
What the fuck's
going on out there tonight?

50
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:52,671
Are you hurt?

51
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:56,979
Alright, which one of you bitches
sat on my dress?

52
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,464
Tick, darling, it's for you.

53
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,754
Hello.
Ding dong, Avon calling.

54
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,746
Howdy, sunshine. Long time no hear.

55
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:11,288
Where?
Emergency ward A.

56
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,824
Mr Belrose?

57
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,213
Yes?

58
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:23,688
So... how about it?

59
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:31,183
Leave him alone!
Fuck off!

60
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:34,754
Get... get off him!

61
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:39,266
Taxi! Taxi!

62
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:50,399
Yeah?

63
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,899
Bernadette? It's Tick.

64
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:55,885
Sorry to call you so late, but I...

65
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:58,374
Hey, are you OK?

66
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,294
No, I'm not.

67
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,218
Well... what's the matter?

68
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:04,902
Trumpet just died.

69
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:15,424
"...and established it on the floods."

70
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,811
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

71
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:22,442
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

72
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,366
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

73
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,486
"He restoreth my soul.

74
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:29,126
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness..."

75
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:30,727
"...for his name's sake.

76
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:34,527
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

77
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:37,164
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

78
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:39,593
"Thy rod and staff comfort me.

79
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:43,257
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

80
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:47,369
"Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

81
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:51,735
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all my life,

82
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:55,084
"and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

83
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,611
It's not fair.

84
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:01,611
I spent half my life
and all my savings

85
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,430
trying to snag
a sympathetic husband.

86
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,062
And the selfish little shit
goes and dies on me.

87
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:12,744
25 years old, and he goes
and slips over in a bathroom.

88
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,271
He didn't slip.

89
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:18,769
He was peroxiding his hair at home
and he asphyxiated on the fumes.

90
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:23,146
I need some space.

91
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:26,550
I've, um... been asked to do a show
out of town.

92
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,046
That's nice.
Well, why don't you come with me?

93
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:32,798
I'll need some help, and...
we could both use the break.

94
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:34,763
You're not wrong. Where is it?

95
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:37,035
Um... Alice Springs.

96
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:40,656
You've got to be fucking joking!

97
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:48,023
Wo-Man is a... unique range
of speciality facial products

98
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:53,749
designed for the more...
heavy-duty woman in us all.

99
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:57,596
Now, um... this week...

100
00:06:57,596 --> 00:06:59,303
Excuse me.

101
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,076
Um... hello?

102
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,416
How long is the run?

103
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:06,981
Four weeks.

104
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,381
Equity minimum, two shows a night,
accommodation included.

105
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:15,342
I can't just sit around here
crying all the time.

106
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:19,428
Jesus! My mascara keeps running.
I look like a raccoon.

107
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:22,063
Good girl!
That's the spirit.

108
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:25,904
Here's hoping the desert's
big enough for the two of us.

109
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,624
Um... three of us.

110
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:30,224
<i>A desert holiday</i>

111
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,784
<i>Let's pack the drag away</i>

112
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:36,031
<i>You take the lunch and tea
I'll take the ecstasy</i>

113
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:38,268
<i>Fuck off, you silly queer</i>

114
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:39,791
<i>I'm getting out of here</i>

115
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:43,137
<i>A desert holiday
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray.</i>

116
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:48,488
Why?

117
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:50,284
Why not?

118
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,468
Look, he's turned into
a bloody good little performer.

119
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:54,948
That's right.

120
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:56,588
A bloody good little performer.

121
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:59,228
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

122
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,549
I thought we were escaping
this shit.

123
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:04,269
Two's company, three's a party,
Bernadette my sweet.

124
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:09,481
We're unplugging our curling wands
and going bush, Felicia.

125
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:11,764
Why would you possibly
leave all this glamour

126
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,150
for a hike into nowhere?

127
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,638
You really want to know?
Desperately.

128
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:20,765
Well, ever since I was a lad
I've had this dream -

129
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,574
a dream that I now, finally,
have a chance to fulfil.

130
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:27,063
And that is...?

131
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:29,297
To travel to the centre
of Australia,

132
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:32,261
climb Kings Canyon - as a queen -

133
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:37,115
in a full-length Gaultier sequin,
heels and a tiara.

134
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,890
Great. That's just what
this country needs.

135
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:43,930
A cock in a frock on a rock.

136
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:46,942
Get back in your kennels,
both of you.

137
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:50,305
Now, the first thing
we have to work out...

138
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,657
...is how the hell we get there.

139
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:08,353
Ta-da!

140
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,012
What do you think?

141
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:14,124
When do we have to
return it to the school?

142
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,741
We don't. We own it.

143
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,317
What?!

144
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:23,754
Well, I met some nice 'Svedish'
tourists called Lars, Lars and Lars

145
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:26,634
and I coaxed it out of them
for $10,000.

146
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,244
We can't afford it.
Well, that's right.

147
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:32,767
"Mummy,
maybe a trip to the outback

148
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:35,979
"would help me get over this little
'phase' I'm going through.

149
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:39,536
"And you never know - I might meet
some lovely country girl."

150
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:44,175
I hereby christen
this budget Barbie camper...

151
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,794
...Priscilla -

152
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,493
Queen of the Desert.

153
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,710
That's got to be the understatement
of the century.

154
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,693
Mum!

155
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:21,032
Ladies and gentlemen!

156
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:24,478
We're here today to see off
a very brave woman

157
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:27,217
who will attempt to cross
a continent alone.

158
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:29,293
On behalf of all her sponsors...

159
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,891
Ladies...

160
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:49,631
...start your engines.

161
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:22,279
<i>This old man
He played two</i>

162
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,540
<i>He played knick-knack
with my poo...</i>

163
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,298
<i>Please!
Knick-knack paddy-whack...</i>

164
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,185
<i>Give me a break!
This old man came rolling home.</i>

165
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:32,714
<i>Four fat trannies
working on the wall</i>

166
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:36,158
<i>And if one fat trannie
should accidentally fall...</i>

167
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:41,077
<i>My darling Clementine</i>

168
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:44,018
<i>Da da da da...</i>

169
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,863
How long have we been on the road?

170
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:52,302
4 and a half hours.

171
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,654
I've got
a splitting headache already.

172
00:11:57,576 --> 00:12:01,293
Happy hour!
Mother's ruin pour moi.

173
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:05,352
Long Island tea...
And a Stoli and tonic for me.

174
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:11,088
Stupid cow.
Well, listen to this one.

175
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:12,586
After we did the Abba show,

176
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:15,657
Kevin had one of those liposuction
penis enlargements.

177
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:16,794
He didn't?
Yep.

178
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:18,734
Know what they do?

179
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,931
They siphon fat
from your love handles

180
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:23,566
and inject it into your wing-wang.

181
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:24,589
Ugh! Yucky!

182
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:27,336
It gives a new meaning
to "cracking a fat", though.

183
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:30,407
Baaa-aaaa! Baaa-aaaa!

184
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:36,101
Listen to yourselves! You sound like
two fat slags at a pie bake-off.

185
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:38,301
Well, your contribution
to the conversation

186
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:40,398
hasn't exactly
made headlines, Bernice.

187
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:43,423
Gee, poor Kevin's dick.

188
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,500
There can't be much room down there

189
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:47,924
with his brain taking up
so much space already.

190
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:51,294
No, I'll join this conversation

191
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:54,823
on the proviso that we stop
bitching about people,

192
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:57,811
talking about wigs,
dresses, bust sizes,

193
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,843
penises, drugs, nightclubs
and bloody Abba!

194
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:05,063
Doesn't give us much
to talk about then, does it?

195
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:08,996
Hey, can you confirm
a rumour for me?

196
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:13,945
Is it true her real name's Ralph?
Shh!

197
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:19,671
How do you like
your little boys, girls?

198
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,524
You don't have to answer that.

199
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:30,505
Oh, my God. What is this -
'Outback with Benny Hill'?

200
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:33,618
Just leave mine outside the door
at about 8am

201
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:36,482
along with an orange juice
and toast, please.

202
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,391
Why, certainly, madam.

203
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:41,130
Would you like
vegemite or jam with that?

204
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,315
Er... knock knock. Room service.

205
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:50,054
Can't you read the sign -
"Do not disturb"?

206
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:53,206
Come back in the morning.
Ha ha. Open the door.

207
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:57,227
Goodnight, Bernice.
Goodnight, Mitzi.

208
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,016
Open the fucking door!

209
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:07,860
OK, if you don't open the door...
I'm gonna sing.

210
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:12,757
Fine. You asked for it.

211
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:16,211
<i>I don't care
if the sun don't shine</i>

212
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:18,128
<i>I get my loving
in the evening time</i>

213
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,135
<i>When I'm with my baby</i>

214
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,032
<i>It's no fun with the sun around</i>

215
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,188
<i>'Cause I get going
when the sun goes down</i>

216
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,907
<i>And I meet my baby...</i>

217
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,100
<i>That's when we kiss
and kiss and kiss</i>

218
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,175
<i>And then we kiss some more</i>

219
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,582
<i>Don't ask how many times...
Night, John-boy.</i>

220
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:40,649
Waaah!

221
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,871
I'm seriously falling asleep.

222
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:49,457
It's your shift
and you're sticking to it.

223
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:52,113
Serves you right
for staying out all night... slut.

224
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:53,815
Well, I won't make it.

225
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:56,555
<i>I don't care
if the sun don't...</i>

226
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:58,090
Oh, fuck off, grandma.

227
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,999
You alright?

228
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,075
Me? Yeah. I'm fine.

229
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:04,524
I'm just thinking.

230
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:38,853
Sorry.

231
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,331
Shit!

232
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,828
What is it?

233
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:00,439
Perhaps we should've flown.

234
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,567
Bzzt! Wrong! But thanks for playing.

235
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,102
Anyone else?
No!

236
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:24,552
Witchetty grub. Your turn.

237
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:28,453
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with 'R'.

238
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,612
Rectum.
No.

239
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:32,645
Ring pirate.
No.

240
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:34,181
Road.

241
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:37,046
Alright, that's it.
What's the matter with you?

242
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:39,875
Nothing, darling.
Don't 'darling' me, darling.

243
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,007
Look at you.
You've got a face like a cat's arse.

244
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,144
Now 'fess up.
Just... worried about the show.

245
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,760
We haven't done
any rehearsals yet...

246
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:50,956
We've got two weeks!
There's plenty of time to rehearse.

247
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:52,429
Now, what is your problem?

248
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:54,345
Not a problem. I just...

249
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,227
I just want this show to be good.
That's all. Gonna be good.

250
00:16:57,262 --> 00:16:59,842
How the fuck
did you get this job, Mitzi, my Darling?

251
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:03,993
Who is the fish that runs this bloody hotel
in the middle of nowhere, anyway?

252
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:06,068
Your mother?
No, my wife.

253
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,820
Ooh, don't tell me
you've got an ex-boyfriend

254
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:11,279
tucked away out here somewhere.

255
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:12,741
No, my WIFE!

256
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:15,406
I'm married.

257
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:31,620
And when the joint bank account
ran dry after a couple of years...

258
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:36,316
...I guess I preferred her wedding
ring to mine, so... no drama.

259
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:38,724
We swapped and called it a day.

260
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,663
This is getting too weird.

261
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,774
YOU and a woman.

262
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:48,021
What did she do for kicks?

263
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:51,185
Put a bucket on your head
and swing off the handle?

264
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:55,074
You know, there are two things
I don't like about you, Felicia.

265
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:58,502
Your face! So how about shutting
both of them?

266
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:02,090
Well, at least this explains
your abysmal batting average, Mitz.

267
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,111
I often wondered
why your dance card was so empty.

268
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:06,855
You never got a divorce, then?

269
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,846
Well, girls, what can I say?

270
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:14,419
Here's to a secret very well kept.

271
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,158
Shame it won't stay that way,
isn't it?

272
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:22,208
Mmm! Got any more little surprises
you'd like to share with us?

273
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:25,700
Haven't got any kids
stashed away out there, have you?

274
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,727
Look...

275
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:34,298
...I haven't lied about anything.

276
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:39,971
After six years I get phone call
out of nowhere, screaming for help,

277
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:42,786
and Christ knows
I owe her some favours.

278
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:49,186
I'm sorry that I never told you.

279
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:52,838
I'm not sorry
that you're here.

280
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:02,278
Don't worry about it, dolls.

281
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:04,133
I'm as jealous as all hell.

282
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,310
What?

283
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:19,913
So, was it a big wedding?

284
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,654
Get lots of pressies, did you?

285
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:25,774
I wish I was OLD enough
to have been there.

286
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,120
Oh, ha ha.

287
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:27,730
I would've bought you

288
00:19:27,926 --> 00:19:31,410
a lovely matching set
of hers and hers bathmats.

289
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:34,381
Oh, give it a rest.
Not on your life!

290
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:39,175
Oh, imagine! Mitzi the magnificent
and her blushing bride.

291
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,162
Mowing those lawns must've been
murder on your heels, though.

292
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:45,233
Alright, Felicia. That's enough.

293
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,492
Let's put some money in that seething
cesspool mouth of yours.

294
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:49,816
If I win this game,

295
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:54,026
you will NEVER mention my wife EVER
in my presence again, OK?

296
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,965
And if I win?
Name your price.

297
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,445
Well, now...

298
00:19:58,445 --> 00:20:00,174
What would I like

299
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:03,222
more than anything else
in the whole wide world?

300
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:04,945
Snap!

301
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,240
Better be quick.

302
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:25,850
What the fuck am I doing?

303
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,681
Take that bloody frock off, Felicia -
don't make it worse than it is.

304
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:33,779
You think I'm gonna let YOU get
all the attention? No chance!

305
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,470
Come on, girls. Let's go shopping.

306
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,838
Oh, for Christ's sake!

307
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,449
<i>I love the night-life
I've got to boogie</i>

308
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:48,140
<i>On the disco
Ah-ha, oh, yeah</i>

309
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,377
<i>Oh, I love the night-life</i>

310
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,452
<i>I've got to boogie</i>

311
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,595
<i>On the disco
Ah-ha, oh, yeah...</i>

312
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,041
Oh, I just adore these hats!

313
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,481
<i>Please don't talk
about love tonight</i>

314
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:07,881
<i>Your sweet talking
won't make it right</i>

315
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:11,922
<i>Loving lies
just bring me down</i>

316
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:15,617
<i>When you've got women
all over town</i>

317
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:17,692
<i>You can love them all</i>

318
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:19,435
<i>And when you're through</i>

319
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:21,137
<i>Maybe they'll make...</i>

320
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:23,959
You've got to be kidding!

321
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,579
Welcome to Mario Palace!

322
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:28,315
Come in. Come in.

323
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:30,932
Come in.

324
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:33,007
What can I do for you?

325
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,708
You'd like a room, madam?

326
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:49,984
Subtle.

327
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:51,851
Oh, tackarama!

328
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,217
Who does all the painting
around here?

329
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:58,119
Someone with no arms or right foot,
by the look of things.

330
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,492
Ugh, for goodness sakes
get down off that crucifix!

331
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:03,224
Someone needs the wood.

332
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:06,210
What have we here?!

333
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:11,761
What fun! Baby bottles of booze!

334
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:12,846
Oh!

335
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:16,699
Gather round, girls -
let me show you a trick.

336
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,162
You, um, drink the gin...

337
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,143
Ah!

338
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:28,114
...ah, fill the bottle with water
and... put it back in the fridge.

339
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:29,954
Va-t'en vous.
What about the Scotch?

340
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:34,008
Ah... that's where the complimentary
tea bags come in handy.

341
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:36,032
Very clever.
Cheers, girls.

342
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:38,958
And congratulations, Mitzi darling.
You did it.

343
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:42,024
One lap of the Broken Hill main drag
IN drag.

344
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,752
That'll teach you to take on

345
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:45,839
the Fairmont Boys School
snap champion.

346
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:48,760
Here's to being off the fucking bus.

347
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:50,393
Chookers.

348
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:52,496
Chookers.
Chookers.

349
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,260
So... all dolled up
and nowhere to go.

350
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:02,119
I sure as shit am not going to sit
in here all evening.

351
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:03,079
I'm in!

352
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,624
Oh, alright.

353
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:12,216
Here's hoping they have
a decent cocktail bar.

354
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:33,334
Hello.

355
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,158
Could I please have
a Stoli and tonic,

356
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:40,573
a Bloody Mary
and a Lime Daiquiri, please?

357
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:42,831
Well!

358
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:46,623
Look what the cat dragged in!

359
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:50,688
What have we got here, eh?

360
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:54,432
A couple of showgirls, have we?

361
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:58,225
Where did you ladies come in from?

362
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,561
Uranus?

363
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:03,518
Could I please have a Stol...
No!

364
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:05,377
Ya can't have!

365
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:07,292
Ya can't have nothin'.

366
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:11,173
We've got nothin' here
for people like you. Nothin'!

367
00:24:20,153 --> 00:24:22,477
Now listen here, you mullet.

368
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:26,960
Why don't you just light your tampon
and blow your box apart?

369
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,642
Because it's the only bang
you'll ever get, sweetheart!

370
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:50,950
<i>I get my loving
in the evening time</i>

371
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,056
<i>When I'm with my baby</i>

372
00:24:56,056 --> 00:24:58,339
<i>Oh, it's no fun...</i>

373
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:01,854
What could be
more soothing

374
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:08,332
than coming home after
a hard day's work down the mine

375
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:11,963
to the wo-man in us all?

376
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:15,925
Now, don't send any money. OK?

377
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,092
Ooh!

378
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:25,105
Ooh!

379
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,347
Ooh!

380
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,677
Oooooh!

381
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,988
OOOOH!

382
00:26:02,504 --> 00:26:04,368
Shit!

383
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:09,501
All I can see
is female impersonators.

384
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:18,119
This has got to be a first.

385
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:20,867
Nobody's ever outdrunk
old Shirl before.

386
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:23,889
Where'd you learn
to throw 'em back like that?

387
00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:25,283
That's our girl, Bernadette.

388
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:29,905
Stumbling around the pub circuit
with Les Girls for 200 years

389
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:31,122
must've taught her something.

390
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,771
You're a bloody marvel,
Bernie.

391
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:36,277
Bernadette, please.
What's that?

392
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:40,062
My name isn't Bernie.
She said her name isn't Bernie.

393
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:44,940
It's Ralph!

394
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:48,457
Come on! Oh!

395
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:51,608
Oh! Oh!

396
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:58,247
What did you call me?
"What did you call me" what?

397
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:01,558
What did you call me
back there in the bar?

398
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:03,735
Sorry... Ralph!

399
00:27:04,902 --> 00:27:08,027
You fucking idiot! Oh!

400
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:09,864
Oh! Fuck!

401
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:13,069
Oh! Fuckin'... Oh! Fuck!

402
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:15,211
Get off me, you fuckin'... Oh! Fuck!

403
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:19,343
Don't worry.
It's only my fucken head!

404
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:21,840
At least the bump on your head's
bigger than your prick!

405
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,200
Why don't you ust get fucked,
you stupid old fist?!

406
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,215
Oh, piss off, you little faggot!

407
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,187
Listen, you're so bloody boring...

408
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:29,845
If your mouth was as big
as your dick...

409
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:53,037
Good morning.
Morning.

410
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:55,942
It's funny, you know.

411
00:27:55,942 --> 00:28:00,755
No matter how tough
I think I'm getting...

412
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:04,566
...it still hurts.

413
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:09,164
Hope it still works.

414
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:11,488
Don't have much call for it here.

415
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:13,521
Where are you blokes from?

416
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:16,952
Uranus.
Oh, good.

417
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,649
There! Left!

418
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:31,181
I hope you know what you're doing.

419
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:36,231
If we stick to the sealed road
we'll be at it for at least another two days.

420
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:41,792
Take the short cut.

421
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:38,170
One more push,
I'm gonna smack his face so hard

422
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:41,819
he'll have to stick his toothbrush
up his arse to clean his teeth.

423
00:29:44,185 --> 00:29:46,463
Just lay off!

424
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:50,176
I told you not to use the 'R' word.
What did you go and do?

425
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:52,637
I was only having fun.
Fun?

426
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:55,092
What else do you do for amusement -
slam your fingers in car doors?

427
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:57,260
What's the point?

428
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,206
I like seeing people get hot-headed. Okay?
It gives me a kick

429
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:04,523
Is it true when you were born
the doctor turned around and slapped your mother?

430
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:09,026
What sort of... bent childhood
did you have, Adam Whitely?

431
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:11,990
Adam! Adam!

432
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:16,391
Come in here, boy.

433
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:19,789
Come and sit over here.

434
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:26,521
Would you like
to have some fun with Uncle Barry?

435
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:28,804
We're gonna play a SPECIAL game,

436
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:31,170
but you can't tell anybody

437
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,154
ever, ever, ever, OK?

438
00:30:35,154 --> 00:30:38,932
Now, I want you
to put your hand down here

439
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:41,788
and pull very gently, OK?

440
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,111
Very gently.

441
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:50,760
That's good. That's good.

442
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,625
Ooh!

443
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,613
Jesus Christ, Adam!
Get help!

444
00:30:56,613 --> 00:31:00,847
Adam, Uncle Barry's penie-pie
is caught in the drain.

445
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,880
Get Mummy. Get Mummy!

446
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,243
No!
Whaddya mean 'No'?!

447
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:09,099
Never, ever, ever!

448
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:13,423
You know the best part?

449
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,517
Mum was out playing golf

450
00:31:15,552 --> 00:31:19,790
and the dirty old fuck
was stuck there for seven hours!

451
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,072
I thought they were
small and wrinkled

452
00:31:22,107 --> 00:31:24,396
BEFORE they got in the water!

453
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,425
Hey, I've got a joke.

454
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:36,491
Who wants to hear a joke?

455
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:40,224
Come on, Bernice, it's so funny,

456
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,004
you'll laugh SO hard,
your lashes will curl by themselves.

457
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,816
Do tell us your hilarious joke.

458
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:47,196
OK.

459
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:50,398
Well, once upon a time,
many moons ago,

460
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:53,973
there was a famous bunch of Indians
called the Fuck-are-we tribe.

461
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:58,545
One day, the son of the great
Indian chief says to his father,

462
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,445
"Dad, why is my friend Little Hawk
called Little Hawk?"

463
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,013
And his father says...

464
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:06,561
"Why do you ask..."
"Two Dogs Fucking?"

465
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:09,235
That's NOT the end of the joke.

466
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,282
So anyway, back to me.

467
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:15,629
Jesus!
What's happening?

468
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:17,992
Um... I don't know.

469
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:34,566
Oh, my God.

470
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:54,599
Oh, Felicia.

471
00:32:54,634 --> 00:32:57,328
Where the fuck are we?

472
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,760
Shit! Shit! Shit!

473
00:33:25,288 --> 00:33:27,451
Oh, shit!

474
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:33,940
Well, I've had a look around

475
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,635
and we can safely assume
that I now know less about motors

476
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:41,412
than I did when I lifted up
that, uh... that bonnety thing.

477
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:43,529
Now what?

478
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:46,973
Let's not think about it yet
and eat brekkie, shall we?

479
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:48,925
Oh, that's a novel idea.

480
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:51,124
Let's stuff ourselves to death.

481
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:53,033
Imagine the headlines.

482
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:56,022
'Whales beach themselves
in the outback'.

483
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:59,010
'Mystery bumsticks dead in drag'.

484
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,404
There's no point walking back.

485
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:04,972
The only life I've seen
is hypnotised bunnies

486
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:10,706
and they're now
mostly wedged in the tyres.

487
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,994
Yes, and toast marshmallows
and chill champagne for their arrival.

488
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:16,144
What if they DON'T drive past?

489
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,234
Look, you're not helping here.
Just eat your hormones.

490
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:22,172
"Help". Why didn't we stick
to the main road?

491
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:25,464
What difference does it make?!
You started this, Anthony Belrose.

492
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,564
And I suggest start thinking about
how to get us back

493
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,152
or I don't fancy your chances
of being a husband again.

494
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:38,598
Jesus. What are we gonna do?

495
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,659
We're gonna start
with a little face-lift.

496
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:44,202
Nothing like a new frock
to brighten up your day.

497
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:49,104
Purple?!

498
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:52,348
It's not PURPLE. It's lavender.

499
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:53,870
Whaddya think?

500
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,319
Oh, it's nice...
in a hideous sort of a way.

501
00:34:58,854 --> 00:35:00,219
Where are you going?

502
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:02,294
If you think I'm sitting around

503
00:35:02,294 --> 00:35:05,158
watching Picasso
take on the public transport system

504
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:07,109
you've got another thing coming.

505
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:10,357
I'll be back with the cavalry
in a couple of hours.

506
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:14,088
There goes a transsexual.
Last seen heading south.

507
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:16,666
We called her Bernie,
but her real name was...

508
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:17,843
Adam!

509
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:09,668
Oooee!

510
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:12,973
Oooee!

511
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:29,710
Aaaggh!

512
00:38:10,508 --> 00:38:12,727
Oh!

513
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:16,336
Help! Help!

514
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:19,954
What's that, Pa?
What?

515
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:21,890
Up there, yer nong.

516
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,685
Looks like a woman!

517
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:26,107
Help!

518
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,352
Oh, thank God.

519
00:38:36,822 --> 00:38:38,040
Thank you.

520
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,492
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

521
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:43,560
<i>...face...</i>

522
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,886
<i>I just walked in
to find you here</i>

523
00:38:45,886 --> 00:38:48,294
<i>With that sad look
upon your face...</i>

524
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:00,704
You fucken beauty!

525
00:39:09,462 --> 00:39:11,537
Ooh, ooh, shit. Ooh.

526
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:14,236
Aaah! Bernie,
I'm so glad to see you!

527
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:17,148
I wish I could say the same.

528
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:21,340
I was just drawing up the will.
Come and meet our saviours.

529
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:25,491
Tony, Adam,
this is Mr and Mrs Spencer.

530
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,690
Hello!
Hello!

531
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,164
Stop! Stop!

532
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,974
Shit.

533
00:39:38,356 --> 00:39:40,680
Oh, for goodness sakes,
look at yourself, Mitz.

534
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,457
How many times do I have to tell you
green is not your colour?

535
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,800
Do you think about Trumpet much?

536
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,334
No.

537
00:39:55,747 --> 00:39:59,897
Trumpet was just a nice kid
who had a thing about transsexuals.

538
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,475
Lots of people do.

539
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:05,069
Sort of...
bent status symbol, you know.

540
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,478
"My girlfriend used to be
a boyfriend" - that sort of thing.

541
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:10,405
Always good for a supper invite.

542
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:14,047
Still... it was better than nothing.

543
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:19,601
Nothing. Nothing for miles.

544
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:26,740
<i>Can you hear
the drums, Fernando...</i>

545
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,854
I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

546
00:40:29,854 --> 00:40:31,804
No more fuckin' Abba.

547
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,540
OK, we may as well
put the time to good use.

548
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,989
Come on, girls. Off your snatches.

549
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:39,524
Rehearsal time.

550
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,060
<i>Nah, nah, nah...</i>

551
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,634
<i>And so you're back
From outer space...</i>

552
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:46,041
OK? Two bobs to start with, alright?

553
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:48,489
Boring.
Ready?

554
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,897
<i>Da da da da</i>

555
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,599
<i>Dee dee dee dee</i>

556
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,342
<i>Dee dee dee dee dee dee</i>

557
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:56,044
<i>This look upon your face...</i>

558
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:58,119
Oh, I did this years ago.

559
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,561
You did it SO beautifully
and darling, you do it SO well.

560
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,926
Right, from the top.

561
00:41:04,926 --> 00:41:06,462
One, two...

562
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,329
<i>Go on, now go</i>

563
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,156
<i>Walk out the door</i>

564
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:12,273
<i>Just turn around now</i>

565
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:14,846
<i>'Cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

566
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:18,457
<i>Weren't you the one who tried
to hurt me with goodbye...</i>

567
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:20,853
Aaaagh!

568
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,389
Hello.

569
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,923
Nice night for it.

570
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:35,142
<i>Feel alright</i>

571
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:39,127
<i>Yes, I feel alright</i>

572
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:45,602
<i>Well, I feel alright
with you right by my side...</i>

573
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:09,053
I think we just... crashed a party.

574
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:12,288
No, come on.
You'll be right.

575
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:28,668
Welcome to my office. Have a seat.

576
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:44,132
Bernice, what possibly possessed
you to wear THAT to a corroboree?

577
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:45,545
Shut your face.

578
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:05,836
Bravo!
Fabulous!

579
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:12,638
Well, girls, I guess it's our turn.

580
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,598
<i>At first I was afraid
I was petrified</i>

581
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:28,200
<i>Kept thinking I could never live
without you by my side</i>

582
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:32,753
<i>But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong</i>

583
00:43:32,788 --> 00:43:34,643
<i>And I grew strong</i>

584
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,123
<i>And I learned how to get along</i>

585
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:40,228
<i>And so you're back
From outer space</i>

586
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:44,985
<i>I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face</i>

587
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,134
<i>I should have changed
that stupid lock</i>

588
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:49,300
<i>And made you leave your key</i>

589
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:53,388
<i>If I'd known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me</i>

590
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,702
<i>Go on now go</i>

591
00:43:54,737 --> 00:43:56,811
<i>Walk out the door</i>

592
00:43:56,846 --> 00:43:58,963
<i>Just turn around now</i>

593
00:43:58,998 --> 00:44:01,789
<i>'Cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

594
00:44:01,824 --> 00:44:05,802
<i>Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye</i>

595
00:44:05,837 --> 00:44:10,059
<i>Did you think I'd crumble
Think I'd lay down and die?</i>

596
00:44:10,158 --> 00:44:11,592
<i>Oh, no, not I</i>

597
00:44:11,627 --> 00:44:13,527
<i>I will survive</i>

598
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:18,197
<i>As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive</i>

599
00:44:18,232 --> 00:44:22,481
<i>I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give</i>

600
00:44:22,516 --> 00:44:25,676
<i>And I'll survive
I will survive</i>

601
00:44:25,711 --> 00:44:28,315
<i>Hey, hey...</i>

602
00:44:34,403 --> 00:44:36,890
Hey, take a look at that.

603
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:43,033
Ooooh!
I've got an idea!

604
00:44:43,468 --> 00:44:46,940
<i>It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart</i>

605
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,924
<i>Just trying hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart</i>

606
00:44:50,924 --> 00:44:55,158
<i>And I spent, oh, so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself</i>

607
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:59,308
<i>I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high</i>

608
00:44:59,308 --> 00:45:00,927
<i>And you see me</i>

609
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:03,251
<i>Somebody new</i>

610
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:07,195
<i>I'm not that chained-up little
person still in love with you</i>

611
00:45:07,195 --> 00:45:11,552
<i>So you felt like dropping in
and just expect me to be free</i>

612
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:15,288
<i>Now I'm saving all my lovin'
for someone who's lovin' me</i>

613
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:17,944
<i>Go on now go</i>

614
00:45:17,944 --> 00:45:19,812
<i>Walk out the door</i>

615
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:24,627
<i>Just turn around now 'cause
you're not welcome anymore...</i>

616
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,003
So... you actually make money
by dressing up like a woman?

617
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:37,486
Oh, sure. You can make
a fine living in a pair of heels.

618
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:40,389
Why, Allen? Do you want a job?

619
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:53,258
Oh! If only this dress could talk.

620
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:56,081
Sometimes I wonder
where I get my taste from.

621
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:57,617
Definitely not my mother.

622
00:45:57,617 --> 00:46:01,383
Serves me right for letting her
buy me these awful clothes.

623
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,045
What's this?

624
00:46:06,457 --> 00:46:10,608
That, darling, is my most treasured
possession in the whole wide world.

625
00:46:10,608 --> 00:46:12,683
But what is it?

626
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:16,461
Well, a few years ago I went on a pilgrimage
backstage to an Abba concert,

627
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:19,822
hoping to grab an audience
with Her Royal Highness, Agnetha.

628
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:22,521
Well, when she ducked
into the ladies loo,

629
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:24,222
naturally I followed her in...

630
00:46:24,222 --> 00:46:26,297
...and after
she'd finished her business

631
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:28,040
I ducked into the cubicle

632
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,818
only to find she'd left
a little gift in the toilet bowl.

633
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:33,976
What are you telling me?

634
00:46:33,976 --> 00:46:36,254
This is an Abba turd?

635
00:46:39,911 --> 00:46:42,898
I know what we can do with THIS.

636
00:46:43,108 --> 00:46:45,432
Are you right?

637
00:46:45,432 --> 00:46:47,216
Hang on!

638
00:46:47,216 --> 00:46:49,085
OK! Go!

639
00:46:49,085 --> 00:46:53,641
Whoo-hoo!

640
00:47:11,124 --> 00:47:13,407
There! Whoo-hoo!

641
00:47:42,378 --> 00:47:45,902
Afternoon.
What seems to be the problem?

642
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:53,397
What a nice dog.

643
00:47:53,297 --> 00:47:54,874
What's its name?

644
00:47:54,874 --> 00:47:56,408
Herpes.

645
00:47:57,155 --> 00:47:59,680
If she's good, she'll heel.

646
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,899
Things get pretty quiet around here.

647
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:06,866
We're a bit starved
of entertainment.

648
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:08,455
Glad we could oblige.

649
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,762
How does it look?

650
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:14,482
Well, your gas tank's
chock-a-block full of crud.

651
00:48:14,482 --> 00:48:18,882
Travelling a rough road on
a low tank chucks it into the motor.

652
00:48:18,882 --> 00:48:21,289
Your fuel line's blocked,
injectors are stuffed...

653
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:25,357
So does that mean you can fix it?
In the short term.

654
00:48:25,357 --> 00:48:28,469
What you blokes need
is a new gas tank.

655
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:31,218
Don't suppose
there's one lying around?

656
00:48:31,253 --> 00:48:32,714
No, sorry.

657
00:48:32,749 --> 00:48:35,442
Could pick one up
in Coober Pedy in about a week.

658
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:38,464
When do you have to be in Alice?
Six days.

659
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,955
We can clear it out
and hope for the best.

660
00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:44,906
You might make it.

661
00:48:44,906 --> 00:48:47,189
Won't know unless you try.

662
00:48:47,189 --> 00:48:49,513
Refreshments!

663
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:52,087
Lemonade here - I make!

664
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:54,867
That's very nice, darling.
Please... go back inside.

665
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:57,939
Lemonade here - I make.
Lemonade for guests.

666
00:48:57,939 --> 00:49:00,761
No, darling, please!

667
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:03,240
I make chockrit cracker!

668
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:08,564
Thank you!

669
00:49:08,564 --> 00:49:10,100
We put cream on?

670
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,508
Er... no, no.
It's... um... face cream.

671
00:49:12,508 --> 00:49:14,915
It's for face.
Ah!

672
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:19,149
Bob, Cynthia - thank you.

673
00:49:19,149 --> 00:49:21,182
I love lamb with meringue.

674
00:49:21,182 --> 00:49:22,884
Thank you for the company.

675
00:49:22,884 --> 00:49:26,620
Like I said earlier, new faces
are pretty hard to come by here.

676
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,027
Should I may asking?
Need you off the highway?

677
00:49:29,392 --> 00:49:31,807
Oh, now,
that's a bloody good question.

678
00:49:31,807 --> 00:49:36,025
Glad you bothered. Don't get
your type out here very often.

679
00:49:36,622 --> 00:49:41,356
Me like to sing too - me like...
Yeah, pretty damn quiet.

680
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:43,952
Thought about opening
a video business,

681
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:46,370
but I suppose we gotta wait
for television first.

682
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:49,095
Me perform for you. Me dance too.

683
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,950
My wife was in the, uh...
entertainment business.

684
00:49:51,985 --> 00:49:54,743
Yeah. You perform here?

685
00:49:54,778 --> 00:49:56,448
You thinking of performing here?

686
00:49:56,483 --> 00:49:59,424
I mean, you'll be here
at least another night.

687
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:03,025
Um... well, the thought
hadn't really... crossed my mind.

688
00:50:03,025 --> 00:50:06,690
Well, I'll talk to Wally at the pub.
Everybody would love it.

689
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:11,188
Oh, I'm not sure our show
would go down too well out here.

690
00:50:12,193 --> 00:50:15,551
Should I may asking.
What kind of cabaret do you do?

691
00:50:15,501 --> 00:50:17,576
We dress up in women's clothes

692
00:50:17,576 --> 00:50:21,270
and parade around mouthing the words
to other people's songs.

693
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,715
You mean, sort of like them...
what are they called?

694
00:50:24,715 --> 00:50:26,251
Les Girls?

695
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:29,696
Yeah, I've seen 'em in Sydney
when I was young!

696
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,356
Fantastic! Just terrific!

697
00:50:31,356 --> 00:50:37,374
Bob, you are looking at probably the
most famous Les Girl ever produced!

698
00:50:37,374 --> 00:50:40,322
You're kidding me!
Give me a break.

699
00:50:40,322 --> 00:50:43,310
I was never that famous.
I'm not joking.

700
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,548
What? I mean,
I wouldn't have seen you, but...

701
00:50:46,548 --> 00:50:49,826
That was 30 years back.
Oh, you'd be surprised.

702
00:50:49,826 --> 00:50:51,901
Me perform for you. Me sing...!

703
00:50:51,901 --> 00:50:54,932
No, Cynthia. You no perform.
They perform, not you.

704
00:51:01,531 --> 00:51:04,270
Well! A real live Les Girls show.

705
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,584
Right, this calls for a celebration.

706
00:51:10,745 --> 00:51:14,691
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
Oh, shut your twat.

707
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:17,418
Our frocks were the sensation
of Broken Hill, remember?

708
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:20,848
Broken Hill had a K-Mart.
They knew what a frock was.

709
00:51:20,848 --> 00:51:23,874
Christ, you should see
what this woman is wearing.

710
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:27,186
It's not a frock.
It's a piece of corrugated iron!

711
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:33,442
Can I come in?
Only if you're single!

712
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:42,374
Oh, you look, uh... incredible.

713
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:44,626
Where did we find guy?

714
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:46,685
Keep dishing out
the compliments, Bob.

715
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,973
Flattery gets you everywhere.

716
00:51:48,008 --> 00:51:49,567
Now, where's
that lovely wife of yours?

717
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:53,858
She's at home. She's, uh...
not allowed in the pub anymore.

718
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:55,370
Really? Why?

719
00:51:56,071 --> 00:52:00,553
She got problem of alcohol - everytime she's in
the pub she makes a fool of herself.

720
00:52:00,553 --> 00:52:02,666
I know how she feels.

721
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:08,536
Well, we're all waiting.
Are you ready?

722
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:10,224
Bob...

723
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:12,839
...we're having second thoughts.

724
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:16,501
You can't back out.
Every man and his dog's here.

725
00:52:16,536 --> 00:52:20,208
They're not chained up are they?
Oh, you blokes!

726
00:52:20,243 --> 00:52:21,980
Sorry. You girls.

727
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,955
You'll be fine.
Take my word for it.

728
00:52:59,967 --> 00:53:04,160
<i>There's nothing more
that I'd like to do</i>

729
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,065
<i>Than take the floor
and dance with you</i>

730
00:53:07,065 --> 00:53:15,317
<i>Keep dancing
Let's keep dancing</i>

731
00:53:19,807 --> 00:53:22,203
<i>Shake it! Shake it!</i>

732
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:29,478
<i>Shake it! Shake it!</i>

733
00:53:29,478 --> 00:53:34,030
<i>Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah!</i>

734
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:39,025
<i>Show them how to do it now
Show them how to do it now!</i>

735
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,359
YEAH!

736
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:45,291
Yeah, right.

737
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:51,261
Here she goes!

738
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,197
What the hell is going on?

739
00:54:56,484 --> 00:54:58,477
Oh, she's not!

740
00:54:58,477 --> 00:55:00,731
Is she?

741
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:05,569
Oh, you can't do that
with a ping-pong ball!

742
00:55:06,727 --> 00:55:08,427
Do you want a bet?

743
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,712
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh!

744
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:39,723
Help me!

745
00:55:39,723 --> 00:55:42,254
He's taking me away! Help me!

746
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:52,156
I'm going!

747
00:55:52,156 --> 00:55:54,563
Darling, there's nothing
we can't work out.

748
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:57,261
You no good man.
Now, don't be silly.

749
00:55:57,261 --> 00:56:00,540
You want good wife -
you be good husband.

750
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,574
Darling, don't go.

751
00:56:02,574 --> 00:56:06,305
I no like you anyway.
You got little ding-a-ling.

752
00:56:20,852 --> 00:56:23,965
Some days you just shouldn't
get out of bed.

753
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:26,576
In my opinion, you should wait here

754
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:28,780
until I get back from Coober Pedy
with the new gas tank

755
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,224
Then again,
you listened to my last opinion.

756
00:56:32,224 --> 00:56:36,126
Forget it, Bob.
It's time we made a move.

757
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,469
I'm just a gifted amateur
around here.

758
00:56:38,504 --> 00:56:41,416
There's no way a nice frock
and a catchy tune

759
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:44,886
can compete with three ping-pong
balls, two cigarettes and a pint of beer.

760
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:49,159
I'll play it safe and stick
to the main drag, pardon the pun.

761
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:50,695
Well, goodbye, Bob.

762
00:56:50,695 --> 00:56:53,305
Thanks for a very educational stay.

763
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,803
I'd love to be able
to open a bottle like that.

764
00:56:56,215 --> 00:56:59,611
Bernadette,
it's certainly been an honour

765
00:56:59,611 --> 00:57:00,979
meeting a member of Les Girls.

766
00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:03,660
And it's been an honour
to meet a gentleman.

767
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:08,272
Believe me, Bob, these days
gentlemen are an endangered species.

768
00:57:10,286 --> 00:57:15,390
Unlike bloody drag queens
who just keep breeding like rabbits!

769
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:24,350
Oh, fuck it!

770
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:29,887
Bob! Fancy a free ride
to Coober Pedy?

771
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:38,355
Now, listen, Bob.
Let's get one thing straight.

772
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:42,506
We wear the frocks, but that
doesn't mean you wear the pants.

773
00:57:42,506 --> 00:57:44,208
Right. Where do I sleep?

774
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:46,283
Oh! Anywhere that takes your fancy!

775
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:48,679
The roof will do me fine.

776
00:57:50,185 --> 00:57:51,720
Thank you, Bob.

777
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,795
I don't know what to say.

778
00:57:53,795 --> 00:57:58,403
That's alright. Might as well get
there earlier. Bit of R and R.

779
00:57:58,403 --> 00:58:00,598
God knows I need it.

780
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:28,329
Can I ask you a personal question,
if you don't mind?

781
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:30,902
Sure.
Why?

782
00:58:30,902 --> 00:58:34,089
Why do you... you know?

783
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:39,162
You mean the $64,000 question?

784
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:42,759
That's the girl.
Don't tear the wrapping paper.

785
00:58:42,794 --> 00:58:47,336
Just slide the ribbon off and we can
see what Santa's brought you.

786
00:58:47,371 --> 00:58:49,112
Here it comes now.

787
00:58:49,147 --> 00:58:51,177
What is it?

788
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:54,157
Oh, it's a... It's a...

789
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,540
...cement mixer.

790
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:03,687
Have you been changing the cards
around again, Ralph?

791
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,905
So, I guess I had no choice
in the matter.

792
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,404
For fuck's sake! Watch where
you're driving, you stupid bitch!

793
00:59:14,404 --> 00:59:16,165
You trying to fucken kill me or something?

794
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,550
My fault!

795
00:59:17,585 --> 00:59:20,206
Sorry, Bob.
I thought it was Bernadette.

796
00:59:23,251 --> 00:59:27,152
One-two-three, two-two-three,
three-two-three...

797
00:59:27,152 --> 00:59:28,854
Now you're getting it.

798
00:59:28,854 --> 00:59:31,179
Who taught you to waltz?
My wife.

799
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:32,714
Oh, how sweet.

800
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:35,910
You and the missus down at
Arthur Murray's every Tuesday

801
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,529
practising your hearts out.

802
00:59:37,529 --> 00:59:39,521
Makes me want to sick up.

803
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:41,057
Married?

804
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:42,800
Yes, married.

805
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,929
We've only recently discovered

806
00:59:44,929 --> 00:59:47,422
young Anthony here
bats for both teams.

807
00:59:47,457 --> 00:59:50,176
I do not!
Oh, so we're straight?

808
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,167
No.
Oh, we're not?

809
00:59:52,202 --> 00:59:53,825
We're a donut puncher after all?

810
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,532
No.
Then what are we?

811
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:57,071
I don't fucking know!

812
00:59:58,988 --> 01:00:01,893
What the fuck's that?

813
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,617
Good evening.

814
01:00:08,617 --> 01:00:10,791
Nice night for it.

815
01:00:11,648 --> 01:00:14,282
Oh, OK. Goodnight then.

816
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,049
What a rude woman.

817
01:00:26,941 --> 01:00:30,801
And that's the power steering pump.
And that's the radiator fan.

818
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:32,710
How interesting.
Simple.

819
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:36,113
That's the rubber band
that drives the whole thing...

820
01:00:36,113 --> 01:00:38,935
Oh! Yes!

821
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:42,920
Hey! Who wants first bath?

822
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,581
Whoo-ooh!

823
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:00,346
I won!

824
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:12,471
Can I help you, ma'am?

825
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:24,094
OK! Turn her over!

826
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:46,127
<i>I don't care
if the sun don't shine</i>

827
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:48,866
<i>I get my loving in the evening time</i>

828
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:53,308
<i>When I'm with my baby</i>

829
01:01:53,308 --> 01:01:56,088
<i>It's no fun with the sun around</i>

830
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:59,202
<i>But I get going
when the sun goes down</i>

831
01:01:59,202 --> 01:02:03,435
<i>And I meet my baby</i>

832
01:02:03,435 --> 01:02:06,880
<i>That's when we kiss
and kiss and kiss</i>

833
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,038
<i>And then we kiss some more</i>

834
01:02:09,038 --> 01:02:12,317
<i>Don't ask how many times we kiss</i>

835
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:15,098
<i>At a time like this
who keeps score?</i>

836
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:18,211
<i>So, I don't care
if the sun don't shine</i>

837
01:02:18,211 --> 01:02:20,951
<i>I get my loving in the evening time</i>

838
01:02:20,951 --> 01:02:25,141
<i>When I'm with my baby!</i>

839
01:02:46,455 --> 01:02:48,313
That's it over there.

840
01:02:48,313 --> 01:02:51,901
It's an OK room - with a shower.
Bags first!

841
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:53,567
Is hot water all you think about?

842
01:02:53,602 --> 01:02:57,676
No. A shower, bed
and nice meal will do fine.

843
01:02:57,676 --> 01:03:00,932
If you think I'm just going to
watch television, you're wrong.

844
01:03:00,932 --> 01:03:02,956
Now, look.
You blokes watch your back.

845
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:04,849
It's a pretty tough little town.

846
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:08,513
They go down holes, blow things up,
then come up again.

847
01:03:08,513 --> 01:03:10,334
That sums things up.
Oh, fabulous!

848
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:13,829
You're welcome to hang out with us, Bob.
If you got nothing better to do.

849
01:03:13,864 --> 01:03:18,240
Yeah. I'm meeting some of the boys
in the old drive-in for a booze-up.

850
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:19,279
Like the old days.

851
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:21,659
I want to go to the boys club!

852
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:26,917
You'll have supper with us
or stay in your room and watch TV.

853
01:03:51,502 --> 01:03:53,079
Ha!

854
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:55,975
He's a good man, our Bob.

855
01:03:56,817 --> 01:03:58,809
Yeah.

856
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:00,718
Not my type, though.

857
01:04:00,718 --> 01:04:03,707
Oh! Don't come the raw prawn with me!

858
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:07,193
I can spot the fluttering
of a beaded lash from 300 paces!

859
01:04:07,193 --> 01:04:10,180
Oh, get out! He's far too old.

860
01:04:11,842 --> 01:04:14,285
Mind you, so am I.
Mmm.

861
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:17,725
Did you catch that mail-order bride?

862
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,757
Why'd he marry? I'm dying to ask.

863
01:04:23,298 --> 01:04:26,494
Oops! Sorry.
It's alright.

864
01:04:26,494 --> 01:04:28,196
Don't worry about it.

865
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:31,018
You're the world's best husband.

866
01:04:31,018 --> 01:04:34,535
And, given the chance,
a perfectly good father too.

867
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:37,825
Do you really think so?

868
01:04:37,825 --> 01:04:40,185
Why? Thinking about children?

869
01:04:41,436 --> 01:04:43,466
Yes, as a matter of fact.

870
01:04:59,989 --> 01:05:03,885
Um, do you have
'The Texas Chainsaw Mascara'?

871
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:09,329
You ever wanted kids?

872
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:13,934
Sure. But I've learned
not to think about it.

873
01:05:16,675 --> 01:05:19,995
You think an old queen's
capable of raising a child?

874
01:05:19,995 --> 01:05:22,943
Well, Elizabeth did
a pretty good job.

875
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,826
Prince Charles is a wonderful boy.

876
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:29,110
Edward's still a bit of a worry.

877
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:33,526
What happens
if they turn out like Adam?

878
01:05:33,526 --> 01:05:37,027
You stuff them back in
and ask for a refund.

879
01:05:39,918 --> 01:05:41,453
Stupid little shit.

880
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:45,439
I dread to think what he's up to.

881
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:12,166
Oooh.

882
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:14,866
Hello.

883
01:06:14,866 --> 01:06:17,015
I'm new in town.

884
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:20,511
No kidding.

885
01:06:20,511 --> 01:06:23,084
Could I have a bloody Mary, please?

886
01:06:23,084 --> 01:06:26,685
It's a beer or nothing... sweetheart.

887
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,129
Well, I'd better have a beer then.

888
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:33,088
Cheers.

889
01:06:37,196 --> 01:06:39,263
What are you all looking at?

890
01:06:42,385 --> 01:06:43,919
I'm sorry.

891
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:49,482
Didn't mean to stare.
We don't usually get women down here.

892
01:06:49,482 --> 01:06:51,019
Oh.

893
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:56,366
So what do women do around here
besides watching videos?

894
01:06:58,365 --> 01:07:01,305
Well, well, well!
Look who we have here.

895
01:07:03,579 --> 01:07:06,065
You know that bloke, do you?

896
01:07:10,728 --> 01:07:12,263
No.

897
01:07:12,602 --> 01:07:17,651
So... who's going to show me
the sights?

898
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:20,915
It'd be my pleasure.

899
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,794
Oh.

900
01:07:25,054 --> 01:07:26,588
So, how about it?

901
01:07:28,955 --> 01:07:32,809
I suppose a fuck's
now out of the question.

902
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:39,863
Get her, Frank!
Go, Frank!

903
01:07:42,222 --> 01:07:45,988
Come on, boys! Who wants to see
my map of Tasmania?

904
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:51,635
So. I never got a chance to tell my parents
what a wonderful childhood I'd had.

905
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,192
They never spoke to me again
after I'd had... the chop.

906
01:08:04,215 --> 01:08:07,038
I think I have something
to tell you.

907
01:08:07,038 --> 01:08:10,316
Oh, shit.

908
01:08:10,316 --> 01:08:12,677
Get after her!

909
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,832
OK, fellas!
Don't forget how to treat a lady.

910
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:29,367
You fucking freak!

911
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:34,432
Hold him down.

912
01:08:34,432 --> 01:08:36,009
Spread his legs apart.

913
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:37,873
Oh, no. Please, don't!

914
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:42,027
Frank, stop!

915
01:08:42,027 --> 01:08:45,015
Stop! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?!

916
01:08:45,015 --> 01:08:47,423
You mean you do know
this cocksucker.

917
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,083
Get off him, you mongrel!

918
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:53,151
He was joking, OK?
You leave the little bugger alone.

919
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:54,853
Get out of there, Bob.

920
01:08:54,853 --> 01:08:56,430
Calm down, Frank.

921
01:08:56,430 --> 01:09:00,486
Put the faggot down and get out
or you'll be next.

922
01:09:00,521 --> 01:09:02,587
Frank!
Get out of there!

923
01:09:02,622 --> 01:09:06,100
Stop flexing your muscles
you big pile of budgie turd.

924
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,188
I'm sure your mates will be much more impressed

925
01:09:09,223 --> 01:09:13,082
if you go back to the pub
and fuck a couple pigs on the bar.

926
01:09:13,117 --> 01:09:14,278
Bernadette, please...

927
01:09:14,278 --> 01:09:16,394
Bernadette?!

928
01:09:16,394 --> 01:09:20,745
Well, I'll be darned.
The whole circus is in town.

929
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:23,390
I suppose you want a fuck too,
do you?

930
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,650
Come on, Bernadette.
Come and fuck me.

931
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,600
That's it.

932
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:31,004
Come on. Come and fuck me.

933
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:33,827
Come on.

934
01:09:33,827 --> 01:09:35,362
Fuck me.

935
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:44,545
There, now you're fucked.

936
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:48,555
You stupid bloody idiot!
Drugs, for Christ's sake!

937
01:09:48,555 --> 01:09:51,970
Well, three cheers for you!
I hope you're happy now!

938
01:09:53,044 --> 01:09:54,858
You bloody fuckwit!

939
01:09:58,564 --> 01:10:00,099
It's funny.

940
01:10:01,304 --> 01:10:02,840
We all sit around

941
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,487
mindlessly slagging off
that vile stink-hole of a city.

942
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:12,261
But in its own strange way
it takes care of us.

943
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:16,412
I don't know if that ugly wall
of suburbia's been put there

944
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:21,144
to stop them getting in
or us getting out.

945
01:10:23,676 --> 01:10:25,210
Come on.

946
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:29,030
Don't let it drag you down.

947
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:31,752
Let it toughen you up.

948
01:10:32,143 --> 01:10:35,446
I can only fight
because I've learnt to.

949
01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:40,749
Being a man one day
and a woman the next isn't easy thing to do.

950
01:10:44,014 --> 01:10:46,973
Sorry. Can't help you.
No worries, Pete.

951
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:53,505
Are we bunny-hopping
all the way to Alice?

952
01:10:53,505 --> 01:10:56,951
Not good. This is the man
to help's a fair way out of town.

953
01:10:56,951 --> 01:10:58,611
Like how fair?

954
01:10:58,611 --> 01:11:00,312
Couple of hundred klicks fair.

955
01:11:00,312 --> 01:11:04,671
No matter. I've go nothing else
to do today. Let's get out of here.

956
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:06,737
Come on, Adam. We're not here.

957
01:11:35,168 --> 01:11:38,603
Some things are said
in the heat of the moment.

958
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,715
I'm sorry I got angry with you
last night.

959
01:11:44,715 --> 01:11:47,122
Oh, I dare say you deserved it.

960
01:11:47,122 --> 01:11:49,602
Anyway, that's enough of that.

961
01:11:51,231 --> 01:11:55,008
This is quite an experience
sitting her with you now.

962
01:11:55,008 --> 01:11:57,044
I can quite safely say

963
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:01,911
that I think your taste in clothing
is absolutely terrible

964
01:12:01,911 --> 01:12:03,695
because you can't say a word,
can you?

965
01:12:04,638 --> 01:12:07,294
Oh, this is great fun!

966
01:12:10,915 --> 01:12:14,443
We're going to have a problem
finding this guy with the tank.

967
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:17,183
Why say that?
Because he's not out here.

968
01:12:17,183 --> 01:12:19,578
He's out here. He's in Alice.

969
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:23,533
I can't go back to Coober Pedy
for a while.

970
01:12:23,533 --> 01:12:26,637
I'm not the most popular bloke
back there anymore.

971
01:12:31,336 --> 01:12:33,204
Ooof!

972
01:12:39,347 --> 01:12:41,173
Hello.

973
01:12:41,173 --> 01:12:43,248
Hello!

974
01:12:43,248 --> 01:12:46,188
Who are you?
I your wife!

975
01:12:49,183 --> 01:12:52,214
Guess I'll be going home then.
You no going!

976
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:54,621
I coming too. I your wife!

977
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:57,111
See? I your wife!

978
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:59,270
Silly girl.

979
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:02,128
Should've done her homework better.

980
01:13:02,163 --> 01:13:05,694
She always thought...
She thought I was from Sydney.

981
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:08,069
Why in gods name did you bring her home?

982
01:13:08,069 --> 01:13:10,502
She was me wife.

983
01:13:10,537 --> 01:13:12,120
Couldn't you sell her off?

984
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:15,353
Oh, the party's over, everyone.
It talks.

985
01:13:15,388 --> 01:13:17,644
Can't keep a good bitch down.

986
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,889
What time
will we be in Alice Springs?

987
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:23,313
Late tomorrow arvo.

988
01:13:23,313 --> 01:13:25,389
How long will you be staying?

989
01:13:25,389 --> 01:13:26,924
Don't know.

990
01:13:26,924 --> 01:13:28,624
A couple of days maybe.

991
01:13:29,663 --> 01:13:33,441
A big day for you tomorrow!
We'll all meet the missus!

992
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:35,142
I saw that smile, Felicia!

993
01:13:35,142 --> 01:13:37,920
One word, one derogatory word

994
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,035
and I'll take you back
to your mate in Coober Pedy.

995
01:13:42,032 --> 01:13:44,281
Please, everyone.
Tomorrow will be tough.

996
01:13:44,316 --> 01:13:46,215
Look.
Please don't make it any harder, then I has to be.

997
01:13:46,225 --> 01:13:50,707
We're only teasing. We won't open
our mouths until you give the word.

998
01:13:50,707 --> 01:13:52,407
And then it's open season.

999
01:14:06,438 --> 01:14:08,430
Oh, well. Time for bed.

1000
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,837
Got to look good for the wife in the morning.

1001
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:13,453
Come along, Adam.
Time for your beauty sleep.

1002
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:15,611
Come on!

1003
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:17,676
Will you two be joining us?

1004
01:14:18,723 --> 01:14:21,837
I just thought a little
I'd have one for the road.

1005
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:23,372
How about you, Bob?

1006
01:14:23,372 --> 01:14:24,949
Sounds good to me.

1007
01:14:24,949 --> 01:14:27,482
Alright, then.
See you in the morning.

1008
01:14:27,482 --> 01:14:29,555
Goodnight!

1009
01:14:31,343 --> 01:14:33,419
Another piece of cake, Bob?

1010
01:14:33,419 --> 01:14:36,157
Ah, no.
Oh.

1011
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:44,376
So... tell me about you.

1012
01:14:44,476 --> 01:14:47,963
Can't complain.

1013
01:14:47,963 --> 01:14:49,706
Life's a lot simpler now.

1014
01:14:49,706 --> 01:14:52,196
Spent 30 years
wandering around the world

1015
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:56,257
only to find I was better off
where I started.

1016
01:14:57,841 --> 01:14:59,917
Not much, but it's my turf.

1017
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,617
Oooh! Shit!

1018
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,514
Adam!

1019
01:15:19,466 --> 01:15:21,666
Adam!

1020
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:24,227
What?
Guess who didn't come home?

1021
01:15:31,752 --> 01:15:34,907
I've waited all my life for this.

1022
01:15:34,907 --> 01:15:38,642
Bernice has left her cake
out in the rain!

1023
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,732
<i>Hava nagila
Have a hangover</i>

1024
01:15:47,732 --> 01:15:50,762
<i>Hava nagila
Hi hi hi!</i>

1025
01:15:52,588 --> 01:15:56,071
<i>Di di, di-di-di-di
Di di, di-di-di-di</i>

1026
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:21,851
My fucking back's killing me.

1027
01:16:21,851 --> 01:16:23,884
I need a crap.

1028
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:26,988
Do you want me to go in?
I'll go.

1029
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:31,355
Excuse me.
You can't park your bus here.

1030
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:34,094
Are you planning on staying here?
I'm sorry...

1031
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:36,502
Could you direct me to Marian Barber?

1032
01:16:36,502 --> 01:16:38,577
We're the cabaret act from Sydney.

1033
01:16:38,577 --> 01:16:41,441
Oh, right, right!
Just go through to reception.

1034
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:42,977
Thanks.
No worries.

1035
01:16:42,977 --> 01:16:45,373
It's alright, Lenny.
It's the drag queens!

1036
01:16:47,459 --> 01:16:51,195
Come on, Bob. Let's go try on
your new frock.

1037
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:52,730
G'day.

1038
01:16:54,723 --> 01:16:56,799
Just over there by the bar.

1039
01:16:56,799 --> 01:16:58,333
Thanks.

1040
01:17:03,647 --> 01:17:06,511
No, those three kegs
didn't arrive.

1041
01:17:06,511 --> 01:17:09,209
I need them today -
not tomorrow, but today.

1042
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:10,745
You're a doll.

1043
01:17:10,745 --> 01:17:12,279
What an arsehole.

1044
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:18,838
Oh, my God! Husband! Husband!

1045
01:17:18,838 --> 01:17:21,577
It's so good to see you!
Hiya, wife!

1046
01:17:21,577 --> 01:17:25,285
You're late. Where are the others?
Oh, they're outside.

1047
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,685
You've lost weight, you old queer.
About fucken time!

1048
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,389
I can fit into your old one-piece -
the one with the sunflowers.

1049
01:17:32,424 --> 01:17:34,075
What the hell do you do with it?

1050
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:37,174
'The Poseidon Adventure' routine.
You know, Shelley Winters.

1051
01:17:43,203 --> 01:17:44,772
Where is he?

1052
01:17:51,877 --> 01:17:55,405
One thing I'd like to do to you
a good spanking.

1053
01:17:55,405 --> 01:17:58,050
You can get it!

1054
01:17:58,085 --> 01:18:00,046
Spank, spank, spank!

1055
01:18:00,046 --> 01:18:02,364
I'll put you over my knee.

1056
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:04,917
I'll "spank, spank" you back!
Oops!

1057
01:18:04,952 --> 01:18:05,615
Benj.

1058
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:09,531
Do you remember Tick?

1059
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:17,645
Hello, Tick.

1060
01:18:22,467 --> 01:18:24,045
Hello.

1061
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:29,244
Where's the bloody bar?

1062
01:18:33,412 --> 01:18:35,362
Mr Belrose?

1063
01:18:35,362 --> 01:18:37,231
Yes?

1064
01:18:37,231 --> 01:18:40,011
Congratulations. It's a boy.

1065
01:18:43,497 --> 01:18:45,068
Oh!

1066
01:18:46,113 --> 01:18:47,939
Shit!
Are you OK?

1067
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:49,821
What's the matter? Oh, my God!
Help.

1068
01:18:49,821 --> 01:18:52,438
Christ's sake, Mitz,
why didn't you tell us?

1069
01:18:52,473 --> 01:18:54,595
Why hell did you shock me like that?

1070
01:18:54,595 --> 01:18:56,130
Ooh!

1071
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:59,244
This lump on my head's
growing by the second.

1072
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:02,952
I'm about to making
my Northern Territory debut

1073
01:19:02,987 --> 01:19:05,833
looking like a fucking
Warner Bros cartoon character

1074
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:07,225
has hit me with an iron.

1075
01:19:07,225 --> 01:19:10,313
I think you look more like a Disney witch myself.
Now shut your face Felicia!

1076
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:11,783
At least I don't look like

1077
01:19:11,783 --> 01:19:13,969
somebody's tried to open
a can of beans with my face.

1078
01:19:13,969 --> 01:19:17,538
I'm sorry girls. I coludn't stand off or you
bagging me for two weeks.

1079
01:19:17,538 --> 01:19:19,216
Anyway. What difference does it make now?

1080
01:19:19,216 --> 01:19:21,610
About two inches to my head from one.

1081
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:24,109
You gotta get looking him? He's got my profile.

1082
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:25,344
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1083
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:28,021
I hate to be practical here -
but does he know who you are?

1084
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:30,916
Does he know what you do for living?

1085
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:34,150
He knows his father's in
the show business cosmetics industry.

1086
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:36,603
Oh, Lord! I don't understand.

1087
01:19:36,603 --> 01:19:38,679
You don't, so stop trying to.

1088
01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:40,754
It'll be fine!
It'd better be.

1089
01:19:40,754 --> 01:19:43,439
Hello! Oh, stop wearing out
that mirror!

1090
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:45,444
Do you always knock before you enter?
Always. Why?

1091
01:19:45,444 --> 01:19:47,840
Haven't got anything to hide,
have you?

1092
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:51,296
Alright, girls,
you're on in 10 minutes.

1093
01:19:51,296 --> 01:19:53,082
You've been on since birth.

1094
01:19:53,082 --> 01:19:55,696
The word's out. There's a big crowd.

1095
01:19:55,696 --> 01:19:57,725
How big?
A full house.

1096
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:01,632
Where's Benj?
Safe and sound, asleep in bed.

1097
01:20:01,632 --> 01:20:04,661
Don't worry about a thing,
my little powder puff.

1098
01:20:04,661 --> 01:20:06,779
Can I come in?

1099
01:20:06,779 --> 01:20:08,397
Now, there's a gentleman.

1100
01:20:08,397 --> 01:20:10,261
Of course you can, Bob.

1101
01:20:11,427 --> 01:20:13,375
My Aunt Minnie in here?

1102
01:20:15,495 --> 01:20:17,860
Just... wanted to wish you luck.

1103
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,844
Thank you, Bob.
Thanks.

1104
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:23,588
To make up for last time.

1105
01:20:23,588 --> 01:20:26,328
Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

1106
01:20:26,328 --> 01:20:29,441
Let's get this show on the road.
You, out.

1107
01:20:29,441 --> 01:20:31,754
10-minute curtain call. Good luck.

1108
01:20:34,961 --> 01:20:37,368
That's quite a wife you've got, Mitz.

1109
01:20:37,368 --> 01:20:41,270
What's doing in a spare time - sanding back
the hulls of the oil tanker with her tongue?

1110
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,136
She sure is something!

1111
01:20:44,217 --> 01:20:45,835
Oh!
Chookers, girls.

1112
01:20:45,835 --> 01:20:47,994
Watch my jaw!
Mind my head.

1113
01:20:47,994 --> 01:20:49,611
Aren't we faaa-bulous!

1114
01:20:50,692 --> 01:20:54,137
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lasseters Casino, Alice Springs

1115
01:20:54,137 --> 01:20:56,088
presents Miss Mitzi del Gra,

1116
01:20:56,088 --> 01:20:59,990
Miss Felicia Jolly Good Fellow
and Miss Bernadette Basinger -

1117
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:02,397
the Sisters of the Simpson Desert.

1118
01:21:09,943 --> 01:21:12,143
<i>Meeting Mr Right</i>

1119
01:21:12,143 --> 01:21:14,219
<i>The man of my dreams</i>

1120
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:18,369
<i>The one who showed me true love
or at least it seemed</i>

1121
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:22,105
<i>With brown cocoa skin
and curly black hair</i>

1122
01:21:22,105 --> 01:21:25,923
<i>Just the way he looks at me -
that gentle, loving stare</i>

1123
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:30,240
<i>Finally you came along</i>

1124
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:34,100
<i>The way I feel about you
it just can't be wrong</i>

1125
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:38,666
<i>If you only knew
the way I feel about you</i>

1126
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:41,423
<i>I just can't describe it</i>

1127
01:21:41,423 --> 01:21:43,382
<i>Oh, no, no</i>

1128
01:21:43,382 --> 01:21:45,872
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1129
01:21:45,872 --> 01:21:50,812
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1130
01:21:50,812 --> 01:21:53,841
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1131
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:58,532
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it</i>

1132
01:21:58,532 --> 01:22:01,770
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1133
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:06,542
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1134
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:09,822
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1135
01:22:09,822 --> 01:22:14,512
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it...</i>

1136
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:18,164
<i>Seemed so many times
he seemed to be the one</i>

1137
01:22:18,164 --> 01:22:22,315
<i>But all he ever wanted
was to have a little fun</i>

1138
01:22:22,315 --> 01:22:26,507
<i>But now you've come along
and brightened up my world</i>

1139
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:30,658
<i>In my heart I feel it
I'm that special kind of girl</i>

1140
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:34,351
<i>Finally you came along</i>

1141
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:38,336
<i>The way I feel about you
it just can't be wrong</i>

1142
01:22:38,336 --> 01:22:42,612
<i>If you only knew
the way I feel about you</i>

1143
01:22:42,612 --> 01:22:45,434
<i>I just can't describe it</i>

1144
01:22:45,434 --> 01:22:46,969
<i>Oh, no, no</i>

1145
01:22:46,969 --> 01:22:49,585
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1146
01:22:49,585 --> 01:22:54,274
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1147
01:22:54,274 --> 01:22:57,512

1148
01:22:57,512 --> 01:23:02,244
<i>Right in front of my face

1149
01:23:02,244 --> 01:23:05,523
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1150
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:10,130
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1151
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:13,533
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1152
01:23:13,533 --> 01:23:18,141
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it...</i>

1153
01:23:18,141 --> 01:23:20,005
<i>Finally</i>

1154
01:23:21,087 --> 01:23:22,748
<i>Whoa</i>

1155
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:27,645
<i>Finally
Yeah, yeah</i>

1156
01:23:27,645 --> 01:23:29,597
<i>Whoa-oh-oh</i>

1157
01:23:29,597 --> 01:23:31,796
<i>Finally, baby</i>

1158
01:23:31,796 --> 01:23:33,996
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1159
01:23:33,996 --> 01:23:35,573
<i>Baby, yeah, yeah</i>

1160
01:23:35,573 --> 01:23:37,524
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1161
01:23:37,524 --> 01:23:39,433
<i>Baby, yeah, yeah</i>

1162
01:23:39,433 --> 01:23:41,591
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1163
01:23:41,591 --> 01:23:43,543
<i>Baby, yeah, yeah</i>

1164
01:23:43,543 --> 01:23:45,535
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1165
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:47,527
<i>Baby, yeah, yeah</i>

1166
01:23:47,527 --> 01:23:49,686
<i>Yeah, yeah, ow</i>

1167
01:24:06,598 --> 01:24:09,752
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1168
01:24:09,752 --> 01:24:14,442
<i>Right in front of my face
My two lips can't describe it</i>

1169
01:24:14,442 --> 01:24:17,763
<i>Finally it's happened to me</i>

1170
01:24:17,763 --> 01:24:22,453
<i>Right in front of my face
and I just cannot hide it</i>

1171
01:24:22,453 --> 01:24:25,400
<i>Finally
Oh, yeah</i>

1172
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:34,988
<i>Yeah, yeah...</i>

1173
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:38,387
<i>Finally
Oh, yeah.</i>

1174
01:24:55,473 --> 01:24:58,379
More!
Bravo!

1175
01:24:58,379 --> 01:25:00,205
Beauty!
Come on, everybody!

1176
01:25:00,205 --> 01:25:01,740
Yay!
More!

1177
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:03,442
Yes! More!

1178
01:25:03,442 --> 01:25:04,978
Hey-hey!
More! More!

1179
01:25:07,453 --> 01:25:08,989
More!
You were wonderful!

1180
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:11,438
We want more!
Yes!

1181
01:25:12,038 --> 01:25:13,781
Magnificent!
Yay!

1182
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:15,856
Bravo! Whoo!
More!

1183
01:25:15,856 --> 01:25:18,843
We want more!

1184
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:21,999
Come on, snap out of it.

1185
01:25:21,999 --> 01:25:23,618
Come on, mate.

1186
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,270
You'll be fine.

1187
01:25:27,229 --> 01:25:28,806
Come on, love.

1188
01:25:28,806 --> 01:25:30,789
Oh.
That's it, mate.

1189
01:25:31,878 --> 01:25:33,953
Scared us all for a minute.

1190
01:25:33,953 --> 01:25:36,609
Had to have extra attention,
didn't you?

1191
01:25:36,609 --> 01:25:38,644
Nice one, lovey, nice one.

1192
01:25:38,644 --> 01:25:40,262
Shit!

1193
01:25:40,262 --> 01:25:42,005
What are you doing, Marian?

1194
01:25:42,005 --> 01:25:44,953
You liar!
You told me he been in bed.

1195
01:25:44,953 --> 01:25:46,488
Shh! Drink your daiquiri.

1196
01:25:46,488 --> 01:25:48,107
I hate bloody daiquiri!

1197
01:25:48,107 --> 01:25:50,348
You don't.
You love bloody daiquiris.

1198
01:25:50,348 --> 01:25:53,918
Now I know why drag queens
drink from big glasses.

1199
01:25:53,918 --> 01:25:57,902
To make their hands look smaller!
Oh, ha ha, Marian!

1200
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:01,430
What do I tell the boy?
I've never been so embarrassed.

1201
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:02,966
You're overreacting.
Really?!

1202
01:26:02,966 --> 01:26:05,041
Yes. You're being a drama queen.

1203
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:08,818
You'd better drop that shit
if you're gonna be a good father.

1204
01:26:08,818 --> 01:26:11,806
And don't pretend to be surprised.
It's your turn.

1205
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:14,546
Not forever -
maybe just a couple of months.

1206
01:26:14,546 --> 01:26:16,123
Yeah, but why now?

1207
01:26:16,123 --> 01:26:18,905
Because I haven't had a holiday
in eight years.

1208
01:26:18,905 --> 01:26:21,300
I need a rest, Tick. I need space.

1209
01:26:22,515 --> 01:26:25,753
Reminds me of something I said not so long ago.
Well, I do.

1210
01:26:25,753 --> 01:26:28,409
It's time he knew his father anyway.

1211
01:26:28,409 --> 01:26:29,945
Yeah, that's the problem.

1212
01:26:29,945 --> 01:26:31,729
What do I tell him?

1213
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:34,137
What do you assume I do - lie?

1214
01:26:34,137 --> 01:26:36,586
Assumption's the mother
of all fuck-ups.

1215
01:26:36,586 --> 01:26:38,287
Don't bitch to me, bitch to him.

1216
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:41,274
You might be surprised.
Thanks for the free advice.

1217
01:26:49,523 --> 01:26:51,307
Who is it?

1218
01:26:51,307 --> 01:26:53,043
It's me, Bob.

1219
01:26:57,492 --> 01:26:59,235
Your flowers were being mangled.

1220
01:26:59,235 --> 01:27:01,631
Thought I'd rescue them for you.

1221
01:27:04,714 --> 01:27:07,075
Good idea. Thanks.

1222
01:27:16,502 --> 01:27:18,201
What's the matter?

1223
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:21,109
Nothing.

1224
01:27:25,135 --> 01:27:28,041
Know what your father does
for a living?

1225
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:29,618
Yeah.

1226
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:35,844
So I supposed you know he doesn't
really like girls then?

1227
01:27:35,844 --> 01:27:38,204
Does he have a boyfriend
at the moment?

1228
01:27:39,662 --> 01:27:41,240
No.

1229
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,817
Neither does Mum.

1230
01:27:42,817 --> 01:27:45,921
She had a girlfriend,
but she got over her.

1231
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:53,059
Do you complementary?
I've got Lego.

1232
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:55,889
Sure.

1233
01:28:01,454 --> 01:28:03,446
Come on, Butch. Get moving.

1234
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:05,936
We can't brand the cattle
by ourselves.

1235
01:28:05,936 --> 01:28:09,464
Great show last night.
You always end a number like that?

1236
01:28:09,464 --> 01:28:11,246
Always.

1237
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:15,898
How'd you like to pick her up
every night, Sundance?

1238
01:28:15,898 --> 01:28:17,433
Be a pleasure.

1239
01:28:17,433 --> 01:28:20,546
That might include
tucking the lady into bed, Jeff.

1240
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:22,248
What's the pay like, Marian?

1241
01:28:22,248 --> 01:28:24,655
He'll get himself into trouble
one day.

1242
01:28:24,655 --> 01:28:27,394
And you might just be
the lucky fellow.

1243
01:28:27,394 --> 01:28:28,972
Come on! All aboard!

1244
01:28:33,662 --> 01:28:35,406
Watch it with the innuendos.

1245
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:37,813
Give me a clear shot at this.

1246
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:41,632
You call dressing like a Xanadu
production number a clear shot?

1247
01:28:41,632 --> 01:28:43,956
Come on, Tick! Who's kidding who?

1248
01:28:43,956 --> 01:28:45,865
He sure as shit isn't.

1249
01:28:45,865 --> 01:28:48,769
<i>Sehd a ocopy to hmy awyer</i>

1250
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:51,709
<i>Gotta start a new life</i>

1251
01:28:52,879 --> 01:28:54,456
<i>You've been many things</i>

1252
01:28:54,456 --> 01:28:57,943
<i>But most of all
a good secretary to me...</i>

1253
01:28:57,943 --> 01:28:59,479
<i>Um, wave...</i>

1254
01:28:59,479 --> 01:29:01,595
What am I doing?
Swimming!

1255
01:29:01,595 --> 01:29:03,215
Um...

1256
01:29:03,215 --> 01:29:05,207
Murray.

1257
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:07,116
Rock...
Murray rock...

1258
01:29:07,116 --> 01:29:09,677
River rock... Oh, Rock! Rock Hudson!

1259
01:29:10,727 --> 01:29:13,134
Silly dag!
Didn't you get Doris Day?

1260
01:29:13,134 --> 01:29:16,534
My turn! My turn!
OK, smartypants, you try.

1261
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:19,111
Come on, then.

1262
01:29:19,111 --> 01:29:21,145
It's a...
Person.

1263
01:29:21,145 --> 01:29:22,681
A sexy woman.
Cat?

1264
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:24,217
Famous woman.

1265
01:29:24,217 --> 01:29:26,043
Um...
Oh, ah...

1266
01:29:26,043 --> 01:29:27,620
Baby.
Oh, ah, rocking.

1267
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,322
Oh, I know this one.

1268
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:31,854
Racehorse!
Cat. Scary cat.

1269
01:29:31,854 --> 01:29:33,472
Er, scary moose.

1270
01:29:33,472 --> 01:29:35,008
Scary dog?

1271
01:29:35,008 --> 01:29:36,710
I know, I know!
No?

1272
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:39,200
Oh, Lindy Chamberlain.

1273
01:29:40,777 --> 01:29:42,313
That was appalling, Benji.

1274
01:29:42,313 --> 01:29:44,389
Who taught you that?
Mum did.

1275
01:29:44,389 --> 01:29:46,464
Lies! All lies!
I thought so.

1276
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:48,829
Come on, Adam.

1277
01:29:48,829 --> 01:29:51,154
Up!

1278
01:29:51,154 --> 01:29:53,063
Time is against us.

1279
01:29:53,063 --> 01:29:55,259
And we have things to do.

1280
01:29:58,044 --> 01:30:00,119
Come on, you butch thing, you.

1281
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:01,904
No, no, count me out.

1282
01:30:01,904 --> 01:30:04,312
All for one...
Come on, Tick.

1283
01:30:04,312 --> 01:30:05,882
No.

1284
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:09,535
Hmm.

1285
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:12,097
Come on, Adam. Let's get frocked.

1286
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,576
So, uh...

1287
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:24,520
...er, what's it like
to finally have a father?

1288
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,219
It's OK.

1289
01:30:31,036 --> 01:30:32,987
I'm sorry about last night.

1290
01:30:32,987 --> 01:30:35,850
I don't always dress up
in women's clothes.

1291
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:38,956
I mean, you know,
don't get the wrong idea.

1292
01:30:40,126 --> 01:30:41,744
Um...

1293
01:30:41,744 --> 01:30:44,235
I do a lot of different stuff.

1294
01:30:44,235 --> 01:30:49,298
You know,
like... EIvis and Gary Glitter.

1295
01:30:49,298 --> 01:30:50,869
Abba?

1296
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:57,018
I'm not supposed to know
about the Abba show.

1297
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:59,509
But I'd really like to see it.

1298
01:30:59,509 --> 01:31:01,705
Would you do Abba for me?

1299
01:31:03,203 --> 01:31:04,903
Sure.

1300
01:31:10,217 --> 01:31:12,744
You know what I am, don't you?

1301
01:31:13,829 --> 01:31:16,520
Mum says you're the best
in the business.

1302
01:31:17,897 --> 01:31:21,544
Ah, well, your mother was always
prone to exaggeration.

1303
01:31:24,704 --> 01:31:27,808
Will you have a boyfriend
when we're in Sydney?

1304
01:31:32,133 --> 01:31:33,703
Maybe.

1305
01:31:35,536 --> 01:31:37,196
That's good.

1306
01:31:48,985 --> 01:31:51,392
Come on!
Where are we going?

1307
01:31:51,392 --> 01:31:53,871
To unleash the best in the business.

1308
01:32:01,561 --> 01:32:03,296
I had a dream.

1309
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:43,761
Well...

1310
01:33:43,761 --> 01:33:45,743
...we did it.

1311
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,198
It never ends, does it?

1312
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:50,898
All that space.

1313
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:58,329
So, what now?

1314
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:01,848
I think I want to go home.

1315
01:34:03,893 --> 01:34:05,545
Me too.

1316
01:34:07,006 --> 01:34:08,791
Well, then...

1317
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:12,556
...let's finish the shows
and go home.

1318
01:34:26,929 --> 01:34:29,420
Don't go without leaving me
your number, Sunshine.

1319
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:30,955
Already taken care of, Jeff.

1320
01:34:30,955 --> 01:34:33,570
It's at the bar end
of the men's cubicle -

1321
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:35,314
"For a good time, phone Felicia."

1322
01:34:35,314 --> 01:34:38,351
Can we stop at McDonald's?
Good idea.

1323
01:34:38,386 --> 01:34:40,551
I've had enough of this shitty food.
Fucking crayfish.

1324
01:34:40,586 --> 01:34:42,453
Where the hell do you start?

1325
01:34:42,453 --> 01:34:44,299
Lay it on the line, husband.

1326
01:34:44,299 --> 01:34:45,900
Don't conceal anything -
that's the key.

1327
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:49,113
If he doesn't like it, stiff
bickies, he can always come back.

1328
01:34:49,113 --> 01:34:51,637
What happens when people
hear about Mitzi's minor?

1329
01:34:51,637 --> 01:34:53,058
That's your problem, not his.

1330
01:34:53,058 --> 01:34:57,893
Morals are a choice. He'll decide
his own when he's ready.

1331
01:34:57,893 --> 01:35:00,383
Well, that's it. You're all packed.

1332
01:35:00,383 --> 01:35:04,036
You're joking?! Bernadette's shoes
aren't on board yet.

1333
01:35:04,036 --> 01:35:06,941
Hate to say this -
wish I was going with you.

1334
01:35:06,941 --> 01:35:09,017
Your gas tank will be fine.

1335
01:35:09,017 --> 01:35:11,092
Your axle... may be another matter.

1336
01:35:11,092 --> 01:35:13,789
The road will be filled
with bored mechanics

1337
01:35:13,789 --> 01:35:16,778
hoping some drag queens
will spirit them away.

1338
01:35:16,778 --> 01:35:19,185
We won't spirit gum at this rate.

1339
01:35:19,185 --> 01:35:21,463
Where the hell's Bernadette?
Here.

1340
01:35:23,461 --> 01:35:26,200
Come on, cabanossi tits.
Where are your bags?

1341
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,816
In my room.

1342
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:32,965
I'm not going.
I'm staying here for a while.

1343
01:35:32,965 --> 01:35:36,826
Oh, really? And you're choosing
to tell us about this now?

1344
01:35:36,826 --> 01:35:39,358
She told me a few weeks back.

1345
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:42,803
Somebody's got to handle the guest
entertainment while I'm away.

1346
01:35:42,803 --> 01:35:45,990
I get it.
Who's been playing hide the sausage?

1347
01:35:48,157 --> 01:35:50,274
Let's go before I throw up.

1348
01:35:50,274 --> 01:35:51,851
Come on, Benj.

1349
01:35:51,851 --> 01:35:53,636
Hope you can drive.

1350
01:35:53,636 --> 01:35:55,379
Hey, not without a hug!

1351
01:35:55,379 --> 01:35:57,162
Waaaa!
Waaaa!

1352
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:02,385
Are you sure?

1353
01:36:03,473 --> 01:36:05,125
No, I'm not sure.

1354
01:36:06,959 --> 01:36:10,064
I'll never know
unless I give it a shot.

1355
01:36:25,264 --> 01:36:27,376
I'm as jealous as all hell.

1356
01:36:29,455 --> 01:36:32,643
Shit! Raccoon time again.

1357
01:36:36,812 --> 01:36:39,178
Don't forget to write!
See ya!

1358
01:36:39,178 --> 01:36:40,713
Wish I was staying.

1359
01:36:40,713 --> 01:36:43,120
'Bye!
'Bye! Take care of her now!

1360
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:44,781
'Bye, Mum. 'Bye, Ralph!

1361
01:36:44,781 --> 01:36:46,815
Yeah, see ya, Ralph!

1362
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:53,993
<i>I've been cheated by you
since I don't know when</i>

1363
01:36:56,236 --> 01:37:01,253
<i>So I've made up my mind
it must come to an end</i>

1364
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:07,443
<i>Look at me now
Will I ever learn?</i>

1365
01:37:07,443 --> 01:37:09,269
<i>I don't know how</i>

1366
01:37:09,269 --> 01:37:12,632
<i>But I suddenly lose control</i>

1367
01:37:12,632 --> 01:37:15,949
<i>There's a fire within my soul</i>

1368
01:37:16,989 --> 01:37:20,393
<i>Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring</i>

1369
01:37:20,393 --> 01:37:23,713
<i>One more look
and I forget everything</i>

1370
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:25,416
<i>Whoa</i>

1371
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:28,528
<i>Mama mia
Here I go again</i>

1372
01:37:28,528 --> 01:37:32,223
<i>My, my, how can I resist you?</i>

1373
01:37:32,223 --> 01:37:35,501
<i>Mama mia
Does it show again</i>

1374
01:37:35,501 --> 01:37:38,905
<i>My, my, just how much I missed you?</i>

1375
01:37:38,905 --> 01:37:42,308
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

1376
01:37:42,308 --> 01:37:45,754
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

1377
01:37:45,754 --> 01:37:49,572
<i>Why, why
did I ever let you go?</i>

1378
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:52,976
<i>Mama mia
Now I really know</i>

1379
01:37:52,976 --> 01:37:56,410
<i>My, my,
I could never let you go...</i>

1380
01:38:03,476 --> 01:38:07,242
<i>I've been angry and sad
about things that you do</i>

1381
01:38:10,449 --> 01:38:14,593
<i>I can't count all the times
that I told you we're through</i>

1382
01:38:17,256 --> 01:38:20,909
<i>How can you go
when you slam the door?</i>

1383
01:38:20,909 --> 01:38:25,932
<i>I think you know
that you won't be away too long</i>

1384
01:38:25,932 --> 01:38:30,123
<i>You know that I'm not that strong</i>

1385
01:38:30,123 --> 01:38:33,610
<i>Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring</i>

1386
01:38:33,610 --> 01:38:37,179
<i>One more look
and I forget everything</i>

1387
01:38:37,179 --> 01:38:38,715
<i>Whoa</i>

1388
01:38:38,715 --> 01:38:42,036
<i>Mama mia
Here I go again</i>

1389
01:38:42,036 --> 01:38:45,397
<i>My, my, how can I resist you?</i>

1390
01:38:45,397 --> 01:38:48,926
<i>Mama mia
Does it show again</i>

1391
01:38:48,926 --> 01:38:52,287
<i>My, my,
just how much I missed you?</i>

1392
01:38:52,287 --> 01:38:55,774
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

1393
01:38:55,774 --> 01:38:59,094
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

1394
01:38:59,094 --> 01:39:02,872
<i>Why, why
did I ever let you go?</i>

1395
01:39:02,872 --> 01:39:06,234
<i>Mama mia
Now I really know</i>

1396
01:39:06,234 --> 01:39:09,881
<i>Why, why
I could never let you go.</i>

1397
01:39:28,315 --> 01:39:30,100
No, that's enough.

1398
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:32,175
Oh, my tits are falling down!

1399
01:39:33,753 --> 01:39:36,239
Oh, Jesus!

1400
01:39:36,274 --> 01:39:37,530
Thank you!

1401
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:39,978
Thank you. It's good to be home!

1402
01:39:58,941 --> 01:40:03,907
<i>Sometimes the snow
comes down in June</i>

1403
01:40:03,907 --> 01:40:08,930
<i>Sometimes the sun
goes round the moon</i>

1404
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:13,868
<i>I see the passion in your eyes</i>

1405
01:40:13,868 --> 01:40:18,891
<i>Sometimes it's all a big surprise</i>

1406
01:40:18,891 --> 01:40:24,411
<i>'Cause there was a time
when all I did was wish</i>

1407
01:40:24,411 --> 01:40:28,687
<i>You'd tell me this was love</i>

1408
01:40:28,687 --> 01:40:34,622
<i>It's not the way I hoped
or how I planned</i>

1409
01:40:34,622 --> 01:40:38,814
<i>But somehow it's enough</i>

1410
01:40:38,814 --> 01:40:43,961
<i>And now we're standing face to face</i>

1411
01:40:43,961 --> 01:40:48,610
<i>Isn't this world a crazy place?</i>

1412
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:53,631
<i>Just when I thought
our chance had passed</i>

1413
01:40:53,631 --> 01:41:00,313
<i>You go and save the best for last</i>

1414
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:10,774
<i>All of the nights you came to me</i>

1415
01:41:10,774 --> 01:41:15,672
<i>When some silly girl
had set you free</i>

1416
01:41:15,672 --> 01:41:20,693
<i>You wondered
how you'd make it through</i>

1417
01:41:20,693 --> 01:41:26,048
<i>I wondered what was wrong with you</i>

1418
01:41:26,048 --> 01:41:31,817
<i>'Cause how could you give your love
to someone else</i>

1419
01:41:31,817 --> 01:41:35,802
<i>And share your dreams with me?</i>

1420
01:41:35,802 --> 01:41:41,778
<i>Sometimes the very thing
you're looking for</i>

1421
01:41:41,778 --> 01:41:46,012
<i>Is the one thing you can't see</i>

1422
01:41:46,012 --> 01:41:50,786
<i>But now we're standing face to face</i>

1423
01:41:50,786 --> 01:41:56,016
<i>Isn't this world a crazy place?</i>

1424
01:41:56,016 --> 01:42:00,747
<i>Just when I thought
our chance had passed</i>

1425
01:42:00,747 --> 01:42:07,252
<i>You go and save the best for last</i>

1426
01:42:11,082 --> 01:42:15,979
<i>Sometimes the snow
comes down in June</i>

1427
01:42:15,979 --> 01:42:20,628
<i>Sometimes the sun
goes round the moon</i>

1428
01:42:20,628 --> 01:42:25,526
<i>Just when I thought
our chance had passed</i>

1429
01:42:25,526 --> 01:42:32,326
<i>You go and save the best for last</i>

1430
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:39,593
<i>You went and saved the best...</i>

1431
01:42:40,966 --> 01:42:45,689
<i>...for last</i>

1432
01:42:46,819 --> 01:42:50,963
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
