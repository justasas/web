1
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:09,042
RED DESERT

2
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,927
"Strike"

3
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,059
Romeo Salviati.
What are you doing in there?

4
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:58,768
You're not a manager.

5
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:01,938
You work to support your family!

6
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:06,024
Come out!
Join us out here!

7
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:11,070
Your wife's too ashamed of you
to leave the house!

8
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,570
Where did you buy it?

9
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,195
At the grocery stores,
at the crossroads.

10
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:07,615
I'll buy it.

11
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,241
But, I've started.

12
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:10,325
It doesn't matter.

13
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Take this.

14
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:26,463
Come, Valerio.

15
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,174
Want a bite?

16
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,085
The temperature's high, sir.

17
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,462
Lower the burners.

18
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:04,715
They have applicants,
but not for work abroad.

19
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:09,218
They went crazy finding specialized
workers for...

20
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,428
No. For a friend.

21
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:12,847
Send some of your men!

22
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:18,059
I'll try Beltrami, if you like.
I have to talk to him anyway.

23
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,977
Miss, can you call him for me?

24
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,145
Right away, sir.

25
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,734
Here's Beltrami. Who's this?
Oh, hi.

26
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:36,282
I wish I had some.

27
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:43,663
Ugo?
I apologize.

28
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:46,957
Are you crazy? No way!

29
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:51,085
This is a government agency.
No layoffs!

30
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:56,590
Nothing there either! I told you.

31
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,176
Take these...

32
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,181
they had special training...

33
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,600
for us. But...

34
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:13,938
They're good. This one,
for example, is a foreman.

35
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,942
What?
He's in Ferrara?

36
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:22,820
That's 50 miles away!

37
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:26,614
We'll go to Sicily if we have to.

38
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:34,461
There you are!

39
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,670
Meet a friend.

40
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:42,842
My wife.

41
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,310
Listen.
I'll wait for you in the office.

42
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:09,572
It was raining.
The road was wet.

43
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:13,742
She tried to stop.
She hasn't been driving long...

44
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:16,702
and she's so absentminded
when she drives.

45
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:19,497
Luckily, the truck stopped short.

46
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,289
Was she hurt?

47
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,458
No, not really.

48
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:26,001
Some contusion,
but mostly a shock.

49
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:28,337
A terrible shock.

50
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:31,172
After a month in the hospital,

51
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:34,050
she still isn't...

52
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:35,926
quite well.

53
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:38,470
Now she wants to open a shop,

54
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,555
no idea what for,

55
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:44,141
in via Alighieri.

56
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,269
Besides, it really doesn't look right.

57
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,562
Why?

58
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:09,620
Never mind those.
This is a hunting reservation.

59
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,169
My father put up those silos.

60
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:22,338
I don't see you in this work.

61
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,715
Didn't you study mining engineering?

62
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:34,598
I intended to go down,
but now it's up instead!

63
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,642
Such is life!

64
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,774
Since my father died...

65
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:51,445
the responsibility for the firm
is all mine.

66
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:54,406
Oh well.

67
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:13,847
Just a little...

68
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:19,226
Almost 98.

69
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,935
It's normal.

70
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,736
I dreamt...

71
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,781
that I was in bed
and the bed moved.

72
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,449
I looked.

73
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:41,076
It was on quicksand...

74
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,037
and sinking...

75
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,039
deeper and deeper.

76
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,071
Looking for me?

77
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:12,364
I was...

78
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:15,326
I was passing by,

79
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,952
and saw you go in.

80
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,249
It isn't true. I don't want
to start with a lie.

81
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,459
Start what?

82
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:28,711
Nothing...

83
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,504
to talk...

84
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:32,881
I'm sorry that...

85
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:46,683
I'd better use blue.

86
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:49,519
For what?

87
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:50,854
The walls...

88
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,358
and green for the ceiling.

89
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,028
They are neutral colors
that shouldn't disturb.

90
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,612
Disturb?

91
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,407
Yes, what I must sell.
The things.

92
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:11,787
What should I sell,
in your opinion?

93
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:13,955
You don't know?

94
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:19,085
I'd like ceramics.

95
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:22,087
But, I know nothing about them.

96
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:26,591
Faenza's close by.
It's famous for its ceramics.

97
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,636
Right, I'll write it down.

98
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,057
Write what?

99
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:39,309
To go there, to Faenza.

100
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:43,896
Good God! I have to make
all those calls.

101
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:07,999
Did Ugo tell you about me?

102
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,294
No. That is...

103
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:17,047
he said you have a child.
I knew he was married...

104
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:19,091
but not to whom.

105
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:21,926
That's all?

106
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:26,431
Yes, about the shop.

107
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:42,693
When did you get here?

108
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:43,944
This morning.

109
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:46,655
My bags are still in the car.
Why?

110
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:48,948
Did you find a room at the hotel?

111
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,867
No, but why do you worry?

112
00:23:56,996 --> 00:23:58,956
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

113
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:04,461
Do you live in Bologna?

114
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:11,759
No, I live in Milan,

115
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:16,429
but I was born in Trieste.

116
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:19,014
As a child,
I was taken...

117
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:20,849
to Bologna...

118
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,851
then to Milan.
Now, I've...

119
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,646
been in Bologna for some time,

120
00:24:28,396 --> 00:24:30,482
but, I'll have to leave.

121
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:32,191
A little complicated.

122
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:35,319
Why?

123
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:42,282
The truth is...

124
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,536
is that I...

125
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:51,374
I'm not happy
here or there,

126
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,419
so, I'm leaving.

127
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:58,837
Where to?

128
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,186
Do you leave the light on?

129
00:25:18,478 --> 00:25:20,188
Yes, it's better.

130
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:46,771
Today's paper!

131
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,423
Are you tired?

132
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:43,524
Giuliana, are you tired?

133
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:48,695
Yes, always.

134
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:51,364
No, not always. Sometimes.

135
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:00,205
Where are we going?

136
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:02,748
I don't know.
I thought you...

137
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,253
Good-bye!

138
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,589
Can I drive you?

139
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,302
Where are you going, now?

140
00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:19,970
I should go to Ferrara...

141
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,097
Right now?

142
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:26,100
Because now I must go home,

143
00:27:26,184 --> 00:27:28,602
but perhaps in the afternoon.

144
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:49,285
- Are these OK?
- No, no. I want some of those.

145
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:51,579
- But they cost more.
- It doesn't matter.

146
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:54,123
I prefer them
because they are alive.

147
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,332
All right.

148
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:11,137
Some fish are extraordinary.

149
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,390
Down deep, some are even transparent.

150
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:16,850
Did you know?

151
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:21,437
Don't tell me such things.
They scare me.

152
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:24,272
You can't imagine my fears!

153
00:28:31,736 --> 00:28:35,406
Do you have to love an animal to eat it?

154
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:38,032
Yes... perhaps.

155
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,909
For example?

156
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,453
I don't know.

157
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:42,995
A little chick...

158
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:46,123
kittens, perhaps...

159
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:49,500
those little, soft graceful ones?

160
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,169
Come on.

161
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,516
Would you eat me?

162
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:12,269
If I loved you.

163
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,069
Is Mario in?

164
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,865
Do you expect him?

165
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:33,410
In a while.
But, sometimes he's late.

166
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:36,038
May we wait?

167
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:38,581
Sure.

168
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,055
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

169
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,022
A little wine?

170
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,690
No, thanks.

171
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:12,109
Yes, I'd like some.

172
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:30,373
Be honest.
Did Ugo tell you...

173
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:33,084
about the accident?

174
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,669
Yes, yes.

175
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,379
It wasn't serious, was it?

176
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,008
You were hospitalized...

177
00:30:43,162 --> 00:30:44,579
for shock.

178
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,511
I met a girl...

179
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:05,804
Where?

180
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:09,474
In the hospital?

181
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,684
A very sick girl...

182
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,563
who wanted everything.

183
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:19,148
Meaning what?

184
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:24,819
The doctor said,
"You must learn to love."

185
00:31:25,153 --> 00:31:29,031
"Love someone or something..."

186
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:35,536
"your husband, your son,"

187
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:39,164
"a job, even a dog."

188
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:49,589
But not husband, son, job, dog,
tree, river.

189
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:54,468
Did she tell
what she was feeling?

190
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:04,142
The floor seemed to give way.

191
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:10,898
She had a feeling of sliding down
an incline...

192
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,984
of going down...

193
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:18,405
of being always about to drown...

194
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:22,908
with no one to help.

195
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:25,868
Not even her husband?

196
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:30,664
Not even her husband.

197
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:32,416
And he was away.

198
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,709
Not even her son?

199
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:36,752
The son... yes,

200
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:41,172
but that girl...

201
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:43,049
had no children.

202
00:32:45,884 --> 00:32:49,470
By the time she left the hospital,
she was asking herself,

203
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,764
"Who am I?"

204
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:55,017
She asked me...

205
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:57,477
to tell her.

206
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,479
Now she's well.

207
00:33:12,906 --> 00:33:14,949
Where does your husband work?

208
00:33:15,783 --> 00:33:18,620
At the Medicina radar.

209
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:24,999
Are you offering him a job?

210
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:32,130
Yes, a well-paid one.

211
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,967
Where?

212
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:44,348
If it's far away,

213
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:46,600
I'd leave things as they are.

214
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:49,101
And if it's not for long?

215
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:57,275
Once he had to go away to a funeral.
I nearly went mad with fear.

216
00:33:57,817 --> 00:34:00,361
If you wish, you could join him.

217
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:03,489
Does your wife do that?

218
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:16,958
Do you know what we'll do?

219
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,670
We'll go and talk to him in Medicina.

220
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:23,672
He won't refuse.

221
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,398
There he is.

222
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,582
- Hello.
- Hello.

223
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,335
- Oh, it's you.
- How are you?

224
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,087
All right?

225
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,923
I'm all right, and you?

226
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,802
I'm fine too, thank you.

227
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,599
He came to see you.

228
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:44,655
Tell me, please!

229
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:46,282
Yes?

230
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,959
Who owns these things?

231
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:02,754
The University of Bologna.

232
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:05,422
Aren't you scared?

233
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:08,133
No, I'm used to it.

234
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:11,427
What's it for?

235
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:16,348
They form an antenna
to listen to the stars.

236
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:17,808
May I listen?

237
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:19,767
You'd have to climb up.

238
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:23,270
You knew him and you didn't tell me?

239
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:24,896
No, I just met him.

240
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:26,356
The other one.

241
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:31,276
He was a neighbor.

242
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:35,238
What did he say?

243
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:36,447
Not interested,

244
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:39,117
unless I dazzle him with money.

245
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:40,617
What?

246
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:42,953
Bye, now.

247
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:58,549
What a pity!

248
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:07,889
Plant drainage has to go somewhere.

249
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:11,142
But, there's no more fishing.

250
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:14,228
We picked up a sandwich...

251
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:17,480
in Medicina, and a man...

252
00:38:17,522 --> 00:38:18,815
Do you remember?

253
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:23,277
He complained that his eel tasted
of crude oil.

254
00:38:40,623 --> 00:38:45,336
I haven't been here in two years.
It's falling apart.

255
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:59,348
At times, I feel as if I had
no right to be where I am.

256
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:02,850
That's why I keep moving.

257
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:25,284
Take my gloves.

258
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:27,828
I'm warm this way.

259
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:31,331
With all the shoes you have
you pick these worn ones?

260
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:37,795
Let's wait for them in the car.
We can run the heater.

261
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,719
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

262
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:09,612
Where were you the day
of Giuliana's accident?

263
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:11,446
In London. Why?

264
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:13,907
Did you return?

265
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:18,494
They said it wasn't necessary...

266
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:20,245
that I could.

267
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,540
Did Giuliana complain about it?

268
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:29,712
No, not at all.

269
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:32,255
Why do you ask then?

270
00:40:55,398 --> 00:40:59,610
The chimneys are smoking!
Is the strike over?

271
00:40:59,652 --> 00:41:01,737
No idea. I don't think so.

272
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:13,788
Are you a leftist or a rightist?

273
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:19,126
Why do you ask?
Are you interested in politics?

274
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:22,670
No. I was just wondering.

275
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:32,094
It's like asking what one believes in.

276
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:35,639
Those are big words.

277
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:38,266
The answer isn't easy.

278
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:42,269
After all...

279
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:46,314
what does one believe in?

280
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:50,276
In humanity...

281
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:52,569
in a way,

282
00:41:54,029 --> 00:41:56,280
in justice
a little less,

283
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:00,992
in progress
a little more.

284
00:42:07,373 --> 00:42:11,292
One believes in socialism...
perhaps.

285
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:16,630
What matter is to act in a way
one believes...

286
00:42:17,172 --> 00:42:20,008
right for oneself and for others.

287
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,844
With a clear conscience!

288
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:28,515
Mine is at peace.

289
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:33,143
Does this answer you?

290
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:41,275
A nice group of words!

291
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:43,860
There they are!

292
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:05,211
- Mr. Corrado Zeller.
- German?

293
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:08,088
No. My pedigree's clear!

294
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:11,632
Half of my name's German, too.
It's Max.

295
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:13,801
My wife.

296
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:15,719
- Nice to meet you.
- The pleasure is mine, ma'am.

297
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,761
How are you?

298
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,431
We've picked a bad spot.

299
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,223
It's my fault.

300
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,726
I knew it,
so I prepared...

301
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,562
some fish in my shack at the pier.
And that's fish from the sea.

302
00:44:10,722 --> 00:44:12,222
Let's go.

303
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:15,643
Let's go.
Where's Mili?

304
00:44:15,726 --> 00:44:17,352
She'll be there.

305
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:24,816
Are you coming?

306
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:38,619
What are you looking at?

307
00:45:18,442 --> 00:45:19,902
Come on.

308
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:23,405
You can trust me. I know these things.
These are quail eggs.

309
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:24,990
Yeah, sure.

310
00:45:25,865 --> 00:45:28,993
I should know.
I raise quails.

311
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:34,664
They contain an exciting substance.

312
00:45:35,623 --> 00:45:37,916
True, an aphrodisiac.

313
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,793
More than fertilized eggs.

314
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:41,003
More than what?

315
00:45:41,086 --> 00:45:43,337
What are you talking about?

316
00:45:43,546 --> 00:45:47,674
Where are you from?
Don't you know about them?

317
00:45:50,885 --> 00:45:52,720
Hatched eggs!

318
00:45:52,803 --> 00:45:55,514
There's a cure to be taken
from fall to spring.

319
00:45:55,556 --> 00:45:57,682
You drink them the ninth day...

320
00:45:57,724 --> 00:46:00,810
before the yolk turns into a chick.

321
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,853
I drank them...

322
00:46:02,936 --> 00:46:04,688
the monks gave them to me.

323
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,524
They had two dark spots.
I asked,

324
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:09,942
"What's that, Father?"

325
00:46:10,026 --> 00:46:11,443
"The eyes, my son."

326
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:14,404
"Swallow without looking!"

327
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:17,364
And you did!

328
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:20,200
I never touched your eggs.

329
00:46:20,284 --> 00:46:24,787
Milli, with or without eggs
you always have bedroom eyes!

330
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:46,888
Where's your Augusto?

331
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,598
- I dropped him.
- Since when?

332
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:52,684
I can't go to bed with a man
who earns less than I.

333
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,657
Do you know this game?

334
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,075
What game?

335
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,049
What do you feel?

336
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:34,218
Not much.

337
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:38,888
Do it to me!
I'll respond better!

338
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:46,478
Oh man, this is so good.

339
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:49,021
Don't get carried away, dear.

340
00:47:53,316 --> 00:47:54,317
What is it?

341
00:48:08,996 --> 00:48:11,081
What have you there?

342
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:30,513
- Do you feel it immediately?
- Immediately, she asks... Eat them all!

343
00:48:30,597 --> 00:48:33,056
No, come on.
It might be bad for her.

344
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:39,145
Would you bring me one?
You could have told us, Max!

345
00:48:39,228 --> 00:48:43,690
Be good. You're revving up
too fast anyhow. Switch on that radio.

346
00:48:47,026 --> 00:48:48,027
What do you feel?

347
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,695
Nothing yet.

348
00:48:51,946 --> 00:48:56,075
Too soon.
Give it a little time.

349
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:05,458
Boys, I'd hate to be wrong, but...

350
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:09,294
I really think...

351
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,561
I want to make love!

352
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:51,119
Let's drink to that, boys!
Come on, let's drink right now!

353
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:01,586
Oh man, I'm sorry.

354
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:18,599
- Excuse me.
- Don't worry.

355
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:31,235
Look who's here!

356
00:50:31,944 --> 00:50:35,989
Excuse me, Mr. Max. I had no idea.

357
00:50:36,406 --> 00:50:39,241
Never mind, Orlando, come in.

358
00:50:40,534 --> 00:50:42,035
Who's she?

359
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:45,663
Come in, Miss, come in!

360
00:50:53,335 --> 00:50:55,171
Some gal!

361
00:50:55,588 --> 00:50:59,507
Have a drink!
There, on the table!

362
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:02,968
He's one of my employees.
He works in my factory.

363
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:04,553
He's like a horse...

364
00:51:04,636 --> 00:51:08,014
he has a new girl every other day.
He's incredible.

365
00:51:08,806 --> 00:51:12,517
- What's the young lady's name?
- Iole.

366
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:15,145
Iole, like my boat.

367
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,272
We were talking of things you like, too.

368
00:51:18,856 --> 00:51:21,942
Didn't you tell me about that fat...

369
00:51:22,026 --> 00:51:23,568
What fat?

370
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,529
The one some Africans use...

371
00:51:26,988 --> 00:51:28,655
to last longer?

372
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:29,865
What is it?

373
00:51:30,782 --> 00:51:37,121
Oh that one. It's nothing,
just crocodile fat and spices...

374
00:51:37,205 --> 00:51:39,664
they apply before...

375
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:41,124
Apply where?

376
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,792
Milli, don't act dumb!

377
00:51:43,876 --> 00:51:46,587
It works for hours.

378
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,087
Did you hear that, Mili?

379
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,840
It works for hours!

380
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:54,843
I don't believe it.

381
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:56,386
It's true, it's true.

382
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,931
You have no idea what weird things
men do in some countries.

383
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:02,557
For example in Jordan, I saw men eat...

384
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:05,519
mutton fat and honey for breakfast.

385
00:52:05,852 --> 00:52:10,231
And the Chinese eat
ground rhinoceros horns!

386
00:52:10,314 --> 00:52:12,857
Shark fins are an energy booster.

387
00:52:12,941 --> 00:52:14,317
Let me tell you...

388
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,820
I've tried Royal Jelly.
And it works. Right, Linda?

389
00:52:17,861 --> 00:52:19,363
What's that?

390
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:20,823
The queen bee's honey!

391
00:52:20,906 --> 00:52:25,243
It's rejuvenating.
Remember it for your old age, Miss.

392
00:52:25,368 --> 00:52:27,661
If she still wants to make love!

393
00:52:27,702 --> 00:52:29,579
Did you hear? What do you say?

394
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:34,583
I like to do certain things,
not talk about them.

395
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:37,836
- Right!
- Why not?

396
00:52:37,877 --> 00:52:40,171
In a pinch,
why not talk?

397
00:52:40,255 --> 00:52:42,423
Because you're a pig!

398
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:49,503
It's cold in here, why?

399
00:53:49,836 --> 00:53:51,880
Aren't you cold?

400
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:54,256
Yes, I am.

401
00:54:05,682 --> 00:54:09,310
- Max, where's the wood?
- It's down there.

402
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:15,899
That's not enough!

403
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:18,359
I'll get some.

404
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,439
Look!

405
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:23,161
How come?

406
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:25,496
It might be for the fog.

407
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:32,169
It's stopping here.

408
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:39,382
Are any from South America?

409
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:42,469
Yes. But they're big ships,
they stop at the tower-island.

410
00:55:42,552 --> 00:55:46,764
I have an idea. Why not load
everything here instead of...

411
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:48,639
Naples or Genoa?

412
00:55:49,557 --> 00:55:52,518
It's quicker and I'll save money.

413
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:56,271
They go back empty, right?

414
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:02,777
Milli, if you're interested
that guy should be horny.

415
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,361
He hasn't seen a woman
in two months.

416
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:15,286
I liked that game,
do you know any other ones?

417
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:16,496
Lots!

418
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:18,330
Where did you learn them?

419
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:22,584
Just where do you think?

420
00:56:23,001 --> 00:56:24,752
You devil!

421
00:56:26,087 --> 00:56:27,421
I hate...

422
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:29,881
your husband.

423
00:56:30,507 --> 00:56:33,926
He's like a vulture,
ready to prey on...

424
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:37,763
a factory in bankruptcy
or upon a lone woman.

425
00:56:37,846 --> 00:56:39,180
You'll see...

426
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:42,892
one day, he'll get me, too.

427
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:58,404
They are usually tankers, right?
Not cargo ships.

428
00:56:58,487 --> 00:57:01,156
Probably,
but there's always a dry hold.

429
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,658
Here.

430
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:15,626
You know...

431
00:57:16,043 --> 00:57:19,587
it's true that I want to make love.

432
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:26,593
But, how can we?

433
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:32,473
Do you want to know a secret?
Never chase after deals.

434
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,808
I stand still,
they're the ones going around.

435
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:36,768
I am not chasing after anything.

436
00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:41,063
I go because I want to.

437
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:43,149
Because...

438
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:48,902
I think it's good to change one's life
and work.

439
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:52,448
Traveling makes sense...

440
00:57:53,823 --> 00:57:56,951
if one changes his entire environment.

441
00:57:57,034 --> 00:57:59,661
What's the use otherwise?

442
00:57:59,745 --> 00:58:01,913
I don't quite believe it.

443
00:58:11,046 --> 00:58:13,922
In two years I bought
and immediately resold two lots.

444
00:58:18,427 --> 00:58:20,344
- This shack...
- You're selling this one too?

445
00:58:20,428 --> 00:58:22,847
Sold already to that worker of mine
for small change.

446
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,682
I buy and sell fast!

447
00:58:26,683 --> 00:58:28,060
What are you doing?

448
00:58:28,393 --> 00:58:30,728
I'm freezing to death!

449
00:58:39,735 --> 00:58:41,528
Will you help me?

450
00:59:01,336 --> 00:59:04,463
Come on, boys, don't do that...

451
00:59:05,756 --> 00:59:07,216
Come on...

452
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:09,842
Move the fire, it'll catch better.

453
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:12,136
No, come on...

454
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:15,722
We're going to burn it all, yes.

455
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,601
- Who cares?
- Take this one.

456
00:59:25,814 --> 00:59:27,774
Stop, come on...

457
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:42,379
No, come on.
You're destroying everything.

458
00:59:49,092 --> 00:59:51,136
It's Orlando's...
It's quite new.

459
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:55,056
And this one?

460
01:00:42,886 --> 01:00:45,930
It's never still, never...

461
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,224
never, never.

462
01:00:50,183 --> 01:00:53,061
I can't look at the sea for long and...

463
01:00:53,979 --> 01:00:57,606
not lose interest
in what happened on land.

464
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:11,742
At times, I wonder...

465
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:15,954
if work is worth the effort
put into it.

466
01:01:16,496 --> 01:01:18,623
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

467
01:01:19,415 --> 01:01:22,334
My eyes are wet, I think.

468
01:01:28,464 --> 01:01:31,508
What should I use my eyes for?

469
01:01:34,052 --> 01:01:36,137
To look at what?

470
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:45,644
You wonder what to look at.

471
01:01:46,312 --> 01:01:49,272
I wonder how to live.

472
01:01:51,649 --> 01:01:53,484
Same thing.

473
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:34,770
The doctor!

474
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,647
He's coming for
the one who screamed.

475
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:37,397
What scream?

476
01:02:37,481 --> 01:02:38,941
I don't know,
someone was screaming before.

477
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:40,900
What scream?
The ship wasn't here yet!

478
01:02:40,983 --> 01:02:42,276
What do you mean
it wasn't here?

479
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:44,694
It arrived when you were taking care
of the fireplace.

480
01:02:44,778 --> 01:02:47,239
You're crazy,
it was here already!

481
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:52,201
Did you hear it?

482
01:02:52,284 --> 01:02:53,744
I don't know.

483
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:55,537
Are we kidding?

484
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,997
Perhaps you read it!

485
01:02:59,249 --> 01:03:00,541
Think so?

486
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,918
Perhaps.

487
01:03:05,753 --> 01:03:07,338
I heard it.

488
01:03:08,673 --> 01:03:11,174
Let's forget about it, please.

489
01:03:11,258 --> 01:03:12,926
What does it matter?

490
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:14,635
It matters!

491
01:03:14,677 --> 01:03:16,804
Someone yelled.
Linda didn't invent it.

492
01:03:17,513 --> 01:03:19,639
All right, Giuliana, you're right.

493
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:23,101
Don't say "yes" as if I were...

494
01:03:25,227 --> 01:03:30,106
Giuliana, who could have screamed?
There's only the sea!

495
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:34,068
Linda, why did you say "perhaps"?

496
01:03:35,402 --> 01:03:37,279
I did?

497
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:51,206
Damn!

498
01:04:02,215 --> 01:04:04,176
No doubts,
it's smallpox, cholera or leprosy!

499
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:06,510
Don't exaggerate!

500
01:04:06,594 --> 01:04:09,388
One or two flags for epidemics?

501
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:10,680
One.

502
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:14,100
Let's go.

503
01:04:14,808 --> 01:04:17,436
Please, Ugo, let's go!

504
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,188
Come on, it's probably a precaution.

505
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:23,107
- A case of colic!
- Let's wait for the doctor!

506
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:28,195
We do know him. You know him, too.
We'll ask me how come...

507
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:31,572
We won't ask a thing.
Where are my gloves?

508
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:35,700
Let's go.
Let's go.

509
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,078
Do you have my bag?

510
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:35,206
On the steps.

511
01:05:35,289 --> 01:05:36,707
I'll get it.

512
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,797
Don't go!
Forget it! I don't care!

513
01:05:44,548 --> 01:05:47,216
But, I have all my shots already.

514
01:05:47,299 --> 01:05:49,552
I don't want you to!

515
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,178
It's no risk.

516
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:54,055
I say no!

517
01:05:54,139 --> 01:05:57,724
Giuliana, come on.
Get into the car. I'll go.

518
01:06:20,451 --> 01:06:23,328
Corrado, wait. I'll go.

519
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:31,793
Let's go.

520
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:17,670
Forgive me, Ugo.
A mistake.

521
01:08:17,753 --> 01:08:21,631
Didn't you see the ship?
First you're scared, then...

522
01:08:21,715 --> 01:08:23,675
No, I didn't see it.

523
01:08:23,758 --> 01:08:26,218
All I wanted was...

524
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,429
to drive home.

525
01:08:28,512 --> 01:08:30,805
It was the fog,

526
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:33,057
and I made a mistake.

527
01:08:33,099 --> 01:08:34,684
I swear it, Ugo.

528
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:37,060
Why should you cry?

529
01:08:57,764 --> 01:08:59,683
That's nice!

530
01:09:03,603 --> 01:09:06,438
I'll pack. How long will you be gone?

531
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:07,647
Five or six days.

532
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:08,690
All right.

533
01:09:08,773 --> 01:09:11,191
Mommy, how much is one plus one?

534
01:09:11,775 --> 01:09:13,444
Two, of course!

535
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:15,487
No! Look.

536
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:16,905
Let's see.

537
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:22,451
Careful.

538
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:34,085
Now count!

539
01:09:35,295 --> 01:09:37,671
One! It's true!

540
01:09:38,214 --> 01:09:39,882
Look at that!

541
01:10:05,152 --> 01:10:09,447
While I'm away,
you can ask Linda to stay over.

542
01:10:11,615 --> 01:10:12,574
Why?

543
01:10:12,658 --> 01:10:16,244
So you're not alone
if you wake up at night.

544
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:20,665
Yes, yes.

545
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:23,583
I'll tell her.

546
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:30,464
Better not.

547
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:03,073
Like it?

548
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:05,992
See?

549
01:11:07,201 --> 01:11:08,411
You see...

550
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,667
how it turns!

551
01:11:22,422 --> 01:11:23,965
- Put it upright.
- Yes.

552
01:11:31,137 --> 01:11:32,930
Do you know why it stays up?

553
01:11:33,514 --> 01:11:36,266
- There's a gyroscope in it.
- What's a gyroscope?

554
01:11:36,349 --> 01:11:38,810
They put them on ships.

555
01:11:38,852 --> 01:11:41,021
To steady them on rough seas.

556
01:12:38,942 --> 01:12:54,496
Good-bye.

557
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:58,415
It's half the price
for men and equipment.

558
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:01,709
He'll go to Buenos Aires,
but that's fine.

559
01:13:08,632 --> 01:13:10,425
What do you take along?

560
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:16,596
Generators, trucks, pipes,

561
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,557
the factory equipment...

562
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,059
No, your things...

563
01:13:21,684 --> 01:13:23,519
your personal things.

564
01:13:23,602 --> 01:13:25,229
Nothing.

565
01:13:25,896 --> 01:13:27,730
Two or three bags.

566
01:13:32,151 --> 01:13:34,278
If I were to leave,

567
01:13:34,987 --> 01:13:36,821
I'd take everything.

568
01:13:38,364 --> 01:13:42,367
All I see and have...

569
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,619
at hand every day...

570
01:13:45,162 --> 01:13:46,954
even ashtrays.

571
01:13:47,663 --> 01:13:52,792
But then, why leave?

572
01:13:53,459 --> 01:13:54,419
You would only...

573
01:13:54,502 --> 01:13:57,713
miss everything... your street,
your city.

574
01:14:05,928 --> 01:14:08,138
When one reads ads...

575
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,307
"Cause Departure Selling"

576
01:14:10,348 --> 01:14:14,810
it seems an excuse
to abandon everything...

577
01:14:15,519 --> 01:14:17,729
or almost.

578
01:14:19,814 --> 01:14:22,816
Why? That shouldn't be!

579
01:14:30,823 --> 01:14:33,617
How do you know what you'll need?

580
01:14:34,701 --> 01:14:37,453
And then...
the things, the people,

581
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:40,039
will they be there when you return?

582
01:14:41,748 --> 01:14:44,209
Will they be the same?

583
01:14:44,334 --> 01:14:48,253
Perhaps...
I won't come back.

584
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:56,469
Were I to leave not to return,

585
01:14:57,219 --> 01:14:59,137
I'd take you, too.

586
01:14:59,638 --> 01:15:01,348
Because...

587
01:15:01,723 --> 01:15:03,432
you're part of me...

588
01:15:04,225 --> 01:15:06,477
of what I have around.

589
01:15:26,992 --> 01:15:30,704
Had Ugo looked at me the way you do,

590
01:15:31,163 --> 01:15:33,540
he'd have found out a lot.

591
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:43,881
About the accident?

592
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,556
And the girl in the hospital?

593
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:04,064
It was you!

594
01:16:09,026 --> 01:16:13,113
I was ashamed to admit it.

595
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:17,032
Not even Ugo knows.

596
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:22,954
The doctors promised not to tell.

597
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:26,875
I tried to kill myself.

598
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,503
Remember the Medicina worker?

599
01:16:33,629 --> 01:16:34,881
Yes.

600
01:16:38,467 --> 01:16:42,720
He was in the hospital with me...

601
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:45,514
and very sick.

602
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,891
Did he too...

603
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:50,977
try to die?

604
01:16:51,811 --> 01:16:53,312
Him? No.

605
01:16:53,353 --> 01:16:56,106
He must be well now.

606
01:17:12,285 --> 01:17:14,037
And how are you?

607
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:15,330
Fine.

608
01:17:45,562 --> 01:17:50,483
As you see, Patagonia is near
the South Pole.

609
01:17:51,025 --> 01:17:52,901
We get to Buenos Aires...

610
01:17:52,984 --> 01:17:57,363
then we fly to Commodoro Riva Davia.

611
01:17:57,613 --> 01:18:00,157
From there, in our trucks
some 300 miles inland...

612
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:02,992
from Cateta Olivia.

613
01:18:03,409 --> 01:18:04,744
And housing?

614
01:18:04,828 --> 01:18:07,122
- Who guarantees our wages?
- One at a time. One at a time.

615
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:10,332
What?

616
01:18:10,374 --> 01:18:11,750
And the housing?

617
01:18:11,834 --> 01:18:14,919
Prefabs with every comfort.

618
01:18:15,378 --> 01:18:18,004
How do we know
you'll pay up to the end?

619
01:18:18,088 --> 01:18:21,550
What about guarantees?
A deposit in a bank...

620
01:18:21,591 --> 01:18:22,925
or something?

621
01:18:23,008 --> 01:18:25,261
We'll discuss that, too, in a minute.

622
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:27,595
One thing at a time, be patient.

623
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:28,972
Is there a hospital?

624
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:33,016
Yes, well-equipped
and an Italian doctor, too.

625
01:18:33,058 --> 01:18:34,059
He's from Turin.

626
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:36,979
When can we send for our wives?

627
01:18:40,773 --> 01:18:45,277
After a year. But you can phone
once a month.

628
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,319
Who pays?

629
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:50,990
The company.
Unless you call more often...

630
01:18:51,073 --> 01:18:53,241
- And the sports newspapers?
- They're available.

631
01:18:54,409 --> 01:18:55,368
You'll get...

632
01:18:55,452 --> 01:18:56,995
all Italian newspapers...

633
01:18:57,078 --> 01:18:58,829
but a little late.

634
01:18:58,912 --> 01:19:00,205
Is there TV?

635
01:19:00,289 --> 01:19:03,541
Yes, sure, the TV.
You're there to work, not to watch TV.

636
01:19:06,461 --> 01:19:08,879
But if we have TV it's better, right?

637
01:19:11,381 --> 01:19:14,550
Do women there go bare-breasted?

638
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:17,719
Yeah, sure, you wish.
You'd really like that, wouldn't you?

639
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,766
He says he can't stand.
His legs.

640
01:20:15,808 --> 01:20:17,850
What is it?

641
01:20:20,937 --> 01:20:22,522
What happened?

642
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,190
What hurts?

643
01:20:25,607 --> 01:20:26,775
Here?

644
01:20:29,235 --> 01:20:30,820
Here then.

645
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:34,447
Here?

646
01:20:42,246 --> 01:20:43,746
Does that hurt?

647
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:45,790
I don't feel it.

648
01:20:47,874 --> 01:20:49,793
You don't feel it?

649
01:20:51,753 --> 01:20:53,796
If I do this?

650
01:20:59,175 --> 01:21:00,427
I know.

651
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:03,637
You don't want to go to kindergarten.

652
01:21:10,727 --> 01:21:13,145
Look, how pretty!

653
01:21:13,186 --> 01:21:16,815
Come see the nice ship!

654
01:21:17,649 --> 01:21:19,775
It's so big...

655
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:22,570
all white.

656
01:21:22,903 --> 01:21:24,612
Come...

657
01:21:26,197 --> 01:21:27,657
Come...

658
01:21:28,365 --> 01:21:30,075
Love...

659
01:21:30,701 --> 01:21:34,662
If you don't say what hurts,
what can I do?

660
01:21:37,707 --> 01:21:40,834
Tell me...
what hurts?

661
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:43,544
Madam, let me try to pick him up.

662
01:21:43,627 --> 01:21:45,504
Yes, try it.

663
01:21:46,297 --> 01:21:47,548
Here.

664
01:21:48,798 --> 01:21:51,092
Oh my God, you can't stand.

665
01:21:53,552 --> 01:21:56,638
Love, please tell me.

666
01:21:59,307 --> 01:22:02,018
How else can I help?

667
01:22:02,852 --> 01:22:04,311
Hold him up.

668
01:22:10,733 --> 01:22:12,818
It's not possible.

669
01:22:14,027 --> 01:22:15,487
Come here.

670
01:22:18,363 --> 01:22:19,656
Love,

671
01:22:21,825 --> 01:22:24,035
how did it start?

672
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,871
Tell me.

673
01:22:27,288 --> 01:22:29,748
You woke up this way?

674
01:22:29,915 --> 01:22:33,751
Or was it last night?
Tell me, love.

675
01:22:34,168 --> 01:22:36,003
A thermometer.

676
01:22:36,087 --> 01:22:37,963
Did he get his fourth polio shot?

677
01:22:38,047 --> 01:22:41,591
Sure, the doctor said so.

678
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:52,975
Then why 24 hours for the diagnosis?

679
01:22:53,059 --> 01:22:54,851
I won't wait.

680
01:22:55,102 --> 01:22:57,521
I can't wait that long.

681
01:22:57,604 --> 01:22:59,313
I'll call another doctor.

682
01:23:15,952 --> 01:23:18,787
I'm tired of this game.

683
01:23:35,175 --> 01:23:36,844
Draw me a new picture.

684
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:53,732
Why don't you tell me a story?

685
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:58,819
I've told you all those I know.

686
01:23:58,902 --> 01:24:01,488
Why not yesterday's?

687
01:24:03,115 --> 01:24:04,115
Which one?

688
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:06,325
About the kite.

689
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:17,293
Why not rest a little?

690
01:24:21,337 --> 01:24:23,756
I'll tell it later.

691
01:24:28,926 --> 01:24:31,971
Once there was a girl on an island.

692
01:24:32,347 --> 01:24:36,350
She was bored with grownups,
who scared her.

693
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:40,436
She didn't like boys,
all pretending to be grownups.

694
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:43,064
So, she was always alone,

695
01:24:48,942 --> 01:24:50,903
among the cormorants,

696
01:24:51,528 --> 01:24:53,405
the seagulls...

697
01:24:54,572 --> 01:24:56,741
and wild rabbits.

698
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:14,380
She had found a little isolated beach...

699
01:25:14,755 --> 01:25:17,424
where the sea was transparent...

700
01:25:17,591 --> 01:25:19,676
and the sand pink.

701
01:25:32,978 --> 01:25:35,480
She loved that spot.

702
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:39,149
Nature's colors were so lovely,

703
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:42,277
and there was no sound.

704
01:26:18,098 --> 01:26:19,265
She left...

705
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:22,727
when the sun went down.

706
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,217
One morning...

707
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,346
a boat appeared.

708
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:29,154
Not one of the usual boats,

709
01:27:30,072 --> 01:27:33,617
a real sailing ship...

710
01:27:35,993 --> 01:27:40,413
one of those that braved the seas
and the storms of this world.

711
01:27:40,997 --> 01:27:45,417
And, who knows...
of other worlds.

712
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:06,559
From afar, it looked splendid.

713
01:28:08,269 --> 01:28:12,564
As it approached,
it became mysterious.

714
01:28:13,315 --> 01:28:15,566
She saw no one aboard.

715
01:28:18,486 --> 01:28:21,071
It stopped a while...

716
01:28:21,405 --> 01:28:23,240
then veered...

717
01:28:23,782 --> 01:28:25,574
and sailed away...

718
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:29,786
silently,
just as it had come.

719
01:28:32,664 --> 01:28:35,582
She was used to people's strange ways...

720
01:28:35,624 --> 01:28:37,334
and was not surprised.

721
01:28:37,418 --> 01:28:41,629
But, no sooner back on shore...
there!

722
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:23,371
All right for one mystery,
but not two!

723
01:29:23,455 --> 01:29:24,414
Who was singing?

724
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,750
The beach was deserted.

725
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:30,293
But the voice was there...

726
01:29:30,793 --> 01:29:34,963
Now near.
Now far.

727
01:29:37,633 --> 01:29:41,135
Then it seemed to come
from the sea,

728
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:21,167
an inlet among the rocks,

729
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:24,295
many rocks that...

730
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:28,507
she had never realized,

731
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:32,969
looked like flesh.

732
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:36,763
And the voice...

733
01:30:37,806 --> 01:30:39,307
at that point...

734
01:30:40,599 --> 01:30:42,935
was so sweet.

735
01:30:43,435 --> 01:30:46,020
Who was singing?

736
01:30:46,396 --> 01:30:48,314
Everybody.

737
01:30:49,649 --> 01:30:51,191
Everything.

738
01:31:20,665 --> 01:31:24,627
Miss. Miss. Miss.

739
01:31:25,836 --> 01:31:27,630
The magazines.

740
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:17,837
But, then...

741
01:32:30,555 --> 01:32:32,306
Why...

742
01:32:32,598 --> 01:32:34,933
did you tell me...

743
01:33:51,369 --> 01:33:52,370
What's his room number?

744
01:33:52,454 --> 01:33:53,622
Pardon? Whose?

745
01:33:53,705 --> 01:33:55,206
What do you mean "whose"?

746
01:33:55,456 --> 01:33:57,249
Don't you remember the name?

747
01:33:57,792 --> 01:33:59,210
The name?

748
01:34:00,376 --> 01:34:03,588
The name...
The name, I don't...

749
01:34:11,969 --> 01:34:13,179
Corrado.

750
01:34:16,515 --> 01:34:19,934
The engineer, Mr. Zeller?
Room 309.

751
01:34:21,018 --> 01:34:23,437
First register, please!

752
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:52,377
Your son?

753
01:34:55,462 --> 01:34:57,214
He's fine.

754
01:34:58,132 --> 01:35:00,341
He doesn't need me.

755
01:35:01,008 --> 01:35:03,428
I need him.

756
01:35:03,511 --> 01:35:05,053
What is it?

757
01:35:07,806 --> 01:35:09,932
Everything hurts...
my hair,

758
01:35:10,599 --> 01:35:12,184
my eyes,

759
01:35:12,268 --> 01:35:15,603
my throat, my mouth...

760
01:35:17,564 --> 01:35:19,566
Am I shaking?

761
01:35:20,858 --> 01:35:22,484
A little. Perhaps it's the cold.

762
01:35:22,568 --> 01:35:24,486
Yes, I'm cold.

763
01:35:25,194 --> 01:35:26,779
So cold.

764
01:35:27,738 --> 01:35:29,532
I'm cold.

765
01:35:55,385 --> 01:35:57,512
You don't love me, do you?

766
01:36:08,188 --> 01:36:09,856
Why do you ask?

767
01:36:10,647 --> 01:36:12,983
I don't really know.

768
01:36:14,067 --> 01:36:16,110
I never get enough.

769
01:36:16,527 --> 01:36:19,822
Why do I always need other people?

770
01:36:22,032 --> 01:36:24,117
I must be stupid.

771
01:36:24,743 --> 01:36:27,369
That's why I don't make it.

772
01:36:34,793 --> 01:36:36,710
I'd like...

773
01:36:37,961 --> 01:36:41,130
all the people who ever loved me...

774
01:36:42,215 --> 01:36:44,801
here, around me...

775
01:36:44,884 --> 01:36:48,386
like a wall.

776
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:54,183
Giuliana, tell me what happened.

777
01:36:56,726 --> 01:36:58,228
Nothing.

778
01:36:59,437 --> 01:37:01,021
Just think...

779
01:37:02,523 --> 01:37:03,857
nothing!

780
01:37:21,788 --> 01:37:24,416
I'm not well.

781
01:37:26,125 --> 01:37:28,252
I'll never get well.

782
01:37:30,461 --> 01:37:31,712
Never.

783
01:37:54,481 --> 01:37:57,442
You think about it too much.

784
01:37:57,525 --> 01:38:00,153
It's a sickness like any other.

785
01:38:00,986 --> 01:38:03,280
We all suffer from it...

786
01:38:04,614 --> 01:38:05,990
more or less.

787
01:38:06,824 --> 01:38:08,951
We all need help.

788
01:38:55,696 --> 01:38:57,656
Who knows whether...

789
01:38:58,157 --> 01:39:03,370
somewhere in this world
one could be better off.

790
01:39:04,245 --> 01:39:05,829
Perhaps nowhere.

791
01:39:05,913 --> 01:39:07,915
You may be right.

792
01:39:07,998 --> 01:39:11,667
It's go, go, go, only to end up
back where we started.

793
01:39:12,585 --> 01:39:14,629
It's happening to me.

794
01:39:16,088 --> 01:39:18,840
I'm just as I was six years ago.

795
01:39:20,509 --> 01:39:22,343
Yet, I don't know...

796
01:39:23,386 --> 01:39:26,763
if this makes me want to leave or stay.

797
01:40:02,792 --> 01:40:04,335
When are you leaving?

798
01:40:04,419 --> 01:40:06,169
I don't know.

799
01:40:27,332 --> 01:40:28,750
- What are you looking at?
- There.

800
01:41:28,924 --> 01:41:31,133
At times, I'd like to assault someone.

801
01:41:32,676 --> 01:41:34,803
What's so bad about that?

802
01:41:34,887 --> 01:41:37,805
At times, I too...

803
01:41:51,441 --> 01:41:53,151
Help me.

804
01:41:54,069 --> 01:41:56,612
Help me, please.

805
01:41:59,365 --> 01:42:02,867
I'm afraid I won't make it.

806
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:07,663
I'm scared.

807
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:11,165
Calm down. What are you scared of?

808
01:42:12,792 --> 01:42:15,670
Of the streets,
of factories,

809
01:42:15,753 --> 01:42:19,297
of colors,
of people, of everything.

810
01:47:26,961 --> 01:47:31,422
Giuliana, what are you planning to do?

811
01:47:31,881 --> 01:47:32,965
Nothing.

812
01:47:33,048 --> 01:47:34,758
It's absurd.

813
01:47:35,008 --> 01:47:39,554
Don't worry about me. Everybody does...

814
01:47:39,637 --> 01:47:42,222
The doctors keep talking about me!

815
01:47:42,305 --> 01:47:44,015
But I feel sick...

816
01:47:44,099 --> 01:47:46,810
when I'm left alone.

817
01:47:47,601 --> 01:47:49,854
I can't take it any more!

818
01:47:56,568 --> 01:47:59,945
I've done everything...

819
01:48:02,197 --> 01:48:04,449
to "readjust to reality"...

820
01:48:05,575 --> 01:48:07,742
as they say in the hospital.

821
01:48:07,868 --> 01:48:09,703
It's seems I've succeeded, as I've...

822
01:48:11,079 --> 01:48:13,456
even managed...

823
01:48:13,956 --> 01:48:16,667
to be an unfaithful wife.

824
01:48:17,042 --> 01:48:19,878
Don't think that, Giuliana.

825
01:48:21,004 --> 01:48:24,590
Sure, just don't think.

826
01:48:25,466 --> 01:48:27,341
Fine solution!

827
01:48:32,846 --> 01:48:36,016
There's something terrible
about reality...

828
01:48:36,099 --> 01:48:38,184
and I don't know what.

829
01:48:40,936 --> 01:48:43,021
Nobody tells me.

830
01:48:47,483 --> 01:48:50,402
You haven't helped me either, Corrado.

831
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:37,543
Excuse me... tell me...

832
01:52:44,047 --> 01:52:48,009
I didn't want to.

833
01:52:50,511 --> 01:52:54,681
Does this ship take passengers?

834
01:52:59,727 --> 01:53:04,939
No, I really haven't decided yet.

835
01:53:27,624 --> 01:53:30,126
I can't decide.

836
01:53:30,835 --> 01:53:33,378
I'm not a single woman.

837
01:53:35,005 --> 01:53:38,300
But, at times,

838
01:53:38,632 --> 01:53:42,511
I feel...
separated.

839
01:53:42,928 --> 01:53:45,680
Not from my husband, no.

840
01:53:46,056 --> 01:53:50,184
The bodies... are... separated.

841
01:53:53,312 --> 01:53:55,146
If you pinch me,

842
01:53:55,897 --> 01:53:57,774
you don't suffer.

843
01:54:03,444 --> 01:54:05,446
What was I saying?

844
01:54:07,448 --> 01:54:08,740
Oh, yes.

845
01:54:08,823 --> 01:54:11,826
I have been sick, but...

846
01:54:13,078 --> 01:54:15,329
I must not think of it.

847
01:54:15,412 --> 01:54:16,622
That is...

848
01:54:17,539 --> 01:54:19,832
I have to think...

849
01:54:20,249 --> 01:54:22,794
that all that happens to me...

850
01:54:23,502 --> 01:54:25,420
is my life.

851
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,340
That's it!

852
01:54:29,382 --> 01:54:31,092
I'm sorry.

853
01:54:32,426 --> 01:54:33,760
Forgive me.

854
01:55:27,804 --> 01:55:34,100
Valerio!

855
01:55:34,142 --> 01:55:37,562
Let's go, Valerio.

856
01:55:46,193 --> 01:55:48,404
- Why is it doing that?
- I don't know.

857
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:06,293
Watch out.

858
01:56:15,592 --> 01:56:18,011
Why is that smoke yellow?

859
01:56:18,969 --> 01:56:21,555
Because it's poisonous.

860
01:56:24,599 --> 01:56:29,394
Then, if a little bird
flies through there, it dies!

861
01:56:30,604 --> 01:56:34,857
By now the little birds know.
They don't fly through there any more.

862
01:56:37,026 --> 01:56:38,027
Let's go.
