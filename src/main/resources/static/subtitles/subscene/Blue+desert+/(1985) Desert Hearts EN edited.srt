-I'll bring this for you.
-Thank you.

10
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,188
Professor Bell?

11
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,492
- Call me Vivian.
- Welcome to Reno.

12
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,429
I am down the street that way.

13
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:29,437
- Hi Frances.
- Hello, Burnett.

14
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:32,412
- I have space in my car.
- No, not such luck.

15
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:38,333
Well, looking forward
to some good desert living?

16
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,661
I'm looking forward to get these shoes of.

17
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:44,513
It's awful when your legs hurts.

18
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:47,217
It's a kindest thing
I've heard in three days.

19
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:51,306
- How long have you been married honey?
- 12 years.

20
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,523
Oh, no,no. we handle all that.

21
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:57,636
Quint, that's the lucky one.

22
00:02:58,036 --> 00:02:59,746
Sure could have used it  last night.

23
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,674
See you in six weeks, madam.

24
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:14,915
Soon as we are out of this place you
can tell me all about yourself.

25
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:23,716
I used to be a feature dancer in
that casino over there, 100 years ago.

26
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:29,639
You got any kids?

27
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,798
We were a professional couple.

28
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:40,366
My man was a professional too
he was a prominent attorney here in town.

29
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:45,224
- Went with a heart attack at 41.
- Sorry.

30
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:49,221
How long have you been alone?

31
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:52,427
I'm not alone, I got my boy with me.

32
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:57,728
My girl works right over
there at the Golden Ring.

33
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:03,669
She's got Glen's wild streak
running right thru her.

34
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,669
I have always lived in the city.

35
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:11,056
I Don't know what to do
with all this space.

36
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,165
I think of it as a God's backyard.

37
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:18,805
Just sit back and let
it clean out the impurities.

38
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,778
-And the heat?
-Lots of ice tea and no deep thinking.

39
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:25,813
I'll buy that.

40
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,372
Oh, brother!

41
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:43,000
-What are you doing at this hour?
- I have things to do.

42
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:47,407
-Professor Bell, Cay Rivvers.
-How do you do.

43
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,877
-Shall I call you professor?
-Vivian Bell.

44
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:58,222
Put that damned car forward!

45
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,568
Jesus!

46
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,736
Three guesses who that was.

47
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:09,857
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Sure don't.

48
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:13,351
Never would have guessed you smoked.

49
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:17,016
Can I be honest with you, Frances?

50
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:20,065
It's a dying art.
So be my guest.

51
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:26,872
Things are .. a little bit shaky
for me at the moment.

52
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:32,980
-Appreciate for sharing that.
-I really can't be part of the gang right now.

53
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,186
Just leave it to me.

54
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:40,562
Thanks.

55
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,410
Walter, we're here!

56
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:35,609
Walter, shake hands
with professor Vivian.

57
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:37,139
-Hi.
-Hello.

58
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:41,923
-You are younger than I expected.
-I'll take that as a compliment.

59
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:44,356
Get the bags, Walter.

60
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,027
You gonna love it here.

61
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:01,270
Well, here it is.

62
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:03,440
Nice, he?

63
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:07,460
It's lovely.

64
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:10,367
-Oh, Walter will take you to your room.
-Thank you.

65
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,112
-The bathroom is over there.
-Thank you.

66
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:29,381
What do you teach?

67
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,142
I teach English literature
at Columbia University.

68
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:35,996
116th Street, Broadway,
New York, New York.

69
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:45,803
I know you want me to hang around and
give you a history of the ranch.

70
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,678
How did you guess, Walter?

71
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:51,079
Why did I not stay in a hotel?

72
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,497
<i>Feel it burn .. and start to yearn</i>

73
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:21,532
<i>to hold you tight</i>

74
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,732
- Guess what, baby girl.
- What?

75
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,042
-I am engaged.
-OK

76
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:30,271
-He babe.

77
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:33,161
- Isn't that a pretty sight?
- Careful it don't blind.

78
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,069
And...

79
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,790
I'm not pregnant.

80
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,883
Joe and I are settling down.
You and Darrel should follow suit.

81
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:46,680
We could go away together on vacation.

82
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,844
Don't you know by now it doesn't happen with Darrel.

83
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,618
I am getting tired of defending your reputation.

84
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,605
I'm used to people talking behind my back.

85
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:57,612
But if you did not accept who I am..

86
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,318
that would really be tough.

87
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:04,568
Hey, you're the best.

88
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,630
And all the best people know it.

89
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:47,598
Thank you

90
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,129
Good luck. Thank you.

91
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:57,848
- Would you like to play that all, sir?
- Sherman.

92
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:00,118
All right Sherman, would
you like to play that all?

93
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,582
Oh I'll rather play you off,
honey.

94
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,494
Why don't you apologize to the lady, buddy.

95
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,563
-Apologize, man.
-Sorry.

96
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:15,819
That makes two of us.

97
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,905
-Thanks.
-You're okay?

98
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:19,307
Yeah.

99
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:42,214
- A cup of tea?
- Frances!

100
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:46,121
-Do you have any bourbon?
-Sure do.

101
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:49,050
Matter of fact, I'll join you.

102
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:52,129
Would not do you any harm to have several.

103
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,198
It's the weather.

104
00:11:57,238 --> 00:11:59,613
Oh get myself out.

105
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,357
You sound like Cay.

106
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:07,850
Locks herself in that cottage
and works until she drops.

107
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,724
-What is she working?
-She sculpts.

108
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,679
Oh, don't look at that stuff

109
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:23,787
A lot of sentimental junk.
I have no taste.

110
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:29,615
That is Glen, Cay's father.

111
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:32,664
I had Walter by him.

112
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:36,608
I'm not Cay's mother you know.

113
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,570
I'm her ...

114
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,823
I do not know what I am.

115
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,730
Not anything really.

116
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:50,303
A pair of hands and a familiar face.

117
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:53,704
Thank you

118
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,655
God, look at him.

119
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,463
Handsome as day is long.

120
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,495
And married.

121
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,428
I lived with him 10 years.

122
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:14,967
Maybe I didn't get a bridal
bouquet to add to my collection.

123
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,000
But I have what I wanted.

124
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,282
I had a love of my own.

125
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,445
That is a beautiful song.

126
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,710
You had more than
most people dare hope for.

127
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:35,509
Do not pay attention.

128
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,525
I'm just babbling.

129
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,680
I am a silly woman.

130
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,339
I don't think you are a silly woman, Frances.

131
00:14:13,348 --> 00:14:14,246
Hi.

132
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:20,302
You and me should make
a raisins and cream pie.

133
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,761
-I'm too depressed.
-In this air?

134
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,292
She'll be be fine when she's rid of that creep.

135
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:28,358
Larry is not a creep.

136
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:31,783
Any man who leaves a woman
for a model is a creep in my book.

137
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:34,860
I do not know which is worse.

138
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:37,323
A cheater or a hobby man.

139
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,004
At least you can share
a hobby, Lucille.

140
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:44,412
We would all like to
have a new past.

141
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,996
Good morning!

142
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,226
Good morning.

143
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,133
-I come down to stretch my legs.
-It's was about time.

144
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,041
What have you been doing in
that room for the last five days?

145
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,548
Whatever it is, it is too deep
for us to understand.

146
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:05,695
Come, sit down.
Join the girl talk.

147
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:08,163
We were discussing sex vs. marriage.

148
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:12,803
No, I'm not an expert in either category
so I'll excuse myself.

149
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:15,912
I heard that your culture types
go at it like banshees.

150
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,484
- Lucille!
- Is that true?

151
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:23,292
Actually banshees were folklore woman
wailing for the dead.

152
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,291
Perhaps you meant
to say "monkeys".

153
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:28,206
Hey!

154
00:15:30,215 --> 00:15:33,113
Well, I'll start with my pie.

155
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:37,369
Lucille, would you drop Cays' mail by the cottage?

156
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,466
I'll take it.

157
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,576
I'm going for a walk, anyway.

158
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:45,742
Just slip it under the door.

159
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:53,350
I mean you don't have to knock!

160
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,557
- Morning!
- Morning!

161
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,134
I was just passing by.

162
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,371
Thanks.

163
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,281
You want to come in?

164
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,857
-I'd love to but you're busy.
-Come in anyway.

165
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:52,044
To see if I can take it all
in one glance.

166
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:54,464
Have a look around.

167
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,962
I can't do it if you are watching me.

168
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,279
- Hi!
- Hi....!

169
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,039
Hello

170
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,840
-Where is Cay?
-I am here. You go back to sleep.

171
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,996
Sorry. I was not alone.

172
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:29,789
Fine. Socialization
was not what I had in mind, anyway.

173
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,908
You get all that traffic
with no equipment ...

174
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:45,637
beyond me.

175
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:15,366
-Where are you off to?
-Lawyers appointment.

176
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:17,974
No sense in taking two cars!

177
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:20,476
-I do not want to intrude.
-Will you bring her back?

178
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:23,473
Oh, don't worry about that.
Hop out, Gwen.

179
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:27,452
You have a car for today
and save me a trip.

180
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,051
Cay, drive like a lady.

181
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:37,266
Someone used it for an ashtray.
Come in up front.

182
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:46,439
Long time without seeing you, Mrs. Parker.

183
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:49,701
I'm handling it.

184
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,988
-Vivian, this is my friend, Gwen.
-From the cottage.

185
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:00,749
Yes, nice to see you again.

186
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:20,492
-Are you serious?
-About what?

187
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:23,710
Listening to this funeral music for one.

188
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:26,214
You know this piece, Vivian?

189
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:30,525
Yes, it is Prokofiev. A suite for
three oranges. Lovely, isn't it?

190
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:33,854
I better get to the record
store before they sell out.

191
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:37,339
Oh, come on, Gwen.
We all have a sensitive side.

192
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,246
I do not recall you
mentioning that last night.

193
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:59,588
-Thank you.
-Do you want me to wait?

194
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,900
I am sure you have better
things to do than wait for me.

195
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:03,642
Oh listen, I am sorry about the drive in.

196
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:07,147
You know why I am here for.
I don't need to understand your friends.

197
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,919
I'll leave the key here.

198
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:12,048
I have more important things to
think than how I'll go back.

199
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:14,495
Oh, but thanks anyway!

200
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:16,504
You're welcome.

201
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:25,114
Here is from the agreement,
Dr. Bell is walking off with the whole store.

202
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:27,226
I've always supported myself.

203
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:29,574
Other than my books
there's nothing I want.

204
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,411
-Is there a third party?

205
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:32,411
No

206
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:36,041
Rare women, walks out with no strings.

207
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,950
What are your grounds?

208
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,384
I have not practiced this.

209
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,763
Well we are not the
easiest folks to talk to.

210
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:53,670
-Are you enjoying the ranch?
-It's different.

211
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,313
One bunch of coops out there.

212
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,373
Mr. Warner, I'm 35 years old.
I want an honest life.

213
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,383
I am leaving a decent marriage
to see if I can find one.

214
00:21:03,498 --> 00:21:04,699
Not having children helps.

215
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,306
Although our careers served very
much the same purpose

216
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:10,213
binding us together for all those years.

217
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,653
We were very big on form.

218
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:16,770
Right friends, right prints on the wall.

219
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:23,928
I yearn for something we could not
analyze or reason away.

220
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,335
I want to be free of who I've been.

221
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:32,742
And your husband?

222
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:36,460
Martin would be content to have
me with him regardless of how I feel.

223
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,557
-He will not contest?
-No, no.

224
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,364
Well...

225
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:46,371
-We gotta go with mental cruelty.
-We've never treated each other with anything but....

226
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:49,279
No, No. It's just an umbrella term.

227
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:53,186
Nevada law prefers a headache or two

228
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:57,072
Sure he refused to
visit in-laws, sometimes.

229
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,501
Mr Warner, I may spend
the rest of my life alone...

230
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:04,908
I made a very difficult decision and
it was not based on a headache or two.

231
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,815
Martini time.
Would you have a drink with me?

232
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:15,803
Please, go on.

233
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:22,018
Well, the first thing I'm
obliged to advise my clients on

234
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:25,537
is not leave the state
once the residency is established.

235
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:29,444
A lot of folks leave for San Francisco
for a break.

236
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:31,351
Don't misunderstand me, Mr. Warner.

237
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,597
But hell that wouldn't apply in this case.

238
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:38,166
No. I trust we could leave the
keys with you any time.

239
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:43,273
Thank you.

240
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:49,580
Ok, put your stuff in here.

241
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:53,113
Be sure to lock it.
And the change room is right over there.

242
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:56,795
-Everybody. This is Joyce.
-Hi, Joy!

243
00:22:57,015 --> 00:23:00,640
I leave you here with the girls.
And I'll see you on the floor.

244
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:01,810
OK

245
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:08,048
Cay, I'll like to see you in my office
Please?

246
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,106
Darrel, where shall I put the key?

247
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:14,912
I'll tell you where to put it.

248
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,239
Thank you, Silver.

249
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:20,146
That was not very clever.

250
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,253
Cay.

251
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:38,381
Do you know how much I love you?

252
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:48,168
I started without warning to express
myself and just ruined it didn't I?

253
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,702
There's nothing to ruin, Darrel.

254
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:55,557
And I've been honest with you
about why.

255
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:57,725
I know the score.

256
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:00,780
I can look the other way if I have to.

257
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:23,879
Oh ..

258
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:27,685
-Excuse me.
-Frances is awake.

259
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:28,927
I just

260
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,055
thought I'd make myself a cup of tea.

261
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,201
Let me get it for you.

262
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:35,908
Don't bother.
I could use the practice.

263
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,399
Would you, please, go and
sit down?

264
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:44,722
If she hears us, we gonna
need an hour to get away.

265
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:49,630
I'll come back when it is less
complicated.

266
00:24:53,364 --> 00:24:54,371
Shit!

267
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:58,444
-What are you doing?
-Ssh

268
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,584
I'll clean up.

269
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,594
Look at my boots.

270
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,664
Please, don't turn the lights on

271
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:29,728
What's the matter?
You are having a rough night?

272
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,588
Yeah, you could say that.

273
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:37,414
Listen, I'm up all hours.

274
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,414
Next time you can't sleep,
come on by the cottage.

275
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:43,510
A little company beats counting
the flowers on the wall.

276
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,517
You are gonna make me cry.

277
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:50,424
No. I'm going to make you some tea.

278
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,226
Is it you, Cay?

279
00:25:56,964 --> 00:25:58,514
Yeah

280
00:25:58,816 --> 00:26:03,239
Bring me a coke, will you?
I got a glass.

281
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,146
-Who is in the kitchen?
-Vivian is making tea.

282
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:24,053
She is so nice. I swear ..

283
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:27,619
this whole place has gone
up a notch since she came.

284
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:33,868
I spend all night
struggling with migraine.

285
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,775
You are wearing that one
out, Frances.

286
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,553
No, everything is falling apart.

287
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:45,589
It is middle of the night.
It will be together by morning.

288
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:51,497
Ok...

289
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:54,270
What is falling apart?

290
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:56,997
The ranch, for one.

291
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:01,218
Business is so lousy. I won't
be able to hang on much longer.

292
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,796
Remember the good old days?

293
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:09,888
You can't bring back the good old days.

294
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:16,195
If I do sell, I want you to come with me.

295
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,351
I can't just picture us
in two rooms together.

296
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:22,043
Oh, It will be bigger than that.

297
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,517
If you come with me

298
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,655
You can quit the casino ..

299
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:29,626
and go to art school.

300
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,331
Button yourself up.

301
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:38,101
Professor does not need to
see your business popping through.

302
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:41,024
-Where is your pants?
-I gotta go.

303
00:27:41,155 --> 00:27:44,053
I'm not staying so don't squeeze.

304
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:48,750
You and Walter are all
that I've got left from Glen!

305
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,711
Glen is dead.

306
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,775
Not, if I still have you.

307
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:02,382
One of these days I'm gonna
meet somebody that counts.

308
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:07,673
Counts? With what you run around with?

309
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:10,234
I'm not asking you to be on my side.

310
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:12,134
But if you stand in my way ...

311
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,404
Now, go to sleep.

312
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,311
Don't empty out my ice box.

313
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,419
Good night.

314
00:29:11,944 --> 00:29:13,126
Good morning!

315
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:16,946
Good morning.

316
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:19,240
When was the last time you
were on a horse?

317
00:29:20,446 --> 00:29:22,203
To long ago for me to even remember.

318
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:24,755
Take off your reading
glasses and come out here.

319
00:29:45,031 --> 00:29:47,662
I did not know you painted, Frances.

320
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:50,569
The last supper.

321
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:55,677
Oh, oh looks like somebody didn't pack
riding clothes.

322
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,916
I thought my riding days were behind me.

323
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,291
Here. Try this to out for size.

324
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:03,200
He

325
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,198
Reserve a standing place at the mantle
for me.

326
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,106
Good times are hard in the end.

327
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:15,906
Sorry about the ride in
the other day.

328
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,920
I temporary lost my sense of humor.

329
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,827
It is awful to forget how to laugh.

330
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:23,935
I'm the one that gets by on laughs.

331
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:26,629
What you go through takes real courage.

332
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:29,142
You're the first person who said that.
Everyone else ...

333
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:33,720
Well, maybe, I am up to the risk.

334
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:37,356
Well there you go. Maybe some of your
gambling spirit will rob off on me.

335
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:41,182
I am sure that nobody accuses
you of playing it safe.

336
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:43,271
Only because they don't really know me.

337
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,911
There are so many things
I want to do but I am afraid to try.

338
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:49,086
You have ambitions?

339
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:50,606
I do all right here.

340
00:30:51,987 --> 00:30:54,293
But there's always another story
under the surface.

341
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:55,593
You know what I mean?

342
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:59,846
I am about to. My surface
is all but worn away.

343
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,007
Have you realized all your ambitions?

344
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,570
No. Just my plans.

345
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,346
What do you tell folks when they ask
you what went wrong with your marriage?

346
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:14,622
-I tell you it drowned in still waters.
-Say no more.

347
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:12,146
Hot sight, Joe.
Congratulations.

348
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:15,275
Congratulations? With $100
for the ring I need condolences.

349
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,344
-But the way her eyes are sparkling.
-Sparkling? Not sparkling. It is panic.

350
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:26,251
Give me a kiss to last the whole shift.

351
00:32:34,023 --> 00:32:35,222
Pervert.

352
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:38,327
-You got a date, Cay?
-No.

353
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:41,023
Pick up an extra steak, lover?

354
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,178
Hey!

355
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:51,506
I can not keep my hands off him.

356
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:54,606
And you invite me over to watch the show?

357
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,000
I want to find out...

358
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:59,238
why you?ve been walking around like
you swallowed the canary.

359
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:06,007
Joe is in the kitchen,
you are in the tub.

360
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:07,397
 I am happy.

361
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:11,715
Ok, now start talking.

362
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:16,162
-You'll gonna laugh.
-It must be serious.

363
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:21,088
I think I've found somebody
who counts.

364
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:24,436
From the beginning
and don't step over the good parts.

365
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:28,683
Well, she's an english professor

366
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:32,525
and she is 10 years older than I am.

367
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:36,753
Well, rock&roll!

368
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:38,979
It sounds a lot funnier than it is.

369
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:41,065
Is she out at the ranch?

370
00:33:42,074 --> 00:33:44,253
You promised not to mess around.

371
00:33:47,282 --> 00:33:48,984
Vivian Bell.

372
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,287
I just say her name
when I want to smile.

373
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:54,394
Did you sleep with her?

374
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:57,002
No. And I probably won't.

375
00:33:58,065 --> 00:34:01,509
-She wants you?
-It's not about that, Sil.

376
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:10,810
Remember that she will pick
up her decree and be gone.

377
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:14,483
Well. maybe by then...

378
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,329
I will figure out something in this
screwed up little life of mine.

379
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,231
I love your life, babe.

380
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:26,138
I would not want to be here without you.

381
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:32,250
Oh oh, you look like two desserts.

382
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:34,922
Take your part.

383
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:40,860
Sometimes I'd like to know what
it feels like to be a gorgeous woman.

384
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:44,154
-You want the ring back, honey?
-No.

385
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,174
Maybe I'll be reincarnated.

386
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:51,852
I'll go put the steaks on.

387
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:54,199
Joe.

388
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,096
I'm afraid that if it stays this good..

389
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:03,003
I'll find a way to screw it up.

390
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,211
Babe, don't I always
get you thru the good times?

391
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:22,118
-Did Cay behave herself the other day?
-She was absolutely charming.

392
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,025
-I would not be too won over by her.
-I do not understand.

393
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:36,933
Well its just ...
she does not have anything in common with...

394
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,000
a person of your caliber.

395
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:51,263
I've seen this movie. Good night.

396
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,309
You could not stay in there all day.

397
00:35:58,536 --> 00:35:59,725
I'll get some lunch.

398
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:01,562
See you.

399
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,469
Bye.

400
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:08,376
Will you give me one?

401
00:36:09,385 --> 00:36:10,483
No, no!

402
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:14,597
It's too big.

403
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,098
Take it on.

404
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:25,522
I was getting nowhere fast with my singing career.

405
00:36:25,688 --> 00:36:27,755
So I started to work in casino.

406
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:31,912
In the hope of being discovered.

407
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:35,550
-Who named you "Silver"?
-I did.

408
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:38,524
But she still answers to Silvia
when she is weary.

409
00:36:38,658 --> 00:36:42,091
I'll ignore that...
Catherine Anne.

410
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:44,541
Oh oh, here comes snake guy.

411
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,130
You are a hard one to track you down.

412
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,085
I heard your night was spent
running after Joyce.

413
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:53,464
You got it backwards for
a change.

414
00:36:53,966 --> 00:36:56,171
This is our friend, Vivian.

415
00:36:56,832 --> 00:36:58,608
-Whose friend?
-My friend.

416
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:02,840
-I am Darrel.
-How do you do.

417
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:04,985
You are probably doing better.

418
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:09,704
So, we are going to see you in
that new outfit you just bought?

419
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,162
Uh, I barely had the nerve to
buy it...

420
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:15,149
but Cay persuaded me
to throw caution through the wind.

421
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:19,000
That is what she is best at.

422
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:22,429
I think I am going to try my luck.

423
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:35,336
Whatever you set out to do,
you accomplished quite the opposite.

424
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:48,243
I say, Cay is stepping way out of
her range with that woman.

425
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:51,150
Do you want a tip?

426
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:55,000
Change your seat.

427
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:14,704
-Thank you for a really lovely day.
-You are welcome.

428
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:19,872
Good luck.

429
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:33,779
Ah, my back is killing me.

430
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:40,687
Yeah, I was on 6 tranquilizers
before I got here.

431
00:38:41,672 --> 00:38:43,794
The house, the kids,
Gale...all of it.

432
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:47,852
I am surprised you seem
so self assured.

433
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,606
Thank to Buck...

434
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,073
It's amazing what a little
"understanding" will do.

435
00:38:53,325 --> 00:38:56,223
I do. Cay and I are becoming
friends too, it does help.

436
00:38:57,402 --> 00:39:01,098
Not that it is any of my concern,
but you should think twice before

437
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:04,038
-you hang out with her.
-You are right, it's not your concern.

438
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:06,945
Did you know that she was
kicked out of College

439
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,952
for "unnatural acts" as they say?

440
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Shall I rise my
eyebrows and gasp?

441
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:16,538
Well, I am definitely out to lunch
when it comes to queers.

442
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:18,298
Aren?t you?

443
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:21,574
I don't think either of us would be
sorely missed, Lucille.

444
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:26,683
Well, nobody said that it
did not take all kinds, Vivian.

445
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,588
And you are certainly making
a unique contribution.

446
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:34,296
Hey Buck! Over here!

447
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,263
Are you winning?

448
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:05,939
Go away.

449
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,217
Yeah.

450
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,925
If you don't play,
you can't win.

451
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:30,532
Buck!

452
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:32,666
Come on.

453
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:33,647
Good luck.

454
00:40:33,655 --> 00:40:35,554
Enough here. Put your bet.
Come on.

455
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,461
Down the way. Get your bet.
Your time is my time.

456
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:47,973
Come here, darling.
Change my luck.

457
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:50,335
No, no. Really,
I don't know how to play this game.

458
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:53,640
Well, I know how to play it.
And I am down $200.

459
00:40:54,192 --> 00:40:56,929
You just give them a nice shake,
and roll them down.

460
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:59,000
Put them in the air now.
Let them go.

461
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And get 7.
Roll 7. Lets go.

462
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:06,812
That a winner!

463
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:09,719
That was beautiful, thank you!

464
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,626
Come at it again.
same lucky lady.

465
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:13,734
Let's go. Come on.

466
00:41:15,605 --> 00:41:18,832
Winner, winner!

467
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:21,739
Yeah, yeah again!

468
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:24,647
Winner. Lucky day.

469
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,316
This time blow.

470
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:30,263
Like this. And roll.
Roll 7.

471
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,171
2 and 2.
Not good. Sorry.

472
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:45,390
-I am sorry.
-You did real fine. Take it.

473
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:48,000
I can't take it.

474
00:41:48,001 --> 00:41:50,493
Sure you can.
Use it to get married.

475
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,800
Oh. Cash it in!

476
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:55,007
Cash it in ot not.
What's she gonna do?

477
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:57,614
Put your bet down.
Here we go.

478
00:42:47,363 --> 00:42:48,562
Well...

479
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:53,269
Pat's passing on an engagement
party tomorrow night.

480
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:57,676
I can't say I blame her.

481
00:42:58,648 --> 00:43:03,783
All she miss is a lot vulgar goings on,
drinking their heads of

482
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:09,865
I made your favorite, pancakes.

483
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:13,098
You won't like it in the middle of that ruckus.

484
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:14,205
I am not going.

485
00:43:15,014 --> 00:43:16,912
-Sensible.
-Why not?

486
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:21,427
I have lectures to prepare.
I have only week and half left.

487
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:23,727
Come on. Let your hair down for once.

488
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:26,402
Did Darrel put you off?

489
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:28,541
Beg your pardon.

490
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,985
Don't fuss. Eat your breakfast
and leave the woman alone.

491
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:35,100
It doesn't concern you,
Frances! Honest.

492
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:38,263
You are skating on thin ice, girl.

493
00:43:40,594 --> 00:43:42,368
I want you to come.

494
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:50,849
How can you resist such
a passionate request?

495
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:13,646
Vivian, are you Ok?

496
00:44:13,994 --> 00:44:15,092
Walk with me.

497
00:44:16,232 --> 00:44:19,800
I apologize for not stepping
in and taking your side.

498
00:44:24,126 --> 00:44:25,612
I sure wanted to.

499
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:29,606
-Would you do something for me now?
-Name it and it's yours.

500
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:31,985
You are a wise observer.

501
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:35,429
Why does your mother resent
Cay's friendliness towards me.

502
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:37,336
She wants Cay all to herself.

503
00:44:38,497 --> 00:44:40,932
Does she mind you and I spending time?

504
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:43,918
I don't believe but I'll inquire.

505
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,058
We are fated to be pals, Walter.

506
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:49,965
I felt that way since we first met.
Care for Chicklet?

507
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,872
I'd love one.

508
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,537
Based on what you said,
would you reconsider going tomorrow night?

509
00:44:59,826 --> 00:45:04,000
No. I don't think I'll be comfortable
celebrating with strangers.

510
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:07,594
Well, I am pretty sure Cay
can get me invited.

511
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:10,401
Are you asking me to be your
date, Walter?

512
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:13,092
Not exactly my date.

513
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:16,016
I know plenty of girls.
I just ask would you? That is all.

514
00:45:16,325 --> 00:45:19,223
How did you become
such a gentleman?

515
00:45:19,232 --> 00:45:21,130
The movies.

516
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,038
We'll make an odd couple.
I guarantee you that.

517
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:27,945
I don't care about stupid opinions.

518
00:45:38,993 --> 00:45:41,852
Folks, may I have your attention,
please?

519
00:45:42,861 --> 00:45:44,759
Quiet!

520
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:49,567
I want to welcome you
to this party of Joe Lorenzo.

521
00:45:50,676 --> 00:45:53,574
Special applause for our
star attraction. Miss Silver Dale.

522
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:04,226
You can stop clapping because
I plan to sing more than one.

523
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,388
I wrote this song last week and
I've been singing it everywhere.

524
00:46:12,246 --> 00:46:16,788
I wrote it ...  for everybody
that I love in this room.

525
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,403
Joe!

526
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:27,110
I am holding you of the ground
the whole time I'm singing this song.

527
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:32,803
Ok boys, let's hit it.

528
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,348
# I need to find someone
# that is mine.

529
00:46:46,508 --> 00:46:49,211
# I've been so lonely.

530
00:46:50,696 --> 00:46:54,123
# I've tried a few, wouldn't do.

531
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,599
# so lonely.

532
00:46:58,146 --> 00:47:02,554
# Now I'm hoping these days end ..

533
00:47:02,674 --> 00:47:05,471
# and better days begin ..

534
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:08,131
# I'm looking ..

535
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:12,276
# for someone to love.

536
00:47:14,075 --> 00:47:18,152
# I'll let a spark inside my heart.

537
00:47:18,324 --> 00:47:21,715
# the flame burns so bright ..

538
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:25,997
# As I feel it burn, I start to yearn ..

539
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,905
# to hold you tight.

540
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:36,441
# I know I gave no sign ..

541
00:47:36,589 --> 00:47:39,623
# you must have read my mind.

542
00:47:39,725 --> 00:47:42,435
# I am looking ..

543
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:46,707
# someone to love.

544
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:50,379
# Oh, I am looking ..

545
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,668
# for someone ..

546
00:47:52,715 --> 00:47:59,592
# to love.

547
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:03,000
I love you, Joe!

548
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:53,070
What are you dreaming about, old lady?

549
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:58,605
Glen and me used to go
dancing here.

550
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,484
I swear that if I was to turn around right now..

551
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,700
 it's like he would be standing right behind me.

552
00:49:06,064 --> 00:49:07,908
Why him and nobody else?

553
00:49:10,797 --> 00:49:13,375
 Because he reached in..

554
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:17,514
and put a sting of lights
around my heart.

555
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:26,089
Those days are good and gone.

556
00:49:26,315 --> 00:49:29,268
But you are still the best
dancer in town.

557
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:33,235
You better believe it.

558
00:49:37,438 --> 00:49:39,143
Thank you

559
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:41,899
Mrs. Parker, I am cutting in.

560
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:44,957
Why? You go right ahead.

561
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:17,864
So, .. why do you live at the ranch?

562
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,772
It is my hide out.

563
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,679
I know all about hide outs.

564
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,586
What are you hiding from?

565
00:50:26,895 --> 00:50:29,794
Anything I can't handle.

566
00:50:30,644 --> 00:50:32,901
Well, I am relieved to hear that.

567
00:50:36,486 --> 00:50:39,208
You know that I am not allowed
to go over State line?

568
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:42,538
I tell you what...

569
00:50:42,655 --> 00:50:45,991
If any rules get broken, I'll
take the blame, ok?

570
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:47,230
Ok.

571
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:50,000
Now, I'll tell you what...

572
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:54,844
I...would prefer that
none did.

573
00:50:56,064 --> 00:50:57,900
-Vivian.
-What?

574
00:50:57,939 --> 00:51:00,059
I believe that you are loaded.

575
00:51:01,762 --> 00:51:05,000
I could not imagine doing this
if I was not.

576
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,822
And what are you doing? Uh..

577
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,800
So, how long were you with Darrel?

578
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:03,286
Not long.

579
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,688
What happened?

580
00:52:06,814 --> 00:52:10,195
I allowed to myself to get attracted to
his attraction to me.

581
00:52:11,204 --> 00:52:14,102
-For him, that spelled love.
-And for you?

582
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:18,081
Let's put it this way. I didn't
exactly get the brass ring.

583
00:52:20,618 --> 00:52:23,917
-How do you get it?
-With a woman.

584
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,000
Are you trying to shock me?

585
00:52:27,705 --> 00:52:28,705
No.

586
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,732
I was only telling you the truth.

587
00:52:31,854 --> 00:52:34,000
Did I misled you in any way?

588
00:52:34,377 --> 00:52:36,203
Not for a minute.

589
00:52:36,328 --> 00:52:40,453
Because...you know I
care a lot about you Cay, but I...

590
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:04,361
Roll it all the way down.

591
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:54,126
You don't have to stop.

592
00:53:54,277 --> 00:53:56,175
I do.

593
00:54:08,184 --> 00:54:10,082
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

594
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:15,490
I don't know where that came from.
It's back where it belongs and I ..

595
00:54:17,675 --> 00:54:19,897
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

596
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:31,000
Take me back.

597
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,711
-I can't see a thing.
-I'll take my chances.

598
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:40,619
Just drive.

599
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:10,899
-Are you Ok?
-I guess.

600
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,517
Well...Looks like you two
got caught.

601
00:55:18,658 --> 00:55:21,275
We did a drive out to the
lake after the party.

602
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:25,069
Must have been quite a sight
to keep you out till now.

603
00:55:25,162 --> 00:55:26,300
Somebody is checking in?

604
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:29,562
No, somebody is checking out.

605
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,970
I made a reservation at
The Riverside.

606
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,877
Your bags are packed.

607
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,784
Like leaving the party would
cause concerns, Frances.

608
00:55:40,696 --> 00:55:44,791
It also caused talk.
Here is your refund check.

609
00:55:47,141 --> 00:55:49,657
-That was uncalled for.
-Oh, for God sake Frances!

610
00:55:49,782 --> 00:55:52,194
Don't you talk to me about God, girl!

611
00:55:52,257 --> 00:55:56,413
You made your point, Frances
Just as well. I would leave anyway.

612
00:55:56,822 --> 00:55:58,624
I'll never forgive you for this.

613
00:55:58,868 --> 00:56:01,079
I'll never forgive myself.

614
00:56:01,237 --> 00:56:05,902
Letting her come here with her books,
and her influence over my family.

615
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:08,042
Shut up, Frances!

616
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:13,260
I can't claim angels wings,

617
00:56:14,643 --> 00:56:16,557
but I am normal.

618
00:56:18,568 --> 00:56:20,964
Think... I was
proud to call you a friend.

619
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,671
May I tell you, the betrayal is mutual.

620
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:31,579
- I want to do that!
- Walter, bring them here!

621
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,486
Can't you find something
better to do?

622
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,191
Not since you came on the scene.

623
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:40,600
Get in the house.

624
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:43,055
NOW!

625
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,616
Can I go with you?

626
00:56:57,756 --> 00:56:59,311
I can't.

627
00:57:03,531 --> 00:57:05,929
I'll be at Silver's.
Will you call?

628
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,568
Let's go.

629
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:37,044
I guess the only way to
save my plants from your

630
00:57:38,053 --> 00:57:42,151
damn car's exhausts is to buy you a new one.

631
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,558
I am moving out, Frances.

632
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,466
- Why?
- To get your hands off my life!

633
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:53,863
You sound like your father.
Using my place to hang your hat.

634
00:57:54,034 --> 00:57:57,280
You want things without loving them!
That is greed!

635
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:02,000
Wasn't greed that took you in
when your mother left you.

636
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:06,095
It was not greed, that was
his sole comfort for 10 years!

637
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:09,002
There is a fancy word for
what you really were!

638
00:58:11,548 --> 00:58:16,561
It will be cold day in August
when I take in another educated cunt!

639
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,919
She meant something to me.

640
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:23,724
And you knew it.

641
00:58:25,303 --> 00:58:29,631
She'd broke your heart, the one I ever

642
00:58:31,568 --> 00:58:33,538
There is no reason to stay.

643
00:58:45,162 --> 00:58:47,256
# Put your sweet lips ..

644
00:58:47,365 --> 00:58:52,753
# a little closer to the phone.

645
00:58:54,462 --> 00:58:58,360
# Let's pretend, that we're together..

646
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,667
# all alone.

647
00:59:02,776 --> 00:59:05,675
# I'll tell the man to turn..

648
00:59:05,684 --> 00:59:09,982
# the jukebox way down low..

649
00:59:09,991 --> 00:59:11,889
Hello

650
00:59:12,053 --> 00:59:13,383
# And you can tell..

651
00:59:13,408 --> 00:59:15,144
# your friend there with you..

652
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:16,979
# he'll have to go.

653
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,796
-It's not complete.
-How is that possible?

654
00:59:20,446 --> 00:59:22,518
# Whisper to me..

655
00:59:23,013 --> 00:59:26,200
# tell me, do you love me true..

656
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,575
Sorry.

657
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,611
-Over for tonight?
-Yes, sure.

658
00:59:39,232 --> 00:59:40,529
Good night.

659
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,975
#...make up your mind, I got to know.

660
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,900
# Should I hang up..

661
00:59:49,042 --> 00:59:54,400
# or will you tell him he'll have to go?

662
00:59:55,561 --> 00:59:59,600
# You can't say the words I want to hear..

663
01:00:00,156 --> 01:00:03,951
# while you are with an other man..

664
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:09,000
# Do you want me? Answer yes or no..

665
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:12,769
# darling, I will understand.

666
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:15,624
# Put your sweet lips..

667
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:21,075
# a little closer to the phone.

668
01:00:22,347 --> 01:00:26,691
# Let's pretend that we are together..

669
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:30,498
# all alone.

670
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:32,865
# I'll tell the man...

671
01:00:33,115 --> 01:00:38,013
# to turn the jukebox way down low.

672
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:43,920
# And you can tell your friend
# there with you:

673
01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:51,927
# "She'll have to go."

674
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:55,734
Hello

675
01:01:57,371 --> 01:02:00,002
No, Mr. Warner, it was
a misunderstanding.

676
01:02:01,757 --> 01:02:04,849
No, thank you.
Accommodations are just fine here.

677
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:09,756
That will not be necessary, mr. Warner,
although I appreciate it.

678
01:02:10,465 --> 01:02:12,663
If you need to get in touch with
me, I'll be here.

679
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:15,894
Thank you. Good bye.

680
01:02:44,272 --> 01:02:45,678
Are you ok?

681
01:02:48,892 --> 01:02:50,685
I've been better.

682
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:53,293
Yeah, I know what you mean.

683
01:02:55,781 --> 01:02:58,200
Why did you come?

684
01:02:58,562 --> 01:03:01,507
I guess I am scared to death
of never seeing you again.

685
01:03:04,116 --> 01:03:07,214
Cay, you gotta let it go. You know that.

686
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:10,922
Stop it!

687
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:13,629
I want you to open the door!

688
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:17,736
- And I want you to leave me alone.
- I can't!

689
01:03:20,351 --> 01:03:21,843
Honest.

690
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:35,551
You look wonderful.

691
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:41,458
Are you kidding?

692
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:50,629
All right, Cay.

693
01:03:50,855 --> 01:03:53,272
We'll talk.

694
01:03:54,281 --> 01:03:56,180
You start.

695
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:04,087
You kissed me.

696
01:04:04,396 --> 01:04:05,994
And you kissed me.

697
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,476
And I kissed you.

698
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,811
I don't believe what I am saying.

699
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,716
You see...

700
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:18,940
I enjoy order.

701
01:04:23,315 --> 01:04:25,531
What happened between us...

702
01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:28,765
was innocent more than anything else.

703
01:04:28,897 --> 01:04:31,163
And friendly. Don't forget that one.

704
01:04:32,354 --> 01:04:36,082
I was really hoping that we can have
mature conversation about this.

705
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:39,910
So far we talked about order and
disorder and who kissed whom...

706
01:04:40,012 --> 01:04:44,067
and what the hell does it matter anyway,
since it was all so innocent and friendly.

707
01:04:44,705 --> 01:04:46,564
Than I'll get to damn point.

708
01:04:46,642 --> 01:04:48,881
I am a respected scholar.

709
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,789
I've been married many years to
respected scholar.

710
01:04:52,498 --> 01:04:55,872
And for a moments indiscretion,
a fleeing lapse in judgment, while I...

711
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:58,895
stood in the rain and allowed
Frances Parker...

712
01:04:59,015 --> 01:05:03,788
a figure bearing not the slightest resemblance
to anyone in my entire life experience,

713
01:05:03,919 --> 01:05:06,661
to humiliate us as we were pair
of delinquents.

714
01:05:07,027 --> 01:05:08,296
You should have told her off.

715
01:05:08,334 --> 01:05:10,232
I don't have a habit of rising my voice.

716
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,140
over false issues.

717
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,658
When I retire..

718
01:05:15,744 --> 01:05:18,603
I will simply write a short story
for my revenge..

719
01:05:18,759 --> 01:05:22,861
about this town, the
people, these gamblers...

720
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
My only clear memory is arriving.

721
01:05:32,155 --> 01:05:36,000
The rest is a blur.
An absolute blur.

722
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Oh, God!

723
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,000
What do you think you are doing?

724
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:01,914
Waiting for you.

725
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:14,305
I want you to put on
your clothes and leave.

726
01:06:14,856 --> 01:06:17,212
-No you don't.
-Yes I do.

727
01:06:20,221 --> 01:06:21,319
No you don't.

728
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:39,227
I, eh...

729
01:06:41,036 --> 01:06:43,934
I wouldn't know what to do.

730
01:06:44,545 --> 01:06:47,841
You can start by putting the
"Do Not Disturb" sign on the door.

731
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:04,448
Well..

732
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:08,656
that part went smoothly.

733
01:07:12,102 --> 01:07:14,263
Take your hands out of your
pockets and come here.

734
01:07:34,393 --> 01:07:37,814
I am not ... taking off my robe.

735
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,378
Well, everybody draws the line
somewhere.

736
01:08:54,639 --> 01:08:56,285
I don't usually..

737
01:09:01,294 --> 01:09:04,092
feel this way
at 11 o'clock in the morning.

738
01:09:08,613 --> 01:09:14,099
I don't know if I ever
felt this way before.

739
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:20,607
I am sorry.

740
01:12:44,817 --> 01:12:47,914
There goes the hot water.

741
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,821
Vivian.

742
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,328
We have to get out of here, you know.

743
01:13:07,495 --> 01:13:09,100
Stand up..

744
01:13:09,401 --> 01:13:12,450
-Take a walk..
-I adore you for this.

745
01:13:13,346 --> 01:13:16,357
have a coke
and go shop.

746
01:13:44,073 --> 01:13:46,265
Feel sorry then?

747
01:13:47,982 --> 01:13:51,172
-No, I feel exposed.
-Because of me?

748
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:54,379
And me.

749
01:13:57,088 --> 01:13:59,987
Do you know how beautiful you
are right now?

750
01:14:03,251 --> 01:14:05,894
I don't have any references for this.

751
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:08,801
-I am not great at it either.
-You had the experiences before.

752
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:12,421
Not this one.

753
01:14:12,884 --> 01:14:15,616
My life has always been so controlled.

754
01:14:16,556 --> 01:14:19,523
-And it will be again.
-Sure, of course.

755
01:14:20,142 --> 01:14:23,430
An affair, a divorce.
Nothing to break stripe up.

756
01:14:24,595 --> 01:14:27,639
-I love you.
-And affair with a 25 year old woman I might add.

757
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:28,842
I really do.

758
01:14:29,014 --> 01:14:32,152
I am sure the students and the
faculty will graciously acknowledge that...

759
01:14:32,952 --> 01:14:35,059
these things happen.

760
01:14:35,631 --> 01:14:38,500
Cay, I love you, too.

761
01:14:40,506 --> 01:14:42,168
Compliments of the boys.

762
01:14:48,547 --> 01:14:50,914
-Let's leave.
-Oh, just relax.

763
01:14:51,094 --> 01:14:53,688
-Check, please!
-We haven't had desert yet.

764
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,595
We'll get desert from room service.

765
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:02,503
Keep 'm, boys.
The night is still young.

766
01:15:04,564 --> 01:15:06,410
Bye, honey.

767
01:15:21,096 --> 01:15:23,000
Oh, come on, I am used to this.

768
01:15:23,326 --> 01:15:25,225
Well, I am not.

769
01:15:30,704 --> 01:15:34,132
Listen, you are just visiting
the way I live.

770
01:15:34,899 --> 01:15:38,308
It would suit you fine to hide in that
hotel room till your train leaves.

771
01:15:38,574 --> 01:15:41,000
By all means, let's hide.

772
01:15:41,457 --> 01:15:44,921
You are so insistent on
everyone perceiving things the way you do.

773
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,327
Oh yeah, I am making real
headway in that department.

774
01:15:47,421 --> 01:15:49,522
No fear, no confusion.
So self assured.

775
01:15:49,569 --> 01:15:51,362
I don't act that way to change the world,

776
01:15:51,386 --> 01:15:53,878
I act that way so the
goddamn world wont change me!

777
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
-Lower your voice!
-Why? Is this a false issue?

778
01:15:58,818 --> 01:16:01,500
Is there some way to make
this easier?

779
01:16:02,614 --> 01:16:04,000
Yeah

780
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,231
You take the car and I'll walk.

781
01:16:08,306 --> 01:16:10,204
And that is as easy as it gets.

782
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:18,000
Does it have to unravel this quickly?

783
01:16:18,413 --> 01:16:20,019
Comes with the territory.

784
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,259
-I'll walk!
-It's 12 miles, Vivian.

785
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,000
Good!
Maybe it will wake me up!

786
01:17:02,332 --> 01:17:05,927
# If your sweetheart, ..

787
01:17:07,114 --> 01:17:09,369
# sends a letter, ..

788
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:15,799
# of goodbye.

789
01:17:16,473 --> 01:17:19,006
# It's no secret, ..

790
01:17:19,762 --> 01:17:22,651
# you'll feel better, ..

791
01:17:23,299 --> 01:17:28,622
# if you cry.

792
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:31,504
# When waking, from a bad dream ..

793
01:17:31,671 --> 01:17:33,741
Do you need me the way I need you?

794
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,648
Yes. You know I do.

795
01:17:36,978 --> 01:17:37,978
# don't you ..

796
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:41,642
# sometimes think it's real...

797
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:13,309
Hi.

798
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:16,362
Sorry to be late.
Walter couldn't find a tie.

799
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,924
Oh, Silver, you are gorgeous.

800
01:18:27,798 --> 01:18:30,370
-Come on.
-How long will it last?

801
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:31,977
5 minutes

802
01:18:41,978 --> 01:18:44,690
-I am glad to see you, Walter.
-I am glad to see you.

803
01:18:46,565 --> 01:18:48,729
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

804
01:18:48,784 --> 01:18:50,502
Good morning to you all.

805
01:18:50,807 --> 01:18:52,226
Its Joe and Silvia.

806
01:18:52,522 --> 01:18:53,794
Silver!

807
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:57,813
Well, Joe and Silver, no Silvia,
where are you, nice people, from?

808
01:18:57,982 --> 01:19:01,001
-Brooklyn.
-Charlottesville, Texas.

809
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,628
That's where all the pretty girls are from.

810
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,859
At this time I call upon gentleman
upstairs for a special blessing for you.

811
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,917
-See me faint?
-I cried all the way through.

812
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:23,350
It was real nice of you to come.

813
01:19:23,707 --> 01:19:25,257
Cay is the best.

814
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,782
Don't say I've never
gave you anything.

815
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,979
- Have a good trip.
-I see you in New York.

816
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,086
Yes you will.

817
01:19:51,194 --> 01:19:54,000
Too bad things didn't
work out differently.

818
01:20:21,952 --> 01:20:24,733
Truth is that you don't
owe me one damn thing!

819
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,608
Got nothing left, hang
on to you with, any more.

820
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:31,000
I love you, Frances.

821
01:20:35,213 --> 01:20:37,422
I'll never accept what you do.

822
01:20:39,128 --> 01:20:40,430
I know.

823
01:20:43,893 --> 01:20:46,237
I just don't understand.

824
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,500
Women together!

825
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:52,051
She just reached in

826
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,459
put a string of lights
around my heart.

827
01:20:58,102 --> 01:20:59,300
Don't keep her waiting.

828
01:20:59,462 --> 01:21:02,773
Oh, Frances, be happy for
somebody once in your life.

829
01:21:12,365 --> 01:21:13,680
Oh, God!

830
01:21:14,584 --> 01:21:18,359
Look at us! Standing in
the middle of the street.

831
01:21:20,211 --> 01:21:22,995
Next thing you know they
be talking about me.

832
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:38,646
Is that it, then?

833
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:42,310
I have know you longer
than anybody in my life.

834
01:21:44,468 --> 01:21:45,917
Meaning?

835
01:21:46,773 --> 01:21:48,853
That it will never "be it".

836
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:24,931
Well, congratulations, Vivian.

837
01:22:25,536 --> 01:22:28,561
Like, you can head on back to
New York City a free woman.

838
01:22:28,884 --> 01:22:31,846
That is, of course, unless some
fellow here stole your heart.

839
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:36,701
-How about a drink, to celebrate?
-I'd love one. But I have other plans.

840
01:22:36,762 --> 01:22:38,660
I think I understand.

841
01:22:39,505 --> 01:22:41,000
You look different.

842
01:22:41,913 --> 01:22:43,593
I see, you have yourself a new pin pal.

843
01:22:43,788 --> 01:22:46,382
No, I have much more
than that, Mr. Warner.

844
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,289
Thank you.

845
01:22:51,036 --> 01:22:52,597
Good luck to you.

846
01:23:03,047 --> 01:23:04,944
Can I talk you into staying one more day?

847
01:23:05,062 --> 01:23:07,011
-Yes.
-Do you want me to?

848
01:23:07,461 --> 01:23:09,000
No.

849
01:23:10,822 --> 01:23:12,795
-I'll come back.
-When?

850
01:23:12,835 --> 01:23:14,000
Christmas.

851
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:16,117
Christmas?

852
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:19,000
-I don't know what you want.
-It's you I want.

853
01:23:34,556 --> 01:23:35,600
Cay?

854
01:23:36,464 --> 01:23:37,562
You are not coming?

855
01:23:38,387 --> 01:23:40,000
I'll see you at the station.

856
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,000
Can we have dinner?

857
01:23:43,328 --> 01:23:44,523
No.

858
01:23:44,866 --> 01:23:45,984
Why?

859
01:23:47,594 --> 01:23:49,918
Because being with you is starting to hurt.

860
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:56,826
I want...

861
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I want to say goodbye alone.

862
01:24:03,243 --> 01:24:05,640
We have been saying goodbye
from the beginning.

863
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:11,548
I gotta go.

864
01:25:29,476 --> 01:25:33,020
-I put sugar...
-I won't stir.

865
01:25:36,646 --> 01:25:39,462
-I got another postcard from Silver today.
-How are they?

866
01:25:39,971 --> 01:25:41,769
Aren't all honeymoon cards
the same?

867
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:46,601
"Incredible divine. Just like
a movie set. We'll never come back".

868
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,429
-Come with me.
-Oh, sure thing.

869
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,935
Can you just picture me with your set?

870
01:25:53,002 --> 01:25:55,898
If you want a sure thing, stay in Reno.

871
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:59,806
As for my friends ... I managed to
get thru an hour with .. ahem ..

872
01:26:00,962 --> 01:26:02,413
Gwen.

873
01:26:04,048 --> 01:26:06,620
It's a nice offer, Vivian.

874
01:26:06,998 --> 01:26:09,326
but there are still...a few loose ends...

875
01:26:09,412 --> 01:26:10,741
-To say the least.

876
01:26:10,842 --> 01:26:12,733
-Then, why did you make it?

877
01:26:12,873 --> 01:26:14,770
Because I care about you.

878
01:26:14,897 --> 01:26:18,156
Because I think that you
deserve to live somewhere with...

879
01:26:18,621 --> 01:26:23,064
or near .. someone who sees how
wonderful you are ...

880
01:26:23,574 --> 01:26:26,971
exactly who you are.

881
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,032
<font color="#ffff00">"All on board!"</font>

882
01:26:29,087 --> 01:26:32,000
That is why we'll never
finish this conversation.

883
01:26:37,294 --> 01:26:39,393
If it didn't please you, you
wouldn't have to stay.

884
01:26:42,402 --> 01:26:44,800
Yeah, we'll talk about it one of these days.

885
01:26:45,309 --> 01:26:47,507
Ride with me to the next station.

886
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:51,515
-What can we settle in 40 minutes?
-I'll talk fast.

887
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,500
Send me a postcard when you get there.

888
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
-What is it that you want?
-Another 40 minutes with you.
