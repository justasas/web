00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:21,020


1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
RED DESERT

2
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,947
"Strike"

3
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,081
Romeo Salviati.
What are you doing in there?

4
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:30,791
You're not a manager.

5
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,961
You work to support your family!

6
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:38,048
Come out!
Join us out here!

7
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:43,095
Your wife's too ashamed of you
to leave the house!

8
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:34,604
Where did you buy it?

9
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,231
At the grocery stores,
at the crossroads.

10
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,651
I'll buy it.

11
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,278
But, I've started.

12
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,362
It doesn't matter.

13
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:51,079
Take this.

14
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:58,503
Come, Valerio.

15
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:01,214
Want a bite?

16
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:30,154
The temperature's high, sir.

17
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:32,531
Lower the burners.

18
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:36,786
They have applicants,
but not for work abroad.

19
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:41,290
They went crazy finding specialized
workers for...

20
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:42,500
No. For a friend.

21
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,919
Send some of your men!

22
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:50,132
I'll try Beltrami, if you like.
I have to talk to him anyway.

23
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:52,051
Miss, can you call him for me?

24
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:53,219
Right away, sir.

25
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:59,809
Here's Beltrami. Who's this?
Oh, hi.

26
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,359
I wish I had some.

27
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:15,741
Ugo?
I apologize.

28
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,036
Are you crazy? No way!

29
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,165
This is a government agency.
No layoffs!

30
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:28,671
Nothing there either! I told you.

31
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:32,258
Take these...

32
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:38,264
they had special training...

33
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,683
for us. But...

34
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:46,021
They're good. This one,
for example, is a foreman.

35
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:52,027
What?
He's in Ferrara?

36
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:54,905
That's 50 miles away!

37
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:58,701
We'll go to Sicily if we have to.

38
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:06,560
There you are!

39
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:08,770
Meet a friend.

40
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:14,943
My wife.

41
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,414
Listen.
I'll wait for you in the office.

42
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:41,678
It was raining.
The road was wet.

43
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:45,849
She tried to stop.
She hasn't been driving long...

44
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,810
and she's so absentminded
when she drives.

45
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,605
Luckily, the truck stopped short.

46
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:53,398
Was she hurt?

47
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:55,567
No, not really.

48
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:58,111
Some contusion,
but mostly a shock.

49
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,447
A terrible shock.

50
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:03,283
After a month in the hospital,

51
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:06,161
she still isn't...

52
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:08,038
quite well.

53
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,582
Now she wants to open a shop,

54
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:13,668
no idea what for,

55
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:16,254
in via Alighieri.

56
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:20,383
Besides, it really doesn't look right.

57
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:21,676
Why?

58
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:41,738
Never mind those.
This is a hunting reservation.

59
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:51,289
My father put up those silos.

60
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:54,459
I don't see you in this work.

61
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,836
Didn't you study mining engineering?

62
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:06,721
I intended to go down,
but now it's up instead!

63
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:09,766
Such is life!

64
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:18,900
Since my father died...

65
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:23,571
the responsibility for the firm
is all mine.

66
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:26,533
Oh well.

67
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:46,041
Just a little...

68
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:51,421
Almost 98.

69
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,131
It's normal.

70
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:03,934
I dreamt...

71
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:07,979
that I was in bed
and the bed moved.

72
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:09,648
I looked.

73
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:13,276
It was on quicksand...

74
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:15,237
and sinking...

75
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:18,240
deeper and deeper.

76
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,300
Looking for me?

77
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,594
I was...

78
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:47,555
I was passing by,

79
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:50,183
and saw you go in.

80
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:56,481
It isn't true. I don't want
to start with a lie.

81
00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:58,691
Start what?

82
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,943
Nothing...

83
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:02,737
to talk...

84
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:05,114
I'm sorry that...

85
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,920
I'd better use blue.

86
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:21,756
For what?

87
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,090
The walls...

88
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:27,595
and green for the ceiling.

89
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:32,266
They are neutral colors
that shouldn't disturb.

90
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,851
Disturb?

91
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,647
Yes, what I must sell.
The things.

92
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,028
What should I sell,
in your opinion?

93
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:46,197
You don't know?

94
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:51,327
I'd like ceramics.

95
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:54,330
But, I know nothing about them.

96
00:21:55,373 --> 00:21:58,834
Faenza's close by.
It's famous for its ceramics.

97
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:02,880
Right, I'll write it down.

98
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:09,303
Write what?

99
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:11,555
To go there, to Faenza.

100
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:16,143
Good God! I have to make
all those calls.

101
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,251
Did Ugo tell you about me?

102
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:44,547
No. That is...

103
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,301
he said you have a child.
I knew he was married...

104
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:51,345
but not to whom.

105
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,181
That's all?

106
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,686
Yes, about the shop.

107
00:23:12,783 --> 00:23:14,952
When did you get here?

108
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:16,203
This morning.

109
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:18,914
My bags are still in the car.
Why?

110
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:21,208
Did you find a room at the hotel?

111
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,127
No, but why do you worry?

112
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,218
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

113
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,724
Do you live in Bologna?

114
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:44,022
No, I live in Milan,

115
00:23:44,898 --> 00:23:48,694
but I was born in Trieste.

116
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,280
As a child,
I was taken...

117
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,115
to Bologna...

118
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,118
then to Milan.
Now, I've...

119
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:59,913
been in Bologna for some time,

120
00:24:00,664 --> 00:24:02,749
but, I'll have to leave.

121
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,459
A little complicated.

122
00:24:06,003 --> 00:24:07,588
Why?

123
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:14,553
The truth is...

124
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,807
is that I...

125
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:23,645
I'm not happy
here or there,

126
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,692
so, I'm leaving.

127
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:31,111
Where to?

128
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,464
Do you leave the light on?

129
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,466
Yes, it's better.

130
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:19,034
Today's paper!

131
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,692
Are you tired?

132
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,799
Giuliana, are you tired?

133
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,970
Yes, always.

134
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:23,640
No, not always. Sometimes.

135
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,482
Where are we going?

136
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:35,026
I don't know.
I thought you...

137
00:26:40,073 --> 00:26:41,533
Good-bye!

138
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:43,868
Can I drive you?

139
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,583
Where are you going, now?

140
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,252
I should go to Ferrara...

141
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,379
Right now?

142
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:58,383
Because now I must go home,

143
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:00,885
but perhaps in the afternoon.

144
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:21,572
- Are these OK?
- No, no. I want some of those.

145
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:23,866
- But they cost more.
- It doesn't matter.

146
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,411
I prefer them
because they are alive.

147
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:27,620
All right.

148
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:43,428
Some fish are extraordinary.

149
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:47,682
Down deep, some are even transparent.

150
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:49,142
Did you know?

151
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,729
Don't tell me such things.
They scare me.

152
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:56,566
You can't imagine my fears!

153
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:07,702
Do you have to love an animal to eat it?

154
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:10,329
Yes... perhaps.

155
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:12,206
For example?

156
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:13,749
I don't know.

157
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,293
A little chick...

158
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:18,421
kittens, perhaps...

159
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:21,799
those little, soft graceful ones?

160
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:23,467
Come on.

161
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,819
Would you eat me?

162
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,572
If I loved you.

163
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:56,375
Is Mario in?

164
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:01,172
Do you expect him?

165
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:05,718
In a while.
But, sometimes he's late.

166
00:29:06,552 --> 00:29:08,345
May we wait?

167
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:10,890
Sure.

168
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:29,366
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

169
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:41,337
A little wine?

170
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,005
No, thanks.

171
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,423
Yes, I'd like some.

172
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:02,691
Be honest.
Did Ugo tell you...

173
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:05,402
about the accident?

174
00:30:06,236 --> 00:30:07,988
Yes, yes.

175
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,698
It wasn't serious, was it?

176
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:15,329
You were hospitalized...

177
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:16,914
for shock.

178
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,850
I met a girl...

179
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:38,143
Where?

180
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,813
In the hospital?

181
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:44,024
A very sick girl...

182
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:48,904
who wanted everything.

183
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:51,490
Meaning what?

184
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:57,162
The doctor said,
"You must learn to love."

185
00:30:57,496 --> 00:31:01,375
"Love someone or something..."

186
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:07,881
"your husband, your son,"

187
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:11,510
"a job, even a dog."

188
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:21,937
But not husband, son, job, dog,
tree, river.

189
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:26,817
Did she tell
what she was feeling?

190
00:31:34,324 --> 00:31:36,493
The floor seemed to give way.

191
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:43,250
She had a feeling of sliding down
an incline...

192
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,335
of going down...

193
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:50,757
of being always about to drown...

194
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:55,262
with no one to help.

195
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:58,223
Not even her husband?

196
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,019
Not even her husband.

197
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:04,771
And he was away.

198
00:32:04,854 --> 00:32:07,065
Not even her son?

199
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:09,109
The son... yes,

200
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,530
but that girl...

201
00:32:13,613 --> 00:32:15,407
had no children.

202
00:32:18,243 --> 00:32:21,830
By the time she left the hospital,
she was asking herself,

203
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:24,124
"Who am I?"

204
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,377
She asked me...

205
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:29,838
to tell her.

206
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:32,841
Now she's well.

207
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,313
Where does your husband work?

208
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:50,984
At the Medicina radar.

209
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:57,365
Are you offering him a job?

210
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:04,497
Yes, a well-paid one.

211
00:33:08,168 --> 00:33:09,335
Where?

212
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:16,718
If it's far away,

213
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:18,970
I'd leave things as they are.

214
00:33:19,512 --> 00:33:21,472
And if it's not for long?

215
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:29,647
Once he had to go away to a funeral.
I nearly went mad with fear.

216
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:32,734
If you wish, you could join him.

217
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:35,862
Does your wife do that?

218
00:33:48,082 --> 00:33:49,334
Do you know what we'll do?

219
00:33:51,544 --> 00:33:54,047
We'll go and talk to him in Medicina.

220
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,049
He won't refuse.

221
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:14,794
There he is.

222
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,981
- Hello.
- Hello.

223
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,736
- Oh, it's you.
- How are you?

224
00:35:42,238 --> 00:35:43,489
All right?

225
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,326
I'm all right, and you?

226
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:52,206
I'm fine too, thank you.

227
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,003
He came to see you.

228
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:17,064
Tell me, please!

229
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:18,691
Yes?

230
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:32,371
Who owns these things?

231
00:36:32,454 --> 00:36:35,165
The University of Bologna.

232
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:37,835
Aren't you scared?

233
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:40,546
No, I'm used to it.

234
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:43,841
What's it for?

235
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:48,762
They form an antenna
to listen to the stars.

236
00:36:48,846 --> 00:36:50,222
May I listen?

237
00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:52,182
You'd have to climb up.

238
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:55,686
You knew him and you didn't tell me?

239
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:57,312
No, I just met him.

240
00:36:57,396 --> 00:36:58,772
The other one.

241
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:03,694
He was a neighbor.

242
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:07,656
What did he say?

243
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:08,866
Not interested,

244
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:11,535
unless I dazzle him with money.

245
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,036
What?

246
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:15,372
Bye, now.

247
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:30,971
What a pity!

248
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:40,314
Plant drainage has to go somewhere.

249
00:37:40,397 --> 00:37:43,567
But, there's no more fishing.

250
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:46,653
We picked up a sandwich...

251
00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:49,906
in Medicina, and a man...

252
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:51,241
Do you remember?

253
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:55,704
He complained that his eel tasted
of crude oil.

254
00:38:13,054 --> 00:38:17,768
I haven't been here in two years.
It's falling apart.

255
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:31,781
At times, I feel as if I had
no right to be where I am.

256
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,285
That's why I keep moving.

257
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:57,724
Take my gloves.

258
00:38:57,807 --> 00:39:00,268
I'm warm this way.

259
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,772
With all the shoes you have
you pick these worn ones?

260
00:39:05,231 --> 00:39:10,236
Let's wait for them in the car.
We can run the heater.

261
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:20,163
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

262
00:39:39,098 --> 00:39:42,060
Where were you the day
of Giuliana's accident?

263
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:43,895
In London. Why?

264
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:46,356
Did you return?

265
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,944
They said it wasn't necessary...

266
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,695
that I could.

267
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:55,990
Did Giuliana complain about it?

268
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:02,163
No, not at all.

269
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:04,707
Why do you ask then?

270
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:32,068
The chimneys are smoking!
Is the strike over?

271
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,195
No idea. I don't think so.

272
00:40:43,746 --> 00:40:46,249
Are you a leftist or a rightist?

273
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:51,587
Why do you ask?
Are you interested in politics?

274
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:55,133
No. I was just wondering.

275
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:04,559
It's like asking what one believes in.

276
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:08,104
Those are big words.

277
00:41:08,271 --> 00:41:10,731
The answer isn't easy.

278
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:14,735
After all...

279
00:41:16,153 --> 00:41:18,781
what does one believe in?

280
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:22,743
In humanity...

281
00:41:23,244 --> 00:41:25,037
in a way,

282
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,749
in justice
a little less,

283
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:33,462
in progress
a little more.

284
00:41:39,844 --> 00:41:43,764
One believes in socialism...
perhaps.

285
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,103
What matter is to act in a way
one believes...

286
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:52,481
right for oneself and for others.

287
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:56,318
With a clear conscience!

288
00:41:57,695 --> 00:42:00,990
Mine is at peace.

289
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,619
Does this answer you?

290
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,752
A nice group of words!

291
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:16,338
There they are!

292
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,693
- Mr. Corrado Zeller.
- German?

293
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,571
No. My pedigree's clear!

294
00:42:40,654 --> 00:42:44,116
Half of my name's German, too.
It's Max.

295
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:46,285
My wife.

296
00:42:46,368 --> 00:42:48,203
- Nice to meet you.
- The pleasure is mine, ma'am.

297
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:49,246
How are you?

298
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,916
We've picked a bad spot.

299
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,709
It's my fault.

300
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:56,211
I knew it,
so I prepared...

301
00:42:56,253 --> 00:43:00,049
some fish in my shack at the pier.
And that's fish from the sea.

302
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:44,718
Let's go.

303
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:48,138
Let's go.
Where's Mili?

304
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:49,848
She'll be there.

305
00:43:56,104 --> 00:43:57,314
Are you coming?

306
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:11,119
What are you looking at?

307
00:44:50,951 --> 00:44:52,410
Come on.

308
00:44:52,494 --> 00:44:55,914
You can trust me. I know these things.
These are quail eggs.

309
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:57,499
Yeah, sure.

310
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:01,503
I should know.
I raise quails.

311
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:07,175
They contain an exciting substance.

312
00:45:08,134 --> 00:45:10,428
True, an aphrodisiac.

313
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:12,305
More than fertilized eggs.

314
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,515
More than what?

315
00:45:13,598 --> 00:45:15,850
What are you talking about?

316
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:20,188
Where are you from?
Don't you know about them?

317
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,235
Hatched eggs!

318
00:45:25,318 --> 00:45:28,029
There's a cure to be taken
from fall to spring.

319
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:30,198
You drink them the ninth day...

320
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,326
before the yolk turns into a chick.

321
00:45:33,576 --> 00:45:35,370
I drank them...

322
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:37,205
the monks gave them to me.

323
00:45:37,747 --> 00:45:41,042
They had two dark spots.
I asked,

324
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:42,460
"What's that, Father?"

325
00:45:42,544 --> 00:45:43,962
"The eyes, my son."

326
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:46,923
"Swallow without looking!"

327
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:49,884
And you did!

328
00:45:50,677 --> 00:45:52,721
I never touched your eggs.

329
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:57,308
Milli, with or without eggs
you always have bedroom eyes!

330
00:46:18,037 --> 00:46:19,414
Where's your Augusto?

331
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:21,124
- I dropped him.
- Since when?

332
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:25,211
I can't go to bed with a man
who earns less than I.

333
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,186
Do you know this game?

334
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,605
What game?

335
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:03,583
What do you feel?

336
00:47:05,626 --> 00:47:06,753
Not much.

337
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:11,424
Do it to me!
I'll respond better!

338
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:19,015
Oh man, this is so good.

339
00:47:19,057 --> 00:47:21,559
Don't get carried away, dear.

340
00:47:25,855 --> 00:47:26,856
What is it?

341
00:47:41,537 --> 00:47:43,623
What have you there?

342
00:47:58,554 --> 00:48:03,059
- Do you feel it immediately?
- Immediately, she asks... Eat them all!

343
00:48:03,142 --> 00:48:05,603
No, come on.
It might be bad for her.

344
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,692
Would you bring me one?
You could have told us, Max!

345
00:48:11,776 --> 00:48:16,238
Be good. You're revving up
too fast anyhow. Switch on that radio.

346
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:20,576
What do you feel?

347
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,244
Nothing yet.

348
00:48:24,497 --> 00:48:28,626
Too soon.
Give it a little time.

349
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:38,010
Boys, I'd hate to be wrong, but...

350
00:48:38,886 --> 00:48:41,847
I really think...

351
00:49:00,157 --> 00:49:03,118
I want to make love!

352
00:49:20,177 --> 00:49:23,681
Let's drink to that, boys!
Come on, let's drink right now!

353
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:34,149
Oh man, I'm sorry.

354
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:51,166
- Excuse me.
- Don't worry.

355
00:50:02,052 --> 00:50:03,804
Look who's here!

356
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:08,559
Excuse me, Mr. Max. I had no idea.

357
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:11,812
Never mind, Orlando, come in.

358
00:50:13,105 --> 00:50:14,606
Who's she?

359
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,235
Come in, Miss, come in!

360
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:27,744
Some gal!

361
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:32,082
Have a drink!
There, on the table!

362
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,544
He's one of my employees.
He works in my factory.

363
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:37,129
He's like a horse...

364
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:40,591
he has a new girl every other day.
He's incredible.

365
00:50:41,383 --> 00:50:45,095
- What's the young lady's name?
- Iole.

366
00:50:45,178 --> 00:50:47,723
Iole, like my boat.

367
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:50,851
We were talking of things you like, too.

368
00:50:51,435 --> 00:50:54,521
Didn't you tell me about that fat...

369
00:50:54,604 --> 00:50:56,148
What fat?

370
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,109
The one some Africans use...

371
00:50:59,568 --> 00:51:01,236
to last longer?

372
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,446
What is it?

373
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:09,703
Oh that one. It's nothing,
just crocodile fat and spices...

374
00:51:09,786 --> 00:51:12,247
they apply before...

375
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,707
Apply where?

376
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,376
Milli, don't act dumb!

377
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,171
It works for hours.

378
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:20,672
Did you hear that, Mili?

379
00:51:20,756 --> 00:51:23,425
It works for hours!

380
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:27,429
I don't believe it.

381
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:28,972
It's true, it's true.

382
00:51:29,055 --> 00:51:32,517
You have no idea what weird things
men do in some countries.

383
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:35,145
For example in Jordan, I saw men eat...

384
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:38,106
mutton fat and honey for breakfast.

385
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,819
And the Chinese eat
ground rhinoceros horns!

386
00:51:42,903 --> 00:51:45,447
Shark fins are an energy booster.

387
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,907
Let me tell you...

388
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:50,410
I've tried Royal Jelly.
And it works. Right, Linda?

389
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:51,953
What's that?

390
00:51:52,037 --> 00:51:53,413
The queen bee's honey!

391
00:51:53,496 --> 00:51:57,834
It's rejuvenating.
Remember it for your old age, Miss.

392
00:51:57,959 --> 00:52:00,253
If she still wants to make love!

393
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:02,172
Did you hear? What do you say?

394
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:07,177
I like to do certain things,
not talk about them.

395
00:52:08,136 --> 00:52:10,430
- Right!
- Why not?

396
00:52:10,472 --> 00:52:12,766
In a pinch,
why not talk?

397
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:15,018
Because you're a pig!

398
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,126
It's cold in here, why?

399
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,504
Aren't you cold?

400
00:53:24,629 --> 00:53:26,881
Yes, I am.

401
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:41,938
- Max, where's the wood?
- It's down there.

402
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,528
That's not enough!

403
00:53:48,611 --> 00:53:50,988
I'll get some.

404
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:38,077
Look!

405
00:54:54,844 --> 00:54:55,803
How come?

406
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:58,139
It might be for the fog.

407
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:04,812
It's stopping here.

408
00:55:09,817 --> 00:55:12,028
Are any from South America?

409
00:55:12,111 --> 00:55:15,114
Yes. But they're big ships,
they stop at the tower-island.

410
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:19,410
I have an idea. Why not load
everything here instead of...

411
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,287
Naples or Genoa?

412
00:55:22,204 --> 00:55:25,166
It's quicker and I'll save money.

413
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:28,919
They go back empty, right?

414
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:35,426
Milli, if you're interested
that guy should be horny.

415
00:55:35,509 --> 00:55:38,012
He hasn't seen a woman
in two months.

416
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:47,938
I liked that game,
do you know any other ones?

417
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:49,148
Lots!

418
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:50,983
Where did you learn them?

419
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:55,237
Just where do you think?

420
00:55:55,654 --> 00:55:57,406
You devil!

421
00:55:58,741 --> 00:56:00,075
I hate...

422
00:56:01,076 --> 00:56:02,536
your husband.

423
00:56:03,162 --> 00:56:06,582
He's like a vulture,
ready to prey on...

424
00:56:06,624 --> 00:56:10,419
a factory in bankruptcy
or upon a lone woman.

425
00:56:10,502 --> 00:56:11,837
You'll see...

426
00:56:12,296 --> 00:56:15,549
one day, he'll get me, too.

427
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:31,065
They are usually tankers, right?
Not cargo ships.

428
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:33,817
Probably,
but there's always a dry hold.

429
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:35,319
Here.

430
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,290
You know...

431
00:56:48,707 --> 00:56:52,252
it's true that I want to make love.

432
00:56:57,174 --> 00:56:59,259
But, how can we?

433
00:57:01,428 --> 00:57:05,140
Do you want to know a secret?
Never chase after deals.

434
00:57:05,182 --> 00:57:07,476
I stand still,
they're the ones going around.

435
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,436
I am not chasing after anything.

436
00:57:11,688 --> 00:57:13,732
I go because I want to.

437
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,817
Because...

438
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:21,573
I think it's good to change one's life
and work.

439
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:25,118
Traveling makes sense...

440
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:29,623
if one changes his entire environment.

441
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:32,334
What's the use otherwise?

442
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:34,586
I don't quite believe it.

443
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,598
In two years I bought
and immediately resold two lots.

444
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,021
- This shack...
- You're selling this one too?

445
00:57:53,105 --> 00:57:55,524
Sold already to that worker of mine
for small change.

446
00:57:55,607 --> 00:57:58,360
I buy and sell fast!

447
00:57:59,361 --> 00:58:00,737
What are you doing?

448
00:58:01,071 --> 00:58:03,406
I'm freezing to death!

449
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:14,209
Will you help me?

450
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,148
Come on, boys, don't do that...

451
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:39,901
Come on...

452
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:42,529
Move the fire, it'll catch better.

453
00:58:42,612 --> 00:58:44,823
No, come on...

454
00:58:46,032 --> 00:58:48,410
We're going to burn it all, yes.

455
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:53,290
- Who cares?
- Take this one.

456
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:00,463
Stop, come on...

457
00:59:12,726 --> 00:59:15,061
No, come on.
You're destroying everything.

458
00:59:21,776 --> 00:59:23,820
It's Orlando's...
It's quite new.

459
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:27,740
And this one?

460
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,624
It's never still, never...

461
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,918
never, never.

462
01:00:22,879 --> 01:00:25,757
I can't look at the sea for long and...

463
01:00:26,674 --> 01:00:30,303
not lose interest
in what happened on land.

464
01:00:41,147 --> 01:00:44,442
At times, I wonder...

465
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:48,654
if work is worth the effort
put into it.

466
01:00:49,197 --> 01:00:51,324
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

467
01:00:52,116 --> 01:00:55,036
My eyes are wet, I think.

468
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:04,212
What should I use my eyes for?

469
01:01:06,756 --> 01:01:08,841
To look at what?

470
01:01:15,014 --> 01:01:18,351
You wonder what to look at.

471
01:01:19,018 --> 01:01:21,979
I wonder how to live.

472
01:01:24,357 --> 01:01:26,192
Same thing.

473
01:02:05,898 --> 01:02:07,483
The doctor!

474
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:09,360
He's coming for
the one who screamed.

475
01:02:09,443 --> 01:02:10,110
What scream?

476
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:11,654
I don't know,
someone was screaming before.

477
01:02:11,737 --> 01:02:13,614
What scream?
The ship wasn't here yet!

478
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:14,990
What do you mean
it wasn't here?

479
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:17,409
It arrived when you were taking care
of the fireplace.

480
01:02:17,493 --> 01:02:19,954
You're crazy,
it was here already!

481
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:24,917
Did you hear it?

482
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,460
I don't know.

483
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:28,254
Are we kidding?

484
01:02:28,337 --> 01:02:30,714
Perhaps you read it!

485
01:02:31,966 --> 01:02:33,259
Think so?

486
01:02:34,093 --> 01:02:35,636
Perhaps.

487
01:02:38,472 --> 01:02:40,057
I heard it.

488
01:02:41,392 --> 01:02:43,894
Let's forget about it, please.

489
01:02:43,978 --> 01:02:45,646
What does it matter?

490
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:47,356
It matters!

491
01:02:47,398 --> 01:02:49,525
Someone yelled.
Linda didn't invent it.

492
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:52,361
All right, Giuliana, you're right.

493
01:02:52,403 --> 01:02:55,823
Don't say "yes" as if I were...

494
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:02,830
Giuliana, who could have screamed?
There's only the sea!

495
01:03:04,164 --> 01:03:06,792
Linda, why did you say "perhaps"?

496
01:03:08,127 --> 01:03:10,003
I did?

497
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:23,934
Damn!

498
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:36,905
No doubts,
it's smallpox, cholera or leprosy!

499
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:39,241
Don't exaggerate!

500
01:03:39,324 --> 01:03:42,119
One or two flags for epidemics?

501
01:03:42,202 --> 01:03:43,412
One.

502
01:03:45,205 --> 01:03:46,832
Let's go.

503
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:50,168
Please, Ugo, let's go!

504
01:03:50,252 --> 01:03:52,921
Come on, it's probably a precaution.

505
01:03:53,005 --> 01:03:55,841
- A case of colic!
- Let's wait for the doctor!

506
01:03:56,174 --> 01:04:00,929
We do know him. You know him, too.
We'll ask me how come...

507
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:04,308
We won't ask a thing.
Where are my gloves?

508
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,437
Let's go.
Let's go.

509
01:05:01,907 --> 01:05:03,825
Do you have my bag?

510
01:05:06,286 --> 01:05:07,954
On the steps.

511
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,456
I'll get it.

512
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:16,546
Don't go!
Forget it! I don't care!

513
01:05:17,297 --> 01:05:19,966
But, I have all my shots already.

514
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,302
I don't want you to!

515
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,929
It's no risk.

516
01:05:25,013 --> 01:05:26,806
I say no!

517
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:30,477
Giuliana, come on.
Get into the car. I'll go.

518
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:56,086
Corrado, wait. I'll go.

519
01:06:03,343 --> 01:06:04,552
Let's go.

520
01:07:47,488 --> 01:07:50,449
Forgive me, Ugo.
A mistake.

521
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:54,412
Didn't you see the ship?
First you're scared, then...

522
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,455
No, I didn't see it.

523
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,000
All I wanted was...

524
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,210
to drive home.

525
01:08:01,294 --> 01:08:03,587
It was the fog,

526
01:08:03,963 --> 01:08:05,840
and I made a mistake.

527
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,466
I swear it, Ugo.

528
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:09,844
Why should you cry?

529
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,491
That's nice!

530
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,248
I'll pack. How long will you be gone?

531
01:08:39,331 --> 01:08:40,416
Five or six days.

532
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:41,500
All right.

533
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,003
Mommy, how much is one plus one?

534
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,255
Two, of course!

535
01:08:46,338 --> 01:08:48,257
No! Look.

536
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:49,675
Let's see.

537
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:55,264
Careful.

538
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:06,859
Now count!

539
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,446
One! It's true!

540
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:12,698
Look at that!

541
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:42,227
While I'm away,
you can ask Linda to stay over.

542
01:09:44,396 --> 01:09:45,397
Why?

543
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:49,068
So you're not alone
if you wake up at night.

544
01:09:52,154 --> 01:09:53,489
Yes, yes.

545
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:56,408
I'll tell her.

546
01:10:01,747 --> 01:10:03,248
Better not.

547
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:35,864
Like it?

548
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,784
See?

549
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:41,203
You see...

550
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,461
How it turns!

551
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:56,802
- Put it upright.
- Yes.

552
01:11:03,975 --> 01:11:05,727
Do you know why it stays up?

553
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:09,064
- There's a gyroscope in it.
- What's a gyroscope?

554
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:11,650
They put them on ships.

555
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:13,860
To steady them on rough seas.

556
01:12:11,751 --> 01:12:27,350
Good-bye.

557
01:12:27,392 --> 01:12:31,229
It's half the price
for men and equipment.

558
01:12:31,563 --> 01:12:34,566
He'll go to Buenos Aires,
but that's fine.

559
01:12:41,448 --> 01:12:43,241
What do you take along?

560
01:12:45,493 --> 01:12:49,414
Generators, trucks, pipes,

561
01:12:49,497 --> 01:12:51,374
the factory equipment...

562
01:12:51,499 --> 01:12:53,918
No, your things...

563
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:56,337
your personal things.

564
01:12:56,421 --> 01:12:58,089
Nothing.

565
01:12:58,715 --> 01:13:00,592
Two or three bags.

566
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:07,098
If I were to leave,

567
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:09,642
I'd take everything.

568
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:15,189
All I see and have...

569
01:13:15,315 --> 01:13:17,442
at hand every day...

570
01:13:17,984 --> 01:13:19,777
even ashtrays.

571
01:13:20,528 --> 01:13:25,616
But then, why leave?

572
01:13:26,284 --> 01:13:27,285
You would only...

573
01:13:27,327 --> 01:13:30,538
miss everything... your street,
your city.

574
01:13:38,796 --> 01:13:40,965
When one reads ads...

575
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,134
"Cause Departure Selling"

576
01:13:43,217 --> 01:13:47,680
it seems an excuse
to abandon everything...

577
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:50,558
or almost.

578
01:13:52,643 --> 01:13:55,646
Why? That shouldn't be!

579
01:14:03,654 --> 01:14:06,449
How do you know what you'll need?

580
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:10,328
And then...
the things, the people,

581
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:12,914
will they be there when you return?

582
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:17,084
Will they be the same?

583
01:14:17,168 --> 01:14:21,088
Perhaps...
I won't come back.

584
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:29,347
Were I to leave not to return,

585
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:31,974
I'd take you, too.

586
01:14:32,516 --> 01:14:34,185
Because...

587
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:36,270
you're part of me...

588
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:39,315
of what I have around.

589
01:14:59,877 --> 01:15:03,547
Had Ugo looked at me the way you do,

590
01:15:04,048 --> 01:15:06,384
he'd have found out a lot.

591
01:15:14,767 --> 01:15:16,769
About the accident?

592
01:15:24,568 --> 01:15:26,403
And the girl in the hospital?

593
01:15:35,663 --> 01:15:36,914
It was you!

594
01:15:41,877 --> 01:15:46,006
I was ashamed to admit it.

595
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:49,927
Not even Ugo knows.

596
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,849
The doctors promised not to tell.

597
01:15:57,685 --> 01:15:59,770
I tried to kill myself.

598
01:16:03,023 --> 01:16:05,359
Remember the Medicina worker?

599
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,778
Yes.

600
01:16:11,365 --> 01:16:15,619
He was in the hospital with me...

601
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,372
and very sick.

602
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:20,791
Did he too...

603
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:23,877
try to die?

604
01:16:24,712 --> 01:16:26,171
Him? No.

605
01:16:26,213 --> 01:16:28,966
He must be well now.

606
01:16:45,149 --> 01:16:46,900
And how are you?

607
01:16:47,025 --> 01:16:48,235
Fine.

608
01:17:18,432 --> 01:17:23,353
As you see, Patagonia is near
the South Pole.

609
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:25,772
We get to Buenos Aires...

610
01:17:25,856 --> 01:17:30,277
then we fly to Commodoro Riva Davia.

611
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:33,030
From there, in our trucks
some 300 miles inland...

612
01:17:33,113 --> 01:17:35,866
from Cateta Olivia.

613
01:17:36,283 --> 01:17:37,617
And housing?

614
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:40,037
- Who guarantees our wages?
- One at a time. One at a time.

615
01:17:42,039 --> 01:17:43,206
What?

616
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:44,624
And the housing?

617
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:47,794
Prefabs with every comfort.

618
01:17:48,295 --> 01:17:50,881
How do we know
you'll pay up to the end?

619
01:17:50,964 --> 01:17:54,468
What about guarantees?
A deposit in a bank...

620
01:17:54,468 --> 01:17:55,844
or something?

621
01:17:55,886 --> 01:17:58,138
We'll discuss that, too, in a minute.

622
01:17:58,221 --> 01:18:00,515
One thing at a time, be patient.

623
01:18:00,557 --> 01:18:01,892
Is there a hospital?

624
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:05,896
Yes, well-equipped
and an Italian doctor, too.

625
01:18:05,979 --> 01:18:06,980
He's from Turin.

626
01:18:07,063 --> 01:18:09,900
When can we send for our wives?

627
01:18:13,653 --> 01:18:18,200
After a year. But you can phone
once a month.

628
01:18:18,241 --> 01:18:19,242
Who pays?

629
01:18:20,493 --> 01:18:23,914
The company.
Unless you call more often...

630
01:18:23,997 --> 01:18:26,124
- And the sports newspapers?
- They're available.

631
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:28,251
You'll get...

632
01:18:28,335 --> 01:18:29,920
all Italian newspapers...

633
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:31,755
but a little late.

634
01:18:31,796 --> 01:18:33,089
Is there TV?

635
01:18:33,173 --> 01:18:36,468
Yes, sure, the TV.
You're there to work, not to watch TV.

636
01:18:39,346 --> 01:18:41,765
But if we have TV it's better, right?

637
01:18:44,309 --> 01:18:47,437
Do women there go bare-breasted?

638
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,607
Yeah, sure, you wish.
You'd really like that, wouldn't you?

639
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:48,665
He says he can't stand.
His legs.

640
01:19:48,748 --> 01:19:50,750
What is it?

641
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:55,421
What happened?

642
01:19:56,422 --> 01:19:58,091
What hurts?

643
01:19:58,508 --> 01:19:59,676
Here?

644
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:03,763
Here then.

645
01:20:06,182 --> 01:20:07,350
Here?

646
01:20:15,191 --> 01:20:16,651
Does that hurt?

647
01:20:17,276 --> 01:20:18,694
I don't feel it.

648
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,698
You don't feel it?

649
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,702
If I do this?

650
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:33,334
I know.

651
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:36,546
You don't want to go to kindergarten.

652
01:20:43,678 --> 01:20:46,055
Look, how pretty!

653
01:20:46,138 --> 01:20:49,725
Come see the nice ship!

654
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,728
It's so big...

655
01:20:52,812 --> 01:20:55,481
all white.

656
01:20:55,815 --> 01:20:57,567
Come...

657
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:00,570
Come...

658
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,989
Love...

659
01:21:03,656 --> 01:21:07,577
If you don't say what hurts,
what can I do?

660
01:21:10,663 --> 01:21:13,749
Tell me...
what hurts?

661
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:16,502
Madam, let me try to pick him up.

662
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,421
Yes, try it.

663
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:20,506
Here.

664
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:24,010
Oh my God, you can't stand.

665
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:29,598
Love, please tell me.

666
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:34,937
How else can I help?

667
01:21:35,813 --> 01:21:37,273
Hold him up.

668
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:45,740
It's not possible.

669
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:48,409
Come here.

670
01:21:51,287 --> 01:21:52,580
Love,

671
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:56,959
how did it start?

672
01:21:58,544 --> 01:21:59,837
Tell me.

673
01:22:00,212 --> 01:22:02,715
You woke up this way?

674
01:22:02,882 --> 01:22:06,719
Or was it last night?
Tell me, love.

675
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:08,971
A thermometer.

676
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:10,890
Did he get his fourth polio shot?

677
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:14,560
Sure, the doctor said so.

678
01:22:22,902 --> 01:22:25,905
Then why 24 hours for the diagnosis?

679
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:27,823
I won't wait.

680
01:22:28,032 --> 01:22:30,492
I can't wait that long.

681
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:32,244
I'll call another doctor.

682
01:22:48,886 --> 01:22:51,764
I'm tired of this game.

683
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:09,782
Draw me a new picture.

684
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:26,715
Why don't you tell me a story?

685
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,803
I've told you all those I know.

686
01:23:31,887 --> 01:23:34,473
Why not yesterday's?

687
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:37,059
Which one?

688
01:23:37,351 --> 01:23:39,311
About the kite.

689
01:23:46,693 --> 01:23:50,238
Why not rest a little?

690
01:23:54,326 --> 01:23:56,745
I'll tell it later.

691
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:04,961
Once there was a girl on an island.

692
01:24:05,337 --> 01:24:09,341
She was bored with grownups,
who scared her.

693
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:13,428
She didn't like boys,
all pretending to be grownups.

694
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:16,014
So, she was always alone,

695
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:23,855
among the cormorants,

696
01:24:24,523 --> 01:24:26,358
the seagulls...

697
01:24:27,526 --> 01:24:29,694
and wild rabbits.

698
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:47,379
She had found a little isolated beach...

699
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:50,382
where the sea was transparent...

700
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:52,634
and the sand pink.

701
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:08,483
She loved that spot.

702
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:12,153
Nature's colors were so lovely,

703
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:15,282
and there was no sound.

704
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:52,277
She left...

705
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:55,697
when the sun went down.

706
01:26:35,486 --> 01:26:37,196
One morning...

707
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:40,325
a boat appeared.

708
01:26:58,426 --> 01:27:02,180
Not one of the usual boats,

709
01:27:03,097 --> 01:27:06,601
a real sailing ship...

710
01:27:08,978 --> 01:27:13,441
one of those that braved the seas
and the storms of this world.

711
01:27:14,025 --> 01:27:18,404
And, who knows...
of other worlds.

712
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,550
From afar, it looked splendid.

713
01:27:41,302 --> 01:27:45,556
As it approached,
it became mysterious.

714
01:27:46,307 --> 01:27:48,601
She saw no one aboard.

715
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:54,065
It stopped a while...

716
01:27:54,398 --> 01:27:56,233
then veered...

717
01:27:56,817 --> 01:27:58,569
and sailed away...

718
01:28:00,112 --> 01:28:02,823
silently,
just as it had come.

719
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:08,579
She was used to people's strange ways...

720
01:28:08,662 --> 01:28:10,331
and was not surprised.

721
01:28:10,456 --> 01:28:14,668
But, no sooner back on shore...
there!

722
01:28:52,206 --> 01:28:56,377
All right for one mystery,
but not two!

723
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:57,419
Who was singing?

724
01:28:58,128 --> 01:29:00,798
The beach was deserted.

725
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:03,300
But the voice was there...

726
01:29:03,801 --> 01:29:07,972
Now near.
Now far.

727
01:29:10,641 --> 01:29:14,144
Then it seemed to come
from the sea,

728
01:29:52,224 --> 01:29:54,226
an inlet among the rocks,

729
01:29:55,185 --> 01:29:57,354
many rocks that...

730
01:29:58,939 --> 01:30:01,567
she had never realized,

731
01:30:02,568 --> 01:30:06,029
looked like flesh.

732
01:30:08,282 --> 01:30:09,783
And the voice...

733
01:30:10,868 --> 01:30:12,369
at that point...

734
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,956
was so sweet.

735
01:30:16,456 --> 01:30:19,042
Who was singing?

736
01:30:19,459 --> 01:30:21,378
Everybody.

737
01:30:22,713 --> 01:30:24,214
Everything.

738
01:30:54,494 --> 01:30:58,498
Miss. Miss. Miss.

739
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:01,501
The magazines.

740
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:51,718
But, then...

741
01:32:04,397 --> 01:32:06,149
Why...

742
01:32:06,483 --> 01:32:08,818
did you tell me...

743
01:33:23,828 --> 01:33:24,829
What's his room number?

744
01:33:24,912 --> 01:33:26,080
Pardon? Whose?

745
01:33:26,163 --> 01:33:27,665
What do you mean "whose"?

746
01:33:27,915 --> 01:33:29,750
Don't you remember the name?

747
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:31,669
The name?

748
01:33:32,837 --> 01:33:36,090
The name...
The name, I don't...

749
01:33:44,432 --> 01:33:45,683
Corrado.

750
01:33:49,019 --> 01:33:52,440
The engineer, Mr. Zeller?
Room 309.

751
01:33:53,524 --> 01:33:55,943
First register, please!

752
01:34:23,537 --> 01:34:24,789
Your son?

753
01:34:27,475 --> 01:34:29,027
He's fine.

754
01:34:30,044 --> 01:34:32,213
He doesn't need me.

755
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,299
I need him.

756
01:34:36,183 --> 01:34:37,768
What is it?

757
01:34:40,521 --> 01:34:42,606
Everything hurts...
my hair,

758
01:34:43,273 --> 01:34:44,858
my eyes,

759
01:34:44,942 --> 01:34:48,278
my throat, my mouth...

760
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,282
Am I shaking?

761
01:34:53,534 --> 01:34:55,202
A little. Perhaps it's the cold.

762
01:34:55,285 --> 01:34:57,204
Yes, I'm cold.

763
01:34:57,871 --> 01:34:59,456
So cold.

764
01:35:00,457 --> 01:35:02,209
I'm cold.

765
01:35:28,068 --> 01:35:30,237
You don't love me, do you?

766
01:35:40,914 --> 01:35:42,582
Why do you ask?

767
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:45,669
I don't really know.

768
01:35:46,753 --> 01:35:48,839
I never get enough.

769
01:35:49,256 --> 01:35:52,509
Why do I always need other people?

770
01:35:54,761 --> 01:35:58,847
I must be stupid.

771
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:00,100
That's why I don't make it.

772
01:36:07,524 --> 01:36:09,442
I'd like...

773
01:36:10,694 --> 01:36:13,864
all the people who ever loved me...

774
01:36:14,948 --> 01:36:17,534
here, around me...

775
01:36:17,617 --> 01:36:21,121
like a wall.

776
01:36:24,207 --> 01:36:26,876
Giuliana, tell me what happened.

777
01:36:29,462 --> 01:36:30,964
Nothing.

778
01:36:32,132 --> 01:36:33,717
Just think...

779
01:36:35,218 --> 01:36:36,553
nothing!

780
01:36:54,487 --> 01:36:57,157
I'm not well.

781
01:36:58,825 --> 01:37:00,994
I'll never get well.

782
01:37:03,163 --> 01:37:04,414
Never.

783
01:37:27,187 --> 01:37:30,190
You think about it too much.

784
01:37:30,273 --> 01:37:32,859
It's a sickness like any other.

785
01:37:33,693 --> 01:37:36,029
We all suffer from it...

786
01:37:37,363 --> 01:37:38,698
more or less.

787
01:37:39,532 --> 01:37:41,701
We all need help.

788
01:38:28,414 --> 01:38:30,416
Who knows whether...

789
01:38:30,917 --> 01:38:36,088
somewhere in this world
one could be better off.

790
01:38:37,006 --> 01:38:38,591
Perhaps nowhere.

791
01:38:38,674 --> 01:38:40,676
You may be right.

792
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,430
It's go, go, go, only to end up
back where we started.

793
01:38:45,348 --> 01:38:47,350
It's happening to me.

794
01:38:48,851 --> 01:38:51,604
I'm just as I was six years ago.

795
01:38:53,272 --> 01:38:55,107
Yet, I don't know...

796
01:38:56,108 --> 01:38:59,528
if this makes me want to leave or stay.

797
01:39:35,564 --> 01:39:37,066
When are you leaving?

798
01:39:37,149 --> 01:39:38,901
I don't know.

799
01:39:59,089 --> 01:40:00,507
- What are you looking at?
- There.

800
01:41:00,892 --> 01:41:03,102
At times, I'd like to assault someone.

801
01:41:04,646 --> 01:41:06,573
What's so bad about that?

802
01:41:07,156 --> 01:41:10,076
At times, I too...

803
01:41:23,214 --> 01:41:24,924
Help me.

804
01:41:25,842 --> 01:41:28,386
Help me, please.

805
01:41:31,139 --> 01:41:34,642
I'm afraid I won't make it.

806
01:41:37,979 --> 01:41:39,439
I'm scared.

807
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,942
Calm down. What are you scared of?

808
01:41:44,569 --> 01:41:47,447
Of the streets,
of factories,

809
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:51,075
of colors,
of people, of everything.

810
01:46:58,798 --> 01:47:03,261
Giuliana, what are you planning to do?

811
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,804
Nothing.

812
01:47:04,888 --> 01:47:06,598
It's absurd.

813
01:47:06,848 --> 01:47:11,394
Don't worry about me. Everybody does...

814
01:47:11,478 --> 01:47:14,064
The doctors keep talking about me!

815
01:47:13,147 --> 01:47:14,857
But I feel sick...

816
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:17,652
when I'm left alone.

817
01:47:19,444 --> 01:47:20,696
I can't take it any more!

818
01:47:27,411 --> 01:47:31,790
I've done everything...

819
01:47:34,042 --> 01:47:36,294
to "readjust to reality"...

820
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:39,589
as they say in the hospital.

821
01:47:39,714 --> 01:47:41,549
It's seems I've succeeded, as I've...

822
01:47:42,926 --> 01:47:45,303
even managed...

823
01:47:45,804 --> 01:47:48,515
to be an unfaithful wife.

824
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:51,726
Don't think that, Giuliana.

825
01:47:52,852 --> 01:47:56,439
Sure, just don't think.

826
01:47:57,315 --> 01:47:59,192
Fine solution!

827
01:48:04,697 --> 01:48:07,867
There's something terrible
about reality...

828
01:48:07,951 --> 01:48:10,036
and I don't know what.

829
01:48:12,789 --> 01:48:14,874
Nobody tells me.

830
01:48:19,337 --> 01:48:22,257
You haven't helped me either, Corrado.

831
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:08,441
Excuse me... tell me...

832
01:52:14,948 --> 01:52:18,910
I didn't want to.

833
01:52:22,612 --> 01:52:26,783
Does this ship take passengers?

834
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:37,043
No, I really haven't decided yet.

835
01:52:59,733 --> 01:53:02,235
I can't decide.

836
01:53:02,944 --> 01:53:05,488
I'm not a single woman.

837
01:53:07,115 --> 01:53:10,410
But, at times,

838
01:53:10,744 --> 01:53:14,622
I feel...
separated.

839
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,792
Not from my husband, no.

840
01:53:18,168 --> 01:53:22,297
The bodies... are... separated.

841
01:53:25,425 --> 01:53:27,260
If you pinch me,

842
01:53:28,011 --> 01:53:29,888
you don't suffer.

843
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:37,562
What was I saying?

844
01:53:39,564 --> 01:53:40,857
Oh, yes.

845
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:43,943
I have been sick, but...

846
01:53:45,195 --> 01:53:47,447
I must not think of it.

847
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:48,740
That is...

848
01:53:49,657 --> 01:53:51,951
I have to think...

849
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:54,913
that all that happens to me...

850
01:53:55,622 --> 01:53:57,540
is my life.

851
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,460
That's it!

852
01:54:01,502 --> 01:54:03,212
I'm sorry.

853
01:54:02,847 --> 01:54:04,182
Forgive me.

854
01:55:00,236 --> 01:55:06,534
Valerio!

855
01:55:06,575 --> 01:55:09,995
Let's go, Valerio.

856
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:20,839
- Why is it doing that?
- I don't know.

857
01:55:37,314 --> 01:55:38,732
Watch out.

858
01:55:48,033 --> 01:55:50,452
Why is that smoke yellow?

859
01:55:51,412 --> 01:55:53,998
Because it's poisonous.

860
01:55:57,042 --> 01:56:01,839
Then, if a little bird
flies through there, it dies!

861
01:56:03,048 --> 01:56:07,302
By now the little birds know.
They don't fly through there any more.

862
01:56:09,471 --> 01:56:10,472
Let's go.
