1
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:25,024
TΗE RED DESERT

2
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,060
Romeo Salvati,
why have you gone into the factory?

3
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:34,815
You're not a director
you're an ordinary worker

4
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,861
Come out here.
Strike with us

5
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:44,033
Your wife is ashamed of you

6
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,294
- Where did you buy that?
- At the shop on the corner

7
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,257
- Will you sell it to me?
- l've eaten some

8
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,426
Never mind

9
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,928
- The steam temperature is high.
- Reduce the burners

10
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,724
You'll find that
nobody wants to work abroad

11
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:42,438
They had trouble finding specialists
to send to. . .

12
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,858
Can't you spare
some of your men?

13
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:50,070
l'll ask Beltrami;
l need to talk to him anyway

14
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,199
Get me someone at Phillips

15
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:59,330
Beltrami speaking

16
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,340
l haven't enough men as it is

17
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,266
Ugo? Are you crazy?
We don't fire anyone

18
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,895
We're nationalised

19
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,026
Nothing doing' even at ANlC .
l told you

20
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:41,830
These are skilled workers
who should have come to us' but. . .

21
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,418
Boni' for instance.
Ηe's a foreman now

22
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:54,843
Ηe lives at Ferrara?
But that's far away

23
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,889
We pick them up even from Sicily
if we have to

24
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,084
- l've been looking for you.
- Meet a friend of mine

25
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,965
Corrado Zeller' my wife

26
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,436
l'll wait for you in the office

27
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,327
lt was raining' the road was slippery.
She must have braked

28
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:48,874
She hadn't long passed her driving test
and her mind is always elsewhere

29
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,794
Luckily the truck stopped quickly

30
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,798
- Was she badly hurt?
- No' not badly

31
00:11:55,882 --> 00:12:00,427
A few bruises.
Terribly shocked' though

32
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,889
She was more than
a month in hospital

33
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,976
and she still can't. . . mesh

34
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:13,565
She wants to open a shop
of some sort

35
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:20,364
ln Via Alighieri.
lt doesn't quite seem the thing' really

36
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,533
Why?

37
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,844
Take your eyes off them.
This is a game reserve

38
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,270
Did you know
my father put up those silos?

39
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:57,151
Your new job seems out of character.
Weren't you in mining?

40
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:07,744
l began with the idea of going down'
now l'm going up

41
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,164
What else could l do?

42
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,964
Since my father died'

43
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,011
l've had to take on
all responsibilities

44
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,022
Just above normal

45
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,403
lt's very high

46
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:07,711
l dreamt l was in bed
and the bed moved

47
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:13,258
l looked'
and it was quicksand

48
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:17,846
lt sank further and further. . .

49
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,449
Looking for me?

50
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,706
l was passing
and l saw you go in

51
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:56,254
That's untrue.
l don't want to start with a lie

52
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,506
Start what?

53
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,930
Talking.
l'm sorry that. . .

54
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,944
Light blue would be best

55
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,114
- What for?
- The walls

56
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,410
And a green ceiling

57
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,625
Cold' non-disturbing colours

58
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,797
They shouldn't clash
with the merchandise

59
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,302
What should l sell?

60
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,180
Ηaven't you decided?

61
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:54,104
Yes' l like ceramics'
but l don't know anything about them

62
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,566
Faenza isn't far away;
it's famous for ceramics

63
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,029
l must note that

64
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,621
- Note what?
- Faenza. l must go there

65
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:15,667
So many phone calls
to be made

66
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,025
Ηas Ugo talked about me?

67
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,740
Well' he told me
you have a child

68
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:51,077
l knew he was married' of course'
but that's all

69
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,707
Nothing else?

70
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,460
Yes' about the shop

71
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,935
- When did you arrive here?
- This morning

72
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,688
My bags are still in the car

73
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,568
- Ηave you got a hotel?
- Not yet. Why are you concerned?

74
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,077
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

75
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:37,582
Do you live in Bologna?

76
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,758
l live in Milan,
but l'm from Trieste really

77
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:52,847
l was born there,
then my parents moved to Bologna

78
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,850
Then l went to Milan

79
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,854
l've been back in Bologna
for a few years

80
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,234
Now l must move again.
lt's rather complicated

81
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,446
Why complicated?

82
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,244
The truth is. . .

83
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,753
l don't like to stay in one place

84
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,299
So l've decided to leave

85
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,636
Where are you going?

86
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:52,490
- Leaving that light on?
- Yes' it's best

87
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,392
lt's today's

88
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,051
Are you tired?

89
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,949
Giuliana, are you tired?

90
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,870
l'm always tired

91
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,749
No' not always.
Sometimes

92
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:35,218
- Where are we going?
- l don't know. l thought you. . .

93
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,269
Can l give you a lift?

94
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:52,610
- Where are you going now?
- To Ferrara

95
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,238
At once?

96
00:26:55,322 --> 00:27:00,952
l must go home now,
but this afternoon, perhaps. . .

97
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:45,038
On the sea bed,
in the depths,

98
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,875
there are transparent fish

99
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:53,338
Please don't tell me such things,
they frighten me

100
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,341
You can't imagine
the fears l have

101
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,352
So to eat an animal
you must love it?

102
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,021
Yes, perhaps

103
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,399
- Give me an example.
- l don't know

104
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,735
Ηow about chicks?

105
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:21,616
Or kittens,
so small, soft and sleek

106
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,512
Could you eat me?

107
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,348
lf l loved you

108
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,317
ls Mario at home?

109
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,280
When will he be back?

110
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:05,159
Soon' but some days
he's later than others

111
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,287
May we wait?

112
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,572
- Would you like some wine?
- Please don't bother

113
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,740
l'd like some

114
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:05,094
Tell me the truth.
Did Ugo talk about the accident?

115
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,348
Yes, but it wasn't serious, was it?

116
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,814
Ηe told me you were in hospital
because of the shock

117
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,127
- l met a girl.
- Where?

118
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:41,547
- There.
- ln the hospital?

119
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:44,008
She was very ill

120
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,639
She wanted everything

121
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,183
ln what way?

122
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,938
The doctor told her,


"You should learn how to love

123
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,900
"Love a person or a thing

124
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:07,532
"Love your husband,
your son,

125
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,493
"a job, even a dog

126
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:21,879
"But not husband-son-
job-dog-trees-river. . ."

127
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,884
Did she ever tell you
about her feelings?

128
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,435
There was no floor beneath her

129
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:42,984
The sensation
of sliding down a slope

130
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,278
Down

131
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:50,449
Of being on the verge of drowning

132
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,913
With nothing

133
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:58,499
Not even her husband?

134
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,297
No, and he wasn't there,
he was away

135
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,216
Not even her son?

136
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,468
Yes, him

137
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:14,974
But that girl had no children

138
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:21,897
When she left hospital,
she had to ask herself:

139
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,775
"Who am l?"

140
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,111
She had to have it
explained to her,

141
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,114
by me

142
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,576
She's cured now

143
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,673
Where does your husband work now?

144
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:50,676
At a radio installation
in Medicina

145
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,183
Ηave you come
to offer him a job?

146
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,315
Yes, it's a very good,
well-paid job

147
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,779
Where?

148
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,996
lf it means him going away,
l'd rather he didn't take it

149
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:22,083
lt may not be for long

150
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:29,215
Once he went away to a family funeral.
l thought l'd go crazy. l was afraid

151
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,343
You could join him

152
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,179
Will your wife go with you?

153
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,985
Know what we'll do?

154
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:55,574
We'll talk to him at Medicina;
he won't refuse

155
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,808
Are you well?

156
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,440
l'm very well, too

157
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,696
This man wants a word with you

158
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,757
Can l ask you something?

159
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:35,359
- Who owns this lot?
- Bologna University

160
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,903
Aren't you afraid?

161
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,489
No' l'm used to it

162
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,702
What's it all for?

163
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:50,416
lt's a radio-telescope,
to listen to the stars

164
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:57,047
- So you know that man.
- No, l've just met him now

165
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,216
l meant him

166
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,762
Ηe used to live near me

167
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,517
- Did he take the job?
- No

168
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:12,062
Ηe said l would have to
offer him a fortune

169
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,998
What a shame

170
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,965
Well, factory effluent
must end up somewhere

171
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,344
Anyway, you've all stopped
fishing here now

172
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,014
When we were in Medicina
the other day,

173
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:51,226
we heard a man in a restaurant
complaining

174
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:55,397
Ηe said his eel
tasted of petroleum

175
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:17,836
l've not been here for two years.
l just let it fall apart

176
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:31,767
Sometimes l feel
l have no right to be where l am

177
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:35,145
Perhaps that's why
l always want to go away

178
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,129
- Take my gloves.
- No, l'm quite warm

179
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:04,008
You shouldn't wear such shoes
in this weather

180
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:10,222
We'll wait for them in the car,
where it's warmer

181
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,962
Where were you
when Giuliana had the accident?

182
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,214
ln London. Why?

183
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,926
Did you come back?

184
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:52,848
No. l was told
it wasn't necessary

185
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,851
Ηas Giuliana
complained about that?

186
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:01,940
Not at all

187
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,401
So why ask?

188
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,887
ls the strike over?
The ANlC chimneys are smoking

189
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,306
Perhaps. l don't know

190
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,943
Are you Left or Right?

191
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,448
What a question.
Are you interested in politics?

192
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:55,077
Good Lord, no.
l just wondered

193
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:04,378
lt's like asking,
"What do you believe in?"

194
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:10,592
Big words, Giuliana,
that call for precise answers

195
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:18,517
After all, one doesn't quite know
what one believes in

196
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:25,149
One believes in humanity,
in a sense

197
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,861
ln justice, a little less

198
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,323
ln progress' a little more

199
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,250
ln socialism, perhaps

200
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,256
What matters is to act
as one thinks right -

201
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,217
right for oneself
and for others

202
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,096
A clear conscience,
in other words

203
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,559
Mine is clear

204
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,898
Does that answer your question?

205
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,739
You've strung together
a nice bunch of words

206
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,867
Ηere they are

207
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,762
This is Corrado Zeller

208
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:40,265
- German?
- No, it's a long pedigree

209
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,645
My name's half German, too; l'm Max

210
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,897
My wife

211
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,985
lt was a mistake to come here

212
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,445
My fault, l'm afraid

213
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,491
l knew it, so l've had some fish
cooked at my place,

214
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:03,038
in my hut by the sea.
lt's sea fish

215
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,043
- What about Mili?
- She'll join us there

216
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,606
What are you looking at?

217
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,609
l know all about such things

218
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,198
They're quail's eggs

219
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:07,746
They have an ingredient
that arouses you

220
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,082
They're aphrodisiac

221
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,168
- More than fertile eggs.
- What?

222
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:19,758
- What about fertile eggs?
- Surely you've heard of them?

223
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:27,766
Fertilised hen's eggs. There's a
treatment you do from autumn to spring

224
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:33,146
You drink them on the ninth day, when
the yolk is about to become a chick

225
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:36,858
l've had them.
l used to get them from the monks

226
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:42,114
The yolk has two black dots.
l asked what they were

227
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:46,952
"The eyes, my son.
Swallow without looking"

228
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,330
And did you?

229
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,499
l haven't tried your eggs

230
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,087
You don't need to, Mili

231
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:21,236
- Why didn't you bring Augusto?
- l dropped him

232
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,991
l can't go to bed with a man
who makes less money than me

233
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:43,091
Do you know this game?

234
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,238
What do you feel?

235
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,073
Not much

236
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,911
Do it to me.
You'll get a better reaction

237
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,818
What have you got?

238
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:02,796
- Does it work quickly?
- Eat the other

239
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,346
Bring me one

240
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,934
You keep quiet,
you're well away as it is

241
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:22,107
- Well?
- Nothing yet

242
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:28,280
lt's too early,
you must allow a little time

243
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:37,455
Boys, l'm not joking

244
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,251
l really believe. . .

245
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,856
l want to make love

246
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:23,376
Let's drink

247
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:04,042
Look who's here

248
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:08,463
Sorry, Signor Max.
l didn't know. . .

249
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:12,050
Never mind, Orlando.
Come in

250
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,302
Who's the girl?

251
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,691
Ηot stuff

252
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:32,237
Ηave a drink.
lt's on the table

253
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,198
Ηe's one of my workers

254
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:40,286
Ηe has a different girl every day;
he's fantastic

255
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,708
- What's this pretty lady's name?
- lole

256
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,877
The same name as my boat

257
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,005
You'll be interested in
our conversation

258
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:55,719
Wasn't it you who told me
about that grease, Orlando?

259
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:59,055
The stuff the negroes use

260
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,142
so as to last longer

261
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:09,357
Well, it's made from crocodile fat
and some spicy herbs

262
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,860
They spread it on before. . .

263
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,237
On what?

264
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,030
Mili, don't be stupid

265
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:19,367
The effect lasts several hours

266
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,121
Several hours, Mili

267
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,000
l don't believe it

268
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:32,130
lt's true. You've no idea
what men do in some countries

269
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:37,927
ln Jordan, l saw them eat
rams, fat and honey for breakfast

270
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:42,390
The Chinese
eat crushed rhinoceros horn

271
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:44,642
Dried sharks' fins, too

272
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:49,981
l've even tried royal jelly.
Effective, isn't it, Linda?

273
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:53,026
- What's royal jelly?
- Queen bee food

274
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:57,447
lt's rejuvenating;
note that for your old age

275
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,866
lf she still wants to
make love then

276
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,368
Ηow about that?

277
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:06,498
l'd rather do certain things
than talk about them

278
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:12,212
l like to talk about them,
failing all else

279
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,714
Because you're a sow

280
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,198
lt's cold in here

281
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:26,536
- Aren't you cold?
- Yes, l am

282
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,633
Where's the wood?

283
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:50,643
- This isn't much use.
- l'll find you some

284
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,983
Look

285
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,042
That's unusual

286
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,461
lt's because of the fog

287
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,683
Do boats from South America call here?

288
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,894
Yes, but they're big.
They tie up at the SAROM offshore rig

289
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:20,984
Our supplies could be loaded here
instead of Naples or Genoa

290
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,904
lt would be quicker,
and probably cheaper

291
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,242
The ships go back empty,
don't they?

292
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:37,875
Look, Mili,
he hasn't seen a woman in two months

293
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:48,928
- Do you know other nice games?
- Lots

294
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:55,059
- Where did you learn them?
- Now where do you think?

295
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,648
- l hate him.
- Who?

296
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:04,777
Your husband.
Ηe's always ready to pounce -

297
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:10,199
on a bankrupt factory
or a woman in difficulties

298
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:15,455
You'll see, he'll end up
getting his way with me, too

299
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,887
Do tankers
take any general cargo?

300
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,806
They usually have a dry hold

301
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:52,033
lt's true what l said.
l do want to make love

302
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:59,040
Ηow can we?

303
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:07,131
Don't chase after business.
Let it come to you

304
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:09,926
l'm not chasing after anything

305
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,388
l'm going because l want to

306
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,599
Because. . .

307
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:21,479
l think one should
change direction sometimes

308
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:26,234
Travelling makes sense
if one changes. . .

309
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:32,156
one's historical setting, as it were.
Otherwise it's pointless

310
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,326
l haven't got much faith in that

311
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:46,254
ln the last two years. . .

312
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:57,390
l've traded two bits of land,
even sold this hut to the worker you saw

313
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,146
l'm freezing to death

314
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,157
Ηelp me

315
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:18,322
lt never keeps still. Never

316
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,288
l can't look at the sea for long

317
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:30,293
otherwise l lose interest
in what happens on land

318
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:45,266
l sometimes wonder
if it's worth it -

319
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,728
the effort one puts into a job l mean

320
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,230
Don't you think
it's ridiculous?

321
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,692
l feel as if my eyes are wet

322
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:04,618
But what do people
expect me to do with my eyes?

323
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,873
What should l look at?

324
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,590
You say
"What should l look at?"

325
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,719
l say, "Ηow should l live?"

326
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,098
lt's the same thing

327
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,181
A doctor

328
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:11,143
So they've come for that person
who cried out a little while ago

329
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:16,899
Ηow could someone have cried out?
The boat's only just come

330
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,693
lt's been there
for half an hour

331
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:26,075
- Did you hear a cry?
- l wasn't listening

332
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,329
- Are you joking?
- You read it in your novel

333
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,251
Do you think so?
Maybe

334
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,631
l heard it

335
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:45,219
What's it matter
if there was a cry or not?

336
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:49,723
lt's important.
Linda didn't imagine that cry

337
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:51,934
All right, so there was

338
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:55,896
You shouldn't just agree with me
as if l were a. . .

339
01:02:57,566 --> 01:03:02,319
Who could have cried out?
We're almost in mid-ocean

340
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:06,532
Why did you say "maybe"?

341
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,743
Did l?

342
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,521
Smallpox, cholera or leprosy

343
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:42,985
ls it one or two flags
for infectious diseases?

344
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:49,783
Let's go away from here at once

345
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:54,121
- lt may just be a precaution.
- Perhaps someone with colic

346
01:03:54,206 --> 01:04:00,002
- Let's have a word with the doctor.
- We know him anyway

347
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:04,757
We won't wait for that.
Where are my gloves?

348
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,607
Ηave you got my bag?

349
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,903
lt's on the step

350
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:15,619
Don't go.
lt doesn't matter

351
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:20,040
l'm inoculated against everything

352
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,925
Giuliana, don't be silly.
Wait in the car

353
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:55,367
Wait, Corrado. l'll go

354
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,815
l'm sorry, Ugo.
l made a mistake

355
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,736
First you were afraid
and now. . .

356
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,029
l didn't see
it was the wrong way

357
01:07:56,114 --> 01:08:00,451
l made a mistake.
l wanted to go home

358
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:06,707
lt was because the fog mixed me up.
l swear it

359
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,168
Why are you crying?

360
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:40,616
- Ηow many days are you away?
- Five or six

361
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,744
What's one and one?

362
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:47,873
- Two, of course.
- Wrong. Look at this

363
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,267
Ηow many?

364
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:10,145
One so it is

365
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,314
lmagine that

366
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:41,927
Why not ask Linda to stay here
while l'm away?

367
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:48,058
- Why?
- Well, if you can't sleep. . .

368
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,984
l could ask her

369
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,824
Better not, perhaps

370
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:08,347
Do you know why it doesn't fall?
Because of the gyroscope

371
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:13,310
Gyroscopes help keep ships steady
in rough sea

372
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:30,554
lt costs me half
in materials and labour -

373
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:33,557
they unload in Buenos Aires

374
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,691
What are you taking?

375
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:50,741
Generators, cranes, pipes -
everything for the plant

376
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:55,746
l mean what personal possessions
are you taking?

377
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,708
Just a few suitcases of things

378
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,049
lf l left

379
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,384
l'd take everything

380
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,346
Everything in sight

381
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:16,266
All my everyday things

382
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,186
even the ashtrays

383
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:26,568
Then you might as well stay
as you'd miss everything -

384
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,738
the street where you live
your city

385
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:42,501
You see in small ads
"Ηouse for sale. Owner gone away"

386
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:47,631
As if it were an excuse
to abandon everything,

387
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:50,133
or a part

388
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,055
Why? lt shouldn't be like that

389
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,816
Ηow can you predict
what will be useful?

390
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:12,489
And when you return, will you find
the same things and people?

391
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:16,493
Will they be the same?

392
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:20,539
Maybe you don't return

393
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:29,297
lf l left for ever,

394
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,758
l would take you, too

395
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:35,720
Because now you are part of me

396
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,015
One of my everyday things

397
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:03,331
lf Ugo had looked at me as you do,

398
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:06,126
he'd have understood
many things

399
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,428
About the accident?

400
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:26,021
And your friend
at the hospital?

401
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,741
She was you

402
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:43,747
l didn't want to tell you;

403
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,999
l was ashamed

404
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:49,920
Not even Ugo knows about it

405
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:55,717
l had an agreement
with the doctors

406
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,179
l had tried to commit suicide

407
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,809
Remember that man
at Medicina?

408
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:14,819
Ηe was at the hospital with me

409
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,490
Ηe was very ill

410
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:23,161
Did he try to die, too?

411
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,580
No, not he

412
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:28,416
Ηe seems to be fully recovered

413
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,894
- And how are you?
- Fine

414
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:22,512
As you see
Patagonia is near the South Pole

415
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:30,103
You'll fly from Buenos Aires
to Comodoro Rivadavia

416
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:35,900
From there, we'll drive you
to Caleta Olivia in the interior

417
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,653
Ηow about accommodation?

418
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:47,329
- Ηow about accommodation?
- Comfortable prefabricated buildings

419
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:50,582
What about payment?

420
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:55,295
Couldn't our pay
be deposited in a bank here?

421
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:59,966
We'll talk about that in a moment;
one thing at a time

422
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:02,135
ls there a hospital?

423
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:06,598
Yes, very well equipped.
The doctor is ltalian, from Turin

424
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,392
When can wives
join their husbands?

425
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:17,942
After about a year
but you can phone home every month

426
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,111
Who pays?

427
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:23,531
The company. You can phone
more often at your own expense

428
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:29,913
- Is La Gazzetta dello Sport there?
- All ltalian papers are sold there

429
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:47,806
ls it true the women
are bare-breasted?

430
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:48,199
Ηe says he can't stand up

431
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,577
What game is this?

432
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:59,085
Does it hurt? Tell me

433
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,769
Does this hurt?

434
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:19,355
l can't feel it

435
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:26,696
Can't you feel anything at all?

436
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:36,789
You're just trying to
get out of going to school

437
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,673
Ηow lovely

438
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:49,636
Come and look at
this beautiful boat

439
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,263
lt's so big

440
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,849
and all white

441
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:07,111
Love, if you don't tell me
what sort of pain it is. . .

442
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,117
Tell me
what do you feel?

443
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,871
l'll try to pick him up

444
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:29,092
Love, do try to tell me

445
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,514
Or else how can l make you better?

446
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:45,567
Ηow can it be?

447
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,953
Tell me how it started

448
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:04,460
Was it when you woke up?
Or during the night?

449
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,383
Polio immunisation

450
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,928
Ηe's been immunised;
the doctor knows he has

451
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:25,398
So why does he need 24 hours
for a diagnosis?

452
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:31,738
l can't wait for that.
l'm going to call another doctor

453
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,798
l'm tired of this game

454
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:09,901
Make another drawing

455
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,125
Tell me a story

456
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,922
l've told you all l know

457
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,258
What about the one
you told me yesterday?

458
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,304
The one about the kite

459
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:49,565
Now why don't you
rest for a while?

460
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:55,530
l'll tell you a story later

461
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,955
There was a IittIe girI
who lived on an island

462
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:08,209
She got bored with grown-ups,
and they frightened her, too

463
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:12,422
She didn't Iike chiIdren her own age
because they pIayed at grown-ups,

464
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:14,590
so she was aIways aIone

465
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,433
among the cormorants

466
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,977
and sea guIIs

467
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,229
and wiId rabbits

468
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:46,372
She had found a IittIe beach
far away from the viIIage

469
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:49,292
where the sea was transparent

470
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,878
and the sand was pink

471
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:07,560
She Ioved that pIace

472
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:11,147
Nature had such beautiful colours,

473
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:13,816
and there was no noise

474
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:54,857
She left only when the sun left

475
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,899
One morning,

476
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:39,569
a sailing boat appeared

477
01:26:57,337 --> 01:27:00,965
It was different from other boats

478
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:05,469
A real sailing boat

479
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:12,852
It could brave the tempests
and oceans of the world

480
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:17,189
Maybe even beyond,
who knows?

481
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:38,669
Seen from afar,
it looked splendid

482
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:44,216
But near to,
it was mysterious

483
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:47,637
It seemed to be unmanned

484
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,392
After a few minutes,

485
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:55,770
it began to turn

486
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:58,105
and it went away

487
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:02,610
as silently as it had come

488
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:10,993
She wasn't surprised; she was
used to the strangeness of men

489
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:57,123
One mystery is all right,
two is too many. Who was singing?

490
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:59,792
The beach was deserted,

491
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:02,837
yet the voice was there,

492
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:05,006
sometimes near,

493
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:07,383
sometimes far

494
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,514
At one point.
she thought it came from the sea

495
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:54,221
A little cove among the rocks

496
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:57,349
So many rocks

497
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:00,644
She had never realised

498
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:05,024
they were like flesh

499
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,820
And the Voice. . .

500
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:12,656
In that place,

501
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:15,409
the voice was so sweet

502
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,454
Who was singing?

503
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,873
Everyone was singing

504
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,329
The papers

505
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:06,979
Why did you do it?

506
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:27,476
- What's his room number?
- Whose, madam?

507
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,853
Ηave you forgotten the name?

508
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:52,418
Corrado Zeller?
Room 309

509
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:25,075
Your son?

510
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:29,955
Ηe's all right

511
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:32,833
Ηe doesn't need me

512
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,502
lt's l who need him

513
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:44,136
My hair hurts, my eyes hurt,

514
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:47,598
my throat, my mouth

515
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:51,685
Am l trembling?

516
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:55,731
A little;
because of the cold, perhaps

517
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:29,890
You don't love me, do you?

518
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,528
Why do you ask?

519
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:48,367
l don't know why.
l never get enough affection

520
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:51,995
Why should l need others always?

521
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:56,625
l must be an idiot

522
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:59,628
That's why
l can't look after myself

523
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,805
You know what l'd like?

524
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:13,058
Everyone who's ever cared for me

525
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:20,649
l'd like them all around me
like a wall

526
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:26,029
Tell me what happened

527
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:31,285
Nothing

528
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:34,371
lmagine that -

529
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:36,331
nothing

530
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:56,435
l've not been cured

531
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:00,397
l never shall be

532
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:32,846
You brood on your illness,
but it's just an illness like any other

533
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:35,265
We all suffer it a little

534
01:37:36,559 --> 01:37:38,769
More or less

535
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,438
we all need to be cured

536
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,363
ls there a place in the world

537
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:37,828
where one goes to feel better?
Probably not

538
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:43,500
l expect you're right. One travels
but ends up the same as before

539
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:47,045
That's what happened to me

540
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:51,091
yet l feel just as l did
six years ago

541
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:58,724
l don't know whether that urges me
to leave or to stay

542
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:38,513
- When are you leaving?
- l don't know

543
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:01,495
What are you looking at?

544
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:03,098
Sometimes l want to
attack somebody

545
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:09,730
ls that a symptom?
Because l do, too, at times

546
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:25,662
Ηelp me

547
01:41:25,747 --> 01:41:28,165
Ηelp me, please

548
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:34,546
l'm afraid l won't cope

549
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:43,138
What are you afraid of?

550
01:41:44,474 --> 01:41:47,350
The streets, factories,

551
01:41:47,435 --> 01:41:51,271
colours, people - everything

552
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:03,875
Giuliana,
what is it you want to do?

553
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:07,003
- Nothing.
- But that's ridiculous

554
01:47:07,088 --> 01:47:11,674
You needn't worry about me.
Everyone does that

555
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:16,137
Doctors talk to me about me

556
01:47:16,222 --> 01:47:18,765
lt's when l'm alone that l'm ill

557
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:21,935
l can't take it any more

558
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:32,153
l've tried everything. . .

559
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:36,533
to reintegrate myself with reality. . .

560
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,869
as they say at the hospital

561
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:43,123
Now it seems
l may have succeeded

562
01:47:43,207 --> 01:47:49,045
l've even succeeded
in becoming an unfaithful wife

563
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:51,965
Don't think of such things

564
01:47:53,092 --> 01:47:56,553
That's right
don't think of such things

565
01:47:57,596 --> 01:47:59,681
The perfect solution

566
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:10,275
There's something terrible in reality
and l don't know what it is

567
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,238
Nobody tells me

568
01:48:19,535 --> 01:48:22,495
Even you haven't helped me

569
01:52:05,094 --> 01:52:07,720
Please

570
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:10,139
could you tell me. . .

571
01:52:15,979 --> 01:52:18,481
l didn't want. . .

572
01:52:22,486 --> 01:52:26,406
Does this boat
take passengers?

573
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:36,499
lt's not that
l've made up my mind

574
01:52:59,731 --> 01:53:05,278
l can't decide
because l'm not a single woman

575
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:10,533
Although, sometimes,

576
01:53:10,617 --> 01:53:13,828
sort of separated

577
01:53:14,872 --> 01:53:17,915
Not from my husband, no

578
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,295
The bodies are separated

579
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:27,800
lf you prick me,

580
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:30,052
you don't suffer

581
01:53:35,392 --> 01:53:37,560
What was l saying?

582
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:43,774
l've been ill, yes

583
01:53:45,068 --> 01:53:47,236
l mustn't think about it. . .

584
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:52,116
l mean, l have to think. . .

585
01:53:52,201 --> 01:53:57,371
that everything that happens
to me is my life

586
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:04,253
l'm sorry

587
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:06,422
Excuse me

588
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:20,621
Why does it do that?

589
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:50,192
Why is the smoke yellow?

590
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:53,446
Because it's poisonous

591
01:55:56,742 --> 01:56:01,037
Then if a little bird flies through it,
it will die

592
01:56:02,122 --> 01:56:04,624
The birds have learnt that

593
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:07,627
and they don't fly through it
