1
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,852
Puppet, sir? Only 10 <i>piastres.</i>

2
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,397
They're crap, squirrel. They fall apart
before you're out of the door.

3
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,024
Five then, sir. It's handmade!

4
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:39,697
Please? My sister.
She's very, very sick.

5
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,866
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

6
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,451
Do you know my mother?

7
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:47,454
- Nope.
- She's very, very sick.

8
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,625
I'll give you two.

9
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,297
That's a bad idea, you know.

10
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,842
Like feeding pigeons.

11
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,307
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.

12
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:10,561
I work for a private collector of rare
antiquities. I cabled you last week.

13
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,229
Yes.

14
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,398
And I didn't answer.

15
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,359
There's been a discovery in East Africa.

16
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,571
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

17
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,741
No, that's not possible.

18
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,286
The Byzantine Empire had adopted
Christianity at that time...

19
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:31,206
- ...but they never got that far south.
- Nevertheless, there it sits.

20
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,168
The British have financed a dig
to uncover this church.

21
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,420
We believe a rare object waits inside.

22
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,673
We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

23
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,176
So you think I'm a thief?

24
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,807
Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

25
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,601
No...

26
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:54,104
...simply a man who's lost faith
in everything except himself.

27
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,107
You know nothing about me.

28
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,612
An Oxford-educated archeologist,
an expert in religious icons.

29
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,532
You were a priest before the war.
So, what happened?

30
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,294
This is a leather impression
of the artifact we're looking for.

31
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,631
A representation of a mythical demon.

32
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,483
It's Sumerian.

33
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,486
What makes you think
it's in a church in Africa?

34
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,322
Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

35
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,242
He's been persuaded to let you join it.

36
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,120
You're assuming that I will say yes.

37
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,080
You already have.

38
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,498
March!

39
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,501
Left. Left, right, left.

40
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:02,840
Left, left. Left, right, left. Left...

41
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,154
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.

42
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,619
Beautiful, aren't they?

43
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,374
It's a hobby from school days.
Works wonders for the nerves.

44
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,126
You should try it sometime.

45
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,755
What can you tell me about the dig?

46
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:51,472
The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district called Derati.

47
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,474
It was discovered
several months ago...

48
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,893
...by a detachment of my men
on maneuvers there.

49
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,647
When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

50
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,943
So, what have they learned so far?

51
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,363
That it's a church
where no church should be.

52
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,700
This is Father Francis.

53
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,037
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

54
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,956
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

55
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:21,418
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.

56
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,881
I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

57
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,008
I'm no longer a part of that.

58
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,512
But I'm sure you didn't come here
to discuss Catholic rituals.

59
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,431
I was actually headed to Kenya
on missionary work...

60
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,266
...when Rome learned of the find.

61
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,854
They that the site's religious aspect
have proper consideration.

62
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,606
Hm.

63
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,984
How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

64
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,111
We haven't...

65
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,821
...officially.

66
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,949
You're both my guests.

67
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,745
Tell me, have you any theories on
who might have built this church?

68
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,498
Well, not until I've seen it.

69
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:03,001
Surely the Vatican has some record
of its creation?

70
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,878
No, I'm afraid not.

71
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,881
We're as in the dark about it
as you are.

72
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,024
How long have you been
with the dig, Chuma?

73
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,486
Since the beginning.
The British hired me as an interpreter.

74
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,868
What happened here?

75
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,831
Plague. Ravaged the valley 50 years ago.

76
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,666
How many died?

77
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,668
All of them.

78
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,354
I'm Lankester Merrin.

79
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,066
Agent Granville should've contacted you
about my joining the dig.

80
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,734
He did.

81
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,074
Is something bothering you, mate?

82
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,580
No. I'd like to see the dig site
as soon as possible.

83
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,875
- Do you drink, Merrin?
- I shouldn't.

84
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,420
But my will is weak.

85
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,383
Then you might just survive this place.

86
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:21,098
I understand you've uncovered the church
dome but that progress has slowed down.

87
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,100
You could say that. Right, doctor?

88
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,440
- I'm Sarah Novak. Nice to meet you.
- Lankester... Lankester Merrin.

89
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,903
You still haven't made it
by my room, doctor.

90
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,073
I've been having this swelling...

91
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,786
...in the evening. Thought you might
have something I could put on it.

92
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,955
How about a muzzle?

93
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,296
So how are the interior
excavations coming on?

94
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,507
- They're not.
- No?

95
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,175
Has the structure collapsed?

96
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,304
No, the church is perfect,
but none of the men will enter.

97
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,433
- Those we have left, anyway.
- Why is that?

98
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,855
I shall be leaving for the dig
in five minutes.

99
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,240
Pleasant fellow.

100
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,745
- What's wrong with his face?
- Other than it's attached to his body?

101
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:30,500
Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind of localized infection.

102
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,503
Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

103
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,298
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.

104
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,175
If you believe the Turkana.

105
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,760
And do you?

106
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,180
No. I'm a doctor.

107
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,600
But as a priest, surely you must believe
in such things.

108
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,687
- I'm an archeologist. I'm not a priest.
- Now, that's funny.

109
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,857
I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

110
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,277
Did he? Well, he is mistaken.

111
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,447
Father Merrin.

112
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,203
This is Emekwi.

113
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,040
He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

114
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,876
Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

115
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,713
These are my sons, James and Joseph.

116
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,716
- Hello, James. Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.

117
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,968
We are Christians, you know.

118
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,136
Mm.

119
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,430
Emekwi, can you see
to Mr. Merrin's bags?

120
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,557
Oh, of course. James, Joseph?

121
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,770
Very nice meeting you, doctor.

122
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,529
There's your goddamn church.

123
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,165
Is this your first assignment, Father?

124
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,627
Well, before this, I was studying
in the archives in the Holy See.

125
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:43,383
The Vatican. Impressive. But not really
training for missionary work, is it?

126
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,823
This is strange.

127
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,035
It's 1500 years old.

128
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,996
It should be badly weathered.

129
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:16,458
It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

130
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,419
Chuma.

131
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,715
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.

132
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,680
Hyenas.

133
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,433
They've been here ever since
we started digging.

134
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,851
Even at daytime?

135
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,197
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

136
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,615
The heat?

137
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,002
<i>Joseph'?</i>

138
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,350
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

139
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,895
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.

140
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,190
I think you're about ready
for this now.

141
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,070
It's a tool for professional diggers.

142
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,239
Wow.

143
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,664
His seizure's stopped. I wanted to keep
him at the hospital for observation...

144
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,500
...but Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

145
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,170
Well, that must make your job
very hard.

146
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,339
You have no idea.

147
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,844
Thank you.

148
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,430
So, what is it you hope to find here?

149
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,474
The answer to why a church
was built here...

150
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,227
...a thousand years
before Christianity arrived.

151
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,564
You were a priest once, weren't you?

152
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,649
Yes, I was.

153
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,277
Bloody savages!

154
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,489
Can't wipe their own ass
without instruction.

155
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:18,371
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait. I found this.

156
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,915
And I want you to have it.

157
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,377
It's a St. Joseph, for luck.

158
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,214
Please. For my behavior.

159
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,221
Thank you.

160
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,098
What the hell are you doing?

161
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,393
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!

162
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,146
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.

163
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,651
All right, Merrin. I didn't know
you was a fuzzy lover.

164
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,612
It's okay. Come.

165
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,114
These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

166
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,076
How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

167
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,454
- A few days.
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?

168
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,666
We don't. Chuma will take you in
through the roof.

169
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,490
Following us, Father?

170
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,910
Is it safe to walk around?

171
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,247
Let's see.

172
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,478
Lucifer. The Lord's favorite angel.

173
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,148
Cast out after the war in heaven.

174
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,775
Can't even trust angels, can you?

175
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:08,082
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.

176
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,961
It's odd.

177
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:21,596
Churches were built to exalt heaven,
but this...

178
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,057
The weapons are pointing downward.

179
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,771
Look behind you, Father.

180
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,289
Desecration of Christ.

181
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,465
Who would do something like this?

182
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,886
The crucifix was broken off from here.

183
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,349
Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

184
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,476
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, who would know?

185
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,937
Because this place
has been vandalized.

186
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,190
Probably the lead archeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

187
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,401
So where can I find him?

188
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,027
I need to talk to him.

189
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,863
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

190
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,199
He's gone mad.

191
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,834
No one's been inside Bession's tent
since he fell ill?

192
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,211
They are superstitious.

193
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:43,303
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.

194
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,030
Chuma!

195
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,075
Yes?

196
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,620
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanatorium in Nairobi.

197
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,292
How long has he been gone?

198
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,044
A few weeks.

199
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:01,422
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?

200
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,508
The language spoken in Palestine...

201
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,761
- ...at the time of Christ.
- And what does it say?

202
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:12,141
"The fallen shall rise
in a river of blood."

203
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,681
- Do you have a moment?
- Of course.

204
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,516
Can I get you some tea?

205
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,018
Or maybe something more substantial?

206
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,770
Yes, that would be very nice.

207
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,650
You dabble in the occult?

208
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,530
I found them here when I arrived.

209
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:16,289
I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

210
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,127
You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

211
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:27,717
There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

212
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,220
He had no medical symptoms.

213
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,724
Nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

214
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,479
His breakdown was purely mental.
And extremely severe.

215
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,398
That's why the Turkana
fear the church is cursed.

216
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,901
That and the disappearances.

217
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,737
In the past few weeks,
we've lost a dozen men.

218
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,614
Runaways?

219
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,659
- Or is it those evil spirits?
- Yeah.

220
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:09,091
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.

221
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,386
My father was a strong man.

222
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:16,557
When the Nazis started rounding up
the Jews in our town, he didn't hesitate.

223
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,394
He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

224
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:24,774
But someone turned us in, and we were
all sent to the concentration camps.

225
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,360
I'm sorry.

226
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:30,196
People can't really understand, can they?

227
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,115
If they weren't there.

228
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,285
If they didn't see.

229
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,287
No.

230
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,543
And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

231
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:49,048
I met him after the war, and we
came to Africa together, in love.

232
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:54,053
One night I realized I...
I had to tell him the truth...

233
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:58,307
...about the Nazis
and what they did to me.

234
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,727
After that he never touched me again.

235
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,188
So...

236
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,943
What turns a man of the cloth
into an archeologist?

237
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,989
I don't know, I suppose I...

238
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,743
I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

239
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,413
Do you miss it? Being a priest?

240
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:24,166
No. There's no point in that.

241
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:29,338
Sometimes I think the best view of God
is from hell.

242
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,016
I should get to bed.

243
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,856
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow,
to see Bession.

244
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,444
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?

245
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,030
He runs the sanitarium.

246
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,242
Well, thank you for the medical care.

247
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,126
And deliver us from evil...

248
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:11,464
...for thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory, forever and ever...

249
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:12,757
Amen.

250
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,938
You, priest, what is your name?

251
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,399
I'm Father Merrin.

252
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,125
God is not here today, priest.

253
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,528
Want some water?

254
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,705
Hey. What's wrong?

255
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,551
It's late. You should go back to bed.

256
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,396
Give it to me! It's mine!

257
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:17,191
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!

258
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,818
Mr. Merrin gave it to me.

259
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:22,071
- Here, take it. Take it!
- Just give it to me, you idiot!

260
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:25,241
Who are you calling idiot?
Take it, it's right here!

261
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,577
- Give it to me! It's mine!
- Shorty, shorty!

262
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,830
- Just give it to me!
- All right, okay!

263
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,042
Go back to bed, and I'll give you
the stupid thing.

264
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,056
Joseph, look out!

265
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,476
Joseph, get Papa, get Papa!

266
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,354
Joseph, help me!

267
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,777
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly!

268
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,380
Help me! Help me!

269
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,490
Help me! Papa, help me, please!

270
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:17,186
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They tore James apart.

271
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:21,357
Did you see that, Lankester?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.

272
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,402
- They were focused on his brother.
- That was a lot more than focused.

273
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,072
They acted as if he wasn't even there.

274
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,636
Can you see? Can you hear?

275
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,614
Monsieur Bession?

276
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,578
Mr. Bession.

277
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,872
You worked on a dig in Derati.

278
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,713
You drew a picture of an idol.

279
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,466
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?

280
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,594
Monsieur Bession.

281
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:17,473
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?

282
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,310
I said, how do you know my name?

283
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,154
Are you hurt?

284
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,239
No.

285
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,416
I'm free.

286
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,465
God is not here today, priest.

287
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,718
I hope he finds peace.

288
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,472
I'm Father Gionetti.

289
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,224
I've been waiting for you.

290
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,434
How did he know my name?

291
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:49,481
Have you drifted so far from God,
Merrin, that you can't see?

292
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:52,401
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

293
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,362
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

294
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,490
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

295
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,910
So, touched.
What does that mean?

296
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:06,582
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudun, France...

297
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,001
...was plagued by possession.

298
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:14,089
Thirty-four nuns had been touched by
the devil, committing unspeakable acts.

299
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:19,761
Having orgies including goats doesn't
make them possessed, simply horny...

300
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,930
...and inventive.

301
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:26,560
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

302
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:31,106
Three of them were possessed
themselves and subsequently died.

303
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:34,651
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

304
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,612
...with evil.

305
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,365
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

306
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:44,036
And that evil remains in Derati.

307
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,122
You must be careful there.

308
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:51,418
Remember, he is the father of lies.

309
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,420
He will seek to poison your mind.

310
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,216
You will need this against him.

311
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,638
<i>The Roman Rituals.</i>

312
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:07,684
If you need somebody to perform
an exorcism, I'm not your man.

313
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,728
I'm not a priest anymore.

314
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:12,981
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.

315
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,692
Only your faith can save you.

316
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,945
Well, then, I'm doomed.

317
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,213
Joseph?

318
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,154
What do you have there?

319
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,242
Can I see?

320
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,434
You threw it away.

321
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:16,355
- What the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.

322
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,440
You threw it away.

323
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,317
No, I didn't.

324
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,445
- The clasp must have come loose.
- Liar!

325
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,284
Do I repulse you that much?

326
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,412
Maybe if you could cure
my fucking face...

327
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,956
...I might look as good to you
as that archeologist.

328
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,965
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.

329
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,967
What?

330
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,805
He's coming for you.

331
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,821
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.

332
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,866
Don't worry.

333
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,660
You'll be fine.

334
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,848
Where is everybody?

335
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,518
Sebituana's baby is coming,
so the village has gathered in welcome.

336
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,049
Joseph.

337
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,218
Hey.

338
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,229
Joseph.

339
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,200
You're back.

340
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,912
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.

341
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,997
These lesions...

342
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,751
- ...they're not from the shock, are they?
- No.

343
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:46,379
They're completely asymptomatic.
It just doesn't make sense.

344
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,591
- He should have recovered by now.
- So, what is it?

345
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,177
In this part of the world...

346
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,429
...it could be a dozen things.

347
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,599
But his symptoms don't really
match any of them.

348
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,185
So all I can do is just watch and wait.

349
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,816
I have to do some work up at the dig.

350
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:10,111
- Will you be all right?
- Mm. Yes.

351
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,951
Come sit with me, Lankester.

352
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,539
I promise I won't bite.

353
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,632
What is it?

354
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:34,469
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.

355
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,764
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.

356
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,728
- How?
- I don't know.

357
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,147
Some accident.

358
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,498
I just don't understand.

359
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,127
Everything that's happening here...

360
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:10,505
It seems like I can't help
anyone anymore.

361
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,758
Hey.

362
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,680
Easy.

363
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,185
Help me hold him.

364
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:29,438
Emekwi.

365
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:32,483
I'm doing everything I can for him.

366
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,303
Joseph?

367
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:41,435
It's this place, Lankester.
The Turkana are right, it's cursed.

368
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:44,772
- Sarah.
- You don't understand.

369
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:50,444
What they did to me in the camp.
They...

370
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:54,365
There's nothing left to bleed.

371
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:58,953
There is something here,
something evil.

372
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,790
Sarah, it's so much easier
to believe in evil as an entity...

373
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:04,291
...but it's not.

374
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:07,378
It's a purely human condition
inside all of us.

375
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,633
Did Bession talk about what he found
under the church?

376
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,221
There's an ancient temple below,
a pagan place...

377
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:21,141
...where they used to conduct sacrifices,
human sacrifices.

378
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:24,562
Why would they build a church
on top of something like that?

379
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,730
Perhaps to purify the site.

380
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,483
But then, why bury it?

381
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:16,405
Merrin!

382
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,533
You better come with me.

383
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:22,411
Jefferies didn't show up
for the dig this morning.

384
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:26,081
He wasn't in his room, so they came
to the bar, and they found...

385
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:16,090
Chief Sebituana's baby
was stillborn last night.

386
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:17,758
He blames the whites.

387
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:19,593
You think the Turkana took Jeffries?

388
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,721
I think this place is on the verge
of an uprising.

389
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,765
I've contacted Major Granville.

390
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:27,559
A detachment will be here
by this afternoon.

391
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,312
You disagree?

392
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:36,276
In my experience, bringing soldiers
into a situation is always a bad idea.

393
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,974
Who buried them?

394
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,231
Everybody died.

395
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:17,693
Who buried them?

396
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,674
All right.

397
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:42,593
Gut!

398
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,094
- Major Granville.
- Hello.

399
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:47,014
Come on. Out you get.
Move it, Wilkins.

400
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,227
- Any answers on Jefferies?
- I'm afraid not.

401
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:55,814
Well, you did the right thing
calling me, Father.

402
01:02:55,981 --> 01:03:00,402
I've been in these situations before,
and you have to stay on top of...

403
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,327
On top of these people.

404
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:12,539
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible
for what's happening here, major.

405
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:17,878
Major Granville?

406
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:24,218
This dig is too important to jeopardize,
and until I'm satisfied...

407
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:28,722
...the excavation is secure, the British
army will assume complete control.

408
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:33,977
- The Turkana won't like force.
- I'm not concerned with what they like.

409
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:36,647
And if they start any more trouble...

410
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:40,734
...they will have to answer to the might
of His Majesty King George.

411
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,243
You cannot be here.

412
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:52,371
Please tell Sebituana
I'm sorry for his loss.

413
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:54,498
You are not welcome here.

414
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:59,503
I want to know about the plague
that destroyed this village 50 years ago.

415
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,547
It was not a plague.

416
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,552
So, what was it?

417
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:11,265
The evil in your church,
it has taken Emekwi's youngest son...

418
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,475
...and it is getting stronger.

419
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:18,397
You must abandon your work,
or we'll be forced to stop you.

420
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,150
So you don't want to tell me?

421
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:32,995
He says he doesn't have to tell you,
because it's happening again...

422
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:35,497
...right now.

423
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,903
You don't bury your dead.
You cremate them.

424
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:09,489
- Yes.
- Then who's buried in that graveyard?

425
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:54,993
I'm sorry.

426
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,980
What are you...?

427
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:05,105
I'm sorry.

428
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:06,940
Daddy.

429
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:45,330
I will shoot 10, priest...

430
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:47,457
...and you will choose.

431
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:48,959
I can't do that.

432
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:59,386
No!

433
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,390
Now you choose...

434
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,934
...or I will kill them all.

435
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,231
Are you praying...

436
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:12,816
...to God?

437
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:15,652
Shoot me.

438
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:25,662
God is not here today, priest.

439
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:05,785
Papa.

440
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,950
- They're empty.
- What?

441
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,911
I dug up three graves.
They were all empty. What happened?

442
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,579
- I don't know.
- Oh, yes, you do.

443
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:53,124
- You've been lying since we got here.
- Let go of me.

444
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,752
Damn it!
There are crosses on the graves.

445
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,837
There are crosses on the coffins.

446
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,006
The church buried them, didn't they?

447
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:01,758
Didn't they?

448
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:03,802
Yes.

449
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,263
Why?

450
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,765
What were they hiding?

451
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:11,351
That this place is damned.

452
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:15,146
No! You asked the question!
Now you're gonna listen to the answer!

453
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:18,692
There was a massacre here...

454
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:21,236
...1500 years ago.

455
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:25,657
An army from the West,
led by two priests...

456
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:28,368
...searching for the origin
of a powerful evil.

457
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:31,913
When they got here,
that evil consumed them...

458
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,250
...turning the soldiers against each other
in a bloodbath.

459
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:40,839
Only a single priest survived. When that
priest made it to the Emperor Justinian...

460
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:45,719
...he ordered that a church be built over the
site and buried to seal the evil inside.

461
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,556
All mention of it was to be stricken
from the history texts forever.

462
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:51,516
But it wasn't.

463
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:53,727
No.

464
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,771
In 1893...

465
01:11:56,938 --> 01:12:00,692
...a Vatican researcher found
an ancient letter in the archives.

466
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,320
Four priests came
to examine the site...

467
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,781
...enlisting the help of the people
of this valley in their search...

468
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,576
...and they all disappeared.

469
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:10,910
Where did they go?

470
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:14,873
No one knows.

471
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,751
The Vatican ordered a cover-up...

472
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,879
...the false graveyard.

473
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:24,257
The tale of a plague to...

474
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,843
To scare people away.

475
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,179
And then the British
stumbled across it.

476
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:32,932
And I was sent here to see
if the legend was real.

477
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,435
What legend?

478
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,188
That after the war in heaven...

479
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:40,940
...this is the spot where Lucifer fell.

480
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:54,537
God brought you here, Lankester.

481
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,082
Leave me alone.

482
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:58,958
No.

483
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,502
No.

484
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,338
The devil is here...

485
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:05,048
...inside that boy.

486
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:06,800
The Turkana know it.

487
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:10,512
They came to drive the devil from him,
and he almost killed them.

488
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,473
You can't run from this.

489
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,975
You must help me.

490
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:18,645
I can't.

491
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:22,732
But you've seen what's going on here.

492
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,235
You have to believe.

493
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,573
I believe in nothing.

494
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,496
They've found Jefferies.

495
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:00,687
Major Granville. Wait.

496
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:36,556
Get him down.

497
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:41,060
Get him down.

498
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:51,154
You all right, major?

499
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:56,576
Savages.

500
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,127
Major.

501
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,254
Major!

502
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:20,225
- Bloody savages.
- Why are you here?

503
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:24,103
- Granville!
- You have no business to be here!

504
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,147
- You must leave.
- Granville!

505
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:28,525
You people have plundered
our ancestors.

506
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:32,111
- You must return Turkana to us now.
- Let me through!

507
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:35,198
It's time to go.
You have already polluted our lives.

508
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:37,534
You came here with your evil.

509
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,578
- We knew peace before you came.
- Granville!

510
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:45,458
No!

511
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:59,639
They think it's inside Joseph.
They believe the evil is upon us.

512
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:00,890
Chuma!

513
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:03,685
Merrin?

514
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:08,147
They believe it is inside Joseph.
They're going to kill him.

515
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:10,608
Now, please...

516
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,235
...go.

517
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:59,782
Sir, the Turkana are preparing
to attack.

518
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,369
Leave me.

519
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:06,205
Sir?

520
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,376
I said, leave me.

521
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:14,172
Yes, sir.

522
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:59,360
- We must leave now.
- Why?

523
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:03,072
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.

524
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,158
Take the boy to Nairobi.

525
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,326
Father Gionetti.

526
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,579
Why?

527
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:11,873
Turkana are coming to kill him.

528
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:23,801
It's a sandstorm.

529
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:31,809
It won't let us leave.

530
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:36,606
We have to hide him.

531
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,359
- The church.
- No.

532
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:44,447
The Turkana won't go in there.
It's his only chance.

533
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:49,035
- Aren't you coming?
- I have to find Sarah.

534
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:50,828
We'll meet you.

535
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,914
Francis.

536
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,881
Now go.

537
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:13,893
Sarah?

538
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:57,747
The Lord is coming for you.

539
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:30,029
Sarah?

540
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,365
Sarah?

541
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:13,698
Sarah?

542
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,339
Sarah!

543
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,901
Oh, my God.

544
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,821
Bession was Sarah's husband?

545
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:37,490
Yes.

546
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:40,493
She went into the church
with him, didn't she?

547
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:48,375
It's not Joseph.

548
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,169
It's Sarah.

549
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,005
Ready yourselves, men!

550
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,599
Fire!

551
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,742
Chuma.

552
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:12,246
Francis?

553
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:15,499
Francis?

554
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:37,229
Francis.

555
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:07,760
O, Lord, forgive my disbelief.

556
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:09,928
I need you.

557
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:13,599
These people need you.
This valley needs you.

558
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,268
Hear my cry...

559
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,896
Do not abandon me now.

560
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,425
Forgive my sins.

561
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:54,056
Joseph.

562
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:02,398
Come sit with us.

563
01:30:03,649 --> 01:30:05,776
I promise I won't bite.

564
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:08,654
Joseph, run.

565
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:13,117
He's mine.

566
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:14,952
Run.

567
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,209
Leave him alone.

568
01:30:22,418 --> 01:30:23,502
It's me you want.

569
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:33,011
I am a fallen priest.

570
01:30:40,436 --> 01:30:42,104
Lord, have mercy on us.

571
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:45,983
Christ, have mercy on us.
Lord, have mercy on us.

572
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:49,945
God, Father in heaven,
have mercy on us.

573
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:53,866
God, the Son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us.

574
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:57,202
God, the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us.

575
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,955
Christ, hear us.

576
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:04,418
Holy Mary, pray for us.

577
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,378
Christ, hear us.

578
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:09,173
Lord, have mercy on us.

579
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:11,216
What's the matter, Merrin?

580
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:13,760
Don't you wanna fuck me anymore?

581
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,227
All ye holy angels and archangels,
pray for us!

582
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:25,772
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits,
pray for us!

583
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:29,902
Why would he listen to you?

584
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,528
You.

585
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:33,197
You believe in nothing.

586
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:34,907
You're all alone.

587
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,909
Without hope.

588
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:47,377
Almighty Lord
and father of Jesus Christ...

589
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:50,839
...grant me, your unworthy servant,
pardon for my sins...

590
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,091
...and the power to fight this cruel...

591
01:32:09,316 --> 01:32:10,943
Joseph, come on.

592
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:15,447
- Don't be afraid.
- No! Father!

593
01:32:17,074 --> 01:32:20,786
- Joseph.
- Father Merrin...

594
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:23,163
Help me.

595
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:26,750
Joseph!

596
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:47,771
O, Lord...

597
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:50,691
...by your name, save me.

598
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:53,652
By your strength, defend my cause.

599
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,846
Joseph.

600
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:14,733
Joseph.

601
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:17,736
Joseph, wait.

602
01:34:20,364 --> 01:34:22,949
- Joseph.
- Father.

603
01:34:23,367 --> 01:34:24,951
I'm coming.

604
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:52,813
O, God, hear my prayer.

605
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:57,275
The ruthless seek my life.
They do not keep God before them.

606
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:02,030
Turn back the evil upon my foes.

607
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,659
In your faithfulness, destroy them.

608
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:34,938
Where is your God now, Merrin?

609
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:37,691
Fucking his only son
while you call his name?

610
01:35:37,858 --> 01:35:41,737
He doesn't care about this whore.
But you do...

611
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:45,615
...because you want to shove
your rotten cock up her juicy ass.

612
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,461
You can't have her, priest.
The whore is mine.

613
01:35:57,627 --> 01:36:00,338
And I'll kill her before I let you
take her from me.

614
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:07,304
From the souls made to the image
and likeness of God...

615
01:36:07,471 --> 01:36:08,805
...I cast you out!

616
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:12,934
You're a killer, Merrin.

617
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:16,146
You looked them in the eye
and pointed your finger and they died.

618
01:36:16,313 --> 01:36:20,066
God is not here today, priest.

619
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:24,237
Oh, yes, he is.

620
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:47,344
You're going to watch him die, Merrin.
Fail him like you failed all the others.

621
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:51,056
God, spare this child,
for he is innocent...

622
01:36:51,223 --> 01:36:56,269
...and deserves your blessing.
God, spare this child...

623
01:36:56,728 --> 01:37:00,440
...for he is innocent
and deserves your blessing.

624
01:37:00,607 --> 01:37:04,444
God, spare this child, for he is innocent
and deserves your blessing.

625
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:14,871
I command you to depart!
It's the power of Christ that compels you!

626
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:18,750
It is God who commands you.
It is Christ who commands you.

627
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:21,837
God, the Father, commands you.
God, the Son, commands you.

628
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:24,840
The Holy Spirit commands you.
The cross commands you.

629
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,384
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!

630
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:41,815
Lankester.

631
01:37:41,982 --> 01:37:45,026
Sarah, Sarah.

632
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:47,988
It's over now.

633
01:37:58,999 --> 01:38:01,501
Joseph, Joseph.

634
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:23,023
Father.

635
01:38:30,614 --> 01:38:33,909
Don't be afraid.
I need your help, Joseph.

636
01:38:39,748 --> 01:38:44,419
Listen, whatever you hear,
whatever you see, it's just his lies.

637
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:47,797
Don't listen. Don't watch.
You understand?

638
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,050
Don't listen!

639
01:38:50,467 --> 01:38:54,429
It's just lies. You have to be strong
and concentrate.

640
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:57,557
Can you read this?

641
01:38:57,724 --> 01:39:01,019
I will start there.
And then you will answer.

642
01:39:01,186 --> 01:39:04,940
That's me. That's you. That's me,
and that's you. You understand?

643
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:06,983
Good.

644
01:39:11,321 --> 01:39:12,864
Let's start.

645
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:18,203
O, God, by your name, save me.

646
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:19,913
"Amen."

647
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,873
Save your servant.

648
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:26,086
"Who places his trust in thee,
my God."

649
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,921
Be unto her, O, Lord, a fortified tower.

650
01:39:29,089 --> 01:39:30,715
"In the face of the enemy."

651
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:33,552
O, Lord, hear my prayer.

652
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:36,346
"And let my cry come unto thee."

653
01:39:36,513 --> 01:39:39,933
- The Lord be with you.
- "And also with you."

654
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:49,442
Begone, evil spirit...

655
01:39:50,568 --> 01:39:54,114
...in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

656
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,324
...and of the Holy Ghost.

657
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:02,247
By the sign of this Holy Cross...

658
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:06,418
...by our Lord Jesus Christ...

659
01:40:07,794 --> 01:40:10,213
...God, the Holy Ghost,
commands you!

660
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:16,469
The blood of the martyrs
commands you!

661
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:22,726
In God's name, demon!

662
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:27,313
I cast you out!

663
01:40:42,996 --> 01:40:44,831
Sarah.

664
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:09,439
Sarah.

665
01:41:25,497 --> 01:41:27,207
Okay?

666
01:41:45,725 --> 01:41:47,519
Thank you.

667
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:08,706
Sarah. What is it?

668
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:11,668
What is it, Sarah?

669
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:16,965
Help. Help!

670
01:42:17,132 --> 01:42:19,008
- Lankester.
- No.

671
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:20,885
Help.

672
01:42:22,137 --> 01:42:24,848
- No.
- Help.

673
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:27,100
Sarah.

674
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:35,418
Father.

675
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,967
She's with God now.

676
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:48,097
She's with God.

677
01:45:20,732 --> 01:45:23,234
I trust your mission was successful.

678
01:45:29,407 --> 01:45:32,201
I couldn't find
what you were looking for.

679
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:35,371
But you found something.

680
01:45:35,538 --> 01:45:37,415
Didn't you?

681
01:45:44,714 --> 01:45:46,257
Goodbye, Mr. Semelier.

682
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,551
<i>Au revoir</i>, Mr. Merrin.

683
01:45:49,344 --> 01:45:50,928
It's Father Merrin.
