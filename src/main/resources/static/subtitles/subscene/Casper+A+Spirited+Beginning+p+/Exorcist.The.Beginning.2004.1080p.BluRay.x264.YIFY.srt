1
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,838
Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.

2
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:32,041
They're crap, squirrel. They fall apart
before you're out of the door.

3
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:34,710
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!

4
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,686
Please.

5
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:40,349
My sister, she's very, very sick.

6
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,553
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

7
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:46,654
- Do you know my mother?
- No.

8
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:50,360
She's very, very sick.

9
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:52,426
I'll give you two.

10
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,972
That's a bad idea, you know.

11
00:04:57,042 --> 00:05:00,500
Like feeding pigeons.

12
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:07,182
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.

13
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:09,744
I work for a private collector
of rare antiquities.

14
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:13,053
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.

15
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,059
And I didn't answer.

16
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:18,563
There's been a discovery
in East Africa.

17
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:21,225
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

18
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,928
No, it's not possible.

19
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:26,563
The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity at that time...

20
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,005
but they never got that far south.

21
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,872
Nevertheless, there it sits.

22
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:34,845
The British have financed
a dig to uncover this church.

23
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,075
We believe a rare object waits inside.

24
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:40,346
We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

25
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,853
So you think I'm a thief?

26
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:49,759
Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

27
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:52,524
No. Simply a man
who's lost faith...

28
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:54,725
in everything except himself.

29
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,770
Ah.
You know nothing about me.

30
00:05:57,837 --> 00:06:00,067
You're an Oxford-educated
archaeologist...

31
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,301
an expert in religious icons.

32
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:06,209
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?

33
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:17,813
This is a leather impression of
the artifact we're looking for...

34
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:21,793
a representation
of a mythical demon.

35
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:43,172
It's Sumerian. What makes you
think it's in a church in Africa?

36
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,945
A Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

37
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:48,920
He's been persuaded to let you join it.

38
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:51,787
You're assuming that I will say yes.

39
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,418
You already have.

40
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:59,023
March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.

41
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,796
Left. Left, right, left.

42
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:05,361
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

43
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,339
Left.

44
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:10,775
Left, right, left.

45
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:13,678
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

46
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:25,820
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.

47
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,293
Beautiful, aren't they?

48
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:36,268
It's a hobby from school days.

49
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:38,669
Works wonders for the nerves.

50
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:41,071
You should try it sometime.

51
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:45,073
What can you tell me about the dig?

52
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:50,211
The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district...

53
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:52,149
called Derati.

54
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,848
It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men...

55
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,857
on maneuvers there.

56
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:01,327
When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

57
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,923
What have they learned so far?

58
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:10,529
That it's a church
where no church should be.

59
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:13,005
This is Father Francis.

60
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,703
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

61
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:18,769
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

62
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:22,078
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.

63
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,552
I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

64
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:31,558
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you
didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.

65
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:35,084
I was actually headed to Kenya
to begin missionary work...

66
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:37,154
when Rome learned of the discovery.

67
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:41,533
They've asked me to make sure the site's
religious aspect have the proper consideration.

68
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,902
Hmm.

69
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:46,965
How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

70
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:48,806
We haven't...

71
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:51,073
officially.

72
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,980
You're both my guests.

73
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,417
Tell me, have you any theories
on who might have built this church?

74
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,649
Well, not until I've seen it.

75
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,920
Surely the Vatican has
some record of its creation.

76
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:06,121
I'm afraid not.

77
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,630
We're as in the dark
about it as you are.

78
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:27,775
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.

79
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:31,184
The British hired me as an interpreter.

80
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,023
What happened here?

81
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:41,531
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.

82
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:45,364
- How many died?
- All of them.

83
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,491
I'm Lancaster Merrin.

84
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:49,761
Major Granville should have contacted you
about my joining the dig.

85
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:53,326
He did.

86
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:57,741
Is something bothering you, mate?

87
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,570
No.

88
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:06,175
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?

89
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,550
I shouldn't...

90
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:11,112
but my will is weak.

91
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:15,054
Then you might just survive this place.

92
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:19,325
I understand you've uncovered
the church dome...

93
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:21,764
but that progress has slowed down.

94
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,802
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?

95
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:31,098
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster-- Lancaster Merrin.

96
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:35,972
You still haven't made it
by my room, Doctor.

97
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:40,542
I've been having this, uh,
swelling in the evening.

98
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:43,645
Thought you might have
something I could put on it.

99
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:45,656
How about a muzzle?

100
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:53,991
So how are the interior
excavations coming along?

101
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,534
- They're not.
- No?

102
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:58,763
Has the structure collapsed?

103
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:00,964
No, the church is perfect...

104
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,737
but none of the men will enter,
those we have left anyway.

105
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,176
Why's that?

106
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,778
I shall be leaving
for the dig in five minutes.

107
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:21,020
Well... pleasant fellow.

108
00:12:21,094 --> 00:12:23,494
What's wrong with his face?

109
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:26,794
Other than that it's
attached to his body?

110
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:30,165
Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind oflocalized infection.

111
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:34,172
Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

112
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,232
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.

113
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,438
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?

114
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:44,373
No. I'm a doctor.

115
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:47,443
But as a priest,
surely you must believe in such things.

116
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,545
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.

117
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:51,613
Now, that's funny.

118
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,524
I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

119
00:12:54,594 --> 00:12:57,961
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.

120
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:01,863
Father Merrin.

121
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:07,032
This is Emekwi.

122
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:10,703
He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

123
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:13,576
Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

124
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:17,378
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.

125
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:20,511
- Hello,James,Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.

126
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:23,682
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.

127
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:26,556
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.

128
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,255
James.Joseph.

129
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,725
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.

130
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:23,240
There's your goddamn church.

131
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,924
Is this your first assignment, Father?

132
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:38,329
Before this, I was studying
in the archives in the Holy Sea.

133
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,800
The Vatican.
Impressive.

134
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,861
But not really training
for missionary work, is it?

135
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:08,126
This is strange.

136
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:11,598
It's 1,500 years old.

137
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,965
It should be badly weathered.

138
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:18,097
It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

139
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:21,166
Chuma.

140
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:24,441
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.

141
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,346
Hyenas?

142
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,547
They've been here
ever since we started digging.

143
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:36,615
Even at daytime?

144
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:42,789
No! No! No!

145
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:47,862
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

146
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:51,031
The heat?

147
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,716
Joseph?

148
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:16,021
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

149
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:19,557
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.

150
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:22,867
I think you're about
ready for this now.

151
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,770
It's a tool for professional diggers.

152
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:30,108
Wow.

153
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,084
His seizure's stopped.

154
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:38,144
I wanted to keep him at the hospital
for observation...

155
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:41,214
but the Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

156
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,585
Well, that must make
your job very hard.

157
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,653
You have no idea.

158
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,127
Thank you.

159
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:55,103
So what is it you hope to find here?

160
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:59,905
The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.

161
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:05,280
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

162
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,945
Black bastards!
Bloody savages!

163
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:12,585
Can't wipe their own ass
without instruction.

164
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,627
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.

165
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:19,289
I, uh-- I found this...

166
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:21,595
and, uh, I want you to have it.

167
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,659
It's a St.Joseph, for luck.

168
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,905
Please, for my behavior.

169
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:37,779
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?

170
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,081
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!

171
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:43,849
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.

172
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,319
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.

173
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:51,556
It's okay. Come.

174
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,121
These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

175
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,133
How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

176
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,964
A few days.

177
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:01,871
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.

178
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,374
Chuma'll take you in
through the roof.

179
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,141
Following us, Father?

180
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,187
Is it safe to walk around?

181
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:25,248
Let's see.

182
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,943
Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.

183
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:51,007
Cast out after the war in heaven.

184
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:53,485
Can't even trust angels, can you?

185
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:08,767
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.

186
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:12,732
It's odd.

187
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:20,810
Churches were built to exalt heaven...

188
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:24,716
but this, the weapons
are pointing downward.

189
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:30,457
Look behind you, Father.

190
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:48,971
Desecration of Christ.

191
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:58,142
Who would do something like this?

192
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:03,855
The crucifix
was broken off from here.

193
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:06,393
Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

194
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:08,361
I wouldn't know.

195
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:11,025
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.

196
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,900
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

197
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:18,702
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.

198
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:21,572
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

199
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:23,874
He's gone mad.

200
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:33,514
No one's been inside Bession's tent
since he fell ill?

201
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:36,558
They are superstitious.

202
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:43,995
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.

203
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:47,159
- Chuma.
- Yes?

204
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,291
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.

205
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:58,731
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.

206
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,142
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?

207
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:04,806
The language spoken in Palestine
at the time of Christ.

208
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:08,180
And what does it say?

209
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,185
““The fallen shall rise...

210
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:12,984
in a river of blood.''

211
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,293
Do you have a moment?

212
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:54,229
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?

213
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:57,233
Or maybe something
more substantial?

214
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,531
Yes, that would be very nice.

215
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,338
You dabble in the occult?

216
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:08,473
I found them here when I arrived.

217
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,987
I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

218
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,816
You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

219
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,594
There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

220
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,136
He had no medical symptoms...

221
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:36,868
nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

222
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,173
His breakdown was purely mental
and extremely severe.

223
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,078
That's why the Turkana fear
the church is cursed.

224
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,514
That and the disappearances.

225
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,417
In the past few weeks,
we've lost a dozen men.

226
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,921
Runaways?

227
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,957
Or is it those evil spirits?

228
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,016
Yeah.

229
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:09,797
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.

230
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,073
My father was a strong man.

231
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,774
When the Nazis started
rounding up theJews in our town...

232
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,875
he didn't hesitate.

233
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:21,079
He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

234
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,247
But someone turned us in...

235
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,258
and we were all sent to
the concentration camps.

236
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:28,055
I'm sorry.

237
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:31,859
People can't really
understand, can they?

238
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:34,560
If they weren't there...

239
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:37,001
if they didn't see.

240
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,062
No.

241
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:44,508
And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

242
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:49,743
I met him after the war,
and we came to Africa together, in love.

243
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:53,810
One night I realized
I-- I had to tell him the truth...

244
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:56,379
about... the Nazis...

245
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:59,449
and what they did to me.

246
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:03,156
After that, he never touched me again.

247
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,529
So...

248
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,626
what turns a man of the cloth
into an archaeologist?

249
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:14,165
I don't know.
I suppose I--

250
00:26:14,242 --> 00:26:18,576
I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

251
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:21,115
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.

252
00:26:21,183 --> 00:26:23,344
No.

253
00:26:23,418 --> 00:26:26,785
There's no point in that.

254
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:30,052
Sometimes I think
the best view of God is from hell.

255
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,691
I should get to bed.

256
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:47,540
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow
to see Bession.

257
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:52,141
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?

258
00:26:52,214 --> 00:26:54,705
He runs the sanitarium.

259
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:57,581
Well, thank you...

260
00:26:57,652 --> 00:27:00,416
for the medical care.

261
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,160
Deliver us from evil...

262
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,165
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

263
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:13,497
Amen.

264
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,625
You, priest.
What is your name?

265
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:54,102
I'm Father Merrin.

266
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:13,352
God is not here today, priest.

267
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:41,310
Want some water?

268
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:51,027
Hey, what's wrong?

269
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:01,428
It's late.

270
00:30:01,506 --> 00:30:03,736
You should go back to bed.

271
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,084
Give it to me! It's mine!

272
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:17,884
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!

273
00:30:17,956 --> 00:30:20,925
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Here, take it.

274
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:22,790
- Take it!
- Oh,just give it to me, you idiot!

275
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:25,921
Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.

276
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,727
Give it to me!
It's mine.

277
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,530
- Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
- Just give it to me!

278
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:33,093
All right. Okay, okay.

279
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:36,573
Go back to bed,
and I'll give you the stupid thing.

280
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:50,922
Joseph, look out!

281
00:30:50,989 --> 00:30:53,219
Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!

282
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:56,056
Joseph, help me!

283
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:03,391
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.

284
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,015
No! Help me!

285
00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:47,880
Help! Help me!

286
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,006
Help me!

287
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:02,857
Help me!
Help me! Please!

288
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,999
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They toreJames apart.

289
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:22,071
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.

290
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,844
They were focused on his brother.

291
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:29,254
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.

292
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:51,567
Can you see?
Can you hear?

293
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,755
Come with me.

294
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:53,307
Monsieur Bession?

295
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:58,438
Mr. Bession.

296
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:00,675
You worked on a dig in Derati.

297
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,554
You drew a picture of an idol.

298
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:11,457
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?

299
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,291
Mr. Bession.

300
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:18,163
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?

301
00:34:18,234 --> 00:34:21,261
I said how do you know my name?

302
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:33,411
Are you hurt?

303
00:34:33,483 --> 00:34:35,474
No.

304
00:34:42,526 --> 00:34:44,517
I'm free.

305
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:52,161
God is not here today, priest.

306
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:37,406
I hope he finds peace.

307
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:40,917
I'm Father Gionetti.

308
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:43,545
I've been waiting for you.

309
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:46,351
How did he know my name?

310
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:49,450
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

311
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:53,160
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

312
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:56,029
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

313
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,035
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

314
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:03,039
So, "touched."
What does that mean?

315
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:07,237
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

316
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:10,109
was plagued by possession.

317
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:12,775
Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

318
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,841
committing unspeakable acts.

319
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:18,616
Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

320
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:23,024
Simply horny... and inventive.

321
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:27,930
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

322
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,800
Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

323
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,328
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

324
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:37,898
with evil.

325
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:41,969
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

326
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:44,743
And that evil remains in Derati.

327
00:36:44,817 --> 00:36:47,980
You must be careful there.

328
00:36:48,053 --> 00:36:52,046
Remember, he is the father of lies.

329
00:36:52,124 --> 00:36:55,582
He will seek to poison your mind.

330
00:36:55,661 --> 00:36:58,653
You will need this against him.

331
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:04,563
The Roman Rituals.

332
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:08,367
If you need somebody to perform
an exorcism, I'm not your man.

333
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,431
I'm not a priest anymore.

334
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:13,137
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.

335
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,440
Only your faith can save you.

336
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:18,676
Well, then I'm doomed.

337
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:19,667
Joseph?

338
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:42,292
What do you have there?

339
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:48,707
Can I see?

340
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:13,165
You threw it away.

341
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:18,102
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.

342
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:21,141
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn't.

343
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:24,177
- The clasp must have come loose--
- Liar!

344
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:29,983
Do I repulse you that much?

345
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:33,111
Maybe if you could cure
my fucking face...

346
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:36,487
I might look as good to you
as that archaeologist.

347
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:44,665
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.

348
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:47,258
What?

349
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:50,133
He's coming for you.

350
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,543
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.

351
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:08,486
Ohh.

352
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:10,524
Don't worry.

353
00:40:10,592 --> 00:40:12,651
You'll be fine.

354
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,574
Where is everybody?

355
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:37,176
Sebituana's baby is coming,
so the village has gathered in welcome.

356
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:38,982
Oh.

357
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:10,147
Joseph. Hey.

358
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:22,454
Joseph.

359
00:41:32,275 --> 00:41:34,140
You're back.

360
00:41:34,211 --> 00:41:38,147
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.

361
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:42,242
These lesions--
they're not from the shock, are they?

362
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,220
No.
They're completely asymptomatic.

363
00:41:45,288 --> 00:41:47,483
Itjust doesn't make sense.

364
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:50,321
- He should have recovered by now.
- So what is it?

365
00:41:50,393 --> 00:41:52,861
In this part of the world...

366
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:55,489
it could be a dozen things...

367
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:58,295
but his symptoms don't
really match any of them.

368
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:00,893
So all I can do
is just watch and wait.

369
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:07,532
I have to do some work up at the dig.

370
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,842
- Will you be all right?
- Hmm. Yes.

371
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:17,710
Come sit with me, Lancaster.

372
00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:21,289
I promise I won't bite.

373
00:42:29,635 --> 00:42:31,796
What is it?

374
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,203
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.

375
00:42:35,274 --> 00:42:38,505
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.

376
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,378
- How?
- I don't know.

377
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:47,441
Some accident.

378
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:07,839
I just don't understand everything
that's happening here.

379
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:10,704
It seems like I can't
help anyone anymore.

380
00:43:12,744 --> 00:43:14,974
Hey.

381
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:19,411
Easy.

382
00:44:45,906 --> 00:44:47,931
Help me hold him.

383
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:33,137
Emekwi. I'm doing
everything I can for him.

384
00:56:27,352 --> 00:56:29,343
Joseph?

385
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:40,621
It's this place, Lancaster.
The Turkana are right.

386
00:58:40,688 --> 00:58:43,452
- It's cursed.
- Sarah.

387
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:45,516
You don't understand.

388
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:50,524
What they did to me
in the camp. They--

389
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:54,358
There's nothing left to bleed.

390
00:58:56,104 --> 00:58:59,198
There is something here,
something evil.

391
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:02,801
Sarah, it's so much easier
to believe in evil as an entity...

392
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:04,811
but it's not.

393
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:08,610
It's a purely human condition
inside all of us.

394
00:59:10,185 --> 00:59:13,382
Did Bession talk about
what he found under the church?

395
00:59:15,323 --> 00:59:17,985
There's an ancient temple below,
a pagan place...

396
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:21,359
where they used to conduct sacrifices,
human sacrifices.

397
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,797
Why would they build a church
on top of something like that?

398
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:27,495
Perhaps to purify the site.

399
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:29,868
But then why bury it?

400
01:00:03,306 --> 01:00:05,604
No!

401
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:17,677
Merrin!

402
01:00:17,754 --> 01:00:20,279
You better come with me.

403
01:00:20,357 --> 01:00:22,848
Jefferies didn't show up
for the dig this morning.

404
01:00:22,926 --> 01:00:27,056
He wasn't in his room,
so they came to the bar and they found--

405
01:01:13,577 --> 01:01:16,842
Chief Sebituana's baby
was stillborn last night.

406
01:01:16,914 --> 01:01:18,848
He blames the whites.

407
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:20,941
You think the Turkana tookJefferies?

408
01:01:21,018 --> 01:01:24,112
I think this place
is on the verge of an uprising.

409
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:26,088
I've contacted Major Granville.

410
01:01:26,157 --> 01:01:29,285
A detachment will be here
by this afternoon.

411
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,487
You disagree?

412
01:01:33,264 --> 01:01:36,961
In my experience, bringing soldiers
into a situation is always a bad idea.

413
01:02:05,797 --> 01:02:07,788
Who buried them?

414
01:02:12,904 --> 01:02:15,065
Everybody died.

415
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:18,075
Who buried them?

416
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:42,858
All right! Halt!

417
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:44,869
- Major Granville.
- Hello, Peter.

418
01:02:44,937 --> 01:02:47,770
Come on! Out you get!
Move it, Wilkins!

419
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:52,971
- Any answers on Jefferies?
- I'm afraid not.

420
01:02:53,046 --> 01:02:56,504
Well, you did the right thing
calling me, Father.

421
01:02:56,582 --> 01:02:59,676
I've been in these situations before...

422
01:02:59,752 --> 01:03:02,186
and you have to stay on top of--

423
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:09,052
on top of these people.

424
01:03:09,128 --> 01:03:13,087
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible
for what's happening here, Major.

425
01:03:16,436 --> 01:03:19,303
Major Granville?

426
01:03:20,873 --> 01:03:23,740
This dig is too important to jeopardize...

427
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:26,870
and until I'm satisfied
that the excavation is secure...

428
01:03:26,946 --> 01:03:29,471
the British Army will
assume complete control.

429
01:03:29,549 --> 01:03:31,278
The Turkana won't like
the show of force.

430
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,751
I'm not concerned with
what the Turkana like, Mr. Merrin!

431
01:03:34,821 --> 01:03:38,279
If they start any more trouble,
they will have to answer...

432
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:41,952
to the might
of His Majesty King George.

433
01:03:47,835 --> 01:03:49,769
You cannot be here.

434
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:52,772
Please tell Sebituana
I'm sorry for his loss.

435
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,071
You are not welcome here.

436
01:03:56,143 --> 01:04:00,170
I want to know about the plague
that destroyed this village 50 years ago.

437
01:04:00,247 --> 01:04:02,272
It was not a plague.

438
01:04:04,818 --> 01:04:06,752
So, what was it?

439
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,084
The evil in your church...

440
01:04:09,156 --> 01:04:11,989
it has taken Emekwi's youngest son...

441
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:14,084
and it is getting stronger.

442
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:17,289
You must abandon your work...

443
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:20,162
or we'll be forced to stop you.

444
01:04:20,234 --> 01:04:23,169
So you don't want to tell me?

445
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:33,976
He says he doesn't have to tell you
because it's happening again...

446
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,277
right now.

447
01:05:03,711 --> 01:05:07,670
- You don't bury your dead. You cremate them.
- Yes.

448
01:05:07,749 --> 01:05:10,240
Then who's buried in that graveyard?

449
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:55,763
I'm sorry.

450
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:24,825
What are you--

451
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:07,002
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.

452
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:48,197
I will shoot 10, priest,
and you will choose.

453
01:08:48,273 --> 01:08:50,868
I can't do that.

454
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:01,484
No! No!

455
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,681
Now you choose...

456
01:09:03,756 --> 01:09:05,747
or I will kill them all.

457
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:11,996
Are you praying...

458
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,554
to God?

459
01:09:14,634 --> 01:09:16,397
Shoot me.

460
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,401
God is not here today, priest.

461
01:10:03,217 --> 01:10:06,516
Papa!

462
01:10:43,757 --> 01:10:45,691
- They're empty!
- What?

463
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,250
I dug up three graves.
They were all empty. What happened here?

464
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:50,854
- I-I don't know.
- Oh, yes, you do.

465
01:10:50,932 --> 01:10:53,867
- You've been lying to me since we got here.
- Let go of me.

466
01:10:53,935 --> 01:10:56,199
Damn it!
There are crosses on the graves!

467
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:58,205
There are crosses on the coffins!

468
01:10:58,273 --> 01:11:01,003
The church buried them, didn't they?

469
01:11:01,075 --> 01:11:02,940
Didn't they?

470
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:05,002
Yes.

471
01:11:05,079 --> 01:11:07,013
Why?

472
01:11:07,081 --> 01:11:09,515
What were they hiding?

473
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:12,075
That this place is damned.

474
01:11:12,153 --> 01:11:15,418
No! You asked the question!
Now you're gonna listen to the answer!

475
01:11:16,424 --> 01:11:19,325
There was a massacre here...

476
01:11:19,394 --> 01:11:22,124
1,500 years ago.

477
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:25,188
An army from the west,
led by two priests...

478
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:29,092
searching for the origin
of a powerful evil.

479
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:32,606
But when they got here
that evil consumed them...

480
01:11:32,674 --> 01:11:35,939
turning the soldiers
against each other in a bloodbath.

481
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:38,478
Only a single priest survived.

482
01:11:38,546 --> 01:11:41,481
When that priest made it back
to the EmperorJustinian...

483
01:11:41,549 --> 01:11:44,985
he ordered that a church
be built over the site and then buried...

484
01:11:45,053 --> 01:11:46,987
to seal the evil inside.

485
01:11:47,055 --> 01:11:50,252
All mention of it was to be stricken
from the history texts forever.

486
01:11:50,325 --> 01:11:52,260
But it wasn't?

487
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:55,024
No.

488
01:11:55,097 --> 01:11:57,361
In 1893...

489
01:11:57,433 --> 01:12:01,460
a Vatican researcher
found an ancient letter in the archives.

490
01:12:01,537 --> 01:12:04,062
Four priests came
to examine the site...

491
01:12:04,139 --> 01:12:07,575
enlisting the help of the people
of this valley in their search...

492
01:12:07,643 --> 01:12:10,339
and they all disappeared.

493
01:12:10,412 --> 01:12:12,676
Where did they go?

494
01:12:12,748 --> 01:12:14,739
No one knows.

495
01:12:16,185 --> 01:12:18,983
The Vatican ordered a cover-up--

496
01:12:19,054 --> 01:12:21,488
the false graveyard...

497
01:12:21,557 --> 01:12:24,617
the tale of a plague to--

498
01:12:25,694 --> 01:12:27,594
to scare people away.

499
01:12:27,663 --> 01:12:29,927
And then the British
stumbled across it.

500
01:12:29,999 --> 01:12:33,662
And I was sent here
to see if the legend was real.

501
01:12:33,736 --> 01:12:36,204
What legend?

502
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:39,104
That after the war in heaven...

503
01:12:39,174 --> 01:12:41,665
this is the spot where Lucifer fell.

504
01:12:52,756 --> 01:12:55,691
God brought you here, Lancaster.

505
01:12:55,759 --> 01:12:57,886
Leave me alone.

506
01:12:57,961 --> 01:12:59,895
No.

507
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:01,897
No.

508
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:03,830
The devil is here...

509
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,834
inside that boy.

510
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:07,836
The Turkana know it.

511
01:13:07,904 --> 01:13:11,840
They came to drive the devil from him,
and he almost killed them.

512
01:13:11,908 --> 01:13:14,172
You can't run from this.

513
01:13:14,244 --> 01:13:16,576
You must help me.

514
01:13:17,781 --> 01:13:20,215
I can't.

515
01:13:20,283 --> 01:13:23,218
But you've seen what's going on here.

516
01:13:23,286 --> 01:13:25,777
You have to believe.

517
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:31,226
I believe in nothing.

518
01:13:35,565 --> 01:13:37,260
Found Jefferies.

519
01:13:56,253 --> 01:13:57,948
- Over there!
- As you were!

520
01:13:58,022 --> 01:14:01,048
Major Granville!
Wait!

521
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:37,283
Get him down.

522
01:14:40,297 --> 01:14:42,288
Get him down!

523
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:52,132
You all right, Major?

524
01:14:53,912 --> 01:14:56,346
Savages.

525
01:15:05,056 --> 01:15:08,355
Major! Major!

526
01:15:18,003 --> 01:15:20,972
- Bloody savages.
- Why are you here?

527
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:23,906
- Granville!
- You have no business to be here!

528
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,844
- You must leave.
- Granville!

529
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:29,278
- You people have plundered our ancestors.
- Granville!

530
01:15:29,347 --> 01:15:31,781
You must return Turkana to us now.

531
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,943
- Let me through!
- It is time to go.

532
01:15:34,019 --> 01:15:35,953
You have already polluted our lives.

533
01:15:36,021 --> 01:15:40,321
You came here with your evil.
We knew peace before you came.

534
01:15:40,392 --> 01:15:42,121
Granville!

535
01:15:43,762 --> 01:15:47,198
No!

536
01:15:47,265 --> 01:15:51,031
No! No!

537
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:56,002
No!

538
01:15:56,075 --> 01:15:59,738
They think it's insideJoseph!
They believe the evil is upon us!

539
01:15:59,812 --> 01:16:01,677
Chuma!

540
01:16:01,747 --> 01:16:03,476
Merrin.

541
01:16:05,084 --> 01:16:07,882
They believe it is inside Joseph.

542
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:09,922
They are going to kill him.

543
01:16:09,989 --> 01:16:12,651
Now, please... go!

544
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:18,828
You animals!

545
01:16:46,126 --> 01:16:49,027
- Turn this way!
- I don't like it. Come on!

546
01:16:51,865 --> 01:16:55,266
Three boxes of ammunition!

547
01:16:57,238 --> 01:17:00,264
Sir. The Turkana
are preparing to attack.

548
01:17:02,277 --> 01:17:04,108
Leave me.

549
01:17:05,647 --> 01:17:07,638
Sir?

550
01:17:09,617 --> 01:17:11,608
I said, leave me.

551
01:17:13,288 --> 01:17:15,279
Yes, sir.

552
01:18:57,126 --> 01:18:59,061
We must leave now.

553
01:18:59,129 --> 01:19:01,063
Why?

554
01:19:01,131 --> 01:19:03,565
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.

555
01:19:03,633 --> 01:19:05,897
Take the boy to Nairobi.

556
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:08,096
Father Gionetti.

557
01:19:08,171 --> 01:19:10,332
Why?

558
01:19:10,407 --> 01:19:12,398
Turkana are coming to kill him.

559
01:19:22,485 --> 01:19:24,544
It's a sandstorm.

560
01:19:30,527 --> 01:19:32,552
It won't let us leave.

561
01:19:35,999 --> 01:19:39,059
We have to hide him.

562
01:19:39,135 --> 01:19:41,126
- The church.
- No!

563
01:19:41,204 --> 01:19:43,138
The Turkana won't go in there.

564
01:19:43,206 --> 01:19:45,174
It's his only chance.

565
01:19:47,177 --> 01:19:49,805
- Aren't you coming?
- I have to find Sarah.

566
01:19:49,879 --> 01:19:51,574
We'll meet you.

567
01:19:51,648 --> 01:19:53,616
Francis!

568
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:01,719
Now go.

569
01:20:12,837 --> 01:20:14,668
Sarah?

570
01:21:56,575 --> 01:21:58,509
The Lord is coming for you.

571
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:30,799
Sarah?

572
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:32,468
Sarah!

573
01:22:35,481 --> 01:22:40,976
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sanctu.

574
01:22:47,393 --> 01:22:50,157
- Steady now!
- Pick it up, mate!

575
01:23:11,318 --> 01:23:13,149
Sarah?

576
01:23:28,335 --> 01:23:29,962
Sarah!

577
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:32,956
Oh, my God.

578
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,560
Bession was Sarah's husband?

579
01:24:36,637 --> 01:24:38,229
Yes.

580
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:42,073
She went into the church
with him, didn't she?

581
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:50,946
It's notJoseph.
It's Sarah.

582
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,953
Sancti Michael Archangel--

583
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:35,764
Ready yourselves, men!

584
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:47,032
Fire!

585
01:26:03,093 --> 01:26:05,084
Chuma!

586
01:28:11,857 --> 01:28:14,155
Francis?

587
01:28:14,226 --> 01:28:16,251
Francis.

588
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:37,979
Francis.

589
01:29:05,211 --> 01:29:08,704
O Lord, forgive my disbelief.

590
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:10,716
I need you.

591
01:29:10,784 --> 01:29:14,345
These people need you.
This valley needs you.

592
01:29:14,421 --> 01:29:17,049
Hear my cry.

593
01:29:17,124 --> 01:29:19,285
Do not abandon me now.

594
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:48,919
Forgive my sins.

595
01:29:52,793 --> 01:29:55,353
Joseph.

596
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:03,168
Come sit with us, Lancaster.

597
01:30:04,337 --> 01:30:06,533
I promise I won't bite!

598
01:30:06,607 --> 01:30:09,405
Joseph, run.

599
01:30:12,747 --> 01:30:14,772
- He's mine.
- Run!

600
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:25,316
Leave him alone.
It's me you want.

601
01:30:31,933 --> 01:30:33,798
I am a fallen priest.

602
01:30:40,274 --> 01:30:42,208
Lord, have mercy on us.

603
01:30:42,276 --> 01:30:44,767
Christ, have mercy on us.

604
01:30:44,846 --> 01:30:47,246
Lord, have mercy on us.

605
01:30:47,315 --> 01:30:49,749
God, Father in heaven,
have mercy on us.

606
01:30:51,319 --> 01:30:54,413
God, the Son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us.

607
01:30:54,489 --> 01:30:57,788
God, the Holy Spirit,
have mercy on us.

608
01:30:57,859 --> 01:31:00,726
Christ, hear us.

609
01:31:02,463 --> 01:31:05,091
Holy Mary, pray for us.

610
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:07,157
Christ, hear us.

611
01:31:08,704 --> 01:31:11,537
- Lord, have mercy on us.
- What's the matter, Merrin?

612
01:31:11,607 --> 01:31:13,598
Don't you want to
fuck me anymore?

613
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,108
All ye holy angels and archangels...

614
01:31:21,183 --> 01:31:23,014
pray for us!

615
01:31:23,085 --> 01:31:26,521
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits,
pray for us!

616
01:31:26,588 --> 01:31:30,547
Why would he listen to you?

617
01:31:30,626 --> 01:31:32,457
You.

618
01:31:32,528 --> 01:31:35,691
You believe in nothing.
You're all alone.

619
01:31:35,764 --> 01:31:37,664
Without hope.

620
01:31:43,438 --> 01:31:46,100
Almighty Lord...

621
01:31:46,175 --> 01:31:48,166
and father ofJesus Christ...

622
01:31:48,243 --> 01:31:51,212
grant me, your unworthy servant,
pardon for all my sins...

623
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,805
and the power to fight this cruel--

624
01:32:10,099 --> 01:32:13,557
Joseph, come on.
Don't be afraid.

625
01:32:13,636 --> 01:32:16,161
No! Father!

626
01:32:17,106 --> 01:32:19,040
Joseph!

627
01:32:19,108 --> 01:32:22,509
Father, help me!

628
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:25,343
- Help me! Help me!
- Joseph!

629
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:28,612
Father Merrin!

630
01:32:28,685 --> 01:32:31,449
Merrin!

631
01:32:47,403 --> 01:32:51,396
O Lord, by your name save me.

632
01:32:52,508 --> 01:32:54,408
By your strength
defend my cause.

633
01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:26,939
No!

634
01:34:00,979 --> 01:34:02,844
- Father!
- Joseph?

635
01:34:13,559 --> 01:34:16,357
Joseph!Joseph!

636
01:34:16,429 --> 01:34:18,420
Wait!

637
01:34:20,066 --> 01:34:22,034
Joseph.

638
01:34:22,101 --> 01:34:23,932
Father!

639
01:34:24,003 --> 01:34:25,994
I'm coming.

640
01:34:50,463 --> 01:34:53,557
O God, hear my prayer.

641
01:34:53,632 --> 01:34:55,862
The ruthless seek my life.

642
01:34:55,935 --> 01:34:59,234
They do not keep God before them.

643
01:34:59,305 --> 01:35:01,671
Turn back the evil upon my foes.

644
01:35:03,442 --> 01:35:06,411
In your faithfulness destroy them.

645
01:35:34,007 --> 01:35:35,668
Where's your God now, Merrin?

646
01:35:35,742 --> 01:35:38,404
Fucking his only son
while you call out his name?

647
01:35:38,478 --> 01:35:41,379
He doesn't care about this whore.

648
01:35:41,448 --> 01:35:43,143
But you do...

649
01:35:43,216 --> 01:35:46,344
because you want to
shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass.

650
01:35:55,595 --> 01:35:57,893
You can't have her, priest.
The whore is mine.

651
01:35:57,964 --> 01:36:01,058
And I'll kill her before
I let you take her from me.

652
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:08,032
From the souls made to
the image and likeness of God...

653
01:36:08,108 --> 01:36:09,939
I cast you out!

654
01:36:11,712 --> 01:36:13,703
You're a killer, Merrin.

655
01:36:13,781 --> 01:36:16,875
You looked them in the eye,
pointed your finger, and they died.

656
01:36:16,951 --> 01:36:20,819
God is not here today, priest.

657
01:36:23,624 --> 01:36:25,421
Oh, yes, he is.

658
01:36:43,377 --> 01:36:45,242
You're going to watch him die, Merrin.

659
01:36:45,313 --> 01:36:48,146
Fail him like you failed all the others.

660
01:36:48,216 --> 01:36:51,777
God, spare this child,
for he is innocent...

661
01:36:51,853 --> 01:36:53,753
and deserves your blessing.

662
01:36:53,821 --> 01:36:57,018
God, spare this child...

663
01:36:57,091 --> 01:36:58,854
for he is innocent...

664
01:36:58,926 --> 01:37:01,190
and deserves your blessing.

665
01:37:01,262 --> 01:37:05,164
God, spare this child, for he is innocent
and deserves your blessing.

666
01:37:10,905 --> 01:37:14,433
I command you to depart!
It's the power of Christ that compels you!

667
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:17,172
It is God himself who commands you.

668
01:37:17,246 --> 01:37:19,510
It's the majestic Christ who commands you!

669
01:37:19,581 --> 01:37:21,879
God, the Father, commands you.
God, the Son, commands you.

670
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:23,713
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

671
01:37:23,785 --> 01:37:25,548
The mystery of the cross commands you!

672
01:37:25,621 --> 01:37:28,146
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!

673
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:43,961
- Lancaster.
- Sarah.

674
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:46,303
Sarah.

675
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:48,741
It's over now.

676
01:37:58,754 --> 01:38:00,813
Joseph.

677
01:38:00,889 --> 01:38:03,687
Joseph.

678
01:38:17,173 --> 01:38:19,767
Merrin!

679
01:38:19,842 --> 01:38:22,504
Father!

680
01:38:30,186 --> 01:38:32,620
Don't be afraid.

681
01:38:32,689 --> 01:38:34,623
I need your help,Joseph.

682
01:38:39,996 --> 01:38:44,592
Listen, whatever you hear,
whatever you see, it's just his lies.

683
01:38:44,667 --> 01:38:48,535
Don't listen. Don't watch.
You understand?

684
01:38:48,605 --> 01:38:51,073
Don't listen!

685
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:55,201
It's just lies.
You have to be strong and concentrate.

686
01:38:55,278 --> 01:38:58,270
Can you read this?

687
01:38:58,348 --> 01:39:01,749
I will start there.
Then you will answer.

688
01:39:01,818 --> 01:39:03,945
That's me. That's you.
That's me, and that's you.

689
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,885
You understand?

690
01:39:05,955 --> 01:39:07,752
Good.

691
01:39:09,959 --> 01:39:12,587
Let's start.

692
01:39:14,131 --> 01:39:16,065
O God...

693
01:39:16,133 --> 01:39:18,931
by your name save me.

694
01:39:19,003 --> 01:39:20,630
““Amen.''

695
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:22,604
Save your servant.

696
01:39:22,673 --> 01:39:26,666
““Who places his trust in thee, my God.''

697
01:39:26,744 --> 01:39:29,679
Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.

698
01:39:29,747 --> 01:39:31,476
““In the face of the enemy.''

699
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:34,278
O Lord, hear my prayer.

700
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:37,115
““And let my cry come unto thee.''

701
01:39:37,187 --> 01:39:40,679
- The Lord be with you.
- ““And also with you.''

702
01:39:47,898 --> 01:39:50,196
Begone, evil spirit...

703
01:39:50,267 --> 01:39:54,829
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

704
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:57,339
and of the Holy Ghost!

705
01:40:00,544 --> 01:40:02,978
By the sign of this holy cross...

706
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,542
by our Lord Jesus Christ...

707
01:40:08,452 --> 01:40:10,943
God, the Holy Ghost, commands you!

708
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:17,186
The blood of the martyrs commands you!

709
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:23,465
In God's name, demon...

710
01:40:24,703 --> 01:40:28,070
I cast you out!

711
01:40:43,655 --> 01:40:46,146
Sarah?

712
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,871
Sarah.

713
01:41:25,664 --> 01:41:27,655
Okay?

714
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:48,315
Thank you.

715
01:42:05,105 --> 01:42:07,039
Look, um--

716
01:42:07,107 --> 01:42:09,473
Sarah, what is it?

717
01:42:09,543 --> 01:42:11,977
What is it, Sarah?

718
01:42:12,045 --> 01:42:14,036
What is it, Sarah?

719
01:42:15,515 --> 01:42:18,508
Lancaster!

720
01:42:18,586 --> 01:42:20,850
- No!
- Help--

721
01:42:20,922 --> 01:42:22,753
Sarah.

722
01:42:22,824 --> 01:42:25,019
- No!
- Help--

723
01:42:26,661 --> 01:42:28,652
Sarah.

724
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:36,188
Father?

725
01:43:41,703 --> 01:43:43,728
She's with God now.

726
01:43:46,441 --> 01:43:48,875
She's with God.

727
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:24,002
I trust your mission was successful.

728
01:45:29,913 --> 01:45:33,474
I couldn't find
what you were looking for.

729
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:36,144
But you found something.

730
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,620
Didn't you?

731
01:45:45,129 --> 01:45:47,063
Good-bye, Mr. Semelier.

732
01:45:47,131 --> 01:45:49,326
Au revoir, Mr. Merrin.

733
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,698
It's Father Merrin.
