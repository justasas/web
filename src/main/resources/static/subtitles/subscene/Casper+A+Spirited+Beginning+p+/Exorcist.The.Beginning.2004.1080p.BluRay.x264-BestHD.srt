1
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,938
Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.

2
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:33,141
They're crap, squirrel. They fall apart
before you're out of the door.

3
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:35,810
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!

4
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:37,786
Please.

5
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:41,449
My sister, she's very, very sick.

6
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:44,653
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

7
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:47,754
- Do you know my mother?
- No.

8
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:51,460
She's very, very sick.

9
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,526
I'll give you two.

10
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:58,071
That's a bad idea, you know.

11
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:01,599
Like feeding pigeons.

12
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:08,281
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.

13
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:10,843
I work for a private collector
of rare antiquities.

14
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:14,152
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.

15
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:16,158
And I didn't answer.

16
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:19,662
There's been a discovery
in East Africa.

17
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,324
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

18
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,027
No, it's not possible.

19
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:27,662
The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity at that time...

20
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:30,104
but they never got that far south.

21
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:32,971
Nevertheless, there it sits.

22
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:35,944
The British have financed
a dig to uncover this church.

23
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,174
We believe a rare object waits inside.

24
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:41,445
We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

25
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:43,952
So you think I'm a thief?

26
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:50,858
Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

27
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:53,623
No. Simply a man
who's lost faith...

28
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:55,824
in everything except himself.

29
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,868
Ah.
You know nothing about me.

30
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:01,165
You're an Oxford-educated
archaeologist...

31
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,399
an expert in religious icons.

32
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:07,307
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?

33
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,911
This is a leather impression of
the artifact we're looking for...

34
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:22,891
a representation
of a mythical demon.

35
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,270
It's Sumerian. What makes you
think it's in a church in Africa?

36
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:47,043
A Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

37
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:50,018
He's been persuaded to let you join it.

38
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:52,885
You're assuming that I will say yes.

39
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:55,516
You already have.

40
00:06:55,592 --> 00:07:00,120
March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.

41
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:02,893
Left. Left, right, left.

42
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:06,458
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

43
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:08,436
Left.

44
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:11,872
Left, right, left.

45
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:14,775
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

46
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:26,917
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.

47
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:34,390
Beautiful, aren't they?

48
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:37,365
It's a hobby from school days.

49
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:39,766
Works wonders for the nerves.

50
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,168
You should try it sometime.

51
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,170
What can you tell me about the dig?

52
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:51,308
The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district...

53
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,246
called Derati.

54
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:56,945
It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men...

55
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,954
on maneuvers there.

56
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:02,423
When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

57
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:07,019
What have they learned so far?

58
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:11,625
That it's a church
where no church should be.

59
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,101
This is Father Francis.

60
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:16,799
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

61
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:19,865
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

62
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:23,174
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.

63
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:27,648
I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

64
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:32,654
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you
didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.

65
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:36,180
I was actually headed to Kenya
to begin missionary work...

66
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,250
when Rome learned of the discovery.

67
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:42,628
They've asked me to make sure the site's
religious aspect have the proper consideration.

68
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,997
Hmm.

69
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:48,060
How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

70
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:49,901
We haven't...

71
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:52,168
officially.

72
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:55,075
You're both my guests.

73
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:58,512
Tell me, have you any theories
on who might have built this church?

74
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:00,743
Well, not until I've seen it.

75
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:04,014
Surely the Vatican has
some record of its creation.

76
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:07,215
I'm afraid not.

77
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,724
We're as in the dark
about it as you are.

78
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:28,869
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.

79
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:32,278
The British hired me as an interpreter.

80
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:39,117
What happened here?

81
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,625
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.

82
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:46,458
- How many died?
- All of them.

83
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,584
I'm Lancaster Merrin.

84
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:50,854
Major Granville should have contacted you
about my joining the dig.

85
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:54,419
He did.

86
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:58,834
Is something bothering you, mate?

87
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:03,662
No.

88
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,267
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?

89
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,642
I shouldn't...

90
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:12,204
but my will is weak.

91
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,146
Then you might just survive this place.

92
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,417
I understand you've uncovered
the church dome...

93
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,856
but that progress has slowed down.

94
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:24,894
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?

95
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:32,190
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster-- Lancaster Merrin.

96
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,064
You still haven't made it
by my room, Doctor.

97
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,634
I've been having this, uh,
swelling in the evening.

98
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:44,737
Thought you might have
something I could put on it.

99
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:46,748
How about a muzzle?

100
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:55,083
So how are the interior
excavations coming along?

101
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:57,626
- They're not.
- No?

102
00:11:57,694 --> 00:11:59,855
Has the structure collapsed?

103
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,056
No, the church is perfect...

104
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,828
but none of the men will enter,
those we have left anyway.

105
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,267
Why's that?

106
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:12,869
I shall be leaving
for the dig in five minutes.

107
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:22,111
Well... pleasant fellow.

108
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,585
What's wrong with his face?

109
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:27,885
Other than that it's
attached to his body?

110
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:31,256
Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind oflocalized infection.

111
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:35,263
Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

112
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:38,323
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.

113
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:41,529
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?

114
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:45,464
No. I'm a doctor.

115
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,534
But as a priest,
surely you must believe in such things.

116
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,636
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.

117
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,704
Now, that's funny.

118
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:55,615
I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

119
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:59,052
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.

120
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,954
Father Merrin.

121
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,122
This is Emekwi.

122
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:11,793
He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

123
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:14,666
Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

124
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:18,468
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.

125
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,601
- Hello,James,Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.

126
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:24,772
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.

127
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:27,646
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.

128
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:30,345
James.Joseph.

129
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:33,815
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.

130
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:24,329
There's your goddamn church.

131
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:36,013
Is this your first assignment, Father?

132
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:39,418
Before this, I was studying
in the archives in the Holy Sea.

133
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:41,889
The Vatican.
Impressive.

134
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,950
But not really training
for missionary work, is it?

135
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,214
This is strange.

136
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,686
It's 1,500 years old.

137
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:15,053
It should be badly weathered.

138
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:19,185
It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

139
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:22,254
Chuma.

140
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:25,529
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.

141
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,434
Hyenas?

142
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:34,635
They've been here
ever since we started digging.

143
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:37,703
Even at daytime?

144
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:43,877
No! No! No!

145
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:48,950
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

146
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:52,119
The heat?

147
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,804
Joseph?

148
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,108
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

149
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,644
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.

150
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:23,954
I think you're about
ready for this now.

151
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,857
It's a tool for professional diggers.

152
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:31,195
Wow.

153
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:36,171
His seizure's stopped.

154
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,231
I wanted to keep him at the hospital
for observation...

155
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:42,301
but the Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

156
00:16:43,646 --> 00:16:46,672
Well, that must make
your job very hard.

157
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:48,740
You have no idea.

158
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:53,214
Thank you.

159
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:56,190
So what is it you hope to find here?

160
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:00,992
The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.

161
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:06,367
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

162
00:17:06,436 --> 00:17:09,030
Black bastards!
Bloody savages!

163
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:13,670
Can't wipe their own ass
without instruction.

164
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,712
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.

165
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:20,374
I, uh-- I found this...

166
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,680
and, uh, I want you to have it.

167
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:25,744
It's a St.Joseph, for luck.

168
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,990
Please, for my behavior.

169
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:38,864
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?

170
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:42,166
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!

171
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:44,934
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.

172
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,404
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.

173
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,641
It's okay. Come.

174
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,206
These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

175
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,218
How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

176
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,049
A few days.

177
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:02,956
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.

178
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,459
Chuma'll take you in
through the roof.

179
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,224
Following us, Father?

180
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:24,270
Is it safe to walk around?

181
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,331
Let's see.

182
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:49,026
Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.

183
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:52,090
Cast out after the war in heaven.

184
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:54,568
Can't even trust angels, can you?

185
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:09,849
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.

186
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,814
It's odd.

187
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:21,892
Churches were built to exalt heaven...

188
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:25,798
but this, the weapons
are pointing downward.

189
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,539
Look behind you, Father.

190
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,053
Desecration of Christ.

191
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:59,224
Who would do something like this?

192
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:04,937
The crucifix
was broken off from here.

193
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:07,475
Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

194
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,443
I wouldn't know.

195
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:12,106
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.

196
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:15,981
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

197
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:19,783
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.

198
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:22,653
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

199
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:24,955
He's gone mad.

200
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:34,595
No one's been inside Bession's tent
since he fell ill?

201
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,639
They are superstitious.

202
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:45,076
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.

203
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:48,239
- Chuma.
- Yes?

204
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,371
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.

205
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:59,811
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.

206
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:03,222
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?

207
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:05,886
The language spoken in Palestine
at the time of Christ.

208
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:09,260
And what does it say?

209
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:11,265
““The fallen shall rise...

210
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,063
in a river of blood.''

211
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:52,372
Do you have a moment?

212
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:55,308
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?

213
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:58,312
Or maybe something
more substantial?

214
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,610
Yes, that would be very nice.

215
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:04,417
You dabble in the occult?

216
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,552
I found them here when I arrived.

217
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:18,065
I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

218
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:22,894
You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

219
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,672
There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

220
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:33,214
He had no medical symptoms...

221
00:24:33,282 --> 00:24:37,946
nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

222
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,251
His breakdown was purely mental
and extremely severe.

223
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:44,156
That's why the Turkana fear
the church is cursed.

224
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:46,592
That and the disappearances.

225
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:49,495
In the past few weeks,
we've lost a dozen men.

226
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:51,999
Runaways?

227
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:54,035
Or is it those evil spirits?

228
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:56,094
Yeah.

229
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:10,875
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.

230
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:14,150
My father was a strong man.

231
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:16,851
When the Nazis started
rounding up theJews in our town...

232
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:19,952
he didn't hesitate.

233
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:22,156
He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

234
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,324
But someone turned us in...

235
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,335
and we were all sent to
the concentration camps.

236
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:29,132
I'm sorry.

237
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:32,936
People can't really
understand, can they?

238
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:35,636
If they weren't there...

239
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:38,077
if they didn't see.

240
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:40,138
No.

241
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,584
And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

242
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:50,819
I met him after the war,
and we came to Africa together, in love.

243
00:25:50,893 --> 00:25:54,886
One night I realized
I-- I had to tell him the truth...

244
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:57,455
about... the Nazis...

245
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,525
and what they did to me.

246
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:04,232
After that, he never touched me again.

247
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:07,605
So...

248
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:10,702
what turns a man of the cloth
into an archaeologist?

249
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:15,240
I don't know.
I suppose I--

250
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:19,651
I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

251
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:22,190
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.

252
00:26:22,258 --> 00:26:24,419
No.

253
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:27,860
There's no point in that.

254
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,127
Sometimes I think
the best view of God is from hell.

255
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:41,766
I should get to bed.

256
00:26:45,214 --> 00:26:48,615
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow
to see Bession.

257
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:53,216
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?

258
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:55,780
He runs the sanitarium.

259
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:58,656
Well, thank you...

260
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:01,491
for the medical care.

261
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:09,235
Deliver us from evil...

262
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:12,240
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

263
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,572
Amen.

264
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:52,698
You, priest.
What is your name?

265
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:55,175
I'm Father Merrin.

266
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,425
God is not here today, priest.

267
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:42,382
Want some water?

268
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:52,099
Hey, what's wrong?

269
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,500
It's late.

270
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:04,808
You should go back to bed.

271
00:30:13,722 --> 00:30:16,156
Give it to me! It's mine!

272
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:18,955
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!

273
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,996
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Here, take it.

274
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:23,861
- Take it!
- Oh,just give it to me, you idiot!

275
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:26,992
Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.

276
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:28,798
Give it to me!
It's mine.

277
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:31,601
- Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
- Just give it to me!

278
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:34,164
All right. Okay, okay.

279
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:37,644
Go back to bed,
and I'll give you the stupid thing.

280
00:30:49,024 --> 00:30:51,993
Joseph, look out!

281
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,290
Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!

282
00:30:54,363 --> 00:30:57,127
Joseph, help me!

283
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:04,462
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.

284
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,085
No! Help me!

285
00:31:46,982 --> 00:31:48,950
Help! Help me!

286
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:51,076
Help me!

287
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:03,927
Help me!
Help me! Please!

288
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:19,069
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They toreJames apart.

289
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:23,140
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.

290
00:32:23,218 --> 00:32:24,913
They were focused on his brother.

291
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:30,323
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.

292
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:52,636
Can you see?
Can you hear?

293
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:04,824
Come with me.

294
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:54,375
Monsieur Bession?

295
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,506
Mr. Bession.

296
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:01,742
You worked on a dig in Derati.

297
00:34:05,787 --> 00:34:09,621
You drew a picture of an idol.

298
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:12,524
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?

299
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,358
Mr. Bession.

300
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,230
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?

301
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:22,327
I said how do you know my name?

302
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:34,477
Are you hurt?

303
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:36,540
No.

304
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:45,583
I'm free.

305
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,227
God is not here today, priest.

306
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,471
I hope he finds peace.

307
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:41,982
I'm Father Gionetti.

308
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,610
I've been waiting for you.

309
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,416
How did he know my name?

310
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:50,515
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

311
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:54,225
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

312
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:57,094
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

313
00:35:57,165 --> 00:36:00,100
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

314
00:36:00,168 --> 00:36:04,104
So, "touched."
What does that mean?

315
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:08,302
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

316
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:11,174
was plagued by possession.

317
00:36:11,246 --> 00:36:13,840
Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

318
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:15,906
committing unspeakable acts.

319
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:19,681
Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

320
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:24,088
Simply horny... and inventive.

321
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,994
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

322
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:32,864
Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

323
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:36,392
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

324
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:38,962
with evil.

325
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,033
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

326
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:45,807
And that evil remains in Derati.

327
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:49,044
You must be careful there.

328
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:53,110
Remember, he is the father of lies.

329
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:56,646
He will seek to poison your mind.

330
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:59,717
You will need this against him.

331
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,627
The Roman Rituals.

332
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,431
If you need somebody to perform
an exorcism, I'm not your man.

333
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,495
I'm not a priest anymore.

334
00:37:11,573 --> 00:37:14,201
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.

335
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:17,504
Only your faith can save you.

336
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,740
Well, then I'm doomed.

337
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,730
Joseph?

338
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:43,354
What do you have there?

339
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:49,769
Can I see?

340
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:14,227
You threw it away.

341
00:39:14,295 --> 00:39:19,164
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.

342
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:22,203
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn't.

343
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,239
- The clasp must have come loose--
- Liar!

344
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,044
Do I repulse you that much?

345
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:34,172
Maybe if you could cure
my fucking face...

346
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:37,548
I might look as good to you
as that archaeologist.

347
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,726
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.

348
00:39:45,794 --> 00:39:48,319
What?

349
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:51,194
He's coming for you.

350
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:07,604
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.

351
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:09,547
Ohh.

352
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,585
Don't worry.

353
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:13,712
You'll be fine.

354
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,634
Where is everybody?

355
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:38,236
Sebituana's baby is coming,
so the village has gathered in welcome.

356
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,042
Oh.

357
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:11,207
Joseph. Hey.

358
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:23,514
Joseph.

359
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:35,199
You're back.

360
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,206
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.

361
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:43,301
These lesions--
they're not from the shock, are they?

362
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:46,279
No.
They're completely asymptomatic.

363
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:48,542
Itjust doesn't make sense.

364
00:41:48,616 --> 00:41:51,380
- He should have recovered by now.
- So what is it?

365
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:53,920
In this part of the world...

366
00:41:53,988 --> 00:41:56,548
it could be a dozen things...

367
00:41:56,624 --> 00:41:59,354
but his symptoms don't
really match any of them.

368
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:01,952
So all I can do
is just watch and wait.

369
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:08,591
I have to do some work up at the dig.

370
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,901
- Will you be all right?
- Hmm. Yes.

371
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:18,769
Come sit with me, Lancaster.

372
00:42:19,948 --> 00:42:22,348
I promise I won't bite.

373
00:42:30,692 --> 00:42:32,853
What is it?

374
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:36,260
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.

375
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:39,562
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.

376
00:42:42,637 --> 00:42:45,435
- How?
- I don't know.

377
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:48,498
Some accident.

378
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:08,896
I just don't understand everything
that's happening here.

379
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:11,761
It seems like I can't
help anyone anymore.

380
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,031
Hey.

381
00:43:18,273 --> 00:43:20,468
Easy.

382
00:44:46,961 --> 00:44:48,986
Help me hold him.

383
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:34,184
Emekwi. I'm doing
everything I can for him.

384
00:56:28,395 --> 00:56:30,386
Joseph?

385
00:58:38,692 --> 00:58:41,661
It's this place, Lancaster.
The Turkana are right.

386
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:44,492
- It's cursed.
- Sarah.

387
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:46,556
You don't understand.

388
00:58:48,902 --> 00:58:51,564
What they did to me
in the camp. They--

389
00:58:53,407 --> 00:58:55,398
There's nothing left to bleed.

390
00:58:57,144 --> 00:59:00,238
There is something here,
something evil.

391
00:59:00,314 --> 00:59:03,841
Sarah, it's so much easier
to believe in evil as an entity...

392
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,851
but it's not.

393
00:59:05,919 --> 00:59:09,650
It's a purely human condition
inside all of us.

394
00:59:11,225 --> 00:59:14,422
Did Bession talk about
what he found under the church?

395
00:59:16,363 --> 00:59:19,025
There's an ancient temple below,
a pagan place...

396
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:22,398
where they used to conduct sacrifices,
human sacrifices.

397
00:59:22,469 --> 00:59:25,836
Why would they build a church
on top of something like that?

398
00:59:25,906 --> 00:59:28,534
Perhaps to purify the site.

399
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:30,907
But then why bury it?

400
01:00:04,344 --> 01:00:06,642
No!

401
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:18,715
Merrin!

402
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:21,317
You better come with me.

403
01:00:21,395 --> 01:00:23,886
Jefferies didn't show up
for the dig this morning.

404
01:00:23,964 --> 01:00:28,094
He wasn't in his room,
so they came to the bar and they found--

405
01:01:14,614 --> 01:01:17,879
Chief Sebituana's baby
was stillborn last night.

406
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,885
He blames the whites.

407
01:01:19,953 --> 01:01:21,978
You think the Turkana tookJefferies?

408
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:25,149
I think this place
is on the verge of an uprising.

409
01:01:25,225 --> 01:01:27,125
I've contacted Major Granville.

410
01:01:27,194 --> 01:01:30,322
A detachment will be here
by this afternoon.

411
01:01:30,397 --> 01:01:32,524
You disagree?

412
01:01:34,301 --> 01:01:37,998
In my experience, bringing soldiers
into a situation is always a bad idea.

413
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:08,824
Who buried them?

414
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,101
Everybody died.

415
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:19,111
Who buried them?

416
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:43,894
All right! Halt!

417
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,904
- Major Granville.
- Hello, Peter.

418
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:48,805
Come on! Out you get!
Move it, Wilkins!

419
01:02:51,344 --> 01:02:54,006
- Any answers on Jefferies?
- I'm afraid not.

420
01:02:54,081 --> 01:02:57,539
Well, you did the right thing
calling me, Father.

421
01:02:57,617 --> 01:03:00,711
I've been in these situations before...

422
01:03:00,787 --> 01:03:03,221
and you have to stay on top of--

423
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:10,087
on top of these people.

424
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:14,122
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible
for what's happening here, Major.

425
01:03:17,471 --> 01:03:20,338
Major Granville?

426
01:03:21,908 --> 01:03:24,775
This dig is too important to jeopardize...

427
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:27,905
and until I'm satisfied
that the excavation is secure...

428
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:30,506
the British Army will
assume complete control.

429
01:03:30,584 --> 01:03:32,313
The Turkana won't like
the show of force.

430
01:03:32,385 --> 01:03:35,786
I'm not concerned with
what the Turkana like, Mr. Merrin!

431
01:03:35,856 --> 01:03:39,314
If they start any more trouble,
they will have to answer...

432
01:03:39,392 --> 01:03:42,987
to the might
of His Majesty King George.

433
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:50,803
You cannot be here.

434
01:03:50,871 --> 01:03:53,806
Please tell Sebituana
I'm sorry for his loss.

435
01:03:53,874 --> 01:03:57,105
You are not welcome here.

436
01:03:57,177 --> 01:04:01,204
I want to know about the plague
that destroyed this village 50 years ago.

437
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:03,306
It was not a plague.

438
01:04:05,852 --> 01:04:07,786
So, what was it?

439
01:04:07,854 --> 01:04:10,118
The evil in your church...

440
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:13,023
it has taken Emekwi's youngest son...

441
01:04:13,093 --> 01:04:15,118
and it is getting stronger.

442
01:04:15,195 --> 01:04:18,323
You must abandon your work...

443
01:04:18,398 --> 01:04:21,196
or we'll be forced to stop you.

444
01:04:21,268 --> 01:04:24,203
So you don't want to tell me?

445
01:04:31,244 --> 01:04:35,010
He says he doesn't have to tell you
because it's happening again...

446
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:37,311
right now.

447
01:05:04,744 --> 01:05:08,703
- You don't bury your dead. You cremate them.
- Yes.

448
01:05:08,782 --> 01:05:11,273
Then who's buried in that graveyard?

449
01:05:54,861 --> 01:05:56,795
I'm sorry.

450
01:06:23,423 --> 01:06:25,857
What are you--

451
01:07:05,565 --> 01:07:08,033
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.

452
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:49,226
I will shoot 10, priest,
and you will choose.

453
01:08:49,302 --> 01:08:51,896
I can't do that.

454
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:02,512
No! No!

455
01:09:02,582 --> 01:09:04,709
Now you choose...

456
01:09:04,784 --> 01:09:06,775
or I will kill them all.

457
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:13,024
Are you praying...

458
01:09:13,092 --> 01:09:14,582
to God?

459
01:09:15,662 --> 01:09:17,425
Shoot me.

460
01:09:25,438 --> 01:09:27,429
God is not here today, priest.

461
01:10:04,244 --> 01:10:07,543
Papa!

462
01:10:44,784 --> 01:10:46,718
- They're empty!
- What?

463
01:10:46,786 --> 01:10:49,277
I dug up three graves.
They were all empty. What happened here?

464
01:10:49,355 --> 01:10:51,880
- I-I don't know.
- Oh, yes, you do.

465
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:54,893
- You've been lying to me since we got here.
- Let go of me.

466
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:57,225
Damn it!
There are crosses on the graves!

467
01:10:57,297 --> 01:10:59,231
There are crosses on the coffins!

468
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:02,029
The church buried them, didn't they?

469
01:11:02,101 --> 01:11:03,966
Didn't they?

470
01:11:04,037 --> 01:11:06,028
Yes.

471
01:11:06,105 --> 01:11:08,039
Why?

472
01:11:08,107 --> 01:11:10,541
What were they hiding?

473
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,101
That this place is damned.

474
01:11:13,179 --> 01:11:16,444
No! You asked the question!
Now you're gonna listen to the answer!

475
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:20,351
There was a massacre here...

476
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:23,150
1,500 years ago.

477
01:11:23,222 --> 01:11:26,214
An army from the west,
led by two priests...

478
01:11:27,627 --> 01:11:30,118
searching for the origin
of a powerful evil.

479
01:11:30,196 --> 01:11:33,632
But when they got here
that evil consumed them...

480
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,965
turning the soldiers
against each other in a bloodbath.

481
01:11:37,036 --> 01:11:39,504
Only a single priest survived.

482
01:11:39,572 --> 01:11:42,507
When that priest made it back
to the EmperorJustinian...

483
01:11:42,575 --> 01:11:46,011
he ordered that a church
be built over the site and then buried...

484
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:48,013
to seal the evil inside.

485
01:11:48,081 --> 01:11:51,278
All mention of it was to be stricken
from the history texts forever.

486
01:11:51,351 --> 01:11:53,285
But it wasn't?

487
01:11:53,353 --> 01:11:56,049
No.

488
01:11:56,122 --> 01:11:58,386
In 1893...

489
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:02,485
a Vatican researcher
found an ancient letter in the archives.

490
01:12:02,562 --> 01:12:05,087
Four priests came
to examine the site...

491
01:12:05,164 --> 01:12:08,600
enlisting the help of the people
of this valley in their search...

492
01:12:08,668 --> 01:12:11,364
and they all disappeared.

493
01:12:11,437 --> 01:12:13,701
Where did they go?

494
01:12:13,773 --> 01:12:15,764
No one knows.

495
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:20,008
The Vatican ordered a cover-up--

496
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:22,513
the false graveyard...

497
01:12:22,582 --> 01:12:25,642
the tale of a plague to--

498
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,619
to scare people away.

499
01:12:28,688 --> 01:12:30,952
And then the British
stumbled across it.

500
01:12:31,024 --> 01:12:34,687
And I was sent here
to see if the legend was real.

501
01:12:34,761 --> 01:12:37,229
What legend?

502
01:12:37,296 --> 01:12:40,129
That after the war in heaven...

503
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:42,690
this is the spot where Lucifer fell.

504
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,715
God brought you here, Lancaster.

505
01:12:56,783 --> 01:12:58,910
Leave me alone.

506
01:12:58,985 --> 01:13:00,919
No.

507
01:13:00,987 --> 01:13:02,921
No.

508
01:13:02,989 --> 01:13:04,854
The devil is here...

509
01:13:04,924 --> 01:13:06,858
inside that boy.

510
01:13:06,926 --> 01:13:08,860
The Turkana know it.

511
01:13:08,928 --> 01:13:12,864
They came to drive the devil from him,
and he almost killed them.

512
01:13:12,932 --> 01:13:15,196
You can't run from this.

513
01:13:15,268 --> 01:13:17,600
You must help me.

514
01:13:18,805 --> 01:13:21,239
I can't.

515
01:13:21,307 --> 01:13:24,242
But you've seen what's going on here.

516
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,801
You have to believe.

517
01:13:30,316 --> 01:13:32,250
I believe in nothing.

518
01:13:36,589 --> 01:13:38,284
Found Jefferies.

519
01:13:57,276 --> 01:13:58,971
- Over there!
- As you were!

520
01:13:59,045 --> 01:14:02,071
Major Granville!
Wait!

521
01:14:36,315 --> 01:14:38,306
Get him down.

522
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,311
Get him down!

523
01:14:51,164 --> 01:14:53,155
You all right, Major?

524
01:14:54,934 --> 01:14:57,368
Savages.

525
01:15:06,078 --> 01:15:09,377
Major! Major!

526
01:15:19,025 --> 01:15:21,994
- Bloody savages.
- Why are you here?

527
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:24,928
- Granville!
- You have no business to be here!

528
01:15:25,932 --> 01:15:27,866
- You must leave.
- Granville!

529
01:15:27,934 --> 01:15:30,300
- You people have plundered our ancestors.
- Granville!

530
01:15:30,369 --> 01:15:32,803
You must return Turkana to us now.

531
01:15:32,872 --> 01:15:34,965
- Let me through!
- It is time to go.

532
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:36,975
You have already polluted our lives.

533
01:15:37,043 --> 01:15:41,343
You came here with your evil.
We knew peace before you came.

534
01:15:41,414 --> 01:15:43,143
Granville!

535
01:15:44,784 --> 01:15:48,220
No!

536
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:52,053
No! No!

537
01:15:54,327 --> 01:15:57,023
No!

538
01:15:57,096 --> 01:16:00,759
They think it's insideJoseph!
They believe the evil is upon us!

539
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:02,698
Chuma!

540
01:16:02,768 --> 01:16:04,497
Merrin.

541
01:16:06,105 --> 01:16:08,903
They believe it is inside Joseph.

542
01:16:08,975 --> 01:16:10,943
They are going to kill him.

543
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:13,672
Now, please... go!

544
01:16:17,516 --> 01:16:19,848
You animals!

545
01:16:47,146 --> 01:16:50,047
- Turn this way!
- I don't like it. Come on!

546
01:16:52,885 --> 01:16:56,286
Three boxes of ammunition!

547
01:16:58,257 --> 01:17:01,283
Sir. The Turkana
are preparing to attack.

548
01:17:03,296 --> 01:17:05,127
Leave me.

549
01:17:06,666 --> 01:17:08,657
Sir?

550
01:17:10,636 --> 01:17:12,627
I said, leave me.

551
01:17:14,307 --> 01:17:16,298
Yes, sir.

552
01:18:58,144 --> 01:19:00,078
We must leave now.

553
01:19:00,146 --> 01:19:02,080
Why?

554
01:19:02,148 --> 01:19:04,582
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.

555
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,914
Take the boy to Nairobi.

556
01:19:06,986 --> 01:19:09,113
Father Gionetti.

557
01:19:09,188 --> 01:19:11,349
Why?

558
01:19:11,424 --> 01:19:13,415
Turkana are coming to kill him.

559
01:19:23,502 --> 01:19:25,561
It's a sandstorm.

560
01:19:31,544 --> 01:19:33,569
It won't let us leave.

561
01:19:37,016 --> 01:19:40,076
We have to hide him.

562
01:19:40,152 --> 01:19:42,143
- The church.
- No!

563
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:44,155
The Turkana won't go in there.

564
01:19:44,223 --> 01:19:46,191
It's his only chance.

565
01:19:48,194 --> 01:19:50,822
- Aren't you coming?
- I have to find Sarah.

566
01:19:50,896 --> 01:19:52,591
We'll meet you.

567
01:19:52,665 --> 01:19:54,633
Francis!

568
01:20:01,006 --> 01:20:02,735
Now go.

569
01:20:13,853 --> 01:20:15,684
Sarah?

570
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:59,524
The Lord is coming for you.

571
01:22:30,289 --> 01:22:31,813
Sarah?

572
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:33,482
Sarah!

573
01:22:36,495 --> 01:22:41,990
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sanctu.

574
01:22:48,407 --> 01:22:51,171
- Steady now!
- Pick it up, mate!

575
01:23:12,331 --> 01:23:14,162
Sarah?

576
01:23:29,348 --> 01:23:30,975
Sarah!

577
01:24:31,977 --> 01:24:33,968
Oh, my God.

578
01:24:35,581 --> 01:24:37,572
Bession was Sarah's husband?

579
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:39,241
Yes.

580
01:24:39,318 --> 01:24:43,084
She went into the church
with him, didn't she?

581
01:24:48,794 --> 01:24:51,957
It's notJoseph.
It's Sarah.

582
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,964
Sancti Michael Archangel--

583
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,774
Ready yourselves, men!

584
01:25:46,051 --> 01:25:48,042
Fire!

585
01:26:04,102 --> 01:26:06,093
Chuma!

586
01:28:12,864 --> 01:28:15,162
Francis?

587
01:28:15,233 --> 01:28:17,258
Francis.

588
01:28:36,188 --> 01:28:38,986
Francis.

589
01:29:06,218 --> 01:29:09,710
O Lord, forgive my disbelief.

590
01:29:09,788 --> 01:29:11,722
I need you.

591
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:15,351
These people need you.
This valley needs you.

592
01:29:15,427 --> 01:29:18,055
Hear my cry.

593
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:20,291
Do not abandon me now.

594
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,925
Forgive my sins.

595
01:29:53,799 --> 01:29:56,359
Joseph.

596
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:04,174
Come sit with us, Lancaster.

597
01:30:05,343 --> 01:30:07,538
I promise I won't bite!

598
01:30:07,612 --> 01:30:10,410
Joseph, run.

599
01:30:13,752 --> 01:30:15,777
- He's mine.
- Run!

600
01:30:23,295 --> 01:30:26,321
Leave him alone.
It's me you want.

601
01:30:32,938 --> 01:30:34,803
I am a fallen priest.

602
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:43,213
Lord, have mercy on us.

603
01:30:43,281 --> 01:30:45,772
Christ, have mercy on us.

604
01:30:45,851 --> 01:30:48,251
Lord, have mercy on us.

605
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,754
God, Father in heaven,
have mercy on us.

606
01:30:52,324 --> 01:30:55,418
God, the Son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us.

607
01:30:55,494 --> 01:30:58,793
God, the Holy Spirit,
have mercy on us.

608
01:30:58,864 --> 01:31:01,731
Christ, hear us.

609
01:31:03,468 --> 01:31:06,096
Holy Mary, pray for us.

610
01:31:06,171 --> 01:31:08,162
Christ, hear us.

611
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:12,541
- Lord, have mercy on us.
- What's the matter, Merrin?

612
01:31:12,611 --> 01:31:14,602
Don't you want to
fuck me anymore?

613
01:31:18,984 --> 01:31:22,112
All ye holy angels and archangels...

614
01:31:22,187 --> 01:31:24,018
pray for us!

615
01:31:24,089 --> 01:31:27,525
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits,
pray for us!

616
01:31:27,592 --> 01:31:31,551
Why would he listen to you?

617
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:33,461
You.

618
01:31:33,532 --> 01:31:36,695
You believe in nothing.
You're all alone.

619
01:31:36,768 --> 01:31:38,668
Without hope.

620
01:31:44,442 --> 01:31:47,104
Almighty Lord...

621
01:31:47,179 --> 01:31:49,170
and father ofJesus Christ...

622
01:31:49,247 --> 01:31:52,216
grant me, your unworthy servant,
pardon for all my sins...

623
01:31:52,284 --> 01:31:54,809
and the power to fight this cruel--

624
01:32:11,102 --> 01:32:14,560
Joseph, come on.
Don't be afraid.

625
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,164
No! Father!

626
01:32:18,109 --> 01:32:20,043
Joseph!

627
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:23,512
Father, help me!

628
01:32:23,582 --> 01:32:26,346
- Help me! Help me!
- Joseph!

629
01:32:26,418 --> 01:32:29,615
Father Merrin!

630
01:32:29,688 --> 01:32:32,452
Merrin!

631
01:32:48,406 --> 01:32:52,399
O Lord, by your name save me.

632
01:32:53,511 --> 01:32:55,411
By your strength
defend my cause.

633
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:27,940
No!

634
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:03,845
- Father!
- Joseph?

635
01:34:14,559 --> 01:34:17,357
Joseph!Joseph!

636
01:34:17,429 --> 01:34:19,420
Wait!

637
01:34:21,066 --> 01:34:23,034
Joseph.

638
01:34:23,101 --> 01:34:24,932
Father!

639
01:34:25,003 --> 01:34:26,994
I'm coming.

640
01:34:51,463 --> 01:34:54,557
O God, hear my prayer.

641
01:34:54,632 --> 01:34:56,862
The ruthless seek my life.

642
01:34:56,935 --> 01:35:00,234
They do not keep God before them.

643
01:35:00,305 --> 01:35:02,671
Turn back the evil upon my foes.

644
01:35:04,442 --> 01:35:07,411
In your faithfulness destroy them.

645
01:35:35,006 --> 01:35:36,667
Where's your God now, Merrin?

646
01:35:36,741 --> 01:35:39,403
Fucking his only son
while you call out his name?

647
01:35:39,477 --> 01:35:42,378
He doesn't care about this whore.

648
01:35:42,447 --> 01:35:44,142
But you do...

649
01:35:44,215 --> 01:35:47,343
because you want to
shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass.

650
01:35:56,594 --> 01:35:58,892
You can't have her, priest.
The whore is mine.

651
01:35:58,963 --> 01:36:02,057
And I'll kill her before
I let you take her from me.

652
01:36:04,469 --> 01:36:09,031
From the souls made to
the image and likeness of God...

653
01:36:09,107 --> 01:36:10,938
I cast you out!

654
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:14,701
You're a killer, Merrin.

655
01:36:14,779 --> 01:36:17,873
You looked them in the eye,
pointed your finger, and they died.

656
01:36:17,949 --> 01:36:21,817
God is not here today, priest.

657
01:36:24,622 --> 01:36:26,419
Oh, yes, he is.

658
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:46,240
You're going to watch him die, Merrin.

659
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:49,144
Fail him like you failed all the others.

660
01:36:49,214 --> 01:36:52,775
God, spare this child,
for he is innocent...

661
01:36:52,851 --> 01:36:54,751
and deserves your blessing.

662
01:36:54,819 --> 01:36:58,016
God, spare this child...

663
01:36:58,089 --> 01:36:59,852
for he is innocent...

664
01:36:59,924 --> 01:37:02,188
and deserves your blessing.

665
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:06,162
God, spare this child, for he is innocent
and deserves your blessing.

666
01:37:11,903 --> 01:37:15,430
I command you to depart!
It's the power of Christ that compels you!

667
01:37:15,507 --> 01:37:18,169
It is God himself who commands you.

668
01:37:18,243 --> 01:37:20,507
It's the majestic Christ who commands you!

669
01:37:20,578 --> 01:37:22,876
God, the Father, commands you.
God, the Son, commands you.

670
01:37:22,947 --> 01:37:24,710
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

671
01:37:24,782 --> 01:37:26,545
The mystery of the cross commands you!

672
01:37:26,618 --> 01:37:29,143
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!

673
01:37:42,467 --> 01:37:44,958
- Lancaster.
- Sarah.

674
01:37:45,036 --> 01:37:47,300
Sarah.

675
01:37:47,372 --> 01:37:49,738
It's over now.

676
01:37:59,751 --> 01:38:01,810
Joseph.

677
01:38:01,886 --> 01:38:04,684
Joseph.

678
01:38:18,169 --> 01:38:20,763
Merrin!

679
01:38:20,838 --> 01:38:23,500
Father!

680
01:38:31,182 --> 01:38:33,616
Don't be afraid.

681
01:38:33,685 --> 01:38:35,619
I need your help,Joseph.

682
01:38:40,992 --> 01:38:45,588
Listen, whatever you hear,
whatever you see, it's just his lies.

683
01:38:45,663 --> 01:38:49,531
Don't listen. Don't watch.
You understand?

684
01:38:49,601 --> 01:38:52,069
Don't listen!

685
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:56,197
It's just lies.
You have to be strong and concentrate.

686
01:38:56,274 --> 01:38:59,266
Can you read this?

687
01:38:59,344 --> 01:39:02,745
I will start there.
Then you will answer.

688
01:39:02,814 --> 01:39:04,941
That's me. That's you.
That's me, and that's you.

689
01:39:05,016 --> 01:39:06,881
You understand?

690
01:39:06,951 --> 01:39:08,748
Good.

691
01:39:10,955 --> 01:39:13,583
Let's start.

692
01:39:15,126 --> 01:39:17,060
O God...

693
01:39:17,128 --> 01:39:19,926
by your name save me.

694
01:39:19,998 --> 01:39:21,625
““Amen.''

695
01:39:21,699 --> 01:39:23,599
Save your servant.

696
01:39:23,668 --> 01:39:27,661
““Who places his trust in thee, my God.''

697
01:39:27,739 --> 01:39:30,674
Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.

698
01:39:30,742 --> 01:39:32,471
““In the face of the enemy.''

699
01:39:32,543 --> 01:39:35,273
O Lord, hear my prayer.

700
01:39:35,346 --> 01:39:38,110
““And let my cry come unto thee.''

701
01:39:38,182 --> 01:39:41,674
- The Lord be with you.
- ““And also with you.''

702
01:39:48,893 --> 01:39:51,191
Begone, evil spirit...

703
01:39:51,262 --> 01:39:55,824
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

704
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:58,334
and of the Holy Ghost!

705
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:03,973
By the sign of this holy cross...

706
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:07,537
by our Lord Jesus Christ...

707
01:40:09,447 --> 01:40:11,938
God, the Holy Ghost, commands you!

708
01:40:15,586 --> 01:40:18,180
The blood of the martyrs commands you!

709
01:40:22,093 --> 01:40:24,459
In God's name, demon...

710
01:40:25,697 --> 01:40:29,064
I cast you out!

711
01:40:44,649 --> 01:40:47,140
Sarah?

712
01:41:09,874 --> 01:41:11,865
Sarah.

713
01:41:26,657 --> 01:41:28,648
Okay?

714
01:41:47,612 --> 01:41:49,307
Thank you.

715
01:42:06,097 --> 01:42:08,031
Look, um--

716
01:42:08,099 --> 01:42:10,465
Sarah, what is it?

717
01:42:10,535 --> 01:42:12,969
What is it, Sarah?

718
01:42:13,037 --> 01:42:15,028
What is it, Sarah?

719
01:42:16,507 --> 01:42:19,499
Lancaster!

720
01:42:19,577 --> 01:42:21,841
- No!
- Help--

721
01:42:21,913 --> 01:42:23,744
Sarah.

722
01:42:23,815 --> 01:42:26,010
- No!
- Help--

723
01:42:27,652 --> 01:42:29,643
Sarah.

724
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:37,178
Father?

725
01:43:42,693 --> 01:43:44,718
She's with God now.

726
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:49,865
She's with God.

727
01:45:22,226 --> 01:45:24,990
I trust your mission was successful.

728
01:45:30,901 --> 01:45:34,462
I couldn't find
what you were looking for.

729
01:45:34,538 --> 01:45:37,132
But you found something.

730
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:39,608
Didn't you?

731
01:45:46,117 --> 01:45:48,051
Good-bye, Mr. Semelier.

732
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:50,314
Au revoir, Mr. Merrin.

733
01:45:50,388 --> 01:45:52,686
It's Father Merrin.
