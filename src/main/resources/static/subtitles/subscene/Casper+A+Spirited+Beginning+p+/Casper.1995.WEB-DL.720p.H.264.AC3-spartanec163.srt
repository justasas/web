1
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,350
Okay. One picture
and we're history.

2
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,790
That's what I'm afraid of.

3
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,980
Come on.

4
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,750
<i>Oh, man, do we</i>
<i>have to do this?</i>

5
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,680
You want everyone
at school to think
we're chicken?

6
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,680
I could live with that.
You wuss. Come on.

7
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,930
Oh, whoa!
Oh, man!

8
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,160
L-I don't see anything.
Do you?

9
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,760
No, I don't
see anything.

10
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,100
Let's just take the picture
and get outta here.

11
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,300
Fine, fine. Here,
take the picture.

12
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,050
Now, wait a minute. I gotta
be in the picture too, or no one
will believe I was here.

13
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,590
Just shut up
and take the picture.
No, you take the picture.

14
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,620
You take it.
You!

15
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,350
<i>Guys, guys, don't fight.</i>
<i>I'll take the picture.</i>

16
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,360
<i>Say cheese.!</i>

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,920
<i>A ghost.!</i>

18
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,090
<i>And to the Save The Dolphins</i>
<i>Foundation: $ 11 million.</i>

19
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,500
To the Save The Pumas
Foundation: $1.2 million.

20
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,170
To the Patagonian Wasp
Salvation Fund: $1.4 million.

21
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,470
<i>To the Dyslexic</i>
<i>Dalmatians Foundation:4</i>...

22
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,570
To hell with the livestock.
What'd the old stiff
leave me?

23
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,020
Um, I believe that
what the bereaved...

24
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,020
is trying to express
is that the sudden death...

25
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,150
of her <i>only</i> father has
left a great gaping void...

26
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,420
in her bank...
in her life.

27
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,520
Carrigan wonders what he has
left her to fill it up with.

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,230
Hmm. Let's see.

29
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,970
Bobcats, owls,

30
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,570
<i>snakes.</i>

31
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,370
<i>Daughter: Carrigan.</i>

32
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,640
Whipstaff Manor in Maine.

33
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,050
And?

34
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,520
And I'm late for lunch,
so if you'll excuse me.

35
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,220
Are you trying to tell me
that I just spent
the last two days...

36
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,130
holding his clammy hand,
waiting for him to kick,

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,860
and all I get in return
is one lousy piece of property?

38
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,390
No, it was <i>lousy</i> 50 years ago.
Now it's condemned.

39
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,400
Enjoy.

40
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,740
Wait a minute!
This is not fair!

41
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,300
<i>I'll contest it, then I'm gonna</i>
<i>drag you and every one of</i>
<i>those damn dolphins into court.!</i>

42
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,640
Knock yourself out.

43
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,910
Dibs! This is all
your fault, as usual.

44
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,650
If you would have just
forged the damn will.

45
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,660
Carrigan, this is
condemned <i>seafront</i> property.

46
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,660
Oh, Dibs!
Don't you get it?

47
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,750
Flipper got more money
than me.

48
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,990
Carrigan,
the deed's in there!

49
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,060
Oh! Ouch!

50
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,040
Ow. Ouch!

51
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,080
"Buccaneers
and buried gold.

52
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,950
Whipstaff doth
a treasure hold."

53
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,390
Treasure?
Dibs, you idiot!
Get it out!

54
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,000
I knew that place was
worth something. There's
treasure in that house.

55
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,300
And finally, I'm gonna
get what I deserve.

56
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,810
Carrigan,
I think I need a doctor.
Oh, there's plenty in Maine.

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,590
So... what do you think?

58
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,070
I think you're
gonna get wet.

59
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,310
Hey! Wait!
Carrigan!

60
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,850
Carrigan!

61
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,460
Dibs, light, light!

62
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,820
What a dump.

63
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,700
<i>Wow. Wow.!</i>

64
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,710
This place is fabulous.
You could just do
so much with it.

65
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,650
I mean, it's
a bit spooky.
Dibs.

66
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,280
Aaah! Aaah!

67
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,980
<i>Hello.</i>
Huh?

68
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,390
Who is it?
Who is it?

69
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,790
<i>Afraid I can't</i>
<i>answer that.</i>

70
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,830
Why not?
Why not?

71
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,330
<i>It's kind of hard</i>
<i>to explain. Uh</i>...

72
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,260
Is he the caretaker?
Are you the caretaker?

73
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,030
<i>No.!</i>
Is he a transient?

74
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,800
Is he...
Are you a transient?
<i>No, not exactly.</i>

75
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,310
Tell him
to show himself.
Show yourself!

76
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,070
<i>Here's the thing.</i>
<i>If I do, don't scream, okay?</i>

77
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,210
<i>I get that a lot.</i>

78
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,720
Are you a burglar?
I must warn you
that I am armed.

79
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,350
Hello?

80
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,390
Listen!
Cut the crap, okay?

81
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,330
If you don't show yourself,
I'm gonna have you arrested
for trespassing!

82
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,370
<i>Okay, okay.</i>
<i>Geez, calm down, lady.</i>
<i>Here I come.!</i>

83
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,770
Hi! I'm Casper!

84
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,040
You shouldn't do that
or you'll wake up...

85
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,570
Too late.

86
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,580
So tell me,
you have experience?

87
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,450
I have-a quite a bit
of experience.

88
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,110
Not, you know,
like, exactly doin' it.

89
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,060
But I've studied it,
and I've talked to people
who have done it.

90
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,760
I've-a seen videos,
and I feel very confident
with-a my knowledge...

91
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,770
I could do it,
no problem.

92
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,070
Then you can
handle this?
It's-a no problem.

93
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,940
It's-a like no problem
whatsoever. Piece of cake.
Piece of <i>crumb</i> cake.

94
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,140
Well?
How did it go?

95
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,680
Oh, it was-a fine.
Was, uh, no problem.
Piece of cake.

96
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,490
Who you gonna call?

97
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,860
Someone else.

98
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,960
What do we do now?

99
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,470
What do I usually do
when something stands
in my way?

100
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,580
<i>Check those fuses.!</i>

101
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,890
Um, are you sure
we're not going
a tad overboard here?

102
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Dibs, I have huffed and puffed.
Now I want to rip
this place down.

103
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,130
I want my treasure.
They can't haunt a pile
of rubble, for Christ's sake.

104
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,430
<i>People, people, please.!</i>

105
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,000
You're sweaty
male construction types,
for Christ's sake!

106
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,700
Dibs, do something.

107
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,920
Charlie, quick, keep runnin'!
Don't look back!
Run, Charlie, run!

108
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,620
<i>Wait, wait. They were</i>
<i>just kidding. Honest.!</i>

109
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,060
Oh, every time.
All I want's a friend.

110
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,670
Did you ever feel the way
Priscilla Cow felt?

111
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,500
That you'd like to be
completely different?

112
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,370
Almost everybody feels
like that once in a while.

113
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,510
But most of the time,
I hope you can be glad
to be yourself.

114
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,040
That's really
something to celebrate.

115
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,980
A g-g-ghost!

116
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,630
More on the Pentagon playboys
as the story unfolds, but now:

117
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,430
Step aside, Sigmund Freud.
Jump back, Joyce Brothers.

118
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,340
It's Dr. James Harvey,
therapist to the dead?

119
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,770
Are you depressed, anxious?

120
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,500
Are you lonely?
Do you need someone to talk to?

121
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,740
No problem,
if you're a ghost.

122
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,270
You can call them ghosts,
if you like, or as I prefer,

123
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,290
the living impaired.

124
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,260
But the bottom line is,
they need help sometimes.

125
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,420
Just like the rest of us.

126
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,990
After the sudden, unexpected
death of his wife Amelia,

127
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,330
Dr. Harvey gave up
conventional psychiatry and,
some say, conventional sanity.

128
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,800
Now, along with his
loner daughter, Kat...
short for Kathy...

129
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,280
Doc Harvey travels from
town to town, searching
for paranoid poltergeists,

130
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,840
scared specters,
the depressed and the dead.

131
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,680
How do you feel about what
your father does for a living?

132
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,720
Could you please
not ask me any questions?

133
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,920
Do you believe
in ghosts? Ever seen one?
Does your father ever hurt you?

134
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,260
He's my father.
Could you just talk to us?

135
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,060
Look, it's the first day of school.

136
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,830
I'm sure I'm gonna have homework,
so would you please?

137
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,500
Carrigan.

138
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,850
<i>What part don't</i>
<i>you understand?</i>

139
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,550
But who is this man...

140
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,030
No, not "I ate fish."
I hate fish.
Don't you have cows here?

141
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,030
Listen, I have had
a long and trying day.

142
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,370
Do you think you could bring me
a pint of Haagen-Dazs ice cream,
rum raisin, and a Diet Pepsi?

143
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,370
Think you can handle that?

144
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,280
Now you want me to hold.
Fine.

145
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,280
With therapy, they can
begin to process this pain.

146
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,380
They can pack up
their emotional baggage,
and they can move on.

147
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,680
My Harry passed away
five years ago,

148
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,690
but he was so miserable,
his spirit wouldn't leave
the apartment.

149
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,200
So I called Dr. Harvey.
He came over.

150
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,720
And in a few weeks,
Harry left, smiling.

151
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,260
<i>The living impaired</i>
<i>are known for haunting us.</i>

152
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,430
<i>My question is,</i>
<i>what's haunting them?</i>

153
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,410
It's a lack of resolution.

154
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,880
Ghosts are simply spirits
without resolution,
with unfinished business.

155
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,250
It's my job to find out
what that is.

156
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,980
<i>And so Dr. Harvey continues</i>
<i>his work, dragging his daughter</i>
<i>along for the ride.</i>

157
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,320
This week they're in Santa Fe.
But next week? Boo knows?

158
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,690
<i>Now, from the ghost shrink</i>
<i>to shrinking thighs.</i>
Yes, I'm still here.

159
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,960
<i>The miracle fat cream</i>
<i>experiment, next.</i>
Get me Santa Fe.

160
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,450
<i># That's life #</i>

161
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,980
# That's life #
<i># That's life #</i>

162
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,080
# That's what
all the people say #

163
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,350
# You're ridin' high in April
shot down in... #

164
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,560
Oh, honey, I'm sorry
about your Cactus Spooners.
Crooners.

165
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't care what they said.
You are not demented.

166
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,370
You're a picture
of mental health.
They were talking about <i>you.</i>

167
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,140
Try explaining
afterlife therapy to
a bunch of junior high kids.

168
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,540
Some people go through life
never questioning the norm.

169
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,050
But you and I, we're doing
something extraordinary
with our lives.

170
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,710
No, <i>we</i> aren't doing anything.

171
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,280
You're the one who's been
packing up my stuff and
moving me around the country.

172
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,620
In two years, I have been
to nine different schools.

173
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,630
I have eaten in nine
different cafeterias.

174
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,220
I can't even
remember anyone's name.

175
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,760
For once, I would
just like to be...

176
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,770
in one place long enough
to make a friend.

177
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,170
Honey, you will.

178
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,300
I mean, come on.
We're movin' to
Friendship, Maine.

179
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,640
Even I might make one.
You better, Dad.

180
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,380
'Cause a single guy your age
is more likely to become
a bank hostage...

181
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,420
than to make new friends.

182
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,510
You sound like your mother.

183
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,490
You're not gonna find her.

184
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,690
Mom's not a ghost, Dad.

185
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,540
Oh, yes, she is.
She has unfinished business.

186
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,670
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

187
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,040
I'll tell you what.
You go with me
this one last time.

188
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,060
If I don't find what
I'm looking for, it's over.

189
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,060
No more moving,
no more ghost mining.

190
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,260
You promise?

191
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,120
I promise.

192
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,100
Deal.

193
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,570
Deal.

194
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,560
Wow! It's not
so bad, huh?

195
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,120
If you're Stephen King.

196
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,230
Dr. Harvey, hello.
I'm Carrigan Crittenden.

197
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,280
And this is Dibs.
Hello.

198
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,040
I'm a close,
personal friend.

199
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,680
Ah.
And this is my daughter, Kat.

200
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,280
His close,
personal daughter.

201
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,350
How nice to meet you,
Kat.
Very nice to meet you.

202
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,400
You have
a beautiful daughter.
Very beautiful.

203
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,760
I can't tell you
how happy we are
you could come to Whipstaff.

204
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,460
Very happy.
The both of us.

205
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,510
You're kind of
hurting my face.

206
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,600
Sorry. Now, Dr. Harvey,

207
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,940
<i>exactly what time frame</i>
<i>are you looking at?</i>

208
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,110
Tell me you go
in the house and spray
and that's it.

209
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,710
Pssssst!
No, no, no.

210
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,980
As with a traditional
psychological cure, it can
take weeks or years for...

211
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,790
Excuse me. You didn't
just say the word "years,"
did you?

212
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,020
It's conceivable.
No, it isn't.

213
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,230
- Days is conceivable.
Weeks, maybe.
- Possibly.

214
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,100
- Months? No.
Years? Forget it!
- Forget it.

215
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,640
Dibs, check.

216
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,010
Get the bouquet.
Now, Dr. Harvey.

217
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,910
I will be watching you
very closely.

218
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,780
These are for you!
Have a lovely night.

219
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,680
Wow.

220
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,460
It's her. She's here.
She's in my house. I did it!

221
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,830
What if she likes me?
What if she doesn't?

222
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,630
Hi, I'm Casper.
I'm a ghost?

223
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,260
No, that's total disaster. Oh!

224
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,370
Yo, I'm Casper.
So, give me four.

225
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,110
Oh, God,
I'd kill for a pinky.

226
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,310
Huh? See?
That was easy.

227
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,730
Yeah. These should hold for now,
but we ought to get a box
of 20 amps in the morning.

228
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,790
Oh, uh,
right, yeah.

229
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,490
Uh, twenties
should be fine.

230
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,440
All right, I'm gonna
go find a room, Dad.

231
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,500
You gonna be
all right alone?

232
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,480
Hey, if I'm not
back in ten days,
send a search party.

233
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,680
<i>"Stretch,"</i>

234
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,250
<i>"Fatso"...</i>

235
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,260
<i>and "Stinkie"?</i>

236
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,090
Man, they had cruel parents.

237
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,160
Wonder where
Doc and Dopey sleep.

238
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,760
Dad! I found my room.

239
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,970
There's a girl...
on my bed. Yes!

240
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,540
Hey, space master.

241
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,140
In here.
Oh.

242
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,780
<i>It's very scary.</i>

243
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,450
Have you seen
any surprises yet?

244
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,820
Please. This is
the deadest place yet.

245
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,980
Oh, this is
a nice room.

246
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, right. This place
is a freak's holiday.

247
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,550
Hi... Ooh! Ooh!

248
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,510
Oh.
<i>Oh.</i>

249
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,370
Mom belongs over here.

250
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,880
Hey, how about
if I help you unpack?

251
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,120
Why bother?
We'll just be repacking
in two weeks anyway, right?

252
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,630
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
This place is... fine.

253
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,530
Good. Night, Bucket.

254
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,630
Night, Dad.

255
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,370
We're gonna be glad we came.
You watch.

256
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,960
Wh... Whoa!

257
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,270
Ooh, ooh!

258
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,030
Uh...

259
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,330
I... No.

260
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,440
I...

261
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,350
Uh...
Uh... Hi?

262
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,990
Oh, man!

263
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:11,200
Perfect first impression.
What a jerk.

264
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,680
Better?

265
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,620
<i>Honey?</i>

266
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,880
Hon... Honey?
Honey, what?

267
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,260
Dad, Dad,
I saw a ghost!

268
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,990
It was a real ghost.
It was a real, live ghost.
Slow down. What?

269
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,160
I saw a ghost.
It had a head, and it was round,
and it was white and see-through.

270
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,030
Honey, wait.
Now maybe...
Dad, please.

271
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,700
Do not think I'm as crazy
as I thought you were.
I promise.

272
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,230
No, no, no.
But remember, ghosts
can't hurt you, okay?

273
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,470
They're simply spirits
with unfinished business.

274
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,740
Let's just see
about this ghost.

275
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,750
Come here. Come on.

276
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,780
Check here. Oop, see?
No ghost there.

277
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,950
Now we can check over here.

278
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,650
Nope.

279
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,060
Oh! No, there's
no ghost in there.

280
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,190
We can even check over here.

281
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,270
There. See?

282
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,380
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

283
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,580
Dad!
Put me down!

284
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,620
This is insane.
What are you doing?

285
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,620
I can walk, you know?

286
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,390
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>this is big.</i>

287
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,660
<i>Um, Dad?</i>
<i>What?</i>

288
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,260
<i>We're in a closet.</i>

289
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,570
Right. Now, I want you
to stay in here...

290
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,800
no matter what
you hear, okay?

291
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,870
Okay.
Okay.

292
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,910
Wait.
What?

293
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,240
Dad, I'm sorry.
For what?

294
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,410
For not believing you.
For thinking you were
a total loser.

295
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,080
Aw, honey...
Apologize later.

296
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,350
Blew it, blew it,
blew it, blew it...

297
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,090
<i>Yee-haw.!</i>
Uh-oh, it's them.

298
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,690
Here they come!

299
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,000
Yee-haw!

300
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,970
Man, oh, man,
them ponies run faster
when we go down to Belmont.

301
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,980
Here, Flicka.
Bleaaugh!

302
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,510
Hey, guys.
Have fun?

303
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,850
Oh, look, it's Casper.
Casper.

304
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,720
You know on a scale
of one to ten...
ten being fun,

305
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:46,380
and one being you...
yeah, we had fun.

306
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,590
Giddyup there.

307
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,930
Say, bulbhead, why ain't you
inside doin' your chores?

308
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,630
Yeah, where's dinner?
I'm starvin'.
I'm wastin' away.

309
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,370
I know. How about you guys
relax out here, and tonight
we'll eat al fresco?

310
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,530
Hey, sounds great.
Who's that?

311
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,340
Short sheet, you wouldn't
be trying to keep us
outta the house, would ya?

312
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:10,970
No! No!
I can see right through
that bulbous head of yours.

313
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,110
It's just such
a lovely night.

314
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,280
I thought we'd
have fun eating
under the harvest moon.

315
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,720
# Shine on #

316
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:23,090
# Shine on, harvest moon
Up in the sky #

317
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,890
Aaah!
<i>Bye-bye.!</i>

318
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,530
Hey, hold it.

319
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,340
Hey, Fatso,
you smell somethin'?
Yeah!

320
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,280
No, besides him.
<i>Hello?</i>

321
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,710
Huh? Hey!

322
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,480
<i>Hello?</i>

323
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,650
<i>Hello?</i>

324
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,390
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

325
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,520
The idea, don't be afraid.

326
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,470
I'd like to make contact
with you, but just one
little thing, please.

327
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,340
Don't pop out from under a rug
or through a keyhole.
No spooking.

328
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:12,040
Let's get beyond that.
I would like to approach you.

329
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,050
Now, I'm coming
in the room now.

330
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:19,210
I'm in, in the room.

331
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,120
Can ya deal with that?

332
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,560
<i>Can you?</i>

333
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,670
Dive!
Dive!

334
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,670
Dive! Huh?

335
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,470
<i>Dad.!</i>

336
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,670
Dad?

337
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,860
I'm gonna kill you,

338
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,700
your mama and all her
bridge-playin' friends.

339
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:18,070
You think you got it tough?
I got a face-lift. There was
one just like it underneath.

340
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,010
Hmph? Hmph?

341
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,570
Aaah!

342
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,450
Aah! Aah-aah!

343
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,650
Aaah!

344
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,130
Aah!

345
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,560
<i>Dad? Dad?</i>

346
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,120
Hey, boys, we got
a closet case here.

347
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,390
Smell-o-gram.

348
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,700
<i>Sushi, anyone?</i>
<i>California roll coming up.</i>

349
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,170
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

350
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,830
All for one, and one for all!

351
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,500
Catch your pants
before they fall.

352
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,030
On the runway now,
we have Dr. James Harvey,
wearing smashing underwear.

353
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,200
Marky Mark he's not!

354
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,280
You are good.

355
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,380
Oh, stop. It's you.
Are we scary or what?

356
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,820
Aiii-ya!

357
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,960
Oh, and it looks as if
we're gonna go into
sudden death overtime.

358
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,770
Anybody for
a little shish ka-doc?
I am!

359
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,100
Hah!

360
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,640
Yeow!

361
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,410
Ha-ha!

362
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,110
<i>En garde.!</i>
Ha, ha!

363
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,180
Kitchie-koo!

364
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,930
Who do you think you are,
defiling our domicile, huh?

365
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,060
Dr. James... Harvey,
your... therapist.

366
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,230
Dad? Dad?

367
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,480
Are you okay?

368
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,340
Dad?

369
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,390
Dad?

370
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,930
Yaa!

371
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,090
<i>He's down for the count.</i>

372
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,800
<i>The winner...</i>
<i>by a clean stink-out.!</i>

373
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,340
Ha!

374
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,470
Get back.
What the hell
is that thing?

375
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,640
- Ha, ha!

376
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,850
Not the nose!

377
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,580
I'm bein' hosed!

378
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,490
No, no, no, no, no!

379
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,020
Th-Th-This sucks!

380
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,330
<i>Dad?</i>

381
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,370
Are you okay?

382
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,570
Oh, I'm fine.
Why don't we go,
uh, regroup?

383
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,200
<i>Get your hand</i>
<i>out of my mouth.!</i>

384
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,210
<i>Oh, man, who let one?</i>
<i>Well, who do you think?</i>

385
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,410
<i>Who's got their</i>
<i>pointy head in my</i>...
<i>That's not my head.</i>

386
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,750
<i>You know, fellows, we're</i>
<i>never this close anymore.</i>

387
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,960
Morning!

388
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,870
Oh, no, please don't scream.
L-I promise I won't hurt you.

389
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,370
I'm a ghost, yes, I admit it.
But I'm a friendly ghost.
You have to trust me.

390
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,000
If you scream,
you'll wake up my uncles,
and they get awfully cranky.

391
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,200
I'm gonna
let you go now, okay?

392
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,610
You're so cold.

393
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,880
Yeah, but it saves
on the heating bill. Ha!

394
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,820
<i>Come on.</i>

395
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,930
It's okay.

396
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,460
I can see
right through you.

397
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,760
Kind of happens
when you don't have any skin.

398
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,310
Wh... What are you made of?

399
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,570
Well, you know that
tingling feeling when
your foot falls asleep?

400
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,170
I think
I'm made of that.

401
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,130
Um, sunny-side up
kind of makes me yak.

402
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,540
No problem.

403
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,450
So, can you go invisible?

404
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,060
Ha, ha.
That one's easy.

405
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,600
It's fresh.

406
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,110
Go ahead.

407
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,580
I've never
done this before.
Me neither.

408
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,380
Can you hurt me?
N-No.

409
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,480
Can I hurt you?
No.

410
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,370
Cool.

411
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,540
Morning, Dr. Harvey.
Uh, some breakfast?

412
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,880
Uh, hmph. Uh...

413
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,410
Well, uh, yeah.

414
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,690
Honey? You okay?

415
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,690
Good.

416
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,900
How about a paper?
<i>The New York Times?</i>
<i>The Journal?</i>

417
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,770
<i>Hong Kong Press?</i>
Sure.

418
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,770
Comin' at ya.

419
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:40,750
Well...
Hope you're hungry.

420
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,430
# Da, da-da-da, da
Da, da-da-da, da #

421
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,460
# Da, da-da-da, da
Da, da-da-da, da #

422
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,340
I love the smell
of fleshies in the morning.

423
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,950
I'm melting!
I'm melting!

424
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,420
Auntie Phlegm!
Auntie Phlegm!

425
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,160
<i>Oh, what a world.!</i>

426
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,190
What a world!

427
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,380
They're gone.
What happened?

428
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,010
They must have
crossed over.

429
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,580
Don't think so!
Guess again, bonebag!

430
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,760
Fellas, good morning.

431
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,790
Casper!

432
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:07,270
How dare you serve
these air-sucking intruders
before us.

433
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,770
I was just...
Give me...

434
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,940
My meal!

435
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,050
Okay, okay.

436
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,020
Mmm!
Mmm!

437
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,820
Mmm!

438
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:27,620
<i>I feel like Oprah</i>
<i>on hiatus.</i>

439
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,090
<i>You look like</i>
<i>Oprah on hiatus.</i>

440
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,460
Ketchup, please.

441
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,370
Yum, yum! Yum!

442
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,900
You know what the problem is?
Casper's got no respect for us.

443
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,000
After all we've done
for the little glowworm.

444
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,340
Yeah. What the hell do you
think you're doin', bulbhead?

445
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,040
<i>This floor used to be</i>
<i>dirty enough to eat off of.</i>

446
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,380
But we have company.
Oh, yeah?

447
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,680
Well, company loves misery.
Boom!

448
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,720
You guys are disgusting,
obnoxious creeps.

449
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,350
Thank you!

450
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,950
What's your problem?
He's just cleaning the floor.

451
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,260
Shut up, skinbag.
Piss off.

452
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,700
Take a hike.
Get a grave.

453
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,540
Honey!
You've got the school thing.
You don't wanna be late.

454
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,540
<i>"Don't wanna be late."</i>
Drop dead!

455
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,170
- <i>It's too late.!</i>
- You'll have a lot of fun.

456
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,580
I know you will!

457
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,110
All right, guys.

458
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,920
We've obviously gotten off
on the wrong foot here.

459
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:37,590
Now, you know and I know
that you really shouldn't be here.

460
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,630
So I'll tell you what.

461
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,630
Why don't you go ahead
and finish your meal...

462
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:48,140
and we can meet in my office and
start the process of crossing over.

463
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,230
What do you say?

464
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,620
Well, it's your hour.

465
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,590
Watch it!

466
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,190
Hey, Amber!
Wait up!

467
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,640
<i>Hey, you guys.</i>

468
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,440
Whoa!
Whoa!

469
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,320
Had that locker
last year.

470
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,060
Thanks.

471
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,270
My name's Vic.

472
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,740
Kat.

473
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,740
Coming, Vic?

474
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,310
<i>Okay, gang, let's settle down.</i>

475
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,910
Put a lid on it!
Ow!

476
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,820
Okay, I've got a couple
of announcements to make.

477
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,320
First,

478
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,490
the asbestos removal
from the gym is taking
longer than planned.

479
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,790
We're gonna have to push back
the Halloween dance
by a couple of months.

480
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,340
Well, as most of you know,
my parents have finished
the new boathouse.

481
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,280
So I'm sure it'd be no problem
having the party at my place.

482
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,740
<i>Great.!</i>

483
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,910
That's done. Secondly,
we have a new student today.

484
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,250
I'd like you all to meet
Harvey Kathleen.

485
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,680
Would you like to come up
and say hi to everyone for me?

486
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,940
<i>So, why don't you tell us</i>
<i>something special about</i>
<i>yourself, Kathleen?</i>

487
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,210
Um, well, it's Kat.

488
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,320
And, um, I guess
I just moved here...

489
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,150
<i>with my dad</i>
<i>from Santa Fe.</i>

490
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,690
And Friendship seems
like a pretty friendly place.

491
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:30,300
<i>So where are you guys living?</i>

492
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,300
<i>In outer space?</i>

493
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,900
No. Whipstaff?

494
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,670
You've heard of it?

495
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,740
You actually live there?

496
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:49,520
<i>I know it looks kind of funky</i>
<i>and stuff from the outside.</i>

497
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:54,580
But, I mean, I don't know...
Inside it's kind of cool.

498
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,750
Well, yeah,
if you drink blood.

499
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,790
Mr. Curtis, check this.
We're dead for
the Halloween dance, right?

500
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,830
This girl has a seriously,
seriously creepy house
with room to spare.

501
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:12,280
I thought we were
having the party
at my place.

502
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,640
Oh? Okay,
we'll take a vote.

503
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:19,050
Whoever wants the party
at my house, raise your hand.

504
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,250
Whipstaff?
<i>Yeah.!</i>

505
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,480
Oh!

506
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:32,030
Johns Hopkins University?
Very impressive.

507
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,070
<i>Very. Pull.!</i>

508
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,860
<i>Pow.!</i>

509
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,630
<i>Pull.!</i>

510
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:46,470
Not... this one.
Thank you, gentlemen.

511
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,740
Hey, what a dish, Doc!
The little missus perhaps?

512
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,310
Hubba, hubba!

513
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,480
Fatso, you animal.
She available, Doc?

514
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:59,490
She's my wife Amelia.
She's deceased.
Even better.

515
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,930
But... we're not here
to talk about me.

516
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,790
See? Now don't
you feel just awful?
I was just goofin'.

517
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,270
Don't be goofin' on Amelia.
She's as nice a person
as they come.

518
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,530
<i>She's always treated you right,</i>
<i>huh, Stinkie?</i>

519
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,540
<i>I got no complaints.</i>
<i>She's always been</i>
<i>an angel to me.</i>

520
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,910
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

521
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,170
<i>I'm sayin:</i>
<i>She's a peach.</i>

522
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,480
<i>None better. Why?</i>
You've actually seen her?

523
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,580
You think I'm blind?
Of course I've seen her.

524
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,750
Who hasn't?
You're not lookin' for her,
are ya, Doc?

525
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:38,230
Well, that's not really
the focus of our sessions
here, is it?

526
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,630
But as long as
you raised the issue,

527
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,230
you wouldn't have a way...

528
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,200
of contacting others
like yourselves, would you?

529
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,870
Hmm?

530
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,840
I didn't think so.

531
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,970
Now, that's not generally
allowed there, Doc.

532
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,540
<i>Ya gotta go</i>
<i>through channels.</i>

533
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,680
Paperwork.
Red tape.

534
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,480
A holy mess, you know?
But for you?

535
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,150
I don't know.
Maybe we could work
somethin' out.

536
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:13,160
You keep that ghoul
Crittenden off our backs,

537
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,290
and I'd say we got
a deal, right, boys?

538
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,700
Mm-hmm!

539
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,500
Deal?
Deal.

540
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,070
Fatso, you know
where Amelia floats.
Go!

541
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,570
It's that easy, huh?

542
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,670
We got a ghost-to-ghost
network.

543
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,450
We share haunting stories.
We throw parties.

544
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,780
The parties are always
pretty dead, though.

545
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,750
That was fast.

546
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,060
<i>I</i>... <i>I think</i>
<i>it's for you, Doc.</i>

547
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,340
Go.

548
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,540
Amelia?

549
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,010
My man!

550
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,820
Vic?

551
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:47,950
What are you do...
I mean, hi.

552
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,290
Can I come in?

553
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,560
Uh, no, no.

554
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,120
It's so much nicer
out here...

555
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,230
in the flesh...
fresh air.

556
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,330
So did ya ask your dad
about the party?

557
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:08,350
Y-Yeah, yeah. He, um,
kind of hit the ceiling,

558
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,810
but, um, I think
it's gonna be okay.

559
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,180
Cool. So, listen,
if you're not hooked up
with anybody else,

560
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,320
you wanna...
I don't know... hang out
with me at the party?

561
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,790
I'd love to.

562
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:27,700
All right, cool.
All right, see ya.

563
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,200
Okay.

564
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,570
Yes!

565
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,240
Well, did you ask her?
Yeah.

566
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,520
And she actually
believed you?

567
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:54,890
This really bites.
No, it's absolutely perfect.

568
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,870
Hey!

569
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,640
See? I'm a good dancer.
Whoa!

570
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,150
Don't need a costume.

571
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,350
I'm always the life
of the party.

572
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,620
Casper, listen.
I know you want to go.

573
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:30,680
Come on. We'd have
a great time together.

574
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,920
Casper, I have a date.

575
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,590
What's this Vic guy got
that I don't, huh?

576
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:40,330
A pulse?
Big fleshy deal.

577
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,400
A tan.
Very bad for your skin.

578
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,370
How about a reflection?

579
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,780
Okay, okay,
but can he do this?

580
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,720
Come with me if you want to live.

581
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,690
Casper?

582
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,700
Casper! No! Don't!

583
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,100
Casper, no!
Casper, no! No, no, no, no!

584
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,370
Casper, no. Oh, my God!
High! This is very high!

585
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,000
Casper! Casper!

586
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,390
Casper,
this is beautiful.

587
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,950
I come here every night.

588
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:42,230
Alone?
Mm-hmm.

589
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,240
What were you like
when you were alive?

590
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:51,240
I was... I was...

591
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:53,470
I don't remember.

592
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,680
You don't remember
anything from your life?

593
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,680
No.

594
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,550
So... Nothing?

595
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,680
No.

596
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,920
You don't remember
what school you went to,
how old you were?

597
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,720
Your favorite song?

598
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,430
What about your dad?
Hm-mmm.

599
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,990
Not even your mom?

600
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,870
Is that bad?
No.

601
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,810
It's just kind of sad.

602
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:38,220
I wonder why you
don't remember anything.

603
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:43,730
Hmm? Guess 'cause
when you're a ghost,

604
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,030
life doesn't matter
that much anymore.

605
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,360
So you forget.

606
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,170
Sometimes I worry
that I'm trying to forget.

607
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,440
Forget what?

608
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:02,070
My mom.
Just certain things.

609
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,410
The sound of her making
breakfast downstairs.

610
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,780
The way she put on
her lipstick...

611
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,220
so carefully.

612
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:19,300
I do remember...
she always used Ivory soap.

613
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,560
And when she'd hug me,
I'd breathe her in...

614
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,330
so deep.

615
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,400
And I remember,
before I'd go to sleep,

616
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,930
she'd whisper in my ear,
"Stardust in the eyes,

617
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:37,780
rosy cheeks and a happy girl
in the morning."

618
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,010
Casper?

619
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,480
Hmm?

620
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,360
If my mom's a ghost,
did she forget about me?

621
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,890
No, she'd
never forget you.

622
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,900
Kat?
Mm-hmm?

623
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:07,710
If I were alive, would you go to
the Halloween dance with me?

624
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,870
Mm-hmm.

625
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,640
Kat?
Hmm?

626
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,520
Can I keep you?
Mm-hmm.

627
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,960
Casper, close the window.
It's cold.

628
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,620
Hey, Dad!

629
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,160
Found your Visa card.

630
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,420
Where was it?
Um, in your wallet.

631
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,330
Maybe I could use it to buy
this perfect costume I saw
in a store downtown.

632
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,060
You always
made your costume.
No, Mom did.

633
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:09,070
I think I could come up
with something pretty good.

634
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:13,630
Why don't we roll you
in aluminum foil, and you
could go as a leftover?

635
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,480
Don't worry.
You always look cute.

636
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:24,680
I don't wanna look cute.
Cute's like when
you're nine years old...

637
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,250
and you've got papier-mache
around your head.

638
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:33,700
I want to look... nice.
Mm-hmm.

639
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:38,030
Like... Like date nice.

640
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:44,800
Really? Uh...

641
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,640
Honey, I think maybe
it's time that we...

642
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,880
<i>sat down and</i>...
It's a little late
for that, Dad.

643
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:57,750
- How late?
- Oh, don't worry.
Not that late.

644
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,190
Oh, good.

645
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,160
You know that I would love
to buy you everything you wanted.

646
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:09,330
But until Miss Crittenden
pays me, that thing
is pretty worthless.

647
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,390
Oh, well, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

648
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,500
I'm sure I can come up
with something perfect
for the party.

649
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:20,170
<i># It's my party and</i>
<i>I'll die if I want to #</i>

650
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,110
<i># Die if I want to #</i>

651
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,580
Dad, please,
whatever you do,

652
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,710
don't let those guys
crash it.

653
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:35,320
Oh, no, I think they're actually
getting to be quite focused now.

654
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:41,460
<i># You will die too</i>
<i>when it happens to you #</i>

655
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,760
<i># Da, da, da-da, da, da #</i>

656
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,930
<i>Big finish.!</i>

657
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,100
<i>Scream or sugar?</i>

658
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:12,720
<i>Vell, vell, ze patient</i>
<i>has finally arrived.</i>

659
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,850
Late again, I see.

660
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:18,050
Could this be an expression
of hostility, Doc?

661
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:23,190
<i>It's your hour, Freud.</i>

662
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:29,710
What? So silent?
No pearls of wisdom
today, Doc?

663
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:34,270
Come on, Doc.
Stay tough. Don't stop.

664
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,010
Come on, Doc.
Hang with us homeboys.

665
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,950
Hey, wait a second.
What?

666
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,010
You ain't thinkin'
about packin' it in now,
are ya, Doc?

667
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,750
We were just startin'
to have fun.

668
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:50,390
It ain't often we meet
a bonebag as amusin' as you.

669
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,420
Boys, this is serious.
I think the doc is havin'
one of them fleshy breakdowns.

670
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,630
<i>Time for drastic measures.</i>

671
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:59,470
Think we should break
into a song?
No!

672
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,100
It's time we gave the doc
our own prescription.

673
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:06,300
What about the party?
The party will have to wait.

674
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,680
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?
Gentlemen?

675
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,580
Happy hour!
Happy hour!
Happy hour.

676
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,950
Whoop...
Yee-haw!

677
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,040
<i># Ninety-nine bottles of beer</i>
<i>on the wall #</i>

678
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,960
<i># Ninety-nine bottles of beer #</i>
<i>Just the dead guys.!</i>

679
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,590
This is an outrage.
This is appalling.

680
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,690
You pay a man to get
the ghosts out of the house,
and what does he do?

681
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,730
He gets the ghosts
out of the house.
Exactly.

682
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,380
It's about time.

683
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,920
Ohh!
Look familiar?

684
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,900
This is...

685
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,900
This is...

686
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,240
And...

687
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,740
I know this.

688
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,210
I had five fingers.

689
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,220
I remember!

690
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,410
Hootie!

691
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,030
<i>Chugga-chugga,</i>
<i>chugga-chugga.</i>

692
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:32,030
And wait!

693
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,370
Check it out.

694
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,370
<i>Hands up, Kat.</i>

695
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,120
Oh, wow.
It was my mom's.

696
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,050
Can I...
Go ahead.

697
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,000
Oh, Casper,
it's perfect.

698
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,240
You think I could wear it
to the party tonight?

699
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,680
Casper?

700
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,080
I begged and begged my dad
to get me this sled,

701
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,850
and he acted like
I couldn't even have it,

702
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,720
'cause I didn't know
how to ride it.

703
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,560
And then one morning,
I... I came down
for breakfast,

704
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,030
and there it was,
just for me.

705
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,120
For no reason at all.

706
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:49,740
I took it out,
went sledding all day,

707
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,570
and my dad said,
"That's enough,"
but I couldn't stop.

708
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,700
I was having so much fun.

709
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,710
Then it got late.

710
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,720
It got dark.

711
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,720
Got cold.

712
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,920
And I got sick.
My dad got sad.

713
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,930
What's it like to die?

714
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,400
Like being born.

715
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,330
Only backwards.

716
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:29,240
I remember I didn't go
where I was supposed to go.

717
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,910
I just stayed behind...

718
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,210
so my dad
wouldn't be lonely.

719
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,130
Is that your dad?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

720
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:58,260
"McFadden claimed that he
was haunted by the ghost
of his dead son,

721
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,610
"and that he
invented a machine
to bring him back to life:

722
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,610
The Lazarus."
The Lazarus.

723
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,350
Ooh.

724
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,520
Hee-hee. Sorry.
I guess we'll have
to take the long way.

725
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,560
Hurry up!
Come on!

726
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:25,390
My dad hid it
so no one can find it,
but I remember where it is!

727
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,530
<i>Ha.!</i>
<i>Wait'll you see it.</i>

728
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,280
- Don't you know a shortcut?
- You got it.

729
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:46,410
Casper, no!
Wall... human?

730
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:48,460
Stop!

731
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,590
<i>Hey.! Over here.</i>

732
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,600
Go ahead.
Sit down.

733
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,270
I would hold on.
Why?

734
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:24,120
Casper!

735
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,250
Well?

736
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,980
What was that?
The "Up and At 'Em" machine.

737
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:03,150
My dad was a great inventor,
but he had a little trouble
getting going in the morning.

738
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:05,530
Didn't he ever hear
of caffeine?

739
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,130
- Dibs!

740
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:19,300
Wha...

741
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,580
What is all this?

742
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,250
My dad's lab.
Kind of a slob,
wasn't he?

743
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,990
Down here, he could do
whatever he wanted to.
But no matter how busy he was,

744
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:38,050
he would drop everything
to play pirates with me.

745
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:40,530
<i>Man, we had</i>
<i>so much fun.</i>

746
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:45,260
Aye, matey.
Buccaneers and buried gold.
Whipstaff doth a treasure hold.

747
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,300
Oh!
Come on.

748
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,310
Dibs!
Oh!

749
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,140
So where's this
Lazarus thing?
<i>You're lookin'at it.</i>

750
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:59,050
Down there?
Huh. That's useful.

751
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,380
Oh, I know there's a way
to get it going.
I just can't...

752
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:05,420
What about that?
That?

753
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,650
Nah. That's the vault.

754
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:13,020
Wait!
It's gotta be this!

755
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,560
Hey, I did it!

756
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,620
Lazarus!

757
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:53,460
Ah. Ooh. Ouch.

758
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,590
What is this?
Careful!

759
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:18,020
That's what makes
the whole thing work.

760
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,780
Kind of an instant
primordial soup mix.

761
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:24,360
It's what brings ghosts
back to life.

762
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,720
Just enough for one.

763
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,070
- Pull the lever.
- Which one?

764
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,080
I don't know.
Try one.

765
01:08:57,090 --> 01:09:01,360
- Casper?
- I'm gonna be alive.

766
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,640
Oh, man, how am I
gonna do this?

767
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:16,650
I couldn't even get
my Easy Bake oven to work.

768
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,090
Okay.

769
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,220
Casper?

770
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,100
Am I alive?

771
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:18,940
Dibs, do you have any idea
what this means?
Yes!

772
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,080
No.
You don't have to be scared
of death anymore.

773
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,620
One minute you'll be a ghost;
next, you're back on your feet,

774
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:29,080
free to come and go
as you please.

775
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:32,210
Hell, you could even
fly through...
Walls.

776
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,950
Thick walls.
Thick as steel.

777
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,850
Certainly could get to
whatever's behind those walls.

778
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:44,300
Like a, a treasure,
for example?
And snap, crackle, pop:

779
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:48,030
You're back alive
and on your way
to the Riviera.

780
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:51,040
If you were a ghost.

781
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:53,740
If you were.

782
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:59,270
<i>Damn it, Dibs.</i>
<i>This won't hurt a bit.</i>

783
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:03,840
<i>Stop being such a weenie.!</i>
<i>It's just business.</i>
<i>Come on.!</i>

784
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,580
- If you would just...

785
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:10,680
Whoa.
Wa-a-a-a!

786
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,840
<i>So there you are.</i>

787
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:40,150
Dibs, you're takin' this
way too personally.

788
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,740
Carrigan!

789
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:06,340
Are you
a ghost yet?

790
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,050
Carrigan!

791
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,780
What a tragic waste.

792
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,920
She had my favorite sunglasses.

793
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,460
<i>Not so fast, little man.</i>

794
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,970
<i>The bitch is back.</i>
Wha...

795
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:35,770
# Warden threw a party
at the county jail #

796
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:38,540
# The prison band was there
They began to wail #

797
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,680
<i># The band played hard</i>
<i>The joint began to swing #</i>

798
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,910
# You should've heard
those knocked-out
jailbirds sing #

799
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:45,920
# Let's rock #

800
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:49,690
Hey, this Dr. Harvey's got
a lot of spirit, you know
what I'm sayin'?

801
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,290
Yeah, but he's got
his whole miserable
life ahead of him.

802
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,060
So we could do him a favor
and put him out of his misery.

803
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:59,360
Yeah. Hey,
good idea.

804
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,530
We been the ghostly trio
long enough.

805
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:06,570
Time to make it a...
quartet!

806
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,120
Could I just
say something here?

807
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:25,060
- And get a little personal?
- Oh, yeah.
You know how it is. Okay.

808
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,500
Well, I just
got to tell you...

809
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:34,870
you guys remind me
of what it's like to
hang out with the boys.

810
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:40,170
I mean, you are absolutely
there for each other.

811
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,080
<i># Falling in love... #</i>

812
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:45,740
I mean, you look life
right in the face.

813
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:49,220
You say, "I'm a ghost.
I don't need you. Mmm."

814
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:53,250
You know what? I'm gonna
tell that Miss Critten Picken...

815
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,790
Uh, Crichton Critten...
Crut...

816
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:02,760
I'm gonna tell that lady
you aren't goin' anywhere.

817
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:06,030
It's your house.
You're haunting it.

818
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,430
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law.

819
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,440
No.
No.
No.
Yes.

820
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:12,600
No.
No.
No.
Yes.

821
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:17,050
Aww.
Aww.
I didn't think so
at first, but...

822
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,050
you guys are great.

823
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,740
I love you... guys.

824
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:26,380
Hey. Hey!

825
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,480
Eeow!

826
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,960
Eeeeee!
Ohh!

827
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:34,160
Hey.
Noooo.

828
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,130
Heh-heh.

829
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,140
Oof!

830
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,400
What a sweetheart.

831
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,140
I can't croak him now.

832
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,550
Me neither.
No way.

833
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,580
All right, boys!

834
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,890
The night is young.
Mm-hmm.

835
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,790
We are gonna clean out
every bar this town has got.

836
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,660
Uh-uh-uh.

837
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:12,200
We're gonna booze it
until we lose it.

838
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:14,200
Come on.
Come on.

839
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:17,760
<i>Whoop.</i>

840
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:29,990
Think my ears
just popped.

841
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,830
<i>Come to Mama.</i>

842
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:45,060
- My treasure!
- You mean <i>my</i> treasure.

843
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:48,330
Uhhh.
Miss Crittenden?

844
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,240
In the flesh.
Well, in a couple of minutes.

845
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:54,900
- <i>Oh.! Ah.! Oh.!</i>

846
01:15:56,780 --> 01:16:00,270
Dibs! What are you doing?
This is no time to shave.

847
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:03,380
Helping you, remember?
Remember what?

848
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:05,390
This!

849
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:09,150
You stole that.
That's Casper's.

850
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:12,390
So sue me. Dibs!
The capsule! Now!

851
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,950
Coming.
I'm coming, okay?

852
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:24,100
<i>Keep away from me.</i>

853
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,810
Here. Jump in.

854
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:53,900
Oh!

855
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,900
Oy.
Perfect.

856
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:04,870
- We're here.
- Uh, okay.

857
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,780
Hi. Come on in.
This is the room.

858
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:11,380
Um, stay together;
you'll be safe.
And I'll be right back.

859
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,790
Amber, do we
have to do this?

860
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:25,960
Hey, she wants a Halloween party,
she's gonna get a Halloween party.

861
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,050
Hey, that's
my treasure!
Stay back!

862
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,090
Keep away from me.
Casper!

863
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,490
Don't come near me,
you spiteful spook, or I'll
knock you into the next world.

864
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,430
Come on.
Let's go.

865
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,840
# Ta-da #

866
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:06,930
Hey, "poppin' fresh,"
it's <i>my</i> turn in the oven.

867
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:11,340
Dibs! Get this thing cooking,
you blasted little worm you!

868
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:17,880
Ah... Carrigan.
How kind of you to drop in.

869
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,220
<i>You know,</i>

870
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:22,820
if there's one thing I've
learned from you, it's:

871
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,950
Always kick 'em
when they're down.

872
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:30,430
And, baby,
you're six feet under.
Oh, what a shame.

873
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,400
Sorry, sweetheart.
We're through.

874
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:39,640
I am not gonna
forget this, you ungrateful,
lousy little worm you.

875
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:43,270
Oh, you can haunt me
all you want,

876
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:46,980
but it's gonna be
in a great big,
expensive house...

877
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:49,450
with lovely
purple wallpaper...

878
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,250
and great big
green carpets...

879
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,290
and a little dog
called Carrigan...

880
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,380
a bitch just like you.

881
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,400
I got the power.
I got the treasure.

882
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:04,560
And you have
a flight to catch.

883
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,500
Any other takers?

884
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:13,840
No. But aren't you
forgetting something?

885
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:16,110
What?

886
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:18,110
Your unfinished
business.

887
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:21,380
- My what?
- You know,

888
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:23,420
unfinished business.

889
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:28,010
All ghosts have unfinished business.
That's why they don't cross over.

890
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:31,890
Unfinished business?
I have no unfinished business.

891
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:36,160
I have my treasure, my mansion.
I have everything.

892
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,400
I'm just perfect.

893
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:43,130
<i>Wait.! Wait.!</i>
<i>I lied.</i>

894
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:45,870
I have unfinished business,
lots of unfinished business.

895
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:48,570
L-I'm not ready
to cross over yet.

896
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:51,580
Wait! You tricked me,
you rotten little brats!

897
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,070
My treasure!
A ball?
That's your treasure?

898
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:23,080
Are you kidding? It's
autographed by Duke Snyder,
the Brooklyn Dodgers.

899
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:25,510
My favorite player.

900
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:28,280
Casper, it's time.

901
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:38,190
<i>Honey.!</i>
<i>I'm home.!</i>

902
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,700
Whoooaaa-ehhhh-whoo-ohhh!

903
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:46,060
Ooh.
Dad?

904
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,930
No! What have you
done to him?

905
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:52,460
Nothin'. He's just
a little... dead.

906
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,200
I'm free!
I've never felt
so good in my life.

907
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,840
I can fly-y-y-eee!

908
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,480
Rookie.
Stinkie,
work with him.

909
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,750
Dad?
Yeah.

910
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:08,190
Hey!
Who's the girl?
Dad, it's me.

911
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:12,130
L-It's Kat.
Kat. Kat?

912
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,490
- Kat Ballou.
- Katatonic.

913
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,290
Katastrophic.
Kreplach soup.

914
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,640
<i>Ohh.</i>

915
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:27,770
- Flesh flood alert.
- Dad?

916
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,780
Don't you remember?

917
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:35,240
Oh, yeah!
I remember!

918
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,580
No!

919
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:42,610
<i>No. No.!</i>
<i>This.</i>

920
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,390
Oh.

921
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,430
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

922
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,940
Oh, Kat!

923
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,270
Oh, sweetheart.

924
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:00,040
Oh, what have I done?
I... Oh, Kat.

925
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:03,640
Don't cry. I...
Oh, please.

926
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:08,040
Come on, Dr. Harvey.
You need this
more than I do.

927
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:14,020
Casper.

928
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:16,850
This is the way
it's gotta be.

929
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,390
Dad?
Oh, Kat!

930
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:51,220
Oh! Ohh, Kat.

931
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:54,060
Aww. Hey.

932
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:59,260
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

933
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:02,570
Oh, that felt like
the strangest dream.

934
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:09,740
I... I thought we
almost lost each other
for a minute there.

935
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,710
Oh, Bucket.

936
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:24,820
Your party started
without you.

937
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,770
Your date's
probably waiting.

938
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:33,770
Maybe we should
get going.

939
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:41,300
Uh...
where are we?

940
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,190
Well, go ahead.
What about you?

941
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:06,290
Hey, this is your party.
Go do your thing.

942
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:11,640
Go hang.
Or chill or kick it or
whatever you call it.

943
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,500
I think you got
a date out there.

944
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:19,010
Thanks, Dad.

945
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,020
I hope no one saw that.

946
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:38,030
Hold still!
I'm trying.
Could you weigh any more?

947
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,360
Just shut up and
get your head down.

948
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:46,300
Oh, my... Oh,
you gotta see this.

949
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,780
People are gonna freak.

950
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,780
Let me see.

951
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,520
Cool.

952
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:57,350
Thank you.

953
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,100
Yeah!

954
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,490
You're...
Uh-huh.

955
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:14,290
You're...
That's right.

956
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,560
Kat's mom?

957
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:20,570
Are... Are you
an angel?

958
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:25,630
That was a very noble thing
you did tonight, Casper.

959
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:30,480
I know Kat
will never forget it.
She needs her father.

960
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:33,950
And I know yours
will never forget it either.

961
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,750
You fulfilled
his greatest dream, Casper,

962
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:40,020
and I know he is
very, very proud of you.

963
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:44,750
And for what you've done,
I'm giving you your dream
in return.

964
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:48,730
<i>But</i> it's just for tonight.

965
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,730
Sort of a Cinderella deal.

966
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,030
- So I have
until midnight?
- 10:00.

967
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,770
Hey, Cinderella
got until midnight.

968
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,540
Cinderella wasn't 12 years old.

969
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,950
<i># Every now and then #</i>

970
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:22,050
<i># We find a special friend #</i>

01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:27,500

01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:16,280

986
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,700
<i># Remember me #</i>

987
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:44,240
<i># This way #</i>

988
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,450
I told you
I was a good dancer.

989
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,560
Can I keep you?

990
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,260
Casper?

991
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:47,800
Hello, James.

992
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:53,570
Amelia.

993
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:56,480
It's all right.

994
01:29:58,490 --> 01:30:00,420
It's just me.

995
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,560
I...

996
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,220
I thought I'd have
a hundred things
to say when I...

997
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,440
How?

998
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:18,740
Let's just say you know
three crazy ghosts
who kept their word.

999
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:24,540
James, I know you've
been searching for me.

1000
01:30:24,610 --> 01:30:27,950
But there's something
you have to understand.

1001
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,950
You and Kat loved me
so well when I was alive...

1002
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:33,750
that I have no
unfinished business.

1003
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:35,920
Please don't
let me be yours.

1004
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:37,930
But, Amelia,

1005
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,490
I don't...

1006
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:46,360
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

1007
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:49,760
What parent does?

1008
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:54,280
James, Kat is
growing up beautifully
because of you.

1009
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:59,540
No wonder
I miss you so much.

1010
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:03,420
Just a couple things,
though.

1011
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:07,790
Don't pick up the extension
every time she gets a phone call.

1012
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:10,990
French fries
are not a breakfast food.

1013
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:13,490
And don't ask her
to wear a T-shirt...

1014
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,830
under her...
Ah, under her bathing suit.

1015
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:20,200
I know.
Our daughter is...

1016
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:22,200
A teenager.
A teenager.

1017
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,660
Wait.

1018
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:54,230
Where are you going?

1019
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,500
Where I can watch over
both of you...

1020
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,630
until we're
together again.

1021
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:05,780
- Good-bye, James.

1022
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:28,500
Casper?

1023
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,290
Uh, ha. Boo?

1024
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,300
Not bad for
my first party, huh?

1025
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:13,540
Couldn't have
been better.

1026
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,640
It ain't over yet.
Boys!
