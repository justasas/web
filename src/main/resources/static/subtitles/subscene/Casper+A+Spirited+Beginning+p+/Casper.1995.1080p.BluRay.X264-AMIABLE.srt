1
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,804
Okay.

2
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,349
One picture and we're history.

3
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,977
That's what I'm afraid of.

4
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,646
Come on.

5
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,459
Man, do we have to do this?

6
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,336
You want everyone in school
to think we're chicken?

7
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,796
I could live with that.

8
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,548
You wuss. Come on.

9
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,854
I don't see anything. Do you?

10
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,565
No, I don't see anything.

11
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,737
Let's just take the picture
and get out of here.

12
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,364
Fine. Here, take the picture.

13
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:01,788
Wait, I should bein the picture, too,
or no one will believe I was here.

14
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,331
Shut up and take the picture!

15
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,624
You take the picture.

16
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,167
You take it! You!

17
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,212
Guys, don't fight.
I'll take the picture.

18
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,381
Say "cheese."

19
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,719
A ghost!

20
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,459
"...and to the Save the Dolphins Foundation
$11 million.

21
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:53,923
"To the Save the Pumas
Foundation, $1.2 million.

22
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,718
"To the Patagonian
Wasp Salvation Fund,

23
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,346
"$1.4 million.

24
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,516
"To the Dyslexic
Dalmatians Foundation..."

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,019
To hell with the livestock.
What did the old stiff leave me?

26
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,149
I believe that what the bereaved
is trying to express

27
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:16,571
is that the sudden death
of her only father

28
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,741
has left a great gaping void
in her bank... in her life.

29
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:26,330
And Carrigan wonders what he has left her
to fill it up with.

30
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,250
Let's see.

31
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,712
"Bobcats, owls,

32
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,505
"snakes,

33
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,258
"daughter Carrigan,

34
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,845
"Whipstaff Manor in Maine."

35
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,472
And?

36
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,268
And I'm late for lunch,
so if you'll excuse me...

37
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,898
Are you telling me that I just spent the
last two daysholding his clammy hand

38
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,943
waiting for him to kick it,and all
I get is one lousy piece of property?

39
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,321
No, it was lousy 50 years ago.

40
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,948
Now it's condemned. Enjoy.

41
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,954
Wait a minute.
This is not fair!

42
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,417
I'll contest, and then I'll drag you and
all of those damned dolphins into court.

43
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,085
Knock yourself out.

44
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,340
Dibs, this is all your fault.

45
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,468
As usual. If you would have
just forged the damn will.

46
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,220
This is condemned
seafront property.

47
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,681
Dibs, don't you get it?

48
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,726
Flipper got more money than me.

49
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,312
Carrigan! The deed's in there!

50
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,148
My God.

51
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,701
"Buccaneers and buried gold,

52
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,038
"Whipstaff doth
a treasure hold."

53
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,248
Treasure?

54
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,751
Dibs, you idiot! Get it out.

55
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,682
I knew that place was worth something.
There's treasure in that house

56
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,435
and finally, I'm going to
get what I deserve.

57
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,772
Carrigan,
I think I need a doctor.

58
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,399
There's plenty in Maine.

59
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,294
So, what do you think?

60
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,673
I think
you're going to get wet.

61
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,641
Wait! Carrigan!

62
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,986
Dibs, light!

63
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:09,910
What a dump.

64
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,334
This place is fabulous.

65
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,171
You could just
do so much with it.

66
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,840
I know it's a bit spooky. Dibs.

67
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,306
Hello.

68
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,934
Who is it?

69
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,021
Afraid I can't answer that.

70
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,147
Why not?

71
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,567
It's kind of hard to explain.

72
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,152
Is he the caretaker?

73
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,904
Are you the caretaker?

74
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,238
No.

75
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,990
Is he a drug dealer?

76
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,743
Is he... Are you a transient?

77
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,661
No, not exactly.

78
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,163
Then tell him to show himself.

79
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,664
Show yourself!

80
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,919
Here's the thing. If I do, don't scream, okay?
I get that a lot.

81
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,880
Are you a burglar?

82
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,425
I must warn you
that I am armed.

83
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,637
Hello?

84
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,517
Cut the crap. If you don't show yourself,
I'll have you arrested for trespassing.

85
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,936
Okay, calm down, lady.

86
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,938
Here I come!

87
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,860
Hi! I'm Casper.

88
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,949
No, you shouldn't do that,
or you'll wake the...

89
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,618
Too late.

90
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,114
So tell me.
You have experience?

91
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,994
I have quite a bit of experience. Not,
you know, like, exactly doing it,

92
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,873
but I've studied it,and I've talked to
people who have done it.

93
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:23,627
I've seen the videos, and I feel very
confident that with my knowledge

94
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,838
I could do it, no problem.

95
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,798
Then you can handle this?

96
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,470
It's like no problem whatsoever.
Piece of cake. Piece of crumb cake.

97
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,845
Well? How did it go?

98
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,100
It was fine. Was no problem.
Piece of cake.

99
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,151
Who you gonna call?

100
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,820
Someone else.

101
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,824
What do we do now?

102
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,327
What do I usually do when something
stands in my way?

103
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,513
Are you sure we're not going
a tad overboard here?

104
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,267
Dibs, I have huffed and puffed. Now I
want to rip this place down.

105
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,187
I want my treasure. They can't haunt a
pile of rubble, for Christ's sake.

106
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,944
People, please!

107
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,863
You're sweaty male construction types,
for Christ's sake!

108
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,490
Dibs, do something!

109
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,956
Come on, get out of there!

110
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,710
Charlie, quick, keep running and don't
look back! Run, Charlie!

111
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,713
Wait! They were just kidding!
Honest!

112
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,008
Every time.

113
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,719
All I want is a friend.

114
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,181
Did you ever feel the way
Priscilla Cow felt

115
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,560
that you'd like to be
completely different?

116
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,731
Almost everybody feels like
that once in a while.

117
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,150
But most of the time

118
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,361
I hope you can be glad
to be yourself.

119
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,906
That's really
something to celebrate.

120
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,244
A ghost!

121
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,667
More on the Pentagon playboys
as the story unfolds.

122
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,793
But, now...

123
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,255
step aside, Sigmund Freud.
Jump back, Joyce Brothers.

124
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,925
It's Dr. James Harvey,
therapist to the dead?

125
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,929
Are you depressed? Are you anxious?
Are you lonely?

126
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,098
Do you need someone to talk to?

127
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,267
No problem, if you're a ghost!

128
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,774
You can call them ghosts if you like
or as I prefer, the living impaired.

129
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,361
But the bottom line is,
they need help sometimes

130
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,113
just like the rest of us.

131
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,867
After the sudden unexpected death
of his wife, Amelia,

132
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,787
Dr. Harvey gave up
conventional psychiatry

133
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,206
and some say
conventional sanity.

134
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,959
Now, along with his loner daughter, Kat,
short for Kathy

135
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:55,964
Doc Harvey travels from town to town,
searching for paranoid poltergeists,

136
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,134
scared specters,
the depressed and the dead.

137
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,554
How do you feel about your father's
livelihood?

138
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,390
Please don't ask me
any questions.

139
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,725
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Ever seen one?

140
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,727
Does your father hurt you
in any way?

141
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,062
He's my father.

142
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,814
Could you just talk to us?

143
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,733
Look, it's the first day
of school

144
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,653
and I'm sure I'll have homework,
so could you please...

145
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,073
Carrigan.

146
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,843
What part don't you understand?

147
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,347
No, not "I ate fish."
I hate fish.

148
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,392
Don't you people have
cows here?

149
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,520
Listen, I have had
a long and trying day.

150
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,732
Do you think that you could bring me a pint
of Häagen-Dazs ice cream, rum raisin

151
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,861
and a Diet Pepsi?
Think you can handle that?

152
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,656
Now you want me to hold. Fine.

153
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,077
And with therapy they can begin to
process this pain.

154
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,873
They can pack up their emotional baggage,
and they can move on.

155
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,878
My Harry passed away five years ago,
but he was so miserable.

156
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,464
His spirit would not
leave the apartment.

157
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,508
So I called Dr. Harvey.
He came over

158
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,887
and in a few weeks Harry left

159
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,680
smiling.

160
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,350
The living-impaired
are known for haunting us.

161
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,353
My question is,
what's haunting them?

162
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,856
It's a lack of resolution.

163
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,026
Ghosts are simply spirits
without resolution.

164
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,113
With unfinished business.
And it's my job to find out what that is.

165
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,783
And so Dr. James Harvey
continues his work

166
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,954
dragging his daughter along for the ride.
This week they're in Santa Fe,

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,081
but next week, "boo" knows?

168
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,667
Now, from the ghost shrink
to shrinking...

169
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,879
Yes, I'm still here.
Get me Santa Fe.

170
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,019
That's life!

171
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,813
That's what all the people say

172
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,733
You're ridin' high in April

173
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,777
Shot down in

174
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,241
I'm sorry about
your Cactus Spooners.

175
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,367
Crooners.

176
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,745
I don't care what they said,
you are not demented.

177
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,539
You're a picture
of mental health.

178
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,624
They were talking about you.

179
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,587
Try explaining afterlife therapy to
a bunch of junior high kids.

180
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,383
Some people go through life
never questioning the norm.

181
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,761
But you and I, we're doing something
extraordinary with our lives.

182
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,347
No, we aren't doing anything.

183
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,185
You're the one who's been packing up my stuff
and moving me around the country.

184
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:59,398
I mean, in two years,
I have been to nine different schools.

185
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,025
I've eaten
in nine different cafeterias.

186
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,987
I mean, I can't even remember
anyone's name.

187
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,490
For once,
I would just like to be

188
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,660
in one place long enough
to make a friend.

189
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,412
Honey, you will.

190
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,621
Right.

191
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,083
I mean, come on, we're moving to
Friendship, Maine.

192
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,501
Even I might make one.

193
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,379
You better, Dad,
'cause a single guy your age

194
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,675
is more likely to become a bank hostage
than to make new friends.

195
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,637
You sound like your mother.

196
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,809
You're not gonna find her.

197
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,353
Mom's not a ghost, Dad.

198
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,192
Yes, she is.
She has unfinished business.

199
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,362
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

200
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,122
I'll tell you what

201
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,750
you go with me
this one last time.

202
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,378
If I don't find whati I'm looking for
then it's over.

203
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,757
No more moving,
no more ghost mining.

204
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,176
You promise?

205
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,721
I promise.

206
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,224
Deal.

207
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,403
It's not so bad.

208
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,323
If you're Stephen King.

209
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,997
Dr. Harvey, hello.
I'm Carrigan Crittenden.

210
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,457
And this is Dibs.

211
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,668
Hello.
I'm a close personal friend.

212
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,756
And this is my daughter, Kat.

213
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,176
His close personal daughter.

214
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,428
How nice to meet you, Kat.

215
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,180
Very nice to meet you.

216
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,015
You have a beautiful daughter.

217
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,308
Very beautiful.

218
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,811
We are very happy that you could come
all the way to Whipstaff.

219
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,104
Very happy.

220
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,355
The both of us.

221
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,859
You're kind of hurting my face.

222
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,112
Sorry. Now, Dr. Harvey

223
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,741
exactly what kind of
time frame are you looking at?

224
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:42,037
Please tell me you'll just go in the house
and spray and that's it.

225
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,041
No. As with a traditional
psychological cure

226
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,751
it can take weeks
or even years...

227
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,252
Excuse me!

228
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,671
Did you just say
the word "years"?

229
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,048
It's conceivable.

230
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,551
No, it isn't.
Days is conceivable.

231
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,928
Weeks, maybe.

232
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,054
Possibly.

233
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,974
Months, no. Years, forget it.

234
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,435
Forget it. Dibs, check.

235
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,231
Get the bouquet.
Now, Dr. Harvey

236
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,734
I will be watching you
very closely.

237
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,155
These are for you.

238
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,741
Have a lovely night.

239
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,567
Wow.

240
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,781
It's her. She's here.
She's in my house. I did it!

241
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,368
What if she likes me?
What if she doesn't?

242
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,955
"Hi, I'm Casper. I'm a ghost."

243
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,791
No, that's total disaster.

244
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,296
"Yo, I'm Casper.
What's up? Give me four."

245
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,716
God, I'd kill for a pinkie.

246
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,852
See? That was easy.

247
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,103
Yeah.

248
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,646
Pennies should hold for now

249
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,649
but we ought to get a box of 20 amps
in the morning.

250
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,487
Right, yeah,
20s should be fine.

251
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,409
All right, I'm gonna
go find a room, Dad.

252
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,828
You gonna be all right alone?

253
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,332
If I'm not back in 10 days,
send a search party.

254
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,666
"Stretch"

255
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,503
"Fatso"

256
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,048
and "Stinkie"?

257
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,971
Man, they had cruel parents.
I wonder where Doc and Dopey sleep.

258
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,457
Dad, I found my room!

259
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,757
There's a girl on my bed.

260
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,551
Yes!

261
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,268
Space master! In here.

262
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,023
It's very scary.

263
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,358
Have you seen
any surprises yet?

264
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,028
Please. This is
the deadest place yet.

265
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,239
This is a nice room.

266
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:49,451
Right. This place is
a freak's holiday.

267
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,338
Mom belongs over here.

268
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,719
How about if I help you unpack?

269
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:15,060
Why bother? We'll just be repacking
in two weeks anyway, right?

270
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,898
I'm kidding.

271
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,109
This place is fine.

272
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,864
Good.

273
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,367
Night, bucket.

274
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,911
Night, Dad.

275
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,376
We're gonna be glad we came.

276
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,337
You watch.

277
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,455
Hi.

278
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,751
Man!

279
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,672
Perfect first impression.
What a jerk!

280
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,812
Better?

281
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,357
Honey!

282
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,777
Honey, what?

283
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,905
Dad, I saw a ghost!

284
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,991
It was a real, live ghost! Slow down.
What are you saying?

285
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,868
I saw a ghost.

286
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,705
And it had a head, it was round, it was
white and see-through, and...

287
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,166
Wait a minute. Now maybe...
Dad, please.

288
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,461
Do not think I'm as crazy as I thought
you were. I promise.

289
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,131
No, but remember,
ghosts can't hurt you, okay?

290
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:53,301
They're simply spirits with unfinished
business, all right?

291
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,095
Let's just see about this
ghost, all right?

292
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,766
Come here. Come on.
Over here. Check here.

293
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,394
See? No ghost there.

294
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,105
And then we can check
over here, all right?

295
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,946
No, there's no ghost in there.
We can even check over here.

296
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,159
There. See?

297
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,165
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

298
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,922
Dad, put me down!

299
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,466
This is insane.
What are you doing?

300
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,135
I can walk, you know.

301
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,893
My God, this is big.

302
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,145
Dad? What?

303
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,189
We're in a closet.

304
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:54,904
Right now I want you to stay in here
no matter what you hear, okay?

305
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:56,781
Okay.

306
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,992
Wait! What?

307
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,660
Dad, I'm sorry.

308
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,704
For what?

309
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,916
For not believing you. For thinking
you were a total loser.

310
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,253
Apologize later.

311
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,381
Blew it!

312
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,759
Uh-oh.

313
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,386
It's them.

314
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,847
- Giddyup there!
- Go, horsie!

315
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,813
Man oh, man, them ponies run faster
when we go down to Belmont.

316
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,481
Here, Flicka.

317
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,444
Hey, guys. Have fun?

318
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,113
Look, it's Casper!

319
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:41,993
Now on a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being fun and 1 being you

320
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,078
yeah, we had fun.

321
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,290
Giddyup there.

322
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,626
Say, Bulbhead, why ain't you inside
doing your chores?

323
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:54,672
Yeah, where's dinner? I'm starving.
Look at me, I'm wasting away here.

324
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,218
I know. How about you guys relax out here
and tonight we'll eat alfresco?

325
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,304
Sounds great. Who's that?

326
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:05,058
Short-sheet, you wouldn't be trying to
keep us out of the house, would you?

327
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,225
No!

328
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,645
I can see right through that bulbous
little head of yours.

329
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,397
It's just such a lovely night.

330
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,692
I thought we'd have fun just eating
under the harvest moon.

331
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:19,614
Shine on, shine on harvest moon

332
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,574
Up in the sky

333
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,911
Bye-bye!

334
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,541
Hold it.

335
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,920
Fatso, you smell something?

336
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,296
Yeah.

337
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,798
No, besides him.

338
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,633
Hello?

339
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,437
No need to be afraid.

340
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,315
Yeah, right, don't be afraid.

341
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:00,738
I'd like to make contact with you, but just
one little thing, please.

342
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:05,451
Don't pop out from under a rug or through
a keyhole. No spooking.

343
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,870
Let's get beyond that.

344
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,790
I would like to approach you.

345
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,251
Now I'm coming in the room.

346
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,755
I'm in the room.

347
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,467
Can you deal with that?

348
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,228
Dive!

349
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,406
Dad?

350
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,763
I'm gonna kill you, your mama

351
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,349
and all her
bridge-playing friends.

352
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,103
You think you got it tough?
I got a facelift.

353
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,147
There was one
just like it underneath.

354
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,293
Dad?

355
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,839
Boys,
we got a closet case here!

356
00:30:58,649 --> 00:30:59,899
Smell-o-gram!

357
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,281
Sushi, anyone?

358
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,034
California roll coming up!

359
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,123
All for one and one for all!

360
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,126
Catch your pants
before they fall!

361
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,755
On the runway, we have Dr. James Harvey
wearing smashing underwear.

362
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,674
Marky Mark he's not!

363
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,517
You are good.

364
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,768
Stop. It's you.

365
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,728
Are we scary or what?

366
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:45,695
And it looks as if we're gonna go into
sudden death overtime.

367
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,241
Anybody for
a little shish ke-doc?

368
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,659
I am.

369
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,520
Who do you think you are
defiling our domicile?

370
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,941
Dr. James Harvey,
your therapist.

371
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,276
Dad!

372
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,867
Are you okay?

373
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:43,794
Dad.

374
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,016
And he's down for the count.

375
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,561
A winner by a clean stink out!

376
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,522
Get back.

377
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,358
What the hell is that thing?

378
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,115
Not the nose!

379
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,744
I'm being hosed!

380
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:18,371
No!

381
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,250
This sucks.

382
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,632
Dad? Are you okay?

383
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,597
I'm fine.
Why don't we go regroup?

384
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,433
Get your hand out of my mouth!
I found half a Twinkie!

385
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,893
Who let one? Who do you think?

386
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,645
Who's got their
pointy head in my...

387
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,813
That's not my head.

388
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,233
You know, fellas, we're never
this close anymore.

389
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:34,155
Morning. No, please don't scream.
I promise, I won't hurt you.

390
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,158
I'm a ghost. Yes, I admit it,
but I'm a friendly ghost.

391
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,369
You have to trust me. If you scream,
you'll wake up my uncles

392
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:44,373
and they get awfully cranky.
I'm gonna let you go now. Okay?

393
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,420
You're so cold.

394
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,881
Yeah, but it saves
in the heating, though.

395
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,678
Come on.

396
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,223
It's okay.

397
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,060
I can see right through you.

398
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:08,397
It kind of happens
when you don't have any skin.

399
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,278
What are you made of?

400
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,324
You know that tingling feeling
when your foot falls asleep?

401
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,075
I think I'm made of that.

402
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,474
Sunny-side up
kind of makes me yak.

403
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,975
No problem.

404
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,207
So, can you go invisible?

405
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,210
That one's easy.

406
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,841
It's fresh.

407
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,264
Go ahead.

408
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,224
I've never done this before.

409
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,476
Me, neither.

410
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,479
Can you hurt me? No.

411
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,231
Can I hurt you?

412
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,440
No.

413
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,916
Cool.

414
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:58,299
Morning, Dr. Harvey.
Some breakfast?

415
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,563
You okay?

416
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,814
Good.

417
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:23,699
How about a paper? The New York Times?
The Journal? Hong Kong Press?

418
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,452
Sure. Coming at you.

419
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,340
Hope you're hungry.

420
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,785
I love the smell of fleshies
in the morning.

421
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,459
I'm melting.

422
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,629
Auntie Phlegm.

423
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,049
What a world!

424
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,027
They're gone. What happened?

425
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,823
They must have crossed over.

426
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,869
Don't think so!

427
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,205
Guess again, Bonebag!

428
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,459
Fellas. Good morning.

429
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,795
Casper.

430
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:06,051
How dare you serve these air-sucking
intruders before us.

431
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,888
I was just... Give me my

432
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,850
meal!

433
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,688
Okay.

434
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,779
I feel like Oprah on hiatus.

435
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,323
You look like Oprah on hiatus.

436
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,078
Ketchup, please.

437
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,250
You know what the problem is?

438
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,003
Casper's got no respect for us.

439
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,339
After all we've done
for the little glowworm.

440
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,760
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Bulbhead?

441
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,763
This floor used to be
dirty enough to eat off of.

442
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,056
But we have company.

443
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,476
Yeah? Company loves misery.

444
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,149
You guys are disgusting,
obnoxious creeps.

445
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,317
Thank you.

446
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,522
I mean, what's your problem?

447
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,070
He's just cleaning the floor.

448
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,155
Shut up, Skinbag.

449
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,823
Piss off. Take a hike.

450
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,158
- Get a grave.
- Honey!

451
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,328
School thing and you don't
want to be late...

452
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,913
- Drop dead!
- Too late!

453
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:20,250
You go have a lot of fun.
I know you will.

454
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,677
All right, guys, we've obviously gotten off
on the wrong foot here.

455
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:36,350
Now, you know and I know that you
really shouldn't be here.

456
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,352
So I'll tell you what.

457
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,271
Why don't you go ahead
and finish your meal

458
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,273
and we can meet in my office

459
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,318
and start the process of
crossing over.

460
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,196
What do you say?

461
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,495
It's your hour.

462
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,836
Watch it!

463
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,676
Amber, wait up!

464
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,374
Had that locker last year.

465
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,001
Thanks.

466
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,088
My name's Vic.

467
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,216
Kat.

468
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,096
Coming, Vic?

469
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,186
Okay, gang, let's settle down!

470
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,937
Put a lid on it!

471
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,024
I got a couple of
announcements to make.

472
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:14,281
First. The asbestos removal from the
gym is taking a little longer than planned.

473
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:18,202
So we're gonna have to
push back the Halloween Dance

474
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,912
just by a couple of months.

475
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:28,295
As most of you know, my parents have
finished the new boathouse.

476
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:32,299
So I'm sure it'd be no problem
having the party at my place.

477
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,886
Great. That's done.

478
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,388
Secondly, we have
a new student today.

479
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,767
I'd like you all to
meet Harvey Kathleen.

480
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:48,148
Would you like to come up
and say hi to everyone for me?

481
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:08,502
Why don't you tell us something special
about yourself, Kathleen?

482
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,003
It's Kat.

483
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,262
I guess I just moved here
with my dad from Santa Fe

484
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,430
and Friendship seems like

485
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:23,684
a pretty friendly place.

486
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,897
So where are you guys living?

487
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,607
In outer space?

488
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,820
No. Whipstaff.

489
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,701
You've heard of it.

490
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,203
You actually live there?

491
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,871
Yeah, I mean...

492
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:49,042
I know it looks kind of funky and stuf
from the outside and everything

493
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:53,213
but, I mean... I don't know,
inside it's kind of cool.

494
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,049
Yeah, if you drink blood.

495
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:01,596
Mr. Curtis, check this.We're dead for
the Halloween Dance, right?

496
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:05,767
This girl has a seriously creepy house
with room to spare.

497
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,397
Wait a minute. I thought we were having
the party at my place.

498
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,400
Okay, we'll take a vote.

499
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:17,029
Whoever wants the party
at my house, raise your hand.

500
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,157
Whipstaff?

501
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,751
"Johns Hopkins University."
Very impressive.

502
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,294
- Very.
- Pull!

503
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,430
Not this one.

504
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,891
Thank you, gentlemen.

505
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,225
What a dish, Doc.

506
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,436
The little missus, perhaps?

507
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,149
Fatso, you animal!
Is she available, Doc?

508
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,985
She's my wife, Amelia.
She's deceased.

509
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,070
Even better.

510
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:01,406
But we're not here
to talk about me.

511
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:04,284
See? Now don't you
feel just awful?

512
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,619
I was just goofing.

513
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,579
Don't be goofing on Amelia.

514
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:12,834
She's as nice a person as they come.
She's always treated you right, Stinkie.

515
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,171
I got no complaints. She's always
been an angel to me.

516
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,132
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

517
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:23,303
I'm saying she's
a peach. None better. Why?

518
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,305
You've actually seen her?

519
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,640
What, you think I'm blind?

520
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,309
Of course, I've seen her.
Who hasn't?

521
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,521
What, you're not looking
for her, are you, Doc?

522
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,441
That's not really the focus
of our sessions here, is it?

523
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:39,277
But as long as you
raise the issue

524
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:45,617
you wouldn't have a way of contacting
others like yourselves

525
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,786
would you?

526
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,206
I didn't think so.

527
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,793
Now that's not generally
allowed there, Doc.

528
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,088
I mean, you got to
go through channels.

529
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,423
Yeah, paperwork.

530
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:03,135
Red tape. A holy mess,
you know what I'm saying?

531
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:07,681
But for you, I don't know, maybe we
could work something out.

532
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,685
You keep that ghoul Crittenden
off our backs

533
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,897
and I'd say we got a deal.
Right, boys?

534
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,526
Deal?

535
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,986
Deal.

536
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,030
Fatso, you know
where Amelia floats. Go.

537
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,076
It's that easy, huh?

538
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,162
We got a ghost-to-ghost
network.

539
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,663
We share haunting stories.

540
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,039
We throw parties.

541
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,876
The parties are always
pretty dead, though.

542
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:37,901
SharePirate.Com Subs

543
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,048
That was fast.

544
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,265
I think it's for you, Doc.

545
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,858
Go.

546
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,344
Amelia?

547
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,932
My man!

548
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,655
What are you doing...
I mean, hi.

549
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,950
Can I come in?

550
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,496
No. It's so much

551
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:58,333
nicer out here in the flesh...
Fresh air.

552
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,587
So did you ask your dad
about the party?

553
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,382
Yeah.

554
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:10,136
He kind of hit the ceiling, but I think
it's gonna be okay.

555
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,639
Cool. So listen

556
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:16,810
if you're not hooked up with anybody
else, you wanna... I don't know

557
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,813
you wanna hang out
with me at the party?

558
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,941
I'd love to.

559
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,651
All right. Cool.

560
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,028
All right, see you.

561
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,154
Okay.

562
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,796
Did you ask her? Yeah.

563
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,382
And she actually believed you.

564
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,093
This really bites.

565
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:53,054
No, it's absolutely perfect.

566
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,362
See? I'm a good dancer.

567
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,913
I don't need a costume.

568
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,044
I'm always
the life of the party.

569
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,172
Casper! Listen,
I know you want to go.

570
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,674
Come on, we'd have
a great time together.

571
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,760
Casper, I have a date.

572
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,721
What's this Vic guy
got that I don't?

573
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,181
A pulse.

574
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,350
Big fleshy deal.

575
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,352
A tan.

576
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,228
Very bad for your skin.

577
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,857
How about a reflection?

578
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,406
Okay, but can he do this?

579
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,454
Come with me
if you want to live.

580
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,584
Casper, no. Don't!

581
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,221
Casper, no. Oh, my God.
High, this is very high!

582
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,057
Casper!

583
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,697
Casper, this is beautiful.

584
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,949
I come here every night.

585
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,575
Alone?

586
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:43,957
What were you like
when you were alive?

587
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,710
I was...

588
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,881
I don't remember.

589
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,720
You don't remember anything
from your life?

590
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,263
No.

591
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,140
So, nothing?

592
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,895
You don't remember
what school you went to?

593
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,149
How old you were?
Your favorite song?

594
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,569
What about your dad?

595
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,158
Not even your mom?

596
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,660
Is that bad?

597
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:24,622
No. It's just kind of sad.

598
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,509
I wonder why you don't
remember anything.

599
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,432
Guess 'cause
when you're a ghost

600
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,852
life doesn't matter
that much anymore.

601
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,687
So you forget.

602
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:52,817
Sometimes I worry
that I'm starting to forget.

603
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,570
Forget what?

604
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,113
My mom.

605
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,658
Just certain things.

606
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:05,205
The sound of her
making breakfast downstairs.

607
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,959
The way she put on
her lipstick, so carefully.

608
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,714
I do remember.

609
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,717
She always used Ivory soap.

610
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:22,514
And when she'd hug me,
I'd breathe her in so deep

611
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,352
and I remember,
before I'd go to sleep

612
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,313
she'd whisper in my ear,

613
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:34,192
"Stardust in the eyes,
rosy cheeks,

614
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,195
"and a happy girl
in the morning."

615
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,750
If my mom's a ghost,
did she forget about me?

616
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:55,004
No. She'd never forget you.

617
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,096
If I were alive

618
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,016
would you go to
the Halloween Dance with me?

619
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,106
Can I keep you?

620
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,948
Casper, close the window.
It's cold.

621
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,142
Hey, Dad.

622
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,395
I found your Visa card.

623
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,730
Where was it?

624
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,066
In your wallet.
I was thinking,
maybe I could use it

625
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,819
to buy this perfect costume
I saw in a store downtown.

626
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,321
You always made your costume.

627
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:02,989
No, Mom did.

628
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,869
I think I could come up
with something pretty good.

629
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:12,707
Why don't we just roll you
in aluminum foil and you
could go as a leftover?

630
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,964
Don't worry.
You always look cute.

631
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:23,301
I don't wanna look cute.
Cute's like when you're
nine years old

632
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,512
and you've got papier-mâché
around your head.

633
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,723
I wanna look

634
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,726
nice.

635
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,481
Like date nice.

636
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,318
Really?

637
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:48,493
Honey, you know,
I think maybe it's time
that we sat down...

638
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,870
It's a little late
for that, Dad.

639
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,205
How late?

640
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,626
Don't worry, not that late.

641
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,086
Good.

642
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:04,050
You know that I would
love to buy you
everything that you wanted

643
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:08,388
but until Miss Crittenden
pays me, that thing is
pretty worthless.

644
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,183
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

645
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,436
I'm sure I can come up
with something perfect
for the party.

646
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,023
It's my party,
and I'll die if I want to

647
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:20,942
Die if I want to

648
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,279
Dad, please.

649
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:28,574
Whatever you do,
don't let those guys crash it.

650
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:34,163
I think they're actually
getting to be quite
focused now.

651
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:40,294
You will die, too,
when it happens to you

652
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,049
Big finish.

653
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,261
Scream or sugar?

654
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,886
The patient has
finally arrived.

655
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,596
Late again, I see.

656
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,808
Could this be an expression
of hostility, Doc?

657
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,645
It's your hour, Freud.

658
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:28,027
What, so silent?
No pearls of wisdom today,
Doc?

659
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,031
Come on, Doc.
Stay tough, don't stop.

660
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,703
Come on, Doc,
hang with us homeboys.
Wait a second.

661
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,749
What? You ain't thinking
about packing it in now,
are you, Doc?

662
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,584
We're just
starting to have fun.

663
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,171
It ain't often we meet
a bonebag as amusing as you.

664
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,716
Boys, this is serious.

665
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:54,262
I think the doc is having
one of them fleshy breakdowns.

666
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,847
Time for drastic measures.

667
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,306
You think
we should sing a song?

668
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:01,727
No. I think it's time
we gave the doc
our own prescription.

669
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:03,020
But what about the party?

670
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,981
The party'll have to wait.

671
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,400
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

672
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,568
Gentlemen.

673
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,778
Happy hour. Happy hour.

674
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:17,910
Ninety-nine
bottles of beer on the wall
Ninety-nine bottles of beer

675
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,620
Here's to dead guys!

676
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,290
This is an outrage.
This is appalling.

677
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:25,543
You pay a man to get ghosts
out of the house
and what does he do?

678
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,086
He gets the ghosts
out of the house.

679
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,754
Exactly.

680
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,935
It's about time.

681
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,281
Look familiar?

682
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,171
I know this!

683
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:19,305
I had five fingers. I remember.

684
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,683
Hootie!

685
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,191
And wait!

686
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:39,992
Check it out.

687
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,036
Hands up, Kat!

688
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:54,340
It was my mom's.

689
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:57,969
Can I?

690
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,178
Go ahead.

691
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:16,821
It's perfect.
Do you think I could
wear it to the party tonight?

692
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,074
Casper?

693
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,209
I begged and begged my dad
to get me this sled.

694
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,880
He acted like I couldn't even
have it 'cause I didn't know
how to ride it.

695
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:40,678
Then one morning I came down
for breakfast and there
it was, just for me.

696
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,930
For no reason at all.

697
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,685
I took it out and went
sledding all day.

698
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:53,441
My dad said that's enough but
I couldn't stop.
I was having so much fun.

699
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:57,570
Then it got late, it got dark.

700
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,406
It got cold

701
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,784
and I got sick.

702
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,412
My dad got sad.

703
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,921
What's it like to die?

704
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,259
Like being born.

705
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,262
Only backwards.

706
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:27,767
I remember, I didn't go
where I was supposed to go.

707
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,853
I just stayed behind

708
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,272
so my dad wouldn't be lonely.

709
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:48,954
Is that your dad?

710
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:57,213
"McFadden claimed that
he was haunted by
the ghost of his dead son

711
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:00,383
"and that he invented
a machine to bring him
back to life...

712
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,967
"The Lazarus."

713
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,147
Sorry. I guess we'll have
to take the long way.

714
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,650
Hurry up! Come on!

715
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,988
My dad hid it
so no one could find it.

716
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,991
But I remember where it is!
Wait till you see it.

717
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,255
Don't you know a shortcut?

718
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:40,840
You got it.

719
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,009
Casper, no.

720
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,971
Wall! Human! Stop!

721
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,438
Hey, over here.

722
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,524
Go ahead. Sit down.

723
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,528
I would hold on.

724
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,530
Why?

725
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,545
Casper!

726
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,390
Well?

727
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,392
What was that?

728
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,227
The "Up and At 'Em Machine."

729
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,145
My dad was a great inventor

730
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:02,481
but he had trouble
getting going in the morning.

731
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:05,067
Didn't he ever
hear of caffeine?

732
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:26,839
What is all this?

733
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:28,549
My dad's lab.

734
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,175
Kind of a slob, wasn't he?

735
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,846
Here, he could do
whatever he wanted to.
No matter how busy he was

736
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:36,765
he would drop everything
to play pirates with me.

737
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,976
Man, we had so much fun!

738
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,104
Aye, matey.
Buccaneers and buried gold.

739
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,607
Whipstaff doth a treasure hold.

740
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:46,859
Come on.

741
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,615
So where's this Lazarus thing?

742
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,283
You're looking at it.

743
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:55,701
Down there?

744
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,953
That's useful.

745
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:00,039
I know there's a way
to get it going.

746
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:03,208
I just can't... What about that?

747
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,293
That?

748
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,378
That's the vault.

749
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,842
Wait! It's got to be this!

750
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,702
Hey, I did it!

751
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,974
Lazarus.

752
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,339
What is this? Careful!

753
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:16,842
That's what makes
the whole thing work.

754
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,720
Kind of an instant
primordial soup mix.

755
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,515
It's what brings
ghosts back to life.

756
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,393
Just enough for one.

757
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,700
Pull the lever.

758
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:42,951
Which one?

759
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,995
I don't know. Try one.

760
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:57,382
Casper.

761
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,885
I'm gonna be alive.

762
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,397
How am I gonna do this?

763
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:15,609
I couldn't even
get my Easy Bake oven to work.

764
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,440
Casper?

765
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,415
Am I alive?

766
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:17,212
Do you have any idea
what this means?

767
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:18,463
Yes!

768
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,257
No.

769
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,843
You don't have
to be scared of death anymore.

770
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,721
One minute you're a ghost
next you're back on your feet

771
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,598
free to come and go
as you please.

772
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:31,018
Hell, you could even
fly through...
Walls!

773
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,479
Thick walls.

774
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:36,189
Thick as steel.

775
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,735
Certainly could get
to whatever's
behind those walls.

776
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,904
Like a treasure, for example?

777
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:46,116
Then snap, crackle, pop,
you're back alive and on your
way to the Riviera.

778
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,827
If you were a ghost.

779
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,496
If you were.

780
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,920
Damn it, Dibs.
This won't hurt a bit.

781
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,130
Stop being such a weenie!

782
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,507
It's just business. Come on!

783
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,885
If you would just...

784
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,401
So there you are.

785
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,543
Dibs, you're taking this
way too personally.

786
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:48,845
Wait!

787
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:00,065
Carrigan?

788
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,569
Are you a ghost yet?

789
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,074
Carrigan!

790
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,787
What a tragic waste.

791
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:16,790
She had my favorite sunglasses.

792
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,962
Not so fast, little man.

793
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,589
The bitch is back.

794
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:34,641
Warden threw a party
at the county jail

795
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,686
The prison band was there and
they began to wail

796
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,564
The band was playin' hard
the joint began to swing

797
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,025
You shoulda heard those
knocked out jailbirds sing

798
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,401
Let's rock

799
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:48,488
This Dr. Harvey's got
a lot of spirit, you know
what I'm saying?

800
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:52,117
Yeah, but he's got his
whole miserable life
ahead of him.

801
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:55,829
So we could do him a favor
and put him out of his misery.

802
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,290
Yeah. Good idea.

803
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,293
We've been the ghostly trio
long enough.

804
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:05,464
Time to make it a quartet.

805
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,519
Can I just say something here?

806
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,188
Get a little personal?

807
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,607
Yeah. Why not?

808
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:24,941
Well, you know.

809
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,861
I just got to tell you

810
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,865
you guys remind me of
what it's like

811
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:33,742
to hang out with the boys.

812
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,118
I mean

813
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:39,456
you are absolutely there
for each other.

814
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,334
I mean

815
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,711
you look life
right in the face.

816
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,672
You say, "I'm a ghost.
I don't need you."

817
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,883
You know what?

818
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:53,011
I'm gonna tell that
Miss Critten Picken...

819
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,514
Crichton Critten.

820
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,017
I'm gonna tell that lady

821
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:01,520
you ain't going anywhere.

822
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:04,773
It's your house.
You're haunting it.

823
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,192
Possession is nine-tenths
of the law...

824
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:08,860
No. Yes.

825
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,028
No.

826
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:11,196
Yes.

827
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:17,035
I didn't think so at first
but you guys are great.

828
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:20,872
I love you.

829
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:32,717
No.

830
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,731
What a sweetheart.

831
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:49,276
I can't croak him now.

832
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,946
Me, neither. No way.

833
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,618
All right, boys.

834
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,413
The night is young.

835
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,291
We are going to clean out

836
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,710
every bar this town has got!

837
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:11,047
We're gonna booze it
until we lose it.

838
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,757
Come on.

839
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,940
I think my ears just popped.

840
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,781
Come to mama!

841
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:42,454
My treasure!

842
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,456
You mean my treasure.

843
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,334
Miss Crittenden?

844
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,501
In the flesh.

845
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,503
Well, in a couple of minutes.

846
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:57,552
Dibs! What are you doing?

847
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,054
This is no time to shave!

848
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:01,097
Helping you. Remember?

849
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,474
Remember what?

850
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,184
This!

851
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,645
You stole that.
That's Casper's.

852
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:09,648
So sue me!

853
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,858
Dibs! The capsule, now!

854
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,110
Coming. I'm coming, okay?

855
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,492
Keep away from me!

856
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,208
Here!

857
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,293
Jump in!

858
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,693
Perfect.

859
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:01,032
We're here.

860
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:03,743
Okay.

861
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,662
Hi. Come on in.

862
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,122
This is the room.

863
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:10,875
Stay together, you'll be safe,
and I'll be right back.

864
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,676
Amber, do we have to do this?

865
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,512
She wants a Halloween party.

866
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:25,223
She's gonna get
a Halloween party.

867
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,697
That's my treasure!

868
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:43,575
Stay back! Keep away from me!
Casper.

869
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,494
Don't come near me,
you spiteful spook.

870
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,663
I'll knock you into
the next world!

871
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,749
Come on. Let's go.

872
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:05,930
Hey, Poppin Fresh.
It's my turn in the oven!

873
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:10,310
Dibs! Get this thing cooking,
you flaccid little worm, you!

874
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:17,233
How kind of you to drop in.

875
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:20,653
You know, if there's one thing
I've learned from you

876
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,698
it's always kick them
when they're down.

877
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:26,743
And, baby,
you're six feet under.

878
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,120
Oh, what a shame.

879
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,166
Sorry, sweetheart.

880
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:34,959
We're through.

881
01:18:35,086 --> 01:18:38,797
I am not gonna forget this,
you ungrateful lousy
little worm, you!

882
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:42,175
You can haunt me all you want

883
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:45,929
but it's gonna be
in a great, big,
expensive house

884
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:50,809
with lovely purple wallpaper
and great big green carpets.

885
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,978
And a little dog
called Carrigan.

886
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,023
A bitch, just like you!

887
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:00,318
I got the power!
I got the treasure!

888
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,487
And you have a flight to catch.

889
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,160
Any other takers?

890
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,705
No. But aren't you
forgetting something?

891
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:13,998
What?

892
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,918
Your unfinished business.

893
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,670
My what?

894
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:22,215
You know unfinished business.

895
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,968
All ghosts have
unfinished business.

896
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,845
That's why
they don't cross over.

897
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:30,890
Unfinished business?
I have no unfinished business.

898
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,184
I have my treasure, my mansion.

899
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,061
I have everything!

900
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,230
I'm just perfect!

901
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:41,985
Wait, I lied!

902
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,821
I have unfinished business.
Lots of unfinished business.

903
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,323
I'm not ready to
cross over yet!

904
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:50,702
Wait! You tricked me,
you rotten little brats!

905
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,370
No!

906
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:14,517
My treasure!

907
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:17,187
A ball? That's your treasure?

908
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:19,189
Are you kidding?

909
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:22,150
It's autographed by
Duke Snider
of the Brooklyn Dodgers.

910
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,860
My favorite player.

911
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:25,862
Casper

912
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,739
it's time.

913
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:36,623
Honey, I'm home!

914
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:44,464
Dad?

915
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,759
No. What have you done to him?

916
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:50,553
Nothing.
He's just a little dead.

917
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:51,930
I'm free!

918
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,973
I've never felt so good
in my life!

919
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:56,267
I can fly!

920
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:58,853
Rookie.

921
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:00,271
Stinkie, work with him.

922
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:02,941
Dad?

923
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:05,568
Who's the girl?

924
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:08,154
Dad, it's me. It's Kat!

925
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:09,948
Kat?

926
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:12,325
Kat Ballou?

927
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,409
Katatonic?

928
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:14,702
Katastrophic?

929
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,120
Kreplach soup?

930
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:23,962
Flash flood alert.

931
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,383
Don't you remember?

932
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,556
Yeah, I remember!

933
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,521
No, this.

934
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,863
Kat.

935
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,158
Sweetheart.

936
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,036
What have I done?

937
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:00,164
Kat, don't cry.

938
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,667
Please.

939
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:06,879
Come on, Dr. Harvey.
You need this more than I do.

940
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,843
Casper.

941
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,887
This is the way it's got to be.

942
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,126
Dad?

943
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:57,096
Honey.

944
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,559
It felt like
the strangest dream.

945
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,233
I thought we almost
lost each other
for a minute there.

946
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,073
Oh, bucket.

947
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:24,082
Your party started without you.

948
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,587
Your date's probably waiting.

949
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,423
Maybe we should get going.

950
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:39,180
Where are we?

951
01:23:58,158 --> 01:23:59,784
Well, go ahead.

952
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,160
What about you?

953
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:04,622
This is your party.
Go do your thing.

954
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:08,126
Go hang or chill

955
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,503
or kick it,
or whatever you call it.

956
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:15,174
I think you got a date
out there.

957
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:16,509
Thanks, Dad.

958
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,517
I hope no one saw that.

959
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,153
Hold still.

960
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,946
I'm trying.
Could you weigh any more?

961
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,323
Just shut up
and get your head down.

962
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:44,662
You got to see this.

963
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:47,498
People are gonna freak.

964
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,041
Let me see.

965
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,087
Cool.

966
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:54,589
Thank you.

967
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:13,668
You're... That's right.

968
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,462
Kat's mom?

969
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,340
Are you an angel?

970
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:24,262
That was a very noble thing
you did tonight, Casper.

971
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,973
I know Kat
will never forget it.

972
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:29,016
She needs her father.

973
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:32,478
And I know yours
will never forget it either.

974
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,481
You've fulfilled his
greatest dream, Casper

975
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:38,526
and I know
he is very proud of you.

976
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:41,320
And for what you've done

977
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:44,240
I'm giving you
your dream in return.

978
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:47,493
But it's just for tonight.

979
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,705
Sort of a Cinderella deal.

980
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,665
So I have until midnight?

981
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:53,916
Ten.

982
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:56,752
Hey! Cinderella
got until midnight.

983
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,089
Cinderella wasn't 12 years old.

984
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:53,202
I told you I was a good dancer.

985
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,122
Can I keep you?

986
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,752
Casper?

987
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:45,838
Hello, James.

988
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,218
Amelia.

989
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:54,722
It's all right.

990
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,768
It's just me.

991
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:07,902
I thought I'd have
a hundred things
to say when I...

992
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:12,198
How?

993
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:17,536
Let's just say you know
three crazy ghosts
who kept their word.

994
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:23,459
James, I know
you've been
searching for me.

995
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:26,670
But there's something
you have to understand.

996
01:30:26,797 --> 01:30:29,757
You and Kat loved me
so well when I was alive

997
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,176
that I have no
unfinished business.

998
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:34,845
Please don't let me be yours.

999
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:36,680
But, Amelia

1000
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:40,976
I don't...

1001
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,605
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

1002
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:48,150
What parent does?

1003
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:53,280
James, Kat is growing up
beautifully because of you.

1004
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,326
No wonder I miss you so much.

1005
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:02,081
Just a couple of things,
though.

1006
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:06,127
Don't pick up the extension
every time she gets
a phone call.

1007
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:09,588
French fries are not
a breakfast food.

1008
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:13,134
And don't ask her
to wear a T-shirt under...

1009
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:15,261
Under her bathing suit.

1010
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:17,471
I know.

1011
01:31:18,265 --> 01:31:21,183
Our daughter is a teenager.
A teenager.

1012
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,003
Wait.

1013
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:52,298
Where are you going?

1014
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:57,386
Where I can watch over
both of you
until we're together again.

1015
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:03,267
Good-bye, James.

1016
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:26,582
Casper?

1017
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:47,603
Boo?

1018
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,959
Not bad for my first party,
huh?

1019
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,586
Couldn't have been better.

1020
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,255
It ain't over yet.

1021
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:15,547
Boys?

1022
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:24,682
Casper the friendly ghost

1023
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,059
The friendliest ghost you know

1024
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:30,271
Though grown-ups
might look at him in fright

1025
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:32,773
The children all love him so

1026
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,277
Casper the friendly ghost

1027
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:38,696
He couldn't be bad or mean

1028
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:42,032
You know, he jump and play
Sing and dance all day

1029
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:44,910
The friendliest ghost
you've ever seen

1030
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,955
He always say "Hello"

1031
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:50,708
And he's really glad to meet ya

1032
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:53,294
Wherever he may go

1033
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:57,339
You know, he's kind to
every living creature

1034
01:33:57,424 --> 01:33:59,633
Grown-ups don't understand

1035
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:02,177
Why children
all love him the most

1036
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,639
But kids all know
that he loves them so

1037
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:08,142
Casper the friendly ghost

1038
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:22,197
Casper, your friendly
Your friendly

1039
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:37,338
He always say "Hello"

1040
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,341
He's always glad to meet ya

1041
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:43,093
Wherever he may go

1042
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:47,014
He's kind to
every living creature

1043
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,308
Grown-ups don't understand

1044
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:51,935
Why children
all love him the most

1045
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:55,481
But kids all know
he loves them so

1046
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:58,400
Casper the friendly ghost
