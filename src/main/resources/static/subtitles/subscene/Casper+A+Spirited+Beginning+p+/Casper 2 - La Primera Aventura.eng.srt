1
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:32,042
Oh, dude!

2
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:34,333
This isn't happening.

3
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,144
This is not happening.

4
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:46,810
I thought people only flew in dreams.

5
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:49,847
That's it. I'm having a nightmare.

6
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:53,635
Wake up, Casper. Come on, snap out of it.

7
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:58,737
Hey, mister. What's goin' on?

8
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,979
- What happened to me?
- Scram, deadbeat!

9
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:05,914
- I'm in a grave mood.
- What's his problem?

10
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:11,254
- Where's this train goin', lady?
- The processing station.

11
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:14,288
Now let me rest in peace.

12
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,492
Excuse me, but where am I?

13
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,988
That's simple, fog boy. Too close to me.

14
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:26,829
- Let me go.
- Later, dude.

15
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,657
What are you trying to do? Kill me?

16
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,407
No, wait! Look out! You're gonna hit the...

17
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:41,187
How'd they do that?

18
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:46,553
"Welcome to Deedstown."

19
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:51,500
This looks like a quiet place.
I hope someone here can help me.

20
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,924
Pardon me, sir. I'm new here and...

21
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,228
Well, welcome to Deedstown, sonny.

22
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,298
A ghost!

23
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:14,355
- A ghost!
- A ghost? Where?

24
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:17,794
He must be seein' things.

25
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,356
What's goin' on?

26
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,008
G-g-ghost!

27
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,597
What's goin' on? Wait. Come back.
Tell me what's happening.

28
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:36,726
What's everybody goin' crazy for?

29
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,253
Drive!

30
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,611
I don't see any ghost.

31
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,846
Me? I'm no ghost.

32
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:05,866
My feet! I am a ghost!

33
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,974
No!

34
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:26,654
This is Captain Carson speaking.
The uniform of the day is...

35
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,747
The X-Files T-shirt!

36
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,437
Dad's breakfast!

37
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:43,869
- T minus four minutes and counting.
- I know! I know!

38
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,518
- Dad, when did you go to bed?
- Early. 2am.

39
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:47,570
Dad!

40
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,461
I was working on these sketches.
What do you think?

41
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,526
Nice, if you live on Zeta Alpha 5.

42
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:57,976
Just what this town needs - fresh blood!

43
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,926
Out with the old, in with the new.

44
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,830
No! In with the food! Eat!

45
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,180
Chris.

46
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:13,333
- I'm on a diet.
- Fine. More for me.

47
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:17,628
Don't forget. Tonight's my open house
at school. I want you to see my poster.

48
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:19,930
After I tear down the old Applegate place.

49
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,616
- Not the mansion.
- Don't start.

50
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:26,711
It's the first phase of my renovation
of the town, and the mayor loves it.

51
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:30,109
But I like that old mansion. It's really spooky.

52
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:32,760
No more supernatural stuff. I'll see you later.

53
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:37,020
Don't forget. Tonight's my open house.
Parents are manda...

54
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:40,244
tory.

55
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,020
OK, to the left, Stan!

56
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:54,614
Make room here.

57
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:58,166
Wide load. Give us some room.

58
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:09,051
Stop the demolition.
You don't have our permission.

59
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:12,180
Stop the demolition.
You don't have our permission.

60
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:25,211
Save Applegate Mansion.

61
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:35,188
Save Applegate Mansion.
You don't have our permission.

62
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,847
Stop the demolition.

63
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:42,171
Hold it right there, buddy! That's far enough.

64
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:46,232
We won't trade our landmarks
for crass, commercial eyesores.

65
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:52,148
No, we won't.

66
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:54,644
No more burger stands.

67
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:58,043
Wait till Carson gets here.

68
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:15,026
Please, ladies and gentlemen.
I have an announcement to make.

69
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,271
Just listen to me for one second.

70
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:21,564
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not the enemy.

71
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:28,025
We are here to improve our town. We're doing
that by giving you a brand-new mini-mall.

72
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:30,962
- We don't need a new mini-mall!
- Please.

73
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:35,477
The first thing we've got to do
is tear down this dilapidated wreck.

74
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:40,988
This house survived the decades
and we'll make sure it survives you.

75
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:45,918
Look, lady, cut me some slack.
This place is fallin' apart.

76
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,567
The best thing is to replace it
with something useful.

77
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,776
Like what? Another burger stand?

78
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,172
Not another burger stand!
Stop the building, we demand!

79
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,977
Not another burger stand!
Stop the building, we demand!

80
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:04,057
Ladies and gentlemen,
whether you like it or not,

81
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:07,474
in about two seconds this place
is gonna become kindling wood.

82
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,917
My apologies. Stan, level this puppy.

83
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:16,349
Quick! The human wall!

84
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:26,611
I'm calling the sheriff.

85
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:41,977
Bull... Doz... Er.

86
00:10:43,905 --> 00:10:46,837
Bull... Doz... Er.

87
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,870
Bull... Doz... Er.

88
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:02,936
Don't ya get it, bone bag?

89
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,372
Bull... Doz... Er.

90
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:07,864
No!

91
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:09,243
Bulldozer!

92
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:32,666
Gangway, fleshies! Let him through.

93
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:36,534
Where are they?

94
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:41,556
Run for your lives!

95
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,850
Missed me. Missed me, skinnard.

96
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:51,610
He's down for the count.

97
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:58,364
Fleshie, you're mine,
cos possession is nine tenths of the law!

98
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:04,886
Get away from me!

99
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,291
You hate me. You really hate me!

100
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,045
Simon says shake your body!

101
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,259
Oh, medic! We got a fleshie down!

102
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:22,172
Coming, Doctor.
I learned this trick from my mummy.

103
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,524
It's a poltergeist party!

104
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:36,147
I know we're not in Technicolor,
so how about odorama?

105
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:44,694
Move it, pal. This is a no-parking zone.

106
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,266
See what happens
when you don't set your alarm?

107
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,604
Well, at least you have a sunroof now.

108
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,549
Before you run off, pal,
you'd better check under there.

109
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:05,883
- Under where?
- Exactly.

110
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:09,145
- A mega-wedgie!
- What a crackup!

111
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,823
My allergy.

112
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,981
I said you were eating too much dairy.

113
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:28,381
Ghosts three, fleshies nothin'.

114
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,412
I love my job.

115
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:34,519
Boys, the world is our oyster.

116
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,656
- Our playground.
- Our love is here to stay.

117
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:42,172
Thank you. OK, everybody.
Sheriff's on his way...

118
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:46,171
Wow.

119
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,409
He sure works fast.

120
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,798
Hey, Brock.

121
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:58,967
Don't ever smack me, bug.

122
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,074
But look - creepy Chris Carson.

123
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,276
I hear he keeps spiders as pets.

124
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,547
Yeah. Probably eats 'em too.

125
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:10,003
Let's pay him a friendly visit.

126
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,021
So, you off to another weirdo convention?

127
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:22,102
Drop dead, Brock.

128
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,478
Check it out. Chris is readin' about himself.

129
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:32,722
- You guys really need new material.
- Shut up, geek, or I'll pulverize you.

130
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,125
"Pulverize"? Wow, Brock!
A three-syllable word.

131
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:39,865
Why on earth did Principal Rabie
hold you back a grade?

132
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:45,624
I'm gonna love takin' you out, wacko.

133
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:04,535
Definitely the work of the ghostly trio.
This, I've gotta see.

134
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:09,209
- Dave, it's Tim. Where's my crew?
- They quit.

135
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,251
Adios! Reservoir!

136
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,564
Dave, I need this house down.

137
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:17,940
You got two options, Tim. Find another outfit,
or start huffin' and puffin'.

138
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,883
Look, you're the last demolition crew in town.

139
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:24,218
If Mayor Hunt is not posing
in front of some rubble today, I'm dead!

140
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,832
Tough! We don't do ghosts - union rules.

141
00:15:27,904 --> 00:15:30,269
Dave, there are no such things as ghosts!

142
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,484
Dave?

143
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:40,090
Man, are we good or what?

144
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:44,214
Yeah. Just like the US scare force!

145
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,863
Fatso, lighten up, huh?

146
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:51,032
- I mean, go turn on the lights.
- Yeah, I knew that.

147
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:54,035
Did we ever spook them bone bags!

148
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:57,754
Yeah. They didn't even stand
a ghost of a chance!

149
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:01,398
Boy, them fleshies sure can run!

150
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:04,348
I'll say. Maybe they take extra vitamin E.

151
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,607
Well, maybe we're just the best.

152
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:09,911
You sure are. Say cheese!

153
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:11,988
- Where?
- Cheese!

154
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:17,403
We'll take three eight by tens.

155
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,691
It's that snoop again.

156
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,238
The mummy wrap was a nice touch, guys.

157
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:28,953
But the wedgie? It seemed
a bit overused, don't you think?

158
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,794
Who asked you, nosy?

159
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,804
- Nice try.
- Ooh, it's Mr Scare-Me-Not.

160
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,197
Look, kid. How many times we gotta tell ya?

161
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:52,018
This is an exclusive club,
and you ain't invited.

162
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:54,741
Hey, what's that?

163
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,430
Aha! This is a condemned building.

164
00:16:57,794 --> 00:17:02,014
According to the Ectoplasma Britannica,
it's a public place.

165
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,748
Fleshies ain't supposed to have this.
Where'd you get it?

166
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,940
The Spooker lmage Catalog. So how come
you guys decided to move here?

167
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:18,865
This ain't our home.
Though it is a nice location.

168
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:22,389
Oh, yes. Excellent view too.
Something of a fixer-upper though.

169
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:25,560
Will you two shut your yaps?

170
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,689
Come on, guys. I know a lot about ghosts.

171
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,895
Let me hang with ya.

172
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:36,220
Hang? You're a little late for that event, kid.

173
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:41,336
Besides, us? Pals with a bone bag?
Don't make me laugh.

174
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,638
Don't make me puke.

175
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:46,710
Don't eat beans around the campfire.

176
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,289
Come on, guys.

177
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:57,750
Beat it, biped. You don't scare right.

178
00:17:58,689 --> 00:18:00,792
Ghosts. What do they know?

179
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:03,901
Oh, my gosh, I'm late for school.

180
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:40,919
Here they come!

181
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,708
All right, everybody. Settle down, folks.

182
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:04,692
I'm Snivel, and welcome
to our ghost train station.

183
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,173
In other words, the station
where we train you to be ghosts. Get it?

184
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:14,552
OK. Over the next few weeks,

185
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:19,063
you the rookies will be learning
the A, Boo, Cs of the ghost life.

186
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:25,848
OK again. At which time,
you will be issued a haunting license.

187
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:30,903
All right, now. You deadbeats,
file through here! Ready, march!

188
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:35,794
All right, everybody, come on. What are you
looking at? I am Snivel. Keep on movin'.

189
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:39,413
March, march, march.
You didn't laugh at my jokes.

190
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:43,065
And the grand total is... five.

191
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:47,316
Oh, no! Who's missing?

192
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,005
Casper?

193
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:54,131
Did you say "missing," you little runt?

194
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,181
Kibosh...

195
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:03,127
I'm in charge here and nobody skips training.

196
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:06,710
Especially little snotnoses named Carter.

197
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:10,196
That's Casper, sir.

198
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:11,350
Silence!

199
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:14,521
When I want your help, I'll beat it out of you.

200
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,655
Of course, O mellow one.

201
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:20,244
- Now, about this Castor...
- Casper.

202
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:22,261
Sorry.

203
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:25,660
How would it look if I, the mighty Kibosh,

204
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:29,652
let some wide-eyed rookie run loose
without any schooling?

205
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:32,854
- Very embarrassing, sir.
- Embarrassing?

206
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,065
It's disgraceful.

207
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,901
Almost as bad as losing track
of those three worm-headed deserters.

208
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:44,219
- What were their names?
- Stinky, Stretch and Fatso, sir.

209
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:47,001
When I find those slackers,

210
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:50,396
I'll tie a sheepshank on their bedsheet butts.

211
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:54,871
- Your blood pressure, O stupendous one.
- I have no blood!

212
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:58,006
Now, find me this Casper

213
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:03,673
and bring his sorry, hooky-playing tush
back here immediately!

214
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:05,464
I'm outta here.

215
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,630
- Hi!
- Oh, hello.

216
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:13,555
Excuse me, ma'am. Can you help me, please?

217
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:16,052
Well, of course, but where are you?

218
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:19,420
I'm over here. Just don't be scared, OK?

219
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,999
Gracious me. Who would
be scared of a little boy...

220
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:26,452
G... g... ghost!

221
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,301
No! Help me!

222
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,092
I wish someone would just talk to me.

223
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:41,911
This reminds me, I gotta see my dentist.

224
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:46,172
Tim, the news is here to record my glorious
speech in front of a flattened house.

225
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,377
- And it isn't.
- I know, Mr Mayor. It's nuts.

226
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,793
One second my crew was raring to go,
then they're hollering "Ghost."

227
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:53,078
Ghosts?

228
00:21:53,503 --> 00:21:56,981
No, he's justjokin' around.
He's a kidder, you know.

229
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:00,733
Tim, ghost rumors have been around
for the past month.

230
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:06,296
Yes, Mr Mayor, but most of them are
prank calls. They're kids, drunks, nut cases...

231
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:08,373
My wife?

232
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:10,933
And charming, intelligent women.

233
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,826
My wife is very intelligent. It takes her
an hour and a half to watch 60 Minutes,

234
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:20,441
I have enough trouble keeping people from
leaving this sad town, so ixnay on the ghosts.

235
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:22,332
Yes, sir. Sorry about that.

236
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,806
- Mr Mayor? We're almost ready for you.
- I'm cool. Everything is cool.

237
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:32,986
You get that beat-up piece of lumber down
by tomorrow or you're finished.

238
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,999
Hey, Chris. Listen.

239
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:55,861
Sorry about this morning, you know.
Guess I missed breakfast or somethin'.

240
00:22:55,968 --> 00:22:57,558
Whatever.

241
00:22:57,632 --> 00:23:01,655
You know, I really liked your oral report
about that alien spaceship.

242
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:05,531
- Then why'd you throw chalk at me?
- That was Danny, not me.

243
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:08,727
I mean, I loved your report. Right, Leon?

244
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:11,450
- Yeah!
- Thanks.

245
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,218
Well, you know Miss Fistergraff liked it
better than all of ours put together.

246
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:18,458
Well, I guess I got into it.

247
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,237
You know my favorite part?

248
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:25,850
- When that soldier got slimed by that alien.
- That was digestive bile.

249
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,798
Imagine if that bad boy
dropped on you from the sky.

250
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:39,124
- They got Principal Rabie.
- They're gonna get it.

251
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:46,231
All right! Who's responsible for this?

252
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,302
Well, he was really just sorta standing there.

253
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:53,366
- It was him, Principal Rabie.
- Yeah, I saw it too. It was Chris.

254
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:56,883
- All of you go to my office at once!
- That's not fair.

255
00:23:56,992 --> 00:24:00,404
Excuse me. I'll take care of this one.
He was tardy this morning.

256
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,714
- Very well.
- Thank you, sir.

257
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:07,677
The rest of you, march!

258
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,787
It's OK, Chris. I know you didn't do anything.

259
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:17,269
I know that Brock and his pals have
been picking on you for some time.

260
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:21,751
- Well, no big deal. They're losers.
- But you've gotta stand up for your rights.

261
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:26,043
You can't let people get away with that
nonsense. It's like Applegate Mansion.

262
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:30,961
If we don't stand up for it, they're gonna
tear it down and build some Choke 'n' Puke.

263
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,587
I'm sorry, Chris. I shouldn't drag you
into the middle of my feud with your father.

264
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:43,122
There he is.

265
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,491
As you know, I'm dedicated
to breathing new life into Deedstown.

266
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,353
And what better way than building
the Deedstown shopping gallery.

267
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:54,138
A Dum Dum Donut and a Stop 'n' Spend
aren't gonna save this town, Mayor.

268
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,084
There has been some opposition
to the project.

269
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:59,550
Is that why Applegate Mansion
is still standing?

270
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:04,348
I think our town and building contractor
Tim Carson should answer that one.

271
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:06,906
Hi.

272
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:10,782
TV cameras aren't usually so flattering.

273
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:14,806
Our plan to revitalize the town is to remove
all symbols of our stagnant past.

274
00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:17,114
Those are historical landmarks!

275
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,311
Our first attempt was delayed
by interference from a few...

276
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,650
No ghosts.

277
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:26,773
Right. Militant reactionaries.

278
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,365
- Militant?
- No need to worry though.

279
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:33,180
The Deedstown rejuvenation project
will soon be back on track.

280
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:35,798
That creep. That weasel!

281
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:39,987
- You can count on it.
- Well, buster.

282
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:42,614
I'm gonna have another rally, see?

283
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:46,034
You haven't heard the last
of Sheila Fistergraff!

284
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:05,656
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

285
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:10,523
He didn't scream.

286
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:12,597
You didn't run away.

287
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:15,060
A ghost! Hi! Let me get your picture.

288
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,219
- You mean you're not scared of me?
- Are you kidding? I love ghosts.

289
00:26:19,393 --> 00:26:22,521
Bet it's fun - flying and vanishing!

290
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:26,043
All I know is everybody just
screams at me and runs away.

291
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:29,240
- Sounds pretty lonely.
- You don't know how lonely.

292
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:34,038
Let me guess. You feel like no one's
on your side. No one really cares about you.

293
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:38,234
- And no one really likes you.
- I feel like that every day.

294
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:40,309
We've got a lot in common.

295
00:26:40,385 --> 00:26:42,237
- I'm Chris.
- Casper.

296
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:44,408
- So where do you haunt?
- Haunt?

297
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:47,161
- You know, ghosts haunt places.
- They do?

298
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:50,076
- Of course. Didn't you go to spook school?
- No.

299
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,855
Then I know just who you need to see.
Come on.

300
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,381
All right!

301
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,667
This is my hide-out. Awesome, huh?

302
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:06,162
Yeah. Really creepy.

303
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,263
- So there are other ghosts like me, right?
- They were here this morning.

304
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:13,234
Till they get back
I'll teach you about being scary.

305
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:15,798
But I don't feel like scaring people.

306
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:18,487
It's yourjob. It says so in here.

307
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:20,956
OK, then. I guess I'll try.

308
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:24,633
Good. Now, this is how
most people would think of ghosts.

309
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,474
What? That they're blind?

310
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:31,257
Just be one with the sheet for a minute.

311
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:36,179
Let your ghostly instincts guide you,
young Spookwalker.

312
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,831
OK. I'll try. Here goes.

313
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:46,166
Can't we cut some eyeholes in this?

314
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:54,878
Oh, man. This is stupid, Chris.

315
00:27:54,976 --> 00:27:58,715
- Try to be scary by standing still.
- All right. I'll try.

316
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:02,259
Louder.

317
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,372
Scarier.

318
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:13,399
This kid has serious problems.

319
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,216
Now he's dressing up his friends like us.

320
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,324
- He's pathetic.
- Even by fleshie standards.

321
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,579
You guys are just in time.
I could use your help.

322
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:27,453
- What's goin' on? Who's out there?
- It's the ghostly trio.

323
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:32,306
We know who we are. Who's this?
The phantom of the white sale?

324
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,901
- He's the new ghost in town.
- No way!

325
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:38,555
He is, honest. Say hi to Casper.

326
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:41,756
Hello.

327
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:46,774
He's one of us!
Well, shrieking and salutations, Casper.

328
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:50,425
I'm Stretch, and this here's my brother Stinky.

329
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,623
- Ask him how he got his name.
- How'd you get your...

330
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:57,108
How should I know?

331
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:01,556
I stink, therefore I am.

332
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:08,825
And this entire fog bank over here
is a weather front named Fatso.

333
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:11,414
I'm not really fat, just big-boned.

334
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,386
So you guys can teach me
how to change shapes and stuff?

335
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:19,317
What's the matter, kid? Didn't they
teach you nothin' at the trainin' center?

336
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,935
- He never went.
- Every ghost goes through training.

337
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,012
Huddle!

338
00:29:25,953 --> 00:29:28,797
Boys, this is a golden opportunity.

339
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:33,498
That kid is genuine raw material,
unspoiled by Kibosh.

340
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:42,611
Casper and the trio.

341
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,896
Yeah. Here's a chance to prove
our techniques are better than his.

342
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,329
Then maybe he'll stop huntin' for us.

343
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:55,316
OK, Casper. You're part of
the scream team now.

344
00:29:55,424 --> 00:29:59,676
Yeah, and we're gonna teach you
all our tricks and treats of the trade.

345
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:03,515
- I'll work really hard, honest.
- That's the spirit, spirit.

346
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:07,547
Wait till Kibosh hears about this.

347
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:11,160
Major Brownie points for the sniveler!

348
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,101
The first thing you gotta learn
is how to go into stealth mode.

349
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:21,053
Yeah, you're way too conspicuous otherwise.

350
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:24,661
I gotta learn how to do this.

351
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:28,377
Just clear your mind. Think clear thoughts.

352
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:30,616
- Like wind.
- Or gas.

353
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,124
Gas? Wasn't me.

354
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,530
OK.

355
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:42,366
Way to go, Casper! High-five, bud!

356
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,303
No, over here. Higher.

357
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,741
Gotcha! This is so cool.

358
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,740
And that's just the beginning, short sheet.

359
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,008
But air-suckers aren't allowed for the rest.

360
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:56,281
Sorry. Union rules.

361
00:30:56,993 --> 00:30:59,707
Well, I've got important stuff
of my own to do.

362
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,710
All right!

363
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,385
Thanks, Chris. See you later.

364
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:10,039
- So what's first, guys?
- Flying.

365
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:13,428
- But I only know how to hover.
- Just give us your hands.

366
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:16,982
Up, up and wail!

367
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:23,924
Couldn't we start with a stepladder?

368
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:29,397
Nonsense. The best way to learn
is the sparrow way.

369
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:33,938
- What's that?
- A good boot outta the nest!

370
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,921
This teachin' business is harder than it looks.

371
00:31:42,304 --> 00:31:44,374
There's gotta be someone else, Angie.

372
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:48,438
- Well, there is one place we haven't tried.
- Who's that?

373
00:31:48,545 --> 00:31:51,127
- Armageddon Demolition.
- Get 'em on the phone.

374
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,646
- Armageddon Now. Sergeant Bill Case.
- Hi, this is Tim Carson here in Deedstown.

375
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:06,065
- Sir, I've got a building I need torn down...
- I volunteer.

376
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:09,817
- You haven't seen it yet.
- No need. Natural, man-made, I make it gone.

377
00:32:09,922 --> 00:32:11,610
Hold on, please.

378
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,397
- In your face!
- What was that?

379
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:20,950
Just a little extermination job.
Occupant has a gopher problem.

380
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:23,029
Correction. Had.

381
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:26,010
I see. So when can we meet?

382
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,378
Tomorrow, 1300 hours. Your HQ.

383
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,933
Eat your Wheaties and be sharp, soldier.

384
00:32:34,784 --> 00:32:36,090
Are we insured?

385
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,993
Well, the flying went over like a lead coffin.

386
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:43,291
Now, I want you to go through
this wall right here.

387
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:45,757
How about I start with tissue paper
and work up?

388
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:47,994
No. Now, loosen up, champ.

389
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:51,127
Say "I am invincible."

390
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,513
I am... in a heap of trouble.

391
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:58,484
Stop that. Now, look at this spot
and concentrate.

392
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:02,385
- See the wall.
- I see the wall.

393
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:04,596
Now, be the wall.

394
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,723
- I am the wall.
- Now go through the wall.

395
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:11,195
I am going through the wall.

396
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:16,564
That's what the public wants - new faces.

397
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:21,083
OK, forget walls. Try for a good visual.

398
00:33:21,153 --> 00:33:23,125
Watch me.

399
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:26,874
Heads up, bone bag!

400
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:30,388
- Now you.
- All right.

401
00:33:33,537 --> 00:33:35,902
Sorry. Giraffe imitations are out this year.

402
00:33:35,968 --> 00:33:37,722
Oh, rats.

403
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:40,212
Keep tryin'.

404
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:53,305
- This better be important.
- Casper's in Deedstown.

405
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:57,431
- You'll never guess who's with him.
- I hate guessing.

406
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:02,905
- Snivel?
- Sorry, Your Playful One. How foolish of me.

407
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,973
The answer is the ghostly trio.

408
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,177
- You'd better not be wrong.
- There's more!

409
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:15,606
They're teaching Casper their unorthodox
or, may I say, illegal ghostly techniques.

410
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,826
They hope to use Casper
to put you in your place.

411
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:22,334
Don't even say those words.

412
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:26,647
Those Halloweenies can't outteach me.

413
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,033
Check on their progress.
I want a full report tomorrow.

414
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,290
Good thing I'm already dead
or that would have killed me.

415
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:47,256
So she's not a genius,
but she moves like a gazelle.

416
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:52,343
If Maggie doesn't get into this dance club, it
could ruin her chances of going to Stanford.

417
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,364
I wanted to go there, it didn't work out. So
she could use a little extra help, you know?

418
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,803
Yes, of course. Will you excuse me?

419
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,987
Still no Dad, huh?

420
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,962
He promised he'd be here.

421
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:10,937
Well, it's still early.

422
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:16,018
- Do you want some punch?
- I already had three gallons. Thanks.

423
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:18,428
Don't worry. He'll show.

424
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:30,645
It got a bit trashed.
I thought you'd like it back.

425
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:32,986
Thanks, Jennifer.

426
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,803
- So which one's yours?
- Right there.

427
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:44,310
- So you really believe in all this ghost stuff?
- Sure. Don't you?

428
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:46,900
Get real.

429
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,877
Ghosts are all around.
You just gotta know where to look.

430
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,152
Well, maybe you can show me one someday.

431
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:54,523
Sure.

432
00:35:56,064 --> 00:35:58,266
Sorry. I gotta go.

433
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,637
One, two, three, four, five, six...

434
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,806
All right, Tim. I'm outta here.

435
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,174
The Martians have escaped
from my pencil sharpener.

436
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,100
That's nice.

437
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:28,311
- Tim!
- What?

438
00:36:28,384 --> 00:36:31,862
You really should go home and play
with your kid. He probably misses you.

439
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:36,057
Chris is fine. I've got that handled.
He knows that I'm up to my teeth in work.

440
00:36:36,126 --> 00:36:39,124
And it is not as easy to be a dad and a mom.

441
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,880
Take it easy. I'm sorry I asked.

442
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:45,689
- And I apologize.
- It's all right, no problem.

443
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,179
This Applegate thing
has got me so wound up.

444
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:51,189
I know, but you really should take a break.

445
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,327
I wish I could. I gotta finish
these sketches for the mayor.

446
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:57,364
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

447
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:05,817
Josh is doing very well this semester.
Really gotten his grades up.

448
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:09,943
Here's a flier. We're having a rally
to save Applegate Mansion tomorrow.

449
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:12,533
Josh, keep up the good work.
I'll see you tomorrow.

450
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:15,955
There's your flier.
You're doing very well this semester.

451
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:18,201
Thanks a lot for coming tonight.

452
00:37:22,112 --> 00:37:25,110
- How you doin'?
- I knew he'd flake out.

453
00:37:25,248 --> 00:37:29,107
- Well, something probably came up.
- Something always comes up.

454
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,014
Phantoms, poltergeists?

455
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,659
- Which one is your favorite?
- Banshees.

456
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:42,011
They make a lot of noise
and nobody can understand them.

457
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,754
They're Irish. They usually
appearjust before...

458
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:51,317
My dad thinks I have
an overactive imagination.

459
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:54,170
A good imagination is a powerful tool.

460
00:37:54,592 --> 00:37:59,097
It allows us to do great things,
like saving a landmark against all odds.

461
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:03,930
I like the way you think. You know, you work
almost as hard as my dad.

462
00:38:04,864 --> 00:38:08,690
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.
Let me walk you to the door.

463
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:14,453
Why don't you have your dad come for
a private conference tomorrow at four?

464
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,169
- This way we can all meet.
- Sure, but he'll probably just bag it again.

465
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,919
Sometimes I think he likes
his job more than me.

466
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:23,357
Well, he may surprise you.

467
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:27,697
- Bye, Miss Fistergraff.
- Bye, Chris. I'll see you tomorrow.

468
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:32,596
Great kid, crummy dad.

469
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:43,865
No, no, no. Shivery shrieks
have gotta come from deep inside you.

470
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:46,039
Six feet under. Try again.

471
00:38:49,055 --> 00:38:53,657
Go sit down. That "boo" stuff wouldn't
even give a fleshie goose bumps.

472
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:55,668
I'm doing the best I can.

473
00:38:58,399 --> 00:39:00,469
By George, he's got it!

474
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,241
Sorry. I sat on a rusty spring.

475
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:08,726
Oh, forget it, you guys.
We've been at it all day.

476
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,823
Possession, flying, shape-changing,
dismemberment.

477
00:39:12,928 --> 00:39:15,413
Casperjust ain't gettin' it.

478
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:19,543
- But I'm trying my hardest.
- Sure, kid, but you got no style.

479
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,428
It's cos your motives are all wrong.

480
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:25,874
Basically, you don't wanna scare humans.

481
00:39:26,592 --> 00:39:30,812
- Well, what's wrong with being nice to them?
- I'm not hearing this.

482
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,978
I think I'm gonna be sick.

483
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:37,971
Now look what you've done.
You're breathin' life into him.

484
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,964
Look, little guy. We know deep down inside
you're really gruesome and horrible.

485
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,307
But we're just not seein' it.

486
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,754
Besides, if you don't learn,
it makes us look bad.

487
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:51,317
- I'll work harder.
- Sorry, runt.

488
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,722
We've come to a parting of the waves.

489
00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:57,205
There's no place in this world
for a friendly ghost.

490
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:00,309
- Get lost!
- Get going!

491
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:02,619
Get a life!

492
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:12,401
I know, I know. I'm late.
I'm gonna grab a bite at work.

493
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:14,742
Chris.

494
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,180
Chris.

495
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:21,370
- Chris, what's the matter?
- You totally missed my open house.

496
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:25,112
- Was that last night?
- I was the only kid there without a parent.

497
00:40:25,183 --> 00:40:27,515
Buddy, I'm so sorry.

498
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,679
Look, the mayor's
pressuring me hard right now and...

499
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,366
Everything's more important than me.

500
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,087
I'm gonna make it up to you, pal.

501
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:40,054
Do you know what today is?

502
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:46,231
Do you know what today is?
It's wild-and-crazy-guy day!

503
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:48,853
- Yeah, right.
- Yes, it is.

504
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:54,357
Says it right here. You and I are supposed
to have a guys-only sit-down dinner.

505
00:40:55,937 --> 00:41:00,058
- With no interruptions?
- You read my mind.

506
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:02,393
Honest?

507
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,882
And later you and I
are going to the batting cage,

508
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:07,673
- and this time I'm gonna beat you.
- Yes!

509
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:08,918
- Deal?
- Deal!

510
00:41:09,025 --> 00:41:10,615
- Gotta go.
- Wait.

511
00:41:10,753 --> 00:41:15,485
Since you didn't show up last night,
I've had to set up another meeting for today.

512
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:18,068
You know, a parent-teacher one, at four.

513
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,311
Four? But I have...

514
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,448
Chris, buddy, you can count on me.

515
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:33,268
- See you later, alligator.
- Don't forget! Four o'clock.

516
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:36,116
Yes!

517
00:41:39,136 --> 00:41:40,922
Yeah!

518
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,717
Yeah, well, I'm glad one of us is happy.

519
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:50,164
Hey, Casper. Did you hear? Dad and I
are going to the batting cage tonight.

520
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,392
Then it's good I stopped by now.
I just got the boot.

521
00:41:55,007 --> 00:41:57,110
So I'm leavin' town for good.

522
00:41:57,217 --> 00:42:01,273
- You can't leave. What's wrong?
- Oh, I'm a lousy ghost.

523
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,407
No, you're not. You know
how to go into stealth mode.

524
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:07,028
Big whoop. That's the only trick I know.

525
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:10,296
- Didn't the trio help you?
- Nah. They dumped me.

526
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,852
Seems I'm too nice to learn anything.

527
00:42:12,992 --> 00:42:16,338
So I'm not a human, I'm not a ghost.

528
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,060
- I'm a nothing.
- Stop it.

529
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:21,947
If those three losers won't help you,
then I will.

530
00:42:22,016 --> 00:42:25,209
- Why waste your time?
- Cos you're my pal.

531
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,986
- I am? Really?
- Yeah. And buds gotta help each other.

532
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,524
You couldn't help a dead alien fall over.

533
00:42:33,856 --> 00:42:35,959
Very funny, marshmallowhead.

534
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:03,063
- The coast is clear.
- Are you sure about this?

535
00:43:03,136 --> 00:43:07,224
Come on. I'm gonna teach you
how to be a ghost, even if it kills you.

536
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:10,610
- No offense.
- Sure. Pick on the living-impaired.

537
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:14,873
We'll skip over the section on scaring
and stick with the basics.

538
00:43:14,975 --> 00:43:17,525
Lesson one - going through walls.

539
00:43:17,632 --> 00:43:20,564
Hey, no problem. I've got that wired.

540
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:22,938
- Watch!
- Wait!

541
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,356
I think you're gonna need this
right about now.

542
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:50,937
What? What'd I say?

543
00:43:55,168 --> 00:43:57,108
A ghost!

544
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:01,334
Yep. This must be the place.

545
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:06,294
Help! I need you!

546
00:44:06,368 --> 00:44:08,438
Right now!

547
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,858
- Smooth move, Ex-Lax.
- So how'd I do?

548
00:44:20,128 --> 00:44:23,922
A for enthusiasm, but D minus for control.
Follow me.

549
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:30,838
Hi.

550
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:33,396
Hurry up. It's stuffy in here.

551
00:44:35,392 --> 00:44:37,364
Quiet, Casper.

552
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,461
You need to clean this thing out.

553
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:53,492
Quit complaining.
That was lesson two - changing shapes.

554
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:55,485
You're right. Thanks, teach.

555
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:58,264
OK. Lesson three - invisibility.

556
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:01,043
I know that one already.

557
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:04,855
Yeah, but now I want you
to carry something heavy as well.

558
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,937
- Try picking up that blue book.
- You got it.

559
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,317
A ghost taking lessons
from a human? The horror!

560
00:45:22,912 --> 00:45:24,884
Casper!

561
00:45:26,465 --> 00:45:28,372
Sorry.

562
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:33,047
Chris, I'm surprised at you. Books are
our friends. You must treat them nicely.

563
00:45:33,153 --> 00:45:36,664
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry. That was me.

564
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:40,792
- Be more careful.
- If I'm invisible, I can't see where I'm going.

565
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:43,282
Sh! This is a library.

566
00:45:44,736 --> 00:45:48,148
Who are you talking to, space cadet?
Your imaginary pals?

567
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:51,537
That's only cos daydreamers
don't have any real friends.

568
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:55,029
Don't you have some place to go,
like detention?

569
00:45:55,873 --> 00:45:59,699
Come on, guys. Let's go.
He's not bothering us.

570
00:46:00,864 --> 00:46:03,544
You think you're so smart, don't ya?

571
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:06,614
- Freak.
- Brock's talkin' to ya, geek.

572
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:07,961
Yeah, geek.

573
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,003
You'd better watch out.

574
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:17,404
- They say this library is haunted.
- By who? Ernest Hauntingway?

575
00:46:21,217 --> 00:46:23,419
No. William Shakespook.

576
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,067
I can't see! Get this off!

577
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:42,778
This is some sort of trick, right?

578
00:46:42,848 --> 00:46:44,951
Darn right. He's messin' with us.

579
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,258
- What?
- Excuse me.

580
00:46:51,326 --> 00:46:54,837
- Brock, I think you should chill off.
- Make me, runt.

581
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:58,359
Earth to butthead, you're clear for takeoff.

582
00:47:00,352 --> 00:47:02,292
You're a regular rocketman!

583
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:08,634
Stop it! Get the thing off! Please, help!

584
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:12,598
Stop! Stop!

585
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:24,760
There I was, reading my editorial section -
where I always do -

586
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:27,798
when all of a sudden it appeared before me.

587
00:47:31,104 --> 00:47:33,076
Oh, man!

588
00:47:39,008 --> 00:47:41,046
Come on.

589
00:47:43,616 --> 00:47:48,402
- This is going on your permanent record.
- But there was a ghost and...

590
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,464
Nothin' like overkill.

591
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:55,574
He had it coming.

592
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:01,623
This is going on his permanent record.

593
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:07,957
Way to go, Casper! I think you're ready
for the big time. High-five, bud.

594
00:48:08,064 --> 00:48:11,161
Yeah. I wanna go out and try my new powers.

595
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,203
Happy haunting!

596
00:48:14,687 --> 00:48:16,692
Yes!

597
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:39,932
- I'm sorry.
- I think I lost him.

598
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:43,161
You must be Bill Case.
Hi, I'm Tim Carson. Nice to meet you.

599
00:48:43,231 --> 00:48:47,025
Ditto. So what kind of ordnance
are you lookin' for here?

600
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,935
Fragmentation grenades,
C-4 explosives, missiles,

601
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:54,267
plastique, TNT, cherry bombs?
Help me out here!

602
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,699
I don't know.

603
00:48:57,696 --> 00:49:00,311
This oughta do the trick.

604
00:49:00,384 --> 00:49:04,658
You can detonate this with a plunger
or a timer or a simple open flame.

605
00:49:05,377 --> 00:49:08,669
- That isn't real, is it?
- Affirmative.

606
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:13,655
- Is that the target there?
- Yeah. This is it.

607
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:18,938
Very few problems can't be solved with
a suitable application of high explosives.

608
00:49:19,008 --> 00:49:22,387
Tomorrow that place will be bite-size.

609
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:26,685
- Do you think you could put this out, please?
- Don't worry about that.

610
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:29,169
Doesn't go boom without this.

611
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:35,063
- See that? Harmless as a steak knife.
- Except one thing. My office is on fire!

612
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:42,296
- Damage control. Drop and roll.
- Aren't you trained in this? Put it out!

613
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,821
Now that I'm a real ghost I gotta
try out my new talents on someone.

614
00:50:02,688 --> 00:50:05,881
If I can scare him, I can scare anyone.

615
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,669
Here goes.

616
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:13,817
- Hello. How may I help you?
- This is a stickup. Open it up!

617
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:32,050
- A g-g-ghost!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

618
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:36,120
Hey, wait! I know you're a ghost,
but you just saved my life!

619
00:50:36,255 --> 00:50:38,162
- Thank you.
- Really?

620
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,408
Sure. How about some jerky?

621
00:50:41,055 --> 00:50:44,729
He likes me. Wow! This is great!

622
00:50:45,248 --> 00:50:47,765
Finally, I feel so alive.

623
00:50:54,464 --> 00:50:57,144
Miss Fistergraff? Hi.
Time for our conference?

624
00:50:57,215 --> 00:51:00,627
Yeah, Chris. Come on in.
I was just getting ready for my big rally.

625
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:03,930
Maybe I could get you to carry
one of these signs tomorrow.

626
00:51:04,033 --> 00:51:06,332
Oh, no. There I go again. I'm sorry.

627
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,041
- Is my dad here yet?
- No, but he has a few minutes, honey.

628
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:15,634
He's coming this time. I know it.

629
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:18,970
- Come on. I don't want you to be late.
- The teacher's name is...

630
00:51:19,071 --> 00:51:20,978
Fester or Fister...

631
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:23,670
- Fistergraff.
- Right. Bye-bye.

632
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:28,987
- Would that be Sheila Fistergraff?
- Yeah, I think so.

633
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,005
She's the one behind
the Save the Mansion movement.

634
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:36,601
Chris's teacher?

635
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,733
I should have known.

636
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:43,121
Parent-teacher conference. My Aunt Sally!

637
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,985
That's really good. You're a good artist.

638
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,916
Excuse me.

639
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:53,171
Sheila Fistergraff.

640
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,657
But, Miss Lions, these conferences
are essential to the students...

641
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:03,831
What?

642
00:52:03,904 --> 00:52:06,269
This is school business.

643
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:09,845
No, it has nothing to do with the mansion.

644
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:13,654
Tell Mr Carson if he keeps
dodging these meetings,

645
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:17,337
the next call he'll get will be
from the board of education.

646
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:22,744
Chris, I'm sorry.

647
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:27,100
- I'm afraid that your father...
- Isn't gonna show.

648
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:32,499
Honey, I'm sure it's not your fault. I'm sure
he's under a lot of pressure with his job.

649
00:52:34,721 --> 00:52:37,139
So what else is new?

650
00:53:02,943 --> 00:53:04,086
Come in.

651
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,742
Chris, you shoulda seen me. I was awesome.

652
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:09,148
- People all over town liked me.
- Yahoo.

653
00:53:09,248 --> 00:53:12,148
From now on, I'm gonna
use my powers to help people.

654
00:53:12,224 --> 00:53:15,570
- I wanna be their friend.
- I'm so happy for you.

655
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:19,228
- What's wrong?
- Dad. He flaked out again.

656
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:21,267
He forgets everything about me.

657
00:53:22,015 --> 00:53:25,013
Parents don't like going to school
any more than kids do.

658
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,701
But I'm sure he'll remember
your baseball thing.

659
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:31,154
Yeah, the batting cages.
We're supposed to have dinner too.

660
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:33,180
All right! Get pumped, dude.

661
00:53:33,312 --> 00:53:36,921
Then I'll top it off by introducing him
to my best friend.

662
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:38,963
- Who's that?
- You, doofus.

663
00:53:39,072 --> 00:53:42,037
He'll have a hard time forgetting that.

664
00:53:47,072 --> 00:53:49,306
It's my teacher! Hide!

665
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,013
- Miss Fistergraff.
- Hi.

666
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:57,522
You left this at school
and I thought you might want it back.

667
00:53:57,632 --> 00:54:00,019
Thanks. Do you want a soda or anything?

668
00:54:01,664 --> 00:54:04,246
- Sure, all right.
- Come on in.

669
00:54:07,295 --> 00:54:09,497
I'll be right back.

670
00:54:11,743 --> 00:54:14,423
I didn't know your dad
liked Frank Lloyd Wright.

671
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:18,419
- Oh, yeah. He's a big fan.
- There's hope for him yet.

672
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,770
What's this piece?

673
00:54:32,511 --> 00:54:34,876
That's a toy coatrack.

674
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:39,092
That's so cute.

675
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,098
- Must have missed.
- No, here. I'll get it.

676
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:50,233
You look around.

677
00:55:01,952 --> 00:55:05,364
- Here's me as a Klingon.
- I love Star Trek,

678
00:55:05,919 --> 00:55:10,040
- Did you see The Wrath of Khan?
- That was a classic.

679
00:55:10,145 --> 00:55:14,844
You know, I was really hopin'
to talk to your dad about the mansion.

680
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,040
Did you know that in 1805
the Applegates founded this town?

681
00:55:18,111 --> 00:55:21,239
Without them, none of us
would even be living here.

682
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:25,939
What?

683
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,282
How... how interesting.

684
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:34,069
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, it's true.

685
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:38,233
Well, I guess I'd better get goin'.

686
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:40,537
Big rally tomorrow. Wish me luck.

687
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:42,580
Good luck.

688
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:47,570
Thank you.

689
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:54,037
Your porch light's out.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

690
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:55,995
Good night.

691
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:58,679
Close call. I don't think she likes me.

692
00:55:58,816 --> 00:56:02,108
- Come on. We've got a dinner to make.
- So let's do it.

693
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,957
Better keep your head down.
Nosey neighbors.

694
00:56:08,063 --> 00:56:10,035
Losing Casper.

695
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:15,417
- How about some music?
- All right!

696
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:24,025
Now Casper's the fleshie's slave?

697
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:28,501
It's time to report in to my master.

698
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:33,113
- What?
- Perfectly safe. All done by remote control.

699
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:35,253
No wires, no fuss,

700
00:57:35,392 --> 00:57:38,072
and you, Mr Mayor... you are a hero.

701
00:57:38,848 --> 00:57:43,666
OK. But how are you going to stick the TNT in
without those protesters knowing?

702
00:57:44,384 --> 00:57:47,284
It's already in, Mr Mayor. It's already in.

703
00:58:15,904 --> 00:58:17,909
That'll warn ya.

704
00:59:33,215 --> 00:59:35,220
Here we are.

705
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:49,682
See you manana, boys.

706
01:00:01,183 --> 01:00:02,163
Right.

707
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:05,782
A human teaching haunting techniques?

708
01:00:05,856 --> 01:00:09,399
It's unorthodox, it's unheard of, it's...

709
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:13,264
- Un-American?
...disgusting! Keep your eye on them.

710
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,250
I'm on my way.

711
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:25,689
Can you believe this?
That store owner thinks ghosts are friendly.

712
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:32,019
That was Casper, I tell ya. He's goin'
around town doing good deeds for everyone.

713
01:00:32,287 --> 01:00:35,252
- Revolting!
- The kid's a menace!

714
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,495
I don't know. I kinda liked him around.
It was sorta like a family.

715
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,052
Am I hearin' this?

716
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,385
I can't help it. I feel stuff.

717
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,169
Yeah? Well, feel this.

718
01:00:51,103 --> 01:00:55,323
A friendly ghost is a threat to all ghosts.

719
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:59,478
So spread out and find that little poltergeek,

720
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:02,549
and don't be too gentle about it.

721
01:01:07,616 --> 01:01:10,647
Looks good, pal, but you forgot a plate.

722
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:12,953
- I want you to join us.
- Really?

723
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:14,931
Gee, thanks!

724
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,505
It's Dad. I'm gonna introduce you to him,
so wait by my window. All right?

725
01:01:27,616 --> 01:01:30,680
OK, but what should I say?

726
01:01:31,135 --> 01:01:33,140
Well, just be friendly.

727
01:01:34,943 --> 01:01:37,361
- Chris?
- Now go!

728
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,661
Chris. Chris!

729
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,171
I can't open the door for strangers.

730
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:48,920
I'm sorry about the conference. I had
an emergency. My office caught on fire.

731
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:51,292
Yeah, and a gremlin ate my homework.

732
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:56,178
- Look. Char-broiled, medium well.
- Admit it. You forgot.

733
01:01:56,287 --> 01:01:59,384
I didn't forget about
wild-and-crazy-guy night.

734
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,772
OK, fine. Hurry up.

735
01:02:07,007 --> 01:02:09,851
Chris, that is great!

736
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,205
- Thanks. I had help.
- Help?

737
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:16,308
- Yeah, I had a friend over.
- Yeah? Who's that?

738
01:02:17,088 --> 01:02:19,768
A new kid. In fact, he's comin' over for dinner.

739
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:24,636
You didn't have to do that. We could
go to a restaurant, maybe that Chinese one.

740
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,252
You tore it down.

741
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,391
When did I...? Yeah, I did.
But I put up a Yogurt Hut.

742
01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:35,860
Very sensitive. Why do you tear everything
down? I like that old Applegate place.

743
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:39,348
You're sounding like your teacher,
and she is gonna get me fired.

744
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:44,179
Then you and I, we gotta live under a freeway.
It would just be so...

745
01:02:44,256 --> 01:02:46,490
At least she listens to me.

746
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:51,096
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You never pay attention to me.

747
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:54,493
You don't come to my baseball games,
or take me to the movies,

748
01:02:54,592 --> 01:02:57,010
or listen to what I say.

749
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,026
Chris...

750
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:02,099
Chris, that's ridiculous.

751
01:03:03,775 --> 01:03:06,162
Chris, you know that when...

752
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:12,696
You promised. No interruptions.

753
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,666
Can I take a phone call? The phone is ringing.

754
01:03:15,743 --> 01:03:17,114
Hello.

755
01:03:17,216 --> 01:03:19,221
Yes. Mr Mayor. Sure.

756
01:03:20,415 --> 01:03:25,397
- The memo. Of course I saw it. I just...
- No, Dad. The batting cage. You promised.

757
01:03:27,456 --> 01:03:30,006
- That was the mayor.
- I'm your son.

758
01:03:31,712 --> 01:03:35,255
- Chris, don't do this.
- At least meet my friend first.

759
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:38,646
OK. When's he gonna show?

760
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,065
- I think he's here right now.
- Oh, yeah? Oh, really?

761
01:03:42,142 --> 01:03:45,206
- Well, I don't hear the doorbell.
- Trust me.

762
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,699
Hello, sir. I'm Casper.

763
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,138
No, no.

764
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,115
Yo, dude. Big C here.

765
01:03:53,024 --> 01:03:55,989
Gotcha, runt. You're comin' with us.

766
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,645
- Chris needs me.
- Too bad, bulbhead.

767
01:03:58,783 --> 01:04:01,148
Your fleshie-friendly days are over.

768
01:04:02,113 --> 01:04:05,177
I've gotta warn you,
he's kinda different, so be nice.

769
01:04:05,248 --> 01:04:06,173
OK.

770
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:08,689
Dad, meet Casper.

771
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:13,624
- Where is he?
- Well, he's a ghost.

772
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,358
- Chris, I don't have time for games.
- It's not a game. Ghosts are real.

773
01:04:18,462 --> 01:04:20,729
- Casper, come on.
- Chris, stop.

774
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:24,246
He probably went to
the Applegate Mansion. Let's go.

775
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,422
That Sheila Fistergraff put you up to this.

776
01:04:26,592 --> 01:04:28,891
- You're not listening.
- This is ridiculous.

777
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,804
Why can't you believe me? Mom would have.

778
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:36,340
That's it! You have an overactive imagination.
It is time to grow up.

779
01:04:37,086 --> 01:04:39,385
This goes.

780
01:04:39,456 --> 01:04:41,494
This, and this.

781
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,872
This.

782
01:04:42,944 --> 01:04:45,146
Look at this stuff.

783
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:48,529
- Those are mine!
- This is trash.

784
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,611
No!

785
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,854
Chris!

786
01:04:57,888 --> 01:05:00,306
You clean this up!

787
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:03,636
I have to go see the mayor.

788
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:07,449
You can't! What about our dinner,
and the batting cage?

789
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,551
- I don't wanna hear it, Chris.
- It's not fair!

790
01:05:15,615 --> 01:05:17,914
You love yourjob more than me!

791
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:25,552
Casper, how could you?

792
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:42,490
Come on, guys. I've got to help Chris.

793
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:45,206
We don't give a flyin' banshee.

794
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:49,206
- This fleshie stuff has gotta stop.
- It's ruining our reputations.

795
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:54,709
You've been a goody-goody too long
and now it's time to pay the price.

796
01:05:54,815 --> 01:05:57,463
- Pay the piper.
- Paper or plastic.

797
01:05:57,695 --> 01:05:59,481
Look! Elvis's ghost!

798
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:01,971
- Where?
- Where's the king?

799
01:06:03,518 --> 01:06:06,897
Stupid. Everyone knows Elvis is still alive.

800
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:09,235
Find him.

801
01:06:21,855 --> 01:06:24,089
Wow! You really clobbered 'em tonight.

802
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:28,795
- I'm almost better than you, huh, Dad?
- Absolutely. Wait till we tell Mom.

803
01:06:30,623 --> 01:06:32,595
Hey, Mom!

804
01:06:46,177 --> 01:06:50,845
- You got me a month of detention, geek.
- Wish I could have done more for you.

805
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:52,117
Here you are.

806
01:06:53,023 --> 01:06:56,729
- What do you think you're doing?
- Come on, you've had your fun.

807
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,969
You're not standing up for this worm?

808
01:06:59,071 --> 01:07:01,937
No. It's just that... Let's go.

809
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:05,174
I think she likes the wimp.

810
01:07:05,247 --> 01:07:09,041
- So? Do ya?
- No. Let go.

811
01:07:10,688 --> 01:07:14,460
- Leave her alone!
- Mr Tough Guy.

812
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:16,565
Stop it.

813
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,586
Why don't you beat it? I never
liked you hanging around anyway.

814
01:07:22,782 --> 01:07:26,260
You're coming with us
to the Applegate Mansion, weirdo.

815
01:07:29,696 --> 01:07:32,344
- Let go of me.
- Shut up, you little jerk.

816
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:37,137
- Let go. You're hurting me.
- Shut up, you little wimp.

817
01:07:37,214 --> 01:07:40,080
- Don't be such a scaredy-cat.
- Yeah, wuss.

818
01:07:42,111 --> 01:07:44,083
- Let me go.
- Shut up!

819
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,195
Quiet, Chris. Sissy creep.

820
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,027
- How about over there?
- Yeah.

821
01:07:52,288 --> 01:07:54,260
You are gonna die.

822
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:07,542
- Let me out, Brock!
- Oops! Looks like you're stayin'.

823
01:08:07,614 --> 01:08:10,001
Let me out, Brock!

824
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,323
Sleep tight, don't let the dead-bugs bite.

825
01:09:05,823 --> 01:09:07,675
- No luck.
- Ditto.

826
01:09:07,774 --> 01:09:12,986
A wimpy ghost is loose and it's our fault.
What could be worse?

827
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:17,786
It's worse! Way worse.

828
01:09:17,886 --> 01:09:20,304
- Kibosh!
- Count on it.

829
01:09:20,704 --> 01:09:23,735
See, I told you they were here.
I caught 'em red-handed.

830
01:09:23,808 --> 01:09:26,773
- So where's Chrysler?
- Casper.

831
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:30,646
- He's...
- Find him.

832
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,881
Yes, Your Backhandedness.

833
01:09:35,295 --> 01:09:38,293
Big K, what a surprise.

834
01:09:38,397 --> 01:09:41,428
- You're lookin' trim.
- Silence.

835
01:09:41,504 --> 01:09:44,950
I've been searching for you slackers
far too long.

836
01:09:45,694 --> 01:09:48,560
- Not the cage.
- I hate the cage.

837
01:09:51,424 --> 01:09:54,803
Now, to find your little protege Canker.

838
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:13,659
- Hello.
- Mr Carson, is this line secure?

839
01:10:14,367 --> 01:10:17,113
- Yeah. Who is this?
- It's Bill Case, sir.

840
01:10:17,951 --> 01:10:19,923
Bill, yeah. What time is it?

841
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:24,345
It's 0600. You don't sound good.
Have you been tortured?

842
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,630
No, I just was working late.
I must have conked out on the couch.

843
01:10:30,078 --> 01:10:32,465
So we are still on target
for Operation Sawdust?

844
01:10:32,576 --> 01:10:34,908
Yeah, sure. You mean the demolition?

845
01:10:35,552 --> 01:10:37,622
First class.

846
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:39,799
Are there any demonstrators there?

847
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:44,276
Affirmative. A small platoon,
but they're well outside the perimeter.

848
01:10:44,351 --> 01:10:47,382
But they can't get to the detonator, can they?

849
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,541
Not to worry, sir. I am unstoppable.
That shack is nuked, waxed, history.

850
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,003
OK.

851
01:10:58,143 --> 01:11:02,648
Look, I'll be there soon. If I'm not there
by 6:30 on the dot, demolish the place.

852
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:04,920
Roger that. Over and out.

853
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:14,936
Oh, well. I have my orders.

854
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:23,833
Chris!

855
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,506
Chris.

856
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:33,267
Chris.

857
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:37,332
Chris!

858
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:40,467
Chris!

859
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,835
Chris! Chris!

860
01:11:46,143 --> 01:11:48,148
Chris.

861
01:12:08,608 --> 01:12:11,900
"Sorry I'm always bothering you,
so I ran away."

862
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:14,266
"Now you'll have the time
you need for your work."

863
01:12:14,366 --> 01:12:17,178
Chris, I'm sorry. Last night wasn't my fault.

864
01:12:17,952 --> 01:12:19,957
Get away! Get away!

865
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,765
Careful, Mr Carson.

866
01:12:24,863 --> 01:12:28,024
- You are not pulling my leg.
- It's OK, really.

867
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,483
I do not believe in ghosts.

868
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,012
Here, is this better?

869
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:43,865
- Are you here?
- Boy, Chris was right.

870
01:12:43,966 --> 01:12:46,745
You really don't have an imagination.

871
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,852
Chris?

872
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,024
You know where my son is?
If you've done something to my son...

873
01:12:52,095 --> 01:12:57,077
Relax, Mr Carson. I'm Chris's best friend.
In fact, I'm his only friend.

874
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:02,901
- You're Casper?
- In the flesh, or so to speak.

875
01:13:03,007 --> 01:13:06,233
- Where's Chris?
- He ran away.

876
01:13:08,129 --> 01:13:12,567
It seems as if I'm always pushing away
the people that I love.

877
01:13:12,671 --> 01:13:15,963
He's only ten, Mr Carson, and very lonely.

878
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:18,744
He's lonely? How can he be lonely?
I'm always there.

879
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,332
No. You're always working.

880
01:13:24,287 --> 01:13:26,325
Yeah. He said that.

881
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:29,363
Find him. You need each other.

882
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,125
You're right, Casper.

883
01:13:35,263 --> 01:13:38,489
We do need each other
and we love each other.

884
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,564
Will you help me find him, Casper?

885
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,663
Sure. I bet he's at the Applegate place.
Chris loves it there.

886
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:47,185
That's gonna blow in 15 minutes!

887
01:13:47,294 --> 01:13:49,397
What? I gotta warn Chris.

888
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:51,674
I gotta stop the detonation!

889
01:13:54,143 --> 01:13:56,345
Come on, Bill. Bill.

890
01:13:57,311 --> 01:13:58,323
Bill!

891
01:14:01,152 --> 01:14:03,866
- I gotta find my son. He's in danger.
- Chris?

892
01:14:03,966 --> 01:14:06,353
- You know him?
- Yeah. Get in.

893
01:14:07,422 --> 01:14:09,558
- Where to?
- Applegate place.

894
01:14:15,231 --> 01:14:17,618
- You're Sheila Fistergraff.
- You got it.

895
01:14:17,726 --> 01:14:19,895
What'd you do this time?
Forget his birthday?

896
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,103
You're always jumping to conclusions.

897
01:14:22,176 --> 01:14:24,856
All I know is I'm not destroying this town.

898
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:32,309
You're crazy. Stop this car!

899
01:14:32,383 --> 01:14:36,985
You're so stubborn. You don't understand.
Without change this town is dead.

900
01:14:41,823 --> 01:14:44,210
At least I'm not killing it like you are.

901
01:14:45,215 --> 01:14:46,903
- Killing it?
- Can't you see?

902
01:14:46,975 --> 01:14:49,590
I am just trying to save this town!

903
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,765
Chris! Chris, where are you?

904
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:08,698
- Chris!
- Casper?

905
01:15:08,832 --> 01:15:11,960
- Chris! Help me out here, buddy.
- In here.

906
01:15:14,272 --> 01:15:16,986
Come on, Chris. We gotta get outta here fast.

907
01:15:17,086 --> 01:15:19,865
- Where'd you go last night?
- Never mind that.

908
01:15:19,936 --> 01:15:22,650
There's a bomb in the house. Let's go.

909
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:27,121
Great.

910
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,986
The sniveler has sniveled his finest snivel!

911
01:15:40,062 --> 01:15:44,761
Once I grab that rat Capper,
it's back to Processing for all of you

912
01:15:44,863 --> 01:15:47,609
for some radical retraining.

913
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:56,245
More left-wing protesters.
Well, they shall not pass.

914
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,707
No! No, no, no!

915
01:15:58,783 --> 01:16:01,300
Excuse me. Bill, where are you?

916
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,706
Bill, where are you?

917
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:07,476
- Bill, where are you?
- Who's Bill?

918
01:16:08,352 --> 01:16:10,422
- He's blowing up this house.
- What?

919
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:12,980
There's a bomb in the house.
We've gotta stop him.

920
01:16:13,089 --> 01:16:16,567
That's the first thing you've said
that I agree with. Bill!

921
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,742
Bill, where are you? Bill!

922
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:25,843
Bill! Stop the detonator! At ease, soldier.

923
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:30,325
- Get out of my sector, you libertine.
- This mission is aborted! Stop!

924
01:16:31,904 --> 01:16:34,171
Bill, you freak, it's me - Tim!

925
01:16:34,272 --> 01:16:37,204
How do I know you're not
a master-of-disguise impostor?

926
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:39,697
It's me, I hired you. I'm firing you.

927
01:16:39,774 --> 01:16:42,553
You're done. It's finished. It's over.

928
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:49,044
Tim, are you all right?

929
01:16:52,544 --> 01:16:54,778
I'll be right back.

930
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:07,739
- I'm not gonna get out, am I?
- Don't give up, Chris.

931
01:17:08,575 --> 01:17:11,157
Maybe I can find the bomb and disarm it.

932
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,838
Found it. Yes!

933
01:17:20,478 --> 01:17:24,054
- What's goin' on?
- They're gonna blow up the mansion.

934
01:17:25,278 --> 01:17:27,512
Stop the countdown!

935
01:17:31,422 --> 01:17:33,874
Oh, now what? Think, Casper, think!

936
01:17:42,142 --> 01:17:44,757
Leave that house alone, buster!

937
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,196
Must save reputation.

938
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:23,475
No!

939
01:18:26,336 --> 01:18:28,701
It's past 6:30. You're OK.

940
01:18:29,407 --> 01:18:31,477
I am?

941
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:34,297
I am! Yes!

942
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,612
- We did it!
- Negatory, you sniveling, liberal pansies.

943
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:48,281
My bomb's got a default mechanism. You can
wave bye-bye to that rattrap in one minute.

944
01:18:56,384 --> 01:18:57,843
Oh, no.

945
01:18:59,038 --> 01:19:01,337
You raving yahoo maniac!

946
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:03,924
My only son's in there.

947
01:19:06,879 --> 01:19:09,113
Everybody get back! There's a bomb!

948
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:12,056
There's a bomb! Get back!

949
01:19:15,839 --> 01:19:19,545
One, two, three...

950
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:26,096
Chris! Chris, where are you?

951
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:28,210
In there.

952
01:19:29,407 --> 01:19:32,087
- Chris, where are you?
- Here!

953
01:19:32,192 --> 01:19:35,157
- Open up the door.
- I can't. It's locked.

954
01:19:39,488 --> 01:19:41,493
Wait a minute! Hold on!

955
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:45,241
- Hurry up!
- Hold on, hold on!

956
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,595
- Dad!
- Are you OK?

957
01:19:53,662 --> 01:19:57,969
- We can't let the bomb hurt the mansion.
- But we can't take it outside.

958
01:19:58,081 --> 01:20:01,722
Your dad's right. Go. I'll take care of this.

959
01:20:02,943 --> 01:20:05,242
Great. Now what do I do?

960
01:20:07,646 --> 01:20:09,913
That's their school, O cagey one.

961
01:20:43,518 --> 01:20:45,785
Now I've got you, you little...

962
01:21:05,919 --> 01:21:08,055
Excuse me.

963
01:21:21,151 --> 01:21:23,221
It's still standing.

964
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:25,334
It's still standing!

965
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,031
Soldier, you have failed.
30 days in the stockade.

966
01:21:44,895 --> 01:21:49,333
As I've been saying all along,
we must preserve our historic landmarks.

967
01:21:56,958 --> 01:22:00,217
Would you like an as-boo-rin, sir?

968
01:22:01,727 --> 01:22:04,593
- How did you do that?
- They taught me, sir.

969
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:07,319
We did? Yeah, we did.

970
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,427
Told ya we had great techniques.

971
01:22:10,941 --> 01:22:14,484
Then I was wrong to split you three up.

972
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:18,711
A family as scary as you has my permission
to haunt where you want.

973
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:22,292
But you still need to go through
basic training, dropout.

974
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:26,745
Hey, the little guy stuck up for us.
Now it's our turn.

975
01:22:26,815 --> 01:22:28,820
Sorry, you can't take Casper.

976
01:22:28,926 --> 01:22:32,305
You said yourself that
you can't split up a family.

977
01:22:32,704 --> 01:22:34,676
But he's not related to you.

978
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:38,325
Sure he is. Don't you see the resemblance?

979
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:41,079
- We're...
- His uncles.

980
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:47,577
So you want him, you got him.

981
01:22:47,647 --> 01:22:51,473
But remember the rules.
A family has to stick together

982
01:22:52,125 --> 01:22:54,359
for all time.

983
01:22:54,464 --> 01:22:56,981
Yeah. You're stuck with Catto.

984
01:22:57,055 --> 01:23:02,420
That's Casper. Make sure you four
never darken my tomb again.

985
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,885
Hold real still.

986
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,218
- Sorry, sorry.
- That stings.

987
01:23:20,991 --> 01:23:22,963
- There you go.
- Thank you.

988
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:27,219
Chris, I'm sorry for ignoring you.

989
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:31,280
- I didn't mean to doubt you.
- It's OK, Dad.

990
01:23:33,537 --> 01:23:35,673
I love you, Dad.

991
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:37,946
I love you, son.

992
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:45,107
And you got a great teacher.

993
01:23:49,598 --> 01:23:54,352
- So...?
- So I guess you're one of us now.

994
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:58,039
Yeah, like a family. We'll have a home
and a rumpus room and everything.

995
01:23:58,143 --> 01:24:00,693
And my training, we could start...

996
01:24:00,798 --> 01:24:03,730
What am I hearin'? A home? A rumpus room?

997
01:24:03,806 --> 01:24:06,291
Fatso, you got blubber in your ears.

998
01:24:06,687 --> 01:24:11,355
Didn't ya hear? That little fleshie's
old man's gonna demolish this place,

999
01:24:11,454 --> 01:24:13,394
tear it down for good.

1000
01:24:13,535 --> 01:24:18,769
Pack your bags, Casper. It's haunting
the streets for us. We got bupkis.

1001
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:24,241
- Miss Fistergraff...
- Sheila.

1002
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:27,196
Sheila.

1003
01:24:28,255 --> 01:24:31,067
So, Sheila, I was wondering.

1004
01:24:31,136 --> 01:24:37,843
If we reclassified this place as a historical
building, how could we spice it up?

1005
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:42,809
What if it had a gimmick?
Like it was haunted, maybe?

1006
01:24:43,486 --> 01:24:48,370
- That would bring in tourists.
- Right. But don't we need ghosts for that?

1007
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:52,284
You mean us?

1008
01:24:53,374 --> 01:24:57,168
A place of our own? A tomb with a view?

1009
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:59,762
And from a fleshie?

1010
01:25:00,735 --> 01:25:04,693
This breaks all the rules, but I love you, man.

1011
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:07,669
- Jeez.
- Thanks.

1012
01:25:10,687 --> 01:25:13,815
- What'd we miss?
- You almost got Chris killed.

1013
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:14,865
Cool.

1014
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:18,202
Brock, you're a butt,
and you'll always be a butt.

1015
01:25:19,776 --> 01:25:22,588
So, snoop, your old man's OK.

1016
01:25:22,655 --> 01:25:25,719
If you ever need a favor, just ask.

1017
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:29,237
See those guys? They're the ones
who locked me in here with the bomb.

1018
01:25:29,342 --> 01:25:31,827
- Enough said.
- No, no, no.

1019
01:25:31,903 --> 01:25:35,577
Now that we're a family, you guys
have to try to behave yourselves.

1020
01:25:35,678 --> 01:25:39,124
Oh, we will, shortsheet. We will.

1021
01:25:39,423 --> 01:25:42,071
Cross our hearts and hope to live.

1022
01:25:42,142 --> 01:25:45,401
- Shout's honor.
- Whaddaya say, boys?

1023
01:25:49,055 --> 01:25:51,442
Oh, my God. It's Jennifer. Hide!

1024
01:26:01,951 --> 01:26:07,251
Listen, about last night. Those guys were
jerks, and so was I for hanging with them.

1025
01:26:07,807 --> 01:26:10,194
- Sorry.
- Don't go.

1026
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:14,588
I didn't know they'd locked you in here.
Were you scared?

1027
01:26:14,911 --> 01:26:17,591
- It is haunted, you know.
- Right.

1028
01:26:18,335 --> 01:26:20,885
How would you like to meet a real ghost?

1029
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:24,058
- Say hi to Casper.
- Hi.

1030
01:26:24,703 --> 01:26:27,547
- You're a g-g...
- Please don't stutter.

1031
01:26:27,838 --> 01:26:29,810
Ghost!

1032
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:34,134
Casper, I like the effect you have on people.

1033
01:26:35,263 --> 01:26:38,709
I think I'll be a good influence
on the ghostly trio.

1034
01:26:38,783 --> 01:26:43,930
- That's cos you're friendly, Casper.
- Hey, I like the sound of that.

1035
01:26:43,999 --> 01:26:46,997
Casper, the friendly wraith. No.

1036
01:26:47,647 --> 01:26:50,426
Casper, the pleasant poltergeist.

1037
01:26:50,496 --> 01:26:54,552
Let's just stick with Casper,
the friendly ghost.
