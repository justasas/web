21
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,736
Your Highness, the plane

22
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,812
with His Highness Oscar XV
is just landing.

23
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,859
- Do I give the impression
that I'm blind?

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,009
You seem incapable of cutting out
these monkey trick...

25
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,055
This impertinence mustn't get
into the papers!

26
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,017
See to it, Steiner!
- Yes, Sir.

27
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,418
Mind Out!

28
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,410
The kissing's over,
now come the handshakes.

29
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,098
General Oatis.

30
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,013
- But the Prime Minister and I
know each other.

31
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,691
- Gentlemen,...

32
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,339
But this is...

33
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,617
- Evelina Keletti
and her husband, the tycoon.

34
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,409
- Yes, of course I know you, I saw
your last film,

35
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,575
The Bath-Tub on the Terrace.

36
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,218
You played the title role, didn't you?

37
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,331
- Do you mean to maintain
that Madame Keletti played the bath-tub,

38
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,012
dear Cousin?

39
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,299
You two are Cousins?

40
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,610
- All men are brothers,

41
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,373
and all Kings are Cousins,
Madame Keletti.

42
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,416
- Oh, I see.

43
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,931
Present arms!

44
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,299
Sorry!

45
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,378
You and your monkey tricks!

46
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,052
This is the outcome...!

47
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,778
- Your Highness...
- Silence!

48
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,452
I have a great idea.
I shall abolish the army!

49
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,210
But Your Highness...
- Silence!

50
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,617
You are a public danger!

51
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,218
Today you crippled a man
and this is only a show.

52
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,978
What would you be up to
if war broke out...

53
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,179
When did it happen?

54
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,811
- Seventeen minutes ago.

55
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,812
- I said size three and you hand me
you... head-in-the-clouds!

56
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,774
Take care I don't make you unemployed!

57
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,976
- Professor!
- Yes, Your Highness.

58
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,413
- Can one salute with this thing?

59
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,849
- Of course, and it even has
one great advantage:

60
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,419
no nerves!

61
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,817
Even should a mule kick you,
you wouldn't feel a thing!

62
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,453
- That's fine!

63
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,417
- Keep him amused!

64
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,215
The early morning edition,
Your Highness.

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,456
- Rosebud IV is disbanding his army!

66
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,010
Oscar XV... and artificial hand made
by Professor Somer!

67
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,899
It's in the papers already!

68
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,618
- That's quite normal, Your Highness.

69
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,736
The "Tempo" always knows in advance
what's going to happen!

70
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,299
RUM

71
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,131
Stuart, the editor-in-chief wants
a horoscope made out

72
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,211
for that new singer,
is it ready yet?

73
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,899
- She's going to be terribly po...
popular next year.

74
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,494
- Surely not!
Is she such a talent then?

75
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,458
- No, but she'll be giving birth
to sextuplets!

76
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,852
Come in.

77
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,372
Bobo!

78
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,615
I s... say, man,
I haven't seen you f... for ages!

79
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,695
- Stuart, I got the sack.

80
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,417
- Well, ha... hacking off an arm...

81
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,737
- But I didn't do it on purpose!

82
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,177
- Wha... what can I do for you?

83
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,820
- Look here, please look
into those charts of yours,

84
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,212
about what's going to happen to me, see.
That's no problem for you, is it?!

85
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,534
- Well then, quick, your date of birth!

86
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,258
What have devised, Steiner?

87
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,370
- It's going to happen
tomorrow afternoon.

88
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,530
The lift cable's going to snap,
up on the fourth floor.

89
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,092
And the safety lock won't be working.

90
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,217
- There now, and no disbanding
of the army!

91
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,697
- I have worked out the time table

92
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,691
for the festive ceremony to inaugurate
the new government!

93
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,293
- We haven't won yet!

94
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,008
Some dreadful things have come out,
Bobo! Ah, now I understand!

95
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,536
I'm to be killed!
- And I?

96
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,017
- You're going to s... save my life!

97
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,892
- Me?
- Yes.

98
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,058
You'll take up your trade again.

99
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,219
But I keep butting into the picture.

100
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,251
This has got me flummoxed!

101
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,413
We're probably jo... joining forces!
- You and me? Together?

102
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,059
- Yeah. I'm to become a widow.

103
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,016
A widow twice over.

104
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,658
And then I'm to marry Molly.

105
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,776
- Molly Adams?
You mean to say you love her?

106
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,215
- Yes.
I'm to marry her

107
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,770
and... her husband too.

108
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,170
- You mean a sort of group-marriage?
We wouldn't get the permit!

109
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,570
- The stars don't lie, Bobo!

110
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,539
- Stuart, you're to report
at the Royal Palace immediately!

111
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,210
I don't believe in horoscope much,
but you sure hit it off with that hand.

112
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,099
I'm really curious,l

113
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,210
after all, one doesn't abolish an army
more than once in a lifetime,

114
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,054
so I hope there won't be
any complications.

115
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,215
What will you have now, Mr. Hample?

116
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,933
Tea with rum.

117
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,011
Well, what have you worked out?
- I say, don't keep interrupting him!

118
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,658
- Now then, that's enough!

119
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,858
I've had enough of your incessant
rebukes!

120
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,535
What I really can't understand, Cousin,
is that how a man of your disposition

121
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,417
wants to disband his army!

122
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,058
You have a contentious temperament!

123
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,656
- You'd do better to mind
your own business! You hand's burning.

124
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,417
Damn it!

125
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,380
What do they make these things of?

126
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,656
- That's made of a foot.
- A foot?

127
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,652
- I stepped onto a red-hot poker once
and there was the same bad smell.

128
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,219
- Your Hi... Highness!

129
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,816
I've g... got it!
But it's very dr... dreadful!

130
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,533
- You want to terrify me?

131
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,771
- A co... co... conspiracy!
- Or put me to sleep?

132
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,217
- A co... conspiracy a...
...and an attempt on your life.

133
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,656
Some... something to do with the lift,
and the f... fourth floor!

134
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,893
- A conspiracy? An attempt to be made
on my life? And who's to make it?

135
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,657
Tel Oatis and that Steiner chap
to come here!

136
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,654
Your tea!
- Thank you.

137
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,211
- And how's it all going to end?

138
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,459
- We... well, un... unless
they kill you.

139
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,493
- Original!

140
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,253
- General Oatis, Your Highness,
and Major Steiner.

141
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,370
Oatis, there are preparations

142
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,054
under way for a conspiracy
and an attempt on my life.

143
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,974
It's to take place in the lift,
according to my information.

144
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,930
- That's impossible!
Who told you, Your Highness?

145
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,931
- Mr. Hample, here.

146
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,933
The astrologer from the "Tempo"!

147
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,973
The s... stars don't lie, General!

148
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,859
- See that we don't become
a laughing-stock!

149
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,813
I shall inform parliament, anyway.

150
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,976
You may go!

151
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,089
That astrologer guy must disappear!

152
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,818
That's task no.1!
- Yes, Sir!

153
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,810
- No, John!
Dear God, you mustn't die!

154
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,733
- I say, why the hysterics?

155
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,292
- You go and mind your cannon!

156
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,099
- Who's playing John?

157
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,172
- That slightly idiotic friend of yours,
the stick-in-the-mud.

158
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,491
- Really, Gugenheim's not as bad
as all that...

159
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,614
- They ought to mummify him
so that he doesn't rot in that mud.

160
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,572
And do you know what's happening
on the first night?

161
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,855
- Hm. A dress rehearsal.

162
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,214
- Mr. Steiner gets married
to Miss Molly Adams!

163
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,734
- But I've told you that I don't want
to get married!

164
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,812
- Oh you do, but you're too shy
to say so.

165
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,097
We'll invite five to six people:
Evelina, stage director Brant,

166
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,455
that Oatis of yours, my neighbour...

167
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,054
- Hample? That astrologer?
- Yes.

168
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,735
He's a terribly nice man!
He loves me, he mends my fuses

169
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,931
and he brings me fresh bread rolls...

170
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,932
Anyway, why, can't I ask
whom I like?

171
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,250
- Yes, of course, and see you ask
somebody who'll marry you!

172
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,808
- Oh but Robert...
Now then, do you love me of don't you?!

173
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,414
- I'm really not in the mood today!

174
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,977
- Evelina!

175
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,293
- G... good afternoon.

176
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,450
I want to t... talk to you, if I may.

177
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,815
- Can't it wait, Mr. Hample?

178
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,734
- No... it's... it's about...
...about the wedding!

179
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,613
- So you know?

180
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,652
- The stars told me!

181
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,857
Ho... how do you know?
- But what?

182
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,450
- That... we're going to get
ma... married!

183
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,218
- What do you mean, we?!
I'm marrying Mr. Steiner!

184
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,497
- Ah, I see, ye... yes, that's...
That's correct.

185
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,219
We'd live together, all three of us!

186
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,218
- Can you please tell me

187
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,699
how you imagine that would work
in practice?

188
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,610
- To tell you the truth,
I thought it a bit odd too...

189
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,018
...but it's what the s... stars say
and th... they don't lie!

190
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,888
- Per... perhaps we'll all get on well
to... together.

191
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,096
Molly!
Will you come and help these people,

192
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,216
they're looking for a certain
Mr. Hample!

193
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,372
- Can I help you?
- You're that fortune-teller guy?

194
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,578
Called Hample?
- Ye... yes.

195
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,492
Our Colonel would like to know
if his wife'll be having a boy

196
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,059
or a girl.

197
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,810
I'm sorry, I...

198
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,693
Is that him?

199
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,659
Sorry! But you s... said...
...that I'm to find out what...

200
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,458
what... what... what's to be born!

201
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,217
- Nothing's to be born,
on the contrary, if you ask me!

202
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,328
Tie him up so he doesn't dodge about!

203
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,129
- So that was just a j... joke,
about th... the baby?!

204
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,738
- I don't get it, he's so calm!

205
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,015
Like blooming calf!

206
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,016
You see I know that my fr... friend's
co... coming, to save my li... life.

207
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,491
Sure thing...!

208
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,418
Some spares, Your Highness.

209
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,255
- Delightful. Thank you.

210
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,339
- Hope it keeps fine for you, Oscar!

211
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,378
- Couldn't you lend me
that Hample bloke for a few days?

212
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,020
I'm preparing some proposals
for parliament.

213
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,819
- The astrologer?
Of course.

214
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,778
- I'm sorry, but that won't be possible,
Your Highness.

215
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,373
Poor Hample passed on yesterday.

216
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,018
Something fell on his head.

217
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,657
- Hample is dead?

218
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,930
Don't do that in my presence, you know
that I can't bear the sight of blood!

219
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,817
- Sorry!

220
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,335
- I want to say this:

221
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,058
I got you out of a hole...

222
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,089
...but under one condition!
That it's kept under our hats!

223
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,617
- But Major, I'm a soldier,
I know all about top secrets!

224
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,013
Steiner, see they bring that Hample's
charts and maps to my flat -

225
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,613
I'm an antique collector.

226
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,089
- And have you verified it?

227
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,411
It's unbelievable!
Thank you.

228
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,209
The Neurology Institute has just asked
for the brain of that Hample chap!

229
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,129
- The brain of an astrologer of genius,
General. -

230
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,008
They'll preserve it in alcohol.
- Bravo! Gentlemen...

231
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,329
- Hample is dead
and now nothing will stand in our way!

232
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,331
- Only after that prophecy of Hample's

233
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,456
not even a mouse can slip
through to the King!

234
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,780
- I would take it upon me to propose
a certain plan.

235
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,532
- Go on.
- It has one disadvantage. -

236
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,497
It's too expensive!
- Never mind.!

237
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,219
We have the State Treasury
at our disposal...

238
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,658
- There is one person

239
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,614
who is received by the King
at any time of the day or night.

240
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,135
Evelina Keletti.

241
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,499
- But she won't murder the King!
- She will!

242
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,052
The permit to enter prison hospital.

243
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,496
- Ah yes, Mrs. Stubb!
This way.

244
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,415
She got the noose, but she's damned
lucky- she's dying - her liver!

245
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,056
About two more weeks and that's the end!

246
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,098
Here it is.
She's just got a visitor.

247
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,577
Can't you give up!
And you'll have to pay for that ball!

248
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,652
And this is what you would look like,
Mrs. Stubb!

249
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,219
- Jesus! Crikey!

250
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,929
- Just a mo!
I've seen that woman somewhere.

251
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,736
Show me! Damn you!
- Don't you touch it!

252
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,570
Well, Mrs. Stubb?
Hm...?

253
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,178
- Why ask?
Of course I will!

254
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,009
- Well really, Fanny,
surely I have something to say too!

255
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,249
Because if she's going to look like
this bird,

256
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,296
then I'll be wanting my bit of fun!

257
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,291
- And what would you be wanting
to do with me, you good-for-nothing!

258
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,848
- Hm...
Just normal like...

259
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,455
- Poor fool.

260
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,973
- I don't want to deny you a thing,
Mr. Bloom.

261
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,618
You can come any time you like.

262
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,854
Holy mackerel that dope gets
on my nerves!

263
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,896
- Steiner...
- But it's my own fault!

264
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,732
I botched it when I slit his throat.

265
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,970
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, show the gent you scar!

266
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,129
- The one where you botched it
when you tried to slit my throat.

267
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,812
- Yeah. Here.

268
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,813
And what about those other cases?

269
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,051
- My husband I bashed up
with a frying pan.

270
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,415
- You're a widow?
- Yeah. A widow.

271
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,413
And then there was
the forest ranger,...

272
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,899
...the organist and the bartender.

273
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,815
Four murders in all,
all sadistic.

274
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,416
I just said "Close your eyes,
sweetie-pie!" and slit!

275
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,008
Blood, that's my hobby, and gold, too!

276
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,377
You also stole, Mrs. Stubb?

277
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,815
- Yeah!
Like this.

278
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,020
Was it gold?!
- It was.

279
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,329
- Just imagine, Mr. Strauss,
that's how she pinched

280
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,775
a golden ladle this big,
in one of the museums!

281
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,378
Boy, did we have a time
trying to get it out afterwards.

282
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,575
I covered you that time,
at the museum, what?

283
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,413
- What about popping out
for a glass of rum Mr. Bloom?!

284
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,693
- Well, yeah, I could do that.
And I'll bring back

285
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,010
a drop for you too,
Fanny girl.

286
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,896
Mrs. Stubb, would you be capable
of killing just anybody?

287
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,335
- If it's a man...

288
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,299
- It'll be a man, Mrs. Stubb!
- It will it?

289
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,331
- And then you'll get a heap of money,
a plane ticket to South America,

290
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,216
and you can live it high!

291
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,733
But one other thing!

292
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,099
They said you'd last another two weeks,

293
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,015
but can't wait that long, Mrs. Stubb!

294
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,976
Come here!

295
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,335
Stick these labels onto these two boxes.

296
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,732
On the left, that's the astrologer
Hample, on the right the Stubb woman.

297
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,610
Send the left box
to the neurology institute,

298
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,339
take the right hand box personally
to Professor Somer's clinic.

299
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,093
There are brains inside those boxes,
take care you don't mix them up!

300
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,898
- The left to the neurology institute,
the right to Somer!

301
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,136
- To Professor Somer!

302
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,936
Right, the left to the neurology
institute, the right to Somer!

303
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,336
- Are you Somer?

304
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,572
Well O.K., Professor then.

305
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,059
I've brought the brain,
that Stubb woman's brain.

306
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,613
Would you please sign for it?

307
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,812
- I say, that's some brain!

308
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,209
You didn't get it mixed up
with another one, or something?!

309
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,858
- Well, really...!

310
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,771
- Let's hope not...!

311
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,219
- Professor...

312
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,059
- You are a tormentor, Professor!

313
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,212
- One must suffer for the sake
of beauty, madam.

314
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,019
- You certainly haven't suffered much
in that respect, Professor!

315
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,809
It's setting!
- Well, yes...

316
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,732
Would you kindly close your eyes?

317
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,458
- Yes.

318
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,213
We'll prise you out of your shell
in a few minutes' time!

319
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,212
Didn't she find it fishy?
- No. Thanks.

320
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,338
I told her it was a new face
and body mask.

321
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,012
And the mould is complete.

322
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,898
But anyway, why all this secrecy?

323
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,172
- She's to shoot
some dangerous sequences

324
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,137
and wants to do it herself,
without a stand-in.

325
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,213
The King is naturally worried
and has ordered a double to be made.

326
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,729
- Yes, I understand,

327
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,380
the sequences will just
have to be filmed without her knowledge.

328
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,178
- Yeah.

329
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,772
- But if it's such a top secret,
I can't very well ask for normal...

330
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,294
...that is to say human, material.

331
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,098
Is there any other possibility?

332
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,419
You can make your choice, the body can
either be made up of veal or of pork.

333
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,858
So. What are you staring at?!
A beauty parlour, see!

334
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,212
Who did the stomach?

335
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,779
- I did, Sir.

336
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,532
- I could have guessed!

337
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,738
What on earth made you put in
a rumen, third stomach, and maw?!

338
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,812
She'd ruminate, you somnambulist!

339
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,416
Take care I don't make you unemployed!

340
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,456
Put it right!

341
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,499
She must have been really brainy,
Professor!

342
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,494
Look at this, it's as big
as a man's brain...

343
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,411
- Yes, I noticed that, too.

344
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,173
- And who was this Mrs. Stubb?

345
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,775
- I don't know, but in any case
she must have been a woman

346
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,055
of quite unusual intelligence.

347
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,256
- Evidently had great acting talent.

348
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,854
- Well that doesn't signify
great intelligence!

349
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,250
- If she's to play double
to Evelina Keletti...

350
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,017
- I beg your pardon?
There now. Finished!

351
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,856
Well, gentlemen...

352
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,693
I think that we can be satisfied,
gentlemen!

353
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,139
Fantastic!

354
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,778
- Perfect job!
Right down to the last freckle!

355
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,413
- Is she alive?
- We left that job for you.

356
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,772
You're going to breathe life
into the body, like God the Creator!

357
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,379
- I?
- Yes.

358
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,140
Consider it a little mark of favour.

359
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,329
Just like mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

360
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,018
H... h... how d... dare you?!

361
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,138
- Just normal, a bit of shock, that's
all. Look, how beautifully she stutters!

362
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,249
Who did the vocal chords?

363
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,138
- I did.

364
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,497
- Take care I don't make you unemployed!

365
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,973
Well, Mrs. Stubb, you're back
on this earth!

366
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,338
- How come how come
I've g... got this?

367
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,651
Where on earth did a chap
like me get this?

368
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,819
Chap... Chap...

369
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,774
You're a woman and we don't expect
much logic, but surely, Mrs. Stubb?

370
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,737
- Do... don't call me Mrs. Stubb!

371
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,618
And g... go away, how can you bother
a chap in this st... state of undress!

372
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,930
- Chap?
Come now, get hold of yourself.

373
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,375
Get used to it O.K.!

374
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,451
Never mind, you'll settle down in time.

375
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,930
- And what are you doing here,
S... Steiner?

376
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,837
- There now, you know this gentleman,
don't you? Your memory's coming back!

377
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,828
You've got some clothes for her.
There's a spare wig over there.

378
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,230
It'll be better if we leave,
she needs quiet.

379
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,914
Lots of luck, Mrs. Stubb.

380
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,915
- I'm no M... Mrs. Stubb.

381
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,957
They killed me, didn't they!

382
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,270
- They had meant to hang you,

383
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,158
but you died of your own accord
at the prison hospital, Mrs. Stubb.

384
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,038
- Holy mackerel!
Will you stop it!

385
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,674
And these w... will have to go
t... too!

386
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,193
After all, I'm no woman!

387
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,352
- Oh yes you are,
take a good look!

388
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,710
- But...
But this is E... Evelina Keletti!

389
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,957
What is this supposed to mean,
S... Steiner?!

390
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,120
- Well then I'll explain all over
again.

391
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,510
You're Fanny Stubb,
the widow of Ignatius Stubb...

392
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,318
- What?

393
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,993
A widow? I'm a wi... widow?

394
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,911
- But of course you're a widow!

395
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,153
- Well in that c... case
ev... everything's O.K.

396
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,151
- That's fine then!

397
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,674
- If I'm a widow
then I must h... have these too.

398
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,639
Widows do.
Well, c... continue!

399
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,919
- And now, Mrs. Stubb,
why have we given you back your life...

400
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,356
You are now going to undertake
your fifth murder.

401
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,317
- Right.
- What?

402
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,429
What? I'm to ki... kill somebody?

403
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,155
- But of course.
The King!

404
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,038
You said:
"As long as it's a man...!

405
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,590
B...
- Never mind him, that's the cook.

406
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,318
What is it, Bobo?
- Some man's waiting downstairs.

407
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,879
Such a...

408
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,476
- Just a moment, Mrs. Stubb!

409
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,354
Excuse me, Mrs. Stubb!

410
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,718
- One minute!

411
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,712
- Good evening.

412
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,110
- That's better! Well, I've come,
that was our agreement...

413
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,197
- Ah yes.
You're quick, aren't you!

414
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,154
Well, never mind. At least Mrs. Stubb
won't be bored tonight...

415
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,316
This way.

416
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,591
Well now, isn't this a surprise,
Mrs. Stubb?

417
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,515
Come, come, come, come!

418
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,989
- Christ, Fanny
you're a sight for sore eyes!

419
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,075
Who's that?
- Oh but you know him very well,

420
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,515
Mrs. Stubb.
Just as soon as you remember!

421
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,791
I'll lend you a pair of pyjamas!

422
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,916
- What's that?
- Pyjamas.

423
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,919
- Oh, I see.

424
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,914
- But I don't want to stay here
w... with him!

425
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,631
- No wild orgies, mind,
the chef's bedroom is below!

426
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,079
You can burn those pyjamas
in the morning!

427
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,031
- G... go a... away!

428
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,439
- Stop stuttering and take off
those glad rags!

429
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,795
I said take off those glad rags!

430
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,118
Did you hear, you so-and-so!

431
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,670
When you were an old nag
I was good enough, what?

432
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,512
And now I'm not to touch you, what?

433
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,948
- St... stop pawing me about,
you p... pig!

434
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,996
- You're so choosy all of a sudden!

435
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,555
Look...
Well.

436
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,599
Look here! Got a pail?

437
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,831
- There's w... water in there.
- Now then, come on!

438
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,354
Where's that pail then?!

439
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,629
Fanny, what's this hissing noise?

440
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,196
What sort of stupid joke is this?
Cripes!

441
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,798
What son-of-a-bitch
thought up this?

442
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,553
Ha, just look at the bright laddie -
fresh out of Sing-Sing!

443
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:54,589
You...
You damned old moll!

444
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,669
A cell all over again, or what?

445
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,591
You think you can get away
with dousing decent people

446
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,789
and thingummy...

447
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,348
Open up, will you! Open up,
I'm no chick,

448
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,398
I've got out of a different kind
of cell in my time!

449
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,593
I'll show you...!
- As you like - I don't feel anything.

450
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,715
Hm.
Like a couple of animals!

451
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,435
We won't be getting much sleep tonight!
- Let's hope

452
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,909
he doesn't break her or something!

453
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,037
- It's young, fresh veal.

454
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,675
- Now I'll show you who's master!

455
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,196
- How do you do, I'm H... Hample!

456
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,034
- Just a mo! Look here, you bitch,
I'll tear you apart I will! You...

457
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,639
...you old duffer!

458
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,751
I'll set that new trap of yours
back into shape, you...

459
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,791
Bobo!

460
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,432
Bobo!

461
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,273
- You're b... bats, B... Bobo!
Stop it!

462
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,318
You've had one sp... spot of trouble
with that s... sword already!

463
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,152
I'm S... Stuart!

464
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,517
Do you re... remember when I told you
I'd become a wi... widow?

465
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,759
Well, h... here we are!

466
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,710
- Wha... what - Stuart?
- I'll explain!

467
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,672
What goings-on!

468
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,475
That's no villa, that's a brothel!

469
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,917
- But Alfred, Steiner is a young man
full of temperament...

470
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,916
And I'm to open negotiations with such
rake about a real estate sale...!

471
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,349
You should warn that Molly of yours,
so that she knows she's marrying!

472
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,148
- Love is love...

473
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,518
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

474
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,637
- Stop! What a bit of luck!
- I beg your pardon...!

475
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,075
- Come here, I'll tear you apart
and chop you up, I will!

476
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,992
- Alfred!
- Alfred!

477
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,354
She's got an Alfred now...!
- Alfred!!!

478
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,919
- What's going on here?!

479
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,117
- So you've got a new guy again?!
Fast worker, you are!

480
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,470
- Away with you my man
or I'll have you arrested this minute!

481
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,437
- You take care old chap,

482
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,953
I've got some right to this bird too!

483
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,519
For five years I rounded up
all the fancy jobs for her,

484
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,999
and I sat in the clink in her place,
too!

485
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,115
And she's suddenly gone hoity-toity
on me!

486
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,950
- Police!

487
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,637
Police!!!
- I'm coming, Mr. Keletti!

488
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,514
Get out, you scoundrel! There!

489
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,475
- You wait, Fanny, I'll beat up

490
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,073
that freckled fanny of yours for you!
You...!

491
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,909
Freckled...
You undressed in front of this man?

492
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,830
- Well, really, Alfred...!

493
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,795
- I can see that you haven't told me
everything by far about your past!

494
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,156
- Don't be disgusting!

495
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,876
Where now, Mr. Keletti?
- First to the bank

496
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,792
and then about that real estate
to that...

497
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,911
...Steiner's!
- Yes, Mr. Keletti.

498
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,230
- The sun has hidden its countenance
behind the bulk of Mount Yve!

499
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,880
The hour of your death has arrived!

500
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,353
- Stop!

501
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,073
Stop! That's enough!

502
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,397
Christ, Gugenheim, what are there for?!

503
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,478
- Well really, I thought...

504
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,949
- Oh I see, you thought?

505
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,152
But you never think, so will you kindly
not break that rule at least!

506
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,539
What are you doing
after the rehearsal?

507
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,611
- I've got a date with the King.

508
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,817
- Listen, Evelina, be a dear and invite
the King to my wedding, will you?

509
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,454
You see...
- Why not ask him yourself?

510
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,412
I'll arrange a royal audience for you.
- Well, shall we continue!

511
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,892
Start again from "Goodbye, friends!"!

512
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,931
- Goodbye, friends!

513
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,659
Long live good old England!

514
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,218
- Let not a drop of blood be wasted!

515
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,336
John!
- Untie them!

516
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,331
- No!
You will die too. And first!

517
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,099
Stop!

518
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,536
Who put the live ammo in there?!
Props, here to me!

519
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,769
Listen, you, I'll have you arrested!
Do you know what could have happened?!

520
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,014
How are you feeling, Madame?
- Evelina!

521
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,533
- Are you all right?

522
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,849
- He... he cou... could have
ki... killed me!

523
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,018
- Shock!

524
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,851
I think that means we've finished
for today!

525
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,894
Damn it!

526
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,499
- He said you're not to get close
to the window!

527
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,614
And not to out into the garden
before nightfall.

528
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,134
I say, isn't this wrong or something?

529
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,771
Yes, that's better!
That looks more like it.

530
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,772
- And wha... what do I do with this,
B... Bobo?

531
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,573
- I don't know, I'm not a girl!

532
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,458
And I only studied
at the Military Academy.

533
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,415
Got a s... safety-pin?
- Yeah.

534
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,938
Doesn't that hurt?

535
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,338
- No.
H... how do we work it t... tonight?

536
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,099
- As soon as Steiner locks everything up
and goes into his bedroom,

537
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,849
I'll get a ladder up,
you climb down and we'll disappear.

538
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,131
- You... you're running away
wi... with me, Bobo?

539
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,257
- Yeah. I don't want to have
anything more to do with Steiner.

540
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,455
- Bobo!
- Lo... look here,

541
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,575
don't do that... get away from me!

542
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,810
- D... don't be idiotic!
This is nothing

543
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,128
but a hun... hundredweight
of v... veal!

544
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,814
- That's just the thing, and I'm a chef!

545
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,055
I'll brush it out for you!

546
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,457
Put that thing out!
Quick!

547
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,336
My name is Keletti.

548
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,894
- Mr. Steiner is... not...
- Show me those clothes!

549
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,217
- Oh no, you'd soil you hands,
they're messy and crushed!

550
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,770
- Thank you, I've seen quite enough!

551
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,217
- Peggy! Peggy!

552
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:32,411
Just imagine Alfred,
I made a great buy today!

553
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,979
Isn't it beautiful?

554
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,778
You gave the servants the day off?
Why?

555
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,412
- Wait and you'll see why.
Where have you been?

556
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,458
Ah, what a day this has been...

557
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,695
Nothing but excitements
and thrills all day long!

558
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,612
- Really?! But I can see
that your clothes are cleaned up!

559
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:06,173
The thrills you experienced on the floor
or directly on the dung-heap?!

560
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,615
- What are you saying, Alfred?

561
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,328
- You tell me!
Tell me of the fun you had with Steiner!

562
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,369
Who is better, that stinking tramp
who knows all about your freckles,

563
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,253
of Steiner, who wipes his feet on you?!

564
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,492
I haven't been to Steiner's flat
in my life!

565
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,298
- That you have! And naked!

566
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,174
- Why are you so offensive?
You know that I'm incapable of lying!

567
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,693
- You...

568
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,859
You...

569
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,969
You... incapable of lying?!
You snake-in-the-grass!

570
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,893
Ouch!
- Alfred, did you hurt yourself?

571
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,690
My conscience is as pure as fallen snow!

572
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,095
- You unscrupulous monster!

573
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,413
You tramp's concubine!

574
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,733
What's the matter with him?

575
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,534
- Nothing.
- Come along home!

576
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,693
- Don't do that, Mr. Keletti!

577
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,008
- You there, kick that chair away,
will you!

578
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,939
Don't do it!

579
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,330
We should have that repaired,
Mr. Keletti. It could kill somebody!

580
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,698
Take that chair away
or you're fired without notice!

581
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,136
- But it's quite unnecessary,
Mr. Keletti!

582
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,817
- I have killed my wife, I want to die!

583
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,017
- That woman looks the very image
of your late wife...

584
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,299
- What do you mean by that?

585
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,816
- Well. If we manage to lure her
in here, you'll be in the clear!

586
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,088
I've got a ladder ready, Mr. Keletti!

587
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,250
- A ladder?
- You can depend on me!

588
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,818
Do you see the likeness?

589
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,258
- Stuart, listen, that's settled,
right?

590
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,291
I'll come and get you
through the window.

591
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,537
Damn it, stop smoking! -
What if he walked in here...

592
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,451
- Hell!

593
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,493
Will you kindly not do this!

594
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,808
But its so ho... hot in here.

595
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,211
- You'll be paying a visit
to the King tomorrow.

596
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,213
You'll be given your directions
and the knife in the morning.

597
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,171
Good night!

598
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,098
- These damn si... silly tricks
of yours, Bobo?! Bo... Bobo!

599
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,210
Stuart!
Stuart!

600
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,211
Where are you, damn it all?
Steiner's fast asleep.

601
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,009
Come along, we've got to go!

602
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,016
- ... men have more resistance.

603
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,011
But if you give a woman a good sniff,

604
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,811
she doesn't wake up
until she's in kingdom come!

605
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,338
- What do you mean "kingdom come"?

606
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,217
- Obvious.
We'll turn on the gas!

607
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,376
And in the morning the whole world
will hear that you wife

608
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,257
committed SUICIDE...

609
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,615
And you'll be a widower,
but not a murderer!

610
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,009
- Thank you. I'll never forget
what you've done for me!

611
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,452
Where on earth did that Steiner
find such a perfect duplicate?!

612
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,688
Poor girl! Now she'll find the corpse.

613
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,058
Is there anything wrong?

614
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,570
There must be -
Madam wants her tea with rum!

615
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,733
Excuse me.

616
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,575
Do please have a little understanding
for our jobs!

617
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,492
Please don't be angry, but the public
wants to be kept informed.

618
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,695
Wants to know how Mrs. Keletti
is feeling.

619
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,929
- After that shock she received
yesterday at the theatre!

620
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,535
- Excuse me, gentlemen!
Could I talk to her?

621
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,252
Impossible! My wife isn't...
...isn't quite herself this morning!

622
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,575
- I quite understand.

623
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,491
I was present when it happened
at the theatre yesterday.

624
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,215
But... Please understand I must
talk to her! The premiere's approaching!

625
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,580
I'm telling you for the last time
that she's unconscious

626
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,179
and that I refuse to let you in!

627
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,618
Excuse me... - Madame for the "Tempo".
- For the "Express"!

628
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,011
- Madam, don't forget
the premiere!

629
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,177
She didn't even recognize me! -
It's more serious than I thought.

630
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,339
She take my car!

631
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,139
- Follow her!

632
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,733
I heard that you have suffered
a bad shock, madam.

633
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,936
- Th... that's not im... important
just now!

634
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,932
- Of course.
Of course.

635
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,372
Well, and what would you be willing

636
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,020
to pay for those maps?
- A... anything.

637
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,059
- Surely not anything?!

638
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,050
Anything I may ask for?
- Everything.

639
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,734
- But for a man of my temperament

640
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:15,014
that can mean but a single thing,
madam...

641
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,618
This body of mine is not of fir...
...first-rate importance to me.

642
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,813
- But it is to me!
I've been longing for you for years!

643
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,379
I dream of you!

644
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,170
- No... no kissing!

645
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,495
- My word, that's substantial underwear
you're wearing my dear...!

646
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,259
How does one take them off?
- I d... don't know!

647
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,132
And interesting model!

648
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,455
Who's the visitor?
- Some reporter.

649
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,936
It's nothing but work, work, work
at our place Gerti.

650
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,019
Ah...!

651
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,296
A bit of masochist, what?

652
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,250
Do y... you like ve... veal?

653
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,210
- Why?
- Nothing. Just a question.

654
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,650
We'll talk later,
O.K.?

655
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:54,849
I haven't experienced such a thrill
for years, madam!

656
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,850
No, Gerti, that doesn't matter a bit,
even if he is working!

657
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,489
Omar would never forgive you
for not dropping in.

658
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,775
This way.
- Oh!

659
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,658
- Ugh, Omar!

660
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,574
You should be ashamed of yourself!
This is the end between you and me!

661
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,019
- Who's that?

662
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:17,014
- Don't you pretend that you
don't know me, you... You slut!

663
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,976
- Here she is!

664
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,336
Come on in, quick!

665
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,211
- Dear God, Mary,
we must be sensible!

666
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,733
- Sensible?!

667
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,011
- Couldn't you at least put on
your clothes?

668
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,610
We must keep this quiet, Mary!
My career's at stake!

669
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,497
- Keep it quiet you may,

670
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,810
but it means an end to my love!

671
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,891
- Keep it quiet you may,
but it means an end to my love!

672
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,336
- ... an end to my love.
- Oh!

673
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,610
- General! Words fail me...!

674
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,259
- What do you all want in here?!
Out, immediately!!!

675
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,808
- Excuse me, but I've got a press card!

676
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,376
Your wife has just broken up my home!

677
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,576
- Oh madam, I wouldn't take it
as hard as all that!

678
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,452
You know that these artists have
a different sort of set of morals -

679
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,689
they are like birds.

680
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,254
- Bu... but the ma... maps are mine
now, aren't they?

681
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,649
- How's that?
How's that?

682
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,097
- But you... you un... undressed me!

683
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,968
- But you know that we didn't
get as far as...

684
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:31,212
- Well then everybody go a... away,
so that he can undress me!

685
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,973
- Oh!
- This is unbelievable!

686
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,891
- You see Madame Keletti
is an antiques collector

687
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,493
and she wanted... My maps.

688
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,372
- I wouldn't take it so hard!
- Nor I!

689
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,098
- You know these collectors...
They have a different set of morals -

690
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,694
like the worker-bee. Isn't that right?

691
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:48,769
- How could you make such shameless use
of my wife's passionate nature?!

692
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,408
I'm no... no wife of y... yours!

693
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,492
He wanted to turn the ga... gas on me!

694
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,815
- Please don't forget
that she has experienced a shock!

695
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,132
You must convince her that she's
your wife! Otherwise - prison for you!

696
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,859
- But of course she's my wife!

697
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,048
This will mean a duel!
- A duel! Oh!

698
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,653
- You overdid that!

699
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:12,692
- You see, Omar, a duel!
Because of some maps...

700
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,411
- Well, do I get undressed or...
- Christ, no!

701
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,250
Dear God, do understand my situation...

702
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,296
- Be quiet! This is the end
between the two of us!

703
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,251
Gerti will be my witness at court!

704
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,568
- Mary,...
- At court? Oh!

705
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,059
- Why take it to court, madam?!

706
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,698
Why break up a family,
the very foundation of society?

707
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,736
Look here, why don't you two
shake hands.

708
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,731
- I ne... need those ma... maps!
Come on, let's go into the next room,

709
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,253
maybe we'll manage to get these things
o... off if we join forces!

710
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,377
- Great God, that's enough!
You can keep those damned maps,

711
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,020
and get out!
Everybody out!

712
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,370
- We don't get out,
it's you who gets out!

713
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,928
You lecher!
The villa belongs to me!

714
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,294
After what has happened
I assume you must realize

715
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,690
that this can end only in one way-
catastrophe.

716
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,659
- We'll have to get rid of her-
the sooner the better!

717
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,889
Let her have those charts or she'll
tear the house down!

718
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,379
- We must set our plans very cleverly!

719
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,690
She's gone. Disappeared!

720
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,770
- This is a very dangerous situation!

721
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,816
- The woman's a notorious murderer!

722
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,613
If she kills someone, it'll be our end!

723
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,089
- They'll catch her and she'll blab!

724
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,859
- The King will disband the army
day after tomorrow!

725
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,168
And then he'll have it out with us!

726
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,093
Leave it!
Thank you, Steiner...!

727
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:34,248
- If he's dead he won't be able to have
anything out with us...!

728
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,578
I am willing to lay down my life
in this cause.

729
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,292
I shall break into his bedroom and...

730
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,251
- And, and, and, and... What?

731
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,896
- I know how this must be done!

732
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,488
I had been looking forward
to my wedding very much indeed,

733
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,056
gentlemen, but I am willing to sacrifice
anything for our cause!

734
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,535
My fiance Miss Molly Adams
has been granted an audience

735
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,258
with the King toady at one o'clock.

736
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,252
- But that means that she would die to!

737
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,735
- There's nothing to be done about that!
- Jesus Christ!

738
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,015
- That's the only possible solution.

739
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,096
- I... is that you, B... Bobo?

740
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,179
S... Stuart.

741
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,250
Wh... what's that you're saying?
Molly Adams?

742
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,419
No... no I don't understand you!

743
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,419
Listen carefully, Stuart!

744
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,695
They want to do Molly in,
do you understand?

745
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,892
The King and Molly!

746
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:28,217
I didn't hear the end.
But you're an astrologer, aren't you...?

747
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,259
Hm.

748
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:47,138
Explosion, wardrobe department.

749
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,098
Wardrobe...

750
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,977
One o'clock, explosion...

751
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,019
Bring me an aspirin
and a glass of water!

752
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,016
It'll be quite easy!

753
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,219
But how?

754
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,733
This is the way!

755
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:32,897
I'll be waiting downstairs
and you'll ask her in here.

756
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,290
I'll call her to the window
from the garden,

757
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,612
you'll have the kindness to step
on that loose parquet and that's that!

758
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,696
Death by misadventure!
- Let's hope it works out his time!

759
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,418
- We'll have to test the plan!

760
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,056
Hey, what are you doing there?!

761
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:01,136
Mr. Keletti!
Mr. Keletti!

762
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,819
- What is it?
- She's running away!

763
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,051
Just look up there, to your left!
- Hold her back!

764
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,896
Mr. Keletti...

765
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,218
Come along in, I'm just having a bath!
- Mo... Molly...

766
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,815
Come along into the bathroom,
don't stand out there in the hall!

767
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,209
I phoned your house a few minutes ago
and the secretary told me

768
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,249
that your husband had something wrong
with his head. Just a migraine, maybe?

769
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,657
- Yeah.
A migraine.

770
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,090
- Be a dear and scrub my back, will you?
- Yeah.

771
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:03,296
- I'm to be at the palace in an hour
and this is the state I'm still in...

772
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,779
I'm so nervous

773
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,612
that I'd much rather not go there
at all.

774
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,019
- Don't go! Do... don't go!
We... we'll stay here

775
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,660
and I... I'll gi... give you
your b... bath.

776
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,852
- Are you mad?! I had a new dress
made for the occasion...

777
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,493
Do you know what, why don't you go
and have a look at it?

778
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,093
- And what about he... here.

779
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,294
- No, thanks.
- And your t... tummy!

780
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,336
- That's enough!

781
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,937
Listen, what's wrong with you?!

782
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:46,018
- Go and take a look at that dress,
you're keeping me!

783
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:52,299
How am I to address the King, -
Your Highness or Your Royal Highness?

784
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,810
- You're no... not going to see
any King!

785
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,896
- Yes, I'm walking,
it's such a little way

786
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,499
it's not worth taking the car!

787
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,212
- No, I w... won't let you go!

788
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,417
- Why not? You arranged the audience
for me yourself!

789
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,411
- You're st... staying put!

790
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,219
- What on earth has got into you
today!

791
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,415
Surely you're not jealous now...?

792
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,094
Give me that key!
- No... no I w... won't!

793
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:25,014
- Evelina!
- There!

794
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,015
The jealous bitch!

795
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,133
Mind! Here they are!

796
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,659
Now!

797
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,613
Oh!

798
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,930
Can't you be more careful, man?!

799
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,652
Our apologies, madam!

800
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,935
We'll set this right this very minute.

801
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,333
The shoe!

802
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,089
When is it timed for...
- In five minutes.

803
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,659
Go!

804
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,459
Taxi!

805
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,412
Taxi!

806
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,614
What's the hurry, Fanny!
We've got something to settle first!

807
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,299
There now, now you won't run out on me,
you...

808
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:49,769
You bitch!
Wait! Wait!

809
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,537
Help! Help!
- Sorry.

810
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:01,097
- N... nothing happened! Taxi!
- Sorry!

811
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,573
I am quite exceptionally happy
to meet you.

812
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,892
Madame Keletti has often been
telling me about you.

813
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,417
She is as unusually wise
and witty young lady.

814
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,009
And I have a great respect
for her opi...

815
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,214
Don't you hear something ticking
by any chance?

816
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:26,538
- Le... let go! Le... let go!
Un... un... get undressed!

817
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,217
- I?
- Molly!

818
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:34,378
- M... Molly, get un... undressed!
Come here! Come here! Come here!

819
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,532
- Good heavens, Evelina...
Have you gone mad, God, are you crazy?!

820
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,418
- Y... your dr... dress! Wait!
- Leave me alone!

821
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,897
Madame Keletti...!
- Don't take my dress!

822
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:47,095
- Now the, Mrs. Keletti,...!
I know you want to please me.

823
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,699
But at such a price, surely...

824
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,329
The girl will catch cold!

825
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,775
- Dear God! Please turn round,
Your Highness!

826
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,055
- M... Molly, come on! Come on!
- Yes, of course.

827
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:59,010
Madame Keletti,
really this just will not do...!

828
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,415
Do realize what would happen
if the Prime Minister walked in...!

829
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,815
- Ouch!
- Molly!

830
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,817
- Mrs. Keletti! That's enough!

831
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,537
Listen, you must have been drinking!

832
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:12,529
Come here and brea...
- Excuse me!

833
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:14,571
Wh... whoops!

834
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,255
And what do I walk home in...?
- You went a bit far, this time,

835
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,489
Mrs. Keletti!

836
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,453
This get-up gives rather
a bad impression.

837
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:34,254
...you are our last hope!

838
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,217
The King will be disbanding the army
the day after tomorrow.

839
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:44,169
Anyway, they do say
that you're a better shot then actor!

840
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,417
- How dare you...!
- But I'd be capable of making you

841
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,979
the first tragedian in the land,
do you understand?! -

842
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,937
Othello, Hamlet, Romeo,...

843
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:55,817
...Picasso! Or manager of this theatre,
or Minister of Culture - anything!

844
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:01,012
- But a King, that's no small matter...!

845
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,213
Regicide...

846
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,580
- It won't be you,
it'll be the props man!

847
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,218
- What do you mean, the props man?

848
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,779
- You know what happened
at the rehearsal!

849
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:18,219
There'll be "misadventure" again -
a live bullet...!

850
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,930
Did you say theatre manager?

851
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,215
I thought she'd gone crazy!
And just imagine,

852
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,770
in the end she climbed over the balcony
in Mr. Hample's flat.

853
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,849
- Hample's flat?
Hm.

854
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,854
But how could Mrs. Keletti have know
what was afoot?

855
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,895
- She's rather queer nowadays
altogether.

856
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,898
- What do you mean, queer?

857
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:51,128
- She keeps looking at me
in such a moon-struck way...

858
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,293
And she stutters!

859
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,698
- What?!
- Miss Molly onstage!

860
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,532
- She stutters?

861
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,699
- But the king was wonderful!

862
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,533
Just imagine, he accepted my invitation
to attend our wedding!

863
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,451
Are you glad?
Bye-bye.

864
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,936
Professor Somer?
Steiner.

865
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:20,170
Would you be so kind as to borrow
the brain of astrologer Hample

866
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,410
from the neurology institute?

867
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,809
I am of the opinion
that the man's alive.

868
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:30,012
- You were right,
some error must have been made.

869
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,008
This is definitely a woman's brain!

870
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,209
The Stubb woman. Fanny Stubb.

871
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,694
All right then,
but where is Hample running around?

872
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,451
Don't you worry about that.

873
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,300
And that'll be the end of you,
Stuart Hample!

874
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,417
It's veal! - Surely we won't
throw it out...

875
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,900
Any way, do you know how much
such a wedding feast comes to?

876
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:03,219
- All right! In that case let's put
a veal joint on the menu...

877
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,496
And we can make soup of this.

878
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,419
- And what else?

879
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,019
- And then we could have
some veal knuckles,

880
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:13,537
or ragout, or aspic...
It's make a beautiful aspic!

881
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,376
Will you kindly step back, Major,
or you'll get blood all over you!

882
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,014
- Wait! You know that I can't
bear the sight of blood!

883
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,615
My God, your disposition, Man...

884
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,019
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Well! O.K.!

885
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,339
- My dr... dress, B... Bobo!

886
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,459
- Take it! There's your dress, take it!
Yeah.

887
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,138
Well. Wait - fasten this on!

888
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,812
As witness at the wedding
you have to have it.

889
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,710
Bon appetit!
- Thank you.

890
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,398
What a pity the King had to go away.
I heard that veal knuckles

891
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,311
are his favourite speciality.

892
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,513
- You seem to be in a marvellous mood
today, madam! Your health!

893
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,279
Hey!

894
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,789
Sorry.

895
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,713
- She's trying to forget the loss
her husband!

896
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,117
- I'm just as badly off in that respect
as you are, madam. There. -

897
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,399
All alone.

898
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,272
What do you say we both change our lives
from the very foundations?

899
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,789
What do you say to that?
- I... I'd sure need that...

900
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,911
...you don't know how!
- Cheers!

901
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,830
I'm really thinking of getting married
again!

902
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,913
I've made an appointment for you
this afternoon with Professor Somer

903
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,558
about that stuttering of yours.

904
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,752
He says he'll put you right by the time
the evening performance starts!

905
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,717
- Th... that makes me
a h... happy woman!

906
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:01,238
I shall be watching your performance
from the Royal box, dear Evelina!

907
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,120
- Maybe it would be better
if you were to sit elsewhere...!

908
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,597
- W... why should you sit
el... elsewhere?

909
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,238
- Oh that was just a little joke!

910
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,318
Do you remember what happened
when General Stollwerk got married?

911
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,831
- I heard that he got married
in a submarine

912
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,951
and that they ran out of air
in the middle of the marriage ceremony!

913
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,918
An editor once got married
in a balloon

914
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,596
and they le... left the I... load on.

915
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,316
When they were over the pond
they began to sink

916
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,675
and they h... had to throw out
the pri... priest!

917
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,479
You made that up, madam!
- No! No! No!

918
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,068
That happened to one of o... our staff
at the "Te... Tempo"!"

919
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,038
- You on the staff of the Tempo?
I know it was a joke!

920
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,310
- All actresses like making up stories,
don't they?

921
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:47,469
- Not only actresses!
Opera singers, soubrettes...!

922
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,354
Listen, man, you must have killed

923
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,158
the real Mrs. Keletti
for the wedding feast!

924
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,433
- Do you think so?

925
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,199
- This is the Hample guy!

926
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,315
- But then, in our line of business
things are different,

927
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,879
one soldier with too much imagination

928
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,393
can cause the whole regiment
to fall apart...!

929
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,948
- I personally do not have
any great faith in dreamers either.

930
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:10,113
But I do appreciate a bit of imagination
in women and in cooks.

931
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,869
You have an excellent chef,
Madame!

932
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,550
The ve... veal is delectable!

933
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,471
The fork slides into it like butter!

934
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,558
- I had meat prepared in this fashion
only once before in my life.

935
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,589
That was on Quadapulpo.
- But they are cannibals!

936
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,708
- Perhaps you are a cannibal
and don't even realize it!

937
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,753
Yes, Sir?

938
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,751
- You've got me into a fine mess,
my man!

939
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,831
We've just eaten a famous actress,
understand?!

940
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,435
And the General wanted to marry her!
- But he had three helpings!

941
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,709
- We're cannibals
and that's against the law!

942
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,108
- What do you mean to do?

943
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,716
- There's only one thing left for me
to do!

944
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,593
- Where are you go... going?

945
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,028
- Why do you ask, Stuart Hample?

946
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,196
- W... why is Oa... Oatis to sit
else... elsewhere?

947
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,111
What are you planning
at the th... theatre?

948
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,996
Well that's one thing you won't get
to know!

949
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,554
Bobo!
B... Bobo!

950
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,917
- You scoundrel, it's all your fault
that we ate up Mrs. Keletti!

951
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,954
- She's going to haunt you,
all ch... chewed up as she is!

952
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,591
Swing at him!

953
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,039
- Swing at him!

954
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,157
Damn it, swing at him, will you!!!

955
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,270
Calm down, Madame! Professor Somer
has managed greater miracles!

956
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,789
- Of course.
But how did it happen?

957
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,913
- A bit of bad luck.
He was combing his hair and...

958
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,713
- Hm, hm.

959
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,119
Can you save him?

960
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,959
- If he lived through this,

961
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,234
then certainly!

962
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,231
Will you please follow me, Madame,

963
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,237
this little stuttering trouble of yours
will be set right by my first assistant.

964
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,753
He's an expert on vocal chords.

965
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,718
It is all a matter of just
a few minutes, Madame.

966
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,633
Set the lights!

967
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,158
Vocal chords are no problem!

968
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,759
There is a total of fifteen
in the human being,

969
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,034
the squirrel only has two

970
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,315
and that explains why there is
such peace and quiet in a forest.

971
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,039
Excuse me.

972
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,992
You sure finished him off,
you boffin...!

973
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,790
Take care I don't make you
unemployed...!

974
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,916
- Poor little Molly,
she'll go out of her mind for grief!

975
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:37,954
- This means the premiere's off

976
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,679
and I've got a ticket...!
Take it away!

977
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,720
I th... think this could still be
settled some w... way or other!

978
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,910
W... wouldn't it be a pity of Molly
were to be done out of a hu... husband

979
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,549
and you out of your p... premiere!
- And what do you suggest?

980
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,036
Si... simple - give my brain
to S... Steiner

981
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,910
and put that o... one in he... here!

982
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,358
And what you would do in a man's body
I can't imagine, Mrs. Keletti!

983
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,234
I'm n... not the Ke... Keletti woman
at all!

984
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:18,751
It's me, S... Stuart Hample!
And this is veal!

985
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,068
You'll sa... save yourself having to do
another o... operation!

986
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,909
That lady is sure n... not to stutter!

987
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:36,678
Can you tell me,
why is it taking so long?

988
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,320
- Three and a half hours
isn't that long, Sir!

989
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,710
Finish this off!
How are you doing?

990
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,319
- Practically finished.

991
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,909
- And now breathe life into her!

992
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,911
I don't want to get
a slap for my trouble!

993
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,912
Don't you worry,

994
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,511
that was quite a different matter
when Mr. Hample was waking up to life.

995
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,275
Here we can assume
that this Mrs. Stubb was a lady,

996
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,430
and that she'll behave accordingly.

997
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,717
She'll be taken aback for a little
while... We must be tactful!

998
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,516
Come here, you with glasses!

999
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,518
So you feel like having it out
with the old Stubb girl?!

1000
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,717
- Just you calm down, Mrs. Stubb!
Calm down, please!

1001
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,871
Help me please!
Help me!

1002
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,632
Do stop it, Mrs. Stubb!

1003
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,591
He's a family man, has two children!

1004
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,511
- No! No! No! No!

1005
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,593
Pull yourself together!

1006
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,399
Did you see that show
of sexual temperament,

1007
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,038
that insatiable personality?

1008
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,874
That must have been some bird!
- Is this possible?

1009
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,439
- Just you calm down, Mrs. Stubb!

1010
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,313
You have now become a young
famous actress,

1011
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,518
your name is Evelina Keletti
and you're a widow.

1012
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,548
- Evelina Ke...
...Evelina Keletti.

1013
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,596
- Listen, do you have any
stage experience?

1014
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,069
- Yeah.
- What sort of part?

1015
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,516
- A toadstool.
When I was at kindergarten.

1016
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,789
- And say you were now to play
the role of a Goddess

1017
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,429
who slits people's throats in a Temple,

1018
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,796
do you think you could manage?

1019
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,838
- Close you eyes sweetie and slit!

1020
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,592
- Well then, that's fine!

1021
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,716
You can go and get dressed!

1022
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,878
Open up the clamps!
That's right!

1023
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,872
Excellent work.
- So we saved that young actress's

1024
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,313
marriage.

1025
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,469
- Yes. Only that now
she'll have an astrologer

1026
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,357
for a husband
instead of a major.

1027
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,792
- Won't she be surprised when she finds

1028
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,348
that her husband knows a whole week
in advance what's to be for lunch.

1029
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,193
- Or with whom she'll be having
an affair next year,

1030
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,759
except that that'll be less pleasant
to know!

1031
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,399
- For him or for her?

1032
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,557
- Stop rattling on and breathe life
into the chap!

1033
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,192
Finished!
Yes.

1034
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,475
Well laddie, let's have a look at you!

1035
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,595
Mind! It's fresh!

1036
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,149
Where's M... Molly?

1037
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,876
Listen, Stuart Hample,
I just realized

1038
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,993
that you got yourself a really fine wife
and scot free!

1039
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,758
Well, Steiner, are you all right?

1040
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,717
- Y... yes.
- Excellent!

1041
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,119
Mind you're at the theatre in time,

1042
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,191
the King must disappear tonight
at any cost!

1043
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,754
- I beg your pardon?

1044
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,638
- But the King...
After all, it was your idea!

1045
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,518
- General, Mrs...

1046
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,474
...Keletti is perfectly all right
again.

1047
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,553
But now it's Mr. Ham... er... Steiner
who's stuttering for a change.

1048
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,756
- Never mind, Professor,
the main thing is he's alive!

1049
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,319
Thank you!

1050
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,310
Dear Evelina!

1051
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,750
I'd like to take you home to your villa
now, if you'll permit me.

1052
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,074
- Well knock me down
with a feather! I've even got

1053
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,309
a house!

1054
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,834
And who are you supposed to be?
Is this gold?

1055
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:58,317
- The actress in you will out! -
That voice, that elocution!

1056
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,870
- Elocution!
Elocution!

1057
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,276
Listen,
who was that Stubb woman actually?

1058
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:17,636
Good gracious, that's some barn!
- Barn!

1059
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,752
Evelina, you're a treasure!
A treasure!

1060
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,796
How many hidden facets your talent has!

1061
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,519
- What does this guy want?
- Excuse me.

1062
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,952
Before I leave the house
as the very last member

1063
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,029
of its former staff,

1064
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,917
I would like to tell you
one thing, General.

1065
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,555
I know nothing of this woman -

1066
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,915
but it is not she!

1067
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:43,113
Your deceased husband's secretary was
evidently crazy!

1068
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,634
- What if some damned fool barges in
on us again?

1069
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,948
- No, no, no, my dearest!

1070
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,357
We are alone at last!

1071
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,913
- That's fine!

1072
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,355
What about stretching out on the sofa?
- I beg your pardon?

1073
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,116
- Lie down!
- Gladly! Evelina, gladly!

1074
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:10,355
Come here, Evelina,
last time it was so madly...

1075
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,399
...so madly thrilling!

1076
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,517
Come, my angel, we'll be in paradise
in a minute!

1077
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,598
- Sure thing!

1078
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,557
Take that tie off so that I can get
at your neck!

1079
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,639
My neck!
Ah, I adore that!

1080
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,113
What's that - ticking?

1081
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,155
Close you eyes, baby!
- My beloved!

1082
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,553
Thi... thi... this is Hample,
Bobo!

1083
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,518
Come to the th... theatre at once!
There are c... conspirators there!

1084
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,716
But hu... hurry!

1085
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,594
What is it?!
- How on earth are you driving?!

1086
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,279
How on earth are you driving??!!

1087
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,915
Ah, it's madam!
- Where's there a theatre round here?

1088
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,072
I don't want to miss my cue -
I'm to slit some people's throats!

1089
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,469
Show me!
- You're right in front of the theatre!

1090
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,039
- That?

1091
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,116
- Hey! Hey!

1092
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,837
Miss Molly...
...or I should say Mrs. Steiner,

1093
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,997
your husband called - he's quite
all right again, and he'll be coming!

1094
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,319
- Thank you.
- She'll be my ruin!

1095
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,479
But when that Keletti comes I'll...
- Here she is!

1096
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,993
- Hell!
Stinking hell!

1097
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,798
- I was just saying that I was worried
you wouldn't be coming!

1098
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,914
- I'd have to be daft to miss
such an opportunity!

1099
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,513
Hey, don't touch!

1100
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,111
No sign of the stutter!

1101
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,639
But I think you have a slightly lower
timbre.

1102
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,516
So this is what I'm supposed to use
to finish the people with?

1103
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,199
- Listen, do hurry up
or you'll come on late! You'll miss it!

1104
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,840
- Your shoes!
- Look, kitty, I'll miss you...

1105
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,915
Joking apart, Evelina! And do hurry,
we're starting in a minute! Right?

1106
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,556
Where's Oatis?
- I have no idea, Your Highness.

1107
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,552
But he'll be sure to arrive
for the performance,

1108
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,995
he wouldn't miss Mrs. Keletti's
performance for the world today!

1109
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,510
They became engaged today!

1110
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,433
- Engaged to Oatis, that idiot?

1111
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,511
- That's how it is, Your Highness.

1112
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,432
That woman belongs
to the psychiatric ward

1113
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,112
not on stage!

1114
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:24,677
Where do I find this bird?
- On stage.

1115
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,550
- Just a tick!
Where's that?

1116
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,633
- Over there.

1117
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,670
So what?
- The column, it was there yesterday!

1118
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,354
- Really, and where?
- Here it is!

1119
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,913
Come on, chaps!
Come here!

1120
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,074
In that place where you say "The hour
of your death has arrived!"...

1121
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,720
- Yeah!
- ... draw out the pause, will you!

1122
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,029
And what's the ticking noise?

1123
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,076
- You'd do better to tell me
whose throats I'm to slit!

1124
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,628
Or doesn't it matter?
- How can you be in the mood

1125
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,676
for joking now? Really!
Go on!

1126
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,196
Madame...
- Now?

1127
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,510
You dare spit at me,
you pig!

1128
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,308
Let us turn to God, dear friends!

1129
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,831
This is the end!

1130
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,956
- I fear the worst,

1131
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,517
I have a feeling that John is dead!

1132
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,958
- No, John!
Dear God, you mustn't die!

1133
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,519
- Molly!

1134
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,072
- If you are dead,
I want to die with you!

1135
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,113
- That John is evidently hidden
inside that column!

1136
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,918
My goodness, how naive!

1137
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,510
- Quiet!
Here they come!

1138
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,755
The sun has hidden its countenance
behind mount Yve!

1139
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,518
- What?
- The hour of your death has arrived!

1140
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,758
You shall die!
- Me? Bullshit!

1141
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,718
Thirsty!

1142
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,118
Now you're supposed to say
"You shall die!", madam!

1143
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,033
- Ah!

1144
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,074
You shall die, Madame!
- No!

1145
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,509
- Ha, you wait and see!
You're in for a eye - opener, Missy!

1146
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,510
- An interesting conception...
- Very informal.

1147
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,268
- You mean to sacrifice us
to your Gods...

1148
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,110
- Curtain!

1149
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,671
- Reconsider!
- Enough!

1150
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,829
Curtain!

1151
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,148
- Stop screaming at me, you poor sap!
- Great Ra,

1152
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,390
the Sun God, thirsts for your blood.

1153
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,517
- That's good!
- He is also the God of Rainfall!

1154
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,518
- What does he send down?

1155
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,713
I see.

1156
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:36,512
In return for your blood
he will send down rain

1157
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,516
to dampen our ever- thirsting land!

1158
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,597
Stop gaping and get some beer!

1159
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:48,789
I thought this takes place in Egypt!

1160
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,631
- Maybe the stage director wanted
to express some new thought this way!

1161
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,279
- Hardly.

1162
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,073
What did the tickets cost us?

1163
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,469
- Nothing.
- And a good job, too.

1164
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:03,714
- Long live good old England!
- Stop!

1165
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,111
Goodbye, friends!

1166
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,549
- Let us proudly stand
and bear the thrust of the blade.

1167
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:11,311
- Ah!

1168
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,993
Not a drop of blood will be...

1169
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,159
Wasted!
- Hi!

1170
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,117
- Hi!
- Hi, Koko!

1171
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,113
- You... chump!

1172
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,710
You...!
- Koko!

1173
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,113
Come on, come on...!
Don't be stupid! Don't be stupid!!!

1174
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:39,630
Excuse us.

1175
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,280
- Koko, come on climb out
of that drum,...

1176
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,874
- But then it's not so bad as a comedy.

1177
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,598
- It's supposed to be a tragedy,
Your Highness!

1178
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:51,313
Out of the way!
- John!

1179
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,992
- What's up?
- Untie her!

1180
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,912
- Not blooming likely!

1181
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,999
- You'll die too,
and you'll be the first to die!

1182
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,949
- Oh, that one?
Come on, puss!

1183
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,395
- Untie those ropes!
- Come along!

1184
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,238
Throw that stuff away!

1185
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,076
There's a neck for you!

1186
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,757
Oh! Maestro!

1187
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,800
Close your eyes, sweetie!
- But Mrs. Keletti,...

1188
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,631
Good!
But a bit naturalistic.

1189
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,994
Didn't I say the woman is crazy?!

1190
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,800
She slit his throat
as if it were a chicken!

1191
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:46,233
Gugenhaim's dead, start out on plan "B"!

1192
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,150
Lights!
Lights!

1193
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,594
Where are we going chaps?

1194
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,791
Your Highness is all right?
- The King had disappeared!

1195
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,111
- They've abducted him!
- Don't panic!

1196
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,674
Don't panic!
- Let me go!

1197
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,433
That old hen in the hole down there
said he's to die first!

1198
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,795
So why did you drag me down here
in the first place?

1199
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,759
You... goons!
Are you all dumb or what?

1200
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:25,718
Hey!
- Just a moment, you are?

1201
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,193
- The sixth infantry regiment
from Ivancice.

1202
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,991
The King is at the given spot!

1203
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,911
- P... pardon?
- Plan "B" has come off!

1204
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,996
- What... what is "plan B" supposed
to be? I've f... forgotten.

1205
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,476
- But that was your idea!
The King is now...

1206
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,840
Where is the King?!
- D... don't be a nut, Bobo!

1207
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,558
I'm S... Stuart!

1208
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,989
And I was ju... just about to be to...
...told where the Ki... King is!

1209
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,358
- Sorry!
But how was I to know

1210
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,398
that you... er... moved again?

1211
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,477
- I f... forgot to te... tell you!

1212
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,993
- Robert!

1213
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,679
Robert!

1214
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:11,070
- Aren't you a lucky guy!

1215
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:15,996
Listen, actually Molly has both
Steiner and you now!

1216
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,357
- The s... stars don't lie, Bobo!

1217
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,513
- We're together at last!
Ale you glad?

1218
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:26,514
- Te... terribly glad!
The only thing I'd still like to know is

1219
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:30,594
"what plan "B" means!"
- You're an astrologer, aren't you...!

1220
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,713
An explosion, a bed!

1221
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,916
An explosion...

1222
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,354
A bed!
This is terrible!

1223
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,830
- But why is it terrible?

1224
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,679
- But...

1225
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,835
A b... bed! Do understand!
- Darling!

1226
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,839
What is it?

1227
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,274
"- Plan "B"!"

1228
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,510
"- What do you mean, plan "B", "
these are somebody's feet!

1229
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,513
There's a man in there!
- Q... quick!

1230
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,956
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

1231
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:32,278
- What idiot put me under the sheets?
Am I a hot water bottle or something!

1232
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,592
- Your Highness! Are you all right?

1233
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,831
- I suppose this was some conspiracy
again.

1234
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,478
Are you involved in this,
Steiner?!

1235
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:45,036
- I... I'm not S... S...
- Stop stuttering!

1236
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,872
What's the time?
We mustn't miss the fireworks!

1237
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,076
- Wh... what fireworks?

1238
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,912
- At midnight - to celebrate
the disbanding of my army.

1239
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,912
Flags, cannons banging,
a hundred and twenty bands!

1240
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,951
The money! And the pla... plane ticket
for South America! You promised!

1241
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,034
- Listen, Mrs. Keletti...

1242
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,873
- Shut up and look here,
if you don't mean to pay up

1243
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,396
all I have to do is whistle! -
Koko's waiting under the window!

1244
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:17,232
- She escaped from a loony- bin!

1245
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,271
- Come on then?!
Well, how long do I have to wait?!

1246
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,759
You said I was to fix one bloke,
didn't you...

1247
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:25,308
Well, I fixed two. -
Two!

1248
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,839
- Mrs. Keletti, you and I have finished!

1249
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,273
- Leave me alone you old geezer!

1250
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,191
- That's the Ki... King,
Mrs. S... Stubb!

1251
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,317
- Mrs. Stubb?
Have you all gone mad?

1252
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,319
Hush! There's something ticking
in here again!

1253
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,559
- Hush!

1254
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,919
That's...

1255
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,154
Koko!
- Steiner!

1256
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:49,753
- Robert!
- Stuart!

1257
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,951
- Robert!

1258
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,795
I hope she had a parachute,
Steiner!

1259
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,548
Your Hi .. Highness,
I'm no... not...

1260
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,077
The fireworks!

1261
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,154
You wait, you bitch,
I'll pull you apart!

1262
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:20,749
The end

1263
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,879
Starring
