1
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,220
Hey, listen. I know I'm not the usual big shot

2
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,350
you're used to dealing with,
but a deal this small?

3
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,000
I can manage on my own.

4
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,430
I've got connection in In-sa-dong.

5
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,900
In-sa-dong is great.

6
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,800
Since it's my first time,

7
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,000
I wasn't sure what to do.

8
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,310
But I'll make sure to give you a fat commission.

9
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,870
Thank you for that.
Let's see the goods.

10
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,280
Sure, sure.

11
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,180
Ahh, now,

12
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,480
this is called the Blue Dragon Tea Cup

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,490
used by the Ming Dynasty nobles.

14
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,090
I hear it goes at 300 million Yen in Japan.

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,760
- How much?
- 300 million Yen

16
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,100
I own this tiny shop,

17
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,300
so I go to China to get merchandise.

18
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,710
Last trip to Guangzhou,
I bought this off an old Chinese man.

19
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,270
Then as soon as I get back to Korea,

20
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,680
that old man gets arrested by PSB

21
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,580
- For smuggling cultural properties
- Oh yeah?

22
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,210
This old man,

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,590
he'd run errands for Japanese scholars during the war

24
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,090
and stashed away a few artifacts.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,990
Not knowing its worth,
he gave it to me for nothing.

26
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,400
Wow, you lucked out.

27
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,100
The timing was impeccable.

28
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,940
At first he didn't want to sell.

29
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,800
Why?

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,610
Some Korean dude

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,670
begged the old man to sell the goods to him.

32
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,080
I was like, 'This is it!'
'This is the stuff.'

33
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,480
So I called higher.

34
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,990
- How much?
- 5 grand

35
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,880
- How much?
- 5 grand

36
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,780
Haha, you lucky bastard.

37
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,790
High-five!

38
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,090
Whoever he was,
what a poor schmuck.

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,100
Let me shake your hand, man.

40
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,400
That's me.

41
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:55,990
What?

42
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,110
That poor schmuck.
That was me, you jerk.

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,970
Wait, wait...

44
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,980
It took me over 2 months to locate the stuff.

45
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,080
Then you showed up,
and I missed it by two hours?

46
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,290
What's this?

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,590
Blue Dragon Tea Cup

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,390
Don't you think I know that?
Where is it?

49
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,990
- At home
- Where?

50
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,800
At home,
at home, home...

51
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,500
I hid it at home.

52
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,400
No one knows.
Not even my wife.

53
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,900
Mr. Chang-In Ghang!

54
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,580
It's the police.

55
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,370
Did you call the cops, huh?

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,950
- Are you Chang-in Ghang?
- Yes

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,120
Chang-In Ghang,
you're under arrest

58
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,630
for violation of cultural protection act.

59
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,520
Where's your warrant?

60
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,570
Show me the warrant.
Where are you taking me? It hurts!

61
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,700
Call it in.

62
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's go.

63
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,500
Check the roof, go!

64
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,800
Man down.
Man down.

65
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,840
Male, mid-30s.
John Doe.

66
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,600
Fell from the roof top during the arrest.

67
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,400
Villain and Widow

68
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,780
You're in 80 km/h zone.

69
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,280
Please slow down.

70
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,780
Turn it down!

71
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,490
Alarm disabled.
Welcome.

72
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,300
I'm never going to see the grandparents again,

73
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,810
not even for the holidays.

74
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,070
I don't know why we keep going.
Dad's not around anymore.

75
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,270
That's enough.

76
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,590
You have to weed the yard after it rains...

77
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,400
Your home is now secured.

78
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,510
Your yard's full of weed.

79
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,670
What?

80
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,270
You need to weed it out to grow something.

81
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,080
We don't grow anything anymore.

82
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,880
We buy everything from the store
with pesticide all over them.

83
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,280
Why do I even bother...

84
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,930
Room Available to Rent

85
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,180
So, Mr. Ghang's never seen the goods in person...

86
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,160
The Chinese who sold the stuff
got caught by PSB for smuggling.

87
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,290
It was just bad timing.

88
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,100
Didn't you guys look into it?

89
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,690
Yeah, we figured out what's going on.

90
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,100
Well, then.

91
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,700
We just bring you the goods,
get it appraised,

92
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,510
And if it is good,
you pay us.

93
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,680
If it isn't, you don't.
What's the big deal?

94
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,510
I believe my boss is entitled to an explanation.

95
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,780
Entitled?

96
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,180
Not that I doubt your abilities,
Mr. Ghang

97
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,090
I just want to make sure if you need any help,

98
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,890
say, more people

99
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,900
No, I don't need more people.

100
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,630
Well, if there aren't any questions,
we'll see ourselves out.

101
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,180
He's paying us 2 million dollars.
Was it so hard to be nice?

102
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,380
Is he really the president of this company?

103
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,380
What do you mean?

104
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,380
Why is he handling things directly?

105
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,980
Is that a problem?

106
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,690
He needs to delegate to his people.

107
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,590
He's too exposed from the start.

108
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,700
He's just really desperate.

109
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,600
He's got a gallery at the headquarters.

110
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,510
He took 10 million from arts
budget behind his father's back

111
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,770
for money laundering and lost
everything in bad investment.

112
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,680
So he needs something to make up for it,
right away.

113
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,580
Pardon me.

114
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,280
My name is Mr. Song.

115
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,380
If you need anything,
please call me any time.

116
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,390
Who's the midget?

117
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,600
Some punk.

118
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,200
Mr. Ha takes him around as his bodyguard.

119
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,510
Show off at the clubs,
you know.

120
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,880
Real mature.

121
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,980
Don't underestimate residential security system.

122
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,890
You can go in and out of a jewelry shop in a minute,

123
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,290
but this takes at least 3 to 4 days.

124
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,590
You look into the security company.

125
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,690
Who's got time to research all that?

126
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,890
Delaying will upset Mr. Ha.

127
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,490
Why should I care,
he hasn't paid me up front.

128
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,200
Can't you just tie them up and go through the house?

129
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,500
It's only a woman and her daughter.

130
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,580
Sure, because when I untie them,

131
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,450
she'll say 'Thank you'.
Just like that. Sure.

132
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,280
Just make sure they won't want to call the cops.

133
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,580
How do I do that?

134
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,090
- You know how.
- Seriously, how?

135
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,790
You know... just...

136
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,190
Must I say it out loud?

137
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,090
What if it goes bad?

138
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,600
I'd have to rot in jail for another 5~6 years.

139
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,500
Chang-In, life is all about preparing for the future.

140
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,500
That requires money.

141
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,100
This is my last chance.

142
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,300
I'm old.

143
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,970
This guy is paying us 2 million at once.
In cash!

144
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,280
Opportunities like this don't come again.

145
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,180
This is literally, 'show me the money'.
'Show me the money!'

146
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,890
How about just 3 grand?

147
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,400
It must be hard for you, too.

148
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,880
Anyone interested in renting my spare room upstairs?

149
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,680
That's not an easy sale.

150
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,480
It's just a room,
in someone's home.

151
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,580
Don't young people look for studios?

152
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,690
Why would kids want to live in your neighborhood?

153
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,990
They want to live in the city.

154
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,280
Mom, I want to get my eyes done.

155
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,480
Mom, please?
Can I?

156
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,390
Please?

157
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,390
Your eyes are just fine.

158
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,190
You're not ugly.

159
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,990
I am ugly.

160
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,790
No wonder I can't get any parts.

161
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,200
You didn't fail your auditions because you're ugly.

162
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,700
It's because you can't act.

163
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,710
I want cosmetic surgery!

164
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,900
I have no money.

165
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,170
You always say that.
Come on, mom.

166
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,680
Please?
Just once?!

167
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,770
- I got no money. None.
- Surgery!

168
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,780
No money. No money.
Your mom never has any.

169
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,900
Who is it?

170
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,810
I'm here to check out your room.

171
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,270
This room is really perfect for just one person.

172
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,990
I don't mean to be rude,
but what kind of work do you do?

173
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,490
What do I look like I do?

174
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,790
Since you came all the way out here for a room,

175
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,800
You probably need a quiet work space

176
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,600
You're right.
I'm a writer.

177
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,780
I see,
what kind of writer?

178
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,680
I write trashy comments on the Internet.

179
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,680
Excuse me?

180
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,080
I'm kidding.

181
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,880
I write novels.

182
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,900
Oh, you're an author.

183
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,990
No, not a big author.

184
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,690
I'm a bit peculiar.

185
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,000
I just can't write in hotel rooms,

186
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,900
and the city is too loud.

187
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,500
This neighborhood is really quiet.

188
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,370
Oh yeah?

189
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,380
Well, the room seems just fine.

190
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,470
Could I trouble you for a cup of tea?

191
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,200
How long does it take to write?

192
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,900
Well, it depends on the book.

193
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,410
This one,
I think maybe about a month.

194
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,570
So you're looking for short-term lease.

195
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,080
Yes, I am.

196
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,080
Wow, you have a nice view.

197
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,090
Hmm?
Yeah.

198
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,590
How are the neighbors?

199
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,560
Do they visit each other often?

200
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,620
No, not really.

201
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,390
They're mostly old folks being concerned.

202
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,990
Here's your tea.

203
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,590
Thank you.

204
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,600
Hmm, this tea is Tie Guan Yin.

205
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,940
You must know a lot about tea.

206
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,380
Not at all.
I just enjoy tea from time to time.

207
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,980
- By the way,.
- Yes?

208
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,290
It's customary to charge two months' rent upfront.

209
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,990
One month rent is impossible to find, anywhere.

210
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,190
You're home.
How was school?

211
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,090
What's this?

212
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,990
Where are your manners?

213
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,100
- I'm really sorry. Excuse me.
- Sure.

214
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,390
What is the matter with you?

215
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,190
Who is he?

216
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,700
He's here to see the room.

217
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,600
That guy? Alone?
Are you crazy?

218
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,000
Who are you calling crazy?

219
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,600
Can't you tell?
He's a writer. A gentleman.

220
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,800
No way.

221
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,840
Why not?

222
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,470
Where else will we get money from, huh?

223
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,570
I can't exactly afford to turn him down.

224
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,580
Well, I don't like him.
Send him back.

225
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,880
Send him where?
Keep it down.

226
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,890
I said no.

227
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,080
He'll hear you. Be quiet,
Seong-Ah Hahm!

228
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,990
Get him out, now!

229
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,680
He stays.
Settle down!

230
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,780
I don't like him.

231
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,190
Be quiet,
Seong-Ah Hahm! Hush!

232
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,290
I don't like him!

233
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,090
I said be quiet!

234
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,600
Oh, you really don't have much stuff.

235
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,670
All a writer needs are his laptop and a desk.
What else?

236
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,180
You're annoying.

237
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,890
Who rents a room to steal a piece of china?

238
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,090
This is the only way to discretely
look for it without the fuss.

239
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,690
I can't afford to get in trouble by tying up those girls.

240
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,610
Do you want the table here?

241
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,770
Oh, you're here.

242
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,870
Shouldn't we sign a lease or something?

243
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,180
Should I ask the realtor?

244
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,680
Oh, no problem.
I don't care if we do.

245
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,790
I just don't want to waste any money on brokerage fees.

246
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,980
I'm only here for two months.

247
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,800
Hey, you must be uncomfortable.

248
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,300
I should show you some ID.

249
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,590
Oh no.
I didn't mean it like that.

250
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,690
No, no.
We should be clear on this.

251
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,230
My publisher says even authors
need business cards nowadays.

252
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,830
Hyeong-Gook Park,
Author Mangook Publishing

253
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,970
- Well, make yourself at home.
- Okay.

254
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,980
- See you later.
- Bye.

255
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,090
Did you get a tenant?
I saw a man.

256
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,590
Yes, I rented out the room upstairs.

257
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,890
A man moved into a house of two girls.

258
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,690
He's a writer.
He writes novels.

259
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:37,300
A man who's a writer moved into a house of two girls.

260
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,680
What's up?

261
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,490
- Um, sir.
- Yes?

262
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,400
- I'm really sorry, but...
- Yeah?

263
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,200
- I've been thinking and...
- Well, ma'am,

264
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,300
I paid you two months' rent upfront, right?

265
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,470
Yes, two months.

266
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,270
Then I have the right to live here for two months, right?

267
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,680
Why, of course...

268
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,490
Did you want to say something?

269
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,580
Um, would you like some dinner?

270
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,290
I only eat fruits when I write.

271
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,690
- How about some tea?
- No thank you.

272
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,700
Well, you should get some rest then.

273
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,700
Okay, then.

274
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,200
Good night.

275
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,270
Who's she think she's dealing with?

276
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,100
I love you.

277
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,790
Seong-Ah Hahm!

278
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,100
- Oh my...
- He's so hot, isn't he?

279
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,300
Look at you pretending like you don't know.

280
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,900
I really don't know.

281
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,100
- You really don't know?
- I don't.

282
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,670
- You went karaoke-ing that time.
- How would I know that?

283
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,770
Then she's all mine.

284
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,810
Let's see who wins this battle.

285
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,580
- You're home early.
- Yeah

286
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,780
It isn't much,
but this is Bolay tea.

287
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,790
I thought you might appreciate gourmet tea.

288
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,490
Oh, thank you.

289
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,390
I haven't tried it yet...

290
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,000
I haven't had that tea, yet.

291
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,100
Oh, would you like some tea?

292
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,700
No, you don't have to.

293
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,710
Thank you.

294
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,870
- Give me a minute.
- Sure.

295
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,290
You have a lot of plants here.

296
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,990
Yeah.

297
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,800
It's interesting to put them on the steps like this.

298
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,270
- By the way, sir.
- Yes?

299
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,180
What kind of story are you writing?

300
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,570
Well, that's...

301
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,890
What I'm writing is...
about a woman.

302
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:58,700
Once she had many dreams.
She was pretty.

303
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,590
But one day,
she looked back

304
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,400
and those days were gone.

305
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,480
This isn't the life she wanted.

306
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,180
She's like my sister,
crying in front of a mirror.

307
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,390
That's what I'm working on.

308
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,280
Speaking of,

309
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,790
Could I come down to interview you sometimes?

310
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,190
Me?

311
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,930
Yes.

312
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,300
I think you're similar to the character in my novel.

313
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,670
Well, I don't have much of a story.

314
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,680
No, no.

315
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,480
Everyone is the main character in their life story.

316
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:56,880
Oh that.
I put up bricks and plastered with cement.

317
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,590
- Cement?
- Yeah.

318
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,690
You plastered the wall with cement?

319
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,400
Yeah, so it's quiet.

320
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,280
- The whole wall?
- Yes, completely.

321
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,990
- Have a seat, sir.
- Okay.

322
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,690
- Well, sir.
- Yes?

323
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,900
I'd hate to bring this up again,

324
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,910
but I asked around and

325
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,100
even a short-term tenant

326
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,370
should pay a deposit.

327
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,380
- Really?
- Yes.

328
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,380
If you can't come up with the deposit right away,

329
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,080
maybe you can pay more rent?

330
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,890
Isn't it like 100 dollars more for every 10 grand?

331
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,590
Well, you're right.
I will get it to you.

332
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,900
Good.
I will write up the lease.

333
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,000
I thought I told you I don't need the lease.

334
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,470
Hey, Seong-Ah.

335
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,980
Sorry about her.

336
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,180
She's going through puberty.

337
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:28,980
No worries.

338
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,890
Not like it's the first time she's being rude.

339
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,690
Where did you learn to behave like this,
in front of an elder?

340
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,090
How would that make me look?

341
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,590
He's hanging out here now?

342
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,500
Don't overreact.
He's just having tea.

343
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,690
I hate him.
Make him leave.

344
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,400
Why are you acting so weird?

345
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,200
He must feel so uncomfortable.

346
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,260
Why are you treating him like he's fecal matter?

347
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,400
How nice,
comparing me to shit.

348
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,070
Why can't you be considerate of others?

349
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,770
Whatever. I hate him.
Send him home.

350
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,180
How come you hate so many things, huh?

351
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,680
Hey, you're still up studying.

352
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,290
I just came out for some air.
I couldn't write.

353
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,090
Alright then.

354
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,000
Here, buy yourself a book.

355
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,470
No discipline around here, huh?

356
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,710
What do you mean,
you can't get through the stairs?

357
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,420
She brick-walled it and plastered cement all over.

358
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,580
And you moved in without even checking that out?

359
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,260
Don't get upset.
I'll take care of it.

360
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,690
We assured them it'll only take 3~4 days.

361
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,090
Tell them to wait a few.

362
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,100
And send me money for the deposit.

363
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,400
Wow, it's really nice in here.

364
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,670
Did you decorate it yourself?

365
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,680
With my husband.

366
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,480
Here.
What you asked.

367
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,980
By the way,
I need to use the Internet for research,

368
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,890
but I don't get Internet connection from my room.

369
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,590
Could I use the computer downstairs?

370
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,690
Well, the computer...

371
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,600
The additional deposit.
Two months worth.

372
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,690
Thank you.

373
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,900
I'll only need to use it for 3~4 days.

374
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,610
That's not going to work.

375
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,300
What?

376
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,580
It doesn't look good if you're
downstairs by yourself during the day.

377
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,180
Well, I'll be quiet during the day.
Who's going to see me?

378
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,690
There used to be some unique items
here when the husband was around.

379
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,790
The husband died in a unique fashion last year.

380
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,590
Did I say something wrong?

381
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,290
It's okay.
You didn't kill him.

382
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,000
If it's Internet fee,
I will pay you.

383
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,600
I even gave you the deposit.

384
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,070
Wait a minute.

385
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,870
I rightfully deserved that deposit.

386
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,580
Come on.

387
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,480
Seriously, I only need a month to finish writing,

388
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,680
but I paid rent for two months.

389
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,880
Then you asked for more deposit,
which I paid.

390
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,890
Still, you won't let me use the Internet?

391
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,590
Nowhere in this country can
you rent a room for one month,

392
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,190
not unless it's a motel.

393
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,700
There's a cyber cafe down the street.

394
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,500
How can a writer work in a cyber cafe?

395
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,000
There are loud kids,
playing games.

396
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,100
Why are you yelling at me?

397
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,270
When did I yell?

398
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,680
It's just the Internet.

399
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,470
Just go to the cyber cafe, go!

400
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,600
It's been a while.

401
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,100
You must be out of your prescription.

402
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,580
It must be half-life.

403
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,280
The pills are not working anymore.

404
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,780
You still can't sleep without drinking?

405
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,190
But I don't drink hard liquor.

406
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,990
I only drink wine or beer.

407
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,890
It doesn't matter what kind of alcohol you drink.

408
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,900
I told you many times.
Drinking every night isn't good for you.

409
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,090
Do you still often get irritated?

410
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:15,690
But, that's not depression.

411
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:21,070
Getting angry with people around you,
saying things you regret.

412
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,670
That can also cause you to feel depressed.

413
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,570
Doctor, please.
Stop staring at me like that.

414
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,050
What?

415
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,880
It feels like your eyes are shooting sharp knives at me.

416
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,080
I know it's rude of me to say,
but your eyes don't look right.

417
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,180
Just when I'm ready to share with you,

418
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,190
I see your eyes and shut up.

419
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,790
I was just walking by and saw,

420
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,890
Jeong-Shim Kim, Psychiatrist

421
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,490
and thought you were a female doctor.

422
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,300
What kind of man has a name Jeong-Shim?

423
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,700
Honestly, if you were a woman,

424
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,400
Maybe I'd feel more comfortable sharing.

425
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,910
But when I'm with you,

426
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,670
I feel like a kid getting scorned by a teacher.

427
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,680
Why can't you make your patient feel at ease?

428
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,080
All you do is criticize and pick me apart.

429
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,580
It's not too late.

430
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,690
Feel free to go else where.
To a female doctor.

431
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,280
And my apologies my family named me a girly name.

432
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,390
Do you angry?

433
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,000
Next time,
try this doctor.

434
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,990
She is really feminine.

435
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,280
Got Milk?
Girl Seong-Ah Hahm Today

436
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,290
Did you put shit in your milk?

437
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,500
Mom, the kids are...

438
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,600
Yeah?

439
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,870
Nothing.
Goodnight.

440
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,970
Go to sleep.

441
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,090
What are you doing here?
What if someone sees you?

442
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,400
How is your writing coming along?

443
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,200
How can I write,
when I can't use the Internet?

444
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,980
- Hey, Mister
- Huh?

445
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,580
- Can you buy me a drink?
- What?

446
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,990
What is your name?

447
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,590
Oh, it's Yeon-Joo.
Yeon-Joo Choi.

448
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,700
Yeon-Joo Choi...
Yeon as in "become" and Joo as in "jewel"

449
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,790
Joo as in "house"

450
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,000
Joo as in "house" because you own the house.

451
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,970
You know, sir.

452
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,480
Do you really think my story can be used for your book?

453
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,080
Sure.

454
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:23,680
I'm not good at logically telling

455
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,490
a story about my circumstances.

456
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,290
No, no, no.
I can totally relate.

457
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,300
I haven't said anything, yet.

458
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,600
Desperation.

459
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,570
Something that desperately asks me to hear you out.

460
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,770
That's hit my imagination.

461
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,080
Hit you?

462
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,280
When did I hit you?

463
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,980
Listen, lady.
You must be my muse.

464
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,590
I will repay you with a great story.

465
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,790
Excuse me.
I have to go to the restroom.

466
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,790
Okay.

467
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,770
How long to copy this?

468
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,080
I'll try to be back by dawn.

469
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,380
That's too late.

470
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,080
Just keep her occupied.
You're good at it.

471
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,290
I got married straight out of high school.

472
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,390
No wonder...

473
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,600
I thought it was weird you have a kid in junior high.

474
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,300
Thirty-five.

475
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,900
I'm an oldie in her mid-thirties.

476
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,880
So weird.

477
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,510
Koreans just love it when you say
they look a year or two younger.

478
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,570
If they love looking younger so much,

479
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,580
let's count our age the exact way,

480
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,380
like they do in European Union.

481
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,690
Then you can be in your early thirties.

482
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,390
Early thirties.

483
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,890
Feels different, right?

484
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,000
You're really good with words.

485
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,560
You know, us writers,
we keep a hundred,

486
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:20,300
no thousands of thoughts in
our heads to get one thing out.

487
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,570
- You're like a con artist.
- What?

488
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,280
Nothing.

489
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,290
Hey, here.
One more.

490
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,790
It goes in,
but keeps getting errors.

491
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,290
I know,
but I'm in a hurry.

492
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,090
What, depression?

493
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,390
At first,
I couldn't figure out what I was feeling.

494
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,610
It was all so sudden,
new emotions. I was going crazy.

495
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,270
I know.
Steel doesn't get rusty overnight.

496
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,880
It takes a lot of time,
being exposed to sun,

497
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,890
and getting rusty by rain.

498
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,590
Sometimes, even washing dishes
seems like an impossible task.

499
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,790
Fatigue.
Simple routine life.

500
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:19,100
It's easy for homemakers to get depression.

501
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,660
Work out.

502
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,200
Before going to bed,

503
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,100
if you run an hour on the treadmill,

504
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,700
you'll fall asleep like a baby.

505
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,470
I thought this was my interview.

506
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,570
Shouldn't you be listening to me?
Stop interrupting.

507
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,380
I was just trying to help.

508
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,580
Who asked you to help?

509
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,690
Since you're a writer,

510
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,590
I thought you'd be a good listener

511
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,290
But I guess not.
All Korean men are the same.

512
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,600
Any old guy can just tell you what to do,

513
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,800
like they have a license to give advice,
issued by government.

514
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,070
What?
You've never seen a woman smoke before?

515
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,080
- Sir!
- Yes

516
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,980
It's my interview.
Let me do the talking.

517
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,780
Okay.

518
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,110
You know, lately

519
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,280
I can't sleep,
at all.

520
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,690
My body is so tired,
but I can't fall asleep.

521
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,190
But I can't just get up again.
It wears me out all night.

522
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,920
By the time I close my eyes it's already morning.

523
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,290
Then when I wake up,

524
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,390
I feel depressed all over again.

525
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,900
'I should get out of bed.'
'I should shower first.'

526
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,370
'I have to send the kid to school.'

527
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,270
'I have to do the dishes.'

528
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,970
But I just stay in bed crying.

529
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,480
'Here's another terrible day.'

530
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,890
Hey,

531
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,700
Where are you going?

532
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,190
Let's have one more drink.
Just one more.

533
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,390
I've already had too much.

534
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,300
But I'm not done interviewing you.

535
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,600
Later.
Do it later.

536
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,100
What are you doing?

537
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,280
I want to know more about you.

538
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,180
No, don't.

539
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,180
Do you want to know how to slow down time?

540
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,480
You have to experience something new.

541
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,990
Something you've never experienced before.

542
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,490
You're still in early thirties.

543
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,900
Early thirties.

544
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,500
According to EU.

545
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,480
You're still young and beautiful.

546
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,070
I'm beautiful?

547
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,690
Young and beautiful, Yeon-Joo.

548
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,990
Don't be sad.

549
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:44,710
A woman as beautiful as you deserves to enjoy life.

550
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,570
I've been meaning to tell you.

551
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,770
I like how your voice resonates.

552
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,670
I feel like I'm in a bathroom.

553
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,690
Yeon-Joo.

554
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,790
Yes, sir.

555
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,370
Am I late?
Where's the girl?

556
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,780
In my room.
I gotta get back.

557
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,980
Is this why you moved in?

558
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,680
Have your cake and eat it, too?

559
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,480
Bastard.

560
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,090
- Yeon-Joo
- No

561
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,100
Yeon-Joo

562
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,190
I have to go back before she wakes up.

563
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,500
Oh, Yeon-Joo

564
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,370
Sir, I have to send her to school.

565
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,180
Okay.

566
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,480
Yeon-Joo.

567
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,080
See you later tonight.

568
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,490
Promise?

569
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,090
Man, that was close.

570
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,890
Nothing in life is easy.

571
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,390
What are you doing?

572
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,090
I missed you, Yeon-Joo.

573
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,400
Last night didn't happen, okay?

574
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,880
Yes, I found something in the
same shape with different print.

575
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,570
Yes, two.
I'll bring them over.

576
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,000
- Any word?
- Not yet.

577
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,380
They said it won't take long.

578
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,480
Could he be of help?

579
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:34,220
Sir, there are a lot of eyes watching.

580
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,880
Having someone like him come to the office is a little...

581
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,220
He's a hard worker.
Why are you being mean?

582
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,020
I wasn't being mean, but...

583
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,890
Hey, Mr. Song!

584
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,100
Why are you so frigid?

585
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,170
Hey, Seong-Ah.
What are you doing? Be quiet.

586
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,370
I didn't do anything!

587
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,090
Mr. Upstairs

588
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,100
Landlady

589
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,480
Why aren't you in school?

590
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:55,390
Seong-Ah Hahm,
don't you hear me?

591
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,480
Let go of me.

592
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,580
Do I have to get called in to school?

593
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,990
Then don't go.

594
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,990
Then stay out till sundown.

595
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,090
Don't come home and get on my nerves!

596
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,300
I came to get my bag.

597
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,970
Nicely done.
Good job.

598
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:20,770
Don't skip out on your after-school academy!

599
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,610
Your home is now secured.

600
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:11,480
Mister.

601
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,980
I've been so worried.

602
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,790
You weren't around for days,
not picking up your phone.

603
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,100
The door was open.

604
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,800
I'll leave now.

605
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,000
What's wrong with you?

606
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,570
Oh my...
what happened?

607
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,490
I'm not that great a woman.

608
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,180
Ah, Yeon-Joo...

609
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,290
I'm really tired.

610
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,900
I know.
I know what you mean.

611
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,400
No, Yeon-Joo.
That's not...

612
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,800
- Mister.
- Yeah

613
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,700
Don't say anything.

614
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,070
No, Yeon-Joo.

615
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:11,170
It hurts me, too.

616
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:16,080
Yeon-Joo.
You're choking me. It hurts.

617
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,600
So it wasn't in the basement?

618
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,870
I went through everything.
It's not there.

619
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,070
You didn't answer your phone for days.

620
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,480
They thought you bailed and went ballistic.

621
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,380
Don't worry about them.

622
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,980
They want it,
they can wait.

623
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,580
How could I not worry?

624
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:59,190
They kept asking for the address.
You didn't pick up the phone...

625
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,190
Hurry up.

626
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,980
Nothing seems to be missing.

627
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,280
Has this happened before?

628
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,490
No, first time in this house.

629
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:33,290
Any new faces lurking around the house?

630
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,890
No one's home during the day,
so I don't know.

631
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:37,990
Even at night,
not sure...

632
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,400
There's one upstairs.
The writer guy.

633
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,300
Who is he?

634
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:46,600
No, he's not.
Don't worry about it.

635
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,370
How can I not worry?

636
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,970
A man moves in with my neighbor and they get robbed...

637
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:57,880
Why don't you mind your own business?

638
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,580
Where were you during the day?

639
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:01,990
Did you see anybody suspicious?

640
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,990
Think about it.

641
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,580
A man moves into a house with two girls...

642
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,790
then something like this happens.

643
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,600
- Goodnight!
- You, too.

644
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,080
Hyeong-Gook Park

645
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,180
Hyeong-Gook Park, author

646
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,890
No search result

647
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:49,400
Mr. President.
What are you trying to do here?

648
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:55,680
Our people underestimated it
because it was a residential house.

649
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,880
I apologize.

650
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,780
Stay out of grown-up business and

651
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:17,190
go play with your friends,
okay midget?

652
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:23,900
Mr. President.

653
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:26,800
Do you think I don't know how to handle a girl?

654
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,470
Your whole stunt was caught on security camera.

655
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:34,570
If any one of them talks,
your name will come up.

656
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:40,090
A rich kid hires thugs to steal a piece of china...

657
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,490
Your dad will be proud.

658
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,490
Mr. Ghang.
Think of Mr. Ha's position.

659
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,790
Wrap it up.

660
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,400
Mr. President.
Do you really want the Blue Dragon Tea Cup?

661
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:59,000
Yes, of course.
Mr. Ghang, I want it.

662
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:02,770
Then if you'd just let me be as I asked,

663
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,180
it will all be resolved soon.

664
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,380
Why are you being uncooperative?

665
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:15,580
If this is what you want,
let's call the whole thing off.

666
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,590
Don't be like that now,
Mr. Ghang.

667
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:23,190
Just hang in there, okay?
Keep it up.

668
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,790
Mr. Ghang.
Let's go now, okay?

669
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,070
He's the one not keeping his word,
isn't he?

670
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:44,980
I can understand where Mr. Ghang is coming from.

671
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,880
Whose side are you on?

672
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,080
I'm not siding with him.
It's just...

673
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,490
If things go wrong,

674
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,490
it won't be good for the company

675
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,190
Stop it.
Man, you're frigid!

676
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,900
You should lay low until this gig is over.

677
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:01,700
What's this?

678
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,600
Chang-In Ghang

679
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,700
A few years ago,
you did some work with Mr. Kwon?

680
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,170
That was ages ago.

681
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,680
Mr. Kwon is in custody.

682
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:14,280
Everyone is getting arrested.

683
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,870
Dumbasses.

684
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:19,980
You keep stalling,
you'll be caught too.

685
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:24,510
I was planning on leaving the
country after this gig anyway.

686
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,820
You know the kid from back when

687
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,590
he's got a golf club in the Philippines.

688
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,290
He said he'll let me in,
if I brought a few hundred grand.

689
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,990
Wake up.

690
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:38,300
He's playing you.

691
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,500
Mind your own business?

692
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,600
- What?
- What?

693
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:43,200
Should I stay home tomorrow?

694
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,000
Why?

695
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,870
You know why.

696
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,980
To be with me?

697
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,580
You should go to work.

698
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:08,590
Modern women are beautiful when they're at work.

699
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,600
Come here.
I'll tuck you in.

700
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:22,010
And you'll go to work tomorrow.

701
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,700
Okay.

702
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,680
Alarm disabled.
Welcome.

703
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,670
Shouldn't you be in school?

704
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:06,280
Well, how do I say this?

705
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,990
When I was your age,

706
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,690
I didn't want to go to school either.

707
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,600
You can stay there,
you know.

708
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,400
There were some difficult times.

709
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:22,800
Wait!

710
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,270
- Yeon-Joo.
- Hi, sir.

711
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,980
Your daughter is home.

712
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,780
So?

713
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:43,980
Shouldn't she be in school at this hour?

714
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,990
Pay no attention.

715
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:49,390
She'll be fine in a few days.

716
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:50,490
A few days?

717
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,530
No.
In EU,

718
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,130
not sending your kids to school is
considered child endangerment.

719
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,430
Watch yourself!

720
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:04,100
No, as a member of UNICEF,
I must say something.

721
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,410
Send her to school.

722
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,880
That's the right thing to do as a parent.

723
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:13,320
Why did you skip school again?
You made me look bad.

724
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,220
What's going on with you lately?

725
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,020
Since when do you care about my school?

726
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,610
When have I not cared?

727
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:21,220
What other mom drives her kid
to the school every morning?

728
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,820
You wanted to practice driving.

729
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,130
What's gotten into you today?

730
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,430
Don't even think about getting your face fixed.

731
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,090
Fix your personality first!

732
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,770
My face can be fixed,
but not my personality.

733
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,710
Because I was born mean.

734
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,000
Mom, you've got it better though.

735
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,810
You're pretty even with bad personality.

736
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,210
What a thing to say to her mother!?

737
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,510
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

738
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,910
You've never done anything for me.
Why start being a mom now?

739
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,920
Some mothers toss their kids off the balcony,

740
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,580
Because they don't want to raise them.

741
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,590
You should be thankful.

742
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,590
And she calls herself a mom.

743
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,230
I was only nineteen years old.

744
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:14,540
If I hadn't given birth to her...

745
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:17,240
You shouldn't say such a thing.

746
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,040
That miserable bastard.
My father-in-law.

747
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:22,450
I had dreams.
I wanted to do things.

748
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,250
Which is more the reason to focus on Seong-Ah.

749
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:26,950
Send her to school and

750
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,960
I was always by her side when she was little

751
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:33,260
and going on commercial shoots and television.

752
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,760
I thought she was going to become a huge star.

753
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:37,660
She was pretty like me when she was little.

754
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,260
She's still pretty,
just as long as she doesn't skip school...

755
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,730
Yeah, she's pretty.

756
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,330
She's okay,
but her personality is not pretty.

757
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,870
Whenever I saw her father's face in her,

758
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:49,810
I just...

759
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,650
Full of stupid hopes to run a big business,

760
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,740
investing in all kinds of failure

761
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,950
All he left me is just the tiny store.

762
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,650
What am I supposed to do now?

763
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,860
Yeon-Joo, calm down.

764
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:09,760
Just focus on Seong-Ah.

765
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:12,060
We should've bought an apartment building,
like I said.

766
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,930
A house with a yard.
A yard?

767
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,870
When he was obsessed with getting a yard,

768
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,230
I should have stopped him,

769
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,530
And bought an apartment!

770
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:25,140
You know the quarterly financial
meeting at HQ on Monday?

771
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,240
So?

772
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,840
Gallery purchases will be included.

773
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:33,750
Isn't the gallery spending not open to public?

774
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,050
Your father gave the order.

775
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:39,950
Dad?

776
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,660
No one should suspect I touched the slush fund.

777
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,430
Can Mr. Ghang be trusted?

778
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,230
Is the Blue Dragon Tea cup worth it?

779
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:55,040
Yes, it is.

780
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,630
It was in the newspapers in China.

781
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:58,040
I mean,

782
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,950
Can I rely on Mr. Ghang and just wait forever?

783
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,150
I already ate.

784
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:15,360
- A kiss?
- Come on.

785
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:17,860
I'm embarrassed.

786
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:22,530
Really?
A crazy customer?

787
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,540
I know right?

788
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,130
- Hey Yeon-Joo?
- Yeah?

789
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:28,430
I'm writing a really important part.

790
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,940
- Can I call you back?
- Okay.

791
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:32,640
Okay, I'll call you right back.

792
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,440
Why won't it go through?!

793
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,860
Stop texting.

794
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,740
Let me get some work done.

795
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:10,650
Landlady

796
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,350
Who invented mobile phones?!

797
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:22,460
Hello?
Yeon-Joo, I miss you.

798
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,660
You're coming home?
Now?

799
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,460
- What is it?
- What were you spying on?

800
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,750
What do you mean,
spy on?

801
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:55,850
You kept watching.
What did you see, grandma?

802
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:57,960
Who are you calling grandma?

803
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:01,630
Me?

804
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:05,330
Where do I look like a grandma?

805
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:07,430
You're not exactly middle age,

806
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:08,940
so what'd you see, grams?

807
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:10,940
Who cares what I saw?

808
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:13,240
How am I a grandma?

809
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,250
Look!
Look at me!

810
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,050
Let's be careful, neighbor. Damn!

811
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,550
You be careful, son.

812
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,950
Wow, you've got a lot of stuff.

813
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:27,060
What's good for a housewarming gift?

814
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:34,220
How much is this?

815
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,140
That's for me.

816
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,340
That man who moved in your house,
the writer.

817
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,240
What about him?

818
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,350
I let it go then because you said it was okay.

819
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,950
But I googled him.
There was no writer with that name.

820
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:02,550
You can find anyone on the Internet.
Isn't that strange?

821
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,060
He's not a new comer,
but there are no books.

822
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,030
How old is he?

823
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,640
Don't you know?

824
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,140
Are you here to buy something or ask questions?

825
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:19,340
Well,

826
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,680
How much is this?

827
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,090
$250

828
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:30,850
Really?

829
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:35,780
This chunk of metal?

830
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:36,890
It's not even the silver candlestick from Jean Valjean.

831
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,450
Then, don't bother.

832
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,230
I will buy something next time.

833
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:09,950
Hyeong-Gook Park,
Author Mangook Publishing

834
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:21,030
- Yes?
- Is this the publishing house?

835
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,940
What?

836
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:26,350
Oh, yeah.
This is Mangook Publishing.

837
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,150
You're close to your destination.

838
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:42,360
You've arrived at your destination.

839
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,760
Re-routing.

840
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,840
You've arrived at your destination.

841
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:04,350
Entering Mangook Publishing

842
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,650
Mangook Antiques

843
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,160
Hey, Yeon-Joo. You're home early.
My publisher...

844
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:28,030
Show me everything you've written.

845
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,340
You said this place helps you write better.

846
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,840
What's going on?

847
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:35,340
Why didn't you want to sign the lease?

848
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:36,930
I told you.

849
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:40,040
I'm only here for two months.
I didn't want to waste brokerage fees.

850
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,240
Show me your resident ID card, then.

851
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,250
Alright, alright.

852
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,550
Look at me.

853
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,460
Ah, you came from the publishing house, right?

854
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:58,160
I was just borrowing a phone number from a friend.

855
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:02,230
My office is going to officially open in the city next month.

856
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,730
You're going to come, right?

857
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:08,340
- Are you a gigolo?
- What?

858
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:12,240
Have I been played by a gigolo?

859
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,650
No wonder,
you can smooth talk.

860
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,350
Well, guess what?

861
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,650
I don't have any money.

862
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,550
The mortgage on this house isn't paid for.

863
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,960
That one shop?
It's all debt.

864
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,220
- Come on, Yeon-Joo.
- I've got jack.

865
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,260
Yeon-Joo!

866
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:32,160
You're my sapphire,
my emerald,

867
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,220
and my crystal.

868
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,530
Oh, my lovely pessimist.

869
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,950
Mr. Hyeong-Gook Park

870
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:02,350
- So, you're a writer?
- Yes?

871
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:05,870
I'm a big reader myself,
yet I've never heard of you.

872
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:09,530
That name is my pen name.

873
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,040
Is that wrong?

874
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:13,840
- Isn't it a bit strange?
- Like what?

875
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:18,140
You just happened to pick this
town and this house to write?

876
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:21,440
I needed a quiet place to work,
so here I am.

877
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,240
Is that illegal?

878
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:27,650
Wouldn't you find a quiet place
in a temple or by the beach?

879
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,250
Fine then.

880
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,550
Help me understand how a grown
man rents a room for a short-term

881
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:34,960
from a mother-daughter family at their home?

882
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,860
What are you,
the house guest?

883
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,830
You have ulterior motive for being here, right?

884
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,230
Have you nothing to say?

885
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:47,730
Must I say it out loud?

886
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:51,540
The two of you!
You don't look good together.

887
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:58,440
I'm asking you, man to man.
Let go of Yeon-Joo.

888
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:09,060
I want to let go of her, too.

889
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,650
- Let's go.
- What?

890
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,360
Come on,
to have sex.

891
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:54,840
Yeon-Joo.
Just hear me out.

892
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:56,030
There's been a misunderstanding.

893
01:15:58,610 --> 01:15:59,540
Let me explain.

894
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:03,640
Come on.
Don't do this.

895
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:08,590
This is not what I wanted.

896
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:09,850
No...

897
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,650
There's no misunderstanding.

898
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:16,350
I've been thinking.

899
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:23,440
What great romance could a widow like me dream of?

900
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:28,840
Just sex every now and then.

901
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,140
Isn't that right?
At our age?

902
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,640
How old are you, sir?

903
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,740
What do you need my age for?

904
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:48,760
I'm 43,
actual age.

905
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:53,930
What have you been doing with your life?

906
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,440
You googled me.
Is it what this is about?

907
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:00,230
Are these black spots on your hand?

908
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:03,640
Leave it alone.

909
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,540
- Did you dye your hair?
- You're hurting me.

910
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:11,550
Seriously, how old are you?
45? 47?

911
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,850
- Fifty?
- What?

912
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:17,350
Oh my...
you're over 50?

913
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,360
Come on.
I'm not even 50!

914
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:20,760
Holy crap!

915
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:25,060
How'd I end up with an old gigolo?

916
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:28,530
Old gigolo... what?

917
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,830
Yeon-Joo!

918
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,530
December 3, 1967...

919
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:37,340
why am I telling her my Date of Birth?

920
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,610
You're certain the Blue Dragon Tea Cup is in that house?

921
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,450
I'm sure of it.

922
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:46,310
All I need is a day or two.

923
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,050
Come on.
Help me out here.

924
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,650
I want to get the hell out of here, too!

925
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:05,030
Yeon-Joo.
Just talk to me.

926
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:13,840
Regardless, you should go to work.

927
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:16,250
Times like this,
you need to move your body.

928
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,750
Are you doing this because of me?

929
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,950
No, it's not you.

930
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,350
It's because of me.

931
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:28,260
You know I...

932
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:30,960
You know how I've got problems.

933
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:32,970
No, it's all my fault.

934
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:36,030
- I think it's come back.
- No, it's all my fault, okay?

935
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,540
You should go to work, though.

936
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,140
Don't say anything.

937
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,440
I'm not going to school!

938
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:51,840
Fine.
Do whatever you want!

939
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,150
No, Yeon-Joo.
She has to go to school.

940
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:58,950
Go, go to school.
Hey, you. Hey!

941
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,950
No, no, no.

942
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,660
It's not like that.

943
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:06,060
And I'm not a bad guy, okay?

944
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,740
You have to go to school,
and be a better person.

945
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:18,640
Come on, Yeon-Joo.

946
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,340
You have to send her to school!

947
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:26,990
Can we just forget about the two of us?

948
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:35,760
Honestly, being with you makes me feel really old.

949
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,460
It drives me crazy.

950
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:42,630
Stop!
Enough with that old talk!

951
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:46,230
Why am I old?
I'm not!

952
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:48,540
This place is just crap!

953
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:53,540
Don't go to school.
Quit! Go make money!

954
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:56,050
Crappy family,
damn you!

955
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:30,740
Sit down.

956
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:36,850
I had a hard time getting your number.

957
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,550
No one in your class knows your number.

958
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:42,450
I don't give my number out.

959
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,960
Did you know who I am?

960
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:49,330
Of course, I know you.
You always stare at me.

961
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,530
I'm kidding.

962
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:56,130
I saw your pictures on the Internet.

963
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,540
- You were the "Got Milk?" girl?
- Yes.

964
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:00,440
I used to have such a crush on you.

965
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:04,440
I told my mom I wanted to marry you.

966
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,960
You like me,
don't you?

967
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:12,450
What?

968
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:15,750
Yeah, yes.

969
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:18,760
- Why?
- Just...

970
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:19,860
Because I'm good looking?

971
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,840
- Yeah, you're handsome.
- I know.

972
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,140
Um, okay.

973
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:33,740
Here, a present!

974
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,340
For me?

975
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,150
Try it on.

976
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:48,260
Let me help you.

977
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:53,820
- No, don't.
- Don't move.

978
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,130
- Hey, stop.
- Hold still.

979
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,830
I don't want to!

980
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,430
You used to wear this outfit.

981
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:57,970
Stop it!

982
01:21:57,970 --> 01:21:59,800
- You're the "Got Milk?" girl!
- I said STOP!

983
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,430
- Stand still!
- No!

984
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,240
Hey, what are you guys doing?

985
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,140
We're just talking.

986
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:08,940
What'd you say?

987
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,950
Hey, who's hiding back there?

988
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:16,960
Come out! All of you, go home,
before I call your teachers.

989
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,150
You should be studying!
I'll come check on you.

990
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,260
This is going to be blow up the Internet.

991
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:28,230
Forget it.
It's no fun.

992
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,530
Sir, Mr. Song has to go.

993
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,940
What else am I supposed to do?

994
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:34,630
I have to report to my father in 2 days!

995
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:37,640
Like Mr. Ghang said,
what if things go wrong with the thugs? What then?

996
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:41,040
I won't ask you to take responsibility,
so don't you worry.

997
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,650
Mr. Song!

998
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:53,060
Good morning, sir.

999
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:55,750
Can you round them up?

1000
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:58,750
I should have listened to you.
I should have gotten rid of them.

1001
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:01,060
What are you talking about?

1002
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,530
They already know your face.

1003
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,730
I'm about to lose it.
That bitch!

1004
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:09,040
Get it together and stop drinking!

1005
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,250
Who are you?

1006
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,840
Hello, old man?

1007
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,550
Take it easy.

1008
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,330
You know what I don't get...

1009
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:40,540
Why you're doing this to me.

1010
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:47,240
If you keep this up,
the deal's off.

1011
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:49,140
What deal?

1012
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,140
Hey, Mr. Ghang.

1013
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:58,250
If you took the payment in advance,
shouldn't you deliver?

1014
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,350
Money or not, if you want to live,
bring it to me by tomorrow morning.

1015
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,560
What payment are you talking about?

1016
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:06,390
What payment?

1017
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:08,430
Is 50K not money enough for you?

1018
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,530
Do you think all rich boys just hang
out with millions in their pockets?

1019
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:19,140
Sir, let me handle it from here.

1020
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,650
Koreans have a twisted prejudice against corporate heirs.

1021
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,850
If I hadn't met you,

1022
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:34,550
I'd still be having those wrong ideas.

1023
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,050
Hey, you're wearing heels.

1024
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,590
I thought you looked taller.

1025
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,660
Shut up,
you bastard.

1026
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,940
High heels do hurt,
I see.

1027
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:22,030
He's getting away!

1028
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:23,630
Get him!

1029
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:24,730
Hold it!

1030
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:26,340
Stop right there!

1031
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,750
Do you see that, kids?

1032
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:38,850
That's what our Mr. Ghang's been emphasizing,
security camera.

1033
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:42,830
We cannot cross this line, understand?

1034
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,950
Yes, sir!

1035
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:50,330
You got until tomorrow.
No point in running.

1036
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,060
Catching a loud-mouth,
old rat in this country...

1037
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,630
easy as pie.

1038
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:37,240
Where is it?
Where did you hide it?

1039
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:20,760
What are you doing?

1040
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:23,150
I'm trying to kill myself.

1041
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,040
You can't die like that.

1042
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,340
Then how can I die?

1043
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:37,730
What have you got to die for at your age?

1044
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:40,750
Because life is hard.

1045
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:57,560
Here, drink up.

1046
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:03,630
Now, tell me.
Why did you do that?

1047
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,230
Because I am ugly.

1048
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:09,440
Really, that's it?

1049
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,540
Take off those glasses.

1050
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,240
Why?

1051
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,740
Just do it.

1052
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:22,950
Come here.

1053
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,250
Let me see.

1054
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,030
I see.
The glasses are great for you.

1055
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:46,940
They cover up your flaws well.

1056
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:50,840
I was just trying to hide bags under my eyes.

1057
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,450
You shouldn't be thinking about
killing yourself over nothing.

1058
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:02,450
There's a Japanese writer,
Murakami Ryu said this once.

1059
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:04,360
Sex over suicide...

1060
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:06,660
I'm only in middle school.

1061
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:15,140
Cheers.

1062
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:26,940
Confess my love.
Don't confess.

1063
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,650
Confess.
Don't confess...

1064
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:50,940
Go, Mr. Song.
Go!

1065
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:54,630
What is it?

1066
01:31:00,410 --> 01:31:01,040
Mom

1067
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:01,940
Come over here.

1068
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:04,540
What did he do to you?

1069
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:05,640
Hey, Yeon-Joo

1070
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:10,350
What'd you do to my daughter?

1071
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:12,250
What the...

1072
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:21,030
Ugh, my back.

1073
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,130
No, Yeon-Joo.
Don't get me wrong.

1074
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,430
What are you doing, mom?

1075
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:28,240
No, it's not like that.
You got it wrong.

1076
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:33,140
Open up!

1077
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:35,540
- You're wrong.
- You're hurting me.

1078
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:40,650
You're giving me a hard time.
You're wrong.

1079
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:43,750
Ugh, my back.

1080
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:49,150
Listen, there's a misunderstanding.

1081
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,060
Let me explain.

1082
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:53,660
I'm calling the cops.
You can explain it to them.

1083
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:54,830
Why are you calling the cops?

1084
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,330
Why not?

1085
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,840
- Don't call the cops.
- Why not?

1086
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,130
- Just don't!
- Why?

1087
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:02,440
Don't, don't.
Just don't!

1088
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:09,540
Friggin... argh!

1089
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:15,450
How could you do that to a little girl?

1090
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,550
- Do what?
- It's not like that, mom.

1091
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:17,450
You just stand back.

1092
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,960
Hey, you're a real piece of work.

1093
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:23,660
Your kid is having a life or death situation,

1094
01:32:23,730 --> 01:32:26,360
Yet, here you are passed out drunk.

1095
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:29,730
And what do you do?
Wrongfully accuse me?

1096
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,830
What do you mean she was dying?

1097
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:38,240
She tried to kill herself.
You daughter, Seong-Hwa. Okay?

1098
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:40,250
It's not Seong-Hwa.
It's Seong-Ah!

1099
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,450
Why would you want to kill youself?

1100
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:50,750
What is he talking about?
Tell me he's lying.

1101
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,760
Why do you care if I live or die?

1102
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:57,160
You already wish I were never born.

1103
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:02,530
How could you tell her that?

1104
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,830
You did.

1105
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,030
When you got drunk and had a fight with dad!

1106
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:11,940
Come on, Seong-Ah.
You know I'm not well.

1107
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:14,950
What are you,
blame it on the depression?

1108
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:19,640
Do you know why you're depressed?

1109
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,550
It's because your body isn't busy enough.

1110
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:24,350
Women today don't do anything.

1111
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:32,060
Your depression could be cured
by working out every morning.

1112
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:33,160
Don't get smart with me.

1113
01:33:33,230 --> 01:33:35,830
Really, I'm sick of your family.

1114
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,530
Your husband,
Gi-Soo Hahm.

1115
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:42,740
Didn't he kill himself too?

1116
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:47,640
He didn't want to live with you.

1117
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,940
So, he fell off the roof.

1118
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,540
Good job,
Gi-Soo Hahm.

1119
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:57,980
How'd you know?

1120
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:58,850
What?

1121
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:02,360
That my husband fell to death.

1122
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:04,660
You told me.

1123
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:06,460
No, I didn't.

1124
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,030
How'd you know his name?

1125
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:14,040
You.

1126
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:19,030
You killed my husband.

1127
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:22,050
No, no!

1128
01:34:22,110 --> 01:34:24,340
I didn't do it.

1129
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:27,050
Come on,
just hear me out. Stay still.

1130
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,640
You're hurting your kid...

1131
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,550
- Go away.
- I will explain everything.

1132
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:32,060
Stop throwing things.

1133
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,750
Calm down.
I will explain everything.

1134
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:38,060
Don't!
I am sick!

1135
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:39,360
What are you doing in my house?

1136
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:41,130
Stop throwing things.

1137
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,530
Look at me. I'm hurting right now.
Let me explain.

1138
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,130
Why am I here?

1139
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:48,640
Well, because I am a writer.
I'm here to write.

1140
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:51,040
You must have a reason for coming here!

1141
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:54,240
You really want to hear it out?

1142
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:59,910
Okay, do you know of the Blue Dragon Tea Cup?

1143
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,450
It's a tea cup this small.

1144
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,450
I don't know what you're talking about...

1145
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,050
I think you do.

1146
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:08,650
Don't Don't!

1147
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:09,160
- Well...
- Don't.

1148
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:10,250
Get the hell out of my house.

1149
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:13,920
Your husband told me.
He hid it in this house somewhere.

1150
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,630
As soon as I get my hands on it,

1151
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:19,730
I will leave your house,
even if you tell me not to.

1152
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:22,540
I really don't know anything about it.

1153
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:25,340
It's 2 million dollars.
Two!

1154
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:28,040
Mom, let's find it.

1155
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:30,550
With that money,
the store will be okay.

1156
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:32,640
The mortgage will be paid for, too.

1157
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,240
And I can afford my cosmetic surgery.

1158
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,750
Nothing to lose, mom.

1159
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:49,530
Yes, we're keeping on eye on him.

1160
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:03,040
Over there,
get him!

1161
01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:13,050
Get in,
you idiots!

1162
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:28,530
Get closer.
Come on!

1163
01:36:33,510 --> 01:36:35,140
Hurry!

1164
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,550
Turn around!

1165
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,130
Hey you!

1166
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:14,640
You jerk!

1167
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,650
Let go of me!

1168
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,750
Let go of me.
Let go!

1169
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:29,860
Hey hey!
Get in!

1170
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:32,960
Come back here, punk!

1171
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:42,140
So this is the Blue Dragon Tea Cup?

1172
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:44,940
Can we repair it?

1173
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:45,740
No, we can't.

1174
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:49,750
Can we get something similar looking?

1175
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,250
We can't get something like this.

1176
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:55,050
It will have to be of a certain class
to look like a $10 million piece.

1177
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:01,860
I believe Mr. Song took the company car out.

1178
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:02,860
What about it?

1179
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:07,630
We have dozens of eye witnesses and a security camera.

1180
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:10,130
Security camera.

1181
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:13,270
What shall we do now?

1182
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:15,140
You know I'm frigid.

1183
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:16,230
Mr. Cho!

1184
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,640
Well, we can report a stolen vehicle

1185
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:21,740
and make sure Mr. Song doesn't come near the company.

1186
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:23,340
Can't get too wrong from here.

1187
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:25,350
Okay, then don't let him near here.

1188
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:31,550
Then you told me not to let Mr. Song come to work.

1189
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,350
Mr. Song,
Mr. Schmong.

1190
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:35,760
I need to figure out what to report to my father.

1191
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:37,460
Can we draw up some paper work?

1192
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:39,050
You mean,
fix the book?

1193
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:41,730
Yeah, let's give accounting
100~200 grand and go from there.

1194
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:45,230
Then, let me fire Mr. Song first,

1195
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:48,140
and I'll look into accounting.

1196
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:54,840
Is there really no way to repair this?

1197
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:06,460
Now, no one will be interested in your house.

1198
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:09,460
No matter how long it takes,
go through every inch of your place.

1199
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:14,530
I'm going into hiding for a while.
Call me as soon as you find it.

1200
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,140
Go into hiding, why?

1201
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,930
Do I really have to explain that to you?

1202
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:23,630
Don't yell at me!

1203
01:40:24,010 --> 01:40:26,140
Walk me through it,
step by step.

1204
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:37,150
Okay, missus.

1205
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:40,250
I have to hide out,

1206
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:42,350
because I am wanted.

1207
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:45,060
Does that make sense, missus?

1208
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:48,930
Pull yourself together.
It's 2 million we're talking here.

1209
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,230
Without me,
you can't even sell this.

1210
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:55,830
Don't let others take it away from you.

1211
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:57,930
Stay focused!

1212
01:41:01,710 --> 01:41:02,540
I'll be going now.

1213
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:11,750
Hey

1214
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:14,250
What about my car?

1215
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:16,560
Seriously, you're worried about your car?

1216
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:21,620
You really annoy me,
you know that?

1217
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:01,340
He was transferred to holdings, yesterday.

1218
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:04,870
So he wasn't really a writer?

1219
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:07,640
He was a cultural property smuggler.
With a long list of priors.

1220
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:11,640
I know I called you out of suspicion,

1221
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,950
But I never thought...

1222
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:18,460
- What if he...
- Don't you worry.

1223
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,960
He's going to think he got real unlucky and got caught.

1224
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:23,150
He will never suspect you for turning him in.

1225
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:25,860
I did some thinking myself.

1226
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:29,930
Thank you for everything.

1227
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,730
Could I have a cup of coffee?

1228
01:42:32,810 --> 01:42:34,740
We don't drink coffee.

1229
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:36,140
Oh, Okay.

1230
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,640
Did he say anything else?

1231
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,150
Like what?

1232
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:53,150
It's nothing.
Never mind.

1233
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,720
You want us to do all of this?

1234
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,530
What are you saying?

1235
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,340
All of these are ours.
Your dads, okay?

1236
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:09,830
Come on.
Give me a hand.

1237
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:46,540
It's cold.

1238
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:18,870
Seong-Ah, don't come out.

1239
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,630
I was a gentleman to you two.

1240
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,930
Out of respect to your husband,
I offered to split it 50:50.

1241
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,030
I'm really sorry.

1242
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:54,130
By the way,
you must know,

1243
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:57,140
There are security cameras everywhere.

1244
01:45:58,210 --> 01:45:59,640
You were filmed on your way in,

1245
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:03,050
down the hallway,
in the elevator.

1246
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,140
Do you think I care?

1247
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:12,060
Those few minutes on your security
feed isn't going to stop me.

1248
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:20,530
Nice digs!

1249
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:25,240
You got here.

1250
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:32,540
2 million,
my ass.

1251
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:35,040
I got exactly 200 grand.

1252
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:38,040
I know you have a million left,

1253
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,740
So don't even think about it.

1254
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:10,650
What's wrong?
When did this begin?

1255
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:15,250
I haven't been able to sleep.

1256
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:20,560
I haven't slept all week.

1257
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:25,160
I think I'll be fine if I can sleep,

1258
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:29,530
But I feel awful.

1259
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,730
My life sucks.

1260
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:48,940
I know how you feel.

1261
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:55,660
Do you sleep alright now?

1262
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:00,020
Yes, I sleep just fine.

1263
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,230
I don't even take pills anymore.

1264
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:10,540
Bitch, you got better alone.

1265
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:14,640
Can I get a drink?

1266
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:17,040
I quit drinking.

1267
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:22,450
Not fair.
Really, not funny.

1268
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,660
I'm doing okay for now,

1269
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:30,150
But who knows?

1270
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:36,130
I'm sorry for hitting you earlier.

1271
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,340
We can call it even on the china price.

1272
01:48:41,810 --> 01:48:43,930
What china price are we even on?

1273
01:48:44,810 --> 01:48:47,540
Look at you,
so coy.

1274
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:50,850
As soon as the bank opens tomorrow morning,

1275
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:53,040
we're going together to get my money.

1276
01:49:02,530 --> 01:49:04,460
I'm going to lie down here.

1277
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:12,830
I can't move an inch.

1278
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:23,540
Are you hungry?
What do you want?

1279
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:29,350
Your surgery went well, huh?

1280
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:32,160
Not really.

1281
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:34,780
It's going to be fine,
once it settles in.

1282
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,160
It's all settled in already.

1283
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:46,760
Well, the sun will come out again some day.

1284
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,640
It's just life.

1285
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:22,030
Warm milk will help you fall asleep.

1286
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:25,840
Damn, I had just fallen asleep.

1287
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,550
Man, it's loud in here.

1288
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:49,830
So, is he going to move in with us now?

1289
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:51,230
What?

1290
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,840
You know,
we have to split it in half,

1291
01:50:54,410 --> 01:50:56,240
And we don't have a room to spare.

1292
01:50:57,110 --> 01:51:03,240
Why don't you let me worry about that, alright?
