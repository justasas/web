1
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:34,578
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

2
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:39,208
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot

3
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,162
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

4
00:00:43,257 --> 00:00:46,258
Yo ho, yo ho

5
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:49,298
A pirate's life for me

6
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:55,257
We extort, we pilfer
We filch, we sack...

7
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:59,014
Quiet, missy!
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

8
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:01,391
You don't want to bring
them down on us.

9
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:03,394
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

10
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,188
She was singing about pirates!

11
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:10,326
Bad luck to sing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog.

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,779
- Mark my words.
- Consider them marked.

13
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:17,037
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

14
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:22,084
Bad luck to have a woman on board,
too. Even a miniature one.

15
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:25,122
It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.

16
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:31,760
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile creatures, the lot of them.

17
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:36,227
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

18
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:38,305
gets what he deserves.

19
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,057
A short drop and a sudden stop.

20
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:47,438
I appreciate your fervor,

21
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:52,408
but I'm concerned about the effect this
subject will have upon my daughter.

22
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,239
My apologies, Governor Swann.

23
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:58,375
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- That's what concerns me.

24
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:29,189
There's a boy in the water!

25
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,488
Man overboard!

26
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:38,782
Man the ropes! Fetch a hook!
Haul him aboard!

27
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:49,253
He's still breathing.

28
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,588
Mary, Mother of God!

29
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,685
What happened here?

30
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:04,940
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

31
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:12,152
Lot of good it did them.
Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.

32
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:14,072
Pirates!

33
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:18,205
There's no proof of that!
It was probably an accident.

34
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:24,585
Rouse the captain. Heave to
and take in sail. Launch the boats.

35
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:29,419
Elizabeth, accompany the boy.

36
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:32,094
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

37
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:33,635
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

38
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:57,452
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.

39
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,244
Will Turner.

40
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,247
I'm watching over you, Will.

41
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,095
You're a pirate!

42
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:19,980
Has he said anything?

43
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:24,063
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

44
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:26,062
Take him below.

45
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,268
Elizabeth!

46
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:41,140
Are you all right?

47
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,435
Are you decent?

48
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:44,689
Yes.

49
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,688
Yes?

50
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,652
Still abed at this hour?

51
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:52,533
It's a beautiful day.

52
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,578
I have a gift for you.

53
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:02,118
- It's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

54
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,961
May I inquire as to the occasion?

55
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,882
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

56
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,381
Go on.

57
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:20,932
Actually... I had hoped you might
wear it for the ceremony today.

58
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,269
The ceremony?

59
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:25,028
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

60
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:26,309
I knew it!

61
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:29,358
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

62
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:33,661
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.

63
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:37,540
Elizabeth? How's it coming?

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,329
- It's difficult to say.
- It's the latest fashion in London.

65
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,164
Women in London
must've learned not to breathe!

66
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,337
My Lord, you have a visitor.

67
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:10,652
Mr. Turner! Good to see you again.

68
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:14,360
Good day, sir. I have your order.

69
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,248
The blade is folded steel. That's
gold filigree laid into the handle.

70
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,836
If I may?

71
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:32,700
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

72
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:34,972
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

73
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:40,053
Impressive. Very impressive.

74
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:45,191
Commodore Norrington's
going to be very pleased with this.

75
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:48,441
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

76
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,277
I shall.

77
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:56,903
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

78
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:01,367
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning!

79
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:05,378
Will! It's so good to see you!

80
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:09,628
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

81
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,670
- Elizabeth, is that proper?
- About the day we met. Remember?

82
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:15,842
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

83
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:19,268
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

84
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:22,605
At least once more, Miss Swann.
As always.

85
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:26,440
There. See? At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

86
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,735
We really must be going.

87
00:08:30,116 --> 00:08:32,322
Good day, Mr. Turner.

88
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:34,909
Come along!

89
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:38,998
Good day...

90
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,961
Elizabeth.

91
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:16,007
Hold up there, you!

92
00:10:17,102 --> 00:10:20,435
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

93
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:24,889
I need to know your name.

94
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,399
What do you say to three shillings
and we forget the name?

95
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:36,616
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

96
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,159
Two paces... march!

97
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,745
Right about... face!

98
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:24,003
Present... arms!

99
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,694
This dock is off limits to civilians.

100
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,069
This dock is off limits to civilians.

101
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,407
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

102
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:55,656
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

103
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,909
There's some high-toned
and fancy to-do at the fort.

104
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:08,080
How could it be that two upstanding
gentlemen did not merit an invitation?

105
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:12,091
We have to make sure this dock
stays off limits to civilians.

106
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:18,134
It's a fine goal, to be sure,
but it seems to me, a ship like that

107
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:20,801
makes this one here
a bit superfluous.

108
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:23,981
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters,

109
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,981
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

110
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:31,903
I've heard of one. It's supposed
to be fast, nigh uncatchable.

111
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:34,152
The Black Pearl.

112
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,036
There's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor.

113
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,207
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

114
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,296
- No, it's not.
- It is. I've seen it!

115
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:49,213
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

116
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,385
- You haven't seen it!
- Yes, I have!

117
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:57,678
You've seen a ship with black sails,
that's crewed by the damned

118
00:12:57,768 --> 00:13:02,976
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell itself spat him back out?

119
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,437
- No.
- No.

120
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:09,445
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

121
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,938
No ship not crewed by the damned

122
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:15,069
and captained by a man so evil,
Hell spat him back out,

123
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:19,539
could have black sails, so couldn't be
any other ship than The Black Pearl.

124
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:22,162
Is that what you're saying?

125
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,366
No.

126
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:28,040
Like I said, there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

127
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:38,600
You! Get away from there!
You don't have permission to be aboard!

128
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,473
I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty
boat. Ship!

129
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:46,063
- What's your name?
- Smith! Or Smithy, if you like.

130
00:13:46,152 --> 00:13:49,437
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
'Mr. Smith'?

131
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,113
- And no lies!
- All right. I confess.

132
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:55,660
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

133
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:57,328
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

134
00:13:57,413 --> 00:14:00,284
rape, pillage and otherwise
pilfer my black guts out.

135
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,325
- I said no lies!
- I think he's telling the truth.

136
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,706
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

137
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:11,798
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

138
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:23,891
May I have a moment?

139
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:35,109
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

140
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,408
I apologize if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

141
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:51,299
This promotion throws into sharp relief
that which I have not yet achieved.

142
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:56,052
A marriage to a fine woman.

143
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:59,728
You have become a fine woman.

144
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:02,353
I can't breathe!

145
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,226
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

146
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:10,318
Then they made me their chief.

147
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,401
Elizabeth?

148
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:18,370
Elizabeth!

149
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,875
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

150
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:27,839
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim!

151
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:33,553
Pride of the King's Navy, you are!
Do not lose these.

152
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:49,604
What was that?

153
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,109
I got her!

154
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,071
- She's not breathing!
- Move!

155
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,706
- I never would've thought of that.
- You've never been to Singapore.

156
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,511
Where did you get that?

157
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,135
On your feet.

158
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,767
Elizabeth!

159
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,973
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

160
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,862
- Shoot him!
- Father!

161
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,863
Commodore, do you intend
to kill my rescuer?

162
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,833
I believe thanks are in order.

163
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:32,546
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, pirate?

164
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,215
Hang him!

165
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:39,173
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

166
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,471
Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

167
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,846
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

168
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:48,943
I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.

169
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,442
I'm in the market, as it were.

170
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:53,820
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

171
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:57,028
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his.

172
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:03,034
No additional shot nor powder.

173
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,751
A compass that doesn't point north.

174
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:15,052
I half expected it to be made from wood.

175
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:20,556
You are without doubt
the worst pirate I've ever heard of!

176
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:22,886
But you have heard of me.

177
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,058
Commodore, I must protest!

178
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:29,234
Carefully, Lieutenant.

179
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,526
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

180
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:35,528
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man for his wickedness!

181
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:38,370
- It seems enough to condemn him.
- Indeed.

182
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:41,326
Finally.

183
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,871
- Don't shoot!
- I knew you'd warm up to me.

184
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:50,090
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please. And my hat.

185
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,087
Commodore.

186
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:58,014
- Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?
- It's Miss Swann.

187
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,343
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

188
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:06,766
If you'll be very kind.

189
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:25,498
Easy on the goods, darling.

190
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:29,420
- You're despicable.
- Sticks and stones, love.

191
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:32,260
I saved your life, you saved mine.
We're square.

192
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:36,008
Gentlemen, my lady,

193
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:39,431
you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

194
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:41,973
Captain Jack Sparrow!

195
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:03,785
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

196
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:13,126
On his heels!

197
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:30,525
Take cover, man!

198
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:35,358
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has
a dawn appointment with the gallows.

199
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:37,657
I would hate for him to miss it.

200
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,324
Search up the stairs!

201
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,077
Look lively, men!

202
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:20,432
Right where I left you.

203
00:22:27,442 --> 00:22:30,063
Not where I left you.

204
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:41,619
You're the one they're hunting.

205
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:44,040
The pirate!

206
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:47,246
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

207
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:50,125
I avoid familiarity with pirates.

208
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,713
It would be a shame to put a black
mark on your record. Excuse me.

209
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:04,138
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?

210
00:23:05,273 --> 00:23:07,728
You threatened Miss Swann.

211
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:11,693
Only a little.

212
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:30,547
You know what you're doing.
Excellent form. How's your footwork?

213
00:23:30,632 --> 00:23:32,755
If I step here...

214
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:35,463
Good.

215
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:37,630
And now I step again.

216
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:44,478
Ta.

217
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,825
That is a wonderful trick.

218
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:10,163
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

219
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:13,293
And now...
you have no weapon.

220
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:37,282
Who makes all these?

221
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:40,067
I do.

222
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:44,037
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

223
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,036
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

224
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:59,631
Or, the reason you practice three hours
a day is that you already found one

225
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:03,343
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

226
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:05,928
You're not a eunuch, are you?

227
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:10,400
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!

228
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:29,938
- You cheated!
- Pirate.

229
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,523
- Move away!
- No.

230
00:26:35,616 --> 00:26:36,991
Please?

231
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:40,859
No! I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

232
00:26:43,457 --> 00:26:45,450
This shot is not meant for you.

233
00:26:55,803 --> 00:26:57,796
There he is! Over here!

234
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:05,727
Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've
assisted in the capture of a fugitive.

235
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:08,102
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

236
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:15,153
I trust you will remember this as the
day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

237
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,782
Take him away.

238
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,333
- Come here, boy. Come here.
- Who wants a juicy bone?

239
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,712
Come here, boy!

240
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:34,717
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

241
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:38,930
Excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

242
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:50,025
There you go, miss. It was
a difficult day for you, I'm sure.

243
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:55,270
I suspected Commodore Norrington would
propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.

244
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:59,529
I meant you being threatened
by that pirate! Sounds terrifying!

245
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,906
Yes, it was terrifying.

246
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:06,201
But... the Commodore proposed!
Fancy that.

247
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:10,077
That's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

248
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:11,583
It is a smart match.

249
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:14,508
He's a fine man.

250
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:19,259
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

251
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:23,725
That Will Turner...
he's a fine man, too.

252
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:25,602
That is too bold.

253
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:29,472
Beggin' your pardon.
It was not my place.

254
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:21,327
Has my daughter
given you an answer yet?

255
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:23,037
No, she hasn't.

256
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:25,448
She has had a trying day.

257
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:31,255
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Really bleak.

258
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,709
What's that?

259
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:37,009
Cannon fire!

260
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:40,262
Return fire!

261
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:42,681
I know those guns.

262
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:50,397
It's the Pearl.

263
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:52,477
The Black Pearl?

264
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,238
I've heard stories.

265
00:29:56,323 --> 00:30:00,321
She's been preying on ships
and settlements for ten years.

266
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:03,495
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

267
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:07,368
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

268
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,568
Mama!

269
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:41,920
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes!

270
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:46,394
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.

271
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,602
Governor. Barricade yourself
in my office.

272
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,066
That's an order.

273
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,173
Don't!

274
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:15,630
Hello, chum.

275
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:20,548
Up there!

276
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:33,028
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you.

277
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:35,732
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

278
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,731
In here!

279
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:42,822
They haven't seen you.
First chance you get, run to the fort.

280
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,463
Gotcha!

281
00:32:59,472 --> 00:33:01,963
No! It's hot. I'm burning!

282
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:03,137
Come on!

283
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:09,770
Come on, me men.

284
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,221
We know you're here, poppet.

285
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:53,984
- Poppet!
- Come out.

286
00:33:54,195 --> 00:33:56,651
We promise we won't hurt you.

287
00:33:58,825 --> 00:34:01,398
We will find you, poppet.

288
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:06,200
You've got something of ours
and it calls to us.

289
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:14,377
The gold calls to us.

290
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,839
The gold.

291
00:34:22,766 --> 00:34:24,842
Hello, poppet.

292
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:27,600
Parley.

293
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:31,057
- What?
- I invoke the right of parley.

294
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:36,524
The Code of the Brethren states
you have to take me to your captain.

295
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:38,274
I know the Code.

296
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:42,233
You can do me no harm
until the parley is complete.

297
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:46,955
- To blazes with the Code.
- She wants to be taken to the Captain.

298
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,706
And she'll go, without a fuss.

299
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:53,832
We must honor the Code.

300
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,469
Say goodbye!

301
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,810
Goodbye.

302
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:18,563
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

303
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,373
Out of my way, scum!

304
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,390
My sympathies. You've no manner
of luck at all.

305
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:10,083
Come on, doggy! It's just
you and me now.

306
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:16,539
It's you and old Jack. Come on.
That's a boy! Get your bone!

307
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:20,217
That's a good boy.
A bit closer!

308
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:22,631
That's it, doggy!

309
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:26,058
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy character!

310
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:30,767
No! I didn't mean it!

311
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,862
This ain't the armory!

312
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:47,197
Well, well, well. Look what we have
here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow!

313
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,534
Last time I saw you,

314
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:57,247
you were all alone on a godforsaken
island, shrinking into the distance.

315
00:36:57,552 --> 00:37:00,090
His fortunes aren't improved much.

316
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:03,595
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

317
00:37:03,683 --> 00:37:08,345
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers.

318
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:14,642
So there is a curse.

319
00:37:16,154 --> 00:37:20,022
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of Hell.

320
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,243
That's very interesting.

321
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:07,993
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

322
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:11,369
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

323
00:38:11,462 --> 00:38:15,080
- I am here to...
- You will speak when spoken to.

324
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:21,133
And ye will not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley.

325
00:38:21,222 --> 00:38:23,131
Aye, sir.

326
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:28,060
My apologies, miss.

327
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:33,935
Captain Barbossa... I am here to
negotiate the cessation of hostilities.

328
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:39,398
There are a lot of long words there.
We're naught but humble pirates.

329
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:44,322
- What is it you want?
- Leave and never come back.

330
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,489
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

331
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:53,083
Means "no."

332
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,753
Very well.

333
00:38:58,177 --> 00:39:00,169
I'll drop it.

334
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:08,892
Me holds are burstin' with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?

335
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,021
Why?

336
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:15,021
It's what you've been searching for.
I recognize the ship.

337
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:18,028
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

338
00:39:18,114 --> 00:39:20,190
Did you now?

339
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:27,991
Fine. I suppose if it is worthless
there's no point in me keeping it.

340
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,791
No!

341
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:42,129
You have a name, missy?

342
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:48,935
Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid
in the Governor's household.

343
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:54,225
Miss Turner!

344
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:57,571
- Turner!
- Bootstrap!

345
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:06,825
How does a maid come to own
that trinket? Family heirloom?

346
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,791
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

347
00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:15,291
You hand it over
and we'll leave and never return.

348
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:31,264
Our bargain?

349
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:38,270
Still the guns and stow them. Signal
the men and make good to clear port.

350
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:41,199
You have to take me to shore.
According to the Code...

351
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:42,943
First...

352
00:40:43,035 --> 00:40:47,199
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiations so I must do nothing.

353
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,453
Secondly, you must be a pirate for the
Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.

354
00:40:51,544 --> 00:40:56,883
Thirdly, the code is more what
you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

355
00:40:56,966 --> 00:41:00,501
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

356
00:41:21,283 --> 00:41:23,691
They've taken Elizabeth!

357
00:41:23,786 --> 00:41:26,621
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

358
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:29,702
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

359
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:32,330
Where do you propose we start?

360
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,963
If you have any information
concerning my daughter, share it.

361
00:41:38,384 --> 00:41:42,299
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

362
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:45,390
Mentioned it is more what he did.

363
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:48,930
Ask him where it is!
He could lead us to it.

364
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:50,723
No.

365
00:41:50,814 --> 00:41:56,733
The pirates left Sparrow in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

366
00:41:57,237 --> 00:42:00,191
We will establish their
most likely course...

367
00:42:00,282 --> 00:42:02,654
That's not good enough!

368
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:09,956
Mr. Turner, you are not a military man
or a sailor. You are a blacksmith.

369
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:13,999
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

370
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:21,006
Do not think you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

371
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:27,261
Please.

372
00:42:31,898 --> 00:42:34,187
- You! Sparrow!
- Aye?

373
00:42:34,526 --> 00:42:37,195
You are familiar with
the Black Pearl?

374
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,734
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

375
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:43,987
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

376
00:42:45,746 --> 00:42:52,116
Captain Barbossa and his crew of
miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.

377
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:58,214
It's an island that cannot be found,
except by those who know where it is.

378
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,508
The ship's real, therefore its anchorage
must be a real place. Where?

379
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,801
- Why ask me?
- Because you're a pirate.

380
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:11,554
You want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

381
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,016
Never!

382
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,146
- They took Miss Swann.
- So it is that you found a girl!

383
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:22,108
I see!

384
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,320
If you intend to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

385
00:43:25,412 --> 00:43:29,741
and so, win fair lady's heart,
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

386
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:32,834
I see no profit in it for me.

387
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:35,749
- I can get you out of here.
- The key's run off.

388
00:43:36,006 --> 00:43:40,419
I helped build these cells.
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

389
00:43:41,762 --> 00:43:47,386
With leverage and the proper application
of strength, the door will lift free.

390
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:53,187
- What's your name?
- Will Turner.

391
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:58,060
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good, strong name.

392
00:43:59,072 --> 00:44:02,073
No doubt named for your father.

393
00:44:02,867 --> 00:44:04,825
Yes.

394
00:44:06,705 --> 00:44:09,871
Mr. Turner, I've changed me mind.

395
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:12,959
If you spring me from here,
I swear, on pain of death,

396
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:16,959
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,
and your bonny lass.

397
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:19,622
Do we have an accord?

398
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:25,591
- Agreed.
- Agreed! Get me out!

399
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:32,638
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

400
00:44:39,197 --> 00:44:41,355
We're going to steal a ship?

401
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:45,363
- That ship?
- Commandeer.

402
00:44:45,453 --> 00:44:48,905
We're going to "commandeer" that ship.
Nautical term.

403
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:53,499
One question about your business,
or there's no use going.

404
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:57,454
This girl, how far are you willing to go
to save her?

405
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:02,294
- I'd die for her.
- Good. No worries then.

406
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:23,815
This is either madness or brilliance.

407
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,279
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

408
00:45:57,987 --> 00:46:01,819
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

409
00:46:01,907 --> 00:46:03,947
Aye! Avast!

410
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:11,829
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You'll never make it out of the bay.

411
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:16,957
Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

412
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:19,049
Savvy?

413
00:46:22,554 --> 00:46:25,839
- Commodore!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

414
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:31,392
Commodore! They've taken the ship!

415
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,765
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

416
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,895
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

417
00:46:39,488 --> 00:46:43,700
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.

418
00:46:46,996 --> 00:46:49,202
Here they come.

419
00:46:53,085 --> 00:46:55,374
Bring her around!

420
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,924
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

421
00:47:21,198 --> 00:47:23,819
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!

422
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:33,783
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

423
00:47:33,878 --> 00:47:36,499
We'd have had
a hard time by ourselves.

424
00:47:39,717 --> 00:47:42,042
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

425
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:44,508
With this wind we won't catch them.

426
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:47,764
I don't need to. Get them in range
of the long nines.

427
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,970
Run out the guns!

428
00:47:51,062 --> 00:47:53,636
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

429
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:58,726
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

430
00:47:58,904 --> 00:48:02,320
Commodore!
He's disabled the rudder chain.

431
00:48:05,994 --> 00:48:08,034
Abandon ship!

432
00:48:14,378 --> 00:48:17,712
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

433
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:20,504
So it would seem.

434
00:48:29,227 --> 00:48:33,059
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

435
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:37,062
After she died, I came here,
looking for my father.

436
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:40,568
Is that so?

437
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:44,449
My father, Bill Turner?

438
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:47,535
It was only after you learned my name
you agreed to help.

439
00:48:47,621 --> 00:48:50,408
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

440
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:53,998
I'm not a simpleton.
You knew my father.

441
00:49:00,175 --> 00:49:04,588
I knew him. Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

442
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,800
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap".

443
00:49:07,892 --> 00:49:09,801
Bootstrap?

444
00:49:09,894 --> 00:49:14,355
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.

445
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:19,642
It's not true. He was a merchant sailor.
A respectable man who obeyed the law.

446
00:49:19,862 --> 00:49:22,947
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

447
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:26,160
My father was not a pirate!

448
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:31,161
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.

449
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:35,746
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

450
00:49:35,837 --> 00:49:38,838
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

451
00:49:46,098 --> 00:49:49,384
As long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

452
00:49:49,476 --> 00:49:52,264
The only rules that matter are these:

453
00:49:52,354 --> 00:49:55,806
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

454
00:49:56,525 --> 00:50:02,030
You can accept your father was a
pirate and a good man, or you can't.

455
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:06,444
Pirate is in your blood, so you'll
have to square with that someday.

456
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,074
Me, for example,
I can let you drown,

457
00:50:09,164 --> 00:50:13,660
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies, savvy?

458
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,537
So.

459
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:22,925
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

460
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,213
Or can you not?

461
00:50:28,267 --> 00:50:29,975
Tortuga?

462
00:50:30,102 --> 00:50:31,513
Tortuga.

463
00:50:54,711 --> 00:50:57,380
It is a sad life
that has never breathed deep

464
00:50:57,464 --> 00:51:00,915
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

465
00:51:02,636 --> 00:51:04,509
What do you think?

466
00:51:08,058 --> 00:51:10,763
- It'll linger.
- I'll tell you, mate,

467
00:51:10,978 --> 00:51:16,731
if every town were like this one,
no man would ever feel unwanted.

468
00:51:17,484 --> 00:51:19,691
Scarlett!

469
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:21,861
Not sure I deserved that.

470
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:22,943
Not sure I deserved that.

471
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:24,507
Giselle.

472
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:25,148
Giselle.

473
00:51:25,242 --> 00:51:26,950
- Who was she?
- What?

474
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:30,615
I may have deserved that.

475
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:36,043
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

476
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:40,624
Mother's love!

477
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:42,425
Jack!

478
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,839
You should know not to wake a man
when he's sleepin'.

479
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,798
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

480
00:51:49,893 --> 00:51:53,060
The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink.

481
00:51:53,397 --> 00:51:58,272
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to his proposition.

482
00:52:00,571 --> 00:52:03,406
Aye, that'll about do it.

483
00:52:07,453 --> 00:52:09,410
Blast! I'm already awake!

484
00:52:09,747 --> 00:52:11,905
That was for the smell.

485
00:52:21,634 --> 00:52:23,627
Keep a sharp eye.

486
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,412
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

487
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:34,097
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

488
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:37,515
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

489
00:52:41,279 --> 00:52:44,613
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

490
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:49,035
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

491
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:52,407
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

492
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:55,536
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

493
00:52:55,628 --> 00:52:57,870
All I need is a crew.

494
00:52:57,963 --> 00:53:02,839
Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer
fools nor strike a bargain with one.

495
00:53:02,927 --> 00:53:05,169
It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.

496
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:10,304
Prove me wrong. What makes you think
Barbossa will give up his ship to you?

497
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:13,727
Let's just say it's a matter
of leverage.

498
00:53:29,997 --> 00:53:31,989
The kid?

499
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:35,584
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

500
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,126
His only child. Savvy?

501
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:41,789
Is he now?

502
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,467
Leverage, says you.

503
00:53:46,555 --> 00:53:49,592
I feel a change in the wind, says I.

504
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:53,895
I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be
some sailors on this rock crazy as you.

505
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:56,352
One can only hope.

506
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,837
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

507
00:53:57,873 --> 00:53:59,233
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

508
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:28,216
You'll be dining with the captain,
and he requests you wear this.

509
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,760
Tell him that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

510
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,138
He said you'd say that.

511
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:40,693
He also said if that be the case,
you'll be dining with the crew.

512
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,779
And you'll be naked.

513
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:49,901
Fine.

514
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:10,221
There's no need to stand on ceremony,
no call to impress anyone.

515
00:55:11,268 --> 00:55:13,759
You must be hungry.

516
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,072
Try the wine.

517
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:39,170
And the apples. One of those next.

518
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:49,969
It's poisoned.

519
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:52,849
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

520
00:55:53,062 --> 00:55:57,059
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

521
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:04,110
You don't know what this is, do you?

522
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:06,191
It's a pirate medallion.

523
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,368
This is Aztec gold.

524
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:15,457
One of 882 identical pieces they
delivered in a stone chest to Cortés.

525
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:19,353
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

526
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,746
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

527
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:24,878
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

528
00:56:25,178 --> 00:56:28,630
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

529
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:33,055
a terrible curse.

530
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:38,978
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

531
00:56:39,068 --> 00:56:40,753
shall be punished for eternity.

532
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:42,438
Shall be punished for eternity.

533
00:56:43,822 --> 00:56:47,274
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

534
00:56:47,368 --> 00:56:48,482
Aye.

535
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:52,821
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

536
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:55,916
Buried on an island of the dead
what cannot be found,

537
00:56:56,002 --> 00:56:58,623
except for those who know where it is.

538
00:56:59,422 --> 00:57:01,462
Find it, we did.

539
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:06,589
There be the chest.
Inside be the gold.

540
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:08,802
And we took 'em all!

541
00:57:09,182 --> 00:57:11,175
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

542
00:57:11,268 --> 00:57:15,396
and frittered 'em away on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

543
00:57:15,772 --> 00:57:20,980
The more we gave 'em away,
the more we came to realize...

544
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,154
the drink would not satisfy.

545
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,072
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

546
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:28,906
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

547
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:33,656
and all the pleasurable company
in the world could not slake our lust.

548
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:38,584
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

549
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:42,959
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

550
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,506
we are consumed by it.

551
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,984
There is one way we can end our curse.

552
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:08,407
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold must be restored,

553
00:58:08,493 --> 00:58:10,486
and the blood repaid.

554
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:17,075
Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.

555
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:21,294
And the blood to be repaid?

556
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:24,965
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you.

557
00:58:25,052 --> 00:58:27,010
Yet.

558
00:58:27,847 --> 00:58:30,338
Apple?

559
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:50,197
I'm curious. After killing me,
what are you planning on doing next?

560
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:55,890
Look!

561
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,147
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

562
00:59:59,942 --> 01:00:01,547
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

563
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:03,152
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

564
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,064
But neither are we dead.

565
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:09,983
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

566
01:00:10,078 --> 01:00:12,577
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

567
01:00:12,614 --> 01:00:15,078
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

568
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,289
I feel nothing.

569
01:00:17,377 --> 01:00:20,295
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

570
01:00:21,715 --> 01:00:24,206
nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

571
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:29,387
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

572
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:31,382
You're in one!

573
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:51,657
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

574
01:00:51,746 --> 01:00:54,782
You heard the captain.
Back to work.

575
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:05,214
Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

576
01:01:05,302 --> 01:01:08,386
Every man worth his salt,

577
01:01:08,597 --> 01:01:10,471
and crazy to boot.

578
01:01:10,682 --> 01:01:13,553
So this is your able-bodied crew?

579
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:21,816
- You, sailor!
- Cotton, sir.

580
01:01:21,902 --> 01:01:25,402
Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders

581
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:28,526
and stay true in the face of danger
and almost certain death?

582
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:33,115
- Mr. Cotton. Answer, man!
- He's a mute, sir.

583
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:37,453
Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so
he trained the parrot to talk for him.

584
01:01:37,543 --> 01:01:39,583
No one's yet figured how.

585
01:01:42,257 --> 01:01:46,207
Mr. Cotton's parrot,
same question.

586
01:01:46,428 --> 01:01:49,797
Wind in your sails!
Wind in your sails!

587
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,714
Mostly, we figure that means "yes".

588
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,051
Of course it does. Satisfied?

589
01:01:56,021 --> 01:01:58,014
Well, you've proved they're mad.

590
01:01:58,106 --> 01:02:00,479
What's the benefit for us?

591
01:02:10,536 --> 01:02:11,615
Anamaria!

592
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:17,949
- I suppose you didn't deserve that.
- No, that one I deserved.

593
01:02:18,044 --> 01:02:20,914
- You stole my boat!
- Actually...

594
01:02:23,007 --> 01:02:28,084
Borrowed without permission, but with
every intention of bringing it back.

595
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:30,967
- But you didn't!
- You'll get another one.

596
01:02:32,726 --> 01:02:34,718
- I will.
- A better one.

597
01:02:34,811 --> 01:02:36,638
A better one!

598
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:39,019
- That one.
- What one?

599
01:02:40,859 --> 01:02:42,519
That one?

600
01:02:45,572 --> 01:02:47,280
Aye. That one.

601
01:02:47,366 --> 01:02:48,908
- What say you?
- Aye!

602
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:50,368
Aye!

603
01:02:50,452 --> 01:02:52,445
Anchor's aweigh!

604
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:56,666
No, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

605
01:02:56,751 --> 01:02:59,039
It'll be far worse not to have her.

606
01:03:32,871 --> 01:03:36,240
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

607
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:38,540
with a compass that doesn't work?

608
01:03:38,627 --> 01:03:43,373
The compass doesn't point north, but
we're not trying to find north, are we?

609
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,468
We should drop canvas, sir.

610
01:03:56,562 --> 01:03:58,602
She can hold a bit longer.

611
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:04,441
What's in your head as puts you
in such a fine mood, Cap'n?

612
01:04:04,529 --> 01:04:06,189
We're catching up.

613
01:04:21,255 --> 01:04:23,294
Time to go, poppet.

614
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:23,352
Dead men tell no tales.

615
01:05:25,905 --> 01:05:30,484
Chills the bones, how many honest
sailors been claimed by this passage.

616
01:05:45,926 --> 01:05:48,298
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

617
01:05:48,387 --> 01:05:51,471
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
before he came to Tortuga

618
01:05:51,557 --> 01:05:54,226
with a mind to find the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

619
01:05:54,435 --> 01:05:57,768
That was before I'd met him, when he
was captain of the Black Pearl.

620
01:05:58,647 --> 01:05:59,679
What?

621
01:06:03,569 --> 01:06:07,353
- He failed to mention that.
- He plays things close to the vest now.

622
01:06:07,448 --> 01:06:09,655
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

623
01:06:09,742 --> 01:06:14,238
Three days into the trip, the first mate
says, "Everything's an equal share."

624
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:19,076
"The location of the treasure, too."
So Jack gives up the bearings.

625
01:06:19,169 --> 01:06:22,454
That night, there was a mutiny.

626
01:06:22,547 --> 01:06:25,632
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

627
01:06:25,717 --> 01:06:29,051
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

628
01:06:32,057 --> 01:06:34,215
So that's the reason for all the...

629
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,058
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

630
01:06:39,148 --> 01:06:44,604
When a pirate's marooned, he's given
a pistol with a single shot. One shot.

631
01:06:44,695 --> 01:06:47,566
That won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

632
01:06:47,656 --> 01:06:51,322
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

633
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:54,411
that pistol looks real friendly.

634
01:06:54,497 --> 01:06:57,783
But Jack escaped the island,
and still has that single shot.

635
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:01,410
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

636
01:07:01,504 --> 01:07:03,544
His mutinous first mate.

637
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:05,624
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

638
01:07:06,885 --> 01:07:10,218
- How did Jack get off the island?
- I'll tell ye.

639
01:07:10,305 --> 01:07:14,634
He waded out into the shallows,
and waited three days and three nights,

640
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:19,472
till all manner of sea creatures
became acclimated to his presence.

641
01:07:19,564 --> 01:07:23,397
On the fourth morning,
he roped a couple of sea turtles,

642
01:07:23,485 --> 01:07:25,857
lashed them together
and made a raft.

643
01:07:27,573 --> 01:07:31,357
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

644
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:35,946
What did he use for rope?

645
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:43,454
Human hair.

646
01:07:43,548 --> 01:07:46,039
From my back.

647
01:07:46,134 --> 01:07:49,585
- Let go the anchor!
- Lower the anchor line!

648
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:50,908
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

649
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:52,139
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.

650
01:07:52,724 --> 01:07:53,839
Captain.

651
01:07:53,933 --> 01:07:56,471
What if the worst should happen?

652
01:07:56,561 --> 01:07:59,847
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye. The Code.

653
01:08:26,217 --> 01:08:30,760
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- Now we finally get to spend it.

654
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:40,683
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

655
01:08:41,441 --> 01:08:45,106
and you can buy an eye
that fits and is made of glass.

656
01:08:45,195 --> 01:08:48,149
This one does splinter
something terrible.

657
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,192
Stop rubbing it.

658
01:09:10,137 --> 01:09:13,138
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

659
01:09:13,224 --> 01:09:15,513
Pirates' Code.

660
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:19,433
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

661
01:09:20,732 --> 01:09:23,057
No heroes amongst thieves.

662
01:09:24,444 --> 01:09:26,686
For having such a bleak outlook
on pirates

663
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:29,235
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

664
01:09:30,283 --> 01:09:33,154
Sprung a man from jail,

665
01:09:33,245 --> 01:09:35,652
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

666
01:09:35,747 --> 01:09:38,452
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

667
01:09:40,502 --> 01:09:43,539
and you're completely obsessed
with treasure.

668
01:09:46,508 --> 01:09:50,091
That's not true. I am not obsessed
with treasure.

669
01:09:57,311 --> 01:10:00,016
Not all treasure is silver
and gold, mate.

670
01:10:00,106 --> 01:10:03,190
Gentlemen, the time has come!

671
01:10:03,276 --> 01:10:05,849
Salvation is nigh!

672
01:10:06,988 --> 01:10:10,439
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

673
01:10:10,909 --> 01:10:13,067
For ten years
we've been tested and tried

674
01:10:13,161 --> 01:10:18,404
and each man here has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

675
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,825
and a hundred times again!

676
01:10:22,587 --> 01:10:25,126
Suffered, I have!

677
01:10:25,215 --> 01:10:31,752
Punished we were, the lot of us,
disproportionate to our crime!

678
01:10:33,682 --> 01:10:35,390
Here it is!

679
01:10:38,813 --> 01:10:42,229
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

680
01:10:44,235 --> 01:10:48,564
Every last piece that went astray,
we have returned.

681
01:10:49,407 --> 01:10:50,949
Save for this!

682
01:10:51,034 --> 01:10:53,904
- Jack!
- Not yet.

683
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:56,863
We wait for the opportune moment.

684
01:11:00,043 --> 01:11:04,670
When's that? When it's of greatest
profit to you?

685
01:11:04,756 --> 01:11:07,378
May I ask you something?

686
01:11:07,467 --> 01:11:09,958
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

687
01:11:11,179 --> 01:11:16,422
Do us a favor. I know it's difficult
for you, but please stay here.

688
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:18,844
And try not to do anything stupid.

689
01:11:22,066 --> 01:11:26,016
Who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

690
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:29,812
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet be paid?

691
01:11:29,907 --> 01:11:31,567
Hers!

692
01:11:33,786 --> 01:11:38,365
You know the first thing I'm going to do
after the curse is lifted?

693
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:44,044
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

694
01:11:51,888 --> 01:11:53,881
Begun by blood.

695
01:11:53,974 --> 01:11:55,967
By blood undone.

696
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:03,979
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not going to be your leverage.

697
01:12:13,202 --> 01:12:15,610
That's it?

698
01:12:15,705 --> 01:12:17,199
Waste not.

699
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:56,407
Did it work?

700
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,415
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

701
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,040
You're not dead!

702
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,677
No.

703
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,589
- He shot me.
- It didn't work.

704
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,220
The curse is still upon us!

705
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,187
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

706
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:26,518
Was your father William Turner?

707
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:28,316
No.

708
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:31,739
Where's his child who sailed
from England eight years ago?

709
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:35,444
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner? Where?

710
01:13:42,503 --> 01:13:46,880
You two!
You brought us the wrong person!

711
01:13:48,134 --> 01:13:49,509
No!

712
01:13:49,594 --> 01:13:52,429
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

713
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:55,633
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.

714
01:13:56,893 --> 01:13:59,265
I think she lied to us.

715
01:14:00,688 --> 01:14:03,014
You brought us here for nothing.

716
01:14:03,108 --> 01:14:07,188
I won't take questioning,
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

717
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:11,526
Who's to blame him? Your decisions
have led us from bad to worse!

718
01:14:13,785 --> 01:14:16,323
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

719
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:22,830
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place!

720
01:14:24,713 --> 01:14:28,758
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

721
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:34,219
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood. Just in case.

722
01:14:34,307 --> 01:14:35,765
Yeah!

723
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,355
The medallion! She's taken it!

724
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:51,229
Get after her, you feckless pack
of ingrates!

725
01:14:57,205 --> 01:14:59,910
- Where are the oars?
- There's no oars!

726
01:14:60,000 --> 01:15:02,918
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

727
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:13,507
You!

728
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:18,058
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Am I not?

729
01:15:28,321 --> 01:15:30,314
Pearlie...

730
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:33,232
Palu-li-la-la-lulu...

731
01:15:35,954 --> 01:15:37,781
Parlili...

732
01:15:37,872 --> 01:15:40,411
Parsnip... Parsley...

733
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,742
Partner...

734
01:15:42,836 --> 01:15:45,374
- Parley?
- That's the one! Parley!

735
01:15:45,964 --> 01:15:47,079
Parley!

736
01:15:47,174 --> 01:15:49,083
Parley?

737
01:15:49,718 --> 01:15:53,550
Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead
thought of parley!

738
01:15:54,932 --> 01:15:56,925
That would be the French.

739
01:16:09,322 --> 01:16:12,239
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

740
01:16:13,618 --> 01:16:14,697
Mr. Gibbs?

741
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:17,825
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

742
01:16:17,914 --> 01:16:20,405
Jack Sparrow?

743
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,203
He fell behind.

744
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:33,466
Keep to the Code.

745
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:36,342
Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails!

746
01:16:36,433 --> 01:16:38,426
Split-quick, you dibbies!

747
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:47,229
How the blazes did you get
off that island?

748
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:52,195
When you marooned me
on that godforsaken spit of land,

749
01:16:52,283 --> 01:16:54,655
you forgot one very important thing.

750
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:58,572
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

751
01:16:59,165 --> 01:17:03,459
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

752
01:17:04,462 --> 01:17:07,962
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

753
01:17:08,049 --> 01:17:09,709
Aye.

754
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:11,877
Kill him.

755
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:15,424
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

756
01:17:17,267 --> 01:17:19,307
Hold your fire!

757
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:27,640
You know whose blood we need.

758
01:17:29,363 --> 01:17:32,032
I know whose blood you need.

759
01:17:38,372 --> 01:17:40,946
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

760
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:43,034
A pirate.

761
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:46,581
Here. Let me.

762
01:17:46,673 --> 01:17:48,665
Thank you.

763
01:17:49,509 --> 01:17:53,008
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

764
01:17:54,264 --> 01:17:56,256
Why?

765
01:17:58,351 --> 01:18:00,344
I don't know.

766
01:18:00,812 --> 01:18:03,849
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

767
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:08,484
- They're rough.
- No. I mean, yes, they are, but...

768
01:18:11,824 --> 01:18:13,900
Don't stop.

769
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:22,703
Elizabeth.

770
01:18:38,643 --> 01:18:40,636
It's yours.

771
01:18:44,357 --> 01:18:47,773
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

772
01:18:47,861 --> 01:18:51,312
It was a gift from my father.
He sent it to me.

773
01:18:57,579 --> 01:18:59,619
Why did you take it?

774
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:03,406
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

775
01:19:05,212 --> 01:19:07,205
That would've been awful.

776
01:19:10,468 --> 01:19:13,671
It wasn't your blood they needed.

777
01:19:16,099 --> 01:19:18,091
It was my father's blood.

778
01:19:19,811 --> 01:19:22,136
My blood.

779
01:19:27,068 --> 01:19:30,651
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

780
01:19:44,003 --> 01:19:46,161
So you expect to leave me on some beach

781
01:19:46,255 --> 01:19:49,256
with nothing but a name
and your word it's the one I need,

782
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:53,042
and watch you
sail away in my ship.

783
01:19:53,137 --> 01:19:54,300
No.

784
01:19:54,388 --> 01:19:58,517
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

785
01:19:58,601 --> 01:20:03,643
watching me sail away on my ship, and
then I'll shout the name back to you.

786
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:04,976
Savvy?

787
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,818
But that still leaves me
standing on some beach,

788
01:20:07,902 --> 01:20:12,031
with naught but a name and
your word it's the one I need.

789
01:20:13,116 --> 01:20:18,323
Of the two of us, I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

790
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:22,363
Therefore, my word
is the one we'll be trusting.

791
01:20:22,459 --> 01:20:27,002
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

792
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:30,209
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

793
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:35,010
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

794
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:37,422
Funny old world, isn't it?

795
01:20:40,019 --> 01:20:42,557
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

796
01:20:55,744 --> 01:20:57,736
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

797
01:20:58,413 --> 01:21:02,114
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

798
01:21:02,209 --> 01:21:05,494
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

799
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:10,165
Now that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

800
01:21:10,259 --> 01:21:13,010
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

801
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:16,214
Lock him in the brig.

802
01:21:28,361 --> 01:21:30,234
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

803
01:21:30,321 --> 01:21:33,655
With this wind,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

804
01:21:33,741 --> 01:21:37,490
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl is gaining on us!

805
01:21:41,624 --> 01:21:44,376
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

806
01:21:44,461 --> 01:21:46,786
Tell them that after they've caught us.

807
01:21:47,464 --> 01:21:49,919
- We're shallower on the draft, right?
- Aye.

808
01:21:50,008 --> 01:21:52,215
Then can't we lose them
on those shoals?

809
01:21:53,845 --> 01:21:56,763
We don't have to outrun 'em long.
Just long enough.

810
01:21:56,848 --> 01:21:59,174
Lighten the ship!
Stem to stern!

811
01:21:59,268 --> 01:22:02,434
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

812
01:22:11,822 --> 01:22:13,815
Apparently, there's a leak.

813
01:22:28,548 --> 01:22:31,668
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

814
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:34,503
And run out the sweeps.

815
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:04,534
We're gonna need that.

816
01:23:12,677 --> 01:23:15,464
It was a good plan, up till now.

817
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:16,966
Gibbs!

818
01:23:17,057 --> 01:23:20,639
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!

819
01:23:20,852 --> 01:23:22,975
- Load the guns!
- With what?

820
01:23:23,063 --> 01:23:26,646
Anything! Everything!
Anything we have left.

821
01:23:28,652 --> 01:23:30,609
Load the guns!

822
01:23:30,696 --> 01:23:34,065
Case shot and langrage!
Nails and crushed glass!

823
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:38,611
With a will!

824
01:23:59,142 --> 01:24:02,178
The Pearl will luff up
on our port quarter.

825
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,808
She'll rake us
without presenting a target.

826
01:24:04,898 --> 01:24:07,436
Lower the anchor on the right side.

827
01:24:07,526 --> 01:24:09,814
On the starboard side!

828
01:24:09,903 --> 01:24:13,817
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady. You both are.

829
01:24:14,116 --> 01:24:16,155
Daft like Jack.

830
01:24:16,243 --> 01:24:18,117
Lower the starboard anchor!

831
01:24:18,412 --> 01:24:21,911
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

832
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:42,886
Let go!

833
01:24:48,276 --> 01:24:50,684
They're club hauling.

834
01:24:50,779 --> 01:24:53,021
Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars!

835
01:24:53,114 --> 01:24:54,822
Hard a port!

836
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:08,162
Keep her steady, man.

837
01:25:14,553 --> 01:25:16,261
- Now!
- Fire!

838
01:25:16,347 --> 01:25:18,304
Fire all!

839
01:25:27,066 --> 01:25:29,059
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

840
01:26:15,742 --> 01:26:19,526
- We need more ideas, lass!
- It's your turn!

841
01:26:19,662 --> 01:26:22,829
- We need us a devil's dowry!
- We'll give them her!

842
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:26,367
She's not what they're after.

843
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:29,249
The medallion.

844
01:26:51,028 --> 01:26:53,982
Strike your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

845
01:26:54,073 --> 01:26:56,778
Hands, grapnels at the ready!

846
01:26:56,868 --> 01:26:58,860
Prepare to board!

847
01:27:33,155 --> 01:27:35,444
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

848
01:27:35,533 --> 01:27:38,285
Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!

849
01:27:38,369 --> 01:27:41,489
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

850
01:28:11,278 --> 01:28:12,393
Below!

851
01:28:32,175 --> 01:28:33,254
Thanks very much.

852
01:28:46,773 --> 01:28:48,565
Jack!

853
01:28:49,318 --> 01:28:50,776
Bloody empty!

854
01:29:07,128 --> 01:29:08,705
That's not very nice.

855
01:29:13,217 --> 01:29:15,543
- Where is the medallion?
- Wretch!

856
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:21,179
Where is dear William?

857
01:29:22,143 --> 01:29:23,388
Will.

858
01:29:26,398 --> 01:29:27,856
Elizabeth!

859
01:29:31,278 --> 01:29:32,938
Monkey!

860
01:29:38,619 --> 01:29:40,446
I can't move it!

861
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,997
Elizabeth!

862
01:29:56,220 --> 01:30:00,088
- Thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.

863
01:30:00,183 --> 01:30:02,756
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

864
01:30:03,978 --> 01:30:06,979
Gents! Our hope is restored!

865
01:30:42,977 --> 01:30:46,975
Any of you so much
as thinks the word "parley",

866
01:30:47,065 --> 01:30:49,816
I'll have your guts for garters!

867
01:30:57,951 --> 01:30:59,113
Will.

868
01:30:59,744 --> 01:31:01,737
You godless pirate!

869
01:31:02,122 --> 01:31:03,949
Welcome back, miss.

870
01:31:04,207 --> 01:31:06,745
You took advantage of our hospitality
last time.

871
01:31:06,835 --> 01:31:10,334
It holds fair now you return the favor.

872
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:17,132
Barbossa!

873
01:31:19,139 --> 01:31:21,013
Will.

874
01:31:22,935 --> 01:31:24,975
She goes free!

875
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:27,388
What's in your head, boy?

876
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,023
She goes free.

877
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:33,312
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

878
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:36,692
Don't do anything stupid.

879
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,942
You can't. I can.

880
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:45,279
Like that.

881
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,910
- Who are you?
- No one. He's no one.

882
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:52,171
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

883
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:54,464
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.

884
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:59,012
My name is Will Turner!
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

885
01:31:59,098 --> 01:32:01,636
His blood runs in my veins.

886
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:05,889
It's the spitting image of old
Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.

887
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,937
On my word, do as I say,

888
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:12,187
or I'll pull this trigger,
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

889
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:15,526
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

890
01:32:15,615 --> 01:32:18,450
- Elizabeth goes free!
- Yes, we know that one.

891
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:20,527
Anything else?

892
01:32:22,455 --> 01:32:26,073
And the crew. The crew
are not to be harmed.

893
01:32:30,505 --> 01:32:32,047
Agreed.

894
01:32:51,277 --> 01:32:55,606
Barbossa, you lying bastard.
You swore she'd go free.

895
01:32:55,698 --> 01:32:59,696
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.
I agreed she'd go free.

896
01:32:59,785 --> 01:33:02,739
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

897
01:33:09,003 --> 01:33:13,416
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

898
01:33:14,634 --> 01:33:17,635
So I'll be havin' that dress back
before you go.

899
01:33:21,933 --> 01:33:24,092
I always liked you.

900
01:33:27,105 --> 01:33:29,431
Goes with your black heart.

901
01:33:30,526 --> 01:33:32,518
It's still warm.

902
01:33:35,572 --> 01:33:37,612
Off you go.

903
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,193
Come on.

904
01:33:43,205 --> 01:33:44,949
Too long.

905
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:57,459
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

906
01:33:59,055 --> 01:34:02,092
Jack. Jack!

907
01:34:03,226 --> 01:34:04,768
Did you not notice?

908
01:34:04,853 --> 01:34:09,432
That be the same island that we made
you governor of on our last little trip.

909
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:12,063
I did notice.

910
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:16,405
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape.

911
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:18,483
But I doubt it.

912
01:34:20,953 --> 01:34:23,409
Off you go.

913
01:34:23,497 --> 01:34:25,988
Last time you left me a pistol
with one shot.

914
01:34:26,167 --> 01:34:29,951
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?

915
01:34:30,046 --> 01:34:32,038
Bring it forward.

916
01:34:34,425 --> 01:34:39,550
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

917
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:44,218
It'll be one pistol as before, and you
can be the gentleman and shoot the lady,

918
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:46,884
and starve to death yourself.

919
01:35:10,588 --> 01:35:14,170
That's the second time
I've watched that man take my ship.

920
01:35:16,636 --> 01:35:20,799
You were marooned on this island before.
We can escape in the same way.

921
01:35:20,973 --> 01:35:23,809
To what point and purpose, young missy?

922
01:35:23,893 --> 01:35:29,766
The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

923
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:31,684
Unlikely.

924
01:35:31,776 --> 01:35:35,145
...young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

925
01:35:37,282 --> 01:35:39,524
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

926
01:35:39,743 --> 01:35:44,072
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company.

927
01:35:44,164 --> 01:35:46,869
You sacked Nassau port
without even firing a shot.

928
01:35:46,959 --> 01:35:49,876
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

929
01:35:51,839 --> 01:35:53,582
How did you escape last time?

930
01:36:00,264 --> 01:36:04,725
Last time I was here
a grand total of three days.

931
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:07,514
Last time...

932
01:36:08,773 --> 01:36:12,059
the rum runners
used this island as a cache.

933
01:36:12,151 --> 01:36:15,105
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

934
01:36:15,196 --> 01:36:18,696
From the looks of things,
they've long been out of business.

935
01:36:18,783 --> 01:36:23,860
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

936
01:36:23,955 --> 01:36:25,948
So that's it, then?

937
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:30,451
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow.

938
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:35,794
You spent three days
lying on a beach drinking rum.

939
01:36:38,262 --> 01:36:41,927
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

940
01:36:50,107 --> 01:36:53,274
We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs

941
01:36:53,361 --> 01:36:55,353
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho

942
01:36:56,114 --> 01:36:57,489
Yo ho, yo ho

943
01:36:57,573 --> 01:37:00,111
A pirate's life for me

944
01:37:00,201 --> 01:37:02,110
I love this song!

945
01:37:05,123 --> 01:37:07,246
Really bad eggs!

946
01:37:12,088 --> 01:37:14,081
When I get the Pearl back,

947
01:37:14,174 --> 01:37:18,338
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,
and we'll sing it all the time.

948
01:37:18,428 --> 01:37:22,177
You will be the most fearsome pirates
in the Spanish Main.

949
01:37:22,266 --> 01:37:24,258
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

950
01:37:25,185 --> 01:37:28,555
The entire ocean.
The entire world!

951
01:37:29,565 --> 01:37:33,100
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is.

952
01:37:33,194 --> 01:37:35,981
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

953
01:37:36,072 --> 01:37:39,523
That's what a ship needs.
But what a ship is...

954
01:37:41,035 --> 01:37:44,819
What the Black Pearl really is...

955
01:37:45,665 --> 01:37:47,658
is freedom.

956
01:37:49,711 --> 01:37:50,742
Jack...

957
01:37:50,837 --> 01:37:55,665
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

958
01:37:56,426 --> 01:37:57,589
Oh, yes.

959
01:37:57,677 --> 01:38:02,174
But the company is infinitely better
than last time.

960
01:38:02,265 --> 01:38:07,343
And the scenery has definitely improved.

961
01:38:07,438 --> 01:38:08,896
Mr. Sparrow!

962
01:38:08,981 --> 01:38:13,026
I'm not entirely sure I've had enough
rum to allow that kind of talk.

963
01:38:14,695 --> 01:38:16,688
I know exactly what you mean, love.

964
01:38:23,996 --> 01:38:25,539
To freedom!

965
01:38:28,292 --> 01:38:30,285
To the Black Pearl!

966
01:38:59,283 --> 01:39:00,314
No!

967
01:39:00,576 --> 01:39:03,411
Not good! Stop!

968
01:39:03,496 --> 01:39:05,702
Not good! What are you doing?

969
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:08,541
You've burned all the food,
the shade, the rum.

970
01:39:08,626 --> 01:39:11,960
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?

971
01:39:12,046 --> 01:39:16,625
One, because it is a vile drink that
turns respectable men into scoundrels.

972
01:39:16,968 --> 01:39:20,052
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

973
01:39:20,138 --> 01:39:22,380
The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.

974
01:39:22,474 --> 01:39:26,056
Do you think there is the slightest
chance they won't see it?

975
01:39:26,144 --> 01:39:27,722
But why is the rum gone?

976
01:39:29,064 --> 01:39:32,599
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two,

977
01:39:32,693 --> 01:39:36,737
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

978
01:39:43,037 --> 01:39:47,165
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

979
01:39:47,249 --> 01:39:49,242
Well, it bloody is now!

980
01:39:56,676 --> 01:39:59,381
There'll be no living with her
after this.

981
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:01,427
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

982
01:40:01,514 --> 01:40:05,097
You're safe now. We will return
to Port Royal immediately,

983
01:40:05,185 --> 01:40:07,177
not go gallivanting after pirates.

984
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:09,263
Then we condemn him to death.

985
01:40:10,273 --> 01:40:15,694
The boy's fate is regrettable, but
so is his decision to engage in piracy.

986
01:40:15,779 --> 01:40:18,982
To rescue me. To prevent anything
from happening to me.

987
01:40:19,074 --> 01:40:23,368
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion.

988
01:40:23,453 --> 01:40:29,124
The Pearl was listing to scuppers after
the battle. She won't make good time.

989
01:40:29,209 --> 01:40:33,124
Think about it. The Black Pearl.

990
01:40:33,214 --> 01:40:36,998
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

991
01:40:37,677 --> 01:40:40,168
How can you pass that up?

992
01:40:41,556 --> 01:40:45,968
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.

993
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:49,679
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this for me.

994
01:40:49,772 --> 01:40:51,895
As a wedding gift.

995
01:40:51,983 --> 01:40:54,141
Elizabeth?

996
01:40:54,235 --> 01:40:56,773
Are you accepting
the Commodore's proposal?

997
01:40:59,658 --> 01:41:00,689
I am.

998
01:41:01,117 --> 01:41:04,652
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around!

999
01:41:06,957 --> 01:41:09,709
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

1000
01:41:12,254 --> 01:41:16,466
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1001
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:19,966
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1002
01:41:20,054 --> 01:41:26,057
Then contemplate all possible meanings
of the phrase "silent as the grave".

1003
01:41:26,269 --> 01:41:29,934
- Do I make myself clear?
- Inescapably clear.

1004
01:41:33,818 --> 01:41:37,270
Shiver me timbers.

1005
01:41:37,363 --> 01:41:39,403
Cotton here says you missed a bit.

1006
01:41:43,787 --> 01:41:46,953
You knew William Turner.

1007
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:50,041
Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.

1008
01:41:51,086 --> 01:41:53,834
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1009
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:56,582
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1010
01:41:57,801 --> 01:42:00,802
He said it wasn't right with the Code.

1011
01:42:00,888 --> 01:42:03,889
That's why he sent off
a piece of the treasure to you.

1012
01:42:05,643 --> 01:42:07,968
He said we deserved to be cursed,

1013
01:42:09,146 --> 01:42:11,222
and remain cursed.

1014
01:42:11,315 --> 01:42:14,233
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.

1015
01:42:14,318 --> 01:42:20,024
But, as you can imagine, that didn't
sit too well with the Captain.

1016
01:42:20,116 --> 01:42:22,868
That didn't sit too well
with the Captain at all.

1017
01:42:22,952 --> 01:42:26,571
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1018
01:42:29,167 --> 01:42:35,881
So what the captain did, he strapped
a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1019
01:42:35,966 --> 01:42:37,460
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1020
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:43,055
Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was
sinking into the crushin' black oblivion

1021
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:46,307
of Davy Jones' locker!

1022
01:42:47,186 --> 01:42:51,848
It was only after that we learned
we needed his blood to lift the curse.

1023
01:42:51,941 --> 01:42:54,266
That's what you call ironic.

1024
01:42:59,156 --> 01:43:01,149
Bring him.

1025
01:43:07,081 --> 01:43:09,157
I don't care for the situation.

1026
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,786
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1027
01:43:12,879 --> 01:43:16,213
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1028
01:43:16,299 --> 01:43:19,964
I go in and get Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1029
01:43:20,053 --> 01:43:26,139
Your mates return to the Dauntless
and blast them with your cannons.

1030
01:43:26,226 --> 01:43:28,515
What do you have to lose?

1031
01:43:28,604 --> 01:43:31,605
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1032
01:43:32,733 --> 01:43:37,525
Now, to be honest, there's a risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1033
01:43:37,613 --> 01:43:41,527
which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.

1034
01:43:41,617 --> 01:43:45,662
- It's for your own safety.
- I don't care, I have to tell him!

1035
01:43:45,746 --> 01:43:48,866
The pirates are cursed!
They can't be killed!

1036
01:43:48,958 --> 01:43:55,210
He's already informed of that. A mermaid
flopped up on deck and told the story.

1037
01:43:55,298 --> 01:43:58,299
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1038
01:44:08,937 --> 01:44:13,017
No reason to fret. A prick of the
finger, a few drops of blood...

1039
01:44:13,108 --> 01:44:18,529
No mistakes this time. He's only
half-Turner. We spill it all!

1040
01:44:20,824 --> 01:44:23,494
Guess there is reason to fret.

1041
01:44:37,216 --> 01:44:42,840
- Beg your pardon.
- Begun by blood. By blood...

1042
01:44:46,101 --> 01:44:47,761
Jack!

1043
01:44:47,852 --> 01:44:50,937
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

1044
01:44:51,565 --> 01:44:53,771
Where's Elizabeth?

1045
01:44:54,151 --> 01:44:59,394
Safe, like I promised. She's set to
marry Norrington, like she promised,

1046
01:44:59,489 --> 01:45:01,897
and you get to die for her
like you promised.

1047
01:45:01,992 --> 01:45:07,413
So we're all men of our word, except
for Elizabeth, who is a woman.

1048
01:45:07,498 --> 01:45:09,989
Shut up! You're next!

1049
01:45:12,503 --> 01:45:17,331
- You don't want to be doing that.
- No, I think I do.

1050
01:45:18,968 --> 01:45:21,008
Your funeral.

1051
01:45:24,223 --> 01:45:27,924
- Why don't I want to be doing it?
- Because...

1052
01:45:28,937 --> 01:45:33,765
The HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1053
01:45:33,858 --> 01:45:38,651
is floating just offshore
waiting for you.

1054
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:49,322
What are we doing here?

1055
01:45:50,167 --> 01:45:53,536
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1056
01:45:53,629 --> 01:45:59,216
We catch 'em in a crossfire
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1057
01:45:59,885 --> 01:46:06,339
I meant, why aren't we doing
what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?

1058
01:46:06,434 --> 01:46:11,345
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1059
01:46:13,524 --> 01:46:15,932
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1060
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:18,809
Hear me out, mate.

1061
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:22,855
Order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best,

1062
01:46:22,951 --> 01:46:27,412
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your
aunt... There you are with two ships.

1063
01:46:27,497 --> 01:46:29,704
The makings of your own fleet.

1064
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:33,410
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship and who's to argue?

1065
01:46:33,504 --> 01:46:36,458
But what of the Pearl?

1066
01:46:36,548 --> 01:46:41,341
Name me captain, I'll sail under your
colors and give you 10% of me plunder

1067
01:46:41,428 --> 01:46:48,178
and you get to introduce yourself
as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

1068
01:46:48,269 --> 01:46:52,219
And in exchange you want me
not to kill the whelp.

1069
01:46:52,315 --> 01:46:57,475
Not at all. By all means,
kill the whelp. Just not yet.

1070
01:46:57,570 --> 01:47:02,481
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1071
01:47:05,996 --> 01:47:07,573
For instance...

1072
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:12,701
after you've killed Norrington's men.

1073
01:47:12,794 --> 01:47:14,372
Every...

1074
01:47:14,463 --> 01:47:16,123
last...

1075
01:47:16,214 --> 01:47:17,625
one.

1076
01:47:27,393 --> 01:47:31,307
You've planned this ever since
you learned my name.

1077
01:47:32,106 --> 01:47:33,814
Yeah.

1078
01:47:35,109 --> 01:47:37,351
I want 50% of your plunder.

1079
01:47:37,445 --> 01:47:38,643
- 15.
- 40.

1080
01:47:38,738 --> 01:47:40,197
25.

1081
01:47:40,865 --> 01:47:44,281
I'll buy you the hat.
A really big one.

1082
01:47:45,078 --> 01:47:46,905
Commodore.

1083
01:47:49,332 --> 01:47:51,491
We have an accord.

1084
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:54,499
All hands to the boats!

1085
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,298
Apologies. You give the orders.

1086
01:47:59,593 --> 01:48:03,092
Gents... take a walk!

1087
01:48:08,268 --> 01:48:10,427
Not to the boats?

1088
01:49:08,748 --> 01:49:10,787
Hold fire.

1089
01:49:13,711 --> 01:49:17,127
This is like what the Greeks
done at Troy.

1090
01:49:17,924 --> 01:49:22,919
Except they was in a horse,
instead of dresses. Wooden horse.

1091
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:38,227
A moment, please.

1092
01:49:41,323 --> 01:49:43,067
Elizabeth?

1093
01:49:45,578 --> 01:49:50,952
I want you to know I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1094
01:49:51,542 --> 01:49:54,116
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1095
01:49:54,211 --> 01:49:59,799
But a good decision, if made for the
wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.

1096
01:50:08,768 --> 01:50:10,476
Lieutenant.

1097
01:50:28,998 --> 01:50:30,824
Elizabeth?

1098
01:50:32,293 --> 01:50:34,700
Are you there?

1099
01:50:35,838 --> 01:50:38,411
Are you even listening to me?

1100
01:51:05,661 --> 01:51:07,737
What have you done?

1101
01:51:08,747 --> 01:51:11,369
Stop that! I already feel like a fool.

1102
01:51:12,376 --> 01:51:14,665
You look nice, though.

1103
01:51:18,299 --> 01:51:20,706
I look nice?

1104
01:51:56,547 --> 01:51:59,797
I must admit, Jack, I thought
I had you figured

1105
01:51:59,883 --> 01:52:03,087
but it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1106
01:52:03,178 --> 01:52:08,054
I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man
you can trust to be dishonest.

1107
01:52:08,142 --> 01:52:12,638
Honestly, it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1108
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:18,769
You can never predict when they're going
to do something incredibly... stupid.

1109
01:52:51,979 --> 01:52:56,273
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters!

1110
01:53:01,072 --> 01:53:02,815
Right.

1111
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:06,198
What would you eat first?

1112
01:53:06,286 --> 01:53:10,449
We should decide now so we're ready
when the time comes.

1113
01:53:35,608 --> 01:53:37,647
What was that?

1114
01:53:59,591 --> 01:54:00,670
Miss Elizabeth!

1115
01:54:21,322 --> 01:54:22,864
Make for the ship! Move!

1116
01:54:32,291 --> 01:54:34,118
To the ship!

1117
01:54:36,879 --> 01:54:38,753
Row, men!

1118
01:55:16,295 --> 01:55:18,252
You can't beat me, Jack.

1119
01:55:42,698 --> 01:55:44,904
That's interesting.

1120
01:55:54,877 --> 01:55:56,916
I couldn't resist, mate.

1121
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:04,396
Sorry!

1122
01:57:13,041 --> 01:57:15,164
What now, Jack Sparrow?

1123
01:57:15,252 --> 01:57:20,756
Are we to be two immortals, locked
in an epic battle until Judgment Day?

1124
01:57:21,467 --> 01:57:23,590
Or you could surrender.

1125
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:53,531
All of you with me. Will is in that cave
and we must save him.

1126
01:57:53,625 --> 01:57:56,198
Ready, and... heave!

1127
01:58:02,885 --> 01:58:04,794
I need your help. Come on!

1128
01:58:04,887 --> 01:58:07,722
Any port in a storm.

1129
01:58:07,806 --> 01:58:10,262
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.

1130
01:58:10,351 --> 01:58:14,016
- Are you gonna leave Jack?
- Jack owes us a ship.

1131
01:58:14,271 --> 01:58:17,475
- There's the Code to consider.
- The Code?

1132
01:58:18,985 --> 01:58:23,232
You're pirates. Hang the Code
and hang the rules!

1133
01:58:23,322 --> 01:58:25,648
They're more like guidelines.

1134
01:58:29,495 --> 01:58:31,618
Bloody pirates!

1135
01:58:43,093 --> 01:58:45,251
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1136
01:58:45,345 --> 01:58:47,801
They're stealing our ship.

1137
01:58:47,889 --> 01:58:49,716
Bloody pirates!

1138
01:58:51,727 --> 01:58:53,601
Boarders away.

1139
01:59:01,904 --> 01:59:03,731
Come on!

1140
01:59:29,808 --> 01:59:31,801
Me eye!

1141
01:59:51,122 --> 01:59:53,198
I'll teach you the meaning of pain.

1142
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:55,532
You like pain?

1143
01:59:56,627 --> 01:59:58,786
Try wearing a corset.

1144
02:00:08,556 --> 02:00:10,798
Whose side is Jack on?

1145
02:00:10,892 --> 02:00:13,217
At the moment?

1146
02:00:48,264 --> 02:00:50,138
No fair!

1147
02:01:13,457 --> 02:01:17,751
Ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot.

1148
02:01:18,504 --> 02:01:21,421
He didn't waste it.

1149
02:01:46,116 --> 02:01:48,239
I feel...

1150
02:01:52,205 --> 02:01:54,613
cold.

1151
02:02:55,855 --> 02:02:58,013
Parley?

1152
02:02:58,482 --> 02:03:02,611
- The ship is ours, gentlemen.
- Huzzah!

1153
02:03:08,701 --> 02:03:11,371
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1154
02:03:48,701 --> 02:03:50,741
We should return to the Dauntless.

1155
02:03:53,206 --> 02:03:56,907
Your fiancé will want to know
you're safe.

1156
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:10,504
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1157
02:04:10,599 --> 02:04:12,841
that was it.

1158
02:04:13,811 --> 02:04:18,473
Now, I'd be much obliged
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1159
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:25,479
I'm sorry, Jack.

1160
02:04:27,575 --> 02:04:32,735
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1161
02:04:47,262 --> 02:04:49,468
Jack Sparrow...

1162
02:04:50,265 --> 02:04:52,721
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1163
02:04:53,393 --> 02:04:56,597
...for your crimes against the Crown.

1164
02:04:57,940 --> 02:05:02,400
Said crimes being numerous in quantity
and sinister in nature.

1165
02:05:03,112 --> 02:05:06,730
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith:

1166
02:05:06,824 --> 02:05:09,445
Piracy, smuggling...

1167
02:05:09,535 --> 02:05:11,741
This is wrong.

1168
02:05:11,829 --> 02:05:16,871
Commodore Norrington is bound
by the law, as are we all.

1169
02:05:17,126 --> 02:05:20,495
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1170
02:05:20,588 --> 02:05:24,253
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England,

1171
02:05:24,342 --> 02:05:29,585
sailing under false colors,
arson, kidnapping, looting,

1172
02:05:29,681 --> 02:05:33,631
poaching, brigandage, pilfering,

1173
02:05:33,727 --> 02:05:38,188
depravity, depredation
and general lawlessness.

1174
02:05:39,816 --> 02:05:46,733
For these crimes, you are sentenced
to be hung by the neck until dead.

1175
02:05:48,075 --> 02:05:50,447
May God have mercy on your soul.

1176
02:05:50,536 --> 02:05:52,694
Governor Swann.

1177
02:05:52,788 --> 02:05:54,745
Commodore.

1178
02:05:55,332 --> 02:05:57,539
Elizabeth.

1179
02:05:57,626 --> 02:06:02,335
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you...

1180
02:06:03,841 --> 02:06:05,964
I love you.

1181
02:06:19,482 --> 02:06:21,060
Watch yourself!

1182
02:06:21,484 --> 02:06:22,943
Marines!

1183
02:06:23,028 --> 02:06:25,020
I can't breathe.

1184
02:06:25,447 --> 02:06:26,692
Elizabeth!

1185
02:06:29,868 --> 02:06:31,528
Move!

1186
02:07:44,863 --> 02:07:49,359
I thought we might have to endure
some ill-conceived escape attempt,

1187
02:07:49,451 --> 02:07:51,443
but not from you.

1188
02:07:51,536 --> 02:07:54,739
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1189
02:07:54,831 --> 02:07:59,624
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?

1190
02:07:59,711 --> 02:08:02,333
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.

1191
02:08:04,132 --> 02:08:09,293
If this means the hangman will earn two
pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.

1192
02:08:09,388 --> 02:08:11,131
My conscience will be clear.

1193
02:08:11,223 --> 02:08:14,224
You forget your place, Turner.

1194
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:20,267
It's right here, between you and Jack.

1195
02:08:23,736 --> 02:08:26,061
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1196
02:08:27,615 --> 02:08:31,483
Lower your weapons.
Put them down!

1197
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:39,537
So this is where your heart truly lies?

1198
02:08:40,879 --> 02:08:42,706
It is.

1199
02:08:51,432 --> 02:08:55,014
I'm feeling good about this.

1200
02:08:55,102 --> 02:08:57,510
We've all arrived at a special place.

1201
02:08:57,605 --> 02:09:02,895
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1202
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:07,650
I want you to know
that I was rooting for you, mate.

1203
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:09,649
Know that.

1204
02:09:12,787 --> 02:09:15,029
Elizabeth.

1205
02:09:16,416 --> 02:09:19,867
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1206
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:21,836
I'm sorry.

1207
02:09:24,382 --> 02:09:26,422
Will.

1208
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:29,960
Nice hat.

1209
02:09:30,681 --> 02:09:32,424
Friends.

1210
02:09:34,768 --> 02:09:39,726
This is the day that you will always
remember as the day that...

1211
02:09:44,987 --> 02:09:47,443
Idiot. He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1212
02:09:49,867 --> 02:09:51,694
Sail ho!

1213
02:09:59,293 --> 02:10:01,666
What's your plan of action?

1214
02:10:02,589 --> 02:10:04,415
Sir!

1215
02:10:08,219 --> 02:10:11,920
Perhaps on the rare occasion,
pursuing the right course

1216
02:10:12,015 --> 02:10:14,257
demands an act of piracy.

1217
02:10:14,684 --> 02:10:18,267
Piracy itself can be the right course.

1218
02:10:22,776 --> 02:10:24,816
Mr. Turner.

1219
02:10:29,825 --> 02:10:32,779
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1220
02:10:38,584 --> 02:10:41,040
This is a beautiful sword.

1221
02:10:43,047 --> 02:10:44,956
I expect the man who made it

1222
02:10:45,049 --> 02:10:49,462
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1223
02:10:51,473 --> 02:10:53,216
Thank you.

1224
02:10:56,061 --> 02:10:58,978
Commodore! What about Sparrow?

1225
02:11:00,857 --> 02:11:05,151
I think we can afford to give him
one day's head start.

1226
02:11:10,242 --> 02:11:12,531
So...

1227
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:16,074
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1228
02:11:17,625 --> 02:11:21,325
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1229
02:11:22,421 --> 02:11:24,461
No.

1230
02:11:28,678 --> 02:11:30,552
He's a pirate.

1231
02:12:07,218 --> 02:12:10,254
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the Code?

1232
02:12:10,346 --> 02:12:14,213
We figured they were more
actual... guidelines.

1233
02:12:18,604 --> 02:12:20,147
Thank you.

1234
02:12:21,232 --> 02:12:23,439
Captain Sparrow.

1235
02:12:26,863 --> 02:12:29,152
The Black Pearl is yours.

1236
02:12:44,339 --> 02:12:50,129
On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands
to braces! Let go and haul to run free!

1237
02:12:51,722 --> 02:12:55,340
Now... bring me that horizon.

1238
02:13:02,692 --> 02:13:05,361
And really bad eggs

1239
02:13:07,989 --> 02:13:10,397
Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!
