2
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:27,032
When he didn't come to the office,
10:30, 11:00...

3
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,624
...I called the house.

4
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:32,123
Catharine...

5
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,957
...he went in his sleep,
so peacefully.

6
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:39,460
The doctor said if you slept
next to him...

7
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:42,258
...you wouldn't even have known.

8
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:45,552
You couldn't have done anything.

9
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:58,897
Mrs. Petersen.

10
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:02,442
- Catharine, let me come up with you.
- No.

11
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:05,191
You get some rest, Sara.

12
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,299
Nice blouse, Alex.
- Has been for years, Michael.

13
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:26,633
I'm late. I spent the whole morning
going over obituaries.

14
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:28,345
The whole morning?

15
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:31,383
<i>Yeah. Detroit Free Press on your list?
April 12th.</i>

16
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:34,760
I don't roll out of bed
and read obituaries before coffee.

17
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:38,305
Wasn't this guy a capo for Marangano
a few years back?

18
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,809
- So?
- So...

19
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:43,766
...two guys die within four days
of each other. What does that say?

20
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:47,989
No pattern. This guy could've been
a hit, but Marangano died in his sleep.

21
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:50,482
He stopped breathing.
They ran a full...

22
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,486
- Not now.
Is that what Bruce thinks?

23
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:53,693
Alex.

24
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:58,035
A government pouch to someone's
home is illegal. Worse, it's expensive.

25
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:01,827
Well, my contribution
to the federal deficit.

26
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:09,544
And let go of this Marangano thing.
People die in their sleep. Even dons.

27
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,677
It was a hit!
Hey, keep it down.

28
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,172
He ran trash collection
for half of Jersey.

29
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,019
- You don't die in your sleep of...
Ondine's Curse.

30
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:20,851
"Damage of unknown origin to the part
of the brain that controls breathing."

31
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,850
It's rare. It's real. It happens.

32
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:27,854
Yeah, I'm here six years, it never
happened. You do a run on it?

33
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,072
- This the only one?
- It can't be connected.

34
00:06:34,244 --> 00:06:38,408
This guy's not Mafia. He's some
millionaire publisher from New York.

35
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:39,910
"Cause of death unknown.

36
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,120
Evidence suggests unexplained
interruption of breathing.

37
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:45,584
Consider possibility of Ondine's Curse.

38
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:50,501
Sam Petersen, age 60. Survived
by his wife of four months, Catharine...

39
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:55,007
...age 31."
- And I had to go back a year to get that.

40
00:06:56,433 --> 00:07:01,676
Alex, it's the only one. Believe me.
Believe me, there's nothing there.

41
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:20,863
I've got it sitting right here
in front of me.

42
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:25,703
Walter, you see, I don't know how
to read the goddamn instructions.

43
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,129
I'm only 5 fucking years old.

44
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:33,795
Now, you be my daddy,
and you tell me how to use it.

45
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,592
Nice and simple.

46
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:42,603
Oh, you're goddamn right I'm serious.
But my bride is here for our luncheon.

47
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:45,688
Well, I've never been
anybody's daddy neither.

48
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:50,685
But if you want me to pop for 200,000
units of this little plastic turd here...

49
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:53,270
...I suggest that you start faking it.

50
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:58,028
<i>How's that wife of yours?
- She don't look so good today.</i>

51
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:01,702
<i>- She's the best-looking gal in Dallas.
- She looks kind of scrag.</i>

52
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,280
<i>Scraggly, my ass.</i>

53
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,248
Write some of these instructions
in English.

54
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,587
<i>- Maybe you can find a market for this.
- I'm on top of it.</i>

55
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,841
Yeah, okay, yeah. So long, then.

56
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,806
Marielle, you think anybody's gonna
be interested in a thing like this?

57
00:08:19,974 --> 00:08:25,265
It's about winning, Ben.
Everybody's interested in winning.

58
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,107
They forgot that they're
making this toy for kids.

59
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,228
The instructions are too complicated.

60
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:36,858
Hot damn!

61
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:00,530
I gotta be the world's
number one airhead.

62
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,910
Be gone five days, and I'm packing
half of Neiman Marcus here.

63
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:08,742
Marielle?

64
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:10,742
Yeah, hon?

65
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:14,331
How come we run out of brandy
so quick, hon?

66
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:18,046
Didn't I see a fresh bottle
in the cabinet?

67
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:30,432
Right again, hon.

68
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:55,870
Marielle, I've explained to Etta
that this will is valid in all respects.

69
00:10:56,045 --> 00:11:00,423
Any contest here would just be
a waste of time and money.

70
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,508
My time.

71
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:04,171
My money.

72
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:10,345
What, a man cuts his only sister out of
his will two months after marrying a...?

73
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:12,096
Younger woman?

74
00:11:14,314 --> 00:11:17,480
You know something, Etta,
your husband is right.

75
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,022
Ben had no quarrel with you.

76
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:23,444
Only the way you felt about me.

77
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:27,403
I think, if he were here...

78
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:31,161
...he'd regret what he'd done.

79
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,869
Martin?

80
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,915
What are the tax consequences
if I make a small gift?

81
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:42,331
Young lady...

82
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:47,174
Marielle is going to go back
to Charleston...

83
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:52,803
...and she doesn't want any
harsh feelings or needless delays.

84
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:57,186
How small a gift, dear?

85
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:06,605
Something in the mid-six figures?

86
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:21,621
Miss Barnes! Miss Barnes?

87
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:24,798
Miss Barnes, can I look
in your purse, please?

88
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,969
Here she comes!

89
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:41,937
What? You gonna knock over
a liquor store?

90
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:46,687
I was just at the target range.
I'm trying to get certified, that's all.

91
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:51,403
I tell you what.
Send the piece back to Sears.

92
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,622
Remember that Ondine's Curse thing?

93
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:05,382
Another one came up today.

94
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,049
This guy died 10 days ago.

95
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:23,976
Dinner?

96
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:25,561
What?

97
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:30,314
- I said, dinner? Eat? Tonight?
- I have work left.

98
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,574
Fine. Tomorrow?

99
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:36,910
I don't think it's a good idea.
We work together.

100
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,164
What, office policy? What?

101
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,997
Okay. I resign.

102
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,921
I can't afford to lose you.
You're my right arm.

103
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,088
Okay.

104
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,721
What did you say about Ondine's Curse?

105
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:02,219
- It's not Mafia.
- What is it?

106
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:05,813
It's a toy manufacturer from Dallas.

107
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:11,274
He's very rich. He's very clean.
I'll get you a printout tomorrow, okay?

108
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,984
- Good night.
- Good night.

109
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,248
Michael.

110
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,583
Wait up.

111
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:28,161
I'm gonna go with you.

112
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:34,417
Could a Texas toy mogul
have a mob connection?

113
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:37,513
The Texan's a ringer
for that other guy from New York.

114
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:40,469
How's that?
- Well, both older guys, very rich...

115
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:43,679
...each married to a young gal
for a couple of months.

116
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:47,899
- Must be kind of bad for your health.
- Hey, you got a minute?

117
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:01,240
Make some calls to New York, Dallas.
Newspapers, whatever.

118
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:03,572
Let's round up some photos.

119
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,367
Shouldn't be hard.
They were prominent guys.

120
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:09,954
Not the men.

121
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,253
The wives.

122
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,273
Okay.

123
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:39,613
Seattle guidebooks,
Japanese cooking, what next?

124
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:43,119
- Rare coins.
- What sort of rare coins?

125
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:49,077
Something general for the beginner, then
something more particular. Perhaps...

126
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,961
...Italy, the 19th century.

127
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,166
Before the city-states were unified
or after?

128
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:57,046
I don't know.
Which would be more...

129
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:00,634
...unusual?

130
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:05,508
Northwest Indians. Which tribes?

131
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:09,055
Coast Salish, for certain.
Whatever else you have.

132
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:12,018
Tlingit, Bella Coola, Kwakiutl.

133
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,398
My primary interest is in totem poles.

134
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:17,191
What are you,
cramming for a game show?

135
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:25,404
No, I'll take it. Thank you.

136
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:53,799
Come here. Come here, children.
Teachers, let's move them along.

137
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:55,810
Come this way.

138
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:07,151
One million dollars.

139
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:11,190
A very generous offer, Miss Dodd...

140
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:14,454
...but this museum does not sell
places on its board.

141
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:15,951
- Our chairman...
- Yes.

142
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:19,956
I'm sure Mr. McCorey will appreciate
my intentions. Good day.

143
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:26,466
But Margaret,
we want your views on this.

144
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:30,715
Now, I understand you had very
strong feelings about this collection.

145
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:33,296
Mr. McCorey...

146
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:36,511
...I didn't want my first meeting
to be one where I...

147
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:38,180
You disagreed with anybody.

148
00:19:41,274 --> 00:19:44,275
I think it's a mistake to concentrate
so exclusively...

149
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,935
...on the Coast Salish in our acquisitions.

150
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:51,819
You want to be the best at something,
but that's not our role.

151
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,487
And what is, Margaret?

152
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:56,662
We need to compare all the tribes.

153
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:59,916
We study their art to learn about them.

154
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:03,916
We study them
to understand ourselves.

155
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:12,006
These the best pictures?
She doesn't want pictures.

156
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,967
She knows the camera's there.
She turns away.

157
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,679
The Texas one is different,
slimmer body.

158
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:20,177
- It's the way she's stand...
- She's younger.

159
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:23,190
- It's makeup, hair, attitude.
- I think you're wrong.

160
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:24,900
I could be right.

161
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:28,603
The whole m.o., a complex series
of seductions and murders...

162
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,105
...that's not something
you see a woman do.

163
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:36,110
Oh? Which part you figure a woman isn't
up to? The seduction or the murder?

164
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,908
Look, I just want the field assignment.

165
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,489
- Please?
- Listen...

166
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,372
...data analysis is the heart
of what we do here.

167
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:47,914
The best work in this shop
is yours. The best.

168
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,590
- It's a job you were born to do.
- It's a job with green windows!

169
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,548
Bruce, I've been in this office
for six years.

170
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,842
This goddamned government
office with green windows.

171
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:02,097
You want excitement. People
don't look to get it all from their job.

172
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:05,390
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jesus.

173
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:08,235
What do you think it means?
Having a date!

174
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:12,981
When was the last time you rolled in late
on a Monday because of a big weekend?

175
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:16,490
I really can't believe
you're saying this to me!

176
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,365
I have to listen to this shit
from my mother!

177
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,705
What the hell do you think
you are, Bruce?

178
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:29,419
Look, I just...

179
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,874
You're not happy.

180
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:38,216
You're not a happy person.

181
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,425
And you deserve to be, that's all.

182
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:47,353
Bruce, make me happy.

183
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:59,951
Even if you're right, it isn't federal.

184
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:06,079
Whatever you can't fit on the
weekends, make sure you call in sick.

185
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,207
Thanks.

186
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:23,263
She was destroyed by his death.
They were very devoted.

187
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:27,479
Catharine needed to get away,
and she went to Europe.

188
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:31,016
That was over a year ago.
Have you heard from her?

189
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:35,689
I had a postcard from Rome. I had
a lovely note from Vienna, a little gift.

190
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:40,360
All in the first month, or thereabouts.
Anything lately?

191
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:42,612
Only the attorney.

192
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:46,203
He received instructions
to convert the estate into cash...

193
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,286
...and to transfer the funds
to a Swiss account.

194
00:22:49,461 --> 00:22:53,293
No one else in Manhattan,
not a single soul.

195
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:56,668
Everyone says the same thing.
From Chicago, no family...

196
00:22:56,843 --> 00:23:00,259
...they don't know where she lived,
where she worked.

197
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:03,264
Could I have this photograph?

198
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:12,262
I'm sorry.
That must have sounded awful.

199
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:20,110
Sara, it's just that she came out of thin
air, and she vanished back into thin air.

200
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:24,530
- Well, is that against the law?
- It's odd. I find it odd.

201
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:30,870
Sam Petersen is gone.
So is all of his property, his money.

202
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:36,079
And if I loved him as much as you did,
I'd find it very odd indeed.

203
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:46,131
That's Felice Baciocchi
and her sister Elisa.

204
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:52,518
You probably looked all this up
just to impress me.

205
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:56,724
Did it work?

206
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:03,689
Well, you know, I really did wonder.
You seem almost too good to be true.

207
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,494
I thought of checking up on you.

208
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:14,791
Not a bad thought.

209
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:18,663
After all, I could be
practically anybody.

210
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:22,169
Dangerous not to check people out.

211
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,503
I did.

212
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:29,762
And what did you find?

213
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:36,567
I found that you went to Mount
Holyoke, you studied anthropology...

214
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:40,019
...and I found...

215
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:43,192
...we're a lot alike.

216
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:49,995
We like Italy, and we like coins.

217
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,741
And we like to live alone.

218
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,831
You never talk about that.

219
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:03,133
I don't know why I never married.

220
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,006
I have a serviceable list of reasons.

221
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,766
Take out my reasons
and polish them every once in a while.

222
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:15,389
I kept on growing out
in all these...

223
00:25:15,564 --> 00:25:19,727
...peculiar and idiosyncratic directions.

224
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:24,400
I'd put on a little bristle here
and a bristle there...

225
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,696
...and sort of...

226
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:29,073
...turned myself into a porcupine.

227
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:37,666
- What?
- Well, it's just such an old joke.

228
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,208
How do two porcupines...

229
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,752
...make love?

230
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:47,633
Very carefully.

231
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:58,720
To the left, right around this corner.
You'll find it.

232
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:12,194
It's kind of you to make time
in your busy schedule for me.

233
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,328
No trouble at all.

234
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:18,158
So have you thought at all
about what I said?

235
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:21,288
Uh-huh. You know something?

236
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:24,997
That very same idea occurred to me
right after the funeral.

237
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:27,131
I even hired a detective.

238
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:31,595
Sent him over to Charleston,
where she said her people were at.

239
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:35,465
There was nothing at all.
No family, not even a trace.

240
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:39,639
Why didn't you come forward, Etta?

241
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:43,106
Ben was gone.
I couldn't bring him back.

242
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:46,691
I thought, "It'll be in the papers."
I didn't want a big scandal.

243
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:49,484
Okay, about the will, Etta.

244
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:52,942
Rice Institute was the only
other beneficiary, wasn't it?

245
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,870
Yes. Ben was gracious and...

246
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:58,790
And I bet you wondered
if Marielle got caught...

247
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:02,243
...Rice might just take back
that little gift she gave you.

248
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,262
You're looking a little peaked, dear.

249
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,135
Can I buy you a tan?

250
00:27:57,307 --> 00:28:02,728
I've been coming here about this time
of year since I was 5 years old.

251
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:08,148
And every year, when we'd leave...

252
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:11,355
...I'd feel this sense of...

253
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:15,365
...Ioss, I suppose.

254
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:26,285
Always promised myself
I'd live here someday.

255
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,127
Why don't you?

256
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,339
Why don't we?

257
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,873
What is this thing?
You almost broke my tooth.

258
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:15,880
Medic alert.
I'm allergic to penicillin.

259
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,769
We're done. We're all done.

260
00:29:34,946 --> 00:29:36,938
Last hand, you guys.

261
00:29:37,114 --> 00:29:40,032
Herb's got it, honey.
He's got that look.

262
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:44,534
That's the look?
That's the look.

263
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:46,579
Yeah, I'm done.

264
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,035
You do got it,
you lame son of a bitch.

265
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:57,790
I'll see your 20
and kick you 20.

266
00:29:57,968 --> 00:30:00,638
What is that, suicide?
Some kind of sympathy ploy?

267
00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:04,637
- Called putting up your money. Herbert?
- I got it, Alex. Keep your 40.

268
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:07,765
Kick me back.

269
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,264
Just call. All blue, darling.

270
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:16,437
Remember last week?

271
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:20,444
- I think we're even now, baby.
Yeah, well, I gotta get out of here.

272
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,569
Hold on a second, will you, please?

273
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:26,785
- Guys, come on.
Take it easy!

274
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:29,328
This is my money. I've got about...

275
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,501
I got about 40, 50, $60 here.

276
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,746
I already got this money spent.

277
00:30:34,922 --> 00:30:37,413
Yeah, what are you buying?
New underwear?

278
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:43,426
You took Alex out once, didn't you?
Yeah, Redskins game.

279
00:30:43,597 --> 00:30:46,349
So how'd it go?

280
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,226
Skins lost.

281
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:53,397
Hi.

282
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:56,056
You want your neck rubbed?

283
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:58,523
No.

284
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:03,817
I want my neck rubbed.

285
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:09,987
- Oh, man.
- Thinking about your Borgia lady?

286
00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:11,624
Uh-huh.

287
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:16,080
- You figure out how she hits them?
- Oh, Christ, I don't know.

288
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:20,418
It could be methadone.
It leaves a negligible trace.

289
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:23,718
You know how many men over 50...

290
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:26,804
...married women under 40
in the last four months?

291
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,426
No.

292
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,558
Neither do I.

293
00:31:32,562 --> 00:31:35,978
Now try the top 30 cities.

294
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:39,105
You tell me.

295
00:31:43,573 --> 00:31:46,408
Exactly a zillion.

296
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:49,490
And that's the easy part.

297
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:53,281
Now try crossing that
against millionaires.

298
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,747
Get photos of the women.

299
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:59,123
And you could use more computer time.

300
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:01,171
No, I'm there.

301
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,340
I'm down to six ladies.

302
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:06,752
That includes the two
I got this week.

303
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,337
You can't be traveling
all over the country...

304
00:32:09,515 --> 00:32:12,267
No, I gotta check it out.

305
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:14,724
I gotta check them out.

306
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:20,563
What, are you scared for me?

307
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:23,900
You're full of shit, Bruce.

308
00:32:25,365 --> 00:32:27,653
Call you from Denver.

309
00:32:28,284 --> 00:32:30,360
Maybe Seattle.

310
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:32,864
See you.

311
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,872
<i>Pull your cars
as far forward as possible.</i>

312
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:39,119
<i>Stop your engine.</i>

313
00:32:39,754 --> 00:32:42,459
<i>Set your emergency brake.</i>

314
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:58,782
Everything's fine.
You can get dressed.

315
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:04,457
Doctor, I almost forgot.
I have this recurring tonsillitis and...

316
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,955
...well, with this Seattle weather...

317
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,457
What usually works for you?

318
00:34:09,634 --> 00:34:11,508
Penicillin.

319
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,720
I think she said her degree
was in anthropology.

320
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:18,132
Vassar or Smith or...

321
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,726
- And she was originally from...?
- New England, I think.

322
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:25,313
Maybe it wasn't. It's funny.
I see her three times a week and...

323
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:28,230
Sally, is Mrs. McCorey across the hall?

324
00:34:28,403 --> 00:34:32,021
Please check. I have a reporter
who'd like some background on her.

325
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,606
I'd rather not bother her,
if you don't mind.

326
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:38,990
I don't like to impose on my subjects
till I have something written up...

327
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:41,655
...you know, in case they want
to make changes.

328
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,660
Margaret isn't in this morning.

329
00:34:43,835 --> 00:34:46,587
William, this is Mrs. Talley.

330
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,712
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

331
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:51,497
<i>She's with the Post-Intelligencer.</i>

332
00:34:51,718 --> 00:34:55,134
They're doing a piece on our
more prominent women volunteers.

333
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:59,089
I know your managing editor well.
You're on metro desk, features?

334
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:03,265
I'm not with the paper, actually.
I'm freelance.

335
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:05,845
I was hoping they would
pick up an article.

336
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:07,648
I'm working in the storeroom.

337
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:09,810
- Why don't we talk there?
- Fine.

338
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:15,779
Please don't touch anything down here.

339
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,117
- Your home phone?
- Well, I don't live here in town.

340
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:24,743
- So you're staying at the...?
- The Hilton.

341
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,827
- Look...
- Airport?

342
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:28,378
Downtown.

343
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:31,255
Just one question.

344
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:35,753
Why did you lie back there
about the paper?

345
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,807
I'm sorry. I really am, I...

346
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:43,510
See, I'm just starting out.

347
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:47,102
<i>I thought an article on powerful
women might sell to Cosmo...</i>

348
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:50,351
<i>...or Woman 's Day, and so...
- Oh, yeah, I see, I see.</i>

349
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:55,147
I never had to prove myself like that.

350
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:58,364
It must be hard for you.

351
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:04,955
My wife's a very private person,
and I respect that.

352
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:10,168
But let me talk to her, and we'll see
if we can't help you out.

353
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:14,174
That's very understanding of you.

354
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,810
Anything else?

355
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:38,321
I think that's it, thanks.

356
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:47,114
Hey! Hey, Leo, will you fix that screen?

357
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,960
Okay, I'll fix it!

358
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,704
- All right!
Come on, man!

359
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,871
- I'll fix it!
Another movie on survival?

360
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,752
<i>Just because
you can 't see a suspect...</i>

361
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,550
<i>... doesn 't mean he can 't see you.</i>

362
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:02,676
There's a resemblance, but I've seen
strangers who look like twins.

363
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,845
You're looking for a reason to kiss
this off because you can't stomach it.

364
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:09,142
Yeah, what are you looking for?

365
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:12,563
Why do you wanna bury this lady?
Two guys die of some curse?

366
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:16,315
Ondine's Curse. They died in their sleep.
They stopped breathing.

367
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:19,024
When McCorey dies
of the same thing, call me.

368
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:21,523
You said the wives were out of town.

369
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,869
She poisoned them.
She put it in some...

370
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:27,527
Something she thought
they'd drink or eat.

371
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,658
These boys were autopsied.

372
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,000
You got cops in New York or Dallas
wanna dig up the bodies?

373
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:36,835
No, but you want me to tell one
of the richest men in this state...

374
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,794
...that some Fed thinks
his wife's a murderer...

375
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,836
...when nobody thinks
there's a homicide.

376
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:45,511
You're right. You solved
the whole case from your desk.

377
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,840
Why not take the rest of the day off?

378
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:51,013
You're absolutely right.
Hello, Mrs. McCorey?

379
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:55,179
Would you come to the station
and tell us if you ever killed anybody?

380
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,774
No, ma'am, we don't have any evidence.

381
00:37:57,944 --> 00:38:01,479
I just spent the whole morning
showing you the evidence!

382
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:04,699
If that's what the Justice Department
calls evidence...

383
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:08,201
...then that is the scariest part
of this whole conversation.

384
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,449
The thing is, I know I'm right.

385
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:35,349
So, what do you think?

386
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,516
The playing's better than the piano.

387
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:39,684
Oh, right.

388
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,810
I'll get a tuner out here tomorrow.

389
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,741
Oh, a young woman stopped
by the museum.

390
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:53,079
She's researching an article about you.

391
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:57,199
I liked her.
She seemed really very sweet.

392
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,255
Fix you a gin?

393
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,004
Ma'am.

394
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:12,050
Check again.

395
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:15,974
Look, she told my husband
she was here waiting for a call.

396
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,099
She was here.

397
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:23,101
Checked out this afternoon.
Transferring to the Inn at the Market.

398
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,983
Perhaps I could call for you.

399
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,936
Shit!

400
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,314
Margaret?

401
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,983
Yeah, I'm up here!
- Oh, I'll come up.

402
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,194
No, no, no.
I'll be down in just a minute.

403
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,784
I thought you were fishing.
No luck?

404
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:50,747
I was gonna call the lawyer
about the board meeting.

405
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,842
I think it's a mistake, sweetheart.

406
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,763
Shit.

407
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,972
It's a family business.

408
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:09,270
You put me on another board,
there'll just be conflict and resentment.

409
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,654
You're my wife.
I want you with me.

410
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,483
I do like the way you say that.

411
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,744
- Where'd they find him?
- Look, Agatha Christie.

412
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,626
He didn't die of any breathing disease.
Just a good old-fashioned heart attack.

413
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,630
- Did they do an autopsy?
- Yes...

414
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,047
...they did, and a toxicology screen.

415
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:38,043
Great, that covers about 60
compounds at the outside.

416
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:42,256
You think she wouldn't
know what to avoid?

417
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,683
Anaphylactic shock looks
like cardiac arrest.

418
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,849
Was he allergic to something?

419
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,228
- Bee venom? Antibiotics?
- Bee venom!

420
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:56,191
Bee venom.
You're not gonna believe this...

421
00:42:56,406 --> 00:43:00,155
...but I overlooked that possibility.
Boy, that's gonna be my ass.

422
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,990
She's left town,
and you don't know where.

423
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:07,155
Lady, there's been no homicide.
Why should I care where she went?

424
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,246
Enough to know she's left.
You're scared shitless.

425
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:14,756
They're gonna find out about me
and wonder why you didn't check it out.

426
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:19,178
If you got a complaint, go file it.
Otherwise, please, go fuck yourself.

427
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,156
It's not a reason.

428
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:43,695
I was in the room with him.
He was four feet away from me.

429
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:47,363
- And what were you supposed to do?
- I don't know.

430
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:51,034
I just...

431
00:43:52,003 --> 00:43:53,663
...should have...

432
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,453
...said it. Told him.
- He'd have believed you?

433
00:43:56,674 --> 00:43:59,675
He would have had a chance.
I didn't give him a chance!

434
00:43:59,844 --> 00:44:04,222
He would've gone straight to her,
then you're blown and she's gone.

435
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,881
And maybe he's alive.

436
00:44:11,689 --> 00:44:14,015
Alex, you don't quit your job...

437
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:15,900
...six years...

438
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:19,402
...to go chasing after some phantom!

439
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:25,861
She's not a phantom.

440
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:34,540
Come on. Come on!

441
00:44:34,712 --> 00:44:39,208
We got her. I think we got her.
I think we finally got her.

442
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:02,778
Hi.
Hi.

443
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,318
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

444
00:45:08,412 --> 00:45:09,906
This is from me.

445
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:12,203
I already have my ticket to Hawaii.

446
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:14,450
That's your ticket back.

447
00:45:16,128 --> 00:45:18,833
What makes you so sure
she's even there?

448
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:24,510
Michael says the lady at the ticket
counter in Seattle recognized her photo.

449
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:28,261
Who's to say she didn't fly out of Hawaii
under any name at all?

450
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:30,508
Maybe she did.

451
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,266
Where else am I gonna start?

452
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:42,234
I heard you sold all your stuff.
- Yeah.

453
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:44,942
- What'd you get for the BMW?
- Well...

454
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:48,484
...I got 5900 for it.
Blue Book said 66...

455
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:52,409
...but the salesman was wearing
a bow tie and I was in a hurry.

456
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,949
Would you do me a favor?

457
00:45:58,045 --> 00:45:59,954
Would you get this back to Sears?

458
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:08,927
- Don't underestimate this woman.
- She's not about guns.

459
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:12,264
You want to catch her,
you gotta think like she thinks.

460
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:13,809
I think.

461
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:17,388
And you figure you know her, huh?
Why she does it?

462
00:46:17,731 --> 00:46:19,355
Tell me.

463
00:46:19,524 --> 00:46:24,732
When I was a kid, my father...
I told you this story, though, didn't I?

464
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:26,986
My dad had quite a temper.

465
00:46:27,157 --> 00:46:30,241
He used to take off after me
with this spatula, you know.

466
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:34,159
Stainless steel pancake turner.
Man, that thing stung like hell.

467
00:46:34,331 --> 00:46:37,285
One of these times,
he chased me down the hall...

468
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:41,456
...and he got me into my bedroom,
and he was beating the crap out of me.

469
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:42,875
Man.

470
00:46:43,048 --> 00:46:45,965
And he stood up, keeled over and died.

471
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:51,049
I figure Margaret,
or whatever her name is...

472
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:55,220
...has some deep resentment
against older men and...

473
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,513
Are you buying this?

474
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:00,641
I can't believe you really went for it.

475
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:03,024
Goddamn it.

476
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:06,271
Don't you know? No one knows
why anyone does anything.

477
00:47:06,446 --> 00:47:10,194
I know she's obsessed with killing
and you're obsessed with her.

478
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:14,152
What worries me is that
you might be as wacky as she is.

479
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:18,330
I'll be back with a tan.

480
00:47:32,472 --> 00:47:36,516
Over here, all of you going
to Kilauea, line up here please.

481
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:36,154
Whoo.

482
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:35,338
We are standing at the newest
place on this planet.

483
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:40,971
It's like nowhere on Earth.

484
00:49:43,685 --> 00:49:46,176
I love this place!

485
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:54,147
Everybody comes to Hawaii
for the sand, for the beach...

486
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,484
...but to put a hotel here,
it would cost a fortune.

487
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:03,319
Do you know what?

488
00:50:03,496 --> 00:50:06,497
My bankers say I'm insane.

489
00:50:09,127 --> 00:50:13,789
God, in the right spot,
it would be fantastic!

490
00:50:31,107 --> 00:50:34,392
You always been impatient, lady?
I mean, your whole life?

491
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:38,697
Mr. Shin, in four weeks
I've given you $600.

492
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:41,534
You, by way of contrast,
have given me zip.

493
00:50:42,118 --> 00:50:45,202
I'm surprised you can find
your office in the morning.

494
00:50:45,371 --> 00:50:49,832
You always sarcastic like that?
You were sarcastic little baby?

495
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:52,918
You look for lady for four weeks, huh?

496
00:50:53,087 --> 00:50:55,874
One time I look for somebody
for 18 years.

497
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:58,918
Quite a recommendation.

498
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:01,716
Persistence.

499
00:51:01,887 --> 00:51:06,715
Besides, can't find such a pretty lady
for buck and a half a week.

500
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:10,226
- Need incentive bonus.
- No, just show me what you've got.

501
00:51:10,604 --> 00:51:12,763
What do you mean, huh?
I got nothing.

502
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,107
Mr. Shin, any man that would ask me
for a price increase...

503
00:51:16,277 --> 00:51:19,646
...without anything to deliver
would be kind of stupid.

504
00:51:19,822 --> 00:51:22,028
No point in insulting
your intelligence.

505
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:25,242
I'd rather do business on a basis
of mutual respect.

506
00:51:25,744 --> 00:51:27,618
That's good.

507
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:30,279
- I like respect.
- Fine.

508
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,125
Where is she?

509
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:35,129
All right, ladies,
before we re-enter the pool...

510
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:40,716
...let's review the most important rule:
Never race your bubbles to the surface.

511
00:51:40,884 --> 00:51:47,172
It can cause lung expansion, which
can result in air in the bloodstream.

512
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:51,477
This can produce an embolism,
which can result in...

513
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:55,228
- You all right? Maybe you should sit out.
- A very agonizing death.

514
00:51:57,234 --> 00:52:00,021
Now then, ladies, let's get in the pool.

515
00:52:06,618 --> 00:52:08,825
Good. Okay, ladies,
come around here.

516
00:52:09,037 --> 00:52:11,991
Come on. Come on, all of you.

517
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:17,207
We're going to pair up and practice
breathing two on the same regulator.

518
00:52:17,379 --> 00:52:20,131
This would be necessary
when one runs out of air.

519
00:52:20,298 --> 00:52:22,587
Now pair up. You and you.
You and you.

520
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:28,466
That's right. Take the regulator and give
it to your partner for emergency air.

521
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,807
Partners? Don't worry.
I'm not really contagious.

522
00:52:31,977 --> 00:52:35,926
My friend promised me she'd
be my partner, so...

523
00:52:36,147 --> 00:52:40,097
Well, that leaves me odd man out,
doesn't it?

524
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,194
- Rennie Walker.
- Jessica Bates.

525
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:47,234
- Jessica Bates, I owe you a beer.
- Take you up on it.

526
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:50,409
Now you take the regulator
in your right hand...

527
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:54,534
...you take two breaths from it,
and then you give it to your partner.

528
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:58,491
She takes two breaths from it,
and then you take it back...

529
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:02,039
...and you breathe into it twice.

530
00:53:02,632 --> 00:53:06,416
On five, you blow out.
Don't hold her nose so tight.

531
00:53:06,594 --> 00:53:09,761
You have to close her nose,
but don't rip it off her face.

532
00:53:09,931 --> 00:53:12,256
And keep your hand on the back
of her neck.

533
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:15,885
If her airway closes,
she will not be able to breathe.

534
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:18,387
You're not taking this personally,
are you?

535
00:53:18,564 --> 00:53:19,975
Don't worry.
- Okay.

536
00:53:20,149 --> 00:53:22,189
Okay, that's it for this afternoon.

537
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:26,945
Thank you for your participation.
You can all go. Thank you.

538
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,493
What's your name again?

539
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:36,039
- Rennie.
- Rennie.

540
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:42,041
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just hanging out.

541
00:53:42,672 --> 00:53:44,629
Spending my money.

542
00:53:51,847 --> 00:53:53,757
What are you looking at?

543
00:53:53,933 --> 00:53:58,144
Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's just that
we spent most of the day in the pool...

544
00:53:58,312 --> 00:54:01,479
...and you come out looking like that
and I look like this.

545
00:54:01,649 --> 00:54:04,104
I just wondered why that is.

546
00:54:08,114 --> 00:54:10,439
You don't look bad.

547
00:54:10,616 --> 00:54:12,110
New suit might help, though.

548
00:54:12,326 --> 00:54:17,700
Oh, it's just the suit? Great.
I'm on a budget.

549
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,628
What?

550
00:54:24,797 --> 00:54:28,794
What do you say we go up to my room,
have a couple of decent drinks?

551
00:54:28,968 --> 00:54:30,213
All right.

552
00:54:35,015 --> 00:54:38,633
- You married or what?
- Nope.

553
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:42,728
Not at the moment.

554
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:46,479
Thank you. Who's this?

555
00:54:46,652 --> 00:54:48,360
You like that, do you?

556
00:54:48,529 --> 00:54:51,732
Men that look like this,
you usually end up supporting.

557
00:54:51,907 --> 00:54:57,779
His name's Paul Nuytten, and he owns
half a dozen hotels around the world.

558
00:54:57,955 --> 00:55:03,578
Does he have a brother? Cousin?
Young grandfather?

559
00:55:04,419 --> 00:55:07,171
He's having a party tonight.
Do you want to come?

560
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:08,833
What?

561
00:55:09,007 --> 00:55:12,293
He's having a party tonight.
Do you want to come?

562
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:16,336
Oh, I can't. I left all my designer
stuff back in Chicago.

563
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:20,049
Well, that's all right.
You can borrow something of mine.

564
00:55:26,566 --> 00:55:28,808
Could I borrow your hair?

565
00:55:30,195 --> 00:55:31,855
How about your hairdresser?

566
00:55:32,531 --> 00:55:33,693
Sure.

567
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:44,620
- You look pretty.
Thanks.

568
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:46,453
- You gonna be okay?
- I think so.

569
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:48,620
I'll catch you later.

570
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:53,625
Gin and tonic.

571
00:56:01,684 --> 00:56:03,428
Thank you.

572
00:56:42,141 --> 00:56:46,602
Oh, I know this dress,
but who is the woman?

573
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:50,604
Paul Nuytten, my new pal,
Jessica Bates.

574
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:52,483
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Welcome.

575
00:56:52,652 --> 00:56:54,775
Thank you.
You have a beautiful home.

576
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:56,819
Thank you.

577
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:01,657
Would you like to dance?

578
00:57:02,244 --> 00:57:06,574
No. Thanks.
I have new shoes.

579
00:57:27,895 --> 00:57:29,971
Mademoiselle.

580
00:57:30,189 --> 00:57:32,312
Thank you. What's your name?

581
00:57:32,524 --> 00:57:36,059
- Tran.
- Tran?

582
00:57:38,947 --> 00:57:40,607
Rennie.

583
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,450
Tonight you stay?

584
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:51,286
You have a very busy day tomorrow.

585
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,749
You have to polish your boat...

586
00:57:54,588 --> 00:57:56,877
...hunt some wild boar.

587
00:58:00,427 --> 00:58:02,301
Oh, Paul.

588
00:58:03,764 --> 00:58:07,097
You have your little phone book,
lots of numbers.

589
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,772
Why do we keep having
this conversation?

590
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,522
It's you.

591
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,184
It's you I want.

592
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:28,992
All you want is the woman
you haven't slept with.

593
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:32,534
That's not the same as wanting me.

594
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:44,969
Paul.

595
00:58:46,514 --> 00:58:48,388
I need a kiss.

596
00:59:23,635 --> 00:59:25,508
Fresh fish!

597
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:32,888
Aku! Fresh aku! Aku!
Freshest fish!

598
00:59:36,939 --> 00:59:39,098
- Fish! Fish!
That one.

599
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:41,149
- Two pounds.
Hey!

600
00:59:43,154 --> 00:59:45,727
I see you've caught your fish after all.

601
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:49,867
Oh, can't place my face, huh?
Forgetting is useful skill.

602
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:53,535
- I could learn some of that some time.
- Take out your cigarettes.

603
00:59:53,706 --> 00:59:56,375
Take out your cigarettes
and offer me one.

604
00:59:57,335 --> 01:00:01,379
No, thanks. This is federal government.
You don't wanna lose your license.

605
01:00:01,589 --> 01:00:03,795
Point. At the fish.

606
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:06,089
- Say thank you and goodbye.
- Thank you.

607
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:07,630
Goodbye.

608
01:00:15,436 --> 01:00:16,930
Who was that guy?

609
01:00:17,104 --> 01:00:20,354
He's a local, and he's asking me
if the fish is fresh.

610
01:00:26,614 --> 01:00:28,322
<i>- Hello?
Sara?</i>

611
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,859
- Yes?
- Sara, it's Catharine.

612
01:00:32,036 --> 01:00:35,820
- Petersen.
- Catharine!

613
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:39,367
It's been such a long time.
Are you all right?

614
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:43,499
Well, I have a situation actually.

615
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:48,171
Apparently, there's been a woman
reporter asking questions about me...

616
01:00:48,343 --> 01:00:50,003
...and Sam.

617
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,717
Has anyone like that been
around to see you?

618
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:57,801
<i>Well, yes. There was a young woman
by here about six months ago.</i>

619
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,475
But she was from
the federal government.

620
01:01:02,566 --> 01:01:07,109
Listen, Sara, I really must go
right now...

621
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:09,437
...but I'll phone you later to catch up.

622
01:01:09,615 --> 01:01:12,699
It's been a long time,
and I would like to keep in touch.

623
01:01:12,868 --> 01:01:14,362
I'll talk to you later, bye.

624
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:44,444
I'll do it. I'll do it!

625
01:04:45,996 --> 01:04:50,040
The goddamn gauge said half full.
How come there was no air in it?

626
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,618
I was supposed to check these things.

627
01:05:00,218 --> 01:05:03,753
If I was a little further out
or had my back turned...

628
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:07,431
You scared the shit out of me.

629
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:11,890
Thanks for not having your back turned.

630
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:44,679
I'll be right down.

631
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:04,947
Hey!

632
01:06:06,534 --> 01:06:09,107
You really like those things?

633
01:06:10,037 --> 01:06:12,611
My second husband was addicted.

634
01:06:12,832 --> 01:06:15,453
Second husband?
How many have you had?

635
01:06:15,626 --> 01:06:20,003
Lots. That's how I got rich.

636
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:23,259
Once wasn't enough to get rich?

637
01:06:23,717 --> 01:06:25,840
Rich is hard.

638
01:06:26,887 --> 01:06:30,221
You never really figure
you're quite there.

639
01:06:30,808 --> 01:06:32,551
That sounds pretty romantic.

640
01:06:35,354 --> 01:06:36,932
Well...

641
01:06:38,065 --> 01:06:40,022
...I used to think of it as my job.

642
01:06:41,652 --> 01:06:44,107
Making myself appealing.

643
01:06:45,531 --> 01:06:47,903
I was a professional.

644
01:07:08,136 --> 01:07:12,798
L... I loved every one of them.

645
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:18,012
Deeply.

646
01:07:20,315 --> 01:07:21,893
Honestly.

647
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:29,355
It wouldn't have worked any other way.

648
01:07:37,332 --> 01:07:39,206
You like him.

649
01:07:42,921 --> 01:07:45,210
Paul. You like him.

650
01:07:49,511 --> 01:07:51,550
Go for it.

651
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:54,678
He wants you to.

652
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:02,096
He needs somebody now...

653
01:08:02,273 --> 01:08:04,349
...who knows how to commit.

654
01:08:09,113 --> 01:08:12,897
They're arguing over some woman
named Pelé, like the soccer player.

655
01:08:13,076 --> 01:08:16,242
One argues that she's going
on the warpath on Tuesday.

656
01:08:16,412 --> 01:08:18,654
The other guy says,
"No, next Wednesday."

657
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:20,907
Six guys got into the same argument...

658
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:24,951
...like they all know the same woman.
- No, no. Pelé is a goddess.

659
01:08:25,129 --> 01:08:29,875
Goddess of devastation.
She lives in a volcano. Kilauea.

660
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:32,968
And every so often she makes fire.

661
01:08:33,137 --> 01:08:34,596
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

662
01:08:34,764 --> 01:08:36,922
- Coffee?
No.

663
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:40,219
Thank you.
You okay?

664
01:08:40,645 --> 01:08:44,345
I don't feel too well actually.
I think I'll go back to the hotel.

665
01:08:48,194 --> 01:08:50,732
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

666
01:08:56,577 --> 01:09:00,527
- I'll drive you home.
- Don't be ridiculous.

667
01:09:00,706 --> 01:09:02,995
It's only a headache.

668
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:08,126
I'll call you tonight.
We'll do something tomorrow.

669
01:09:08,297 --> 01:09:13,754
Look, you and Jessie
go on with your afternoon. Okay?

670
01:09:14,845 --> 01:09:16,304
And have a nice time.

671
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:48,123
Tran, did he work
for your family in Indochina?

672
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:49,623
Huh?

673
01:09:50,255 --> 01:09:55,629
It's just that you and he seem so close.
Did he work for another family?

674
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:58,379
Your wife's?

675
01:10:01,308 --> 01:10:03,384
It's just that I sense...

676
01:10:04,061 --> 01:10:06,302
She was killed.

677
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,887
She was only 19.

678
01:10:09,066 --> 01:10:10,560
I'm sorry.

679
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:15,613
And I'm sorry I made you think of it.

680
01:10:16,615 --> 01:10:21,241
It's a rare gift to see things
that others cannot.

681
01:10:21,953 --> 01:10:24,871
It drives some people away.

682
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:31,286
I don't think people like you to know
things before they're ready to tell you.

683
01:10:31,463 --> 01:10:34,998
So I should just learn
to keep my mouth shut.

684
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:43,723
Won't you see some of the island?

685
01:10:46,686 --> 01:10:48,478
Yes, I'd like that.

686
01:11:13,046 --> 01:11:16,296
Why are you smiling?
- Because you have a look on your face.

687
01:11:16,466 --> 01:11:18,624
Look?
- Like you want to ask something...

688
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:21,339
...then you don't.
You ought to just ask it.

689
01:11:21,512 --> 01:11:25,462
No, I was just thinking,
why hasn't this woman married?

690
01:11:25,642 --> 01:11:28,595
Attractive, intelligent.

691
01:11:28,978 --> 01:11:31,018
Very, very strong.

692
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:34,059
- She is.
- She?

693
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:36,060
But I'm talking about you.

694
01:11:38,237 --> 01:11:39,613
So...

695
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:42,984
...what about you and men?

696
01:11:44,827 --> 01:11:46,238
Bad timing.

697
01:11:46,662 --> 01:11:49,497
Maybe a little bit of fear?

698
01:11:51,459 --> 01:11:53,416
Tell you something about that.

699
01:11:53,628 --> 01:11:55,751
It's very, very provocative.

700
01:13:04,406 --> 01:13:05,948
Such a strange place.

701
01:13:06,116 --> 01:13:09,615
The sap from the trees cools the lava.

702
01:13:12,706 --> 01:13:14,449
- Paul?
- Huh.

703
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:17,916
- About Rennie.
- I'm not with Rennie.

704
01:13:18,837 --> 01:13:20,794
I'm with you.

705
01:13:23,133 --> 01:13:24,711
I can't compete with her.

706
01:13:24,885 --> 01:13:27,210
There is no necessity.

707
01:13:30,348 --> 01:13:36,517
I have to know whatever this is
is something honest and just for me.

708
01:13:37,272 --> 01:13:38,980
Look at me.

709
01:13:40,233 --> 01:13:42,107
Look at me.

710
01:13:44,154 --> 01:13:46,193
Decide.

711
01:14:10,722 --> 01:14:12,002
Here?

712
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:16,174
I mean, can we turn
out the lights or something?

713
01:14:48,467 --> 01:14:51,552
No knock? Come into
a person's office, no knock?

714
01:14:51,721 --> 01:14:53,049
I'm sorry.

715
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:57,968
I knock. I come to your office, I knock.
Where were you born, anyway?

716
01:14:58,144 --> 01:15:01,477
- Wisconsin. Should I come back later?
- No.

717
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:05,230
Too late to come back later.
You already no knock.

718
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:07,310
What you want, Wisconsin?

719
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:11,188
Mr. Shin, my name is Rennie Walker.

720
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:17,113
This woman befriended me.

721
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:20,414
And now I think she's seeing my fiancé.

722
01:15:24,211 --> 01:15:25,789
I really must know.

723
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,872
No, no, no. I no do this kind of work.
Not respectable.

724
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:34,006
Mr. Shin, I'll tell you
two things about me.

725
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:36,670
I'm very rich.

726
01:15:38,517 --> 01:15:40,842
And I'm very wealthy.

727
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:16,894
I'm sorry about Jessie.
I thought it was what you wanted.

728
01:17:20,201 --> 01:17:23,072
Do you understand, Rennie?

729
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,916
Long drive back.

730
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:34,039
Fix me a drink?

731
01:17:57,822 --> 01:18:00,906
Rennie? Rennie?

732
01:18:02,493 --> 01:18:06,076
Come in. I want you to.

733
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:09,616
Why tonight, after all this time?

734
01:18:09,834 --> 01:18:10,948
Huh?

735
01:18:12,461 --> 01:18:15,498
I think we've waited long enough.

736
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:29,902
Just a minute.

737
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:37,910
- Morning.
- Good morning.

738
01:19:45,929 --> 01:19:49,629
You left this in the Jeep
the other day.

739
01:19:49,808 --> 01:19:53,508
So you drove all the way
over just to deliver a sweater?

740
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:55,596
No. Not exactly.

741
01:19:56,648 --> 01:20:00,942
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

742
01:20:04,656 --> 01:20:06,483
I have something to tell you.

743
01:20:07,867 --> 01:20:09,860
Is something wrong?

744
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,574
Last night, Rennie and I,
we decided to marry.

745
01:20:21,589 --> 01:20:25,005
I want you to be okay with this.

746
01:20:26,886 --> 01:20:29,175
I'll be okay.

747
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:04,620
I'll be out there in a minute.

748
01:21:11,055 --> 01:21:12,514
Woman in love.

749
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:19,012
- Do you really doubt it?
- No. I helped you get here, didn't I?

750
01:21:19,438 --> 01:21:22,439
When you put us together,
it made him want you more.

751
01:21:22,608 --> 01:21:25,941
So I guess you could say my
wedding gift was the groom.

752
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:30,863
I meant it as an exchange of gifts.

753
01:21:31,909 --> 01:21:35,242
Something you could take
with you from your time with Paul.

754
01:21:35,412 --> 01:21:39,280
Well, in that case, I still owe you one.

755
01:21:42,336 --> 01:21:45,456
- That was a beautiful ceremony.
- Thank you.

756
01:21:45,631 --> 01:21:48,122
It was a lovely ceremony.

757
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:50,675
Open it.

758
01:21:52,346 --> 01:21:55,347
Whatever this is, it means a lot to me.

759
01:22:11,657 --> 01:22:13,945
Black widow.

760
01:22:15,494 --> 01:22:17,782
She mates and she kills.

761
01:22:20,707 --> 01:22:23,494
Your question is, does she love?

762
01:22:24,753 --> 01:22:27,956
It's impossible to answer that...

763
01:22:29,007 --> 01:22:31,083
...unless you live in her world.

764
01:22:37,349 --> 01:22:40,219
Such an intriguing gift.

765
01:22:45,857 --> 01:22:48,858
Makes me wish I had
more to share with you.

766
01:22:51,071 --> 01:22:55,697
- Truth is, I'm sorry it's over.
- The truth is, it's not over yet.

767
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,490
Till then.

768
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:08,037
With your permission, may I have
the pleasure to kiss the lovely bride?

769
01:23:33,112 --> 01:23:34,939
Come in.

770
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,778
Hey, Wisconsin, you knock.
I no recognize you.

771
01:23:43,247 --> 01:23:46,912
- Do you have my pictures?
- Sure.

772
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:52,418
Hey, I see you got married
a little while ago. Congratulations.

773
01:23:54,425 --> 01:23:56,998
Good stuff, huh?

774
01:24:06,395 --> 01:24:10,227
What else do you have
in your desk, Mr. Shin?

775
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:15,394
What do you mean by that? I got a lot
of stuff. I got paper clips. I got menthol.

776
01:24:15,571 --> 01:24:20,316
Condoms even, not it any your
business. Why you ask?

777
01:24:20,785 --> 01:24:24,699
Because you have a choice, Mr. Shin.
You can die or you can die happy.

778
01:24:24,914 --> 01:24:28,329
- Why are you doing this?
- It's in the second drawer. Look!

779
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,078
You have five seconds.

780
01:24:34,798 --> 01:24:36,625
- One...
- Please.

781
01:24:37,092 --> 01:24:39,168
...two...
- Wait! Wait!

782
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:42,548
- Hold on.
...three...

783
01:24:49,354 --> 01:24:50,683
<i>... four.</i>

784
01:24:51,982 --> 01:24:54,651
Hyland, let me see that needle.

785
01:24:56,904 --> 01:24:59,276
Get it to the lab.

786
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:02,325
- Make sure they don't move anything.
- Okay.

787
01:25:07,289 --> 01:25:09,495
I want the whole room dusted.

788
01:25:09,666 --> 01:25:12,537
<i>Anything here for the Herald?
Or just a nothing OD?</i>

789
01:25:12,711 --> 01:25:15,416
If it gets exciting,
I'll find your number.

790
01:25:19,009 --> 01:25:20,966
Now who would you be?

791
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:50,700
I'm glad you came over, Paul.
I need to talk to you.

792
01:25:50,874 --> 01:25:53,579
Don't you think Rennie
left a bit abruptly?

793
01:25:53,752 --> 01:25:58,746
No. Just her usual trip. She sees
her accountant on the mainland.

794
01:25:58,923 --> 01:26:00,667
Investments.

795
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:06,714
Paul, how well do you
think you know me?

796
01:26:07,098 --> 01:26:08,129
Know you?

797
01:26:11,519 --> 01:26:14,520
- A little bit, I guess.
- Would I ever lie to you?

798
01:26:14,731 --> 01:26:17,566
- I don't know.
- Well, I did.

799
01:26:18,192 --> 01:26:20,315
My name is not Jessica Bates.

800
01:26:20,486 --> 01:26:23,357
It's Alex Barnes.
I work for the Justice Department.

801
01:26:26,326 --> 01:26:28,995
Your wife's name
is not Rennie either.

802
01:26:29,162 --> 01:26:32,495
Only, no one seems to know
what her real name is.

803
01:26:32,665 --> 01:26:34,741
- Listen to me.
- This makes no sense.

804
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:39,663
Under three different names, she married
three different men. All wealthy men.

805
01:26:39,881 --> 01:26:43,047
- What are you trying to do?
- Paul, she killed all of them.

806
01:26:43,217 --> 01:26:48,342
She poisoned them. She's left town and
that's when they die, when she's gone.

807
01:26:52,602 --> 01:26:56,434
But she doesn't need my money.
I've seen her portfolio. Bank accounts...

808
01:26:56,606 --> 01:26:59,606
I just told you how she got them.

809
01:27:01,611 --> 01:27:04,979
- I know it sounds like I used you.
- Sounds like?

810
01:27:06,115 --> 01:27:08,606
You can't say that you
didn't know how I felt.

811
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:12,699
That was Jessie, not some cop.

812
01:27:13,873 --> 01:27:19,377
Look, lady, don't feel so bad.
Everybody uses everybody.

813
01:27:21,464 --> 01:27:23,955
Only she does it better, right?

814
01:27:24,133 --> 01:27:27,300
That's what it is, isn't it?
She does it better.

815
01:27:27,469 --> 01:27:31,135
- No, that isn't it.
- And I told myself you could handle it.

816
01:27:31,307 --> 01:27:34,722
- I did!
- Then maybe you can explain our wills.

817
01:27:34,893 --> 01:27:39,223
They leave everything...
Everything to the Cancer Foundation.

818
01:27:39,398 --> 01:27:43,098
Nothing to each other.
It was her idea.

819
01:27:43,277 --> 01:27:46,480
Sound like the woman
you're talking about?

820
01:27:47,364 --> 01:27:49,156
Answer me!

821
01:27:55,038 --> 01:27:58,075
Tell me there is no jealousy.

822
01:27:59,668 --> 01:28:02,159
No jealousy at all.

823
01:28:25,235 --> 01:28:28,734
They said he strangled
in his sleep or something.

824
01:28:32,284 --> 01:28:34,988
Do you know a woman named
Jessica Bates?

825
01:28:35,704 --> 01:28:37,661
I do.

826
01:28:37,831 --> 01:28:42,125
It seems Miss Bates
is a federal agent named Barnes.

827
01:28:42,502 --> 01:28:47,247
And Miss Barnes believes
that you murdered Mr. Nuytten.

828
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:51,219
Paul died last night.

829
01:28:51,386 --> 01:28:55,086
I was in San Francisco.
You can call the hotel.

830
01:28:55,306 --> 01:28:57,216
She thinks you poisoned him.

831
01:28:57,392 --> 01:29:00,808
Something that would take delayed
effect while he slept.

832
01:29:06,025 --> 01:29:08,433
- Did you check our home for the poison?
- No.

833
01:29:08,653 --> 01:29:11,773
There's no probable cause for a warrant.

834
01:29:11,948 --> 01:29:16,111
- I thought you might voluntarily...
- Of course. Yes.

835
01:29:16,286 --> 01:29:18,444
Check everything you want.

836
01:29:21,082 --> 01:29:23,620
And while you're at it...

837
01:29:24,085 --> 01:29:28,581
...Jessica Bates,
or whatever her name is...

838
01:29:29,424 --> 01:29:34,251
...was my husband's lover.
Before and after the wedding.

839
01:29:35,346 --> 01:29:38,715
So while you're searching my home...

840
01:29:41,018 --> 01:29:42,394
Interesting.

841
01:29:42,562 --> 01:29:46,974
We learned that he went to her
apartment yesterday afternoon.

842
01:30:24,478 --> 01:30:26,637
Please, have a seat.

843
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:30,896
You've been more than kind...

844
01:30:31,318 --> 01:30:33,988
...after what you've been through.

845
01:30:36,115 --> 01:30:39,649
Listen, we did find a toxic compound
in Miss Barnes' apartment.

846
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:43,871
Delayed-action poison.

847
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:46,447
Also, we have certain photographs.

848
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:54,250
Photos of Miss Barnes
and your husband.

849
01:30:54,425 --> 01:30:58,885
Those pictures are all my fault. I...

850
01:31:00,681 --> 01:31:04,180
I hired this horrid little man.

851
01:31:05,269 --> 01:31:06,811
How did you get them?

852
01:31:07,354 --> 01:31:09,927
The man you hired
is dead, Mrs. Nuytten.

853
01:31:10,107 --> 01:31:13,606
We assumed of an accidental
overdose of heroin.

854
01:31:14,528 --> 01:31:18,857
Now I'm afraid Miss Barnes has more
than just your husband to answer for.

855
01:31:22,994 --> 01:31:24,738
How well did you know him?

856
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:29,955
Back as far as you can.

857
01:31:31,962 --> 01:31:35,128
Did you know Paul Nuytten?
Were you having a love affair?

858
01:31:36,007 --> 01:31:41,002
Mrs. Nuytten, the Cancer Foundation
flew Mr. Foster to the islands...

859
01:31:41,179 --> 01:31:44,844
...because we seem to have...
Well, something of a situation.

860
01:31:45,016 --> 01:31:49,394
- A situation?
- Yes, it's concerning Mr. Nuytten's will.

861
01:31:49,562 --> 01:31:53,856
It seems that Mr. Nuytten's legal
residence is the state of Florida.

862
01:31:54,025 --> 01:31:55,852
Were you aware of that?

863
01:31:56,027 --> 01:31:57,569
No. Should I be?

864
01:31:58,029 --> 01:32:02,738
Florida has a so-called mortmain
statute, Mrs. Nuytten.

865
01:32:03,118 --> 01:32:08,242
Any bequest to charity in a will
executed within six months of death...

866
01:32:08,414 --> 01:32:10,621
...can be invalidated by the spouse.

867
01:32:13,837 --> 01:32:15,913
- How interesting.
Of course...

868
01:32:16,089 --> 01:32:19,540
...it's no requirement
that you invalidate the gift.

869
01:32:20,718 --> 01:32:25,427
Shortly before his death,
Mr. Foster, my husband...

870
01:32:25,598 --> 01:32:29,133
...expressed reservations
about your organization.

871
01:32:31,437 --> 01:32:34,723
Profound reservations.

872
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:48,821
Miss Barnes called from the jail.

873
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:55,825
I tell her you plan to take long trip.

874
01:33:56,105 --> 01:33:58,430
Treating you...?

875
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:01,025
You okay?

876
01:34:02,945 --> 01:34:05,233
I can't complain.

877
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:09,861
It's a lot of psychological tests.

878
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:13,496
Which I find surprising
for a crime of passion.

879
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:19,330
Not so surprising.

880
01:34:20,504 --> 01:34:24,916
Well, they don't seem to think
your only motive was jealousy.

881
01:34:26,843 --> 01:34:28,635
Not of Paul, anyway.

882
01:34:29,513 --> 01:34:33,261
They seem to think
your obsession was...

883
01:34:34,726 --> 01:34:36,220
...with me.

884
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:40,270
They think you started out as
an ambitious federal agent...

885
01:34:42,317 --> 01:34:45,686
...and you became obsessed by this...

886
01:34:46,738 --> 01:34:48,731
...phantom.

887
01:34:49,407 --> 01:34:51,483
And then...

888
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,153
...you chased her...

889
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,657
...and you chased her...

890
01:34:58,249 --> 01:35:02,377
...and when you thought you'd
never be quick enough to catch her...

891
01:35:02,545 --> 01:35:04,372
I killed him...

892
01:35:04,756 --> 01:35:06,748
...to frame you.

893
01:35:34,118 --> 01:35:36,241
How did you manage it?

894
01:35:36,412 --> 01:35:39,366
What, did you leave town
and sneak back?

895
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:44,201
Did you use the same bottle
you put in my place?

896
01:35:44,378 --> 01:35:48,672
You always did have a tendency
to over-think things.

897
01:35:49,383 --> 01:35:54,211
The most important thing about figuring
anything out is knowing when to stop.

898
01:36:01,103 --> 01:36:03,143
You know...

899
01:36:04,649 --> 01:36:08,516
...of all the relationships
I'll look back on...

900
01:36:08,694 --> 01:36:10,936
...in 50 years' time...

901
01:36:15,117 --> 01:36:18,866
...I'll always remember this one.

902
01:36:38,265 --> 01:36:39,973
Hello, Sara.

903
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:44,312
It's good to see you.

904
01:37:12,883 --> 01:37:16,216
I put the poison in Paul's brandy.
You mustn't...

905
01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:18,712
We know. We found it before he did.

906
01:38:27,915 --> 01:38:29,659
Get your cameras, she's here!

907
01:38:29,834 --> 01:38:34,579
Congratulations, that was a brilliant trap.
Are you going back to Washington now?

908
01:38:34,756 --> 01:38:37,081
Were you tipped off
she was here in Hawaii?

909
01:38:37,258 --> 01:38:39,251
Please, give us an answer for the press.

910
01:38:39,427 --> 01:38:42,381
Are you going to testify at the trial?

911
01:38:45,933 --> 01:38:48,140
I will give you the statement.
