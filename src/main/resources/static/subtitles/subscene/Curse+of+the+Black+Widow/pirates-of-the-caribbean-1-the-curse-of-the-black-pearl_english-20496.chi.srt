♫  A pirate's life for me  ♫

♫  Drink up  ♫

9
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:57,598
Quiet, missy.

10
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:00,265
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,035
You don't want to bring them.

12
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,737
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

13
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:07,041
She was singing about pirates.

14
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:08,843
It's bad luck to be singing
about pirates

15
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:10,974
with us mired
in this unnatural fog.

16
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:12,211
Mark my words.

17
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,219
Consider them marked.

18
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:16,583
On your way.

19
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:17,748
Aye, Lieutenant.

20
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,418
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board, too.

21
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:23,224
Even a miniature one.

22
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:26,527
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

23
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:29,625
Think again, Miss Swann.

24
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:32,433
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

25
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:35,566
I intend that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

26
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:39,510
or wears a pirate brand gets
what he deserves.

27
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,514
A short drop and a sudden stop.

28
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,878
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor,

29
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,650
but I'm concerned
about the effect

30
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:53,090
this subject will have
upon my daughter.

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,025
My apologies, Governor Swann.

32
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,120
Actually,
I find it all fascinating.

33
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:59,825
Yes.
That's what concerns me.

34
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:29,760
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

35
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,199
<font color="#40a040">Lt. Norrington:</font> Man overboard!

36
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,733
Man the ropes.
Fetch a hook.

37
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,635
Haul him aboard.

38
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,876
He's still breathing.

39
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,578
Mary, Mother of God.

40
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:01,454
<font color="#40a040">Gov. Swann:</font> What happened here?

41
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:02,927
It's the powder magazine.

42
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,396
Merchant vessels run
heavily armed.

43
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,735
A lot of good it did them.

44
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,465
Everyone's thinking it.
I'm just saying it.

45
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,133
Pirates.

46
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,666
There's no proof of that.
It's probably an accident.

47
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,643
<font color="#40a040">Lt. Norrington:</font> Rouse the captain immediately.

48
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:24,775
Heave to and take in sail.
Launch the boats.

49
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:30,881
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

50
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:33,016
He'll be in your charge.

51
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,720
Take care of him.

52
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,105
It's okay.

53
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:58,946
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

54
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,544
Will Turner.

55
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,555
I'm watching over you, Will.

56
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:18,363
You're a pirate.

57
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,338
Has he said anything?

58
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:24,571
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

59
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,771
Take him below.

60
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,147

00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:37,979

62
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,447
Are you all right?

63
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,285
Are you decent?

64
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:45,654
Yes.

65
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,522
Yes.

66
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,654
Still abed at this hour?

67
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,198
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

68
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,129
I have a gift for you.

69
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:01,638
Oh, it's beautiful.

70
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,039
Isn't it?

71
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:06,536
May I inquire
as to the occasion?

72
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:09,980
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

73
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:12,377
Go on.

74
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,249
Actually, I...

75
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:21,352
I hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

76
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:22,759
The ceremony?

77
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:25,627
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

78
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,529
I knew it.

79
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:29,898
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

80
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,699
A fine gentleman,
don't you think?

81
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:35,036
He fancies you, you know.

82
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:38,077
Elizabeth?
How's it coming?

83
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:40,578
It's difficult to say.

84
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,047
I'm told it's the latest fashion
in London.

85
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:47,018
Well, women in London
must've learnt not to breathe.

86
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,780
Milord, you have a visitor.

87
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:09,602
Mr. Turner.

88
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,268
Good to see you again.

89
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,936
Good day, sir.

90
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:15,812
I have your order.

91
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:21,745
Well.

92
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:24,085
The blade is folded steel.

93
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:27,354
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

94
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,156
If I may.

95
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:32,921
Perfectly balanced.

96
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,196
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

97
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,738
Impressive.
Very impressive.

98
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,399
Now, now.

99
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:46,571
Commodore Norrington is going
to be very pleased with this.

100
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,843
Do pass my compliments on
to your master.

101
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,444
I shall.

102
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,320
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

103
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:02,425
Elizabeth,
you look absolutely stunning.

104
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,122
Will.

105
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,722
It's so good to see you.

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,098
I had a dream about you
last night.

107
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:09,965
About me?

108
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:12,197
Yes, is that entirely proper
for you--

109
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,399
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

110
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,465
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

111
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:19,569
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

112
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:23,309
At least once more,
Miss Swann, as always.

113
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:24,509
There. See?

114
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,950
At least the boy has a sense
of propriety.

115
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,615
We really must be going.
There you are.

116
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,681
Good day, Mr. Turner.

117
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:36,027
Come along.

118
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:39,423
Good day.

119
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:43,493
Elizabeth.

120
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,349
What-- hey.

121
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,294
Hold up, there, you.

122
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:21,424
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat at the dock.

123
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:25,295
And I shall need to know
your name.

124
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,572
What do you say
to three shillings,

125
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,576
and we forget the name?

126
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:37,477
Welcome to Port Royal,
Mr. Smith.

131

Present arms!

132
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:51,517
This dock is off limits
to civilians.

133
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,388
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't know.

134
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,987
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

135
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,394
There's some sort of high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort.

136
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,734
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen such as yourselves

137
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:09,570
did not merit an invitation?

138
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:12,634
Someone has to make sure
this dock stays off limits.

139
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:14,509
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

140
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,744
But it seems to me
that a ship like that

141
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:22,151
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

142
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:25,088
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true.

143
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:28,525
But there's no ship as can match
the Interceptor for speed.

144
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:29,686
I've heard of one.

145
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:33,027
It's supposed to be very fast.
Nigh uncatchable.

146
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:34,862
The Black Pearl.

147
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:41,634
Well, there's no real ship
as can match the Interceptor.

148
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:43,675
Black Pearl is a real ship.

149
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,540
No.
No, it's not.

150
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,306
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.

151
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,813
You've seen it?

152
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,745
Yes.

153
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:51,784
You haven't seen it.

154
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,045
Yes, I have.

155
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,350
You've seen a ship
with black sails

156
00:12:56,422 --> 00:13:00,825
that's crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil

157
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:04,226
that Hell itself
spat him back out?

158
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,491
No.

159
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,032
No.

160
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,432
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

161
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:10,400
Oh.

162
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,631
No ship that's not crewed
by the damned

163
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:15,572
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell spat him out

164
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,701
could possibly have black sails,
therefore couldn't be

165
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:20,075
any other ship
than the Black Pearl.

166
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:22,910
Is that what you're saying?

167
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:24,108
No.

168
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:27,050
Like I said,
there's no real ship

169
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,611
as can match the Interceptor.

170
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,185
Hey!

171
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,658
You!

172
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:36,854
Get away from there!

173
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:39,295
You don't have permission
to be there.

174
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,629
I'm sorry.
It's such a pretty boat.

175
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:42,793
Ship.

176
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:43,858
What's your name?

177
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,496
Smith.
Or Smithy, if you like.

178
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:49,939
What's your purpose
in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?

179
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,135
Yeah.
And no lies.

180
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,611
Well, then, I confess.

181
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,705
It is my intention to
commandeer one of these ships,

182
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:58,682
pick up a crew in Tortuga,
raid, pillage, plunder,

183
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,513
and otherwise pilfer
my weaselly black guts out.

184
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:04,886
- I said no lies.
- I think he's telling the truth.

185
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:08,620
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

186
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:13,097
Unless you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

187
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:17,136
<font color="#4040f0">(Slow orchestral music playing)</font>

188
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:25,206
May I have a moment?

189
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:29,447
<font color="#4040f0">(Breathing heavily)</font>

190
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,779
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

191
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:43,726
I apologize if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

192
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:48,756
This promotion throws
into sharp relief

193
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:52,565
that which I have not yet
achieved.

194
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:56,775
A marriage to a fine woman.

195
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:00,771
You have become
a fine woman, Elizabeth.

196
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,780
I can't breathe.

197
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:06,750
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

198
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,852
And then they made me
their chief.

199
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,954
Elizabeth?

200
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:17,961
Elizabeth!

201
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,964
My God.

202
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:20,760
The rocks!

203
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,358
Sir, it's a miracle
she missed them.

204
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:28,372
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim.

205
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,272
Pride of the King's Navy,
you are.

206
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,245
Do not lose these.

207
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:50,453
What was that?

208
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,521
Make way!

209
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:33,900
I got her!

210
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,130
She's not breathing!

211
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,766
Move!

212
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,783
I never would've thought
of that.

213
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,217
Clearly you've never been
to Singapore.

214
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,917
Where did you get that?

215
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,823
<font color="#40a040">Cdre. Norrington:</font> On your feet.

216
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,227
<font color="#40a040">Gov. Swann:</font> Elizabeth!

217
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:04,525
Are you all right?

218
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:05,968
Yes, I'm fine.

219
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,371
Shoot him.

220
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,376
- Father.
- What?

221
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:15,937
Commodore, do you really
intend to kill my rescuer?

222
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,953
I believe thanks are in order.

223
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:33,191
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we, pirate?

224
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,698
Hang him.

225
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:39,966
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

226
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,165
Well, well.

227
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,640
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

228
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,610
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

229
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,614
Well, I don't see
your ship, Captain.

230
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:52,048
I'm in the market, as it were.

231
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,018
He said he'd come
to commandeer one.

232
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:57,715
Told you he was telling
the truth. These are his, sir.

233
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,556
No additional shot nor powder.

234
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,956
A compass
that doesn't point North.

235
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,538
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

236
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:21,311
You are without doubt the worst
pirate I've ever heard of.

237
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,473
But you have heard of me.

238
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:28,219
Commodore,
I really must protest.

239
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:29,914
Carefully, Lieutenant.

240
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,253
Pirate or not,
this man saved my life.

241
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:34,349
One good deed is not enough
to redeem a man

242
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:35,826
of a lifetime of wickedness.

243
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,125
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

244
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:40,599
Indeed.

245
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,964
Finally.

246
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:43,492
No.

247
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,536
No! Don't shoot!

248
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,594
I knew you'd warm up to me.

249
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,970
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

250
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,474
And my hat.

251
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,741
Commodore.

252
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:58,477
- It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

253
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,781
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

254
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:03,651
Come, come, dear.
We don't have all day.

255
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,385
Now if you'll be very kind.

256
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,869
Easy on the goods, darling.

257
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:28,011
You're despicable.

258
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,105
Sticks and stones, love.

259
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:33,777
I saved your life.
You save mine. We're square.

260
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:37,345
Gentlemen, milady,
you will always remember this

261
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:42,486
as the day that you almost
caught Captain Jack Sparrow.

262
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:01,046
Whoa!

263
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:02,842
Now will you shoot him?

264
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:05,042
Open fire!

265
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:07,211
Hey!

266
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:13,751
On his heels!

267
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,142
<font color="#40a040">Man:</font> Take cover, man!

268
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,806
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

269
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,441
I would hate for him to miss it.

270
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,387
<font color="#40a040">Man:</font> Search upstairs!

271
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,287
<font color="#40a040">Man 2:</font> Look lively, men!

272
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,614
<font color="#4040f0">(Snoring)</font>

273
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,290
Whoa!

274
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:50,085
<font color="#4040f0">(Hiss, donkey brays)</font>

275
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:21,114
Right where I left you.

276
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,184
Not where I left you.

277
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:41,736
You're the one they're hunting.

278
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:44,809
The pirate.

279
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:47,869
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

280
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:51,712
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

281
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:54,548
It would be a shame to
put a mark on your record.

282
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,485
So if you'll excuse me.

283
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:02,558
Do you think this wise, boy?

284
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,756
Crossing blades with a pirate?

285
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:08,095
You threatened Miss Swann.

286
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:13,098
Only a little.

287
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,311
You know what you're doing. I'll
give you that. Excellent form.

288
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,856
But how's your footwork?

289
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:33,983
If I step here.

290
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,025
Very good.

291
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:38,120
And now I step again.

292
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,232
Ta.

293
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,850
That is a wonderful trick.

294
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,759
Except, once again, you are
between me and my way out.

295
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,957
And now you have no weapon.

296
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,947
Who makes all these?

297
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:40,752
I do.

298
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:45,422
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

299
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,692
You need to find yourself
a girl, mate.

300
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:58,299
Or perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

301
00:24:58,377 --> 00:24:59,708
is that you found one

302
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:04,181
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

303
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:06,444
You're not a eunuch, are you?

304
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:09,545
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate,

305
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:10,950
I can kill it!

306
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,256
You cheated.

307
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:30,596
Pirate.

308
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:35,298
Move away.

309
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:36,705
No.

310
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,470
- Please move.
- No.

311
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:41,569
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

312
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,813
This shot is not meant for you.

313
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:59,128
<font color="#40a040">Man:</font> There he is! Over here!

314
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:03,457
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

315
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,265
You've assisted in the capture
of a fugitive.

316
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:09,637
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

317
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:12,233
I trust you will
remember this is the day

318
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:15,940
Captain Jack Sparrow
almost escaped.

319
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:17,504
Take him away.

320
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,965
<font color="#4040f0">(Whistling)</font>

321
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,507
- Can you smell it?
- Come here.

322
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:26,270
- It's marrowbone.
- Come here.

323
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,141
- Want a juicy bone?
- Come here.

324
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:31,045
- Come here, boy!
- Come on.

325
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:35,051
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

326
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,245
Oh, excuse us

327
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,585
if we haven't resigned ourself
to the gallows just yet.

328
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,692
There you go, miss.

329
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:50,393
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

330
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,130
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose.

331
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,764
I must admit,
I wasn't prepared for it.

332
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,799
I meant you being threatened by
that pirate. Sounds terrifying.

333
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:01,367
Oh.

334
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:03,208
Yes, it was terrifying.

335
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,545
But the commodore proposed.
Fancy that.

336
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:10,348
Now, that's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

337
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:13,151
It is a smart match.

338
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,215
He's a fine man.

339
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,685
He's what any woman should dream
of marrying.

340
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:24,030
Well, that Will Turner.
He's a fine man, too.

341
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:26,035
That is too bold.

342
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:30,005
Well, begging your pardon, miss.
It was not my place.

343
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,253
<font color="#4040f0">(Creaking, wind howling)</font>

344
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,758
Has my daughter given you
an answer yet?

345
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:23,691
No, she hasn't.

346
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,730
Well, she has had
a very trying day.

347
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:29,959
Ghastly weather,
don't you think?

348
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,797
Bleak. Very bleak.

349
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,461
<font color="#4040f0">(Thud in distance)</font>

350
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,630
What's that?

351
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:37,697
Cannon fire!

352
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,869
Return fire!

353
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,573
- I know those guns.
- Men to arms!

354
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,944
It's the Pearl.

355
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:53,080
The Black Pearl?

356
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,856
I've heard stories.

357
00:29:56,927 --> 00:30:00,693
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near 10 years.

358
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,289
Never leaves any survivors.

359
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:04,630
No survivors?

360
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,671
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

361
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,173
Coming through!

362
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:20,709
Aaah!

363
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,096
<font color="#40a040">Cdre. Norrington:</font> Sight the muzzle flash!

364
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,325
<font color="#40a040">Man:</font> Aim for the flashes!

365
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,264
I need a full strike,
fore and aft.

366
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,895
Mr. Stephens, more cartridges!

367
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,930
Governor, barricade yourself
in my office.

368
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,575
That's an order.

370
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,427
Don't!

371
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:15,260
Hello, chum.

372
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,795
Up there.

373
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:22,202
Up there!

374
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:33,274
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you!

375
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,044
What?

376
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,086
You're the governor's daughter.

377
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:37,620
<font color="#40a040">Man:</font> In here!

378
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,719
Listen.
They haven't seen you.

379
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:43,225
The first chance you get,
run to the fort.

380
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:53,258
Gotcha.

381
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:01,307
No! No! No!
It's hot!

382
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:02,470
You burned me!

383
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:03,774
Come on!

384
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,076
No!

00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,027
We know you're here, poppet.

387
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,187
Poppet.

388
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:56,528
Come out and we promise
we won't hurt you.

389
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,760
Eh?

390
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:02,564
We will find you, poppet.

391
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:07,975
You've got something of ours,
and it calls to us.

392
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,215
The gold calls to us.

393
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:18,652
Gold.

394
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,222
Hello, poppet.

395
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:28,287
Parley.

396
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:28,990
What?

397
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,226
Parley.

398
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,393
I invoke the right of parley.

399
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,731
According to the Code
of the Brethren

400
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:35,738
set down by the pirates Morgan
and Bartholomew,

401
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:37,239
you have to take me
to your captain.

402
00:34:37,307 --> 00:34:38,899
I know the Code.

403
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,534
If an adversary demands parley,

404
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,909
you can do them no harm
until the parley is complete.

405
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,277
To blazes with the Code.

406
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,317
She wants to be taken
to the captain.

407
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:51,350
And she'll go without a fuss.

408
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,448
We must honor the Code.

409
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:07,069
Say goodbye.

410
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,438
Goodbye.

411
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,579
- Will!
- Come on!

412
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,047
Elizabeth.

413
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,850
Out of my way, scum!

414
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:43,338
My sympathies, friend.

415
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,637

It's just you and me now.

419
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,133
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

Come on.
That's a boy.

421
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:17,166
Good boy.
Come get the bone.

422
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,833
That's a good boy.
Come on.

423
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:21,139
A bit closer.
A bit closer.

424
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,145
That's it.
That's it, doggy.

425
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:26,705

slimy, mangy cur.

<font color="#4040f0">(Door closes)</font>
Don't do that.

427
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:30,450
No, no!
I didn't mean it!

428
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,783
I didn't.

429
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:33,447
<font color="#4040f0">(Thud, men shouting)</font>

430
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,353
This ain't the armory.

431
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:45,664
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Twigg.

432
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,227
Captain Jack Sparrow.

433
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:51,133
<font color="#40a040">Twigg:</font> Last time I saw you,

434
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:55,804
you were all alone
on a godforsaken island,

435
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:58,040
shrinking into the distance.

436
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,640
His fortunes aren't
improved much.

437
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:04,084
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

438
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:07,248
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

439
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:09,258
and mutineers.

440
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,061
So there is a curse.

441
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:17,591
That's interesting.

442
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,432
You know nothing of hell.

443
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:30,978
That's very interesting.

445
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,615
I didn't know
we was taking on captives.

She's invoked the right
of parley with Captain Barbossa.

447
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:15,653
- I'm here to--
- You'll speak when spoken to.

448
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,194
And ye will not lay a hand

449
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,754
on those under the protection
of parley.

450
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,561
Aye, sir.

451
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,370
My apologies, miss.

452
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:31,969
Captain Barbossa,
I am here to negotiate

453
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:35,136
the cessation of hostilities
against Port Royal.

454
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,442
There were a lot
of long words in there.

455
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:40,608
We're naught but humble pirates.

456
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:42,311
What is it that you want?

457
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,616
I want you to leave
and never come back.

<font color="#4040f0">(Laughter)</font>

459
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,491
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

460
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:53,656
Means "no."

461
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,761
Very well.

462
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:00,702
I'll drop it.

463
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:06,902
Me holds are bursting with swag.

464
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,673
That bit of shine matters to us?

465
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:11,441
Why?

466
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:15,383
It's what you've been searching
for. I recognize this ship.

467
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:18,512
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England.

468
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:20,954
Did you, now?

469
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,490
Fine.

470
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:26,290
I suppose if it is worthless,

471
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,456
there's no point
in me keeping it.

472
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,644
You have a name, missy?

473
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:46,605
Elizabeth Turner.

474
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:50,017
I'm a maid
in the governor's household.

475
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:54,817
Miss Turner.

476
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,355
Bootstrap.

477
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:04,593
How does a maid own
a trinket such as that?

478
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:08,104
Family heirloom, perhaps?

479
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:11,106
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

480
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:12,539
Very well.
Hand it over.

481
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:16,636
We'll put your town to our
rudder and ne'er return.

482
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,421
Our bargain?

483
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,155
Still the guns and stow them.

484
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:40,359
Wait!
You have to take me to shore!

485
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,802
According to the Code--

486
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:46,468
First, your return to shore
was not part of our agreement.

487
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:47,805
So I must do nothing.

488
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,813
You must be a pirate for
the Pirate's Code to apply,

489
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:51,813
and you're not.

490
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,545
Thirdly, the Code is more
what you'd call guidelines

491
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,280
than actual rules.

492
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:01,120
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

493
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,145
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

494
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:27,342
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

495
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,942
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

496
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,545
And where do you propose
we start?

497
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,250
If you have information
concerning my daughter,

498
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:37,259
please share it.

499
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,926
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

500
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:45,593
Mentioned it
is more what he did.

501
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:49,528
Ask him where it is.
He could lead us to it.

502
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:53,064
No. The pirates
who invaded this fort

503
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,603
left Sparrow locked in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

504
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,582
We will establish
their most likely course.

505
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,550
That's not good enough!

506
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:06,453
Mr. Turner, you are not
a military man.

507
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,184
You are not a sailor.

508
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,557
You are a blacksmith.

509
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:14,290
And this is not the moment
for rash actions.

510
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,458
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

511
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:21,095
you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

512
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,409
<font color="#4040f0">(Door opens)</font>

513
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:34,814
You. Sparrow.

514
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,911
You are familiar with that ship.
The Black Pearl.

515
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:38,920
I've heard of it.

516
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,354
Where does it make berth?

517
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:42,516
Where does it make berth?

518
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:45,083
Have you not heard the stories?

519
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,466
Captain Barbossa
and his crew of miscreants

520
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:53,162
sail from the dreaded
Isla de Muerta.

521
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,828
It's an island
that cannot be found,

522
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,773
except by those
who already know where it is.

523
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,276
The ship's real enough.

524
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:03,278
Its anchorage
must be a real place.

525
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:04,745
Where is it?

526
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:06,873
Why ask me?

527
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,417
Because you're a pirate.

528
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,318
And you want to turn pirate
yourself, is that it?

529
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:13,411
Never.

530
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:18,321
They took Miss Swann.

531
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,761
Oh, so it is
that you found a girl.

532
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,958
I see. Well, if you're intending
to brave all,

533
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:28,266
hasten to her rescue,
and so win fair lady's heart,

534
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:30,602
you'll have to
do it alone, mate.

535
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,108
I see no profit in it for me.

536
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:34,643
I can get you out of here.

537
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:36,906
How's that?
They key's run off.

538
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,572
I helped build these cells.

539
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:40,878
These are
half-pin barrel hinges.

540
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:46,187
With the right leverage and the
proper application of strength.

541
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,716
The door will lift free.

542
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:52,418
What's your name?

543
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:54,725
Will Turner.

544
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,198
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

545
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,360
Good, strong name.

546
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,200
No doubt named for your father.

547
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,165
Yes.

548
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,834
Uh-huh.

549
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,209
Well, Mr. Turner,
I've changed me mind.

550
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,545
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear on pain of death

551
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,585
I shall take you
to the Black Pearl

552
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:17,745
and your bonny lass.

553
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,187
Do we have an accord?

554
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:23,652
Agreed.

555
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,659
Agreed.

556
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,355
Get me out.

557
00:44:29,432 --> 00:44:30,956
Hurry.
Someone will have heard that.

558
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,264
Not without my effects.

559
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:41,539
We're going to steal the ship?

560
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,142
That ship?

561
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,011
Commandeer.

562
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:48,346
We're going to commandeer
that ship.

563
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:50,352
Nautical term.

564
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,320
One question
about your business.

565
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,754
Or there's no use going.

566
00:44:53,823 --> 00:44:55,450
This girl.

567
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:58,187
How far are you willing
to go to save her?

568
00:44:58,261 --> 00:44:59,694
I'd die for her.

569
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,025
Oh, good.

570
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:02,894
No worries, then.

571
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:25,318
This is either madness
or brilliance.

572
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:30,052
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

573
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:02,390
Everyone stay calm!
We are taking over the ship.

574
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,450
Aye! Avast!

575
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:10,457
This ship cannot be crewed
by two men.

576
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:13,195
You'll never make it
out of the bay.

577
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:17,933
Son, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

578
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:19,565
Savvy?

579
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,137
Commodore.

580
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,115
<font color="#40a040">Lt. Gillette:</font> Sir,
they've taken the Dauntless!

581
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,314
Commodore!

582
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:32,877
They've taken the ship!

583
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,186
Sparrow and Turner
have taken the Dauntless!

584
00:46:35,258 --> 00:46:39,126
<font color="#40a040">Cdre. Norrington:</font> Rash, Turner. Too rash.

585
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:44,764
That is without doubt the worst
pirate I have ever seen.

586
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,761
Here they come.

587
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:56,776
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

588
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:06,253
Search every cabin, every hull,
down to the bilges.

589
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,302
Sailors,
back to the Interceptor.

590
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:24,431
Now!

591
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:34,381
Thank you, Commodore, for
getting us ready to make way.

592
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,749
We'd have had a hard time of it
by ourselves.

593
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:42,622
Set topsails
and clear up this mess.

594
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,626
With the wind,
we won't catch them.

595
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:47,492
I don't need to. Get them
in range of the long nines.

596
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,327
Hands, come about!

597
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,560
Run out the guns!

598
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:54,228
We are to fire
on our own ship, sir?

599
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,295
I'd rather see her
at the bottom of the ocean

600
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:58,363
than in the hands of a pirate.

601
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:03,470
Commodore, he's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

602
00:48:06,482 --> 00:48:08,507
Abandon ship!

603
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:18,419
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

604
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:21,088
So it would seem.

605
00:48:29,636 --> 00:48:31,661
<font color="#40a040">Will:</font> When I was a lad
living in England,

606
00:48:31,738 --> 00:48:33,672
my mother raised me by herself.

607
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,370
After she died, I came out here,
looking for my father.

608
00:48:38,979 --> 00:48:40,947
Is that so?

609
00:48:41,948 --> 00:48:44,883
My father, Will Turner.

610
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:47,943
It was only after you learnt
my name you agreed to help.

611
00:48:48,021 --> 00:48:50,387
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

612
00:48:50,457 --> 00:48:52,448
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

613
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:54,551
You knew my father.

614
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:01,829
I knew him.

615
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:05,065
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

616
00:49:05,138 --> 00:49:08,232
Everyone else called him
Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.

617
00:49:08,308 --> 00:49:10,139
Bootstrap?

618
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,770
Good man.
Good pirate.

619
00:49:12,846 --> 00:49:14,939
I swear, you look just like him.

620
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:16,039
It's not true.

621
00:49:16,116 --> 00:49:18,016
He was a merchant sailor.

622
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:20,245
A respectable man
who obeyed the law.

623
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,756
He was a bloody pirate.
A scallywag.

624
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:27,691
My father was not a pirate.

625
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:31,754
Put it away, son. It's not worth
you getting beat again.

626
00:49:31,831 --> 00:49:34,766
You ignored the rules
of engagement.

627
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:36,324
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

628
00:49:36,403 --> 00:49:39,429
Then that's not much incentive
for me to fight fair.

629
00:49:46,546 --> 00:49:49,879
Now, as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

630
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,817
The only rules
that really matter are these.

631
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:56,344
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

632
00:49:56,423 --> 00:49:57,788
For instance,

633
00:49:57,857 --> 00:50:01,349
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man

634
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:02,588
or you can't.

635
00:50:02,662 --> 00:50:04,095
Pirate is in your blood,

636
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:06,758
so you'll have to square
with that someday.

637
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:07,993
Now, me, for example.

638
00:50:08,068 --> 00:50:09,968
I can let you drown.

639
00:50:10,036 --> 00:50:12,266
But I can't bring this ship
into Tortuga

640
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:13,772
all by me onesy, savvy?

641
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,137
So.

642
00:50:20,013 --> 00:50:23,471
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

643
00:50:24,618 --> 00:50:26,518
Or can you not?

644
00:50:28,655 --> 00:50:30,555
Tortuga?

645
00:50:30,624 --> 00:50:32,023
Tortuga.

646
00:50:54,147 --> 00:50:56,672
More importantly,
it is indeed a sad life

647
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,719
that has never breathed deep
this sweet bouquet

648
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:01,947
that is Tortuga, savvy?

649
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:05,150
What do you think?

650
00:51:08,528 --> 00:51:09,586
It'll linger.

651
00:51:09,663 --> 00:51:11,358
I'll tell you, mate,

652
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:14,229
if every town in the world
were like this one,

653
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,667
no man would ever feel unwanted.

654
00:51:17,737 --> 00:51:19,227
Scarlett!

655
00:51:21,307 --> 00:51:23,236
Not sure I deserved that.

656
00:51:24,277 --> 00:51:25,602
Giselle!

657
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:26,611
Who was she?

658
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,544
What?

659
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,950
I may have deserved that.

660
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:36,479
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

661
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:40,925
Mother's love!

662
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:42,894
Jack!

663
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:46,193
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleeping.

664
00:51:46,266 --> 00:51:47,597
It's bad luck.

665
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:49,965
Fortunately,
I know how to counter it.

666
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:51,298
The man who did the waking

667
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:53,635
buys the man who was sleeping
a drink.

668
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:56,505
The man who was sleeping drinks
while listening to a proposition

669
00:51:56,576 --> 00:51:58,874
from the man who did the waking.

670
00:52:00,947 --> 00:52:03,609
Aye, that'll about do it.

671
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:09,984
Blast!
I'm already awake!

672
00:52:10,056 --> 00:52:12,024
That was for the smell.

673
00:52:21,868 --> 00:52:23,802
Keep a sharp eye.

674
00:52:30,543 --> 00:52:34,769
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of yourn?

675
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:38,110
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

676
00:52:41,955 --> 00:52:46,392
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

677
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:49,622
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

678
00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:53,029
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

679
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:56,193
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

680
00:52:56,269 --> 00:52:58,669
All I need is a crew.

681
00:52:58,738 --> 00:53:00,262
From what I hear of Barbossa,

682
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,173
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one.

683
00:53:03,243 --> 00:53:05,711
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool.

684
00:53:05,779 --> 00:53:07,371
Prove me wrong.

685
00:53:07,447 --> 00:53:10,939
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

686
00:53:11,017 --> 00:53:13,850
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage.

687
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,197
The kid?

688
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:37,166
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

689
00:53:37,243 --> 00:53:39,711
His only child, savvy?

690
00:53:39,779 --> 00:53:41,679
Is he, now?

691
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:47,017
"Leverage," says you.

692
00:53:47,086 --> 00:53:50,021
"I think I feel a change
in the wind," says I.

693
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:51,647
I'll find us a crew.

694
00:53:51,724 --> 00:53:54,488
There's bound to be some sailors
crazy as you.

695
00:53:54,561 --> 00:53:56,756
One can only hope.

696
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:57,922
Take what you can.

697
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,431
Give nothing back.

698
00:54:24,457 --> 00:54:26,357
You'll be dining
with the captain.

699
00:54:26,426 --> 00:54:29,554
And he requests you wear this.

700
00:54:29,629 --> 00:54:30,823
You tell the captain

701
00:54:30,897 --> 00:54:34,298
that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

702
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:36,733
He said you'd say that.

703
00:54:36,803 --> 00:54:39,271
He also said,
if that be the case,

704
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:41,170
you'll be dining with the crew.

705
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:43,709
And you'll be naked.

706
00:54:49,382 --> 00:54:50,474
Fine.

707
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,733
There's no need to stand on
ceremony, nor call to impress.

708
00:55:11,804 --> 00:55:13,863
You must be hungry.

709
00:55:30,556 --> 00:55:32,456
Try the wine.

710
00:55:36,763 --> 00:55:37,821
And the apples.

711
00:55:37,897 --> 00:55:40,127
One of those next?

712
00:55:47,907 --> 00:55:49,602
It's poisoned.

713
00:55:51,244 --> 00:55:53,439
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

714
00:55:53,513 --> 00:55:55,105
Release me.
You have your trinket.

715
00:55:55,181 --> 00:55:57,706
I'm of no further value to you.

716
00:56:00,987 --> 00:56:04,548
You don't know what this is,
do you?

717
00:56:04,624 --> 00:56:06,285
It's a pirate medallion.

718
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:09,795
This is Aztec gold.

719
00:56:09,862 --> 00:56:12,387
One of 882 identical pieces

720
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:17,164
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortes himself.

721
00:56:17,236 --> 00:56:19,363
Blood money paid
to stem the slaughter

722
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:22,067
he wreaked upon them
with his armies.

723
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:25,474
But the greed of Cortes
was insatiable.

724
00:56:25,545 --> 00:56:33,213
So the heathen gods placed
upon the gold a terrible curse.

725
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,712
Any mortal that removes

726
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:39,189
but a single piece
from that stone chest

727
00:56:39,258 --> 00:56:42,659
shall be punished for eternity.

728
00:56:44,163 --> 00:56:47,565
I hardly believe in ghost
stories anymore, Captain.

729
00:56:47,633 --> 00:56:49,533
Aye.

730
00:56:49,602 --> 00:56:53,197
That's exactly what I thought
when we were told the tale.

731
00:56:53,272 --> 00:56:56,036
Buried on an island of dead
what cannot be found,

732
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:58,805
except for those
who know where it is.

733
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:01,509
Find it, we did.

734
00:57:02,715 --> 00:57:04,478
There be the chest.

735
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,916
Inside be the gold.

736
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:09,386
And we took them all.

737
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:11,548
We spent them and traded them

738
00:57:11,624 --> 00:57:14,115
and frittered them away
on drink and food

739
00:57:14,193 --> 00:57:15,956
and pleasurable company.

740
00:57:16,029 --> 00:57:22,229
The more we gave them away,
the more we came to realize,

741
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:25,395
the drink would not satisfy,

742
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:28,998
food turned to ash
in our mouths,

743
00:57:29,075 --> 00:57:31,403
and all the pleasurable company
in the world

744
00:57:31,477 --> 00:57:33,968
could not slake our lust.

745
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:38,982
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

746
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:46,084
Compelled by greed, we were,
but now we are consumed by it.

747
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:47,820
<font color="#4040f0">(Screeches)</font>

748
00:57:57,236 --> 00:58:00,899
There is one way
we can end our curse.

749
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,273
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

750
00:58:07,346 --> 00:58:11,908
must be restored
and the blood repaid.

751
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,320
Thanks to ye,
we have the final piece.

752
00:58:19,592 --> 00:58:21,856
And the blood to be repaid?

753
00:58:21,928 --> 00:58:26,991
That's why there's no sense
to be killin' you yet.

754
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:30,528
Apple?

755
00:58:36,709 --> 00:58:37,767
Arr!

756
00:58:38,911 --> 00:58:40,538
No!

757
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:47,777
I'm curious.

758
00:58:47,854 --> 00:58:51,381
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

759
00:58:57,263 --> 00:58:59,788
Aah!

760
00:59:49,315 --> 00:59:50,111
Aaaah!

761
00:59:50,183 --> 00:59:52,344
<font color="#4040f0">(Screeches)</font>

762
00:59:55,188 --> 00:59:56,450
Look!

763
00:59:56,522 --> 01:00:00,083
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

764
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:03,229
We are not among the living,
and so we cannot die.

765
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:05,624
But neither are we dead.

766
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:10,258
For too long I've been parched
and unable to quench it.

767
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:15,196
Too long I've been starving
to death and haven't died.

768
01:00:15,274 --> 01:00:17,606
I feel nothing.

769
01:00:17,677 --> 01:00:21,443
Not the wind on my face
nor the spray of the sea

770
01:00:21,514 --> 01:00:25,109
nor the warmth
of a woman's flesh.

771
01:00:25,885 --> 01:00:29,651
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

772
01:00:29,722 --> 01:00:31,451
You're in one!

773
01:00:46,072 --> 01:00:47,767
<font color="#4040f0">(Laughs)</font>

774
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,774
<font color="#4040f0">(Laughter)</font>

775
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:52,208
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

776
01:00:52,278 --> 01:00:54,746
You heard the captain.
Back to work.

777
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,920
<font color="#40a040">Gibbs:</font> Feast your eyes, Captain.

778
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:05,549
All of them faithful hands
before the mast.

779
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,958
Every man worth his salt.

780
01:01:09,028 --> 01:01:11,019
And crazy to boot.

781
01:01:11,097 --> 01:01:14,555
So this is
your able-bodied crew?

782
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:22,266
- You, sailor!
- Cotton, sir.

783
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:26,038
Mr. Cotton, do you have
the courage to follow orders

784
01:01:26,112 --> 01:01:29,104
and stay true in the face
of danger and death?

785
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:32,446
Mr. Cotton!
Answer, man!

786
01:01:32,518 --> 01:01:35,146
He's a mute. Poor devil
had his tongue cut out.

787
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:37,485
He trained the parrot
to talk for him.

788
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:39,990
No one's yet figured how.

789
01:01:42,628 --> 01:01:45,461
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

790
01:01:45,531 --> 01:01:46,793
Same question.

791
01:01:46,866 --> 01:01:50,267
<font color="#4040f0">(Squawks)</font> Wind in the sails!
Wind in the sails!

792
01:01:50,736 --> 01:01:53,068
Mostly we figure
that means "yes."

793
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:54,333
Of course it does.

794
01:01:54,407 --> 01:01:56,272
Satisfied?

795
01:01:56,342 --> 01:01:58,503
Well, you've proved they're mad.

796
01:01:58,577 --> 01:02:01,068
<font color="#40a040">Woman:</font> And what's the benefit for us?

797
01:02:10,823 --> 01:02:12,654
Anamaria.

798
01:02:14,427 --> 01:02:16,224
I suppose
you didn't deserve that.

799
01:02:16,295 --> 01:02:18,229
No, that one I deserved.

800
01:02:18,297 --> 01:02:20,492
You stole my boat!

801
01:02:20,566 --> 01:02:23,228
Actually--

802
01:02:23,302 --> 01:02:26,100
Borrowed.
Borrowed without permission.

803
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:28,197
But with every intention
of bringing it back.

804
01:02:28,274 --> 01:02:29,764
But you didn't!

805
01:02:29,842 --> 01:02:32,709
You'll get another one.

806
01:02:32,778 --> 01:02:33,608
I will.

807
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:35,169
A better one.

808
01:02:35,247 --> 01:02:36,908
A better one!

809
01:02:36,982 --> 01:02:37,778
That one.

810
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:39,477
What one?

811
01:02:41,454 --> 01:02:43,217
That one?

812
01:02:46,025 --> 01:02:47,788
Aye, that one.

813
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,452
- What say you?
- Aye!

814
01:02:49,528 --> 01:02:50,927

816
01:02:52,865 --> 01:02:57,165
No, no, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

817
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:59,466
It'll be far worse
not to have her.

818
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:36,734
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find

819
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:38,743
with a compass
that doesn't work?

820
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:40,904
Aye, the compass
doesn't point North,

821
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,541
but we're not trying
to find North, are we?

822
01:03:54,427 --> 01:03:56,861
We should drop canvas, sir.

823
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:59,762
She can hold a bit longer.

824
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:04,796
What's in your head that's
put you in such a fine mood?

825
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,838
We're catching up.

826
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,852
Time to go, poppet.

827
01:04:23,923 --> 01:04:27,290
<font color="#40a040">Ragetti:</font> Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:27,638
Puts a chill in the bones

830
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:31,644
how many honest sailors have
been claimed by this passage.

831
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:48,659
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

832
01:05:48,729 --> 01:05:51,823
Not a lot's known about Jack
fore he showed up in Tortuga

833
01:05:51,898 --> 01:05:54,765
with a mind to go after the
treasure of the Isla de Muerta.

834
01:05:54,835 --> 01:05:56,097
That was before I'd met him.

835
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:59,161
Back when he was Captain
of the Black Pearl.

836
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:00,228
What?

837
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,371
He failed to mention that.

838
01:06:05,445 --> 01:06:07,675
He plays things
closer to the vest now.

839
01:06:07,748 --> 01:06:09,807
And a hard-learned lesson
it was.

840
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,351
Three days out,
the first mate comes to him

841
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:14,478
and says everything's
an equal share.

842
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:17,022
That should mean the location
of the treasure.

843
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,388
Jack gives up the bearings.

844
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:22,622
That night, there was a mutiny.

845
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:25,824
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die,

846
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,993
but not before he'd gone mad
with the heat.

847
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:34,773
So that's the reason
for all the...

848
01:06:36,877 --> 01:06:39,311
Reason's got nothing
to do with it.

849
01:06:39,379 --> 01:06:41,643
Now, Will,
when a pirate's marooned,

850
01:06:41,715 --> 01:06:44,775
he's a given a pistol with
a single shot. One shot.

851
01:06:44,851 --> 01:06:47,979
Well, that won't do much good
hunting or to be rescued.

852
01:06:48,054 --> 01:06:51,490
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

853
01:06:51,558 --> 01:06:54,652
that pistol will start
to look real friendly.

854
01:06:54,728 --> 01:06:58,323
But Jack escaped the island, and
he still has that single shot.

855
01:06:58,398 --> 01:07:01,834
Oh, he won't use it,
though, save on one man.

856
01:07:01,902 --> 01:07:04,029
His mutinous first mate.

857
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:06,436
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

858
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:09,003
How did Jack get off the island?

859
01:07:09,075 --> 01:07:10,599
Well, I'll tell ye.

860
01:07:10,677 --> 01:07:12,474
He waded out into the shallows.

861
01:07:12,546 --> 01:07:15,014
He waited there
three days and three nights

862
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:16,912
till all manner of sea creatures

863
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:19,747
'came acclimated
to his presence.

864
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,549
And on the fourth morning,

865
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:23,748
he roped
a couple of sea turtles,

866
01:07:23,824 --> 01:07:27,055
lashed them together,
and made a raft.

867
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:29,824
He roped a couple
of sea turtles?

868
01:07:29,896 --> 01:07:32,558
Aye, sea turtles.

869
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:36,034
What did he use for rope?

870
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:43,503
Human hair.

871
01:07:43,577 --> 01:07:45,374
From my back.

872
01:07:46,379 --> 01:07:47,539
Let go the anchor!

873
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:50,048
<font color="#40a040">Together:</font> Aye, Captain, aye!

874
01:07:50,116 --> 01:07:53,084
Young Mr. Turner and I
are to go ashore.

875
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:56,782
Captain, what if the worst
should happen?

876
01:07:56,857 --> 01:07:57,983
Keep to the Code.

877
01:07:58,058 --> 01:08:00,151
Aye, the Code.

878
01:08:25,285 --> 01:08:26,479
Move.

879
01:08:26,553 --> 01:08:28,851
10 years of hoarding swag.

880
01:08:28,922 --> 01:08:31,413
And now we finally
get to spend it.

881
01:08:37,931 --> 01:08:41,833
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men.

882
01:08:41,902 --> 01:08:45,599
You can buy an eye what actually
fits and is made of glass.

883
01:08:45,672 --> 01:08:48,641
This one does splinter
something terrible.

884
01:08:49,476 --> 01:08:51,637
Stop rubbing it.

885
01:09:10,597 --> 01:09:13,589
What Code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

886
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:15,794
Pirate's Code.

887
01:09:15,869 --> 01:09:20,499
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

888
01:09:21,174 --> 01:09:24,109
No heroes amongst thieves?

889
01:09:24,778 --> 01:09:27,246
For having such
a bleak outlook on pirates,

890
01:09:27,314 --> 01:09:30,181
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

891
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,185
Sprung a man from jail,

892
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,619
commandeered a ship
of the fleet,

893
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:39,022
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga.

894
01:09:40,727 --> 01:09:44,094
And you're completely
obsessed with treasure.

895
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:51,202
That's not true.
I am not obsessed with treasure.

896
01:09:57,677 --> 01:10:00,441
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

897
01:10:00,513 --> 01:10:03,311
<font color="#40a040">Capt. Barbossa:</font> Gentlemen, the time has come!

898
01:10:03,383 --> 01:10:06,375
Our salvation is nigh!

899
01:10:07,253 --> 01:10:09,312
Our torment is near an end.

900
01:10:09,389 --> 01:10:10,981
Elizabeth.

901
01:10:11,057 --> 01:10:13,651
For 10 years
we've been tested and tried,

902
01:10:13,727 --> 01:10:15,524
and each man jack of you here

903
01:10:15,595 --> 01:10:18,962
has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

904
01:10:19,032 --> 01:10:21,694
and a hundred times again!

905
01:10:23,203 --> 01:10:25,501
Suffered, I have!

906
01:10:25,572 --> 01:10:28,905
Punished, we were,
the lot of us.

907
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:33,071
Disproportionate to our crime!

908
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,248
Here it is!

909
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:42,814
The cursed treasure
of Cortes himself.

910
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:49,155
Every last piece that went
astray, we have returned.

911
01:10:49,229 --> 01:10:50,890
Save for this.

912
01:10:50,964 --> 01:10:52,397
Jack!

913
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:56,265
<font color="#40a040">Jack:</font> Not yet. We wait
for the opportune moment.

914
01:10:56,336 --> 01:11:00,500
881 we found, but despaired
of ever finding the last.

915
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:02,370
When's that?

916
01:11:02,442 --> 01:11:04,967
When it's
of greatest profit to you?

917
01:11:05,045 --> 01:11:07,775
May I ask you something?

918
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:11,476
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

919
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:12,882
Do us a favor.

920
01:11:12,952 --> 01:11:16,911
I know it's difficult for you,
but please stay here

921
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:19,982
and try not to do
anything stupid.

922
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:25,054
And who among us has paid
the blood sacrifice

923
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:26,655
owed to the heathen gods?

924
01:11:26,733 --> 01:11:27,392
<font color="#40a040">Together:</font> Us!

925
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:30,300
And whose blood
must yet be paid?

926
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,031
<font color="#40a040">Together:</font> Hers!

927
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,570
You know the first thing
I'm gonna do

928
01:11:36,643 --> 01:11:39,510
after the curse is lifted?

929
01:11:41,081 --> 01:11:44,608
Eat a whole bushel of apples.

930
01:11:47,454 --> 01:11:49,251
<font color="#4040f0">(Chanting)</font>

931
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,318
Begun by blood.

932
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:57,124
By blood undone.

933
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,497
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not gonna be your leverage.

934
01:12:13,813 --> 01:12:16,043
That's it?

935
01:12:16,116 --> 01:12:17,640
Waste not.

936
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,445
<font color="#4040f0">(Chanting stops)</font>

937
01:12:55,722 --> 01:12:56,950
Did it work?

938
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:00,624
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

939
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:09,662
You're not dead.

940
01:13:09,736 --> 01:13:11,203
No.

941
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:13,472
He shot me!

942
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,030
<font color="#40a040">Ragetti:</font> It didn't work.

943
01:13:15,108 --> 01:13:17,770
The curse it still upon us!

944
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:24,614
You, maid!
Your father, what was his name?

945
01:13:24,684 --> 01:13:27,482
Was your father William Turner?

946
01:13:27,554 --> 01:13:28,521
No.

947
01:13:28,588 --> 01:13:32,183
Where's his child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

948
01:13:32,258 --> 01:13:35,853
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

949
01:13:42,936 --> 01:13:44,961
You two!

950
01:13:45,038 --> 01:13:48,371
You brought us the wrong person!

951
01:13:48,441 --> 01:13:49,738
No!

952
01:13:49,809 --> 01:13:52,607
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

953
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:55,147
<font color="#40a040">Ragetti:</font> She said her name was Turner.

954
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,048
I think she lied to us.

955
01:14:01,254 --> 01:14:04,052
You brought us here for nothing.

956
01:14:04,123 --> 01:14:07,752
I won't take questioning or
second guesses from you, Twigg.

957
01:14:07,827 --> 01:14:09,055
Who's to blame?

958
01:14:09,128 --> 01:14:12,791
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse.

959
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,860
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

960
01:14:16,936 --> 01:14:19,029
<font color="#40a040">Together:</font> Yeah!

961
01:14:20,773 --> 01:14:24,072
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place.

962
01:14:25,144 --> 01:14:29,240
If any coward here dare
challenge me, let him speak!

963
01:14:30,016 --> 01:14:33,782
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood,

964
01:14:33,853 --> 01:14:34,717
just in case.

965
01:14:34,787 --> 01:14:36,277
<font color="#40a040">Men:</font> Yeah!

966
01:14:44,864 --> 01:14:46,092
The medallion!

967
01:14:46,165 --> 01:14:47,496
She's taken it!

968
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:52,004
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

969
01:14:56,009 --> 01:14:57,704
No oars here!

970
01:14:57,777 --> 01:15:00,143
Where's the oars?

971
01:15:00,213 --> 01:15:02,408
The oars have gone missing.

972
01:15:02,482 --> 01:15:04,177
Find them!

973
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:10,082
Find the oars!

974
01:15:12,525 --> 01:15:14,288
You.

975
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:17,292
You're supposed to be dead!

976
01:15:17,363 --> 01:15:19,160
Am I not?

977
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:31,304
Palulay.

978
01:15:31,377 --> 01:15:33,777
Palu-li-la-la-lulu.

979
01:15:36,215 --> 01:15:38,012
Parlili.

980
01:15:38,084 --> 01:15:43,147
Parsnip, parsley,
partner, partner.

981
01:15:43,222 --> 01:15:43,984
Parley?

982
01:15:44,057 --> 01:15:46,389
That's the one!
Parley!

983
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,619
Parley!

984
01:15:47,694 --> 01:15:50,060
Parley?

985
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:55,066
Damn to the depths whatever man
that thought up "parley"!

986
01:15:55,902 --> 01:15:57,767
That would be the French.

987
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:10,973
Not more pirates.

988
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:13,416
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

989
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,715
Mr. Gibbs?

990
01:16:15,788 --> 01:16:18,086
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

991
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:19,590
Jack?

992
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:22,219
Jack Sparrow?

993
01:16:22,295 --> 01:16:24,320
He fell behind.

994
01:16:31,137 --> 01:16:32,695
Keep to the Code.

995
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:35,370
Weigh anchor!

996
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:38,569
Hoist the sails!
Make quick!

997
01:16:44,584 --> 01:16:48,486
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

998
01:16:49,155 --> 01:16:52,556
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

999
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:55,788
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

1000
01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:59,821
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

1001
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:04,598
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

1002
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:07,696
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

1003
01:17:07,774 --> 01:17:10,106
<font color="#40a040">Men:</font> Aye.

1004
01:17:10,176 --> 01:17:11,302
Kill him.

1005
01:17:12,979 --> 01:17:15,948
The girl's blood
didn't work, did it?

1006
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:19,777
Hold your fire!

1007
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:28,856
You know whose blood we need.

1008
01:17:29,896 --> 01:17:32,660
I know whose blood you need.

1009
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:41,704
What sort of a man trades
a man's life for a ship?

1010
01:17:41,774 --> 01:17:42,934
Pirate.

1011
01:17:43,943 --> 01:17:46,969
Here. Let me.

1012
01:17:47,046 --> 01:17:48,707
Thank you.

1013
01:17:50,016 --> 01:17:53,383
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

1014
01:17:54,687 --> 01:17:55,449
Why?

1015
01:17:58,691 --> 01:18:00,090
I don't know.

1016
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:01,854
<font color="#4040f0">(Gasps)</font>

1017
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:04,863
I'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands.
I know they're rough.

1018
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:08,924
No.
I mean yes, they are, but...

1019
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:14,305
But don't stop.

1020
01:18:21,647 --> 01:18:23,308
Elizabeth.

1021
01:18:39,031 --> 01:18:40,760
It's yours.

1022
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:48,162
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

1023
01:18:48,241 --> 01:18:50,675
It was a gift from my father.

1024
01:18:50,743 --> 01:18:52,574
He sent it to me.

1025
01:18:56,949 --> 01:18:59,042
Why did you take it?

1026
01:19:01,053 --> 01:19:04,648
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

1027
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,356
That would have been awful.

1028
01:19:10,696 --> 01:19:13,290
It wasn't your blood
they needed.

1029
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:18,069
It was my father's blood.

1030
01:19:19,906 --> 01:19:21,533
My blood.

1031
01:19:27,446 --> 01:19:28,936
The blood of a pirate.

1032
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:31,609
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

1033
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,555
You expect to leave me
on some beach

1034
01:19:46,632 --> 01:19:49,863
with nothing but a name and
your word it's the one I need

1035
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:53,599
and watch you sail away
in my ship?

1036
01:19:53,673 --> 01:19:54,662
No.

1037
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:57,208
I expect to leave you
standing on some beach

1038
01:19:57,276 --> 01:19:59,039
with absolutely no name at all,

1039
01:19:59,111 --> 01:20:01,671
watching me sail away
on my ship,

1040
01:20:01,747 --> 01:20:04,147
and then I'll shout the name
back to you.

1041
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:05,548
Savvy?

1042
01:20:05,618 --> 01:20:08,280
That still leaves the problem
of me on some beach

1043
01:20:08,354 --> 01:20:10,686
with naught but a name
and your word

1044
01:20:10,756 --> 01:20:13,247
it's the one I need.

1045
01:20:13,326 --> 01:20:15,123
Of the two of us,

1046
01:20:15,194 --> 01:20:18,823
I'm the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

1047
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:22,891
Therefore, my word is the one
we'll be trusting.

1048
01:20:22,969 --> 01:20:27,406
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

1049
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:30,567
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

1050
01:20:30,643 --> 01:20:34,306
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

1051
01:20:35,348 --> 01:20:37,248
Funny old world, isn't it?

1052
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:43,010
Captain, we're coming up
on the Interceptor.

<font color="#4040f0">(Screeches)</font>

1054
01:20:56,135 --> 01:20:58,729
I'm having a thought here,
Barbossa.

1055
01:20:58,804 --> 01:21:00,738
What say we run up
a flag of truce,

1056
01:21:00,806 --> 01:21:02,637
I scurry over
to the Interceptor,

1057
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:06,474
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

1058
01:21:06,545 --> 01:21:10,540
Now, that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

1059
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:14,450
People are easy to search
when they're dead.

1060
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,317
Lock him in the brig.

1061
01:21:28,601 --> 01:21:30,626
Hands aloft to loose t'gallants!

1062
01:21:30,703 --> 01:21:33,900
With this wind, she'll carry
every sail we've got!

1063
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:34,997
What's happening?

1064
01:21:35,074 --> 01:21:38,475
The Black Pearl.
She's gaining on us.

1065
01:21:42,615 --> 01:21:44,515
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

1066
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,643
You can tell them that
after they've caught us.

1067
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,517
We're shallower on the draft?

1068
01:21:49,588 --> 01:21:50,418
Aye.

1069
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,424
Well, then can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

1070
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,256
We don't have to outrun them
long, just long enough.

1071
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,855
Lighten the ship, stem to stern!

1072
01:21:59,932 --> 01:22:03,663
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost.

1073
01:22:12,645 --> 01:22:14,545
Apparently, there's a leak.

1074
01:22:29,295 --> 01:22:32,662
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

1075
01:22:32,732 --> 01:22:35,633
And run out the sweeps.

1076
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,464
- Pull!
- Ho!

1077
01:23:02,762 --> 01:23:04,923
We're gonna need that.

1078
01:23:12,838 --> 01:23:14,396
It was a good plan.

1079
01:23:14,473 --> 01:23:15,997
Up till now.

1080
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,337
Gibbs!

1081
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,241
We have to make a stand.

1082
01:23:19,311 --> 01:23:21,245
We must fight!

1083
01:23:21,313 --> 01:23:22,473
Load the guns!

1084
01:23:22,548 --> 01:23:23,640
With what?

1085
01:23:23,716 --> 01:23:25,616
Anything. Everything!

1086
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:27,709
Anything we have left.

1087
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:31,022
Load the guns!

1088
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,751
Case shot and langrage!

1089
01:23:32,825 --> 01:23:35,191
Nails and crushed glass!

1090
01:23:37,029 --> 01:23:38,929
With a will!

1091
01:23:59,518 --> 01:24:02,248
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

1092
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:05,051
She'll rake us without
ever presenting a target.

1093
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:07,115
Lower the anchor
on the right side.

1094
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,887
On the starboard side!

1095
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,725
It has the element of surprise.

1096
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,322
You're daft, lady!
You both are!

1097
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,334
Daft like Jack!

1098
01:24:16,402 --> 01:24:18,632
Lower the starboard anchor!

1099
01:24:18,704 --> 01:24:22,663
Do it, you dogs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

1100
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,627
Let go!

1101
01:24:48,434 --> 01:24:50,698
They're clubhauling!

1102
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:53,033
Hard to port!
Rack the starboard oars.

1103
01:24:53,105 --> 01:24:55,335
Hard to port!

1104
01:25:06,285 --> 01:25:09,083
Keep us steady, man.

1105
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:15,585
Now!

1106
01:25:15,661 --> 01:25:16,685
Fire!

1107
01:25:16,762 --> 01:25:18,923
Fire all!

1108
01:25:27,473 --> 01:25:30,408
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

1109
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:18,481
We could use
a few more ideas, lass.

1110
01:26:18,557 --> 01:26:19,615
Your turn.

1111
01:26:19,692 --> 01:26:21,956
We need us a devil's dowry.

1112
01:26:22,027 --> 01:26:24,257
We'll give them her.

1113
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,560
She's not what they're after.

1114
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:29,765
The medallion.

1115
01:26:51,023 --> 01:26:54,459
Raise your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

1116
01:26:54,526 --> 01:26:57,256
Hands, grapnels, at the ready.

1117
01:26:57,329 --> 01:26:59,661
Prepare to board!

1118
01:27:33,465 --> 01:27:35,831
Blast all to carcasses, men!

1119
01:27:35,901 --> 01:27:38,096
Forward clear
to the powder magazine.

1120
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:43,301
And the rest of you,
bring me that medallion!

1121
01:27:51,316 --> 01:27:52,613
Help!

1122
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,676
Hey!

1123
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:13,231
Below!

1124
01:28:32,658 --> 01:28:34,489
Thanks very much.

1125
01:28:47,172 --> 01:28:48,639
Jack!

1126
01:28:49,508 --> 01:28:51,271
Bloody empty.

1127
01:28:55,147 --> 01:28:56,478
Aaah!

1128
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:58,277
<font color="#4040f0">(Monkey screeches)</font>

1129
01:29:06,992 --> 01:29:09,222
That's not very nice.

1130
01:29:13,732 --> 01:29:14,926
Where's the medallion?

1131
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,797
Wretch!

1132
01:29:17,736 --> 01:29:19,135
Ahh.

1133
01:29:19,204 --> 01:29:21,172
Where's dear William?

1134
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:23,908
Will!

1135
01:29:25,744 --> 01:29:26,836
Will!

1136
01:29:26,912 --> 01:29:28,345
Elizabeth!

1137
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,346
Monkey!

1138
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:40,955
I can't move it!

1139
01:29:41,026 --> 01:29:41,993
Come on!

1140
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,288
Will!

1141
01:29:43,362 --> 01:29:44,488
Elizabeth!

1142
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,868
Why, thank you, Jack.

1143
01:29:58,944 --> 01:30:00,571
You're welcome.

1144
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:04,343
Not you.
We named the monkey "Jack."

1145
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:08,819
Gents, our hope is restored!

1146
01:30:44,056 --> 01:30:47,389
Any of you so much as thinks
the word "parley,"

1147
01:30:47,459 --> 01:30:50,917
I'll have your guts for garters.

1148
01:30:57,903 --> 01:30:59,495
Will!

1149
01:30:59,571 --> 01:31:02,165
You've got to stop it!

1150
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:04,436
- Stop it!
- Welcome back, miss.

1151
01:31:04,509 --> 01:31:07,239
You took advantage
of our hospitality last time.

1152
01:31:07,312 --> 01:31:10,975
It holds fair now
you return the favor.

1153
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,882
<font color="#4040f0">(Screaming)</font>

1154
01:31:16,421 --> 01:31:17,649
Barbossa!

1155
01:31:19,691 --> 01:31:21,488
Will.

1156
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:25,590
She goes free.

1157
01:31:25,664 --> 01:31:27,996
What's in your head, boy?

1158
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:29,929
She goes free!

1159
01:31:30,002 --> 01:31:33,768
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

1160
01:31:33,839 --> 01:31:35,739
Don't do anything stupid.

1161
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:40,437
You can't.

1162
01:31:40,512 --> 01:31:42,170
I can.

1163
01:31:43,181 --> 01:31:44,773
Like that.

1164
01:31:45,784 --> 01:31:47,649
Who are you?

1165
01:31:47,719 --> 01:31:49,243
No one.
He's no one.

1166
01:31:49,321 --> 01:31:52,779
A distant cousin of
my aunt's nephew twice removed.

1167
01:31:52,858 --> 01:31:54,951
Lovely singing voice, though.
Eunuch.

1168
01:31:55,027 --> 01:31:56,654
My name is Will Turner.

1169
01:31:56,728 --> 01:31:59,458
My father was
Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1170
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:02,125
His blood runs in my veins.

1171
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,964
He's the spitting image
of old Bootstrap Bill

1172
01:32:05,037 --> 01:32:06,368
come back to haunt us.

1173
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:10,340
On my word, do as I say,
or I'll pull this trigger

1174
01:32:10,409 --> 01:32:13,606
and be lost
to Davy Jones' locker.

1175
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,977
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

1176
01:32:16,048 --> 01:32:17,174
Elizabeth goes free.

1177
01:32:17,249 --> 01:32:19,945
Yes, we know that one.
Anything else?

1178
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:26,315
And the crew.
The crew are not to be harmed.

1179
01:32:30,829 --> 01:32:32,456
Agreed.

1180
01:32:38,737 --> 01:32:40,227
Go on, poppet, go!

1181
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:41,863
Walk the plank!

1182
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:55,547
Barbossa, you lying bastard!
You swore she'd go free!

1183
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:58,384
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.

1184
01:32:58,457 --> 01:33:00,015
I agreed she'd go free,

1185
01:33:00,092 --> 01:33:03,960
but it was you who failed
to specify when or where.

1186
01:33:09,368 --> 01:33:13,065
Though does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it?

1187
01:33:13,138 --> 01:33:14,662
<font color="#40a040">Men:</font> Aye.

1188
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:18,107
So I'll be having that dress
back before you go.

1189
01:33:22,314 --> 01:33:23,508
I always liked you.

1190
01:33:23,582 --> 01:33:24,571
<font color="#4040f0">(Grunts)</font>

1191
01:33:27,652 --> 01:33:29,415
Goes with your black heart.

1192
01:33:30,922 --> 01:33:33,356
Ooh, it's still warm.

1193
01:33:35,961 --> 01:33:37,519
Off you go!

1194
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:39,961
Come on!

1195
01:33:43,135 --> 01:33:44,659
Too long!

1196
01:33:55,447 --> 01:33:58,416
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1197
01:33:59,351 --> 01:34:00,784
Jack...

1198
01:34:00,852 --> 01:34:02,717
Jack.

1199
01:34:03,789 --> 01:34:05,256
Did you not notice?

1200
01:34:05,323 --> 01:34:08,087
That be the same island
we made you governor of

1201
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,287
on our last little trip.

1202
01:34:11,296 --> 01:34:12,558
I did notice.

1203
01:34:12,631 --> 01:34:14,064
Perhaps you'll be
able to conjure up

1204
01:34:14,132 --> 01:34:16,760
another miraculous escape.

1205
01:34:16,835 --> 01:34:18,564
But I doubt it.

1206
01:34:21,306 --> 01:34:22,864
Off you go.

1207
01:34:22,941 --> 01:34:23,805
<font color="#40a040">Men:</font> Yeah.

1208
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:26,469
Last time, you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1209
01:34:26,545 --> 01:34:28,570
By the powers, you're right.

1210
01:34:28,647 --> 01:34:32,139
Where be Jack's pistol?
Bring it forward.

1211
01:34:35,287 --> 01:34:38,688
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman would give us

1212
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:40,019
a pair of pistols.

1213
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:41,787
It'll be one pistol as before,

1214
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:44,294
You can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady

1215
01:34:44,362 --> 01:34:47,297
and starve to death yourself.

1216
01:35:10,664 --> 01:35:11,756
That's the second time

1217
01:35:11,832 --> 01:35:15,290
I've had to watch that man
sail away with my ship.

1218
01:35:17,037 --> 01:35:19,631
But you were marooned
on this island before.

1219
01:35:19,706 --> 01:35:21,298
We can escape
the same way you did.

1220
01:35:21,374 --> 01:35:24,241
To what point and purpose,
young missy?

1221
01:35:24,311 --> 01:35:26,211
The Black Pearl is gone.

1222
01:35:26,279 --> 01:35:29,840
Unless you have a rudder and
sails hidden in that bodice.

1223
01:35:29,916 --> 01:35:32,111
Unlikely.

1224
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:35,712
Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1225
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:40,015
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

1226
01:35:40,093 --> 01:35:43,995
You vanished from seven agents
of the East India Company.

1227
01:35:44,064 --> 01:35:47,090
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot.

1228
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:50,227
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

1229
01:35:52,105 --> 01:35:54,073
How did you escape last time?

1230
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:05,217
Last time, I was here a grand
total of three days, all right?

1231
01:36:06,419 --> 01:36:07,943
Last time...

1232
01:36:09,456 --> 01:36:12,425
The rumrunners
used this island as a cache,

1233
01:36:12,492 --> 01:36:15,461
came by, and I was able to
barter passage off.

1234
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:16,860
From the looks of things,

1235
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:19,262
they've long been out
of business.

1236
01:36:19,332 --> 01:36:23,826
Probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1237
01:36:24,437 --> 01:36:27,201
So that's it, then?

1238
01:36:27,274 --> 01:36:29,333
That's the secret
grand adventure

1239
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:31,934
of the infamous Jack Sparrow?

1240
01:36:32,012 --> 01:36:37,006
You spent three days lying
on a beach, drinking rum?

1241
01:36:39,186 --> 01:36:41,552
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1242
01:36:50,497 --> 01:36:52,089
<font color="#40a040">Both:</font> ♫  We're devils, we're black sheep  ♫

1243
01:36:52,165 --> 01:36:53,689
♫  We're really bad eggs  ♫

1244
01:36:53,767 --> 01:36:56,031
♫  Drink up, me hearties, yo ho  ♫

1245
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:57,967
♫  Yo ho, yo ho  ♫

1246
01:36:58,038 --> 01:36:58,970
Ouch!

1247
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:00,404
♫  A pirate's life for me  ♫

1248
01:37:00,473 --> 01:37:02,464
I love this song!

1249
01:37:05,478 --> 01:37:08,504
Really bad eggs!

1250
01:37:08,582 --> 01:37:09,571
Ooh.

1251
01:37:12,519 --> 01:37:14,384
When I get the Pearl back,

1252
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:17,116
I'm gonna teach it
to the whole crew.

1253
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:18,748
We'll sing it all the time.

1254
01:37:18,825 --> 01:37:22,693
You'll be the most fearsome
pirate in the Spanish Main.

1255
01:37:22,762 --> 01:37:25,560
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1256
01:37:25,632 --> 01:37:27,190
The entire ocean.

1257
01:37:27,267 --> 01:37:29,929
The entire world.

1258
01:37:30,003 --> 01:37:33,598
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is, you know.

1259
01:37:33,673 --> 01:37:36,506
It's not just a keel
and a deck and sails.

1260
01:37:36,576 --> 01:37:38,066
That's what a ship needs.

1261
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:45,846
But what a ship is,
what the Black Pearl really is,

1262
01:37:45,919 --> 01:37:47,682
is freedom.

1263
01:37:50,023 --> 01:37:54,153
Jack, it must be
really terrible for you

1264
01:37:54,227 --> 01:37:56,695
to be trapped on this island.

1265
01:37:56,763 --> 01:37:58,094
Oh, yes.

1266
01:37:58,164 --> 01:38:02,533
But the company is infinitely
better than last time,

1267
01:38:02,602 --> 01:38:03,830
I think.

1268
01:38:05,538 --> 01:38:07,768
The scenery
has definitely improved.

1269
01:38:07,841 --> 01:38:09,331
- Mr. Sparrow.
- Mm-hmm?

1270
01:38:09,409 --> 01:38:11,934
I'm not entirely sure
I've had enough rum

1271
01:38:12,012 --> 01:38:14,173
to allow that kind of talk.

1272
01:38:15,115 --> 01:38:17,709
I know exactly
what you mean, love.

1273
01:38:24,391 --> 01:38:25,949
To freedom.

1274
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:30,654
To the Black Pearl.

1275
01:38:59,959 --> 01:39:02,325
No! Not good!

1276
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,989
Stop! Not good!

1277
01:39:05,065 --> 01:39:06,191
What are you doing?

1278
01:39:06,266 --> 01:39:08,860
You burned all the food,
the shade! The rum!

1279
01:39:08,935 --> 01:39:10,596
Yes, the rum is gone.

1280
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:12,399
Why is the rum gone?

1281
01:39:12,472 --> 01:39:14,235
One, because it is a vile drink

1282
01:39:14,307 --> 01:39:17,140
that turns even the most
respectable men into scoundrels.

1283
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:20,304
Two, that signal is over
a thousand feet high.

1284
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,610
The entire Royal Navy
is looking for me.

1285
01:39:22,682 --> 01:39:26,311
Do you think there is the
slightest chance they won't see?

1286
01:39:26,386 --> 01:39:28,217
But why is the rum gone?

1287
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:31,214
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1288
01:39:31,291 --> 01:39:34,055
You give it one hour, maybe two,
and you will see

1289
01:39:34,127 --> 01:39:36,527
white sails on that horizon.

1290
01:39:43,370 --> 01:39:47,272
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

1291
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:49,740
Well, it bloody is now!

1292
01:39:56,649 --> 01:39:59,243
There'll be no living
with her after this.

1293
01:39:59,953 --> 01:40:01,921
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

1294
01:40:01,988 --> 01:40:03,749
You're safe now.

1295
01:40:03,823 --> 01:40:05,518
We will return to Port Royal,

1296
01:40:05,592 --> 01:40:07,560
not go gallivanting
after pirates!

1297
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:09,595
Then we condemn him to death.

1298
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:13,595
The boy's fate is regrettable,

1299
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:16,191
but so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1300
01:40:16,269 --> 01:40:19,966
To rescue me. To prevent
anything from happening to me.

1301
01:40:20,039 --> 01:40:23,531
If I may be so bold as to inject
my professional opinion.

1302
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:26,602
The Pearl was listing near
to scuppers after the battle.

1303
01:40:26,679 --> 01:40:29,614
It's very unlikely she'll
be able to make good time.

1304
01:40:29,682 --> 01:40:31,513
Think about it.

1305
01:40:31,584 --> 01:40:33,518
The Black Pearl.

1306
01:40:33,586 --> 01:40:37,852
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1307
01:40:37,924 --> 01:40:40,392
How can you pass that up, right?

1308
01:40:42,028 --> 01:40:44,826
By remembering that I serve
others, Mr. Sparrow.

1309
01:40:44,898 --> 01:40:46,229
Not only myself.

1310
01:40:46,299 --> 01:40:48,529
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this.

1311
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:50,034
For me.

1312
01:40:50,103 --> 01:40:52,401
As a wedding gift.

1313
01:40:52,472 --> 01:40:54,599
Elizabeth.

1314
01:40:54,674 --> 01:40:57,939
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1315
01:40:59,979 --> 01:41:01,173
I am.

1316
01:41:01,247 --> 01:41:03,078
A wedding!
I love weddings!

1317
01:41:03,149 --> 01:41:05,049
Drinks all around!

1318
01:41:07,287 --> 01:41:08,413
I know.

1319
01:41:08,488 --> 01:41:10,820
"Clap him in irons," right?

1320
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:16,857
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1321
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:20,093
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

1322
01:41:20,166 --> 01:41:21,758
You will spend the rest
of the voyage

1323
01:41:21,835 --> 01:41:24,269
contemplating all meanings
of the phrase

1324
01:41:24,337 --> 01:41:26,532
"silent as the grave."

1325
01:41:26,606 --> 01:41:28,164
Do I make myself clear?

1326
01:41:28,241 --> 01:41:30,835
Inescapably clear.

1327
01:41:34,347 --> 01:41:37,544
<font color="#4040f0">(Squawks)</font>
Shiver me timbers.

1328
01:41:37,617 --> 01:41:39,676
Cotton here says
you missed a bit.

1329
01:41:44,057 --> 01:41:46,082
You knew William Turner?

1330
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,651
Ol' Bootstrap Bill.

1331
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:51,526
We knew him.

1332
01:41:51,598 --> 01:41:55,557
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow.

1333
01:41:55,635 --> 01:41:58,160
The mutiny and all.

1334
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:01,071
He said it wasn't right
with the Code.

1335
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:05,099
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you.

1336
01:42:05,912 --> 01:42:09,575
He said we deserved
to be cursed.

1337
01:42:09,649 --> 01:42:11,708
And remain cursed.

1338
01:42:11,784 --> 01:42:12,808
Stupid blighter.

1339
01:42:12,886 --> 01:42:14,717
Good man.

1340
01:42:15,288 --> 01:42:17,381
Well, as you can imagine,

1341
01:42:17,457 --> 01:42:20,290
that didn't sit too well
with the captain.

1342
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:23,591
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all.

1343
01:42:23,663 --> 01:42:27,793
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1344
01:42:29,636 --> 01:42:33,504
So, what the captain did.

1345
01:42:33,573 --> 01:42:36,303
He strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1346
01:42:36,376 --> 01:42:37,866
Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1347
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:41,004
And last we saw
of Ol' Bill Turner,

1348
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,514
he was sinking to
the crushing, black oblivion

1349
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:46,450
of Davy Jones' locker.

1350
01:42:47,387 --> 01:42:49,082
'Course it was only after that

1351
01:42:49,155 --> 01:42:52,090
we learned we needed his blood
to lift the curse.

1352
01:42:52,158 --> 01:42:54,558
That's what you call ironic.

1353
01:42:59,465 --> 01:43:00,762
Bring him.

1354
01:43:07,391 --> 01:43:09,518
I don't care for the situation.

1355
01:43:09,593 --> 01:43:13,154
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn to an ambush.

1356
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:16,563
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1357
01:43:16,633 --> 01:43:20,763
I convince Barbossa to send his
men out with their little boats.

1358
01:43:20,837 --> 01:43:23,067
You and your mates return
to the Dauntless

1359
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:26,507
and blast the bejesus out of
them with your little cannons.

1360
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:28,806
What do you have to lose?

1361
01:43:28,879 --> 01:43:32,144
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1362
01:43:32,983 --> 01:43:35,611
Now, to be quite honest
with you,

1363
01:43:35,686 --> 01:43:37,620
there's a risk to those
aboard the Dauntless,

1364
01:43:37,688 --> 01:43:41,180
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

1365
01:43:41,258 --> 01:43:43,419
Sorry, but it's
for your own safety.

1366
01:43:43,493 --> 01:43:45,859
The commodore ordered!
I have to tell him!

1367
01:43:45,929 --> 01:43:47,157
The pirates!

1368
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:49,130
They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

1369
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:51,360
Don't worry.
He's informed of that.

1370
01:43:51,435 --> 01:43:55,599
A mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story.

1371
01:43:55,672 --> 01:43:58,402
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1372
01:44:09,086 --> 01:44:10,451
No reason to fret.

1373
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,489
Just a prick of the finger.
A few drops of blood.

1374
01:44:13,557 --> 01:44:15,184
No mistakes this time.

1375
01:44:15,258 --> 01:44:19,251
He's only half Turner.
We spill it all!

1376
01:44:21,064 --> 01:44:22,929
Guess there is reason to fret.

1377
01:44:36,813 --> 01:44:38,872
Beg your pardon.
Beg your pardon.

1378
01:44:38,949 --> 01:44:40,780
- Begun by blood.
- Excuse me.

1379
01:44:40,851 --> 01:44:43,615
By blood--

1380
01:44:46,256 --> 01:44:47,689
Jack!

1381
01:44:47,958 --> 01:44:49,084
It's not possible.

1382
01:44:49,159 --> 01:44:51,286
Not probable.

1383
01:44:51,895 --> 01:44:54,363
Where's Elizabeth?

1384
01:44:54,431 --> 01:44:56,922
She's safe,
just like I promised.

1385
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,764
She's set to marry Norrington,
like she promised.

1386
01:44:59,836 --> 01:45:02,168
You get to die for her,
like you promised.

1387
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:04,901
So we're all
men of our word, really.

1388
01:45:04,975 --> 01:45:07,773
Except for Elizabeth who is,
in fact, a woman.

1389
01:45:07,844 --> 01:45:10,278
Shut up!
You're next.

1390
01:45:12,282 --> 01:45:15,479
You don't want to
be doing that, mate.

1391
01:45:15,552 --> 01:45:18,282
No, I really think I do.

1392
01:45:19,289 --> 01:45:21,314
Your funeral.

1393
01:45:24,528 --> 01:45:26,996
Why don't I want to be doing it?

1394
01:45:27,063 --> 01:45:28,894
Well, because...

1395
01:45:28,965 --> 01:45:34,062
Because the HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1396
01:45:34,137 --> 01:45:39,302
is floating just offshore,
waiting for you.

1397
01:45:47,317 --> 01:45:48,716
What we doing here?

1398
01:45:50,253 --> 01:45:54,280
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1399
01:45:54,357 --> 01:45:59,954
We catch them in a crossfire,
send them down to see Old Hob.

1400
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:01,725
I know why we're here.

1401
01:46:01,798 --> 01:46:03,459
I meant, why aren't we doing

1402
01:46:03,533 --> 01:46:07,401
what Mr. Sparrow said we should
do with the cannons and all?

1403
01:46:07,471 --> 01:46:11,100
Because it was
Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1404
01:46:13,743 --> 01:46:16,268
You think he wasn't
telling the truth?

1405
01:46:16,346 --> 01:46:18,541
Just hear me out, mate.

1406
01:46:18,615 --> 01:46:20,776
You order your men
to row to the Dauntless.

1407
01:46:20,851 --> 01:46:22,978
They do what they do best.

1408
01:46:23,053 --> 01:46:25,044
Robert's your uncle.
Fannie's your aunt.

1409
01:46:25,121 --> 01:46:27,817
There you are with two ships.

1410
01:46:27,891 --> 01:46:30,086
The makings of
your very own fleet.

1411
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:33,755
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship, and who's to argue?

1412
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:35,798
But what of the Pearl?

1413
01:46:36,933 --> 01:46:38,696
Name me captain.

1414
01:46:38,768 --> 01:46:41,703
I'll sail under your colors.
I'll give you 10% of me plunder.

1415
01:46:41,771 --> 01:46:47,539
And you get to introduce
yourself as Commodore Barbossa.

1416
01:46:47,611 --> 01:46:48,543
Savvy?

1417
01:46:48,612 --> 01:46:52,241
I suppose in exchange, you
want me not to kill the whelp.

1418
01:46:52,315 --> 01:46:55,409
No, no, no. Not at all.
By all means, kill the whelp.

1419
01:46:55,485 --> 01:46:57,783
Just not yet.

1420
01:46:57,854 --> 01:47:03,520
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1421
01:47:05,695 --> 01:47:08,255
For instance...

1422
01:47:09,566 --> 01:47:13,002
After you've killed
Norrington's men.

1423
01:47:13,069 --> 01:47:17,938
Every last one.

1424
01:47:27,584 --> 01:47:30,109
You've been planning this
from the beginning.

1425
01:47:30,186 --> 01:47:32,177
Ever since you learned my name.

1426
01:47:32,255 --> 01:47:33,347
Yeah.

1427
01:47:35,659 --> 01:47:37,422
I want 50% of your plunder.

1428
01:47:37,494 --> 01:47:38,927
- 15%.
- 40%.

1429
01:47:38,995 --> 01:47:41,020
25%.

1430
01:47:41,097 --> 01:47:42,428
I'll buy you the hat.

1431
01:47:42,499 --> 01:47:46,435
A really big one, Commodore.

1432
01:47:49,272 --> 01:47:52,139
We have an accord.

1433
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:54,768
All hands to the boats!

1434
01:47:55,745 --> 01:47:56,871
Apologies.

1435
01:47:56,947 --> 01:47:58,642
You give the orders.

1436
01:47:59,816 --> 01:48:03,980
Gents, take a walk.

1437
01:48:08,558 --> 01:48:10,458
Not to the boats?

1438
01:49:08,652 --> 01:49:10,643
Hold fire.

1439
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:17,888
Oh, this is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy.

1440
01:49:17,961 --> 01:49:21,795
Except they was in a horse
instead of dresses.

1441
01:49:21,865 --> 01:49:23,264
Wooden horse.

1442
01:49:36,112 --> 01:49:37,773
A moment, please.

1443
01:49:41,351 --> 01:49:42,750
Elizabeth?

1444
01:49:45,588 --> 01:49:48,352
I just want you to know

1445
01:49:48,425 --> 01:49:51,417
I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1446
01:49:51,494 --> 01:49:53,621
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1447
01:49:54,631 --> 01:49:56,826
But, you know,
even a good decision,

1448
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:00,859
if made for the wrong reasons,
can be a wrong decision.

1449
01:50:07,377 --> 01:50:09,038
Look into that.
Report back.

1450
01:50:09,112 --> 01:50:10,340
Lieutenant?

1451
01:50:17,053 --> 01:50:19,521
Yoo-hoo!

1452
01:50:29,332 --> 01:50:30,731
Elizabeth?

1453
01:50:32,569 --> 01:50:34,059
Are you there?

1454
01:50:36,139 --> 01:50:38,767
Elizabeth, are you
even listening to me?

1455
01:51:05,034 --> 01:51:07,969
Oh, what have you done?

1456
01:51:08,037 --> 01:51:09,732
- Oooh!
- Stop that!

1457
01:51:09,806 --> 01:51:12,434
Already feel like a fool.

1458
01:51:12,509 --> 01:51:14,238
Look nice, though.

1459
01:51:18,381 --> 01:51:20,611
I look nice?

1460
01:51:56,753 --> 01:52:00,120
I must admit, Jack,
I thought I had you figured.

1461
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:03,250
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1462
01:52:03,326 --> 01:52:05,260
Me?
I'm dishonest.

1463
01:52:05,328 --> 01:52:08,559
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1464
01:52:08,631 --> 01:52:09,825
Honestly.

1465
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:12,367
It's the honest ones
you want to watch for,

1466
01:52:12,435 --> 01:52:14,733
because you can never predict

1467
01:52:14,804 --> 01:52:18,968
when they're going to do
something incredibly stupid.

1468
01:52:45,034 --> 01:52:46,331
Aaah!

1469
01:52:52,108 --> 01:52:54,474
You're off the edge
of the map, mate.

1470
01:52:54,544 --> 01:52:57,513
Here there be monsters.

1471
01:53:01,417 --> 01:53:04,280
Right!

1472
01:53:04,354 --> 01:53:06,322
What would you pick
to eat first?

1473
01:53:06,389 --> 01:53:08,448
I think we should decide now.

1474
01:53:08,524 --> 01:53:11,493
Just so we're ready
when the time comes.

1475
01:53:28,344 --> 01:53:29,811
<font color="#4040f0">(Screeches)</font>

1476
01:53:35,919 --> 01:53:37,614
<font color="#40a040">Both:</font> What was that?

1477
01:53:41,524 --> 01:53:42,513
<font color="#4040f0">(Gasps)</font>

1478
01:53:55,838 --> 01:53:56,930
Shh!

1479
01:53:59,943 --> 01:54:01,638
Miss Elizabeth!

1480
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:23,931
Make for the ship!
Move!

1481
01:54:32,642 --> 01:54:34,439
To the ship!

1482
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:39,214
Row, men!

1483
01:55:16,686 --> 01:55:19,484
You can't beat me, Jack.

1484
01:55:23,793 --> 01:55:24,782
<font color="#4040f0">(Sighs)</font>

1485
01:55:42,845 --> 01:55:45,075
That's interesting.

1486
01:55:55,191 --> 01:55:57,159
I couldn't resist, mate.

1487
01:56:45,374 --> 01:56:47,171
Aaah!

1488
01:57:03,559 --> 01:57:04,719
Sorry!

1489
01:57:13,803 --> 01:57:15,327
So what now, Jack Sparrow?

1490
01:57:15,404 --> 01:57:18,168
Are we to be two immortals
locked in an epic battle

1491
01:57:18,241 --> 01:57:21,699
until judgment day
and trumpets sound?

1492
01:57:21,777 --> 01:57:23,869
Or you could surrender.

1493
01:57:32,021 --> 01:57:34,922
Aaaah!

1494
01:57:50,273 --> 01:57:51,638
All of you with me!

1495
01:57:51,707 --> 01:57:53,766
Will is in that cave.
We must save him.

1496
01:57:53,843 --> 01:57:57,074
Ready.
And heave!

1497
01:58:02,585 --> 01:58:05,110
Please, I need your help!
Come on!

1498
01:58:05,188 --> 01:58:07,679
<font color="#4040f0">(Squawks)</font>
Any port in a storm.

1499
01:58:07,757 --> 01:58:10,282
Cotton's right.
We've got the Pearl.

1500
01:58:10,359 --> 01:58:12,418
What about Jack?
Are you gonna leave him?

1501
01:58:12,495 --> 01:58:14,326
Jack owes us a ship.

1502
01:58:14,397 --> 01:58:16,422
There's the Code to consider.

1503
01:58:16,499 --> 01:58:17,830
The Code?

1504
01:58:19,368 --> 01:58:20,801
You're pirates.

1505
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:23,566
Hang the Code,
and hang the rules!

1506
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:26,802
They're more like
guidelines anyway.

1507
01:58:29,412 --> 01:58:32,006
Bloody pirates!

1508
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:43,424
- Hey.
- What?

1509
01:58:43,492 --> 01:58:45,460
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1510
01:58:45,528 --> 01:58:48,361
They're stealing our ship!

1511
01:58:48,431 --> 01:58:50,763
Bloody pirates!

1512
01:58:52,101 --> 01:58:54,661
Boarders, away!

1513
01:59:02,211 --> 01:59:04,441
Come on!

1514
01:59:04,513 --> 01:59:05,912
Gaaah!

1515
01:59:30,106 --> 01:59:31,266
Me eye!

1516
01:59:41,651 --> 01:59:43,551
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

1517
01:59:51,327 --> 01:59:53,454
I'm gonna teach you
the meaning of pain!

1518
01:59:53,529 --> 01:59:55,087
Do you like pain?

1519
01:59:56,799 --> 01:59:59,029
Try wearing a corset.

1520
02:00:08,678 --> 02:00:10,976
Whose side is Jack on?

1521
02:00:11,047 --> 02:00:12,514
At the moment?

1522
02:00:26,929 --> 02:00:28,897
Aaaaaah!

1523
02:00:48,351 --> 02:00:49,477
No fair.

<font color="#4040f0">(Gunshot)</font>

1525
02:01:13,175 --> 02:01:18,670
Ten years you carry that pistol,
and now you waste your shot.

1526
02:01:18,748 --> 02:01:20,579
He didn't waste it.

1527
02:01:46,409 --> 02:01:48,206
I feel...

1528
02:01:52,448 --> 02:01:53,915
Cold.

1529
02:02:56,011 --> 02:02:57,535
Parley?

1530
02:02:58,581 --> 02:03:00,515
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1531
02:03:00,583 --> 02:03:01,914
<font color="#40a040">Together:</font> Huzzah!

<font color="#4040f0">(Glass shatters)</font>

1534
02:03:48,731 --> 02:03:51,063
We should return
to the Dauntless.

1535
02:03:53,569 --> 02:03:56,663
Your fiance will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1536
02:04:06,916 --> 02:04:09,908
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1537
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,510
That was it.

1538
02:04:14,089 --> 02:04:15,215
If you'd be so kind,

1539
02:04:15,291 --> 02:04:18,522
I'd be much obliged if you'd
drop me off at my ship.

1540
02:04:23,566 --> 02:04:25,830
I'm sorry, Jack.

1541
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:32,571
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1542
02:04:47,389 --> 02:04:50,449
"Jack Sparrow,
be it known that you..."

1543
02:04:50,526 --> 02:04:52,960
Captain.
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1544
02:04:53,028 --> 02:04:57,624
"For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown."

1545
02:04:57,933 --> 02:05:00,561
"Said crimes being numerous
in quantity

1546
02:05:00,636 --> 02:05:03,002
and sinister in nature.

1547
02:05:03,072 --> 02:05:06,803
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith.

1548
02:05:06,875 --> 02:05:09,366
Piracy, smuggling..."

1549
02:05:09,445 --> 02:05:11,743
This is wrong.

1550
02:05:11,814 --> 02:05:14,578
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law.

1551
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:17,175
As are we all.

1552
02:05:17,252 --> 02:05:19,914

Ah, yeah.

I love you.

02:06:30,025 --> 02:06:31,083
Move!

1571
02:06:42,905 --> 02:06:44,167
What...

1572
02:06:55,484 --> 02:06:57,076
Move!

1573
02:07:16,071 --> 02:07:17,504
Come on!

1574
02:07:17,573 --> 02:07:19,700
- Right!
- Come on, lads!

1575
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:49,669
I thought we might endure some
ill-conceived escape attempt.

1576
02:07:49,738 --> 02:07:51,205
But not from you.

1577
02:07:51,273 --> 02:07:55,073
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1578

And this is how you thank me?

1579
02:07:56,879 --> 02:07:59,575
By throwing in
your lot with him?

1580
02:07:59,648 --> 02:08:00,580
He's a pirate!

1581
02:08:00,649 --> 02:08:02,640
And a good man.

1582
02:08:03,952 --> 02:08:05,852
If all I have achieved
is the hangman

1583
02:08:05,921 --> 02:08:09,584
will earn two pairs of boots
instead of one, so be it.

1584
02:08:09,658 --> 02:08:11,421
My conscience will be clear.

1585
02:08:11,493 --> 02:08:15,259
You forget your place, Turner.

1586
02:08:16,165 --> 02:08:19,896
It's right here
between you and Jack.

1587
02:08:23,939 --> 02:08:24,928
As is mine.

1588
02:08:25,007 --> 02:08:26,338
Elizabeth!

1589
02:08:27,709 --> 02:08:29,973
Lower your weapons.

1590
02:08:30,045 --> 02:08:32,479
For goodness sake,
put them down!

1591
02:08:36,885 --> 02:08:40,480
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then?

1592
02:08:41,356 --> 02:08:42,914
It is.

1593
02:08:51,433 --> 02:08:55,199
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1594
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:57,795
I think we've all arrived
at a special place.

1595
02:08:57,873 --> 02:08:58,931
Spiritually.

1596
02:08:59,007 --> 02:09:01,100
Ecumenically.

1597
02:09:01,176 --> 02:09:03,201
Grammatically.

1598
02:09:03,879 --> 02:09:07,542
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

1599
02:09:07,616 --> 02:09:08,981
Know that.

1600
02:09:12,921 --> 02:09:14,218
Elizabeth.

1601
02:09:16,191 --> 02:09:19,490
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1602
02:09:20,829 --> 02:09:22,126
I'm sorry.

1603
02:09:24,433 --> 02:09:25,229
Will.

1604
02:09:27,736 --> 02:09:29,169
Nice hat.

1605
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:32,732
Friends.

1606
02:09:34,877 --> 02:09:37,971
This is a day that you will
always remember

1607
02:09:38,046 --> 02:09:39,411
as the day that...

1608
02:09:44,887 --> 02:09:48,482
Idiot. He has nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1609
02:09:49,658 --> 02:09:51,990
Sail ho!

1610
02:09:59,568 --> 02:10:02,196
What's your plan of action?

1611
02:10:02,838 --> 02:10:04,135
Sir?

1612
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:10,674
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1613
02:10:10,746 --> 02:10:14,773
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1614
02:10:14,850 --> 02:10:18,877
piracy itself
can be the right course?

1615
02:10:22,925 --> 02:10:24,859
Mr. Turner.

1616
02:10:30,232 --> 02:10:33,030
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1617
02:10:38,941 --> 02:10:41,068
This is a beautiful sword.

1618
02:10:43,211 --> 02:10:46,703
I would expect the man who
made it to show the same care

1619
02:10:46,782 --> 02:10:49,717
in every aspect of his life.

1620
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:53,483
Thank you.

1621
02:10:56,124 --> 02:10:58,058
Commodore!

1622
02:10:58,126 --> 02:10:59,889
What about Sparrow?

1623
02:11:01,063 --> 02:11:04,760
Well, I think we can afford to
give him one day's head start.

1624
02:11:10,505 --> 02:11:11,335
So.

1625
02:11:12,774 --> 02:11:16,369
This is the path
you've chosen, is it?

1626
02:11:17,713 --> 02:11:22,616
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1627
02:11:22,684 --> 02:11:24,049
No.

1628
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:30,849
He's a pirate.

1629
02:11:55,751 --> 02:11:57,480
Heave!

1630
02:12:07,329 --> 02:12:10,264
Thought you were supposed to
keep to the Code.

1631
02:12:10,332 --> 02:12:14,462
We figured they were
more actual guidelines.

1632
02:12:18,573 --> 02:12:20,336
Thank you.

1633
02:12:21,343 --> 02:12:23,243
Captain Sparrow.

1634
02:12:27,049 --> 02:12:29,244
The Black Pearl is yours.

1635
02:12:44,433 --> 02:12:46,162
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

1636
02:12:46,234 --> 02:12:47,963
Hands to braces!

1637
02:12:48,036 --> 02:12:50,504
Let down and haul to run free!

1638
02:12:51,873 --> 02:12:56,173
Now, bring me that horizon.

1639
02:12:57,546 --> 02:13:00,413
