Producer Choi Pyung-ho
Hey, listen.

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,220
I know I'm not the usual big shot

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,350
you're used to dealing with,
but a deal this small?

11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,190
I can manage on my own.

12
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,630
I've got connection in In-sa-dong.

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,100
In-sa-dong is great.

14
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,000
Since it's my first time,

15
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,200
I wasn't sure what to do.

16
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,510
But I'll make sure to give you
a fat commission.

17
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,070
Thank you for that.
Let's see the goods.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,480
Sure, sure.

19
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,380
Ahh, now,

20
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,680
this is called the Blue Dragon Tea Cup

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,690
used by the Ming Dynasty nobles.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,290
I hear it goes
at 300 million Yen in Japan.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
- How much?
- 300 million Yen

24
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,300
I own this tiny shop,

25
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,500
so I go to China to get merchandise.

26
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,910
Last trip to Guangzhou,
I bought this off an old Chinese man.

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,470
Then as soon as
I get back to Korea,

28
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,880
that old man gets arrested by
PSB(China's public security bureau)

29
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,780
- For smuggling cultural properties
- Oh yeah?

30
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,410
This old man,

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,790
he'd run errands for
Japanese scholars during the war

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,290
and stashed away a few artifacts.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,190
Not knowing its worth,
he gave it to me for nothing.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,600
Wow, you lucked out.

35
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:21,201
<i><font color=yellow>Subtitle by</font></i>
<b><font color=red>Aldi Arman</font></b>

36
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,300
The timing was impeccable.

37
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,140
At first he didn't want to sell.

38
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,000
Why?

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,810
Some Korean dude

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,870
begged the old man to sell
the goods to him.

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,280
I was like, 'This is it! '
'This is the stuff.'

42
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,680
So I called higher.

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,190
- How much?
- 5 grand

44
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,080
- How much?
- 5 grand

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,980
Haha, you lucky bastard.

46
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,990
High-five!

47
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,290
Whoever he was,
what a poor schmuck.

48
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,300
Let me shake your hand, man.

49
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,600
That's me.

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,190
What?

51
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,310
That poor schmuck.
That was me, you jerk.

52
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,170
Wait, wait...

53
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,180
It took me over 2 months
to locate the stuff.

54
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,280
Then you showed up,
and I missed it by two hours?

55
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,490
What's this?

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,790
Blue Dragon Tea Cup

57
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,590
Don't you think I know that?
Where is it?

58
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,190
- At home
- Where?

59
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,000
At home, at home, home...

60
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,700
I hid it at home.

61
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,600
No one knows.
Not even my wife.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,100
Mr. Chang-In Ghang!

63
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,780
It's the police.

64
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,570
Did you call the cops, huh?

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,150
- Are you Chang-in Ghang?
- Yes

66
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,320
Chang-In Ghang,
you're under arrest

67
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,830
for violation of
cultural protection act.

68
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,720
Where's your warrant?

69
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,770
Show me the warrant.
Where are you taking me? It hurts!

70
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,400
Call it in.

71
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,700
Let's go.

72
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,200
Check the roof, go!

73
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,500
Man down. Man down.

74
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,540
Male, mid-30s. John Doe.

75
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,300
Fell from the roof top
during the arrest.

76
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,100
Villain and Widow

77
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,480
You're in 80 km/h zone.

78
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,980
Please slow down.

79
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,480
Turn it down!

80
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,190
Alarm disabled. Welcome.

81
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm never going to see
the grandparents again,

82
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,510
not even for the holidays.

83
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,770
I don't know why we keep going.
Dad's not around anymore.

84
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,970
That's enough.

85
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,290
You have to weed
the yard after it rains...

86
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,100
Your home is now secured.

87
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,210
Your yard's full of weed.

88
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,370
What?

89
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,970
You need to weed it out
to grow something.

90
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,780
We don't grow anything anymore.

91
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,580
We buy everything from the store
with pesticide all over them.

92
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,980
Why do I even bother...

93
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,630
Room Available to Rent

94
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,880
So, Mr. Ghang's never seen
the goods in person...

95
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,860
The Chinese who sold the stuff
got caught by PSB for smuggling.

96
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,990
It was just bad timing.

97
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,800
Didn't you guys look into it?

98
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,390
Yeah, we figured out
what's going on.

99
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,800
Well, then.

100
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,400
We just bring you the goods,
get it appraised,

101
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,210
And if it is good, you pay us.

102
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,380
If it isn't, you don't.
What's the big deal?

103
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,210
I believe my boss is entitled
to an explanation.

104
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,480
Entitled?

105
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,880
Not that I doubt
your abilities, Mr. Ghang

106
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,790
I just want to make sure
if you need any help,

107
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,590
say, more people

108
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,600
No, I don't need more people.

109
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,330
Well, if there aren't any questions,
we'll see ourselves out.

110
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,880
He's paying us 2 million dollars.
Was it so hard to be nice?

111
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,080
Is he really the president
of this company?

112
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,080
What do you mean?

113
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,080
Why is he handling things directly?

114
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,680
Is that a problem?

115
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,390
He needs to delegate to his people.

116
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,290
He's too exposed from the start.

117
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,400
He's just really desperate.

118
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,300
He's got a gallery
at the headquarters.

119
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,210
He took 10 million from arts budget
behind his father's back

120
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,470
for money laundering and
lost everything in bad investment.

121
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,380
So he needs something
to make up for it, right away.

122
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,280
Pardon me.

123
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,980
My name is Mr. Song.

124
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,080
If you need anything,
please call me any time.

125
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,090
Who's the midget?

126
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,300
Some punk.

127
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,900
Mr. Ha takes him around
as his bodyguard.

128
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,210
Show off at the clubs, you know.

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,580
Real mature.

130
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,680
Don't underestimate
residential security system.

131
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,590
You can go in and out
of a jewelry shop in a minute,

132
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,990
but this takes at least 3 to 4 days.

133
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,290
You look into the security company.

134
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,390
Who's got time to research all that?

135
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,590
Delaying will upset Mr. Ha.

136
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,190
Why should I care,
he hasn't paid me up front.

137
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,900
Can't you just tie them up
and go through the house?

138
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,200
It's only a woman and her daughter.

139
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,280
Sure, because when I untie them,

140
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,150
she'll say 'Thank you'.
Just like that. Sure.

141
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,980
Just make sure they won't
want to call the cops.

142
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,280
How do I do that?

143
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,790
- You know how.
- Seriously, how?

144
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,490
You know... just...

145
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,890
Must I say it out loud?

146
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,790
What if it goes bad?

147
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,300
I'd have to rot in jail
for another 5~6 years.

148
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,200
Chang-In, life is all about
preparing for the future.

149
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,200
That requires money.

150
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,800
This is my last chance.

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm old.

152
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,670
This guy is paying us
2 million at once. In cash!

153
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,980
Opportunities like this
don't come again.

154
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,880
This is literally, 'show me the money'.
'Show me the money! '

155
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,590
How about just 3 grand?

156
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,100
It must be hard for you, too.

157
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,580
Anyone interested in renting
my spare room upstairs?

158
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,380
That's not an easy sale.

159
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,180
It's just a room, in someone's home.

160
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,280
Don't young people look for studios?

161
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,390
Why would kids want to live
in your neighborhood?

162
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,690
They want to live in the city.

163
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,980
Mom, I want to get my eyes done.

164
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,180
Mom, please? Can I?

165
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,090
Please?

166
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,090
Your eyes are just fine.

167
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,890
You're not ugly.

168
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,690
I am ugly.

169
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,490
No wonder I can't get any parts.

170
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,900
You didn't fail your auditions
because you're ugly.

171
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,400
It's because you can't act.

172
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,410
I want cosmetic surgery!

173
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,600
I have no money.

174
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,870
You always say that.
Come on, mom.

175
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,380
Please? Just once?!

176
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,470
- I got no money. None.
- Surgery!

177
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,480
No money. No money.
Your mom never has any.

178
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,600
Who is it?

179
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,510
I'm here to check out your room.

180
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,970
This room is really perfect
for just one person.

181
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,690
I don't mean to be rude,
but what kind of work do you do?

182
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,190
What do I look like I do?

183
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,490
Since you came all the way
out here for a room,

184
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,500
You probably need
a quiet work space

185
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,300
You're right. I'm a writer.

186
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,480
I see, what kind of writer?

187
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,680
I write trashy comments
on the Internet.

188
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,680
Excuse me?

189
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,080
I'm kidding.

190
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,880
I write novels.

191
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,900
Oh, you're an author.

192
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,990
No, not a big author.

193
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,690
I'm a bit peculiar.

194
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,000
I just can't write in hotel rooms,

195
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,900
and the city is too loud.

196
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,500
This neighborhood is really quiet.

197
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,370
Oh yeah?

198
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,380
Well, the room seems just fine.

199
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,470
Could I trouble you for a cup of tea?

200
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,200
How long does it take to write?

201
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,900
Well, it depends on the book.

202
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,410
This one,
I think maybe about a month.

203
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,570
So you're looking
for short-term lease.

204
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,080
Yes, I am.

205
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,080
Wow, you have a nice view.

206
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,090
Hmm? Yeah.

207
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,590
How are the neighbors?

208
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,560
Do they visit each other often?

209
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,620
No, not really.

210
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,390
They're mostly old folks
being concerned.

211
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,990
Here's your tea.

212
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,590
Thank you.

213
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,600
Hmm, this tea is Tie Guan Yin.

214
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,940
You must know a lot about tea.

215
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,380
Not at all.
I just enjoy tea from time to time.

216
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,980
- By the way, .
- Yes?

217
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,290
It's customary to charge
two months' rent upfront.

218
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,990
One month rent is
impossible to find, anywhere.

219
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,190
You're home.
How was school?

220
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,090
What's this?

221
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,990
Where are your manners?

222
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,100
- I'm really sorry. Excuse me.
- Sure.

223
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,390
What is the matter with you?

224
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,190
Who is he?

225
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,700
He's here to see the room.

226
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,600
That guy? Alone?
Are you crazy?

227
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,000
Who are you calling crazy?

228
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,600
Can't you tell?
He's a writer. A gentleman.

229
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,800
No way.

230
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,840
Why not?

231
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,470
Where else will we
get money from, huh?

232
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,570
I can't exactly afford to
turn him down.

233
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,580
Well, I don't like him.
Send him back.

234
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,880
Send him where? Keep it down.

235
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,890
I said no.

236
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,080
He'll hear you.
Be quiet, Seong-Ah Hahm!

237
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,990
Get him out, now!

238
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,680
He stays.
Settle down!

239
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,780
I don't like him.

240
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,190
Be quiet, Seong-Ah Hahm! Hush!

241
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,290
I don't like him!

242
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,090
I said be quiet!

243
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,600
Oh, you really don't have much stuff.

244
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,670
All a writer needs are his laptop
and a desk. What else?

245
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,180
You're annoying.

246
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,890
Who rents a room to steal
a piece of china?

247
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,090
This is the only way to discretely
look for it without the fuss.

248
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,690
I can't afford to get in trouble
by tying up those girls.

249
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,610
Do you want the table here?

250
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,770
Oh, you're here.

251
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,870
Shouldn't we sign
a lease or something?

252
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,180
Should I ask the realtor?

253
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,680
Oh, no problem.
I don't care if we do.

254
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,790
I just don't want to waste
any money on brokerage fees.

255
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,980
I'm only here for two months.

256
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,800
Hey, you must be uncomfortable.

257
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,300
I should show you some ID.

258
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,590
Oh no.
I didn't mean it like that.

259
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,690
No, no. We should be clear on this.

260
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,230
My publisher says even authors
need business cards nowadays.

261
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,830
Hyeong-Gook Park, Author
Mangook Publishing

262
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,970
- Well, make yourself at home.
- Okay.

263
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,980
- See you later.
- Bye.

264
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,090
Did you get a tenant?
I saw a man.

265
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,590
Yes, I rented out the room upstairs.

266
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,890
A man moved into a house of two girls.

267
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,690
He's a writer.
He writes novels.

268
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,300
A man who's a writer
moved into a house of two girls.

269
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,680
What's up?

270
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,490
- Um, sir.
- Yes?

271
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,400
- I'm really sorry, but...
- Yeah?

272
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,200
- I've been thinking and...
- Well, ma'am,

273
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,300
I paid you
two months' rent upfront, right?

274
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,470
Yes, two months.

275
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,270
Then I have the right to live here
for two months, right?

276
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,680
Why, of course...

277
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,490
Did you want to say something?

278
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,580
Um, would you like
some dinner?

279
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,290
I only eat fruits when I write.

280
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,690
- How about some tea?
- No thank you.

281
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,700
Well, you should get some rest then.

282
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,700
Okay, then.

283
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,700
Good night.

284
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,770
Who's she think she's dealing with?

285
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,600
I love you.

286
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,290
Seong-Ah Hahm!

287
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,600
- Oh my...
- He's so hot, isn't he?

288
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,800
Look at you pretending
like you don't know.

289
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,400
I really don't know.

290
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,600
- You really don't know?
- I don't.

291
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,170
- You went karaoke-ing that time.
- How would I know that?

292
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,270
Then she's all mine.

293
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,310
Let's see who wins this battle.

294
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,080
- You're home early.
- Yeah

295
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,280
It isn't much, but this is Bolay tea.

296
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,290
I thought you might
appreciate gourmet tea.

297
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,990
Oh, thank you.

298
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,890
I haven't tried it yet...

299
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,500
I haven't had that tea, yet.

300
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,600
Oh, would you like some tea?

301
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,200
No, you don't have to.

302
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,210
Thank you.

303
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,370
- Give me a minute.
- Sure.

304
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,790
You have a lot of plants here.

305
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,490
Yeah.

306
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,300
It's interesting to put them
on the steps like this.

307
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,770
- By the way, sir.
- Yes?

308
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,680
What kind of story are you writing?

309
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,070
Well, that's...

310
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,390
What I'm writing is...
about a woman.

311
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,200
Once she had many dreams.
She was pretty.

312
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,090
But one day, she looked back

313
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,900
and those days were gone.

314
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,980
This isn't the life she wanted.

315
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,680
She's like my sister,
crying in front of a mirror.

316
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,890
That's what I'm working on.

317
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,780
Speaking of,

318
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,290
Could I come down
to interview you sometimes?

319
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,690
Me?

320
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,430
Yes.

321
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,800
I think you're similar
to the character in my novel.

322
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,170
Well, I don't have much of a story.

323
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,180
No, no.

324
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,980
Everyone is the main character
in their life story.

325
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:59,380
Oh that. I put up bricks
and plastered with cement.

326
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,090
- Cement?
- Yeah.

327
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,190
You plastered the wall with cement?

328
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,900
Yeah, so it's quiet.

329
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,780
- The whole wall?
- Yes, completely.

330
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,490
- Have a seat, sir.
- Okay.

331
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,190
- Well, sir.
- Yes?

332
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,400
I'd hate to bring this up again,

333
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,410
but I asked around and

334
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,600
even a short-term tenant

335
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,870
should pay a deposit.

336
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,880
- Really?
- Yes.

337
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,880
If you can't come up
with the deposit right away,

338
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,580
maybe you can pay more rent?

339
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,390
Isn't it like 100 dollars more
for every 10 grand?

340
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,090
Well, you're right.
I will get it to you.

341
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,400
Good. I will write up the lease.

342
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,500
I thought I told you
I don't need the lease.

343
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,970
Hey, Seong-Ah.

344
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,480
Sorry about her.

345
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,680
She's going through puberty.

346
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,480
No worries.

347
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,390
Not like it's the first time
she's being rude.

348
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,190
Where did you learn to behave
like this, in front of an elder?

349
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,590
How would that make me look?

350
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,090
He's hanging out here now?

351
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,000
Don't overreact.
He's just having tea.

352
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,190
I hate him. Make him leave.

353
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,900
Why are you acting so weird?

354
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,700
He must feel so uncomfortable.

355
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,760
Why are you treating him
like he's fecal matter?

356
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,900
How nice, comparing me to shit.

357
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,570
Why can't you be
considerate of others?

358
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,270
Whatever.
I hate him. Send him home.

359
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,680
How come you hate
so many things, huh?

360
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,180
Hey, you're still up studying.

361
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,790
I just came out for some air.
I couldn't write.

362
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,590
Alright then.

363
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,500
Here, buy yourself a book.

364
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,970
No discipline around here, huh?

365
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,210
What do you mean,
you can't get through the stairs?

366
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,920
She brick-walled it and
plastered cement all over.

367
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,080
And you moved in without
even checking that out?

368
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,760
Don't get upset.
I'll take care of it.

369
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,190
We assured them
it'll only take 3~4 days.

370
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,590
Tell them to wait a few.

371
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,600
And send me money for the deposit.

372
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,900
Wow, it's really nice in here.

373
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,170
Did you decorate it yourself?

374
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,180
With my husband.

375
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,980
Here. What you asked.

376
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,480
By the way, I need to use
the Internet for research,

377
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,390
but I don't get Internet connection
from my room.

378
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,090
Could I use the computer downstairs?

379
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,190
Well, the computer...

380
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,100
The additional deposit.
Two months worth.

381
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,190
Thank you.

382
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,400
I'll only need
to use it for 3~4 days.

383
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,110
That's not going to work.

384
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,800
What?

385
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,080
It doesn't look good if you're
downstairs by yourself during the day.

386
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,680
Well, I'll be quiet during the day.
Who's going to see me?

387
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,190
There used to be some unique items
here when the husband was around.

388
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,290
The husband died
in a unique fashion last year.

389
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,090
Did I say something wrong?

390
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,790
It's okay.
You didn't kill him.

391
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,500
If it's Internet fee,
I will pay you.

392
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,100
I even gave you the deposit.

393
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,570
Wait a minute.

394
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,370
I rightfully deserved that deposit.

395
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,080
Come on.

396
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,980
Seriously, I only need
a month to finish writing,

397
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,180
but I paid rent for two months.

398
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,380
Then you asked for more deposit,
which I paid.

399
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,390
Still, you won't
let me use the Internet?

400
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,090
Nowhere in this country
can you rent a room for one month,

401
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,690
not unless it's a motel.

402
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,200
There's a cyber cafe down the street.

403
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,000
How can a writer work in a cyber cafe?

404
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,500
There are loud kids,
playing games.

405
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,600
Why are you yelling at me?

406
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,770
When did I yell?

407
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,180
It's just the Internet.

408
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,970
Just go to the cyber cafe, go!

409
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,100
It's been a while.

410
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,600
You must be out of your prescription.

411
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,080
It must be half-life.

412
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,780
The pills are not working anymore.

413
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,280
You still can't sleep
without drinking?

414
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,690
But I don't drink hard liquor.

415
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,490
I only drink wine or beer.

416
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,390
It doesn't matter what kind
of alcohol you drink.

417
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,400
I told you many times.
Drinking every night isn't good for you.

418
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,590
Do you still often get irritated?

419
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:18,190
But, that's not depression.

420
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:23,570
Getting angry with people
around you, saying things you regret.

421
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,170
That can also cause you
to feel depressed.

422
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,070
Doctor, please.
Stop staring at me like that.

423
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,550
What?

424
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,380
It feels like your eyes are
shooting sharp knives at me.

425
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,580
I know it's rude of me to say,
but your eyes don't look right.

426
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,680
Just when I'm ready
to share with you,

427
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,690
I see your eyes and shut up.

428
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,290
I was just walking by and saw,

429
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,390
Jeong-Shim Kim, Psychiatrist

430
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,990
and thought you were
a female doctor.

431
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,800
What kind of man
has a name Jeong-Shim?

432
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,200
Honestly, if you were a woman,

433
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,900
Maybe I'd feel
more comfortable sharing.

434
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,410
But when I'm with you,

435
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,170
I feel like a kid getting
scorned by a teacher.

436
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,180
Why can't you make
your patient feel at ease?

437
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,580
All you do is criticize
and pick me apart.

438
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,080
It's not too late.

439
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,190
Feel free to go else where.
To a female doctor.

440
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,780
And my apologies
my family named me a girly name.

441
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,890
Do you angry?

442
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,500
Next time, try this doctor.

443
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,490
She is really feminine.

444
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,780
Got Milk? Girl Seong-Ah Hahm Today

445
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,790
Best Comment:
Did you put shit in your milk?

446
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,000
Mom, the kids are...

447
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,100
Yeah?

448
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,370
Nothing. Goodnight.

449
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,470
Go to sleep.

450
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,590
What are you doing here?
What if someone sees you?

451
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,900
How is your writing coming along?

452
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,700
How can I write,
when I can't use the Internet?

453
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,480
- Hey, Mister
- Huh?

454
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,080
- Can you buy me a drink?
- What?

455
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,490
What is your name?

456
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,090
Oh, it's Yeon-Joo.
Yeon-Joo Choi.

457
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,200
Yeon-Joo Choi...
Yeon as in "become" and Joo as in "jewel"

458
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,290
Joo as in "house"

459
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,500
Joo as in "house"
because you own the house.

460
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,470
You know, sir.

461
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,980
Do you really think my story
can be used for your book?

462
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,580
Sure.

463
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:26,180
I'm not good at logically telling

464
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,990
a story about my circumstances.

465
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,790
No, no, no. I can totally relate.

466
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,800
I haven't said anything, yet.

467
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,100
Desperation.

468
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:46,070
Something that desperately
asks me to hear you out.

469
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,270
That's hit my imagination.

470
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,580
Hit you?

471
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,780
When did I hit you?

472
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:58,480
Listen, lady.
You must be my muse.

473
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,090
I will repay you with a great story.

474
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,290
Excuse me.
I have to go to the restroom.

475
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,790
Okay.

476
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,770
How long to copy this?

477
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,080
I'll try to be back by dawn.

478
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,380
That's too late.

479
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,080
Just keep her occupied.
You're good at it.

480
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,290
I got married
straight out of high school.

481
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,390
No wonder...

482
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,600
I thought it was weird
you have a kid in junior high.

483
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,300
Thirty-five.

484
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,900
I'm an oldie in her mid-thirties.

485
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,880
So weird.

486
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,510
Koreans just love it when you say
they look a year or two younger.

487
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,570
If they love looking younger so much,

488
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,580
let's count our age the exact way,

489
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,380
like they do in European Union.

490
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,690
Then you can be
in your early thirties.

491
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,390
Early thirties.

492
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,890
Feels different, right?

493
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,000
You're really good with words.

494
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,560
You know, us writers,
we keep a hundred,

495
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,300
no thousands of thoughts
in our heads to get one thing out.

496
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,570
- You're like a con artist.
- What?

497
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,280
Nothing.

498
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,290
Hey, here. One more.

499
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,790
It goes in,
but keeps getting errors.

500
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,290
I know, but I'm in a hurry.

501
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,090
What, depression?

502
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,390
At first, I couldn't figure out
what I was feeling.

503
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,610
It was all so sudden, new emotions.
I was going crazy.

504
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,270
I know. Steel doesn't get
rusty overnight.

505
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,880
It takes a lot of time,
being exposed to sun,

506
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,890
and getting rusty by rain.

507
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,590
Sometimes, even washing dishes
seems like an impossible task.

508
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,790
Fatigue. Simple routine life.

509
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:22,100
It's easy for homemakers
to get depression.

510
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,660
Work out.

511
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,200
Before going to bed,

512
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,100
if you run an hour on the treadmill,

513
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,700
you'll fall asleep like a baby.

514
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,470
I thought this was my interview.

515
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,570
Shouldn't you be listening to me?
Stop interrupting.

516
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,380
I was just trying to help.

517
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,580
Who asked you to help?

518
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,690
Since you're a writer,

519
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,590
I thought you'd be a good listener

520
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,290
But I guess not.
All Korean men are the same.

521
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,600
Any old guy can
just tell you what to do,

522
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,800
like they have a license
to give advice, issued by government.

523
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,070
What? You've never seen
a woman smoke before?

524
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,080
- Sir!
- Yes

525
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,980
It's my interview.
Let me do the talking.

526
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:10,780
Okay.

527
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,110
You know, lately

528
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,280
I can't sleep, at all.

529
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,690
My body is so tired,
but I can't fall asleep.

530
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,190
But I can't just get up again.
It wears me out all night.

531
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,920
By the time I close my eyes
it's already morning.

532
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,290
Then when I wake up,

533
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,390
I feel depressed all over again.

534
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,900
'I should get out of bed.'
'I should shower first.'

535
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,370
'I have to send the kid to school.'

536
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,270
'I have to do the dishes.'

537
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,970
But I just stay in bed crying.

538
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,480
'Here's another terrible day.'

539
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,890
Hey,

540
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,700
Where are you going?

541
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,190
Let's have one more drink.
Just one more.

542
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,390
I've already had too much.

543
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,300
But I'm not done interviewing you.

544
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,600
Later. Do it later.

545
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,100
What are you doing?

546
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,280
I want to know more about you.

547
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,180
No, don't.

548
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,180
Do you want to know how
to slow down time?

549
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,480
You have to experience something new.

550
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,990
Something you've never
experienced before.

551
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,490
You're still in early thirties.

552
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,900
Early thirties.

553
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,500
According to EU.

554
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,480
You're still young and beautiful.

555
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,070
I'm beautiful?

556
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,690
Young and beautiful, Yeon-Joo.

557
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,990
Don't be sad.

558
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:47,710
A woman as beautiful as you
deserves to enjoy life.

559
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,570
I've been meaning to tell you.

560
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,770
I like how your voice resonates.

561
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,670
I feel like I'm in a bathroom.

562
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,690
Yeon-Joo.

563
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,790
Yes, sir.

564
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,370
Am I late? Where's the girl?

565
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,780
In my room. I gotta get back.

566
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,980
Is this why you moved in?

567
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,680
Have your cake and eat it, too?

568
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,480
Bastard.

569
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,090
- Yeon-Joo
- No

570
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,100
Yeon-Joo

571
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,190
I have to go back before she wakes up.

572
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,500
Oh, Yeon-Joo

573
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,370
Sir, I have to send her to school.

574
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,180
Okay.

575
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,480
Yeon-Joo.

576
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,080
See you later tonight.

577
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,490
Promise?

578
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,090
Man, that was close.

579
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,890
Nothing in life is easy.

580
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,390
What are you doing?

581
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,090
I missed you, Yeon-Joo.

582
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,400
Last night didn't happen, okay?

583
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:53,880
Yes, I found something in
the same shape with different print.

584
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:56,570
Yes, two.
I'll bring them over.

585
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,000
- Any word?
- Not yet.

586
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,380
They said it won't take long.

587
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,480
Could he be of help?

588
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,220
Sir, there are a lot of eyes watching.

589
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,880
Having someone like him
come to the office is a little...

590
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,220
He's a hard worker.
Why are you being mean?

591
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,020
I wasn't being mean, but...

592
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,890
Hey, Mr. Song!

593
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,100
Why are you so frigid?

594
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,170
Hey, Seong-Ah.
What are you doing? Be quiet.

595
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,370
I didn't do anything!

596
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,090
Mr. Upstairs

597
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,100
Caller ID: Landlady

598
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,480
Why aren't you in school?

599
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,390
Seong-Ah Hahm, don't you hear me?

600
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,480
Let go of me.

601
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,580
Do I have to get called in to school?

602
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,990
Then don't go.

603
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,990
Then stay out till sundown.

604
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,090
Don't come home and get on my nerves!

605
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,300
I came to get my bag.

606
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,970
Nicely done. Good job.

607
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,770
Don't skip out
on your after-school academy!

608
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:04,610
Your home is now secured.

609
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,480
Mister.

610
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,980
I've been so worried.

611
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,790
You weren't around for days,
not picking up your phone.

612
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,100
The door was open.

613
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,800
I'll leave now.

614
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,000
What's wrong with you?

615
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,570
Oh my... what happened?

616
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,490
I'm not that great a woman.

617
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,180
Ah, Yeon-Joo...

618
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,290
I'm really tired.

619
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,900
I know. I know what you mean.

620
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,400
No, Yeon-Joo. That's not...

621
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,800
- Mister.
- Yeah

622
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,700
Don't say anything.

623
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,070
No, Yeon-Joo.

624
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,170
It hurts me, too.

625
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:19,080
Yeon-Joo. You're choking me.
It hurts.

626
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,600
So it wasn't in the basement?

627
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,870
I went through everything.
It's not there.

628
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,070
You didn't answer your phone for days.

629
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,480
They thought you bailed
and went ballistic.

630
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,380
Don't worry about them.

631
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,980
They want it, they can wait.

632
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,580
How could I not worry?

633
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,190
They kept asking for the address.
You didn't pick up the phone...

634
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:12,190
Hurry up.

635
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:19,691
<i><font color=yellow>Subtitle by</font></i>
<b><font color=red>Aldi Arman</font></b>

636
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,980
Nothing seems to be missing.

637
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,280
Has this happened before?

638
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,490
No, first time in this house.

639
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:36,290
Any new faces lurking
around the house?

640
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,890
No one's home during the day,
so I don't know.

641
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:40,990
Even at night, not sure...

642
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,400
There's one upstairs.
The writer guy.

643
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,300
Who is he?

644
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:49,600
No, he's not.
Don't worry about it.

645
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,370
How can I not worry?

646
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,970
A man moves in with my neighbor
and they get robbed...

647
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:00,880
Why don't you
mind your own business?

648
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,580
Where were you during the day?

649
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,990
Did you see anybody suspicious?

650
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,990
Think about it.

651
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,580
A man moves into a house
with two girls...

652
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,790
then something like this happens.

653
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,600
- Goodnight!
- You, too.

654
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,080
Hyeong-Gook Park

655
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,180
Hyeong-Gook Park, author

656
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,890
No search result

657
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:52,400
Mr. President.
What are you trying to do here?

658
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:58,680
Our people underestimated it
because it was a residential house.

659
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,880
I apologize.

660
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,780
Stay out of grown-up business and

661
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:20,190
go play with your friends,
okay midget?

662
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,900
Mr. President.

663
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:29,800
Do you think I don't know how
to handle a girl?

664
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:33,470
Your whole stunt was
caught on security camera.

665
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:37,570
If any one of them talks,
your name will come up.

666
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:43,090
A rich kid hires thugs
to steal a piece of china...

667
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:45,490
Your dad will be proud.

668
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,490
Mr. Ghang.
Think of Mr. Ha's position.

669
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,790
Wrap it up.

670
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,400
Mr. President. Do you really
want the Blue Dragon Tea Cup?

671
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:02,000
Yes, of course.
Mr. Ghang, I want it.

672
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:05,770
Then if you'd just let me
be as I asked,

673
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,180
it will all be resolved soon.

674
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,380
Why are you being uncooperative?

675
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:18,580
If this is what you want,
let's call the whole thing off.

676
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:21,590
Don't be like that now, Mr. Ghang.

677
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:26,190
Just hang in there, okay?
Keep it up.

678
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:30,790
Mr. Ghang. Let's go now, okay?

679
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,070
He's the one not keeping
his word, isn't he?

680
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:47,980
I can understand where
Mr. Ghang is coming from.

681
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,880
Whose side are you on?

682
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,080
I'm not siding with him.
It's just...

683
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,490
If things go wrong,

684
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,490
it won't be good for the company

685
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,190
Stop it. Man, you're frigid!

686
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,900
You should lay low
until this gig is over.

687
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:04,700
What's this?

688
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,600
Wanted for fraud: Chang-In Ghang

689
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:09,700
A few years ago,
you did some work with Mr. Kwon?

690
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:12,170
That was ages ago.

691
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,680
Mr. Kwon is in custody.

692
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,280
Everyone is getting arrested.

693
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,870
Dumbasses.

694
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:22,980
You keep stalling,
you'll be caught too.

695
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:27,510
I was planning on leaving the country
after this gig anyway.

696
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,820
You know the kid from back when

697
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:32,590
he's got a golf club
in the Philippines.

698
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,290
He said he'll let me in,
if I brought a few hundred grand.

699
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,990
Wake up.

700
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:41,300
He's playing you.

701
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,500
Mind your own business?

702
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,600
- What?
- What?

703
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:46,200
Should I stay home tomorrow?

704
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,000
Why?

705
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,870
You know why.

706
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,980
To be with me?

707
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,580
You should go to work.

708
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:11,590
Modern women are beautiful
when they're at work.

709
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,600
Come here.
I'll tuck you in.

710
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,010
And you'll go to work tomorrow.

711
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,700
Okay.

712
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:32,680
Alarm disabled. Welcome.

713
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,670
Shouldn't you be in school?

714
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:09,280
Well, how do I say this?

715
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,990
When I was your age,

716
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,690
I didn't want to go to school either.

717
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,600
You can stay there, you know.

718
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,400
There were some difficult times.

719
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:25,800
Wait!

720
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,270
- Yeon-Joo.
- Hi, sir.

721
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,980
Your daughter is home.

722
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,780
So?

723
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:46,980
Shouldn't she be in school
at this hour?

724
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,990
Pay no attention.

725
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,390
She'll be fine in a few days.

726
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,490
A few days?

727
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:57,530
No. In EU,

728
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,130
not sending your kids to school
is considered child endangerment.

729
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,430
Watch yourself!

730
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:07,100
No, as a member of UNICEF,
I must say something.

731
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,410
Send her to school.

732
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,880
That's the right thing
to do as a parent.

733
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,320
Why did you skip school again?
You made me look bad.

734
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,220
What's going on with you lately?

735
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,020
Since when do you care
about my school?

736
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,610
When have I not cared?

737
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:24,220
What other mom drives her kid
to the school every morning?

738
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,820
You wanted to practice driving.

739
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,130
What's gotten into you today?

740
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,430
Don't even think about
getting your face fixed.

741
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,090
Fix your personality first!

742
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,770
My face can be fixed,
but not my personality.

743
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,710
Because I was born mean.

744
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,000
Mom, you've got it better though.

745
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,810
You're pretty
even with bad personality.

746
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,210
What a thing to say to her mother!?

747
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,510
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

748
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,910
You've never done anything for me.
Why start being a mom now?

749
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,920
Some mothers toss
their kids off the balcony,

750
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,580
Because they don't want to raise them.

751
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,590
You should be thankful.

752
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,590
And she calls herself a mom.

753
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,370
I was only nineteen years old.

754
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,680
If I hadn't given birth to her...

755
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,380
You shouldn't say such a thing.

756
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:22,180
That miserable bastard.
My father-in-law.

757
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,590
I had dreams. I wanted to do things.

758
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:29,390
Which is more the reason
to focus on Seong-Ah.

759
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,090
Send her to school and

760
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,100
I was always by her side
when she was little

761
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,400
and going on commercial shoots
and television.

762
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:38,900
I thought she was going
to become a huge star.

763
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:40,800
She was pretty like me
when she was little.

764
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,400
She's still pretty, just as long as
she doesn't skip school...

765
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:44,870
Yeah, she's pretty.

766
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,470
She's okay, but her personality
is not pretty.

767
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:52,010
Whenever I saw her
father's face in her,

768
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:52,950
I just...

769
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:58,990
Full of stupid hopes
to run a big business,

770
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,080
investing in all kinds of failure

771
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,290
All he left me
is just the tiny store.

772
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,990
What am I supposed to do now?

773
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:10,200
Yeon-Joo, calm down.

774
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,100
Just focus on Seong-Ah.

775
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,400
We should've bought
an apartment building, like I said.

776
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,270
A house with a yard. A yard?

777
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,210
When he was obsessed
with getting a yard,

778
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,570
I should have stopped him,

779
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,870
And bought an apartment!

780
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:28,480
You know the quarterly financial
meeting at HQ on Monday?

781
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,580
So?

782
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,180
Gallery purchases will be included.

783
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:37,090
Isn't the gallery spending
not open to public?

784
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,390
Your father gave the order.

785
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:43,290
Dad?

786
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,000
No one should suspect
I touched the slush fund.

787
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,770
Can Mr. Ghang be trusted?

788
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,570
Is the Blue Dragon Tea cup worth it?

789
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,380
Yes, it is.

790
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,970
It was in the newspapers in China.

791
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:01,380
I mean,

792
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,290
Can I rely on Mr. Ghang
and just wait forever?

793
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,490
I already ate.

794
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:18,700
- A kiss?
- Come on.

795
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:21,200
I'm embarrassed.

796
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,870
Really? A crazy customer?

797
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:26,880
I know right?

798
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,470
- Hey Yeon-Joo?
- Yeah?

799
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,770
I'm writing a really important part.

800
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:34,280
- Can I call you back?
- Okay.

801
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:35,980
Okay, I'll call you right back.

802
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:38,780
Why won't it go through?!

803
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,200
Stop texting.

804
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,080
Let me get some work done.

805
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:13,990
Caller ID: Landlady

806
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:17,690
Who invented mobile phones?!

807
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:25,800
Hello? Yeon-Joo, I miss you.

808
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:29,000
You're coming home? Now?

809
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,800
- What is it?
- What were you spying on?

810
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,090
What do you mean, spy on?

811
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:59,190
You kept watching.
What did you see, grandma?

812
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,300
Who are you calling grandma?

813
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:04,970
Me?

814
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:08,670
Where do I look like a grandma?

815
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,770
You're not exactly middle age,

816
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,280
so what'd you see, grams?

817
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,280
Who cares what I saw?

818
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,580
How am I a grandma?

819
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,590
Look! Look at me!

820
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,390
Let's be careful, neighbor.
Damn!

821
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,890
You be careful, son.

822
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,290
Wow, you've got a lot of stuff.

823
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:30,400
What's good for a housewarming gift?

824
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,560
How much is this?

825
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,480
That's for me.

826
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,680
That man who moved
in your house, the writer.

827
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:55,580
What about him?

828
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,690
I let it go then
because you said it was okay.

829
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,290
But I googled him.
There was no writer with that name.

830
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:05,890
You can find anyone on the Internet.
Isn't that strange?

831
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:09,400
He's not a new comer,
but there are no books.

832
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,370
How old is he?

833
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:14,980
Don't you know?

834
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,480
Are you here to buy something
or ask questions?

835
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:22,680
Well,

836
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,020
How much is this?

837
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,430
$250

838
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,190
Really?

839
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:39,120
This chunk of metal?

840
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,230
It's not even the silver
candlestick from Jean Valjean.

841
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,790
Then, don't bother.

842
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,570
I will buy something next time.

843
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:13,290
Hyeong-Gook Park, Author
Mangook Publishing

844
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,370
- Yes?
- Is this the publishing house?

845
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:25,280
What?

846
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,690
Oh, yeah.
This is Mangook Publishing.

847
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,490
You're close to your destination.

848
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:45,700
You've arrived at your destination.

849
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,100
Re-routing.

850
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,180
You've arrived at your destination.

851
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,690
Entering Mangook Publishing

852
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,990
Mangook Antiques

853
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,500
Hey, Yeon-Joo. You're home early.
My publisher...

854
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,370
Show me everything you've written.

855
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:34,680
You said this place
helps you write better.

856
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,180
What's going on?

857
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,680
Why didn't you want
to sign the lease?

858
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,270
I told you.

859
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:43,380
I'm only here for two months.
I didn't want to waste brokerage fees.

860
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,580
Show me your resident ID card, then.

861
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,590
Alright, alright.

862
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,890
Look at me.

863
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:56,800
Ah, you came from
the publishing house, right?

864
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,500
I was just borrowing
a phone number from a friend.

865
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:05,570
My office is going to officially
open in the city next month.

866
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:09,070
You're going to come, right?

867
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,680
- Are you a gigolo?
- What?

868
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:15,580
Have I been played by a gigolo?

869
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,990
No wonder, you can smooth talk.

870
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,690
Well, guess what?

871
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,990
I don't have any money.

872
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:26,890
The mortgage on this house
isn't paid for.

873
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,300
That one shop? It's all debt.

874
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:30,560
- Come on, Yeon-Joo.
- I've got jack.

875
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,600
Yeon-Joo!

876
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:35,500
You're my sapphire, my emerald,

877
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,560
and my crystal.

878
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,870
Oh, my lovely pessimist.

879
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,290
Mr. Hyeong-Gook Park

880
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,690
- So, you're a writer?
- Yes?

881
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:09,210
I'm a big reader myself,
yet I've never heard of you.

882
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:12,870
That name is my pen name.

883
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,380
Is that wrong?

884
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,180
- Isn't it a bit strange?
- Like what?

885
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:21,480
You just happened to pick
this town and this house to write?

886
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:24,780
I needed a quiet place to work,
so here I am.

887
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,580
Is that illegal?

888
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:30,990
Wouldn't you find a quiet place
in a temple or by the beach?

889
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,590
Fine then.

890
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:34,890
Help me understand how a grown man
rents a room for a short-term

891
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:38,300
from a mother-daughter family
at their home?

892
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,200
What are you, the house guest?

893
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:44,170
You have ulterior motive
for being here, right?

894
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,570
Have you nothing to say?

895
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:51,070
Must I say it out loud?

896
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:54,880
The two of you!
You don't look good together.

897
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:01,780
I'm asking you, man to man.
Let go of Yeon-Joo.

898
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,400
I want to let go of her, too.

899
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,990
- Let's go.
- What?

900
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,700
Come on, to have sex.

901
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,180
Yeon-Joo. Just hear me out.

902
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,370
There's been a misunderstanding.

903
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:02,880
Let me explain.

904
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,980
Come on. Don't do this.

905
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:11,930
This is not what I wanted.

906
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,190
No...

907
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,990
There's no misunderstanding.

908
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,690
I've been thinking.

909
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:26,780
What great romance could
a widow like me dream of?

910
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:32,180
Just sex every now and then.

911
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:36,480
Isn't that right? At our age?

912
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,980
How old are you, sir?

913
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,080
What do you need my age for?

914
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,100
I'm 43, actual age.

915
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:57,270
What have you been doing
with your life?

916
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,780
You googled me.
Is it what this is about?

917
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:03,570
Are these black spots on your hand?

918
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,980
Leave it alone.

919
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:10,880
- Did you dye your hair?
- You're hurting me.

920
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:14,890
Seriously, how old are you?
45? 47?

921
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,190
- Fifty?
- What?

922
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,690
Oh my... you're over 50?

923
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,700
Come on. I'm not even 50!

924
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:24,100
Holy crap!

925
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:28,400
How'd I end up with an old gigolo?

926
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:31,870
Old gigolo... what?

927
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,170
Yeon-Joo!

928
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,870
December 3, 1967...

929
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:40,680
why am I telling her
my Date of Birth?

930
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,950
You're certain the Blue Dragon Tea Cup
is in that house?

931
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,790
I'm sure of it.

932
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,650
All I need is a day or two.

933
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,390
Come on. Help me out here.

934
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,990
I want to get
the hell out of here, too!

935
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,370
Yeon-Joo. Just talk to me.

936
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:17,180
Regardless, you should go to work.

937
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,590
Times like this,
you need to move your body.

938
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:23,090
Are you doing this because of me?

939
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,290
No, it's not you.

940
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,690
It's because of me.

941
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,600
You know I...

942
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,300
You know how I've got problems.

943
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:36,310
No, it's all my fault.

944
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:39,370
- I think it's come back.
- No, it's all my fault, okay?

945
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,880
You should go to work, though.

946
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:44,480
Don't say anything.

947
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:47,780
I'm not going to school!

948
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,180
Fine. Do whatever you want!

949
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:58,490
No, Yeon-Joo.
She has to go to school.

950
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,290
Go, go to school.
Hey, you. Hey!

951
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,290
No, no, no.

952
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:07,000
It's not like that.

953
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:09,400
And I'm not a bad guy, okay?

954
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:15,080
You have to go to school,
and be a better person.

955
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,980
Come on, Yeon-Joo.

956
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:23,680
You have to send her to school!

957
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:30,330
Can we just forget
about the two of us?

958
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:39,100
Honestly, being with you
makes me feel really old.

959
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:40,800
It drives me crazy.

960
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:45,970
Stop!
Enough with that old talk!

961
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,570
Why am I old? I'm not!

962
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:51,880
This place is just crap!

963
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:56,880
Don't go to school.
Quit! Go make money!

964
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:59,390
Crappy family, damn you!

965
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,080
Sit down.

966
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,190
I had a hard time getting your number.

967
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,890
No one in your class knows
your number.

968
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:45,790
I don't give my number out.

969
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:49,300
Did you know who I am?

970
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:52,670
Of course, I know you.
You always stare at me.

971
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,870
I'm kidding.

972
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:59,470
I saw your pictures on the Internet.

973
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:01,880
- You were the "Got Milk?" girl?
- Yes.

974
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:03,780
I used to have such a crush on you.

975
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:07,780
I told my mom
I wanted to marry you.

976
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,300
You like me, don't you?

977
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:15,790
What?

978
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,090
Yeah, yes.

979
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:22,100
- Why?
- Just...

980
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,200
Because I'm good looking?

981
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:30,180
- Yeah, you're handsome.
- I know.

982
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:32,480
Um, okay.

983
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,080
Here, a present!

984
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,680
For me?

985
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,490
Try it on.

986
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:51,600
Let me help you.

987
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:57,160
- No, don't.
- Don't move.

988
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,470
- Hey, stop.
- Hold still.

989
01:21:58,540 --> 01:21:59,170
I don't want to!

990
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,770
You used to wear this outfit.

991
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,310
Stop it!

992
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:03,140
- You're the "Got Milk?" girl!
- I said STOP!

993
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,770
- Stand still!
- No!

994
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,580
Hey, what are you guys doing?

995
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:10,480
We're just talking.

996
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:12,280
What'd you say?

997
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:16,290
Hey, who's hiding back there?

998
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:20,300
Come out! All of you, go home,
before I call your teachers.

999
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,490
You should be studying!
I'll come check on you.

1000
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:28,600
This is going to be blow up
the Internet.

1001
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:31,570
Forget it. It's no fun.

1002
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,870
Sir, Mr. Song has to go.

1003
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,280
What else am I supposed to do?

1004
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:37,970
I have to report
to my father in 2 days!

1005
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:40,980
Like Mr. Ghang said, what if things
go wrong with the thugs? What then?

1006
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:44,380
I won't ask you to take responsibility,
so don't you worry.

1007
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:48,990
Mr. Song!

1008
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,400
Good morning, sir.

1009
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,090
Can you round them up?

1010
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,090
I should have listened to you.
I should have gotten rid of them.

1011
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:04,400
What are you talking about?

1012
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:05,870
They already know your face.

1013
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:10,070
I'm about to lose it. That bitch!

1014
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:12,380
Get it together
and stop drinking!

1015
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,590
Who are you?

1016
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,180
Hello, old man?

1017
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:25,890
Take it easy.

1018
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,670
You know what I don't get...

1019
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:43,880
Why you're doing this to me.

1020
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:50,580
If you keep this up,
the deal's off.

1021
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,480
What deal?

1022
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,480
Hey, Mr. Ghang.

1023
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,590
If you took the payment in advance,
shouldn't you deliver?

1024
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:05,690
Money or not, if you want to live,
bring it to me by tomorrow morning.

1025
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:07,900
What payment are you talking about?

1026
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,730
What payment?

1027
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:11,770
Is 50K not money enough for you?

1028
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,870
Do you think all rich boys just hang out
with millions in their pockets?

1029
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:22,480
Sir, let me handle it from here.

1030
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,990
Koreans have a twisted prejudice
against corporate heirs.

1031
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,190
If I hadn't met you,

1032
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:37,890
I'd still be having
those wrong ideas.

1033
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,390
Hey, you're wearing heels.

1034
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:14,930
I thought you looked taller.

1035
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Shut up, you bastard.

1036
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,280
High heels do hurt, I see.

1037
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:25,370
He's getting away!

1038
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,970
Get him!

1039
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,070
Hold it!

1040
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:29,680
Stop right there!

1041
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,090
Do you see that, kids?

1042
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:42,190
That's what our Mr. Ghang's been
emphasizing, security camera.

1043
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:46,170
We cannot cross this line,
understand?

1044
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,290
Yes, sir!

1045
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:53,670
You got until tomorrow.
No point in running.

1046
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:58,400
Catching a loud-mouth,
old rat in this country...

1047
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,970
easy as pie.

1048
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:40,580
Where is it?
Where did you hide it?

1049
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,100
What are you doing?

1050
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:26,490
I'm trying to kill myself.

1051
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,380
You can't die like that.

1052
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,680
Then how can I die?

1053
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:41,070
What have you got to die for
at your age?

1054
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,090
Because life is hard.

1055
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:00,900
Here, drink up.

1056
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:06,970
Now, tell me.
Why did you do that?

1057
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,570
Because I am ugly.

1058
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,780
Really, that's it?

1059
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:18,880
Take off those glasses.

1060
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,580
Why?

1061
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,080
Just do it.

1062
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:26,290
Come here.

1063
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,590
Let me see.

1064
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:44,370
I see.
The glasses are great for you.

1065
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:50,280
They cover up your flaws well.

1066
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,180
I was just trying to hide
bags under my eyes.

1067
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:57,790
You shouldn't be thinking about
killing yourself over nothing.

1068
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:05,790
There's a Japanese writer,
Murakami Ryu said this once.

1069
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:07,700
Sex over suicide...

1070
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm only in middle school.

1071
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:18,480
Cheers.

1072
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:30,280
Confess my love.
Don't confess.

1073
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:33,990
Confess. Don't confess...

1074
01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:54,280
Go, Mr. Song. Go!

1075
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:57,970
What is it?

1076
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:04,380
Mom

1077
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:05,280
Come over here.

1078
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,880
What did he do to you?

1079
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,980
Hey, Yeon-Joo

1080
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,690
What'd you do to my daughter?

1081
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,590
What the...

1082
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:24,370
Ugh, my back.

1083
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,470
No, Yeon-Joo.
Don't get me wrong.

1084
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:27,770
What are you doing, mom?

1085
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,580
No, it's not like that.
You got it wrong.

1086
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,480
Open up!

1087
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,880
- You're wrong.
- You're hurting me.

1088
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,990
You're giving me a hard time.
You're wrong.

1089
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,090
Ugh, my back.

1090
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:52,490
Listen, there's a misunderstanding.

1091
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:54,400
Let me explain.

1092
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:57,000
I'm calling the cops.
You can explain it to them.

1093
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:58,170
Why are you calling the cops?

1094
01:31:58,840 --> 01:31:59,670
Why not?

1095
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,180
- Don't call the cops.
- Why not?

1096
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,470
- Just don't!
- Why?

1097
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:05,780
Don't, don't. Just don't!

1098
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:12,880
Friggin... argh!

1099
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:18,790
How could you do that
to a little girl?

1100
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:19,890
- Do what?
- It's not like that, mom.

1101
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,790
You just stand back.

1102
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:24,300
Hey, you're a real piece of work.

1103
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:27,000
Your kid is having
a life or death situation,

1104
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:29,700
Yet, here you are passed out drunk.

1105
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:33,070
And what do you do?
Wrongfully accuse me?

1106
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:37,170
What do you mean she was dying?

1107
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:41,580
She tried to kill herself.
You daughter, Seong-Hwa. Okay?

1108
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:43,590
It's not Seong-Hwa.
It's Seong-Ah!

1109
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,790
Why would you want to kill youself?

1110
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:54,090
What is he talking about?
Tell me he's lying.

1111
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:57,100
Why do you care if I live or die?

1112
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:00,500
You already wish I were never born.

1113
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:05,870
How could you tell her that?

1114
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,170
You did.

1115
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,370
When you got drunk
and had a fight with dad!

1116
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:15,280
Come on, Seong-Ah.
You know I'm not well.

1117
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:18,290
What are you,
blame it on the depression?

1118
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:22,980
Do you know
why you're depressed?

1119
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,890
It's because your body
isn't busy enough.

1120
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,690
Women today don't do anything.

1121
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:35,400
Your depression could be cured
by working out every morning.

1122
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:36,500
Don't get smart with me.

1123
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:39,170
Really, I'm sick of your family.

1124
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:43,870
Your husband, Gi-Soo Hahm.

1125
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,080
Didn't he kill himself too?

1126
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:50,980
He didn't want to live with you.

1127
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:53,280
So, he fell off the roof.

1128
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,880
Good job, Gi-Soo Hahm.

1129
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,320
How'd you know?

1130
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,190
What?

1131
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,700
That my husband fell to death.

1132
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:08,000
You told me.

1133
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:09,800
No, I didn't.

1134
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:13,370
How'd you know his name?

1135
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:17,380
You.

1136
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:22,370
You killed my husband.

1137
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:25,390
No, no!

1138
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:27,680
I didn't do it.

1139
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,390
Come on, just hear me out.
Stay still.

1140
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,980
You're hurting your kid...

1141
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:32,890
- Go away.
- I will explain everything.

1142
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,400
Stop throwing things.

1143
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:38,090
Calm down.
I will explain everything.

1144
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:41,400
Don't! I am sick!

1145
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:42,700
What are you doing in my house?

1146
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:44,470
Stop throwing things.

1147
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:47,870
Look at me. I'm hurting right now.
Let me explain.

1148
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:50,470
Why am I here?

1149
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:51,980
Well, because I am a writer.
I'm here to write.

1150
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:54,380
You must have a reason
for coming here!

1151
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,580
You really want to hear it out?

1152
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:03,250
Okay, do you know of
the Blue Dragon Tea Cup?

1153
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:04,790
It's a tea cup this small.

1154
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,790
I don't know
what you're talking about...

1155
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,390
I think you do.

1156
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,990
Don't Don't!

1157
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:12,500
- Well...
- Don't.

1158
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:13,590
Get the hell out of my house.

1159
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:17,260
Your husband told me.
He hid it in this house somewhere.

1160
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:18,970
As soon as I get my hands on it,

1161
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,070
I will leave your house,
even if you tell me not to.

1162
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:25,880
I really don't know anything about it.

1163
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:28,680
It's 2 million dollars. Two!

1164
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:31,380
Mom, let's find it.

1165
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:33,890
With that money,
the store will be okay.

1166
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:35,980
The mortgage will be paid for, too.

1167
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:38,580
And I can afford my cosmetic surgery.

1168
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:42,090
Nothing to lose, mom.

1169
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:52,870
Yes, we're keeping on eye on him.

1170
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,380
Over there, get him!

1171
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:16,390
Get in, you idiots!

1172
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:31,870
Get closer. Come on!

1173
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:38,480
Hurry!

1174
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:21,890
Turn around!

1175
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,470
Hey you!

1176
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:17,980
You jerk!

1177
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:23,990
Let go of me!

1178
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:27,090
Let go of me. Let go!

1179
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:33,200
Hey hey! Get in!

1180
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,300
Come back here, punk!

1181
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,480
So this is the Blue Dragon Tea Cup?

1182
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:48,280
Can we repair it?

1183
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:49,080
No, we can't.

1184
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:53,090
Can we get something
similar looking?

1185
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,590
We can't get something like this.

1186
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:58,390
It will have to be of a certain class
to look like a $10 million piece.

1187
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,200
I believe Mr. Song
took the company car out.

1188
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:06,200
What about it?

1189
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:10,970
We have dozens of eye witnesses
and a security camera.

1190
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:13,470
Security camera.

1191
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:16,610
What shall we do now?

1192
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,480
You know I'm frigid.

1193
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:19,570
Mr. Cho!

1194
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:22,980
Well, we can report a stolen vehicle

1195
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:25,080
and make sure Mr. Song
doesn't come near the company.

1196
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:26,680
Can't get too wrong from here.

1197
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,690
Okay, then don't let him near here.

1198
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:34,890
Then you told me not to let
Mr. Song come to work.

1199
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,690
Mr. Song, Mr. Schmong.

1200
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:39,100
I need to figure out
what to report to my father.

1201
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:40,800
Can we draw up some paper work?

1202
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,390
You mean, fix the book?

1203
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:45,070
Yeah, let's give accounting
100~200 grand and go from there.

1204
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,570
Then, let me fire Mr. Song first,

1205
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:51,480
and I'll look into accounting.

1206
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:58,180
Is there really no way
to repair this?

1207
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:09,800
Now, no one will be interested
in your house.

1208
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:12,800
No matter how long it takes,
go through every inch of your place.

1209
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:17,870
I'm going into hiding for a while.
Call me as soon as you find it.

1210
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:22,480
Go into hiding, why?

1211
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:25,270
Do I really have
to explain that to you?

1212
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:26,970
Don't yell at me!

1213
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:29,480
Walk me through it, step by step.

1214
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,490
Okay, missus.

1215
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:43,590
I have to hide out,

1216
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:45,690
because I am wanted.

1217
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:48,400
Does that make sense, missus?

1218
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:52,270
Pull yourself together.
It's 2 million we're talking here.

1219
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:55,570
Without me, you can't even sell this.

1220
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:59,170
Don't let others take it
away from you.

1221
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,270
Stay focused!

1222
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:05,880
I'll be going now.

1223
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,090
Hey

1224
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,590
What about my car?

1225
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:19,900
Seriously,
you're worried about your car?

1226
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:24,960
You really annoy me, you know that?

1227
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:05,380
He was transferred to holdings,
yesterday.

1228
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:08,910
So he wasn't really a writer?

1229
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:11,680
He was a cultural property smuggler.
With a long list of priors.

1230
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:15,680
I know I called you
out of suspicion,

1231
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,990
But I never thought...

1232
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,500
- What if he...
- Don't you worry.

1233
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,000
He's going to think
he got real unlucky and got caught.

1234
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:27,190
He will never suspect you
for turning him in.

1235
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:29,900
I did some thinking myself.

1236
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:33,970
Thank you for everything.

1237
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:36,770
Could I have a cup of coffee?

1238
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:38,780
We don't drink coffee.

1239
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:40,180
Oh, Okay.

1240
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:51,680
Did he say anything else?

1241
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,190
Like what?

1242
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:57,190
It's nothing. Never mind.

1243
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:05,760
You want us to do all of this?

1244
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,570
What are you saying?

1245
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,380
All of these are ours.
Your dads, okay?

1246
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,870
Come on. Give me a hand.

1247
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:50,580
It's cold.

1248
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:22,910
Seong-Ah, don't come out.

1249
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,670
I was a gentleman to you two.

1250
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:54,970
Out of respect to your husband,
I offered to split it 50:50.

1251
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,070
I'm really sorry.

1252
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:58,170
By the way, you must know,

1253
01:45:58,950 --> 01:46:01,180
There are security cameras everywhere.

1254
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,680
You were filmed on your way in,

1255
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:07,090
down the hallway, in the elevator.

1256
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:08,180
Do you think I care?

1257
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:16,100
Those few minutes on your security feed
isn't going to stop me.

1258
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:24,570
Nice digs!

1259
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:29,280
You got here.

1260
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:36,580
2 million, my ass.

1261
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:39,080
I got exactly 200 grand.

1262
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,080
I know you have a million left,

1263
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:45,780
So don't even think about it.

1264
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:14,690
What's wrong?
When did this begin?

1265
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,290
I haven't been able to sleep.

1266
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:24,600
I haven't slept all week.

1267
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:29,200
I think I'll be fine if I can sleep,

1268
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:33,570
But I feel awful.

1269
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,770
My life sucks.

1270
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,980
I know how you feel.

1271
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:59,700
Do you sleep alright now?

1272
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:04,060
Yes, I sleep just fine.

1273
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,270
I don't even take pills anymore.

1274
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:14,580
Bitch, you got better alone.

1275
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:18,680
Can I get a drink?

1276
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:21,080
I quit drinking.

1277
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:26,490
Not fair. Really, not funny.

1278
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,700
I'm doing okay for now,

1279
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:34,190
But who knows?

1280
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:40,170
I'm sorry for hitting you earlier.

1281
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44,380
We can call it even
on the china price.

1282
01:48:45,850 --> 01:48:47,970
What china price are we even on?

1283
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:51,580
Look at you, so coy.

1284
01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:54,890
As soon as the bank opens
tomorrow morning,

1285
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,080
we're going together
to get my money.

1286
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:08,500
I'm going to lie down here.

1287
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:16,870
I can't move an inch.

1288
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:27,580
Are you hungry?
What do you want?

1289
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:33,390
Your surgery went well, huh?

1290
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:36,200
Not really.

1291
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:38,820
It's going to be fine,
once it settles in.

1292
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,200
It's all settled in already.

1293
01:49:45,770 --> 01:49:50,800
Well, the sun will
come out again some day.

1294
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,680
It's just life.

1295
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:26,070
Warm milk will help you
fall asleep.

1296
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:29,880
Damn, I had just fallen asleep.

1297
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,590
Man, it's loud in here.

1298
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:53,870
So, is he going to
move in with us now?

1299
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:55,270
What?

1300
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,880
You know,
we have to split it in half,

1301
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,280
And we don't have a room to spare.

1302
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:07,280
Why don't you let me
worry about that, alright?

1303
