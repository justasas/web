1
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:24,622
<i>The black widow, deadliest of all spiders...</i>

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:30,129
<i>earned its dark title through its
deplorable practice of devouring its mate.</i>

3
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,134
- I hope you find your mother better, honey.
- Thank you, darling.

4
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,179
- Take good care of yourself.
- I'll be all right.

5
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,908
And you stay just as long as you
think she needs you, understand?

6
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,916
I will.

7
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,418
- Oh, did you get another bottle of vitamins?
- Yeah, I got 'em.

8
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,455
And don't forget about Lottie's party.

9
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,683
Oh, I'm not going to that shambles.

10
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,691
Now, Peter, just a minute.

11
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,159
I'd just as soon go to a
party in an insane asylum.

12
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,163
But that's not the point, darling.

13
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,859
She's the star of your show. You
simply can't treat her like that.

14
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,527
All right, then let her give better parties.

15
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,037
What do you want to do, hurt
her feelings all over again?

16
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,699
- Don't you think you better get on that plane?
- Never mind the plane.

17
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,800
I want you to promise me you'll at
least make an appearance at that party.

18
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,903
With Brian and Lottie living
practically on top of us...

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,414
why, I don't want to get
into a feud with her again.

20
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,111
- But those people she invites.
- Just for a few minutes anyway.

21
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,450
Okay, okay. I'll drop in
for a minute or two anyway.

22
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,582
That's all that I ask. Just long
enough for her to see that you're there.

23
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,320
If she'll look fast enough.

24
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,328
I'll call you by 12:00.

25
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,229
Never fear. I'll be home long before that.

26
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>And so I went to Lottie's party.</i>

27
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,762
Oh, no, you don't.

28
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,230
You're not going to leave
me in there all by myself.

29
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,702
Where on earth did you and
Lottie meet all these people?

30
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,714
Who's met 'em? Bring Mr.
Denver a drink, will you?

31
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,650
- Yes, sir.
- Yours is the first face I've recognized here tonight.

32
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,586
- Well, where's Lottie?
- Oh, she's around someplace...

33
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:46,455
worming her way into someone's
heart, as usual, I should imagine.

34
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,960
Hello.

35
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,623
Oh, darling! I'm so glad you could come.

36
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,429
There's something I've been
wanting to tell you for ages.

37
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,526
Your husband is, without a doubt...

38
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,868
the worst dramatic critic in New York.

39
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,873
For one thing-

40
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,955
Oh, thank you.

41
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,082
What did Iris do, break her own leg?

42
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,092
No, I just put her on a plane.

43
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,094
Her mother's sick again.

44
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,426
Would you like to go out on the terrace?

45
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,365
Good heavens. You're not
thinking of jumping, are you?

46
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,834
But you don't mind my
being this frank, do you?

47
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,201
I couldn't be more interested, Miss Marin.

48
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,605
Except my husband isn't a critic.

49
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,610
How sweet of you to agree with me.

50
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,170
No, I mean I'm afraid you've got
me mixed up with somebody else.

51
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:46,275
My husband is Franklin Walsh, the banker.

52
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,844
Banker? Well, then what are
you doing in that hideous hat?

53
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,711
Would you mind saying
just a word or two to me?

54
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,839
On what subject?

55
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,582
I don't think it really matters.

56
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,644
It's just that my mother always told me...

57
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,156
that if a girl could be at
a party for 30 minutes...

58
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,920
without getting a man to talk to her...

59
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,724
she might just as well go
on home and shoot herself.

60
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,856
I've already been here 25.

61
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,431
Well, in that case, I'll be
very happy to save your life.

62
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,269
- You a friend of Lottie's?
- No, I don't even know her.

63
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,778
That's a funny thing about New York.

64
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,279
Sometimes you meet the
hostess at a party like this...

65
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,373
and sometimes you don't.

66
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,113
I came to this one with another
girl, but she's disappeared.

67
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,884
And everybody else here is so important.

68
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,892
- Are you?
- Not very.

69
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,554
May I ask your name?

70
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,893
- Peter Denver. What's yours?
- Oh, dear.

71
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,297
- What?
- You're important too.

72
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,962
- What's your name?
- Nancy Ordway.

73
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,904
- Actress?
- No, I'm a writer.

74
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,339
At least I'm trying to be.

75
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,537
I haven't had anything published
yet, but I'm still at it.

76
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,739
How old are you?

77
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,805
Nineteen.

78
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,374
No, that's not true. I'm 20.

79
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,920
I just hate to admit it.

80
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,479
'Cause in your 20s you ought
to have accomplished something.

81
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,491
I know.

82
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,221
Mozart had written an
opera by the time he was 12.

83
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,229
You know what I mean.

84
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,390
You ought to have shown
some talent of some kind.

85
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,627
- Don't you think?
- And you haven't?

86
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,034
Well, not yet apparently.

87
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,600
My last story-

88
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,371
Well, the editor said it was all
right to write like Somerset Maugham...

89
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,606
and it was all right to
write like Truman Capote...

90
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,114
but not at the same time.

91
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,243
Why don't you do like everybody
else and write like Hemingway?

92
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,480
I tried.

93
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,485
- Wouldn't you like a drink?
- No, I don't drink, thank you.

94
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,154
I used to, but I broke myself.

95
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,721
- But if it wouldn't be troubling
you too much- - What would you like?

96
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,928
I'm terribly hungry. Do you think
there's anything here to eat?

97
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:22,464
Well, I think I saw a tray of rather
revolting little lumps on toothpicks here.

98
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,533
Yes. Just a minute.

99
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,783
- Good night, Miss Marin.
- Oh, and do give my love to dear Benjamin.

100
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,944
- Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin?

101
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,988
That's not possible.

102
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,216
What are you doing after this?

103
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,555
Just go on home, I suppose.

104
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,356
Well, could I persuade you
to have dinner with me first?

105
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,865
What about your wife?

106
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,993
- She's out of town for a while.
- Oh.

107
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,401
And you don't have to
read the line like that.

108
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,872
The invitation is for dinner only.

109
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,433
I'm sorry. You're very much
in love with her, aren't you?

110
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,344
- Very much.
- I know.

111
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,882
How do you know?

112
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,215
How could I not know? It's a famous marriage.

113
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,653
Famous Broadway producer, a famous actress.

114
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,782
Even in Savannah people know that.

115
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,850
So all right then. What do you say?

116
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,232
I'd like very much to have dinner with you.

117
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,132
Okay, then let's go.

118
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,602
- Darling, how wonderful to see you
without your wife. - Yes. We've been-

119
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,235
Oh, Peter, you poor thing.
I've neglected you shamefully.

120
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,302
Who is this?

121
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,144
- One of your guests,
darling. Miss Nancy- - Ordway.

122
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,150
Your hostess, Miss Carlotta Marin.

123
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,448
- How do you do, Miss Marin?
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry, pet...

124
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,422
but there are always so many people
at my parties that I didn't invite...

125
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,788
that I rarely get a chance
to speak to my guests.

126
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,761
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid
I'm one of the ones you didn't invite.

127
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,856
Oh, really? Then let us say
there are always so many guests...

128
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,959
that I rarely get a chance to
speak to those I didn't invite.

129
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,528
- Where are you taking her?
- Out to dinner.

130
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,706
After which we're going to
say good night to each other.

131
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,711
And at 12:00 when Iris calls...

132
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,077
I'm gonna tell her all about it myself...

133
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,379
thus saving you the trouble, sweetie.

134
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,385
Good night. Come on, Miss, uh-

135
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,614
Ordway. Good night, Miss Marin.

136
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,586
And I never said a mumbling word.

137
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,531
Yeah, I went. That's the trouble
living in the same building with Lottie.

138
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,532
You can't very well get out of her parties.

139
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,569
- How long did you stay?
- Not long.

140
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,901
I took a kid I met there out to dinner.

141
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,907
She's about 20, I guess...

142
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,944
so if you hear I'm running around with
moppets while you're away, that's right.

143
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,945
Did she get the job?

144
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,004
No, that's the funny part about it.

145
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,016
She's not an actress. She's a writer.

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,518
Matter of fact, she didn't seem
that much interested in the theater.

147
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,988
- You want to bet?
- No, I guess not.

148
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,048
Just wait until the next time you see her.

149
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,958
You'll find out how uninterested
in the theater she is.

150
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,997
Except there ain't gonna be no
next time. This baby eats too much.

151
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,863
Do you know what that kid
got away with for dinner?

152
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,869
A whole mess of marinated herring...

153
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,405
two big bowls of pea soup...

154
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,907
steak about the size of a doormat...

155
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,206
four vegetables and some tomatoes...

156
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,337
a bucket of salad...

157
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,576
some cheese and a chocolate nut sundae.

158
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,584
No coffee.

159
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,389
<i>Lottie's party and my
meeting with Nancy Ordway...</i>

160
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,658
<i>was on the sixth ofJune.</i>

161
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,758
<i>Let us now go back exactly three months...</i>

162
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,030
<i>to the sixth of March...</i>

163
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:42,336
<i>which, as we learned later, was
when Miss Ordway arrived in New York.</i>

164
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,273
Yes?

165
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,935
Don't you really recognize me?

166
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,275
Well, Nanny. Good heavens. Come in.

167
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,372
Here, let me.

168
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,147
No wonder. You've grown so.

169
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,153
Even if I had been expecting you...

170
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,485
I wouldn't have looked for
a beautiful young woman.

171
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,458
- Well, how old are you now anyway?
- I'll be 20 next month.

172
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,724
You were still in pigtails
the last time I saw you.

173
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,129
<i>That was six or seven years ago.</i>

174
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,299
Yes, I suppose so. Well, come on.

175
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,931
- Take off your hat. Make yourself comfortable.
- Thanks.

176
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,237
But don't worry. I haven't
come to put up on you.

177
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,335
This is just to say hello and leave
my stuff here, if you don't mind...

178
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,573
while I look for a place of my own.

179
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,139
- I'm gonna live in New York now.
- Tired of Savannah?

180
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,914
Well, after Mama died, there was
nothing else to keep me there.

181
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,421
- I want to write, you know.
- Oh, really?

182
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,958
- This is Greenwich Village, isn't it?
- Good heavens.

183
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,256
Do kids still come to
Greenwich Village to write?

184
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,262
Well, isn't it cheap here?

185
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,821
Well, in comparison to some of the
more fashionable parts of town...

186
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,833
it is, of course.

187
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,835
Are you acting now?

188
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,098
Oh, yes. I'm in a hit too.

189
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,106
Uh-uh.

190
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,940
What's the name of it?

191
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,469
<i>Star Rising. Drama of sorts.</i>

192
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,517
- Can I get you a drink or something?
- Oh, no, thanks.

193
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,913
But I'm hungry enough to eat a bear.

194
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,982
Oh, well, I guess we can
do something about that.

195
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,492
<i>Within a week ofher arrival...</i>

196
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:49,158
<i>she was already on her way uptown.</i>

197
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,403
- Hello. Thought you'd given us up.
- Oh, I've been busy.

198
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,407
Well, it's about time.

199
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:00,000
I've been getting ready to
send out an expedition for you.

200
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,740
I've been working. This is my brotherJohn.

201
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:05,578
- This is Sylvia.
- Welcome to the joint, John.

202
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,244
- You an artist too?
- No, I'm still going to law school.

203
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,254
- I'm just here for a few days.
- Hey, Nanny.

204
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,450
Nanny, take care of Mr. and Miss
Amberly. They're old friends of mine.

205
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:17,423
Let me know if she spills
anything on you, huh?

206
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:21,192
She's crazy. I spilled one drink
the first day I worked here.

207
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:24,827
To hear her tell it, you'd think I was
spilling things on people all the time.

208
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,936
- What are you, brother
and sister? - Uh-huh.

209
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,772
- Well, what are you gonna have?
- Well, for heaven's sakes.

210
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:36,871
I'm certainly glad to see somebody
else besides myself reads Conrad.

211
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:40,817
- You, uh-You like
Conrad? - I love him.

212
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:43,649
A lot of people may think
he's slow and deliberate...

213
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,986
after the way writers
move along these days...

214
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:48,116
but I like that.

215
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,252
I like to get right in
there with those people...

216
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:53,058
and find out what they're
thinking and feeling.

217
00:13:57,035 --> 00:14:00,129
- What did you say you wanted?
- I want a Bloody Mary.

218
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:02,400
Well, what on earth is that?

219
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,908
Vodka and tomato juice.
Haven't you ever heard of it?

220
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,376
No, and I hope I never do again.

221
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:09,572
What's yours? Same thing?

222
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,877
No, I'll just have a beer.

223
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:16,309
- Did you ever hear of a Bloody Mary?
- Certainly.

224
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,414
It's slop, but if that's what
she wants, get it for her.

225
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,425
Well, it's her funeral.

226
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,861
- Where did you get her?
- Oh, friend of mine-

227
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,125
a fella I used to work
with in a stock company-

228
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:30,133
brought her out here a couple weeks ago...

229
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:32,135
and asked if I could give her a job.

230
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:35,036
She's his niece. What did she do,
give you some kind of an argument?

231
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:37,631
Not at all. Just kind
of natural and friendly.

232
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,502
She's cute too.

233
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:45,605
<i>Her next stop, two weeks later...</i>

234
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,913
<i>was 24th Street...</i>

235
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:51,183
<i>at the kind invitation of a new friend.</i>

236
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,851
<i>- Nanny.
- Yes?</i>

237
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:03,425
It's John.

238
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:06,368
He's flying down this afternoon
and wants to take us to dinner.

239
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,372
What about you?

240
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,408
It'll be all right, I suppose.

241
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,841
I was going to work, but-

242
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,244
- Tell him I'd love to.
- She says fine.

243
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:18,339
You sure you really want me along?

244
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,384
All right, all right.

245
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,943
Come on down whenever you get in.

246
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,425
- Does this bother you too?
- What?

247
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,690
- John and me.
- Why should it?

248
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,697
I'm sure you never figured
on anything like that...

249
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,995
when you invited me to live here with you.

250
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,331
Could have happened anyway, couldn't it?

251
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,371
I suppose so, but-

252
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,398
Do you think he's really serious?

253
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:48,276
I think so. Why? Aren't you?

254
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,371
I don't know.

255
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:53,611
I mean, I don't know
whether I should be or not.

256
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:56,449
- What do you mean?
- Oh, you know.

257
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:59,684
Your family, Boston
- all that.

258
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:02,883
I can just imagine what they think of me.

259
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,895
What's that got to do with it?

260
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,397
For one thing, they're
not as stuffy as all that.

261
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,400
For another, the only important
thing in a case like this...

262
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:13,596
is do you love him and does he love you?

263
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:19,072
Well, I'll tell you anyway.

264
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,271
I'm crazy about him.

265
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:24,747
I think he's the kindest, gentlest...

266
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:29,014
most understanding person I've
ever known in my whole life.

267
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:34,688
<i>By early May, about a month
before Lottie's cocktail party...</i>

268
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,923
<i>she had reached 45th Street and the
theater where Lottie was starring...</i>

269
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:41,864
<i>in my production of Star Rising.</i>

270
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,078
Excuse me. Which way to the stage entrance?

271
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:56,807
First alley around the corner.

272
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,390
- I'd like to see Mr. Ling, please.
- Mr. Ling is gone already.

273
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,902
Oh, dear. Did he say where he was going?

274
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:23,065
- May I ask your name?
- I'm his niece, Miss Ordway.

275
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,075
Was he expecting you?

276
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:28,806
No, I just took a chance I could have
dinner with him. Do you know where he eats?

277
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,644
- Good evening, Mr. Denver.
- Hiya, Fritz. How are all your ails?

278
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:33,650
Oh, just about the same, thank you, sir.

279
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,652
- Maybe my hips- -
Miss Marin still here?

280
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,711
- Yes, sir.
- Ah. Just the fellow I was looking for.

281
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,723
What about you and Iris for dinner with me?

282
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,725
Can't tonight. We're
booked. What's with Lottie?

283
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,727
She's eating with Alec Waterhouse.

284
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:46,025
She's going to try and steal
that play from your wife.

285
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,497
- She can have it. Iris doesn't want it.
- Isn't it any good?

286
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:51,000
The play's all right, but
he wants to do it in London.

287
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,299
- Iris doesn't want to go to London.
- Don't tell Lottie that.

288
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,305
She's all set to hijack the poor bloke.

289
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:58,206
It might break her poor little
heart that she got it on the level.

290
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,267
I won't say a word.
Sorry about dinner, Brian.

291
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,870
Oh, that's all right. I'll find somebody.

292
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,482
Do you know where he
usually eats on matinee days?

293
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:10,214
No, I don't, but maybe Mr. Mullen does.

294
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:13,849
- Where who eats?
- Mr. Ling. This is his niece.

295
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,155
He got out so quick she missed him.

296
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:18,161
I'm sorry, I don't know.

297
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,163
Oh, well. It's not too important.

298
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,563
- Thank you both very much.
- I'll tell him you were here.

299
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,568
Thanks.

300
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,402
I didn't know Ling had any family.

301
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:35,537
I didn't either.

302
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,522
Hold it a moment. What
did he do, stand you up?

303
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:53,530
Oh, no. I just took a chance.

304
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:55,623
- He didn't know I was coming.
- I'm sure he didn't.

305
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,930
He's far too gallant to stand
anyone up, even a relative.

306
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:00,596
- You know him? -
Very well. I'm, uh-

307
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,869
Well, to be perfectly honest with
you, I'm Miss Carlotta Marin's husband.

308
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:06,409
- Really?
- I have a name of my own, of course...

309
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,707
but it seems stupid to
use it when I can get...

310
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,805
so much more attention simply
telling whose husband I am.

311
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:13,214
- I know it.
- You do?

312
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:15,878
- Brian Mullen.
- How did you know it?

313
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:17,887
From the newspapers when you got married.

314
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:20,617
Well, I've never heard of such erudition.

315
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,156
- Does it really bother you that much?
- What?

316
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:27,527
- Being married to a famous star.
- Oh, not in the least. I love it.

317
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:29,725
You've no idea how many parties I get to now.

318
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,895
- But why do you say that?
- I think it must bother you.

319
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,371
You mention it so quickly
and make such a joke of it.

320
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,467
- What are you, a psychiatrist?
- No, I'm a writer.

321
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,774
Then how do you know
whether it bothers me or not?

322
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:45,907
Well, I don't actually. I'm just
guessing. Anyway, it shouldn't.

323
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:49,384
My guess is you do all right for
yourself anyway, with or without her.

324
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,116
You mean you think I have
an identity of my own?

325
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,420
Well, I don't know, of course...

326
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,654
but that's quite a line you've got there.

327
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,254
Is your name Ling too?

328
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:03,892
No, I'm Nancy Ordway. My
mother was Gordon Ling's sister.

329
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,267
- Do you drink?
- No.

330
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,668
But I'm hungry enough to eat a bear.

331
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,972
We'll split one.

332
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,381
<i>With that background to the tragedy...</i>

333
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:25,946
<i>let me now pick up the story of
my friendship with Nancy Ordway...</i>

334
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:29,186
<i>ten days after our meeting at Lottie's party.</i>

335
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,694
Were you drunk when you did these?

336
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:35,962
<i>A little.</i>

337
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,967
They're very good.

338
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,904
Yes?

339
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,668
There's a Miss Ordway who
wishes to speak to you on two.

340
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:47,677
- What's her name?
- Ordway. Miss Nancy Ordway.

341
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,713
Oh, yes. Yes, sure.

342
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:54,616
Nancy? Uh, hold it just
a second, will you, honey?

343
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:58,314
- Uh, when can I, uh, get the others?
- Monday.

344
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:01,085
Yes. Monday'll be fine.

345
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,595
Oh, but mind, don't go on the wagon on me.

346
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:06,687
Oh, no. No.

347
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,364
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Am I interrupting something?

348
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,369
No, not a thing. How have you been?

349
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,496
I just called to tell you the good news.

350
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:16,904
I sold my first story today.

351
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,204
That's wonderful, Nancy.

352
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:21,973
How did it come out, Somerset
Maugham or Truman Capote?

353
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:25,447
Mmm. I decided not to take any chances.

354
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:28,314
I made it pure Damon
Runyon from start to finish.

355
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:31,549
Well, you couldn't have done
better, kid. He's money in the bank.

356
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:34,318
Did you get my little sketch?

357
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:38,419
Oh, yes. Yes, I certainly did.

358
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:40,487
It's, uh...

359
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:44,633
right here on my desk now.

360
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:46,693
It's, uh-

361
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:50,138
Yes, it's very cute.

362
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,268
I was hoping you might find
a chance to call me sometime.

363
00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:56,541
Well, I intended to, Nancy, but
I've just been so busy lately...

364
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,707
<i>I simply haven't had the time.</i>

365
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:01,911
<i>- Did Mrs. Denver get back?
- No, they operated on her mother yesterday...</i>

366
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:04,580
<i>so now I don't know when she'll be back.</i>

367
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:30,443
The secret of love...

368
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,813
is greater than the secret of death.

369
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,786
That's the way I'd really like to write.

370
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:48,131
That sort of mood.

371
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,963
You're not afraid you'll
be charged with frivolity?

372
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,973
I'll never be able to do it, I suppose.

373
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,304
But that's it.

374
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,867
That's the goal to try for-

375
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:04,813
death and grandeur.

376
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,381
Well, you're right, of course.
Always shoot for the moon.

377
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:17,555
In a place like this...

378
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:20,495
with such music and such a view...

379
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,592
space, beauty...

380
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,104
comfort like this...

381
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:30,197
I might come close to it.

382
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:36,442
I don't suppose you'd consider
renting it out by the day.

383
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:38,573
Just when you're not here.

384
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,583
You don't think it's a little cheerful...

385
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,745
for "The secret of love is
greater than the secret of death"?

386
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:47,484
All right, I'll change
it back to comedy then.

387
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:50,391
I'm not narrow about what I write, you know.

388
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:52,395
I'll try whatever the mood is.

389
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:57,330
I take it then you weren't very much
impressed with the play this evening.

390
00:23:57,401 --> 00:24:01,030
- Why do you say that?
- It was a little too lowbrow for you, wasn't it?

391
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,266
I didn't mind that.

392
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,639
I understand the needs of
the commercial theater...

393
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,976
but I think of everything from
the viewpoint of the writer.

394
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:14,413
That means I examine the
psychology very closely.

395
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:16,453
Oh, I see.

396
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,250
That was basically a
stupid idea in that play-

397
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:21,917
That a man could run
around with another woman...

398
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,895
and then find out suddenly that he was
really in love with his wife all the time.

399
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:28,989
It just isn't possible with genuine people.

400
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:32,593
- Is this official?
- Really, I'm not kidding, Peter.

401
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,729
When you're in love, you're in love.

402
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,739
When you stop being in love, you stop.

403
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,469
You just can't start up again,
like a stalled motorboat.

404
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:41,534
Why not?

405
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:44,046
Because you can't. That's why not.

406
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,106
You, for example.

407
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:49,846
You couldn't possibly fall out of love
with Iris and then fall back in again.

408
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,854
Nor she with you.

409
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:54,655
But she did.

410
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:56,949
What do you mean, she did?

411
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:59,015
Exactly what you said she couldn't do.

412
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,458
She fell in love with
another guy a few years ago...

413
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:03,519
and when that turned out to be a mistake...

414
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:05,565
she fell back in love with me...

415
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:07,657
just like your motorboat starting up again.

416
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:10,202
And all the time you kept
on being in love with her?

417
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,397
I did.

418
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,565
- Who was the man?
- Fella named Martin.

419
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,734
Friend of the family, of course.

420
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,744
But what does it matter who he was?

421
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,746
Did you hate him?

422
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:22,839
I think you could be safe
in assuming that this...

423
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,180
didn't leave him embedded in my heart.

424
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:29,086
Well then, that doesn't prove anything,
just because she says she loves you now.

425
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:31,090
I don't want to be personal, of course...

426
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:35,458
but psychologically speaking, I wouldn't
be so sure that you're in love with her now.

427
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:40,262
Maybe not, but I wouldn't risk
any dough on that if I were you.

428
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,961
And I wouldn't be at all sure
that if another girl came along...

429
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:45,004
just as attractive-

430
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:48,603
Oh. Hello.

431
00:25:48,675 --> 00:25:50,870
What is it? Wrong floor, or coming to see me?

432
00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:52,935
Coming to see you, of course.

433
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:54,947
Lottie, you remember Miss Ordway, don't you?

434
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:57,449
- Matter of fact, I met her at your party.
- Indeed I do.

435
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,576
You were the girl who
wasn't invited. How are you?

436
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:01,780
- Fine, thank you.
- And, uh, Mr. Mullen.

437
00:26:01,855 --> 00:26:03,948
- Of course. How are you?
- How are you?

438
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:06,618
Lottie, I'm terribly sorry, but I
have to take Miss Ordway home now.

439
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:09,992
- Would you all like to go in and wait until I come back?
- Not tonight, thanks.

440
00:26:10,063 --> 00:26:13,692
It was just a drop-in in case
you were still up... and lonely.

441
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:16,327
What do you hear from your wife Iris?

442
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:20,032
Another two, three weeks yet.

443
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:22,200
- How'd it go tonight?
- All but the last two rows.

444
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:24,266
- Good night, Miss Ordway.
- Good night.

445
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:26,539
- See you tomorrow, Brian.
- Sure.

446
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:32,418
Odd choice, if I may be so bold.

447
00:26:32,486 --> 00:26:35,387
Oh, for the love of Pete, Lottie.

448
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:08,751
<i>- Good morning, miss.
- Good morning.</i>

449
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:12,690
I'm Nancy Ordway. Did Mr.
Denver tell you I'd be here?

450
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:15,319
Yeah. He told me you were gonna write here.

451
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:17,556
Well, I'm going to try anyway.

452
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:20,122
I'll be here every day
until Mrs. Denver gets back.

453
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,431
Will I be in your way if I just
stay here in this room and write?

454
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:27,564
Oh, no. I'm generally through
here by 10:00 or 10:30.

455
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,666
I work upstairs for lunch...

456
00:27:29,743 --> 00:27:32,109
but if you want anything before I go...

457
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:34,113
you'll find me in the bedroom or the kitchen.

458
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:36,376
Thank you. Lucia, isn't it?

459
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:38,940
Yeah, that's right. Lucia.

460
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:55,892
Iris is coming in. I've
got to meet her at 6:00.

461
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:57,994
Sure, Peter. I'll look in
tomorrow, if it'll be convenient.

462
00:27:58,071 --> 00:28:00,505
Tomorrow will be fine. Did you
get in touch with Miss Ordway?

463
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:02,599
Yes. I told her Mrs. Denver
was coming back today...

464
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:05,474
- and that you'd get in touch with her in a couple of days.
- Fine.

465
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:07,479
Said she understood, and for me to thank you.

466
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,515
I'll see you tomorrow, Gordon.

467
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:17,049
Uh, did he say Miss Ordway?

468
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:19,557
Yeah. She's a young writer
he picked up somewhere.

469
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:22,595
She's been working in the
apartment for the past few weeks.

470
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:25,756
Sounds goofy to me, but you
know what a soft touch Peter is.

471
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:27,766
Why? Do you know her?

472
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:30,428
No. No, I guess not.

473
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:43,408
- Hiya, honey.
- Hiya, darling.

474
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:47,245
What about the show?

475
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,379
Holding up very well.

476
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:52,425
In fact, it looks now as if
it might run into next season.

477
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,722
Lottie behaving herself?

478
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:57,820
Well, I think I'm the only one around
the theater still speaking to her...

479
00:28:57,898 --> 00:29:00,560
but nobody's actually clobbered her yet.

480
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:04,195
- Poor Brian.
- If he doesn't like that sort of thing...

481
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:07,729
he should never have said yes.

482
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:10,275
<i>Oh, for heaven's sakes.</i>

483
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:13,335
You haven't let Lottie put on some
frightful homecoming production, have you?

484
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:16,348
No, I'm afraid we've still
got Miss Ordway with us.

485
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,441
Who's Miss Ordway?

486
00:29:18,518 --> 00:29:21,749
You remember I told you I took this
kid out to dinner the day you left?

487
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:24,984
- Oh, yes.
- Well, I've been letting her work here during the day.

488
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:27,549
She's a writer. She's supposed to be gone.

489
00:29:27,627 --> 00:29:30,027
I'll, uh
- I'll tell you about it later.

490
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:37,027
What does she do, write in the dark?

491
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:51,677
She's a nut about that piece.

492
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:54,413
She must be a nut about other things too.

493
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,856
"The secret of love is greater
than the secret of death. "

494
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:07,262
Maybe she's in the kitchen.

495
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:29,317
- She must be in the bathroom.
- I'll get her.

496
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,341
What is it?

497
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:53,643
What's the matter, honey?

498
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:21,500
Hey, what's the matter? Can't you
pull that sheet back off her face?

499
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:24,441
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

500
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:26,979
Hold it now. Hold it.

501
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,017
Thank you.

502
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:35,650
How did she happen to be
here in this apartment?

503
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:39,157
I gave her a key.

504
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:41,989
She said where she lived wasn't
very cheerful for writing...

505
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:45,088
so when she asked if she could work
here during the day, I said okay.

506
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:48,623
<i>- How long ago was that?
- Something like two weeks ago.</i>

507
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:50,931
And how long had you known her?

508
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:54,339
Two, three weeks before that.

509
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:57,433
He met herJune 6, the day
I left for New Orleans.

510
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,740
He told me about it on the phone that night.

511
00:31:59,813 --> 00:32:01,804
Where did you meet her, Mr. Denver?

512
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:05,078
- Upstairs, at a party at Carlotta Marin's.
- The actress?

513
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:07,312
That's right. She's in a show of mine.

514
00:32:07,387 --> 00:32:09,378
Was she a friend of Miss Marin's?

515
00:32:09,456 --> 00:32:11,686
No, she came to the party with another girl.

516
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:14,192
I don't know who the other
girl was. I never met her.

517
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,423
- Did you see much of her after that?
- Not a great deal, no.

518
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:20,261
We had dinner together that night
and a couple of other nights.

519
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:23,166
Now and then I'd talk to her on the phone.

520
00:32:23,236 --> 00:32:25,431
Did you know anything about her family?

521
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:28,633
All I know is that she said she
came from Savannah, Georgia...

522
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,142
and that her mother and
father were both dead.

523
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:42,310
What do you make of this?

524
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:45,584
<i>That's a quotation from the opera Salome.</i>

525
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:47,683
She was writing a story
around that theme, I believe.

526
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,694
Why the drawing? I don't know...

527
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:51,696
except that she often left
drawings like that around...

528
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:53,698
with some kind of a
facetious comment on them.

529
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,700
I don't know what to make of that one.

530
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:57,702
You think it was meant as a suicide note?

531
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,000
I suppose so, if you
want to take it that way.

532
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:02,098
- But how else could you take it?
- I don't know.

533
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:04,268
I don't know what she might have meant by it.

534
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:06,835
Well, if we take it for the
moment as a suicide note...

535
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:09,040
wouldn't that suggest something else to you?

536
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:13,351
- What?
- Wouldn't that suggest that there was something more...

537
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:15,410
than a casual relationship between you?

538
00:33:15,488 --> 00:33:17,615
I don't care what it suggests to you.

539
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,251
The fact remains that I had no
romantic interest in Miss Ordway...

540
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:24,421
nor the slightest reason to
suspect that she had any in me.

541
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:26,761
And in case there's any
doubt about it, Lieutenant...

542
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,358
I think you ought to know
that Mr. Denver and I...

543
00:33:29,435 --> 00:33:31,426
are not members of a giddy nightclub set...

544
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:34,905
who run around having casual affairs
with other members of the group.

545
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:37,204
We've been married for seven years...

546
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:39,211
and if you'll forgive an
old-fashioned expression...

547
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,247
we're still in love with each other.

548
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:44,215
I'll try and keep that in mind, Mrs. Denver.

549
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:47,342
You said there were other drawings like this.

550
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,854
- Where are they?
- I threw 'em out, I suppose.

551
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:52,619
I can't remember.

552
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:54,660
Oh, wait a minute.

553
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:57,960
Yes, here's one.

554
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:00,158
This is the first one I ever got from her.

555
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:03,225
That's how she reminded
me of her phone number.

556
00:34:05,972 --> 00:34:08,202
I'll keep this one for the time being.

557
00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:11,471
Now, if we dismiss the idea
of a romance between you...

558
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:13,774
what other motive can you
think of for what she did?

559
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:17,304
Well, she was almost unbelievably
serious about her writing.

560
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:19,578
She might have been discouraged about that.

561
00:34:19,652 --> 00:34:22,120
<i>- But why in your apartment?
- I don't know.</i>

562
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:26,090
<i>- You can't even suggest a possibility?
- No, I can't.</i>

563
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,354
Did she ever strike you as a neurotic?

564
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:30,760
Not much more than the rest of us, no.

565
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,628
- Reasonably normal?
- So she seemed to me.

566
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,362
<i>- Then if you can't think of
anything else at the moment</i>

567
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:39,269
<i>Will you stop this silly
imitation of Dragnet...</i>

568
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,603
and let me in?

569
00:34:41,674 --> 00:34:44,006
<i>Let her in.</i>

570
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:48,079
What is it, Peter?

571
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:50,945
Miss Ordway killed herself
here this afternoon.

572
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:54,282
Do you mean that child you met at my party?

573
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:56,515
That's the one.

574
00:34:56,589 --> 00:34:59,990
Oh, good heavens. Iris, you poor thing.

575
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:02,050
Well, how did she do it?

576
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:04,619
She hanged herself.

577
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:08,064
- She was insane.
- Why do you say that?

578
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:11,331
To hang herself when she could
have used pills. Who are you?

579
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:13,895
Lieutenant Bruce is a detective.

580
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:16,840
- Miss Carlotta Marin, Lieutenant.
- I recognize Miss Marin.

581
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,968
How do you do?

582
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:22,481
We won't stay, darling. I
know this is no time for that.

583
00:35:22,548 --> 00:35:25,915
- But may I say one thing to you?
- Of course.

584
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:28,283
Without knowing anything
else about the case...

585
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:30,345
I can just imagine the first thought...

586
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:34,120
that came into your mind when
you heard what had happened.

587
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:36,559
But it's not true.

588
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,961
Not possibly.

589
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:41,227
To put the kindest face possible on it...

590
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:43,769
the girl was a little horror-

591
00:35:43,836 --> 00:35:45,929
a transparent, syrupy little phony...

592
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:50,169
with about as much to offer
a man as Cuckoo the Bird Girl.

593
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:54,145
Not even Peter, with all of his
radiant innocence about women...

594
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:57,740
could have been stirred for one
instant by that dingy little creep.

595
00:35:57,817 --> 00:36:00,843
Lottie, the girl is dead.

596
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,081
I know...

597
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:06,785
and that's precisely why I
refuse to speak harshly of her.

598
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:09,589
But you and Iris are my friends...

599
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:11,653
and I refuse also to remain silent...

600
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:16,031
when a thoroughly tragic
misunderstanding is possible here.

601
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,070
Well, isn't that so, Officer?

602
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,435
I hope not, of course.

603
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:24,543
Well, then believe what I'm telling you.

604
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,068
I know exactly what's in your
mind, and it's utter nonsense.

605
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:30,138
Stick to it, and you can only wind up...

606
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:32,309
by making a public spectacle of yourself.

607
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:35,548
- Thanks for the tip, ma'am.
- And don't you worry either, darling.

608
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:37,987
I'll explain the whole thing to Iris.

609
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:40,082
Call me the minute these
people are out of here.

610
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,184
Come along, darling.

611
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:48,425
A very forceful woman.

612
00:36:51,504 --> 00:36:53,529
One more thing, Mr. Denver.

613
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:56,074
I wonder if you could tell me
where you were this afternoon...

614
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:58,110
before you went to meet Mrs. Denver.

615
00:36:58,177 --> 00:37:01,044
- I went to a movie.
- Which one?

616
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:03,878
It was an old picture at the
Star Theater on 42nd Street.

617
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,511
I'm casting a play now. There was a
Hollywood actor in it I wanted to see.

618
00:37:07,587 --> 00:37:09,885
What was the name of it?

619
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:12,618
<i>The Girl in the Window.</i>

620
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:16,059
- Anybody with you?
- No, I went alone.

621
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:18,563
Did you see anybody that
you knew, or might know you?

622
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,599
No.

623
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:23,568
Thanks.

624
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:26,104
- Good night, Mrs. Denver.
- Good night.

625
00:37:30,143 --> 00:37:32,338
<i>Come here, dear.</i>

626
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:34,346
Sit here.

627
00:37:39,986 --> 00:37:42,079
Was that the truth?

628
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:44,123
That was the truth, all right...

629
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,182
but I'm beginning to wonder
who's going to believe it.

630
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:50,589
Well, I am, for one.

631
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,739
Do you mind Mrs. Denver being here?

632
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,937
Not if you don't. Come in, Mrs. Denver.

633
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:11,003
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

634
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:14,675
We were just wondering if
you had anything to add...

635
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,685
from what you told us last night.

636
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,687
No, not that I can think of.

637
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,223
Too bad about the fuss it's
kicking up in the papers.

638
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:24,920
But that's one of the
penalties of fame, I suppose.

639
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:26,929
Send in Miss Colletti.

640
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:28,965
- Miss Colletti?
- Lucia.

641
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:31,330
- Oh, of course.
- You're on friendly terms, aren't you?

642
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:33,335
Quite. We're very fond of her.

643
00:38:33,403 --> 00:38:36,065
There's no reason to assume a
grudge or anything like that?

644
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:39,233
- No, not that I know of.
- Come in, Mrs. Colletti.

645
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:45,441
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Denver.
- That's all right. We understand, Lucia.

646
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:49,542
You're Mrs. Lucia Colletti. You work as
a part-time maid for Mr. and Mrs. Denver...

647
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,610
and also for Mr. and Mrs. Brian Mullen...

648
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:53,986
in an apartment upstairs
in the same building.

649
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:57,891
Mrs. Mullen being better
known as Miss Carlotta Marin.

650
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,259
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

651
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,094
Did you tell us last night that
Mr. Denver once gave you $10...

652
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:05,930
not to mention Miss Ordway's
presence in Mr. Denver's apartment?

653
00:39:06,002 --> 00:39:08,493
I'll answer that. I did.

654
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:11,006
But it was only not to
mention it to Miss Marin...

655
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:13,372
who is a foolish gossip and a mischief maker.

656
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,775
I didn't care to have Miss
Marin make a scandalous story...

657
00:39:15,846 --> 00:39:18,872
out of an innocent, if
possibly stupid, arrangement.

658
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:21,782
I thought you and Miss
Marin were very good friends.

659
00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:23,786
Not really.

660
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:27,255
She likes Mrs. Denver, I believe, after
her fashion, but I'm sure she loathes me.

661
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,554
For any particular reason?

662
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:31,719
I'm her employer.

663
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:36,288
How often did you see Miss
Ordway in Mr. Denver's apartment?

664
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:39,858
- Every day, sir.
- And what was she doing there?

665
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:42,234
Writing on the typewriter.

666
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:44,569
And how was she dressed?

667
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:46,575
Always, sir.

668
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:48,702
Uh, except that once.

669
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:51,474
Do you mind telling us again about that once?

670
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:55,908
Once she was asleep in the bed.

671
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:58,420
Whose bed?

672
00:39:58,488 --> 00:40:01,116
One of the beds in the bedroom.

673
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,523
What was she wearing that morning?

674
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:06,255
- Pajamas, sir.
- Whose?

675
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:11,099
- Mrs. Denver's, sir.
- Was she alone?

676
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,294
Oh, yes, sir.

677
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,101
That's all, Mrs. Colletti.
Thank you very much.

678
00:40:17,173 --> 00:40:19,607
I'm sorry, Mrs. Denver. I had to tell them.

679
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:21,906
That's all right. I understand.

680
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:29,215
So all right, she took a nap one
morning. What does that prove?

681
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:31,277
Send Miss Amberly in.

682
00:40:31,354 --> 00:40:33,447
You know who Miss Amberly is, don't you?

683
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:37,516
- No.
- She's the young lady that lived with Miss Ordway.

684
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:40,926
Mr. and Mrs. Denver, Miss Amberly.

685
00:40:40,997 --> 00:40:42,931
- Sit down, won't you?
- No, thanks.

686
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,627
You don't mind going over some of
the same ground of your story...

687
00:40:45,702 --> 00:40:47,636
as you did last night, do you?

688
00:40:47,704 --> 00:40:49,797
Not at all. Anything you want.

689
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:51,807
Well, from what Miss Ordway told you...

690
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:54,503
what was your impression of the
relationship between her and Mr. Denver?

691
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,841
It was not simply an impression.

692
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,938
Nanny told me what it was in so many words.

693
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:01,643
She was in love with him,
and he was in love with her.

694
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:04,243
- Now, just a- - Don't
interrupt, Mr. Denver.

695
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:06,585
I want you to hear what
she's got to say first.

696
00:41:06,656 --> 00:41:08,988
Then you can talk if you want to.

697
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,721
Did Miss Ordway know that
Mr. Denver was a married man?

698
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:13,854
Of course. That was the tragedy of it.

699
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,229
But you understood from her he
promised at last to divorce his wife?

700
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,394
That's what he told her, but I
warned her then he'd never do it.

701
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,563
This woman must be out of her mind.

702
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,073
I don't know whether these are
Nancy Ordway's lies or her own...

703
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:27,132
but every word she's uttered is a lie.

704
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,145
And from your talks with her, were
you able to decide for yourself...

705
00:41:30,213 --> 00:41:32,545
whether this relationship
was platonic or not?

706
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,482
It wasn't necessary for
me to decide for myself.

707
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:39,079
Nanny told me the whole
sordid story. It was not.

708
00:41:39,155 --> 00:41:42,090
<i>That's all, Miss Amberly.
Thank you very much.</i>

709
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:45,753
No. No, that is not all.
Just one minute, Miss-

710
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:49,222
But you're not gonna let
her get away with that.

711
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,233
Get away with what?

712
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,168
You just let that woman
accuse me of seducing a girl...

713
00:41:54,237 --> 00:41:57,604
make a false promise of marriage,
and then drive her to suicide...

714
00:41:57,674 --> 00:42:00,472
without giving me the slightest
opportunity to come back at her.

715
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:02,511
Now, is that what you call a fair shake?

716
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,513
But you deny it all, don't you?

717
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:08,142
Of course I deny it all, because it isn't true
- not one word of it.

718
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:10,846
Then can you offer a suggestion
why either she or Miss Ordway...

719
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,150
should make up such a
story if it weren't true?

720
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:15,851
Well, obviously, the woman is a neurotic.

721
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:18,758
I can't even understand your
listening to such a lunatic.

722
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:22,958
We have to listen to everything that has a
bearing on an unnatural death, Mr. Denver.

723
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:27,129
- That's our job.
- Is it a crime to have known a girl that killed herself?

724
00:42:27,203 --> 00:42:30,070
- No.
- Then what's the reason for all this gumshoe work...

725
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,870
dragging in all these people
to blacken me in this case?

726
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:35,410
- Oh, that was your idea.
- What do you mean?

727
00:42:35,478 --> 00:42:40,211
Suicides are almost invariably
neurotics of one kind or another...

728
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:42,877
but you insist that this
girl was quite normal.

729
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:46,388
And there was no reason for her to kill
herself because of you or in your apartment...

730
00:42:46,456 --> 00:42:49,084
so obviously we gotta look
further for the explanation.

731
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:52,128
- Is there anything else?
- Not now.

732
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,527
I'll call you if there is.

733
00:42:54,597 --> 00:42:57,395
The time of her death, in
case you're interested...

734
00:42:57,467 --> 00:43:00,436
was between 2:30 and 4:00 in the afternoon.

735
00:43:01,504 --> 00:43:03,438
Thanks.

736
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:17,613
- Do you want to go home?
- I suppose so.

737
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:19,746
Sixty-seventh and Fifth.

738
00:43:19,823 --> 00:43:22,257
- And where are you going?
- The office first.

739
00:43:22,325 --> 00:43:25,055
I'll be home around 6:00 or so.

740
00:43:44,013 --> 00:43:46,004
I don't want to be
troublesome, Miss Amberly...

741
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,050
but I've got to know something more...

742
00:43:48,118 --> 00:43:50,052
about that story you told the police.

743
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,953
I have nothing whatever to say to
you, so will you please get out?

744
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:54,956
- Mr. Denver?
- Will you make him leave, John?

745
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:58,391
- Who are you?
- I'm her brother, John Amberly. What do you want?

746
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:02,363
- I want to know why your sister lied about me this morning.
- I did not lie.

747
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:05,458
Then Miss Ordway lied to you, Miss Amberly,
if that's where you got your story...

748
00:44:05,535 --> 00:44:07,901
because there's not one word of truth in it.

749
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:09,905
Now, why do you think she did that?

750
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:12,066
- You're Peter Denver, aren't you?
- Of course.

751
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:14,667
- Husband of the celebrated Iris Denver?
- I am.

752
00:44:14,744 --> 00:44:17,440
Then she didn't lie about it.

753
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,719
Well, then will you at least tell me where
you met her, or who introduced her to you?

754
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:28,348
She was a waitress at Sylvia's
over on 17 th near Eighth Avenue.

755
00:44:28,424 --> 00:44:30,949
- What's that got to do with it?
- Where was she living then?

756
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:33,461
With some other girl. I don't know who.

757
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,158
Why do you answer him? He has
no right to ask us questions.

758
00:44:36,232 --> 00:44:39,258
Are you going to get out, or do
you want me to call the police?

759
00:44:39,335 --> 00:44:41,667
I wish you'd try to understand
my position, Miss Amberly.

760
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:45,105
No matter what she told you, I was
nothing whatever to Nancy Ordway.

761
00:44:45,175 --> 00:44:47,109
Nothing whatever.

762
00:44:47,177 --> 00:44:50,840
My life's being chewed up here without
my having the slightest idea how or why.

763
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:53,940
That's really wonderful.
Your life's being chewed up.

764
00:44:54,017 --> 00:44:57,783
And what about his? I suppose that's nothing.

765
00:44:57,854 --> 00:45:00,152
I don't know what she's talking about.

766
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:02,248
I loved her. I wanted her to marry me.

767
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,351
And she would have too,
if it hadn't been for you.

768
00:45:05,428 --> 00:45:07,362
Did she tell you that?

769
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,625
No, that's what she told my sister.

770
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:12,532
- Is that true, Miss Amberly?
- It is.

771
00:45:12,602 --> 00:45:14,536
Now I've asked you for the last time.

772
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:17,402
Are you going to get out,
or shall I call the police?

773
00:45:26,482 --> 00:45:28,473
Well, if you don't mind my saying so...

774
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:32,248
I'm very sorry for you too, Mr. Amberly.

775
00:45:37,393 --> 00:45:40,021
Oh, I'm sure there's a perfectly
innocent explanation for this.

776
00:45:40,096 --> 00:45:42,030
After all, the girl was
alone in the apartment...

777
00:45:42,098 --> 00:45:44,032
and she may very well have decided...

778
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,398
to simply sleep instead of work that morning.

779
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:50,166
Not an altogether unnatural
choice, if you ask me.

780
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,936
But what about that other woman?

781
00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:56,445
I have a confession to make to you, Iris.

782
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:59,447
I lied to that detective last night.

783
00:45:59,515 --> 00:46:02,075
I was giving Peter the benefit of the doubt.

784
00:46:02,151 --> 00:46:04,119
But after what you've heard this morning...

785
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:07,520
I see no further need
of trying to protect him.

786
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:14,062
- I've known all along about that girl.
- Have you really?

787
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,998
I saw her in and out of this
building a dozen times, day and night.

788
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:21,730
Not that I placed any evil
construction on it then...

789
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:24,739
but now I find myself quite unable...

790
00:46:24,807 --> 00:46:27,799
to continue thinking of them
as two young music lovers...

791
00:46:27,877 --> 00:46:31,677
listening steadily to the phonograph
for something like six weeks.

792
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,943
Well, I still can't believe it.

793
00:46:34,017 --> 00:46:36,645
Now, there's no one in the world
fonder of Peter than I am...

794
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:38,653
but if I were in your place-

795
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:41,690
and believe me, I say
this for your own good-

796
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,106
We, uh, just dropped in to
see if there was anything new.

797
00:46:59,175 --> 00:47:01,541
- Good of you.
- Thank you, darling.

798
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:03,579
Honey.

799
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:18,219
Now what was it you were going to
tell Iris for her own good, may I ask?

800
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,855
Can you really hear through
the keyhole of a Yale lock?

801
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:25,230
The organ tones of an
old-fashioned actress, yes.

802
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:28,896
I have no objection your knowing
what I was going to tell my friend.

803
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,737
I was going to suggest to her
that she move out of this place.

804
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,505
- Why?
- You're not that obtuse.

805
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:38,274
All right, then I'm going
to take the liberty...

806
00:47:38,348 --> 00:47:40,748
of making a suggestion to you.

807
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:44,446
From now on, would you be good enough
to keep your advice to yourself?

808
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,251
- Now, Peter, please.
- I don't see how you could take a wiser position...

809
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,554
after all that's gone on in this apartment...

810
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:52,821
- while your wife was away.
- Oh, cut that out, Lottie.

811
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:55,921
In fact, it might be just as well
if you never came in here again.

812
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,432
Look, both of you, I know
we're all upset and all that...

813
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,526
but don't let's say anything
we'll be sorry for later.

814
00:48:00,603 --> 00:48:02,537
Ever since she moved into this building...

815
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:05,233
she's been poking her nose into
my business, and I'm sick of it.

816
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:09,711
- Now get out and stay out.
- With the greatest of pleasure, Mr. Denver.

817
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:12,543
Out of here and out of your theater too.

818
00:48:12,615 --> 00:48:14,549
Oh, don't be a fool, Lottie.

819
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:16,915
We'll see who the fool
is when our young hero...

820
00:48:16,986 --> 00:48:19,853
tries to raise the curtain tomorrow night.

821
00:48:19,922 --> 00:48:22,390
Ring for the elevator, will you?

822
00:48:24,994 --> 00:48:26,962
- Don't take that too seriously, Peter.
- Oh, forget it.

823
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,156
I don't care whether she
ever plays again or not.

824
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:32,065
She doesn't mean it, really. She
just flew off the handle for a moment.

825
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:35,036
In her heart, she's for
both of you, believe me.

826
00:48:35,104 --> 00:48:37,766
Like this afternoon when that
detective was prying around upstairs-

827
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,072
<i>- not one word out of her.
- Come on, will you?</i>

828
00:48:42,145 --> 00:48:44,272
I'm coming.

829
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:49,510
You, uh, heard the girl
was pregnant, didn't you?

830
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:53,822
No, I didn't.

831
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,381
That cop told us this afternoon.

832
00:49:01,431 --> 00:49:03,422
Anything else?

833
00:49:05,034 --> 00:49:07,002
Nothing to top that.

834
00:49:40,903 --> 00:49:43,667
Think you'd like to go out for dinner?

835
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:48,467
Listen to this.

836
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:51,746
"My dear Iris.

837
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:53,873
"We've talked of you so often
and with such sympathy...

838
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,510
I'm sure you won't mind
my calling you Iris. "

839
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,577
Who's it from?

840
00:49:58,654 --> 00:50:00,918
From Nanny. Nanny Ordway.

841
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:07,220
"Nevertheless, this is not an easy
letter to write, as you can well imagine.

842
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,924
"But since Peter's already told
you what has happened to us...

843
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:14,163
I feel I must add something by way of
explaining Peter's side of the case. "

844
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:17,206
- Let me see that.
- Let me see it first, if you don't mind.

845
00:50:19,509 --> 00:50:21,568
"You must understand that
he was no more to blame...

846
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:24,010
"he had no more control over his emotions...

847
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,948
than you had when you realized
you'd lost your heart to Martin. "

848
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,488
How could you have told her that?

849
00:50:34,524 --> 00:50:36,515
But I didn't.

850
00:50:36,592 --> 00:50:39,755
Not like that, I mean. I-I
never told her one thing-

851
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,559
Oh, Peter, please. Don't talk
to me as if I were an idiot.

852
00:50:42,632 --> 00:50:45,601
- Where else would she have got the name?
- Will you let me explain?

853
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,831
What did you do, just sit here and
tell her everything about you and me?

854
00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:50,839
No, no, of course not. What she's done-

855
00:50:50,907 --> 00:50:53,307
She's taken one stupid, foolish remark...

856
00:50:53,376 --> 00:50:55,401
and built it into this impossible lie.

857
00:50:55,478 --> 00:50:57,412
Everybody's lying but you.

858
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,414
Lucia, that other woman, Nanny Ordway-

859
00:50:59,482 --> 00:51:01,746
they're all lying but you.

860
00:51:04,787 --> 00:51:07,585
But it's the truth, darling.

861
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:09,921
I swear it.

862
00:51:09,992 --> 00:51:12,517
- Please.
- What are you gonna do?

863
00:51:12,595 --> 00:51:14,620
I don't know.

864
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:18,155
Except I
- I can't stay here any longer.

865
00:51:36,516 --> 00:51:38,814
Well, she's gone.

866
00:51:38,885 --> 00:51:42,252
- Oh, no.
- Mmm. Cook just told me.

867
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:44,415
- Where'd she go?
- Who knows?

868
00:51:46,126 --> 00:51:48,060
Poor Peter.

869
00:51:48,128 --> 00:51:52,326
Yes, indeedy. My heart just bleeds for him.

870
00:51:52,399 --> 00:51:54,765
Don't you think you're
being a bit unfair to him?

871
00:51:54,834 --> 00:51:57,166
Do you think so, really?

872
00:51:57,237 --> 00:51:59,637
Well, you have no proof
of anything, have you?

873
00:51:59,706 --> 00:52:03,472
Do you think it was all right for him
to go running around with another woman?

874
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:06,376
Well, I have no reason
to think it was all wrong.

875
00:52:09,983 --> 00:52:11,917
Would you do it?

876
00:52:11,985 --> 00:52:15,318
Ah, well, that's a somewhat
different situation.

877
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:17,379
In what way?

878
00:52:17,457 --> 00:52:20,255
Because, after all, you
and I have an understanding.

879
00:52:21,661 --> 00:52:24,129
What sort of understanding, may I ask?

880
00:52:24,197 --> 00:52:27,132
You know. The understanding that if
ever you catch me with another woman...

881
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,134
you'll break my neck.

882
00:52:32,806 --> 00:52:36,139
- You object to that?
- Of course not.

883
00:52:36,209 --> 00:52:38,143
You better not.

884
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:40,611
You want me to pick you up after the show?

885
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,614
What show?

886
00:52:42,682 --> 00:52:46,243
- You weren't serious about that, were you?
- Indeed I was.

887
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,311
I'm through with Mr. Peter
Denver forever, and that's final.

888
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:53,018
But you've got a contract, darling.
You can't just walk out like that.

889
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:55,425
I can if Dr. Harstone advises it...

890
00:52:55,495 --> 00:52:58,225
for the sake of my health, can't I?

891
00:53:29,295 --> 00:53:31,229
- Oh, hello, Lieutenant.
- Mr. Mullen.

892
00:53:31,297 --> 00:53:34,130
Do you have any idea where we
might be able to find Mrs. Denver?

893
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,134
There's no answer at her apartment.

894
00:53:36,202 --> 00:53:38,136
No, I haven't seen either of them today.

895
00:53:38,204 --> 00:53:41,332
Isn't this apartment identical with theirs?

896
00:53:41,408 --> 00:53:44,275
Yes, except that we have
a terrace and they don't.

897
00:53:44,344 --> 00:53:47,142
- May I see the arrangement?
- Of course. Come in.

898
00:53:52,218 --> 00:53:54,846
- Sergeant Welch, Mr. Brian Mullen.
- How do you do?

899
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:57,048
- How do you do?
- It's just a matter of measurements...

900
00:53:57,123 --> 00:54:00,524
and if these rooms are identical, I
guess this is just as good as the other.

901
00:54:00,593 --> 00:54:03,061
- Is it all right if he goes into the bedroom?
- Of course.

902
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:06,963
The maid hasn't been in yet,
but, um, right straight through.

903
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:10,434
But don't you dare tell her I let anybody
in there before it was straightened up.

904
00:54:10,503 --> 00:54:13,404
Cops don't matter. May I
see the kitchen arrangement?

905
00:54:13,473 --> 00:54:15,464
Certainly.

906
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:24,006
It's just this dining room.
This is the breakfast room.

907
00:54:26,586 --> 00:54:28,520
And this is the kitchen.

908
00:54:28,588 --> 00:54:31,022
And it's exactly the same
in the apartment downstairs?

909
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,081
Except for the furniture.

910
00:54:34,194 --> 00:54:36,287
Is this anything?

911
00:54:36,362 --> 00:54:39,923
<i>Oh, no, that's just some doodles
my wife makes when she's phoning.</i>

912
00:54:43,903 --> 00:54:46,303
Would you answer one or two
questions strictly off the record?

913
00:54:46,372 --> 00:54:48,806
I'll try.

914
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:50,866
What do you think of Denver's story?

915
00:54:50,944 --> 00:54:52,878
I don't know. I can't figure it.

916
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:56,006
This is entirely
confidential, you understand.

917
00:54:56,082 --> 00:54:58,243
I understand.

918
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:00,252
What was his reputation about women?

919
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,414
Very good, so far as I know.

920
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,981
- No chasing?
- I've never known of any.

921
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:11,186
You think he'd be capable of murder?

922
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:15,393
Murder? Why murder?

923
00:55:18,204 --> 00:55:22,038
Look, as it turns out, the
girl didn't kill herself.

924
00:55:22,108 --> 00:55:25,100
She was murdered
- choked to death and then strung up.

925
00:55:25,178 --> 00:55:27,169
We just got the report.

926
00:55:28,648 --> 00:55:30,639
Oh, no.

927
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,316
Do you think he could have done it?

928
00:55:36,389 --> 00:55:38,323
I don't think so.

929
00:55:38,391 --> 00:55:40,552
Well, what about the evidence against him?

930
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:43,061
I just can't see Peter
doing a thing like that.

931
00:55:47,634 --> 00:55:49,568
There's nothing official
about this, you understand.

932
00:55:49,636 --> 00:55:51,570
We're just talking off the record.

933
00:55:51,638 --> 00:55:54,698
But sometimes you have a feeling about
a person that you know very well...

934
00:55:54,774 --> 00:55:57,242
that either he is capable of
killing somebody or he isn't.

935
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:01,974
It's just a feeling, but occasionally I've
found it has a definite bearing on the truth.

936
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:04,039
Is he charged with it?

937
00:56:04,117 --> 00:56:07,280
Well, we can't very well
dismiss the evidence, can we?

938
00:56:07,353 --> 00:56:09,685
This about it?

939
00:56:09,756 --> 00:56:14,318
And, uh, what if he could prove that he was
at that movie at the time the girl was killed?

940
00:56:14,394 --> 00:56:16,328
To tell you the truth, Mr. Mullen...

941
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:20,332
I've rarely met a murderer who wasn't
at a movie at the time of the murder.

942
00:56:22,001 --> 00:56:25,767
I hope you'll remember, please, that
this was strictly between ourselves.

943
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:28,671
I won't mention it, and I'd rather
you didn't, if you don't mind.

944
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:32,871
- I understand. - We're all after
the same thing, of course- the truth.

945
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:35,380
And every little bit helps, you know.

946
00:56:35,448 --> 00:56:39,179
Well, I just can't believe
it about Peter. That's all.

947
00:56:39,252 --> 00:56:41,618
- Thanks anyway.
- Glad to meet you, Mr. Marin.

948
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:44,680
- Mullen.
- Oh, that's all right. I'm used to that.

949
00:57:05,044 --> 00:57:07,911
- Yeah?
- Mr. Mullen on two.

950
00:57:11,017 --> 00:57:14,214
- Brian?
- Have you heard from the police yet?

951
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:16,346
Nothing new. Why?

952
00:57:16,422 --> 00:57:18,617
I've got some very bad news for you, Peter.

953
00:57:18,691 --> 00:57:20,682
Nanny didn't kill herself. She was murdered.

954
00:57:23,529 --> 00:57:25,463
Who said she was?

955
00:57:25,531 --> 00:57:28,557
That Detective Bruce was up
here just now and told me.

956
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:30,569
Had a report from the autopsy.

957
00:57:30,637 --> 00:57:32,867
Obviously, they're gonna
try and pin it on you.

958
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:39,908
- You mean arrest me?
- I suppose so. That's the usual routine, isn't it?

959
00:57:39,979 --> 00:57:43,073
Have you got a lawyer?

960
00:57:43,149 --> 00:57:46,141
Just a minute. Yes?

961
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:49,814
Sergeant Owens from the
police is here to see you.

962
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:54,326
Okay. Uh, just hold it a minute, will you?

963
00:58:15,982 --> 00:58:17,973
Take a glance.

964
00:58:37,937 --> 00:58:39,871
Lieutenant Bruce speaking.

965
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:42,032
Sergeant Owens, Lieutenant.

966
00:58:42,108 --> 00:58:44,702
- The so-and-so powdered
out on us. - You're kidding.

967
00:58:44,777 --> 00:58:46,802
Without even asking us what we wanted.

968
00:58:46,879 --> 00:58:49,074
- What was he wearing?
- What was the man wearing?

969
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:51,082
Dark slacks.

970
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:53,243
- Yeah.
- Light, checked sports jacket.

971
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:55,253
- Yeah.
- Gray hat.

972
00:58:55,321 --> 00:58:58,813
All cars, especially cars in
the vicinity ofTimes Square...

973
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:01,382
be on the lookout for Peter Denver.

974
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:03,759
Wanted for questioning in homicide.

975
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:07,061
Denver, about 36, 180 pounds...

976
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:10,466
wearing dark slacks, light,
checked sports jacket.

977
00:59:16,209 --> 00:59:18,143
- Hello?
- Brian?

978
00:59:18,211 --> 00:59:20,145
- We got cut off.
- Are you alone?

979
00:59:20,213 --> 00:59:23,182
- Yes.
- Well, they came for me, but I got out.

980
00:59:23,249 --> 00:59:25,342
If they lock me up now, I'm a dead duck.

981
00:59:25,418 --> 00:59:27,409
Can you stay by that phone for a while?

982
00:59:27,487 --> 00:59:29,785
Of course, but are you sure
you should have done that?

983
00:59:29,856 --> 00:59:32,518
I don't now, but it's a
cinch I'm not gonna be able...

984
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:34,787
to do anything for myself
if I'm in the Tombs.

985
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:36,988
I've got to dig into this thing while I can.

986
00:59:37,063 --> 00:59:39,088
All right. Well, what do you want me to do?

987
00:59:39,165 --> 00:59:42,931
Nothing. Just stand by in case I
need to get in touch with somebody.

988
00:59:43,002 --> 00:59:45,266
- Okay. I'll be here.
- I'll call you later.

989
01:00:07,026 --> 01:00:10,587
<i>- Who is it?
- Lieutenant Bruce, Miss Amberly.</i>

990
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:16,663
- Let me go!
- Try to scream, you're gonna get hurt. You understand?

991
01:00:16,736 --> 01:00:18,931
- Please!
- Do you understand what I said?

992
01:00:19,005 --> 01:00:21,906
- Yes.
- I don't know whether you know it or not...

993
01:00:21,974 --> 01:00:25,432
but Nancy Ordway was murdered, and
they're trying to hang it on me.

994
01:00:25,511 --> 01:00:28,537
So you can figure out for yourself
whether I mean this or not.

995
01:00:28,614 --> 01:00:30,582
- You let me go!
- Are you gonna keep quiet?

996
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,278
- You've got no right- - Are
you gonna keep quiet or not?

997
01:00:33,352 --> 01:00:36,116
- Yes.
- All right.

998
01:00:41,194 --> 01:00:43,560
But don't kid yourself.

999
01:00:43,629 --> 01:00:47,087
You make one sound, and
you're gonna be sorry for it.

1000
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:49,100
You understand that?

1001
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:55,236
Now I want you to tell me
something, and I want the truth too.

1002
01:00:55,308 --> 01:00:59,039
- When did that girl first tell you about me?
- You killed her.

1003
01:00:59,111 --> 01:01:02,137
Answer me, you idiot! When did
that girl first tell you about me?

1004
01:01:02,215 --> 01:01:04,513
- Please!
- Then answer me.

1005
01:01:06,285 --> 01:01:10,085
It was the dayJohn asked her to
marry him. She told me that night.

1006
01:01:10,156 --> 01:01:12,147
When was that? How long ago?

1007
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,727
June 2. It was on his birthday.

1008
01:01:19,398 --> 01:01:21,366
What makes you so sure of that?

1009
01:01:21,434 --> 01:01:25,234
That's when he asked her
- the day he was 21.

1010
01:01:25,304 --> 01:01:28,137
And that same night, she
told you about this other man?

1011
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:31,904
Yes. But I'd already guessed some of it.

1012
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:35,447
What had you already guessed?

1013
01:01:35,514 --> 01:01:37,539
That she was in love with somebody-

1014
01:01:37,617 --> 01:01:39,585
a married man probably.

1015
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:42,314
She was so unhappy about it.

1016
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:44,447
How long had you guessed that?

1017
01:01:44,523 --> 01:01:47,014
I don't know. Several weeks I suppose.

1018
01:01:48,761 --> 01:01:52,492
And that same night, she
told you that it was me?

1019
01:01:52,565 --> 01:01:54,556
She did.

1020
01:01:55,768 --> 01:01:57,861
What did she say exactly?

1021
01:01:57,937 --> 01:02:01,429
That you were in love. That you were married.

1022
01:02:01,507 --> 01:02:04,101
You didn't think your wife
would give you a divorce.

1023
01:02:04,176 --> 01:02:06,576
Did she tell you then that
she was gonna have a child?

1024
01:02:06,646 --> 01:02:08,580
No. Not then.

1025
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:10,616
When did she tell you that?

1026
01:02:10,683 --> 01:02:13,015
Last Tuesday-

1027
01:02:13,085 --> 01:02:15,986
the day before you killed her.

1028
01:02:16,055 --> 01:02:17,989
How long had she been pregnant?

1029
01:02:18,057 --> 01:02:20,048
I don't know. She didn't say.

1030
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:29,666
I don't know whether to
break your neck or not...

1031
01:02:29,735 --> 01:02:32,101
but you're lying to me and I know it.

1032
01:02:32,171 --> 01:02:35,265
But I'm not. I swear it, I tell you.

1033
01:02:38,077 --> 01:02:40,910
- Where's your brother?
- Back at school.

1034
01:02:47,453 --> 01:02:49,580
All right, stop worrying.

1035
01:02:49,655 --> 01:02:52,852
I'm not gonna do anything to you now.

1036
01:02:52,925 --> 01:02:55,155
But remember this.

1037
01:02:55,227 --> 01:02:57,161
If you tell the police about this...

1038
01:02:57,229 --> 01:02:59,959
I'll get you if it's
the last thing I ever do.

1039
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:04,268
That girl's got me in a box here.

1040
01:03:04,337 --> 01:03:08,034
And apparently no one's gonna
help me out of it but myself.

1041
01:03:08,107 --> 01:03:11,440
So you think twice before you
decide to do anything foolish.

1042
01:03:18,517 --> 01:03:21,543
Operator, get me the police, quick.

1043
01:03:25,091 --> 01:03:27,082
Hold it here a minute.

1044
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,034
When does this place open?

1045
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:38,468
Don't open anymore. Closed up.

1046
01:03:38,537 --> 01:03:42,564
- You mean for good?
- Yeah. The cops took up their license.

1047
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:48,041
Who do you want there?

1048
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:50,241
Well, I left a raincoat
in there the other night...

1049
01:03:50,316 --> 01:03:52,341
and I'd like to get it back if I could.

1050
01:03:52,418 --> 01:03:54,852
- You want to see Anne about that.
- Who's Anne?

1051
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,854
The checkroom girl.

1052
01:03:56,922 --> 01:03:59,413
Look, you go around there on Eighth Avenue...

1053
01:03:59,492 --> 01:04:02,859
on the west side next to the
corner, and it's a bar and grill.

1054
01:04:02,928 --> 01:04:05,522
- She's workin' there now.
- Thank you.

1055
01:04:17,476 --> 01:04:20,274
I beg your pardon. You Anne?

1056
01:04:20,346 --> 01:04:22,280
Yeah.

1057
01:04:22,348 --> 01:04:24,316
Can I talk to you alone a few minutes?

1058
01:04:24,383 --> 01:04:27,375
- What about?
- Nancy Ordway.

1059
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:29,921
- Oh, you're Peter Denver, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1060
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:32,219
I saw your picture in the paper.

1061
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:36,689
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

1062
01:04:36,762 --> 01:04:39,959
This is a fella who wants to
talk to me about Nancy Ordway.

1063
01:04:40,032 --> 01:04:42,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

1064
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:52,142
Looks like you're in quite a jam.

1065
01:04:52,211 --> 01:04:56,079
It's worse than that. Now they
say that it wasn't suicide.

1066
01:04:56,148 --> 01:04:59,447
- I could have told you that from the start.
- How?

1067
01:04:59,518 --> 01:05:02,783
Girls like that don't kill
themselves. They're too busy for that.

1068
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:06,791
- What do you mean "busy"?
- Gettin' on in the world, butterin' up to people.

1069
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:09,419
- You know what she did one night?
- Huh?

1070
01:05:09,495 --> 01:05:11,429
Humphrey Bogart came in the place.

1071
01:05:11,497 --> 01:05:14,762
She gave me two bucks to let
her help him put his coat on.

1072
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:16,927
- You know the Amberlys?
- Yes.

1073
01:05:17,002 --> 01:05:18,936
Well, look at the way she went after them.

1074
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:21,438
That's the way she went after everybody.

1075
01:05:21,507 --> 01:05:24,203
I certainly don't want to speak
disrespectfully of the dead...

1076
01:05:24,276 --> 01:05:26,710
but that Nanny was strictly a purpose girl.

1077
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:28,838
Do you think she was hustling the Amberlys?

1078
01:05:28,914 --> 01:05:31,508
What else? Big rich family in Boston...

1079
01:05:31,584 --> 01:05:34,781
social register, nice unmarried boy.

1080
01:05:34,854 --> 01:05:38,221
- That was a big deal for her until you came along.
- But why me?

1081
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:43,193
Why not? You're a big character
- famous, plenty of dough.

1082
01:05:43,262 --> 01:05:45,253
Why take the kid if she could get you?

1083
01:05:45,331 --> 01:05:47,822
- But I wasn't interested in her.
- Oh, weren't you?

1084
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,834
Not in the way everybody thinks.

1085
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:51,870
What was it then, a shakedown?

1086
01:05:51,937 --> 01:05:54,428
I suppose so, but I can't tell you how.

1087
01:05:54,507 --> 01:05:56,498
She was gonna have a baby, you know.

1088
01:05:56,575 --> 01:06:00,204
- Wasn't yours?
- No, I'm just the chump she hung it on.

1089
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:03,373
- Well, then whose was it?
- That's what I'm tryin' to find out now.

1090
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:06,282
Did she have any other boyfriends
that you might know about?

1091
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:08,286
That I couldn't tell you.

1092
01:06:08,354 --> 01:06:11,482
Oh, she had 'em, all right, but
somewhere else, away from the joint.

1093
01:06:11,557 --> 01:06:13,650
That's all I ever saw, was her in the joint.

1094
01:06:13,726 --> 01:06:17,719
What about this girl that she lived with
before she moved in with the Amberlys?

1095
01:06:17,796 --> 01:06:20,264
That wasn't any girl she
lived with. That was a fella.

1096
01:06:20,332 --> 01:06:22,266
I forgot about him.

1097
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:24,427
- Are you sure about that?
- I'm positive.

1098
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:26,869
I took her paycheck there
once, and it was his place.

1099
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:30,238
- He answered the door.
- Can you remember that address?

1100
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:32,675
Matter of fact, I can.

1101
01:06:32,745 --> 01:06:35,714
Ninety-nine West Ninth.

1102
01:06:35,781 --> 01:06:37,715
Three nines in a row.

1103
01:06:37,783 --> 01:06:40,013
You don't know his name though?

1104
01:06:40,085 --> 01:06:44,320
No, I can't remember that. Just that he was
gray-haired and quite a good-looking guy.

1105
01:06:44,453 --> 01:06:46,921
Mm-hmm.

1106
01:06:46,989 --> 01:06:50,789
Well, that's something worth shooting
at anyway. Thank you very much, Anne.

1107
01:06:50,859 --> 01:06:54,488
- Cops after you for it?
- I guess so, by now.

1108
01:06:54,563 --> 01:06:56,531
Well, don't worry. I never saw you.

1109
01:06:56,598 --> 01:06:59,066
No, don't do that. Don't get
yourself mixed up in this.

1110
01:06:59,134 --> 01:07:01,932
If they ask you, you just tell
'em exactly what you've told me.

1111
01:07:02,004 --> 01:07:03,938
Okay then, if that's the way you want it.

1112
01:07:22,991 --> 01:07:24,982
May I come in?

1113
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,051
Certainly, Peter.

1114
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:47,115
- You've come about Nanny I suppose.
- You bet I have.

1115
01:07:47,182 --> 01:07:50,379
And I think you ought to know that
the police are coming down here too.

1116
01:07:50,452 --> 01:07:53,615
That fellow Bruce, that detective-

1117
01:07:53,689 --> 01:07:56,157
he talked to Sylvia on the coast.

1118
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:59,217
She told him that I was Nanny's uncle.

1119
01:08:00,362 --> 01:08:03,695
- You're Nanny's uncle?
- She's my sister's child.

1120
01:08:03,766 --> 01:08:06,064
Then why didn't you say so before?

1121
01:08:06,135 --> 01:08:08,535
- Well, I assumed that you knew that anyway.
- Well, I didn't.

1122
01:08:08,604 --> 01:08:10,834
So what else you been holding back?

1123
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:15,772
I don't know how you want
me to answer that, Peter.

1124
01:08:15,844 --> 01:08:18,870
You knew she had a lover, didn't you?

1125
01:08:18,947 --> 01:08:22,405
- Yes, I knew it.
- You know who he was?

1126
01:08:22,484 --> 01:08:24,475
- Yes.
- Well, who?

1127
01:08:26,388 --> 01:08:29,118
I'm not gonna argue with
you about this, Gordon.

1128
01:08:29,191 --> 01:08:33,150
Now, if she had a lover, that's the man
that killed her. And I want his name.

1129
01:08:34,163 --> 01:08:36,825
Now let's have it.

1130
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:39,527
- Killed her?
- That's right, killed her. She was murdered.

1131
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:41,535
Now is that clear to you?

1132
01:08:41,603 --> 01:08:43,594
Oh, good heavens.

1133
01:08:44,907 --> 01:08:48,502
Oh, no, Peter. Oh, it can't be.

1134
01:08:48,577 --> 01:08:50,568
Who was he?

1135
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,414
- Oh, please, Peter.
- Who was he? Tell me.

1136
01:08:57,386 --> 01:09:00,446
Well, she told me it was you.

1137
01:09:04,393 --> 01:09:06,327
Gordon, you're lying to me.

1138
01:09:06,395 --> 01:09:08,386
That's what she said. I swear it.

1139
01:09:17,873 --> 01:09:19,807
When did she say that?

1140
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:23,538
<i>- The day- The day before she
died. - What else did she say?</i>

1141
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:26,672
She told me everything.
She told me the whole story.

1142
01:09:26,748 --> 01:09:29,046
All right, then suppose you tell it to me.

1143
01:09:31,253 --> 01:09:35,952
Well, I knew that she'd been
bringing somebody here when I was out.

1144
01:09:36,024 --> 01:09:37,958
She still had a key to the place.

1145
01:09:38,026 --> 01:09:41,484
But I had no idea who it was...

1146
01:09:41,563 --> 01:09:46,933
until that day she came here
crying and half out of her mind.

1147
01:09:47,002 --> 01:09:48,936
And then she told me the whole story.

1148
01:09:49,004 --> 01:09:51,404
And she actually said me by name?

1149
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:53,407
Yes.

1150
01:09:53,475 --> 01:09:55,409
Uh, not at first, but, uh-

1151
01:09:55,477 --> 01:09:57,411
Who did she say at first?

1152
01:09:58,514 --> 01:10:00,948
Well, I meant she didn't say any names first.

1153
01:10:01,016 --> 01:10:03,610
She was pretty hysterical, you understand.

1154
01:10:03,685 --> 01:10:05,619
And even when she went on about this man...

1155
01:10:05,687 --> 01:10:08,053
and about his being married
to a famous wife and all...

1156
01:10:08,123 --> 01:10:12,184
and what a fight she'd
probably make against a divorce-

1157
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:15,719
Even then it wasn't until she said Iris...

1158
01:10:17,266 --> 01:10:20,963
that I realized you were the
one she was talking about.

1159
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:32,140
<i>And then when I heard she
was dead in your apartment-</i>

1160
01:10:32,214 --> 01:10:35,445
<i>Well, it was then I decided
not to say anything to anybody.</i>

1161
01:10:36,852 --> 01:10:40,845
Just, uh-Just tell me one more thing.

1162
01:10:40,923 --> 01:10:42,857
Whatever I can, Peter.

1163
01:10:42,925 --> 01:10:46,656
You say, at first, that you
didn't realize she meant me.

1164
01:10:46,728 --> 01:10:49,754
Who did you think she meant at first?

1165
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:53,096
<i>Why, as a matter of fact-</i>

1166
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,304
- Is that them?
- I suppose so.

1167
01:10:57,372 --> 01:11:00,205
- How do I get out of here?
- You're not gonna run away, are you?

1168
01:11:00,275 --> 01:11:02,300
Is there a door at the back of this hall?

1169
01:11:02,377 --> 01:11:04,368
Yes, but don't you think
that's rather foolish?

1170
01:11:04,446 --> 01:11:06,471
They're bound to catch you sooner or later.

1171
01:11:15,424 --> 01:11:18,052
- May we come in?
- Right in here.

1172
01:11:30,906 --> 01:11:34,808
- Can I, uh, fix you a drink?
- No, thanks.

1173
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:38,471
- We'd just like to ask you one question.
- Yes?

1174
01:11:38,547 --> 01:11:41,573
We'd like for you to tell us
everything you just told Mr. Denver.

1175
01:12:25,427 --> 01:12:28,885
Oh, darling. Oh, I'm so sorry.

1176
01:12:30,599 --> 01:12:32,590
That's all right, honey.

1177
01:12:32,668 --> 01:12:36,263
Miss Mills just told me, but neither
of us knew where to look for you.

1178
01:12:36,338 --> 01:12:38,272
She tell you what they say now?

1179
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,274
What idiocy.

1180
01:12:40,342 --> 01:12:43,106
You may be dumb about some things,
but you're not dumb enough...

1181
01:12:43,178 --> 01:12:46,511
to kill someone in your own
apartment and then leave her there.

1182
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:55,781
Then all I've got to do now
is sell that to the cops.

1183
01:12:55,857 --> 01:12:58,348
Have you any idea yet?

1184
01:12:58,427 --> 01:13:00,952
Yeah. A very good idea.

1185
01:13:01,029 --> 01:13:04,726
- Who?
- I think it was Brian.

1186
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,428
- Brian?
- That's who I think it was.

1187
01:13:07,502 --> 01:13:09,493
But Brian's such a nothing.

1188
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:12,165
I don't know, of course, but...

1189
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,572
I've been slamming around
town like a TV detective...

1190
01:13:14,643 --> 01:13:16,634
and that's the way it looks to me.

1191
01:13:16,712 --> 01:13:19,681
All I can prove though is
that I wasn't her sweetie.

1192
01:13:19,748 --> 01:13:21,682
How can you prove that?

1193
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,651
Because she was talkin'
about this guy on June 2...

1194
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,654
and I hadn't even met her on June 2.

1195
01:13:26,722 --> 01:13:30,351
I never met her until the day you
left town, which was June 6, remember?

1196
01:13:30,425 --> 01:13:33,792
- Did Brian know her then?
- That I don't know either.

1197
01:13:33,862 --> 01:13:37,559
But she was already
talking about a famous wife.

1198
01:13:37,632 --> 01:13:41,534
And then just about 10 minutes ago...

1199
01:13:41,603 --> 01:13:46,631
it finally began to trickle
into this thick skull of mine...

1200
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:50,804
that I'm not the only character
around town with a celebrated wife.

1201
01:13:50,879 --> 01:13:52,813
Well, then that's it, isn't it?

1202
01:13:52,881 --> 01:13:55,247
For me maybe, but not for
the police, I'm afraid.

1203
01:13:55,317 --> 01:13:57,342
Not yet anyway.

1204
01:13:57,419 --> 01:14:01,583
No, what I- I really
think I better do now is-

1205
01:14:01,656 --> 01:14:03,647
What?

1206
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,758
You feel like helping me a bit with this?

1207
01:14:09,531 --> 01:14:11,761
You name it, honey.

1208
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:15,667
I want Lottie out of their
apartment for about an hour or so...

1209
01:14:15,737 --> 01:14:18,001
so I can have a little talk with Brian.

1210
01:14:18,073 --> 01:14:20,007
Think you can manage that?

1211
01:14:20,075 --> 01:14:22,134
You watch and wait and see.

1212
01:14:31,286 --> 01:14:33,220
Hello?

1213
01:14:33,288 --> 01:14:35,449
Hello. Is Lottie there, Brian?

1214
01:14:35,524 --> 01:14:37,515
Right here, darling. How are you?

1215
01:14:37,592 --> 01:14:40,288
I'm all right. Thank you.
Will you put her on, please?

1216
01:14:40,362 --> 01:14:42,557
Of course, darling. Just one moment.

1217
01:14:42,631 --> 01:14:44,565
Poor Lottie.

1218
01:14:44,633 --> 01:14:47,033
Iris, darling, where are you?

1219
01:14:47,102 --> 01:14:49,696
Are you doing anything important right now?

1220
01:14:49,771 --> 01:14:52,001
I'll be right over. Where are you?

1221
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:54,735
Well, I'll be back at my
hotel. I'm at the Grenada.

1222
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:57,074
- In 15 minutes?
- I'll be there.

1223
01:14:57,145 --> 01:15:00,376
I've been wanting to talk to
you all day. What's the room?

1224
01:15:00,448 --> 01:15:01,938
Room 411.

1225
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,151
Oh. Come in.

1226
01:15:16,832 --> 01:15:19,801
Lottie just went out
- to see Iris, as a matter of fact.

1227
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:22,860
I know. I asked Iris to call her.

1228
01:15:22,938 --> 01:15:25,099
Oh, really? Would you like a drink?

1229
01:15:25,173 --> 01:15:27,107
No, thanks. Not now.

1230
01:15:28,109 --> 01:15:30,942
I've just been talking to Gordon.

1231
01:15:31,012 --> 01:15:33,276
Gordon Ling?

1232
01:15:33,348 --> 01:15:35,714
He told me about you and Nanny.

1233
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,724
Who told him?

1234
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:46,022
He just put two and two together.

1235
01:15:48,363 --> 01:15:50,991
Is that what Iris is gonna tell Lottie?

1236
01:15:51,066 --> 01:15:54,126
No, but I'd like you to tell
me about it, if you don't mind.

1237
01:15:54,202 --> 01:15:57,000
I'm terribly sorry, Peter.

1238
01:15:57,072 --> 01:16:00,007
I'm sure you are, but that's
not gonna be enough this time.

1239
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:02,066
I'm being chased for murder, remember?

1240
01:16:02,143 --> 01:16:04,976
I was just too scared to say anything at all.

1241
01:16:05,046 --> 01:16:07,844
And it wasn't murder then, you
know, and you were already in it.

1242
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:09,907
Go on.

1243
01:16:09,985 --> 01:16:14,319
You don't know what it means to be
married to a woman like Lottie...

1244
01:16:14,389 --> 01:16:16,323
but I'll tell you this.

1245
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:19,121
It's pretty lonely at times.

1246
01:16:19,194 --> 01:16:21,685
Pretty humiliating too...

1247
01:16:21,763 --> 01:16:23,890
when you let yourself think about it.

1248
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:29,603
"Rich actress's kept husband,"
and all that sort of talk.

1249
01:16:29,671 --> 01:16:31,832
Get on with it, will you?

1250
01:16:34,009 --> 01:16:36,842
And so when this thing started with Nanny...

1251
01:16:36,912 --> 01:16:39,506
it was a new kind of life for me-

1252
01:16:39,581 --> 01:16:43,278
loved like that, and being
treated with, really, respect.

1253
01:16:43,351 --> 01:16:45,911
You know what I mean?

1254
01:16:45,987 --> 01:16:47,978
I know what you mean. Go on.

1255
01:16:49,124 --> 01:16:51,786
It was really pretty wonderful, and then...

1256
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:56,490
all of a sudden I realized that this
girl was almost literally insane about me.

1257
01:16:56,564 --> 01:16:59,158
It was no use trying to
make her understand...

1258
01:16:59,234 --> 01:17:01,327
that I couldn't get a divorce from Lottie.

1259
01:17:01,403 --> 01:17:03,371
Not that I wanted one, to tell the truth.

1260
01:17:03,438 --> 01:17:06,566
But even if I had, Lottie would never
have gone for a deal like that...

1261
01:17:06,641 --> 01:17:08,575
in a thousand years, and I knew it.

1262
01:17:09,878 --> 01:17:13,712
<i>So I told her that even if I
was able to find a way out...</i>

1263
01:17:13,782 --> 01:17:16,342
how was I going to support her?

1264
01:17:16,418 --> 01:17:19,387
I've never been able to
make a decent living, Peter.

1265
01:17:19,454 --> 01:17:21,786
I don't kid myself about that.

1266
01:17:21,856 --> 01:17:24,450
I'm a hitchhiker.

1267
01:17:24,526 --> 01:17:27,461
Without Lottie, I'd be
doing good not to starve.

1268
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:29,520
You know that as well as I do.

1269
01:17:29,597 --> 01:17:32,259
So what did you do?

1270
01:17:32,334 --> 01:17:35,735
Are you sure you want me
to go on about this, Peter?

1271
01:17:37,238 --> 01:17:39,229
Why not?

1272
01:17:41,242 --> 01:17:43,870
Well, then she started to threaten me.

1273
01:17:43,945 --> 01:17:46,175
She was going to tell Lottie.

1274
01:17:46,247 --> 01:17:48,215
That's when I really began to get panicky.

1275
01:17:48,283 --> 01:17:51,184
- About the baby?
- Well, that's the strange part of it.

1276
01:17:51,252 --> 01:17:53,447
I didn't know anything about
the baby until that afternoon.

1277
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:55,751
What afternoon?

1278
01:17:57,359 --> 01:17:59,293
That afternoon in your apartment.

1279
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:02,194
What happened then?

1280
01:18:04,032 --> 01:18:07,832
Well, it was about 2:00 when she called me.

1281
01:18:07,902 --> 01:18:10,370
Lottie was out, thank
heavens, at the photographer's.

1282
01:18:10,505 --> 01:18:12,370
Are you alone?

1283
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,533
Yes, but you shouldn't
call me in the daytime.

1284
01:18:14,609 --> 01:18:18,511
- I've asked you.
- I won't do it again, but I had to this time.

1285
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,605
I've got something very
wonderful to tell you.

1286
01:18:20,682 --> 01:18:22,616
Will you come down here?

1287
01:18:22,684 --> 01:18:25,517
- Now look, dear-
- Please, darling.

1288
01:18:26,588 --> 01:18:28,852
This is very dangerous, you know.

1289
01:18:28,923 --> 01:18:30,857
Now stop worrying.

1290
01:18:30,925 --> 01:18:34,156
Lucia's gone and Peter
won't be back until 6:00.

1291
01:18:34,229 --> 01:18:38,393
This may be the very last time we'll have
to sneak around and be scared like this.

1292
01:18:47,342 --> 01:18:49,708
Because I've fixed it so we can be married.

1293
01:18:53,415 --> 01:18:57,647
- You do love me, don't you?
- You know I do, darling, but I've told you how impossible it is.

1294
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:01,621
Then it's got to be done, Brian,
because we're going to have a child.

1295
01:19:02,724 --> 01:19:04,817
I'd do anything on earth-

1296
01:19:04,893 --> 01:19:08,920
I'd give half my life if I could
make you as happy about it as I am.

1297
01:19:10,098 --> 01:19:12,623
Nanny, darling...

1298
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,964
if only there was some
reasonable way for us-

1299
01:19:15,036 --> 01:19:18,938
- But there is now, if you love me enough.
- How?

1300
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:22,135
Because I'm going to get some money-

1301
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:24,940
so much money that you'll be
able to leave that woman...

1302
01:19:25,013 --> 01:19:27,982
and then never have to worry
about that part of it again.

1303
01:19:28,049 --> 01:19:32,645
- Well, what do you mean?
- I'm going to get it from Peter.

1304
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:36,850
I'm going to send a lawyer
to him about our child.

1305
01:19:36,925 --> 01:19:38,859
Are you joking?

1306
01:19:38,927 --> 01:19:40,861
Of course not.

1307
01:19:40,929 --> 01:19:43,193
Peter's rich.

1308
01:19:43,264 --> 01:19:45,926
Don't you think it would
be worth $50,000 to him...

1309
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,298
to keep a story like that out of the papers?

1310
01:19:49,771 --> 01:19:51,705
You must be joking.

1311
01:19:51,773 --> 01:19:54,264
Don't you want to marry me?

1312
01:19:54,342 --> 01:19:58,108
- I do, darling, but what you're saying is insane.
- Why is it?

1313
01:19:58,179 --> 01:20:00,511
Well, for one thing, you'd
never get away with it.

1314
01:20:00,582 --> 01:20:02,880
But it's already fixed, I tell you.

1315
01:20:02,951 --> 01:20:06,045
Claire Amberly knows it,
Uncle Gordon knows it...

1316
01:20:06,121 --> 01:20:09,386
and I've even written to his
wife and told her about it.

1317
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:11,391
Well, this is really crazy.

1318
01:20:11,459 --> 01:20:13,689
Peter's my friend. He's been
your friend. How could you-

1319
01:20:13,761 --> 01:20:16,525
Do you mean you're more concerned
about him than you are about me?

1320
01:20:16,598 --> 01:20:19,590
Well, that's not it at all. It's
just that you simply can't do this...

1321
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:21,692
to a perfectly decent, innocent person.

1322
01:20:21,769 --> 01:20:24,932
- Then what would you say if I sent the
lawyer to you? - Now listen, darling-

1323
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:28,305
How would you like that in the papers? "Carlotta
Marin's Husband Father's Girl's Child. "

1324
01:20:28,376 --> 01:20:31,368
- Think you'd like that better? - Don't
be a fool. All I'm trying to tell you-

1325
01:20:31,446 --> 01:20:34,074
All you're trying to tell me is
you want to leave me this way!

1326
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:35,946
You want everyone in
the building to hear you?

1327
01:20:36,017 --> 01:20:38,008
You bet I do! I want everybody in the world-

1328
01:20:39,521 --> 01:20:41,455
Very clever, Mr. Denver.

1329
01:20:41,523 --> 01:20:44,253
It's just too bad your wife wasn't
actress enough to carry it off.

1330
01:20:44,325 --> 01:20:46,555
What's he trying to pull over here?

1331
01:20:46,628 --> 01:20:48,562
Go on, tell her.

1332
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:51,497
I couldn't help it, darling.
The girl was murdered.

1333
01:20:51,566 --> 01:20:53,898
I don't believe it.

1334
01:20:53,968 --> 01:20:56,402
It's true nevertheless, Miss Marin.

1335
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,900
Then why don't you arrest him?

1336
01:21:01,976 --> 01:21:04,706
- Arrest who?
- Who do you think?

1337
01:21:07,048 --> 01:21:10,575
I think first I'd like to hear
the rest of Mr. Mullen's story.

1338
01:21:10,652 --> 01:21:14,713
Sergeant Welch, who has rather an old
- fashioned approach to criminal investigation...

1339
01:21:14,789 --> 01:21:18,122
was thoughtful enough to leave this
little mike here this afternoon...

1340
01:21:18,193 --> 01:21:22,562
so we were able to listen to the first
part of it in the office downstairs.

1341
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:26,088
Can I persuade you to continue with it now?

1342
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:28,101
What's he talking about?

1343
01:21:28,169 --> 01:21:30,330
Mr. Mullen was tellin' us
about a discussion he had...

1344
01:21:30,405 --> 01:21:33,374
with Miss Ordway the other
afternoon in the Denver apartment.

1345
01:21:33,441 --> 01:21:36,433
According to this version, she wanted
to blame their baby on Mr. Denver-

1346
01:21:36,511 --> 01:21:39,712
<i>an idea to which Mr. Mullen said he objected.</i>

1347
01:21:42,014 --> 01:21:43,948
It's not true.

1348
01:21:50,389 --> 01:21:52,357
Will you go on from there?

1349
01:21:55,861 --> 01:22:00,093
She quieted down then, but she
still insisted on that insane idea.

1350
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,998
Whichever you wish. I can send
the lawyer to him or to you.

1351
01:22:03,068 --> 01:22:05,559
- I don't care which.
- But it can't be done that way, Nanny.

1352
01:22:05,637 --> 01:22:07,798
Either way, you'll bring the
whole house down on everybody.

1353
01:22:07,873 --> 01:22:10,603
Nobody wins. We've got to find
some sensible way out of this thing.

1354
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,610
All right, then you suggest one.

1355
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:15,806
That's impossible right this moment. You
have to give me time to think about it.

1356
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:18,645
- How much time?
- How can I answer that either?

1357
01:22:18,717 --> 01:22:22,278
But don't you think it'd be better in any case
to wait until we're less upset emotionally...

1358
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,754
and then try to find a way out calmly?

1359
01:22:24,823 --> 01:22:28,691
All right. I'll give you exactly 15 minutes
- until 3:00.

1360
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:31,696
And then you can tell me whom
you want the lawyer to go to.

1361
01:22:31,764 --> 01:22:33,698
Please, Nanny, you're behaving like an idiot.

1362
01:22:33,766 --> 01:22:36,633
<i>Let me in. Let me in.</i>

1363
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:55,182
- Yes?
- Well, are you going to answer me or not?

1364
01:22:55,254 --> 01:22:58,485
- Look, darling- - Look, Brian, I
don't want to argue anymore with you.

1365
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,219
All I want to know is
if you're with me or not.

1366
01:23:01,293 --> 01:23:03,227
Yes, I'm with you.

1367
01:23:04,429 --> 01:23:06,363
Oh, darling, I'm so glad.

1368
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:09,059
I can't tell you how glad I am.

1369
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:11,227
You do love me, don't you?

1370
01:23:11,303 --> 01:23:13,237
I do.

1371
01:23:13,305 --> 01:23:15,432
And think what it'll do for us, darling.

1372
01:23:15,507 --> 01:23:19,739
You'll be free. We'll have more
money than we can possibly need.

1373
01:23:19,812 --> 01:23:23,111
And we'll have a home
together with our child.

1374
01:23:23,182 --> 01:23:25,844
Doesn't that sound worth
anything we have to do to get it?

1375
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,011
I suppose so, but-

1376
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,281
But they can stand it, darling.

1377
01:23:30,355 --> 01:23:33,847
They're rich and famous
and important. We're not.

1378
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:36,827
Oh, they've got other things
to make up for a little trouble.

1379
01:23:36,895 --> 01:23:39,796
Maybe it'll bother 'em for a
week or two or even a month...

1380
01:23:39,865 --> 01:23:42,095
but then it'll all be over for them.

1381
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:46,035
They've got other interests.
Peter will make the money back.

1382
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:49,301
Meantime, look what it'll do for us.

1383
01:23:49,374 --> 01:23:51,968
Can't you think of it that
way for just a little while?

1384
01:23:53,478 --> 01:23:55,412
I'll try.

1385
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,471
Will you come down here now?

1386
01:23:57,549 --> 01:24:00,848
I can't now. I'm expecting
Lottie back about 3:30.

1387
01:24:00,919 --> 01:24:04,753
- Just for a few minutes.
- No. I'll call you tomorrow.

1388
01:24:04,823 --> 01:24:07,053
Please, darling.

1389
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,992
All right then, but just for a few minutes.

1390
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:11,996
Just tap at the door.

1391
01:24:12,064 --> 01:24:14,055
All right.

1392
01:24:21,073 --> 01:24:23,007
<i>Go on.</i>

1393
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,234
That's all there was to it.

1394
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,802
- You mean that's all you're gonna tell us?
-  Nothing more to tell.

1395
01:24:28,881 --> 01:24:32,908
While I was getting up enough courage
to go down and see her, Lottie came in.

1396
01:24:34,519 --> 01:24:36,510
I'm sorry, darling.

1397
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:46,320
- It's a very extraordinary story, Mr. Mullen.
- It's the truth.

1398
01:24:46,398 --> 01:24:49,492
Downstairs all alone in an
apartment was a young woman...

1399
01:24:49,568 --> 01:24:53,299
who was threatening to expose you to
your wife as the father of her child.

1400
01:24:53,372 --> 01:24:56,808
A few hours later she's found dead
- murdered.

1401
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:59,400
Do you know all you need to
establish a case for murder?

1402
01:24:59,478 --> 01:25:01,412
I didn't kill her, I tell you.

1403
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,176
You only need two things
- a motive and an opportunity.

1404
01:25:04,249 --> 01:25:06,444
You're a man of intelligence,
so I invite you...

1405
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,918
to examine your own story in
the light of those two facts.

1406
01:25:08,987 --> 01:25:11,979
I didn't do it. I don't know
who did it, but I didn't do it.

1407
01:25:12,057 --> 01:25:15,288
Then suppose we offered this case as
we have it now to a court and jury.

1408
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,329
- How would you disprove it?
- I don't know, but I didn't do it.

1409
01:25:18,397 --> 01:25:21,298
- The truth is that you did go back down there, didn't you?
- I didn't.

1410
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:24,199
You didn't go back and try to
persuade her again to drop her threats?

1411
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:26,703
I wanted to, but I didn't. I
- I hadn't got the guts.

1412
01:25:26,772 --> 01:25:30,173
You didn't stop her screams this time with
your hands on her throat until she was dead?

1413
01:25:30,242 --> 01:25:33,541
- As God is my judge, I- - Then
who do you think did, Mr. Mullen?

1414
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,714
Didn't Peter?

1415
01:25:39,418 --> 01:25:41,352
What makes you think that?

1416
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,911
Well, I took it for granted
he came home unexpectedly...

1417
01:25:43,989 --> 01:25:46,150
and she told him what she was going to do.

1418
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,387
Have you any evidence of any
kind to support that suggestion?

1419
01:25:49,461 --> 01:25:51,452
I have.

1420
01:25:53,131 --> 01:25:55,122
What sort of evidence, Miss Marin?

1421
01:25:56,835 --> 01:25:59,429
Everybody's known about
Peter and the girl for weeks.

1422
01:25:59,504 --> 01:26:03,406
<i>But he was a friend of mine.</i>

1423
01:26:03,475 --> 01:26:06,808
Is that why you accused him
of the murder twice already?

1424
01:26:06,878 --> 01:26:11,645
I accused him because I knew you
had nothing actual against him.

1425
01:26:11,717 --> 01:26:15,448
It's better that I be set down as a
wicked, jealous, spiteful woman than that-

1426
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,621
Than that your husband should be suspected?

1427
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:23,661
Yes.

1428
01:26:23,729 --> 01:26:26,596
You mean you knew about
your husband and the girl?

1429
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,491
No.

1430
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:40,906
Not until just now.

1431
01:26:40,979 --> 01:26:45,507
I knew there was someone,
but I had no idea it was her.

1432
01:26:45,584 --> 01:26:47,950
I thought she was Peter's girl.

1433
01:26:49,521 --> 01:26:51,989
I knew nothing about Brian and her.

1434
01:26:52,057 --> 01:26:53,991
But that's not evidence, Miss Marin.

1435
01:26:54,059 --> 01:26:55,993
Is that all you've got to tell us?

1436
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:58,029
No.

1437
01:26:58,096 --> 01:27:02,055
I was willing to keep
quiet for Mr. Denver's sake-

1438
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:04,762
for the sake of anyone who
has been as close to me...

1439
01:27:04,836 --> 01:27:06,963
<i>as he and Mrs. Denver have been.</i>

1440
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:09,303
But not at the risk of my husband's life...

1441
01:27:09,374 --> 01:27:11,308
regardless of what he's done to me.

1442
01:27:11,376 --> 01:27:13,901
<i>He's hurt me...</i>

1443
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:17,142
<i>he's destroyed my love and happiness...</i>

1444
01:27:17,215 --> 01:27:20,150
but he's still not a murderer.

1445
01:27:20,218 --> 01:27:22,311
Go on.

1446
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:29,526
I came home that afternoon from
the photographer's around 3:00...

1447
01:27:29,594 --> 01:27:32,324
with the proofs of the pictures
that Mr. Denver had ordered.

1448
01:27:32,397 --> 01:27:36,197
<i>I knew he was anxious to see
them as soon as possible...</i>

1449
01:27:36,268 --> 01:27:38,634
<i>so I decided to stop off at his apartment...</i>

1450
01:27:38,703 --> 01:27:41,604
<i>in case he should be
there to show them to him.</i>

1451
01:27:45,043 --> 01:27:47,011
<i>Let go, Peter.! Let me go.!</i>

1452
01:27:47,079 --> 01:27:49,343
<i>I'll let you go when
you come to your senses.!</i>

1453
01:27:49,414 --> 01:27:51,905
<i>Help, police.! Police.!</i>

1454
01:27:57,255 --> 01:28:00,588
- And that was a little after 3:00 you say?
-  It was.

1455
01:28:00,659 --> 01:28:03,753
And are you prepared to swear
to that statement, Miss Marin?

1456
01:28:03,829 --> 01:28:05,820
I am.

1457
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,857
She's lying. I know it.

1458
01:28:11,236 --> 01:28:14,364
- Mr. Oliver, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

1459
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:17,374
- Do you know this young man?
- No.

1460
01:28:17,442 --> 01:28:20,775
He's an actor
- temporarily without a vehicle.

1461
01:28:20,846 --> 01:28:22,837
I'm afraid I don't remember.

1462
01:28:22,914 --> 01:28:25,542
Mr. Grady, my agent, took
me in to see Mr. Denver...

1463
01:28:25,617 --> 01:28:28,177
when he was casting the Duncan
play about two years ago.

1464
01:28:28,253 --> 01:28:30,187
That was just for a few moments, of course.

1465
01:28:30,255 --> 01:28:32,985
Oh, yes. I remember now. You're the
boy that Mr. Kaufman recommended.

1466
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,992
- Yes, sir. That's right.
- Yes.

1467
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,995
- Have you seen Mr. Denver since?
- Yes, sir.

1468
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,258
- When?
- The other afternoon.

1469
01:28:40,332 --> 01:28:42,960
Uh, Thursday afternoon when
he came into the Star Theater.

1470
01:28:43,034 --> 01:28:45,093
- And you're sure it was him?
- Oh, sure.

1471
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:47,331
Most actors know Mr. Denver by sight anyway.

1472
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,339
And what time was that?

1473
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:53,935
Oh, he came in about 2:30, I
should say, and he left about 4:30.

1474
01:28:54,012 --> 01:28:56,776
What makes you so certain about those hours?

1475
01:28:56,848 --> 01:28:59,612
Well, I was planning to speak
to him when he came out...

1476
01:28:59,684 --> 01:29:01,618
about a part.

1477
01:29:04,823 --> 01:29:06,984
So I was keeping an eye on him...

1478
01:29:07,058 --> 01:29:10,084
but sometime after 4:30, he
got out without my seeing him.

1479
01:29:10,162 --> 01:29:13,188
You mean you hung around there
all that time just to speak to him?

1480
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:17,292
I wasn't just hanging around.
I work there, taking tickets.

1481
01:29:17,369 --> 01:29:19,837
Temporarily, of course.

1482
01:29:23,341 --> 01:29:26,367
And you're still willing to swear
to that statement, Miss Marin?

1483
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:32,439
<i>Okay then. You're under arrest, Mr. Mullen.</i>

1484
01:29:32,517 --> 01:29:34,451
But he didn't do it!

1485
01:29:34,519 --> 01:29:37,682
Don't you think you interfered
in this thing enough already?

1486
01:29:39,191 --> 01:29:41,125
He couldn't have!

1487
01:29:41,193 --> 01:29:43,127
How do you know he couldn't have, Miss Marin?

1488
01:29:43,195 --> 01:29:45,629
Because I know him. I know
what kind of person he is.

1489
01:29:45,697 --> 01:29:47,927
No, no, Miss Marin. That's
not what you meant at all.

1490
01:29:47,999 --> 01:29:50,524
You meant something else entirely.

1491
01:29:50,602 --> 01:29:53,366
May I suggest what it was?

1492
01:29:53,438 --> 01:29:56,407
Everybody else has taken
a shot at what happened.

1493
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,408
Perhaps I can offer a version too.

1494
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:00,410
What do you think of this, Miss Marin?

1495
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:02,946
Will you come down here now?

1496
01:30:03,014 --> 01:30:05,642
I can't now. I'm expecting
Lottie back about 3:30.

1497
01:30:05,717 --> 01:30:09,312
- Just for a few minutes.
- No. I'll call you tomorrow.

1498
01:30:09,387 --> 01:30:11,878
Please, darling.

1499
01:30:11,957 --> 01:30:15,051
All right then, but just for a few minutes.

1500
01:30:15,126 --> 01:30:17,720
- Just tap on the door.
- All right.

1501
01:31:17,455 --> 01:31:19,389
What do you want here?

1502
01:31:19,457 --> 01:31:22,358
You filthy, dirty little beast.

1503
01:31:22,427 --> 01:31:24,361
You get out of here.

1504
01:31:25,597 --> 01:31:27,929
You're the one who's
going to get out of here...

1505
01:31:27,999 --> 01:31:31,093
and out of New York too if
you know what's good for you.

1506
01:31:31,169 --> 01:31:33,103
I don't know what you're talking about.

1507
01:31:33,171 --> 01:31:36,163
You don't have to. All you've
got to do is get out and stay out.

1508
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:38,175
That ought to be clear enough.

1509
01:31:46,151 --> 01:31:48,085
There.

1510
01:31:48,153 --> 01:31:50,121
And if ever you try to see him again...

1511
01:31:50,188 --> 01:31:53,123
I promise you now you'll be
sorry for it as long as you live.

1512
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:04,067
You just wait until I tell him about this.

1513
01:32:04,135 --> 01:32:07,502
Did you hear what I said?

1514
01:32:07,572 --> 01:32:10,439
Maybe you're the one who's
going to be sorry for this.

1515
01:32:10,508 --> 01:32:15,036
You try to see him again and you'll
soon find out who's going to be sorry.

1516
01:32:16,815 --> 01:32:19,807
You dreadful old woman. Do you really
think this will do you any good?

1517
01:32:19,884 --> 01:32:23,547
- Are you going to get out or not?
- He loathes you. He despises you.

1518
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:25,851
- And if you don't believe
it, ask him. - I've told you-

1519
01:32:25,924 --> 01:32:28,051
You don't dare to, because
you know what he'd say.

1520
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:30,959
He's sick of you and your meanness,
and he's sick of being a slave.

1521
01:32:31,029 --> 01:32:33,122
He hates you! He hates you!

1522
01:32:41,506 --> 01:32:43,440
<i>How about that, Miss Marin?</i>

1523
01:32:43,508 --> 01:32:45,669
- It's not true!
- No?

1524
01:32:45,744 --> 01:32:47,974
It's a complete lie, you've
made the whole thing up...

1525
01:32:48,046 --> 01:32:50,105
and you can't prove one word of it!

1526
01:32:50,181 --> 01:32:53,582
I got this in your kitchen
this morning, Miss Marin.

1527
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:55,676
Is it yours?

1528
01:32:55,754 --> 01:32:57,847
It's some scribbles and a grocery order.

1529
01:32:57,922 --> 01:32:59,981
Mr. Mullen said it was yours.

1530
01:33:03,728 --> 01:33:07,994
Now, uh, the police lab
tells me that this drawing...

1531
01:33:08,066 --> 01:33:10,500
which we took to be by the girl...

1532
01:33:10,568 --> 01:33:13,128
was actually drawn by the same
hand and same ballpoint pen...

1533
01:33:13,204 --> 01:33:16,298
that did those doodles-which you did.

1534
01:33:16,374 --> 01:33:19,104
In fact, that's all we
had to go on until you-

1535
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:21,168
Lottie!

1536
01:33:24,282 --> 01:33:27,740
You don't hate me, do you?

1537
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:30,219
Please tell me.

1538
01:33:30,288 --> 01:33:32,483
Please!

1539
01:33:44,135 --> 01:33:47,434
Nancy Ordway's trouble was that she was
a purpose girl who forgot her purpose.

1540
01:33:47,505 --> 01:33:49,439
She fell in love.

1541
01:33:49,507 --> 01:33:53,671
Unfortunately, the fellow she fell in love
with was Miss Carlotta Marin's husband.

1542
01:33:53,745 --> 01:33:58,205
Personally, I'd just as soon try to
take something away from Rocky Marciano.

1543
01:33:58,283 --> 01:34:00,217
What do you think they'll do to Lottie?

1544
01:34:00,285 --> 01:34:03,652
That I couldn't tell. A thing
like that's up to the jury.

1545
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,689
I can hardly wait.

1546
01:34:05,757 --> 01:34:07,725
Why, Peter.

1547
01:34:07,792 --> 01:34:10,317
No, I mean, for one of the greatest...

1548
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:14,195
dramatic actresses in this
country to open in court.

1549
01:34:16,134 --> 01:34:19,228
I can already see her in the witness chair-

1550
01:34:19,304 --> 01:34:21,238
without any makeup...

1551
01:34:21,306 --> 01:34:25,003
her hair just a little straggled and gray...

1552
01:34:26,377 --> 01:34:30,814
wearing a rather faded print
dress from a bargain basement...

1553
01:34:32,116 --> 01:34:34,584
and no girdle.

1554
01:34:34,652 --> 01:34:38,645
And when this poor, brave,
pathetic little housewife...

1555
01:34:38,723 --> 01:34:41,453
gets through with that jury-

1556
01:34:41,526 --> 01:34:43,960
They'll probably convict me.

1557
01:34:44,028 --> 01:34:47,054
That is not impossible.
